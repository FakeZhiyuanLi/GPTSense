      Bar manager wasn't in when I handed in my application so now I have to wait for a call back.  Not hopeful since the form was so basic and didn't allow me room to put much more than education and my oh so irrelevant work experience.  Boo-hoo.  Just now, I got offer to ride in Civic Type R this saturday and I can't believe I had to turn down once again.  Plus it would have been a ride all the way to Thorpe Park and free entry too... Arghhh!!  No ride, no sexy engine, no theme park.... I'm gonna cry!

      The tune to this is stuck in my head! I don't even have it on my mp3...   Why do they call you sexy, I'll tell you why they call you,  Cuz your pants be sagging & your smile be banging,  A cool little gangsta style - baby    Why do they call you sexy, I'll tell you why they call you,  Cuz your hips be showing & your lips be singing,  There's so many reasons to call you sexy

      Looks like I can start filling out my application to work at Boudoir and maybe memorise some favourite / classic cocktails too.  My DB contract says I must get permission first but shouldn't be a problem so long as there's no conflict of interest.  Feels like I've told everyone about this (except colleagues).  Will be awfully embarrassing if I can't even get a job to work in a bar.  Then again, Fai said it's a profession... and this is quite a nice bar.  I want to mix drinks, I want to create something that people can enjoy, and I want to grind mint leaves to music, haha!  Please let them love me enough to want to train me up! I will be so disappointed otherwise...  I can't believe I'm applying to work in a bar before the floristry thing!  I have to say, this is mainly for fun... where as floristry was a business idea involving financial risks etc... making it somewhat more daunting...  Well, that plus the fact that I can't drive means I haven't pursued any casual work in a florist. I'll see how I feel after I pass my driving test!

      Was going to take some presents over to my cousin mid-week but due to the oh so annoying (and too damn frequent) planned industrial action of RMT union, I had to rush home today to collect the stuff and then make my way over to golders green to meet my cousin who's got an exam tomorrow.  Well, at least it was warm and sunny and the tube wasn't packed either. Hm, maybe that's why they're going on strike - cos the weather's too good to be working underground etc.  When are they ever going to change the legislation or whatever to stop them going on strike ALL THE TIME?! Geez, this country is so backwards. We should all go on strike (by creating a  National Go On Strike Unless You Are a Train Driver Day ) and see how the train drivers like it.  Hm... no, we could just have a national holiday for canteen staff then train drivers wouldn't be able to take a long break that day... or a national holiday for toilet cleaners so drivers don;t spend ages on the bog and then maybe our trains won't be delayed 'due to a queue of trains ahead'...

      Alrighty, I'm  getting fitter  then!  I've been walking up them stairs at work for over a week now (I'm on the 5th floor) and sometimes, if I remember, I'll walk down at the end of the day too.  This morning though, I managed to walk to the 6th floor and I didn't even realise until i opened the door! Duh!

      This is just a short list, in no particular order, of things I think girls get obsessed with including me! Yeh, yeh, I know, I'm way too old to be calling myself a girl but you know what I mean! Anyways, the list:   Perfect jeans  I spent several months hunting!  and finally bought 2 pairs in 1 week. One is Meltin' Pot (don't know it's origins) and the other is from Zara.  I think Anita said there are some jeans from Brazil which are really good and give you fabulous legs.  And I just read that Zanuk jeans give you a nice arse, as spotted on Cameron Diaz (I love her!).  Guys don't generally have this obsession cos they wear their jeans fairly loose but maybe some of them should start doing us girls a favour by obsessing a little too!  This brings me on to...   Does my bum look big...  Um, I have to question this one.  If your bum is too big, wouldn't any other part of your body be big as well? Like your thighs?!  I wouldnt mind it big if it looked pert too!  I actually hate my arse cos it's flat.  There's just no way mine is sexy, even though someone once told me I got a sexy arse....  I mean, I know for a fact that I have a more obvious asset!  It's true that you should never tell a girl she has a big arse.  Even if you've got to lie, tell her it's sexy, and she will adore you!   Black trousers, black coat, black cardi, little black dress  These items are for when we want to look good without standing out or for when we are feeling fat! They are what I call the 'slimming staples' of our wardrobe and like the jeans, we usually have several... never too many!  They're versatile... but if made of cotton, tends to fade so we definately need loads!   Calorie and fat content  Maybe not all girls are calorie counting but most seem happpy to let you know how many calories and grams of fat there is in what you eat! I read somewhere though that people who are overweight tend to under estimate how many calories they have eaten, and those who are underweight tend to over estimate...interesting huh?  I'm OK at guessing but it doesn's stop me eating anything if it tastes good... my taste buds will not be fooled by low fat versions of anything!

      When does simply liking something become an obsession???  I think I have may have one...  OK, I'm not gonna argue with myself on whether or not I am obsessed! Let's assume I have some sort of obsession, or maybe several, ha! Why do I have them?!  Is it boredom, being out of touch with reality, lack of ambition / direction... ???!  Well, there's loads of stuff I wanna acheive or do... maybe too much but I'm doing them slowy I think! So I guess I'm not living in total fantasy... and I'm not that bored.. sometimes I am, not often though.  Maybe my obsessions aren't too unhealthy... they might affect my everyday thoughts but they don't stop me living a happy life, so I guess all's fine in the Vicky World...

      I like doing nothing on sundays. Not absolutley-nothing-nothing, but nothing-important-nothings! Like today, handwashed some clothes... still tidying my room... read some magazines, been snacking all day... got Britney's 'Everytime' on repeat.  I bought the album almost half a year ago but haven't really listened to it until she released this single! It's addictive...

       urlLink    Boudoir has 2 king size (or possibly bigger!) beds but it's all the different lychee cocktails which I like!  I recommend these 2 cocktails:  incognito  fresh mint, lime, lychees, vodka, apple juice  mexican passion  passionfruit, lime, tequila, chambord, orange, grenadine  I asked if I could work behind the bar! The manager gave me an application form despite laughing at me for having no experience whatsoever.  Now I've just got to find out if my contract with DB allows me to have another job...  Sing! Sing with me!   Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key. I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl. And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie. So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me. 'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin'

      How weird is it that I feel so down?!  After last night's Eng-Port game, I wanted to take a sickie and just stay home.  I heard some kid shout out the window: "Yeah, England's coming home, hahaa".  How much I wanted to punch him.....    I've decided to not eat Swiss chocolates... for a while... or unless someone else buys them! Stupid Swiss referee, why don't you go and work for Lindt instead.

      Didn't get much sleep the night before so I was really really tired yesterday.  Would have been nice if I could have gone home after work to sleep but no, I had to go all the way to Greenford, waited around a bit to arrange for the boiler to be fixed.  I fell asleep on the tube on the way there and also on the way back!  Stupidly, instead of going to bed early, I spent a while surfing the net last night, looking at food & restaurant related stuff....  I'd been emailing Fai all day about favourite foods!  Although we didn't talk about yummy donuts, I ended up on the Krispy Kreme web site and found that it's possible to fund raise by selling Krispy Kreme donuts.   This reminded me that we still need to raise money for the Dragon Boat race in July.  Well, I think I'm a bit too late in trying to arrange something with the catering manager at work and in trying to apply for the fund raising program with Krispy Kreme - I can't get hold of their advisor and applications must be made within 2 weeks....  Maybe I will just stick to eating their donuts.  In case you haven't tried them yet, I suggest that you make your way down to Harrods, and try a fresh hot  Original Glazed  AND another more fancy one such as the  cinnamon and apple filled  or the  chocolate iced custard filled  or the  Powdered Strawberry filled donut!!

      I kinda don't want to go to this boat race training on saturday.  It's going to be awkward for me.... having to see certain people.  Maybe I'll be aching from Go-Karting... and maybe I can get Ian to be my replacement.... maybe if I raise the whole sponsorship money instead of rowing, I won't feel that i'm letting Kee down...  Yes Fai, you warned me but it was too late by then!  Yes Dan, shit happens and it's how you deal with it..... and I don't know how to!  People, thanks for your advice / tips and putting up with my crazyness... but I'm still not sure what the frig to do.....

      Started off confused and tired this morning.  Since then, I've had a can of coke and a large tea and will prob need to maintain a constant level of caffeine in my body to stay alert....  I didn't remember that I start 8.30 today, until it was 8.30!  And there was me, taking my time to wash my hair and put on my make up.  I even used some gold glittery tint on my face (Boots No.7 range): it's gel-like and creates a very subtle sparkle.... So what if it's Monday morning and I'm putting glitter on my face!?  England are going to win and score at least 2 goals tonight so this is in prep for the celebrations!

      Should this be in my profile section?  The  Restaurant I could eat in everyday and not feel sick  award probably goes to Mayflower on Shaftsbury Av.  There's the usual 'chinese' dishes listed in the english menu.  Then there's a very long special menu, written in chinese!  Even then, you can always ask for variations in any of the dishes to suit your own taste.  I've never had a bad meal here which is probably why this restaurant has been around for as long as I can remember.... well over 20 years!  What do I like to eat in Mayflower?  Well, if I wasn't restricted by the size of my stomach, the meal would go something like this:  Steamed king scallops topped with fried garlic and vermicelli, plus a spring onion and fresh chilli soy sauce Iceberg lettuce wrap of mixed meat with hoisin sauce Lobster and noodles with ginger and spring onion Battered milk balls(!) with stir fry of asparagus, prawn and mango and a sugar dip (there are several versions of this and it's my favourite dish) I can't choose between aromatic pancake duck or aromatic duck with the yam on it Spiced honey pork cutlets Frogs legs deep fried with chilli salt (squid version is good too but as you can see above, there's already loads of seafood) Chinese broccolli with minced prawn 'Hang and fry' chicken plus this gunky creamy fermented sauce called 'lam yoo'  And just in case I'm still not satsifed: Toffee banana and vanilla ice cream Chilled red bean drink

      Quoting a manager from where I work: "My greatest lesson in life is if you are not enjoying something for any length of time, change. Don't let this become a way of life".  That seems like a very simple way of looking at it.  But what about also looking at why you are not enjoying something... then that would also help you to find something that you do enjoy.  Otherwise, you might end up changing it for something which is only a quick fix and which you might not enjoy in the long run.....

      I was just having a Kit Kat and thinking how much I liked opening the old style wrappers.  You know, removing the outer paper, sliding your nail down the crispy foil and releasing the milk chocolate wafer fingers with a snap!  Ah, the good old days!  Now we got the foil fresh wrapper which doesn't have the same therapeutic feel when you come to open it AND you can no longer tell that it's been sitting on the shop shelf for like 10 months 'cos of the new hi-tech wrapping..... Well, I should stop moaning really and just get use to it....  I don't think anyone wants to be eating mouldy Kit Kats anyway.

      Shit! Wha' happend?! Was outdoors around Hyde park for most of yesterday.  Now my left arm and left shoulder is darker than my right arm and right shoulder!  How stupid do I look?!  Could it be any worse? Well.... the left of my shins are darker than the right side of each shin.... and Dan reckons I'm gonna peel.  It's all his fault for wearing that white shirt and reflecting the sun on to my right side... =p  Good thing I had foundation on my face!  What was the most exciting thing I did yesterday?  From the guys' point of view, could it be me stripping off my vest to reveal myself in a bikini top? :D  Looked more like a bra, I think.  Never done that in a park before. Spent a good while contemplating though! I suppose it was nothing compared to Ian who was topless and blatantly revealing his Calvins...  Hang on!  I also drove down Knightsbridge and Park Lane and then Bayswater Rd. That was quite fun - loads of big bends.... I like it!  Hey, the road around Hyde Park is almost like a racing circuit, hee-hee, especially if you include Kensington Gardens to the east and then Green Park / St James's Park to the west - then it's like a figure of 8, with that round-about at Hyde Park Corner being the bit where the loops meet.  How comes I come up with such great ideas?!

      As I was logging on to update my blog to tell you about that V6 I spotted, I began to sing this song (obviously my brain was linking it to the title of my blog):   Big Big World .  Didn't get very far with it cos couldn't remember all the words.  Here they are though:  Emilia - Big big world  I'm a big big girl in a big big world It's not a big big thing If you leave me But I do do feel That I do do will Miss you much, miss you much  I can see the first leaf falling It's all yellow and nice It's so very cold outside Like the way I'm feeling inside  I'm a big big girl in a big big world It's not a big big thing If you leave me But I do do feel That I do do will Miss you much, miss you much  Outside it's now raining And tears are falling from my eyes Why did it all have to happen Why did it all have to end  I'm a big big girl in a big big world It's not a big big thing If you leave me But I do do feel That I do do will Miss you much, miss you much  I have your arms around me Ooooh like fire But when I open my eyes You're gone  I'm a big big girl in a big big world It's not a big big thing If you leave me But I do do feel That I do do will Miss you much, miss you much  I'm a big big girl in a big big world It's not a big big thing If you leave me But I do do feel That I do do will Miss you much, miss you much

      Hello World! Driving lesson #14. Guess which car I saw during my lesson?! That Clio Renaultsport V6... It's the first time I've seen that car on the road.  I was parked outside the driving school on Rosebury Avenue and preventing my instructor from doing his toilet business cos I was soooo excited at spotting the car! I made him sit in the car whilst I waved frantically at the Clio driver, trying hard to get his attention.  The driver didn't see me. :(  Anyway, it's gorgeous, apart from the grey side vents which are a little OTT... Maybe they shouldn't have made them grey.

You think we both wild Lis'? ;)  Actually, Lisa's much more sure of herself than I am of myself.... but we both like to have fun!  Missing you Cupcake! xx

      So now I'm a bloke?! - I know more about cars than Dan!  This is what my future Civic Type R can basically do: 0-62mph in 6.6 secs with top speed (which I had to go back to the website to find) of 146mph.  That's all I really care about.... Oh, and there's the sound of the engine which I have to tell you about another time.  As for Dan's, well he has just confessed.  He says, "tell u the truth, i dont even know the specs". Some minutes later (he's prob has just grabbed the car brochure), he adds - "its abt 5-6 sec car....280 bhp , 0-60 in 5.5 , top speed... let me find ouf".  Off he goes, again? Then about 100 years later, Dan returns to tell me "152".  I think i could have bought, driven and sold my Civic Type R in the time he's taken to get all that info to me.... So, I'm sorry Dan, my baby wins tonite!  Must think of a name for her.... or do I call my car a 'him'?  Someone please tell me!  Good night from Vroooom! (that's me) and Good night from Shhhh! (that's Dan)

      I've known all along that I can't read.  I've been carrying  The Surgeon  by Tess Gerritsen for 2 days now and all I've managed to read is the back cover plus the flippin prologue!  There's some psychological barrier that prevents me from concentrating for long periods when I know there's more than a couple of pages to read :(  I bet there's a medical term for it like  libriphobia  or something...  Actually, I might be doing quite well compared with my attempt to read Fyodor Dostoevsky's  Crime and Punishment , which took me like 5 years... to only read 30 or so pages of the book!  Kwok, I don't know how you managed to finish it.    So what did I do instead? Listen to music - just my usual compilation of pop-R&B.  My favourite at the moment is Trick Me, Kelis.  How funky is that?!  Fuck It and F U Right Back both have quite a catchy tune! :)   My excuse for not reading? There's simply not enough room on the Tube for all the commuters AND their reading material - books, mags, and worst of all, broadsheets...  Also, music makes me feel good and that can only be a good thing when you are sardined on the Tube during rush hour.  You know there's a scientific basis too.  Maybe you've heard of music therapy?!  And to quote journal research by a chink called Patrick Chiu - "Confucius, Plato, and Pythagoras believed that daily exposure to music would enhance one’s health".  So there you go!  *singing* There you go, lookin pitiful Just because I let you go There you go, talkin bout you want me back But sometimes it be's like that...

      Wow, I finally get to lie in on a saturday. Got up almost 1pm. Went to bed quite late last night because I went to Epping Forest in the middle of the night to, um,  catch ghosts .  I won't embarrass the people whose idea it was by naming them.  They've done it a few times and have never seen any ghosts there.  Dumb shits! I did find the cemetary and the shadows spooky but that was about it.

My plan for tomorrow: 1. Drink coffee so I stay awake / alert (going slow makes me fall asleep) 2. Snack but not too big a meal (that can put me to sleep too) 3. and ummmmmmm, not to rush anything  oh, and I'm not planning to show my legs or flash parts of me at the examiner... well, not unless I've made some major fault!

Maybe Victor is right and I'm really looking forward to my driving test?!  I don't think I've ever looked forward to any test or exam before!  I suppose driving test is different - I actually enjoy my driving lessons, whereas with subjects like finance, the lessons put me to sleep.  I am a bit nervous cos I've still not done an emergency stop.  Some people say it's piss easy but some say it's not.  I'll soon find out myself.

      Not much to say. I could sum up the week but then the week ain't over yet...  Do I have any opinions on anything...Let's see...  Nationwide congestion charge - taxed per mile driven and only a 'maybe reduction' on petrol duty.  Overall, governtment's revenue would go up. Well, it's not like I'd be driving much even if i got a car, but still, I hate tax of any sort and was peed to read this (on someone else's Metro!).  Don't they already recieve like 15p or somthing per litre?  They say they want to improve traffic flow, oh yeh right.... they're just trying to balance their books!  Prob won't be spending more to improve public transport because they reckon that it wont take many of the drivers off the road.... Sort it out!  Did I also read possible higher rate stamp duty on property or was it higher council tax on expensive properties?  I'm almost feeling sorry for the rich who actually work hard for their money....

      I'm almost 8 stones! Shocking! Well, I'm not surprised really....  I've eaten loads of junk and desserts and shit. My appetite has increased recently.  Not sure how. Normally, I can't physically eat much, not even when I'm hungry.  I've now developed this little tummy and I keep stroking it, hahaha!

      I just broke my pink sunglasses.  Was trying to avoid having to go shopping cos i'm quite skint this month but I really need a pair when I drive cos the glare gives me headache.  Have just paid for my trip to LV, will have to pay several hundred for the driving lessons (maybe they've forgotten!), and might be booking my trip to Oz soon too.  Anyways, I do remember seeing a cheap pair in Nine West couple months back.  They should be even cheaper if they are in the sale...

      It's been tough trying to stay awake today.  My work took me much longer because I couldn't think - my mind was drifting into that nothingness state.  I think I'm suffering from  weekend jetlag .  I could fall asleep with my face on the keyboard right now.  Will be fine tomorrow.

      Shake it like a polaroid picture!  &nbsp;  Good morning my dear loyal fans.&nbsp; Thank you for logging on and coming straight to my blog... you sad f*cks!&nbsp; Joke, joke!&nbsp; I sound like I'm still drunk from last night?&nbsp; Nah, I'm fine.&nbsp; No hangover either.  &nbsp;  The evening started off with me missing the&nbsp;kebabs.... but weren't gonna let that ruin the rest&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;night.&nbsp; How many chinks were there at Steam bar?!&nbsp; A hundred?&nbsp; Shame they were all so short.&nbsp; And thanks to Gav, I ended up stuck with a GEORGE for a good 15 minutes... that's 15 minutes too long if you ask me!&nbsp; He wanted to dance.. and for some strange&nbsp; reason (!) I wanted to sit. &nbsp;I am single, people, S-I-N-G-L-E...&nbsp; not desperate and I don't go for&nbsp;money, unless he's got a pretty car, got it?!  &nbsp;  Poor Tony - we got him&nbsp;a whole rainbow of shooters...&nbsp; some of them tasted good though!&nbsp; He was still able to walk unaided at the end of the night.&nbsp; Pretty good stuff!&nbsp;

      Roxanne Clark, The Times -   " GREEN  Feeling stressed? If you can’t escape to the countryside, find a patch of green to sit on. It’s nature’s colour to calm frayed and exhausted nerves....  BLUE  Too much on your mind? Go outside and look up at the sky. Blue is the colour of peace, tranquillity and reflection.... Like the sky, blue creates a sensation of space..."  Ah! Now I know why I love my blue and green bedroom so much!  What else does she say?  " PINK  Need a little loving?…Pink, the most feminine colour, represents love, clarity and calm, and is effective in soothing emotional upheavals..."  I like pink in general... Does it mean I am a feminine, loving and calm person or does it mean I'm not any of these things so that I end up collecting things in pink?!

      When my brother finds out, he's going to have a go at me.... that I said no to promotion.  I'm not in the mood to be managing everyone elses' workload. Nor am I in the right state of mind to be getting myself involved in office politics.  I'm not getting into that. I can see myself getting pissed off with certain people if I do.  Maybe in a few months time, things will change and I will be motivated again?!  Then again, maybe when that time comes, I would have missed the opportunity??  Anyways, if I had said yes, they wouldn't have paid me any more until begining of next year.  Why would I want to stress myself for the peanuts which they feed me with?  I'm not unhappy in my job. But it's not fun anymore either.  I just get my work done and that is it.  It's simple and it suits me fine... for now!

      This award goes to Mr Polam Lee & Miss Kim Chan  I'm not saying they're an odd couple. I'm saying these 2 are so funny together.  They've made me laugh so much over the past few weeks..... possibly at the expense of Phil?? Oops! Anyways, thank you for making me laugh, whether intentional or not...  Maybe it's just me being mad :D

      I had a double lesson before midday and drove up to north london. Wasn't much traffic so felt like a nice drive there and back.  At one point I was trying to imagine what it'd be like driving the Civic Type R!! Dual carraigeways are more fun in Barry's fiesta than Dan's Micra... wont go into why that is! I can't wait to pass my test and go for some test drives...  I've already decided to do it in Slough where there's loads of car showrooms and them long bendy roads!  I think Phil and Po and going to test out some decent cars too. Can't wait!  Oh, the bendy roads in Hampstead are also good fun!  I don't really know the roads around there but Barry always tells me where I need to go and warns me of any hazards so I just have to concentrate on driving!  Is that a bit like rally driving?!  Must try that one day!  I'm not totally confident I'll pass first time.  I still don't use my mirrors enough and I seem to disagree with my instructor on how cautious I need to be...

      Wowsers! It's really pouring down right now.  Good thing I'm indoors... Actually, I don't really mind the rain so long as I'm not wearing white trousers or expensive shoes.... Also, I like the sound of heavy rain when I go to sleep - cosy to be tucked up warm and dry plus the noise is kind of soothing!  Maybe my brain associates heavy rain with being on holiday??! Most the times I've gone Hong Kong is during the summer monsoon season.  So even though it pisses down, it's warm and you can still go out in your flip flops, splash about in the puddles and not worry about soggy feet!!

       Man it was absolutely awesome!!  The crowds were great, really lively and a brilliant atmosphere.  The streets were busy and full of F1 fans thinking they were spiderman and climbing up buildings scaffolding etc.  I was down Haymarket as well were the cars were starting from and just about managed to glimpse the tops of the cars as they went by.  But the noise.... OMG... the noise these cars makes was awesome!  At first when I got there there were some pretty impressive exhaust notes already, but these turned out to be just the pace cars.  When the F1 cars started their engines you knew about it!  Even though they were about 200m away, it felt like they were revving away right on top of me!  And then when they went past......  HOLY COW!  As one guy put it "I think I've just come".  It wasn't an engine making that noise, somehow they have bottled thunder and harnessed it to power these machines and boy, is that thunder ever pissed off!  Really glad I went because I'll never get to hear an F1 engine being revved like that again so close to me.  They were doing the wheelspins close to where I standing and I swear the were hitting their 17,000 rpm limiters. Actually the noise is like a giant electric drill magnified a thousand times laced with a bit of thunder and topped off with a bit of petrol.   Kee Law is demanding commission for this! Now let me explain why I've posted his email. I think it's good description... pretty much  described my feelings ....there's similarities to what I experienced probably becos i was at Haymarket too (Eros end) and I spotted people climbing the Clydsdale Bank building opposite and said to Kim - "they think they're spiderman?!"  How freaky Kee! Also, it's how he described the F1 cars as if they were living.  At the time, I was thinking they sounded like living creatures too!  Couldnt pinpoint which until Kim said 'elephant'!  So yeh, they sounded like elephants going beserk but amplified... and since the noise is, ahem, a turn on, I can imagine elephants making these noises when fighting over a mate or something!  As for the bloke that Kee quoted.... well, that just reminded me of the time I was in the Civic Type R.  Since then, any sound of revving has this funny effect on me ;)  Also, I could swear that for the rest of last night, cars, vans and motorbikes were revving everywhere I went....

      Tried to pay again last night but they wouldnt let me!  They said I had to arrange via the team who took my booking. How dumb?  So I called this morning before 9am and now it's lunch time and the payment still hasn't gone through!  I'm only sticking with Ebookers becos they seem to be the only travel agent who can get me from Bangkok to Sydney on the cheaper fare, everyone else says it is not available and i would have to pay £100 more.  I'm not paying that much more to go via Bangkok for 2 nights!  Anyways, I am definately going Oz! Maybe via KL or TKY or HK instead?!  I am practising hard with my swimming... sort of!  Well, I'm trying to get use to swimming (that's like 10 metres!) with my head in the water but my ears don't like it!  I sounded like i had ear wax moving inside my ear all last night and this morning... it's kinda gone now!

      How bloody long have I spent on the phone sorting out a very simple set of flights? Well, not too sure how long, but about 10 calls later, and it's still not booked, hahaha!    I called and spoke to Jimmy yesterday to get a quote.  Then decided after work that I should hold them and spoke to a Luke.    Today, I called Luke 3 times, each time he said he'd call me back after a few minutes but he didn't.  So i gave up with him and called up and spoke to Sagna, she was no help, so i tried Jimmy again and he'd given me the wrong extension number and ended up speaking to some girl (didnt catch her name) who said Jimmy was busy with someone.    Then Luke DID call me back, woohoo! but then he said he had to go away and call me back later... boohoo..... Eventually, he called back then I realised I'd ordered a replacement card cos it'd been damaged but tried it anyway....  Only to get another call back to say it had been declined..... I can't use anyone else's card cos i'm getting an e-ticket!  Could this get any more stupid??

      Stepping out of the cool air-conditioned car, and into the bloody hot humid and smelly air, just reminds me of being on holiday.. in Hong Kong.  Today must be the hottest day of the year so far or at least the hottest evening of the year so far cos I am feeling uncomfortably sticky in my room right now.    Dreading having to do another full week at work.  I feel quite sick of working.  It doesn't help that I'm looking at holiday brochures and stuff. Can't wait for my day off next week when I'm going Alton Towers.  Will be staying in a caravan... for the first time!  Should be loads of fun.

      As I Mature I've learned that you cannot make someone love you.  All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.   I've learned that no matter how much I care,  some people are just assholes.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust,  and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.   I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes.  After that, you'd better have a big willy or huge boobs.   I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others -  they are more screwed up than you think.   I've learned that you can keep vomiting  long after you think you're finished.   I've learned that we are responsible for what we do,  unless we are celebrities.   I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first,  the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!   I've learned that the people you care most about in life  are taken from you too soon  and all the less important ones just never go away.

      Trade downloads were buggered today, and yesterday, and the day before.  Coincidently, haven't updated my blog since going to work on Monday!  Maybe it's stressing me out without me realising?  Makes my work more manual than it already is but it's the fact that they still not fixed it which annoys me most.   I'm going to take a nap now and hopefully wake up to dinner!
