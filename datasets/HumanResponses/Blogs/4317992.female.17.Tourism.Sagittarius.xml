       It’s another lonely night without you by my side. Another year has come, another night, another year of wishful thinking. No matter how much I deny it, I still get lonely at times. Especially at nights, with saccharine music playing on my quiet room. It’s already late and yet I’m still wide-awake. I know I need to sleep coz tomorrow’s another school day. But I can’t. Thoughts of you came rushing on my mind. Damn! I’ve been longing for you for God knows how long. All my nights have been spent thinking of how, when and where in this world could we possibly meet. Would our first meeting be as magical as fairy tales? Or is it as romantic as movies? What would our story be? Would we be the love-hate kind or would we be the best of friends, slowly finding they falling for one another? How would you look like? Would you be someone like those basketball players I keep gushing on? Or would you be a singer, singing songs of love for me? Maybe you’re a college scholar, someone my mother would surely want to be a son-in- law. Perhaps you would be just a simple guy, but with more love than those I had wished to have. But whatever you may be, whoever you are, what would matter is that you would love me, put me on a pedestal and help me be the best that I can be. And I would love you too. Giving you back all the love you would bestow me. Our story would be the best one could ever have, more magical than fairy tales, more romantic than movies. I would treasure you and thank you for being someone worth my long wait. You would be the reason for my being and my inspiration to get through this journey called life. And I will kiss you, tenderly and sweetly. I’ll softly whisper my words of thanks to you. For coming to my life just when I need you most. You’ll kiss me back and tell me you love me, so much greater that you thought you could ever love. And we’ll pray together. I would thank Him for teaching me to be patient, for making me believe that He has the best plans for us. And you would thank Him too for giving you an angel in the form of a human. And I would smile; give you this letter I had written some years before I met you. You would think I’m crazy. But I’d say it is faith that enabled me to write this. It’s my belief that one-day; I too would fall in love. I would love someone and that someone would love me too. And that someone is you. I know I would love you even before I met you. I don’t know when and where I could find you. But in due time, we’ll gonna meet. And all we have to do today is work on our own lives. Someday, in His time, and in our own perfect time, I know I will have you. Someday I will love you. Someday I’m gonna love you. And that someday would be the star of forever.  Till our paths cross.

         Well, this is the beginning of my hopefully daily blog.      I'll post what's happening in my "oh so crazy" life. Most likely half of the stuff won't make sense if you don't know where I'm coming from, but I hope you find something to enjoy.
