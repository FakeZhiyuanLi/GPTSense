      Well well weeell.....love fridays, they always put me in da mood to play and pArty...and the thought that the next day is the start of the weekend makes it ever more so delightful!   To kickstart this entry, FS was fun today, did basic Set Theory...its a nice feeling to have when u know how to do everthing...mwahahahahahaha. PSP1 was well...less entertaining...i am getting left behind in Java...guess i will try to get back on track after the violin exam which is not too far away...  Played CS with marianne, andrew, zaki, samuel and guohua aka Tearing Face...reduced gravity until we were flying around Matrix style...pretty amusing when we were flying around trying to knife each other to death!! Things got funnier when tiek hee joined in..soon we were firing off dual pistols Matrix style...with the flying effects and all! But what really cracked us up was when andrew and i, being Ct's, ganged up on tiek hee by&nbsp;we two flying sideways in opposite directions while firing&nbsp;away...it was  seriously  like a scene out of The Matrix...&nbsp;  Took a nap when i reached home..dont know why, but i was dead beat when i was in 154....i was seriously soused out man....and i dont think i really strained my eyes or anything....  Violin accompaniment went better than the previous two sessions...felt like i was becoming more used to the piano accompaniment..though intonation is still quite, quite bad......haiz....  Collected my new spec frames...then went home...let mei listen to Jay Chou's new single..then packed up and headed for yuhua. What else can you expect when u put the grads together in a bus?  Utter, Total,  MADNESS.   Got Shehui screaming when i let her listen to the new single by Jay....haha  Man...a thousand four hundred strong combined school chinese orchestra, further strengthened by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, it was a dream come true...many people find it funny that due to my very, very strong preference to English songs and given my violin musical background, its queer that i am a sucker too for chinese orchestral music...what can i say man...i am just going back to my roots yea? Oh yeeea....anyway back to the concert, could see it was a huge major event, with people like DPM Lee himself gracing the event! Music got me grooving...though i felt that in one particular movement, the special computer sound effects kinda spoilt the authentic oriental feeling that sends me reeling into ecstasy..well thats exaggerating a bit but hey, you get the idea....  Had supper at samuel's auntie's place again...and all i wanted was a Henny's! Shared a bottle with good ole george treatin me...wahahaha one fine day i will treat him to a pint of Erdinger...now  that  is&nbsp;one beer that you&nbsp;will never ever&nbsp;get in the coffeeshops yea?  Yea chatted a while until we hit 11.45, then we had to start heading for home...Ys and sam ever wary of my beer-induced rambling...especially when we were in the taxi..haha hey u gotta admit, its kinda fun to mislead the taxi driver.....yes? LOL  Thats all then...took a bath to quickly get rid of the alcohol fumes before dad or mum found out...and yeap, here i am now, blogging...yeap think thats all...need to hit the hay...wanna be in yuhua by nine tomorrow so yea, later people.

      Oh yay, i have finally got the hang of the whole binary and hexadecimal arithmethic thing....though it comes with a price...this whole conversion thing screws around with my brain pretty badly. Just imagine, i took two bloody minutes to subtract 178 from 207! And to make matters worst, i wasnt so sure my answer was correct so i had to covertly check with the computer calculator....goodness.....what a nightmare...  Well yeah anyway, seems like gunbound is acting like a sort of medium to get to know my classmates better, yea i stopped playing gb seriously a long time ago but hey, if it works to my social advantage, why not? And i still do get a slight satisfying feeling when i blast someone to oblivion...in a  sadistic  sort of way...mwahahahahaha  Think from now on i will upload a picture to grace this so very dead blog...yea think i will do just that...and i still dont know whats wrong with the music code...argh screw it.  Gotta go back to yuhua tomorrow morning...gonna pay a visit to both mrs sunil and mdm peng for 2 testimonials...god, i dont know how long it has been since i first requested for my testimonial to be done? *yAWn*  Yeah thats about then..pretty boring blog entry..but hey as i said before, its not like a lot of ppl bother to read this thing so well...yea, don't really give a shit, haha.   Later people.

      Dang, its been four days since i last blogged....erm, how's been&nbsp;busy with CM sound to you? Wahahaha, yea been slacking all&nbsp;the way..and oh my goodness, just realized that i have already spent about a month in ngee ann...and i still feel like some dumb freshie! Seriously,&nbsp;i have been&nbsp;slacking way too much...couldnt&nbsp;do shit for PSP1, and now we are gonna start GUI, i am seriously in deep, deep  shit.    Ah anyway, yeah back to the title's meaning, big cousin Jasmine has finally come home! Its been three long years since she left for the UK to study in the University Of Warwick. And well, bit sad really that she's home now., For her of course, and for me. Why for me? Haha, cause there goes my yearly supply of Wrigley's and Rowntree's gums( In case you are wondering, Wrigley's is&nbsp;a brand of chewing gum and Rowntree is the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;equivalent of Frutips) .   Dad too just came home from his business trip to Vietnam...dang, didnt bring&nbsp;any pirated stuff except for one very lousy Spiderman2 dvd. What he did&nbsp;buy back though, was two very&nbsp;nice adidas shirts, imitations of course! But hey, they look sweeeeeet.......whats worrying is that he's kinda ill...and he worked&nbsp;late...thats somethin i have not seen in years...sentiments echoed by my big sis.&nbsp;   Now back to my day..er, kinda hectic today...ran around ngee ann trying to get NFSP:Underground for waimun..think i pissed Linsing off a bit with my consistent pestering..so sorry there mate...  Went straight home, did the violin until it was time for the piano accompaniment class which went well, slightly better than the first one but still, it was mostly a bloody disaster..especially screwing up on the octave double stops again for Dvorak and also couldnt get my timing right for the Fantasia piece...oh well..i am gonna screw up grade 6, just like i did for grade 5..oh man oh maaaaan.....   Went straight down to harmonica...testimonial once more denied...seriously, i dont get it, must i be PRESENT when a mdm peng does the testimonial? Isnt a testimonial supposed to be done alone where she can gather her thoughts in private? Yea? Argh dont know la....   Followed the usual crowd to Jp..and blew 2.80 for bubble tea...haha decided to try it after not drinking bubble tea for like almost wat, 1 and a half years? And er, after finishing the thing, i swear i will not waste money like that ever again. LOL.&nbsp; Continued walking around until surprise surprise, ran into jintang and kelvin at pastamania. Sat down and chatted about all kinds of crap and life in SP. After seperating, walked again until we ran into chinhong..funny, lucky to have ran into 3 classmates of mine..sadly all in SP... :(   Nothing much after that, went home, had dinner, and blah blah blah, played gb for a while with the usual ppl...was slightly amused at sylvia's many attempts to shoot me..ah well, cant really laugh..she's still a noob after all...uh, yea..spent most of the time lookin at cs skins..its all that andrew's fault, got me hooked onto downloading the skins.   And surprisingly, thats friday for me...weekend upon me once again...need no prediction that i am gonna slack through again..wahaha. Thats about it then, since dad is home now, cant afford to stay up too late or things will start flying around...lol.Oh yea, something's wrong with the music code, mei having the same problem too, oh well, life's a bitch yea?   Later people.

       Goodness, the bloody weekend has passed by so quickly....too damn quickly i guess, crap, there goes another weekend and i have yet to revise my java and binary stuff..oh maaaaan i cant believe i just slacked off...oh bugger....    &nbsp;  Think i could be excused for saturday...had a soccer match in the morning, then lugged my bloody tired legs back&nbsp;to&nbsp;school in&nbsp;hiiigh hopes&nbsp;of getting the testimonial&nbsp;from mdm&nbsp;peng but well,&nbsp;she seemed to be busying herself with all the charity stuff and celebrating bo yea's bday and all and well...i really couldnt bring myself to remind her about the reason&nbsp;why i appeared in school&nbsp;not really to help out for harmonica but really to take the testimonial..oh well...life's&nbsp;shit.  &nbsp; Hauled my tired ass home, bathed, ate&nbsp;lunch and then rushed&nbsp;for&nbsp;violin class that stretched from 3.30 all the way&nbsp;to 5.15 pm. Totally screwed up on my first accompaniment session, despite a&nbsp;having grade 5 experience, i still go nervous on the fingers, which of&nbsp;course,&nbsp;costs&nbsp;me heavily on intonation...i definitely made Dvoral turn in his grave when i totally screwed up on the octave double stops not once but  TWICE!  By the time i got home after passing jiahui the suzuki cd's, i was dead beat and fell dead on my bed until 10pm. &nbsp; And on sunday, well, i seriously relaxed the whole day...got up at 11am..had a lazy brunch...read the papers...then went to practice on the violin for about 2 hours then played warcraft till about 3.30? Changed and went to meet jiancong at clementi mrt but surprise surprise, sarah and yewon were late in getting to clementi...their reason being a very indecisive linsing who didnt wanna go out at the last minute, haha no worries there.... :) &nbsp; Went down to bugis first to see Mr Teng perform with&nbsp; a couple of well, middle aged NUS students...and er, i was seriously tickled by Mr Teng's&nbsp; very,&nbsp;very obvious&nbsp;pot belly  but hey, at&nbsp;least it doesn't spill over&nbsp;his belt like some FS teacher that i know.......LOL. Oh yea, rushed down to the botanic gardens to watch&nbsp;the band fiesta like we&nbsp;do every year...goodness, i&nbsp;dont know of any other&nbsp;batch of harmonica people&nbsp;who have supported the band so fervently like we have....but hey, i dont know about the rest but i have always been a fan of band music,&nbsp;especially that godly saxaphone that never fails to get me in&nbsp;da groove baby... &nbsp; Was amusing to see leslie, sanjay and rizal dancing away...no offense rizal, but u&nbsp;were entertaining&nbsp;not in the sense&nbsp;of your dancing skills but rather&nbsp;erm, your  valiant  attempts in  TRYING  to dance, wahahaha hey practice makes perfect yea?&nbsp; &nbsp; Had dinner at Clementi...then went home....showered...and was absolutely delighted at&nbsp;the sight of three beautiful tubes of Rowntree fruitgums!!&nbsp;Huge thanks to Ahyi for that favour!! And after that,&nbsp;was lights out. &nbsp; And FINALLY, today, monday, i being the fool, thought class started at 9a, when it was actually a workshop..and for ONCE, i could not enter 154! And it was a bloody double decker bus! Luckily a guy told me that there was another one&nbsp;right behind...and&nbsp;sarah smsed&nbsp;her sympathy...lol &nbsp; Think i finally got the hang of the binary thing..and now its worse&nbsp;with the hexadecimal thingy? And now i am expected&nbsp;to use SHORTCUTS in the conversion...man....i hate all kinds of math, or arithematic or whatsoever. &nbsp; IMMF, well, fell asleep as usual..missed out on&nbsp;some&nbsp;of the important CSS stuff...i should really kill myself&nbsp;for that..now i have to go to MEL to&nbsp;see the powerpoint thing. Practical went better,&nbsp;and its really amusing to see Mr Vic Liang trying to swear silently? But well,&nbsp;his&nbsp;aussie accent really does make it quite, quite audible...yea. Amusing indeed. &nbsp; Rest&nbsp;of the day is pretty much the same, send zaki home, go home, eat, play, review work, talk on msn, yea&nbsp;and now blogging&nbsp;...wowee think this is my longest blog yet...wahahaha yea guess thats all then,&nbsp;and oh man, tomorrow's&nbsp;I.S day...IAC and WAA, here we come...oh well, later people.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Ok i think my blogging habits have lasped into some kinda habit, blog between 10.30 to 2am, and now i wait for 2 days to pass before i add a new entry...hey not like anyone really cares yea? Anyway, relieved that i FINALLY received my reprint of the school's leaving cert...oh  yessss ....Was kinda amused to see the Big P of the school going around wearing a blue cap, grinning away and asking students how they liked his er..hat. Hey its always better to have&nbsp; a loony principal than some dry old fart.  &nbsp; And todaay? Today was the best day i have ever had for mytimetable, classes ended at 12! Oh yea,&nbsp; blissful relaxation all the waaay....turned down george's invitation to go catch Brotherhood..was feeling lazy...had lunch in canteen 3 with me big sis and some of the guys from class. Hah, Ericia and her friend thought my sis was my gf! Dang, does she look THAT young....nah i think its because she's rather shoooort...wahahahahahaha &nbsp; Kinda wasted my whole afternoon, played warcraft3, then went on to a few rounds of cs...god have i lost touch of that game...i was seriously a free frag for the bots during the first few matches. Oh yea, blasted the whole house with my Sprite Hip Hop compilation, finally got to make full use of me 5.1 speaker system, bass absolutely rocks! &nbsp;Spent about an hour bobbing to the music of Obie Trice while tacking my newly bought posters..goodness, three posters for 24 freakin bucks!! Oh well.... guess nothing really significant left to say..post ends here i guess, really gotta go practice violin...seriously screwing up every sat...god help me.... &nbsp; Later people

      Oh yes....2 bloody days of utter boredom......goodness, monday and tuesday were like, how do i put it...BORING. Nothing fun happened on monday...only just the discovery that people do nothing but relax during workshops...very amusingly  opposite  to what the workshops are meant for....but hey i aint complaining.... And oh yea, samuel surprises me more and more with his er, behaviour in class....crazy guy just calmly watched his Spiderman 2 dvd during the tutorial, wahahahaha at least he provides some crazy in-class entertainment.. :p  And tuesday? Slept all the way till 12pm (SSSSssssh dont tell mum!) had a lazy brunch...read the papers....yAwn... Finally tried out the hair gel my sister gave to me...well...its not really gel..its more of er...brown goo or AKA bottle of shit/mud. But hey, its a goldwell product so i aint complainin..but OH MAN did that  "thing" stink  the whole bloody toilet!   Went to yuhua first in hopes of gettint the reprint of the leavin school cert but surprise surprise, mr ong being the bloody bugger with his inexhaustible supply of arrogance denying me once again...oh well...life's a bitch...  WAA class...heh, whole class was treated to periodic debates between a student and the teacher...talk about class involvement! This guy spoke his mind waaay to freely...but hey, better to be outspoken then some timid introvert yea?   And after class, went back to yuhua together with Ls to see our deear old yhhb and mdm peng...got blasted by mdm peng due to my earring...haha. And after that, is blah blah blah, played wc3 till 1 plus am...and now i am blogging about 2 days of my life that well, =  BORING . Oops nick just woke up, think lenny kravitz is singin a wee little too loud...ah heck who cares...later people.

      Woke up at 11am today, luckily mum wasnt around to give me a piece of her mind as she normally does every sunday lol. Had two miserable 'pao's for breakfast, watched nick play spiderman 2 for a while before i headed up back upstairs to play C&C Generals to fight for wateva cause the GLA are fighting for....er...played till about 1pm? Went downstairs to the kitchen to look at poor darrell trying his darnest to roll the dough nicely into an er, acceptable circular shape...BUT of course he miserably failed.....wahahaha. Thanks to his super built strong arms, he succeeded in making the pizza crust super thin, therefore unable to hold the pizza's toppings...some of the family blamed it on me because i did not spread enough cheese around the pizza but hey, at least the cheese HELD the pineapples and stuff TOGETHER! LOL wateva, anyway, was forced to do all the bloody dishes..yea, they happily splatter the spaghetti sauce all over their plates and i have to be the one who has to clean their shit up....wahahaha just kiddin guys....just havin fun bitchin about HOW BLOODY UNFAIR LIFE CAAAAAN BEEEEEEE.....BOOHOOOOO......lol lame.   Was on the last of the dishes when Sarah & Co. arrived, dont know why but it amused sarah and michelle when they saw me washin the dishes...*shrugs*   Oh well, had to convert the music scores to numbers much to yongxing's horror, as well, sarah, michelle and me were too used to looking at harmonica scores done taiwanese style...well that took quite a while to get the notes translated and then off we were practisin the song to a very, very confusing 3/4 beat..bad enough that we really couldnt get the beat, but to make things worse, yongxing's demostrations had him speeding like some mad cow on the loose...all thanks to the Allegro tempo indicated on the score sheet.  Managed to get the hang of the first two bars before sarah, michelle, yewon, larry and linsing groaned that they were starvin so they all happily took a break to go cook a huge pot of instant noodles...and guess who had to clean up? Haha nah sarah and michelle did most of the cleaning this time but er well, i only succeeded in failing TERRIBLY in trying to throw away the food scraps left in the sink...much to sarah's and michelle's amusement and LUCKILY mum didnt kick up a fuss at the mess i made...  Yea more training followed after that, our dear yeongsheng joined us later at around 5, yea he struggled too with the funny rhythem and the 3/4 timing. And being the bloody clown he so naturally is, he played around with the notes until he added more notes and voila, he played 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' and WAIT, it GOT BETTER, we all joined in and voila, out came the tune of HAPPY TREE FRIENDS!! LA LA LALALA........  After more training with yongxing on the piano, guys decided to order pizza delivery...goodness did they regret that later...Ls placed the order at around 7.10pm? And well, thanks to an 'apperently' busy day, the bloody brilliant pizza guys only reached at around 8.40pm...oh yea...and no cash rebate...oh well...as i always say, life's a bitch so no point bitching about life's unfairness eh? And oh man, before they started eating, my cousin nick had this bloody brilliant brain wave to come running up to me and telling me loudly that i had not bathed yet.......well done nick, nice that u brought up my personal hygeine affairs in front of a crowd of famished people...wat a great way to start a late dinner eh?   Well nothin significant happened after dinner...just the packing up and the usual walk to the bus stop to send the peeps off...er...came home and bathed...finished up wateva hw i had...will decide with the guys tomorrow about the FS hw we received in the mail...so yea, guess will stop here, nick snoring contentedly behind me...and yea gotta sleep too, class starts at nine tomorrow and oh YES, its Benson's bday tomorrow..well, since its 12 plus now, happy bday benson!! And its nice to hear the thunder rumblin in the background...looks like its gonna be a nice night to sleep.....oh yeeeeeea....later people.

      Uh oh, guess little sis was right, i DID forget to blog for er, one or two days? Oh weell, nevermind, not like anything THAT interesting happened anyway. Now lemme see wat happened on friday...uh...had classes as usual...was nodding away AS usual..haha. Decided to skip the ICT variety show together with samuel and sookjai, all of us happily decided that the show was a complete waste of time and that we could be at home doing somethin more productive like erm...sharpening our c&c generals skills.... ;P   And today? well, original plan was to go for the morning harmonica session so that i could take my testimonial from mdm peng but surprise surprise, found out that mdm peng would only be around for the afternoon session...oh well, my beauty sleep disrupted for nothing...lol. Lied to the nice SBS uncle that i was a still a secondary student so that i could pay only 60 cents in cash WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Er, violin went ok as usual, just shocked at the sudden change of tone, should not depend too much on the violin mute thing, makes my already pathetic tone recognition skills a lot more worse...screwed up on my first try at Allegro. Saw the original book which contained Dvorak's piano and violin pieces..goodness, the cover looks so nice, yet the pieces look so bloody cheem..haha  Rushed down to harmonica after violin in hopes of catchin mdm peng but OH man, my dear mdm peng did not do it...oh well, can't blame her anyway, she was really busy this week and she did seem sincerly apologetic about it, but hey, no worries there mdm peng! Gives me more time to write the Intent letter thing...not like i really wanna do it anyway...hahahaha.   Er bascially thats the whole two days ridicously compressed into 2 teeny weeny paragraphs...night still young, shehui and george slamming each other online on msn AS usual...so yea, thats all i guess, later people.

      Goodness, after so many months of scolding my sister for using the pc to do stupid things like BLOGGING, cant believe that i decided to start one up myself....so erm, yea, writing this at lemme see, 12.45 am, squinting in the darkness of my room while my nice cousin snores happily and rather disgustingly behind me...LOL. Er so well guess this will be my first post...need to catch some shuteye, have math class at 9am later...dumb statistics..so well, later people.

      Felt the urge to blog today, ah well here we go.  Woke up at around 10 a.m, dragged my lazy ass all the way to ngee ann all for the sake to just upload my IMMF assignment onto the Np network.  Bah, should have known that majority of the stalls would be closed on a weekend, and I thought I could have a nice and cheap lunch in np....  Went down to yuhua with a rambling stomach, funnily I ran into michelle and larry at the np bus stop.Upon reaching yuhua, had the good fortune in meeting yewon who was just about to have lunch so yeap, settled lunch rather nicely...After that, it was harmonica practice again, yongxing being forced to do many solos..haha poor guy didnt really like all the attention he was getting..but hey, when you have the talent, its rather hard to escape when its been duly recognised right?   Felt a little sad that I couldn't join the band in breaking a Guiness record by participating in a 1000 strong harmonica band...had to go join the family cause mum bought tickets to go see The Revenge Of The Dim Sum Dollies, my goodness, after watching that stageplay, would wholeheartedly agree that I had no regrets.  Well before I start to elaborate more, just wanna add that I had dinner at SRC, which stands for Singapore Recreation Club, in case you guys don't know where SRC is, it shares the Padang with the Singapore Cricket Club..clear enough? Not eaten there in years.... well and then it was a nice 8 min stroll to the Esplanade.  Good lord, the play was absolutely fantastic! Poked fun at everything that had to do with affairs concerning Singapore. From the rivalry between the best girl schools in Singapore  ( They actually wore a rgs, scgs and chij uniform! ) and with all the female members in my family excluding my mum being scgs girls,  they were seriously tickled. Ah yea as I was saying, more stuff they joked about were like, the abuse of filipino maids, the imitation of singaporean's loathing of parking inspectors..you name it, it poked fun at ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING! And what was even more impressive, they managed to mimic various accents like the indonesian, japanese, filipino and malay accents to such an extent that I was like holy cow!  Bloody impressive play, daresay that the $250 that my parents forked out to watch the show was worth every damn cent.  Well thats it I guess, just had to blog about the Revenge Of The Dim Sum Dollies while it still lingered fresh in ma mind.  Oh yea, went down to Indochine at holland v to tell juwita that I couldn't make it to her engagement party as my harmonica concert unfortunately fell on the same day...bugger... Well when you are in a bar like Indochine, its kinda hard to resist the temptation to drink, especially when you are friends with the staff yea? Lol, drank vodka cranberry with a dash of soda, while my sister drank grenadine with coke. So happy, its been a long time since i last drank decent vodka, and vodka being almost odourless, mum wont find out...ssssh!  Kinda sad that while I am blogging this,  as the rest of the harmonica graduates are now staying overnight in yuhua...having a blast I guess.....  Guess thats all, feeling sleepy.....and the fact that Smackers are having a jamming session at 9 tomorrow, well, lets just say I will be late as usual...wahahahaha.  Not Funny.   Later people.

              Apparently there is a very rich student in Ngee Ann who drives around in a Ferrari...saw it for the second time today in the campus, so decided to post a ferrari pic...it looks like the guy's model but I am not very sure...  At the ending of the entry before this, I mentioned about samurai x. This is a pic taken from the cover of the soundtrack. In case that you have watched samurai x the series, just wanna let you know that the OVA illustrations are so much more beautiful and detailed, which is why kenshin looks different here than in the series...

      Had the violin exam thing today, and yeap, as the title implies, think i screwed it up pretty badly. Firstly the pieces, Stumbled a little during the first piece, damn bow just kept bouncing off the bloody strings, and while trying to achieve a piano effect, think I slowed the tempo down. Second piece? As i said before, the way I play the piece definitely makes Dvorak turn in his bloody grave. Pure musical tormentation I tell you, Didnt know how the examiner took it in his stride...the octaves went a weee out of tune...and of all the things to happen, my damn slightly quivering fingers slipped a little on the fingerboard, thus costing me in my already very pathetic intonation. And as for the third piece, well, think I didnt really make the usual errors I usually make when I play it, though during the  Allegretto  part my intonation went awry AS usual....bleargh.  Scales was at total nightmare...the majors were fine, harmonic minors were also fine...BUT the melodic minors were a total bloody mess...and he gave me B flat melodic minor, which is like the hardest scale to play in grade 6...awww frig it. Dominant sevenths were ok too, though accidentaly added in one extra note..and the WORST was the Diminished Sevenths...despite him being the kind guy and giving me a second try to attempt the diminished sevenths, I erm, politely refused.  If scales was a nightmare, then the aural part was pure hell. I swear that I sung like a dying chicken...and what made matters worst was that I think that my voice cracked a little while singing halfway...oh well, there goes my aural marks...fail it everytime anyway.  Yeap that about sums up my violin exam...think i can jolly well kiss it goodbye and having a grade 6 ranking to my name..oh well. After the exam, had to rush home, rest a while before I had to go out again for dental. Managed to complete one webpage during the bus journey to orchard. Changed the braces colours to green and black!  Reached home, had dinner, played Ground Control II for a while before I started with IMMF. That was like at what, 9pm? And yeap, just finished everything at 2.30a.m. Hell, guess I only have myself to blame for leaving it to the last minute...  Well guess thats it then, now listening to the very emotionally charged soundtrack of the Samurai X OVA..I swear that I have never seen a better anime then this one...hell, all the females who watched cried! Moved me as well too....but yea thats enough, suddenly been hit with a bloody head-splitting headache, and the fact that I am gonna be very busy tomorrow is not comforting at all...  Later people.

       This will be a short entry....   Argh! Its bloody 2 a.m in the morning and here i am struggling with my IMMF assignment...decided to take a break by blogging to let off some steam...so much for a innovative destressing way huh...Bleargh.  Practically slacked during the whole national day weekend...and i did not even manage to put in the usual hours of violin practice when my violin exam is like, in a couple of days time? Friday the bloody thirteenth to be exact...goodness of all the glorious days in the whole year, why did it have to be on a friday the 13th? Dont these dumb brits get the whole superstition thing...? Oh wait...why am i bitchin about it so much...lol.  Singapore idol was bloody hilarious! Seriously, i laughed my ass off the couch...especially that Adrian Khoo guy....sang Careless Whisper by WHISPERING!! Holy Cow! Since when where singaporeans THAT thick-skinned! BAHAHAHAHAHA  Bleargh thats all i guess, no mood to write anymore...and its quite a pity that mei's new cardcam turned out to be a white elephant...poor girl. With that, its bed time.....zzzZZzZZzz.  Later people.

      Oh goodness....i am so bloody shagged....can't stop yawning.....pretty surprising that i have lasted this long considering i only caught about 3 and a half hours of sleep.  Graduates had planned to hold a mini harmonica training camp on friday, well from what i heard it was just meant for us grads as well, we still suck quite badly at the three slavonic dances thing..so yea, guys decided that we could do with the extra practice, and set the time to meet at five p.m in school.  Being a friday, ah well, had another piano accompaniment class...did aural this time...i sincerly swear that she was trying her darnest not to laugh when i sang all out of tune..oh well.  Rushed down to school...only to find that not a single soul was in sight...found out that those clowns were watching the house of flying daggers at jurong point...crap...wanted to catch that movie too..."Amused" myself by practising those damn violin scales over and over again....exam pieces over and over again till Ls reached yuhua at around uh...5.50? Got himself plugged into CM while i continued yada yada yada.....  When we finally got into the harmonica room at around 8pm? Placed orders for a Mcdonald's delivery...yeap. Then it was practice practice practice till about 11.45pm, then we had to see allan off...and at the same time i agreed to help mdm peng's friend to edit the length of a particular song..well, when you have a friend like Jesper in the School Of Audio Engineering, should be an easy task for him yea?  Nothing really much interesting happened later...had noodles...Ls got everyone amused by yelping in fright at his sleeping position's close proximity to a er well, dead roach corpse. Plugged myself into my discman and into the world of 98.7fm at around 3am as i tried to catch some shuteye....proved to be one helluva choice as i later found out that those clowns i.e yewon and george were causing quite some noise outside the harmonica room at around 4 plus am...disrupting most of the people's sleep..me excluded of course mawhahahahaha.  Heard that they started calling people at about 6 plus am to wake them up for harmonica...goodness, really pitied those victims...jingying, shehui, zu er...just to name a few  victimised people ....all just too some people's boredom...though it DOES sound like fun though...in a twisted way.... *smiles sardonically*   Yeap onto Saturday....shehui seemed ok...heard that she actually wept for Jay Chou when she recieved news that his vocal chords were damaged or something like that...hey girl, its not the end of the world yea? Besides people like jay, there are other people that exist in this world...good example would be adorable little ole moi....LOL ok people i didnt mean to make u guys throw up...just a harmless ego joke...mwahahahaha. Yea well it was just more and more practice...skipped lunch to go do the violin again...uh and then after their lunchbreak it was more practice again until i had to leave for violin class. And OH yes, i SWEAR that Jingning & Co. DELIBERATELY arranged for me to sit next to sylvia...hell, hopefully tongues will stay silent...though its great to be sitting next to yeongsheng again, reminds me of the good old times when we struggled together in first high....ah.... *dabs lightly at eyes *  LOL. Okay i think that the fatigue is making me slightly delirious, and the fact that Ja Rule is rappin away in the background doesnt seem to be helpin in anyway....*yAwn*  Er, so after all that, jesper and allan came over to my house...jesper doing the song editing for me, while allan erm...was just to accompany us and to entertain shehui on msn using a mic...hahaha.  Jesper edited the song very nicely...though gave up while trying to do a second version...and we all just went out to makan at je. Had a crappy plate of hokkien mee, had to order another bowl of noodles, mee pok i think, to appease the very dissatisfied stomach.  So yeap, thats that then....really nothing else to write...woot there we go, done with releasing all my crap..*yAwn* crap i really need to get some shuteye, jesper still wants me to go to his house in the morning...heh we shall see about that....so yea, later people.

      Not blogged for quite a while....nothing significant happened over the weekend....slacked as usual....monday was a rather quiet day so well, will jump to a slightly more eventful tuesday.  Tuesday....being an even week, had IAC. Seriously, though i do understand the aim behind Ngee Ann implementing all these modules, i still think they are a serious waste of time. I mean like come on man, how much awareness about the community are you gonna raise by making us do projects like these? Futhermore, we still have to endure the lecturer rambling about the current social stigmas that exist in today's Singaporean society....well yea i guess its something worth mentioning and also something worth thinking about but hey, we have been exposed to something called Social studies since we were like what, primary 4? Down with all these dumb community classes...they are a COMPLETE waste of time! Uh well moving on, did the WAA test, and while the lecturer was talking about the instructions and blah blah blah, i was busy creating a virtual cd of Jay's new album..wahahaha many thanks to sookjai!  WAA test went pretty ok...would be interesting to see how i fare in WAA....and yea, dont know why i am suddenly hooked onto jay..i mean i have always been ok and all with Jay's music and i do have some of his music in the laptop but well, its kinda funny that i am suddenly so into him all of a sudden..hmmm...bah wateva. Went back to yuhua as usual, had fun in teasing shehui about already listening to jay's new album while she was still in school pining away....pity. And oh, it was rather amusing to see poor ys grimacing when well, he got hit by freshly made bird turd during dinner..and to make matters worse, the coffeshop's toilets were under renovation so he had to make a slight detour to another available toilet..wahahaha hey man, what can i say...life's a bitch yea?  Well yea moving on to wednesday....had more fun during FS...did slightly more basic Set Theory..interestingly he introduced formulaes for the Set theory and even more interestingly he merged Set theory with Probability.....woot. Played Cm during the 2 hour long break...and what made today special was that about five of us had Western food take-out in class...pretty ironic when there is a huge No Eatin & No Drinking sign pasted on the door! Had problems trying to hook onto the Np network....so i just listened to Jay with the ear phones on while studying 2's complement while the rest of the class were busy with CS...oh well...bugger...  CSA test...was a major killer....i, being the blind and dumb ass, failed to notice the space inbetween the characters....dang...there went all my marks for the first question...hope he gives me credit for my workings though. And question 2? Seriously hope that my 2' s complement workings are correct...though i already know that my conversion of 145 to hexadecimal is already wrong...which means i got one part of question 2 wrong...boohoo.  Yeap, celebrated little cousin by the name of anna's birthday. Haigen Diaz oreo ice cream cake....heard it cost a whopping hundred and twenty bucks! But  oh maaaaaaaan,  the moment you take a bite out of it, you are seriously in  heaven.   And yeap, that rounds off the day, need to ascend to dreamland, damn classes starts at nine am tomorrow...and oh yea, there is still the psp test to contend with...hopefully its as easy as mr lim says it is...well with that, i am outta hereeee....*yAwn*  Later people.
