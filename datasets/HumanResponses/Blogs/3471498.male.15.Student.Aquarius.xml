      Now, I went to an 18th birthday party a while ago, and from what I can remember it was very good. This link will take you to the site of the band that was playing, they were also very good although I must say Mat (lead guitar) was drunk even before they started.  enjoy:   urlLink http://www.vodkamemories.tk

      I dunno, it may just be me, but I find having a cup of tea solves almost every problem... for a bit at least. Its just simple, The worlds ending! what shall we do while we wait? i know lets put the kettle on for some tea (never coffee). its just one of those things.  ive found cups of tea very handy, although painful when actually handling the very hot cups. its just something you can relie on, a good old british cup of tea (although it is actually chinese).  Sorry people, that iz if anyone does actually comes here, but i find it a lot better typing all this stuff out. It calms the soul, just like a cup of tea.   AH-HA! a cunning plan is a foot, type while having a cup of tea. Its so cunning you could put a tail on it and call it a fox. (good old Blackadder)  by 4 now

      I'm so incredibly bored, the crazy Russians I've been talking to have left, and now I'm all alone since no one txts back anymore...  I would ask everyone if they had any problems but I wouldn't get an answer, I'm still trying to cure world hunger (and then telling no one mwahahahaha) I've  helped fix many a problem but cant seem to fix my own. It's very annoying after a while, and slightly depressing.  well I've talked long enough for now, any body reading must be feeling better by comparing there life to mine.  byby  bob

       Chinese Proverbs   Virginity like bubble, one prick, all gone.   Man who run in front of car get tired.  Man who run behind car get exhausted.  Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.  Foolish man give wife grand piano, wise man give wife upright organ.  Man who walk through airport turnstile sideways going to Bangkok.  Man with one chopstick go hungry.  Man who scratch ass should not bite fingernails.  Man who eat many prunes get good run for money.  Baseball is wrong: man with four balls cannot walk.  Panties not best thing on earth but next to best thing on earth.  War does not determine who is right, war determine who is left.  Wife who put husband in doghouse soon find him in cat house.  Man who fight with wife all day get no piece at night.  It take many nails to build crib, but one screw to fill it.  Man who drive like hell, bound to get there.  Man who stand on toilet is high on pot.  Man who live in glass house should change clothes in basement.  Man who fish in other man's well often catch crabs.  Man who fart in church sit in own pew.  Crowded elevator smell different to midget. HAHAHA! i luv these. But to get some of them u have to think at whats being said (it took me a while with the thinking bit :-)

      Did u know that pirates wore gold earings because they thought it improvered there eyesight, bet you didnt did you.  what an interesting fact to start us off, i found that out in a book i was reading (yes i can read) it was quite depressing, fitted my mood perfectly.  Neways HOW HARD IS BLOODY WORK EXPERIENCE! alot in my case. im sure all you people who are pushing pencils would disagree but my jobs really tiring. But i get paid so thats all my complaining.  alot of films are out at the moment arent there, yes, o glad u agree (talking to yourself 1st sign of madness (getting an answer 2nd sign)). i think i remember sumone saying about our group going up to see sumthing 1 day, i havent been told anything more though.  hmmm... anything else i can depress you people with? o, i remember, not depressing but anyway, HAPPY BIRTHDAY HIPPY!!! hope you liked the cheese.  so ill leave you now to go drink my troubles away (though we've ran out of drink so im using applejuice)  byby
