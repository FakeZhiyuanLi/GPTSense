      Hi there and welcome to my first posting, thanks for takeing the time to look in and i hope youll keep coming back and let me no how im doing.   Well i think i should start off by putting down what im hopeing to achieve here , why im keeping this blogg. whats it all about etc......  Well I have been fortunate enought ot recently find something that has been missing in my life for a very very long time, and something that is not at first easy to explaine. Im not like the majority of people out there and for a long period in my life ive known i dont fit in . normal life just dosent feel right for me i have a much deeper and more primal side that for far to long i needed to both become aware of and start to satisfy. so what am i yammering on about ??  well im a slave , a daddys boy and thats somethign which isnt at first easy to explain but is a huge part of who I am. I dont feel complete or a whole person without haveing something vitally important to my state of beeing ( God this is getting heaavy alreddy) I need to be owned controled and taken over completly by another man, and for those of you reading this who arnt in the bdsm comunity i no that this is goign to be a concept thats totally alien for you , and for that im very sorry. i hope youll bear with me as i fumble my way through trying to clarify all this .  There was until very recently a huge gaping hole inside me a need for something that for many years i didnt understand, im fortunate enough now to have become aware and come out to myself, which is wounderfull its given me a chance to be the person i need to be. Ive been fortunate enough to meet an incredable man, my Dad and Master, Bearfoot. Ive submited fully to his authority and am owned out right by him. what does that meen well basically I am his boy and slave, im here to satisfy his needs in every way and i couldent be more happy about it . for the first time in my life i feel totally complete and at peace. I have a long and very hard journey in front of me , im going to stumble a lot, I have alreddy and i no i will contimnue to do so. but im on a wounderfull journmey guided by my Dad and Master.   It involves giving over full controll of my life to him, all deescisions, financial controll, how i dress look act my day to day duties and responsabilitys, everything. And being owned totally. it involves Satisfying my Dads every need , be that a sexual, sadistic, or mundane house hold request . i Do it with out question or thought . total obedience. I no by now a lot of you will be eather horified or wont be able to get your heads round this, but belive me its a wounderfull and beutifull thing to give yourself totaly and completly to another man. to pass on all controll. to me it has been a case of giving up so litttle and gaining so much in return.  on wedensday 8th My Dad snaped his collour round my neck and i was finally and totally owned. and i cant tell you how proud I feel to ware this collor. well im begining to waffle here i have so much more to say but i think i need to calm my head a little before posting so illleave you with this . Im totaly new to this world but feel totally at peace and comfortable in it. I find it over whelming emotional scarey and for the first time in my life i no im exactly where i need to be. its going to be hard, its going to be very dificulyt at times its going to scare the hell out of me and im going to be pushed to places i never thought i could go , but its also going to be wounderfull and i cant wait . so keep poping in and ill keep you updated with all my hopes fears concerns happy and sad moments the mistakes i make, and the hurdles i climb for my Dad. im at the start of a wounderfull road here and i hope youll come along with me

      Hi every body , once again I apologize for the lack of postings, my Dad came down to visit on Saturday and is staying here for a couple of weeks :)  you can imagine how chuffed I feel. Well things are going very well. Its almost a month since I earned my collar and so far so good. Im still blissfully happy .                 Well what have I been up to :) after I came back to Wales from Manchester I've been pining like there's no tomorrow , but now Dad's here and im walking 6 feet above the ground. We've had some magical days since Dad came down, the first  was on Sunday. At around 3 am we went for a walk up the hill behind the village , in the rain and with the thunder rattling around, we could see lightning on the horizon, and across the loughour estuary to llanelli all  light up.  Its quite a magical view. At he top we talked for a while then Dad ordered me to strip.  I did straight away and although ti was cold and wet and I was shivering, it was wonderful. I was standing there naked with my Dad on top of the hill watching the mist rolling in off the sea and feeling the rain power down over me. What made it even more magical was Dad telling me how proud of me he was.  It was a very special evening , very profound on a lot of levels and something I don't think ,me or Dad are going to forget for a while   Monday we went out shopping for boots and me and Dad managed to find some excellent ex army boots for both of us.  Which we promptly went and broke in charging round the local lazer dome, good fun was had by all , but im still not sure where shooting your Dad fits in to the whole Master slave etiquette.   and today has also been really special  me and Dad ordered a  urlLink cb2000   . Dad wants to keep me in chastity , except for special occasions  and it arrived this morning :)  so you can imagine how long work today while I was waiting to get home :)  . Well when I eventually got back here after dinner Dad fitted me with it and I have to say it feels great and im bloody proud to ware it .  so in synopsis how are things going. Fantastic, absolutley no regrets, every day that passes just makes me more and more glad that Dad gave me his collar. im finally exactly where I need to be and feel totally happy. Im haveing a wonderful time with my Dad and serving him and being his boy just gets better and better.  well will close for now, but im going to do my best to try and post atleast once a week if not more  so please keep coming back and see how im doing :)

      been a good day today :)  ive found out that im geting my student loan  so ging back to uni is on :) just as well really conmsidering all teh whoo ha thats going on at work.  so tomorow im off in to chat to my boss and sort out switching to part time  eeeeep.  had a good day today went for a walk round the reserviours with DAD hes been down and very quiet all day i think it helped a bit we had a good old natter abiout a few things. inparticular about  experiences and becoming jaded with them  i think what brought it on was walkign through all teh beutiful contry side me being moved by it all and DAD looking at trees and going oh look big vegtables. we talked alot about thibgs weve always wanted to do whale watching in canada and treking over the andies that type of thing. and DAD thinks that hes so jaded now that none of that would have any meening for him. I disagree i dont think its a case of being jaded , i think its a case of haveuing been in a bad place for a very long time. My DAD bear has had soem severe depression issues to cope with over the past few years. i think that together slowly bit by bit working together that hell get his enjoyment of the world back again  one small step at a time. although i think my DAD bear needs convincing  :) im one cub who dosent give up that easily though.  been an eventfull weekend. i was quite ill over the first part over exausterd adn my diabeties was playing up . id been burning the candles at bioth ends abit . i had big dark cyrcles under my eyes was very dizzy and had an acheing head. so i took two days of work and slept for most of them . we had our mate greggy over and me being a bit under the wether put a bit of a dampner on the sex side of things but we still had a bit of a fumble. i think greggy had a good time.  Me and DAD had a bit of fun though  weve made our own porn moovie :) quite pleased with the results too weve got video eddeting software on the pc and have done quite a good jiob wihtit i think  at the moment im still feeling a little rough and a bit stressed and frustrated not in any big way , im just frustraded really cause my DAD bear is down at the moment and theres not a lot i can do to help des[pite my best efforts. lots going on too witht he change at work, switching to part time , sorting out the new flat  the hospitals money and everythign else thats going on buit im holding it together  so far so good and all that   right time to go make a cuppa i think by for now

Something I've always wanted to do its about 600 miles from st michals mount in Cornwall to great Yarmouth in norfolk. What im really hoping to do is turn it into a chatrity event for  urlLink the wls site  I've got a fe w ideas on that poss setting up a fund so people can apply for a grant to see there consultant for there first apointment privately .could cut a year or a couple of years of the weight people have. be nice to tey and help people who are on low incomes and cant aford to do the inital asesment privately.  secondly ive started work on  urlLink galaru  again  working on the opening animations for teh game. im rendering a 30 second fly by and its takeing 36 hours to render. tell you what though thisis going to be an awsome game.  and to top it off ive started putting pen to paper on a book that ive wanted to wright  mcaled green wich its a look at my own personal view of paganism and wicca. more on thay in future posts :)  so , as you can see im kind of working myself out of it LOL   any ways have laods fo stuff to do. i want to fifnish the first chapter of greenwich tonight, plus draught my letter to the wls group to sugest teh charity fund and the fund raising idea . that and i need to have a tidy up round here for DAD coming down   LOL bizzy cub

      rice cakes  now theres alot to be said for the humble rice cake,  as im just begingin to discover they are not infact small round costers with the look and consistancy of polystyrene.  since my banding ive found it quite hard to eat bread as it all sort of recombobulates in my tum and bungs the band up  and i spend the next 20 mins doing my frog impression hic-ribbit hic-ribbit  any hoo after my flat mate spoted them going cheep i delved into the dark art of the rice cake. ok at first there a little bland but with a litle marge on and WOW boy do the taske good,  with cream chese roasted red pepper and baby spinage on top there pretty spectacular and for a purley pornographic food moment i recomend asparagus cup a soop with butterd rice cakes to dunk  ive found a whole new favourit snack :)  any way nibbling aside  had a great today i woke up full of energy and have nbeen zooming around teh house like a thing posesd. ive lost about a stone and boy do i feel it  so far ive finished the washing washed bessy waterd the garden been for a 5 mile walk and im stil readdy fro more   he he super cub !!!!!!  i think its because as i loose weight im gonna have more muscle bilt up that  ineed or to put it another way us fat bastards need a lot more muscle to cart teh weight around so when the weight goes the muscle is still there :)  im going to have to try and keep it so im gonmna do my best to exercise more nothing boring  just walking cycling swiming that sort of thing.  It Did set me thinking though ive always wanted to walk the ickneild way and i used to love long distance walking.  its about 400 miles from st michals mount in cornwall to yarmouth in east anglia. im hatching the iodea of training my self up for it and nextr summer gettign sponsord adn fund rasing for the wls charity plus rasining awareness whil im doing it.  have to clear it with DAD first though  he he today has so far been a very good day :)

      Morning,          Well I say morning its just gone 3:30 in the afternoon and im a bit annoyed with meself.  I had all these great ideas about getting up this morning doing a shed load of washing then cycling off to the beach for a spot of sunbathing and skinny dipping .   didn't wake up till 2 pm   BUGGER  oh well not to worry  got the washing on the go and ill make an effort to get out there and give bessy a good clean too.  You no I don't no what's up with me at the moment I seem to be a bit wishy washy no enthusiasm and cant pluck up the energy to do anything. I don't think im depressed I just need my DAD to give me a kick up the arse I think LOL.  so to make up for it im bizzying myself round the house tiding up the kitchen  washing up etc etc  boring I no but needs doing . One good thing though its given me a chance to catch up with my online stuff and I've just been over to the  urlLink wls  site the what I here you cry ?? Well I am what is nown in medical and technical terms as a " FAT BASTARD "  something which im actually immensely proud off , but I had all sorts of health stuff going wrong and wound up getting my stomach banded on April 2nd.  Its a bit like a stomach staple but a little more down market. Any ways I digress       after trawling through the millions of posts I've missed over the past couple of months I found one from a medical research company who want to give me 30 squid for a telephone interview  RESULT !!!!. He he so il call them on Monday .       Actually as im sure DAD will tell you im a bit of a media slut about all this ill have been on telly twice and radio once chatting about the op  infact if any of you are in the Wales telly region or can get welsh beeb 1 tune in on Tuesday for week in week out and im on there :) they've even got film of my operation .  EUGH!  oh well not to worry time to go hang out another load of washing  a slaves life of drugery is never done :0-)

                    Wow well what can i say other than sorry its been a gap of what nearly 6 months since i posted on here .  A lot has gon on in the last 6 months . a lot of good stuff and also a lot of hard stuff.  on the slave and sm side of things  weve had to go a lot slower than eather of us hoped. lots of reasons why , i had an extended stay in hospital to get my gastric band put in, moving between manchester ans swansea . lots of hassils with work  to name just a few. I wont bore you with all the details but things are looking up .                In september im moving to my own place which is going to change everything . at the moment im shareing a house with two other non sm blokes who are a bit prudish so i cant be nacked at home cant follow my DAD's house rules ect ect. so in september we start for real . me and DAD can begin to live the way we want to 24/7 difrent from the odd bit here and there me and DAD can snatch. which is going to be great.  We have bessy now our car which meens were going to be nmobile and getting oput visiting other sm couples going to events etc etc is no longer a problem. and im of back to uni full time adn working part time :) so much less pressure from my crap job . so all in all things are abouytt o gete much better  now that we have a plan of action and some serious goals we can work towards. were finally going to be in a postion where i can be my DAD's 24 /7 slave wether im in manchester or swansea or whereever we are .   and i tell u what   i cant wait.    Im still as keen as ever to be a slave for my DAD bear and i no hes going to train me and mol;d me in to the best damn person i can be.  its going to be dificult  and scarey at times a lot of hard work but very very worth it   i no my DAD is going to take me firmly but lovingly and push me ,in all sorts of ways allways extending my limits a bit at a time till im a real no limits slave for him  im a very lucky lad indeed
