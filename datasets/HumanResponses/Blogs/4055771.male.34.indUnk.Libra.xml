      I stopped to scrutinize Wayne Chabre's sculpture - which is called "Second Growth" - at the Albina/Mississippi MAX stop and I can say with some certainty that the spoon-shaped object is not a spoon for cooking junk.  I don't know what it is.  I wonder if rain collects in it.  I would like it if it did, despite the fact that standing water breeds West Nile Virus spreading mosquitoes, just because I like the idea of rainwater being involved in Portland's public art.   For the most part Chabre's bronze mass is made up of melting shapes of musical instruments and sheet music.  And I neglected to mention that if I'm right that those other shapes are hops & grapes, they're almost certainly intended to be a tribute to (or product placement for) the Widmer Brewery, which is just two blocks away (whose big beery clouds often come breathing warmly down as one walks by) than they are a reference to the Albina District's struggles with alcoholism.  But then again, those grapes...the Madrona Hill Winery used to be right there too.  That place was one of my favorite music venues in the mid-90s.  You could buy a bottle of wine for $4 and wander the floor drinking straight from it.  I remember seeing Hazel and Bugskull there, and I would have been there to witness Courtney Taylor meeting Michael Stipe if it hadn't been for one extremely drunk, recently suicidal girl who I didn't even know who needed to be taken home before she got into trouble.  Who tried very hard to bed me.  Who woke up the next morning and didn't even know my name.  Now it's me who doesn't remember hers.   I should point out that while "Second Growth" portrays a quasi-organic form bursting through a patch of busted up concrete, the sculpture itself sits on a very large, pristine concrete base.  Talk about a mixed message.  They lay down a big chunk of concrete to serve as the base for a sculpture that celebrates the power of an organic form to burst through concrete - and yet the form  actually  portrays ART, ARTIFICE, not organism.  What up with that?  Making matters worse, this art imitating organism that represents art is also engaged in trying to  visually  express an  auditory  art form: jazz music, which once thrived in the Albina district along Williams Avenue.   North Portland's jazz & blues scene of the 50s, 60s &amp; 70s is the historical giant on whose shoulders one is supposed to wistfully stand when one stands at the Albina/Mississippi stop.  Once, looking North up the hill, before Interstate 5 and the Fremont Bridge came plowing through, one would have seen houses and street level businesses, and a thriving African American community.  Now one sees the immaculate Widmer facilities and the now-McMenimans-run historic White Eagle bar & hotel.  Beyond that, the sad pink stucco building that houses  Project Network , a service provider, mostly to African American women who smoke, who sit on the bench and the overturned recycling bins in the middle of the sidewalk beside the gravel lot that Cloudburst Recycling parks its big trucks in.  The women who sit there and smoke and avoid making eye contact and after one passes by speak in low voices and laugh.  And further north along Mississippi Avenue, the city's heavy trucks grind gears and lurch around in the Albina Yard.  The Fremont Bridge onramps that careen overhead cast a tangle of shadows that fall where kids used to play in front of houses.

      I have discussed this with L, and she thinks I'm taking this idea way too far, but I insist: Portland's public art is obsessed with the idea that we live in the ruins of former greatness.  On the northwest corner of Pioneer Square there are the fallen Roman Columns, made to sit & play chess on.  The Eastbank Esplanade, my favorite part of my walk to work, features fallen standing stones around the fire station and, I swear, the whole of the Esplanade's design screams  industrial ruins slowly consumed by nature .  Walking along the eastbank between Ash & Morrison Streets, the bushy plantings completely obscure the freeway so all you perceive is the roar of invisible traffic, ghost cars.  Where a sea wall once stood, there's now a pile of rubble with pigeons roosting and blackberry brambling.  L particularly thinks I'm stretching it with my reading of the Esplanade, but even she will not deny that the big round spiky thing lying on its side over by the Rose Quarter (home of Portland's Trailblazers) has to be a fallen crown.  Yes, once we were kings.  In 1977 I think.   Putting a twist on this theme, the art at the yellow line MAX stop at the Rose Quarter features bronze casts of the stumps of old growth trees laid into the sidewalk and big Suessian solar-powered tree-light sculptures that are winkingly titled  Silicon Forest .  I could like this work if I wasn't prejudiced against the artist because of his association with CityRepair, a group I could respect if they would stop twisting citizens' arms into allowing them to produce their solar-phallic hippie mandalas on everyone's corner, if they would stop using the word "community" coercively.  I'm sure it's apparent that I have issues with them.  Still, I can't deny that the message of  Silicon Forest  is importantly different: where the other projects get wistful about the decline of empire while celebrating the restoration of nature,  SF , despite it's Seussical whimsy, asserts the more realistic history: that once forests, not doric columns or pseudo-druidic standing stones, grew where the asphalt now is spread.  And growing up in their place?  Plastic & metal things that glow in the dark.  The installments at Pioneer Square and by the fire station on the esplanade are the product of wishful delusion and undeserved self-congratulation by comparison.  The sculpture at the north end of the Albina/Mississippi MAX stop weighs in with yet another vision of urban decay/renewal: a bronze "vine" bursts up through blacktop and as it rises it blooms with the forms of musical instruments and, consulting the artist's site ( urlLink http://www.waynechabre.com/pubart.html ) I could be wrong but I think I see grapes and maybe hops and perhaps even a spoon for cooking junk.  What am I seeing exactly?  I should look more closely on my way home tonight.
