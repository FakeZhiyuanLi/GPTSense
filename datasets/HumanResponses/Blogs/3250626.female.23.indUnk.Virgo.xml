      Don't just love being sick?  No really the time you get to spend coughing up the nastiest green stuff you have ever seen or the blowing of the nose every 5 minutes or less.  Being sick really sucks, but one good things about it is staying home.  Well at least that used to be the good thing about it.  Remember when you were little and having a sick day from school was one of the best time, especially when you got old enough to stay home by yourself.  I loved theses days sitting on the sofa watching movies, having your mom or dad make you good food and taking care of you.  Then you got to college and the first time you were sick in the dorms nobody was there to really take care of you and all you wanted to do was be at home.  But you got used to it and walked your sick body with no energy across the campus to health services.  I remember one time my junior year of college when I was so sick I could barely walk.  All I wanted to was to go home so I loaded up on cough medicine and drove the six hour drive and I couldn't remember barely any of it.  I was so sick. Well blah blah blah.    Now I am officially an "adult" and I am taking time off of work, unpaid time off which I need because I am sick. But again I say it is one of the most relaxing times.  Knowing that I will only have a three day week this week and then a three day weekend.  Yeah:) Relaxing and living a happy life are very important to me!

      So,  I spent a half hour writing this very long blog about mother's day weekend and I went to publish it and lost it.  So frustrating.  Any way a quick update about mother's day weekend.  Good friends, fun pregnant cousins, fun trying on my cousin's engagement rings, relaxing and exactly what I needed. These past couple of weeks have been good, Kit was home last week which was so nice. Over the weekend we spent as much time outside as possible playing frisbee golf, taking our cat Marcello outside on a leash.  That was a very fun experience.  He did a great job and was so excited about being outside.  We worked out alot and just had a good time just the two of us.    Work is going good today one of the funniest moments is when I look over at the bathroom and one of the little boys is wiping another boys poopy butt.  It was gross and hilarious.  I ran across the room to stop them before it became a huge poopy mess!   I always have a lot of funny stories about the bathroom and they usually envole poop, which is actually really strange.  Sometimes I feel like a mother, I carry animal crackers in my purse, I am wiping butts all day, but I love my job.  The kids are great, but they totally get on my nervous sometimes, especially when all they want to do is sound like a fire engine siren.  15 kids screaming at the top of the lungs is a bit nerve racking.  But I am very proud of them all and I love all of the hugs!  So kit and I are looking for a place to move to.  I went to go see this house today, which from the outside looked great.  Well the closer I got the house it wasn't that great.  It could have been because the people who lived there were slobs or because there was poison ivy all over the side of the house.  The lady who showed me the house had never been in it before and she was very embarrassed to show the house to me.  There were two cabinets, one with a sheet over it and the other was very small.  The lady kept saying, where do they put everything.  Well it is so frustrating looking for a place to live.  We really have tried to find a house or duplex so we feel more like we are at home.  Our apartment is very nice and we like it, but we really want more of a home feeling.  Sometimes in an apartment I just feel trapped.  I want to be able to walk out my door onto a backyard, put up my hammock and read a book, or have a small garden where I can spend my time.  We also want to be closer to downtown and campus because we hopefully won't have to drive so much.  We like living close to the zoo and it would be nice for me to walk to school when I eventually go back and get my teaching degree.  (which my mom is ecstatic about!) So now we are in the dilemma of still looking for a place to live or staying where we are.  It is a hard decision and those who know kit and I well know we aren't the best decision makers! :)   I am very happy living in Madison, but sometimes it would be nice to be in the country, with a lot of woods around us.  Madison is such a fast paced life, it is good to get back to the slower life kit and I enjoy!  That's why we should just move to switerland or Italy.  We are really thinking about it.  That would be great!!!!  Well thats about it.  Ciao~

      it is amazing how you can be 23 years old and still feel like you are in high school.  That is how it is at my work sometimes.  There are only 4 guys who work there are about 20 girls.  Well we all know how girls like to gossip.  I personally try to stay away from the gossip going on at work.  I either ignore the situation or walk away from it.  Well my old co-teacher Susie informed me today that certain people at work dislike the way I run my classroom.  Who cares right, it is my classroom.  Well my problem is their kids will eventually be in my classroom and well as Susie put it "They have a say what goes on in their child's classroom".  I really could care less if they have a problem with the way that I teach, what bugs me is all of the talking about people behind their back.  Seriously you walk by my room everyday, stop in and say Blah, Blah Why do you do this?  I know I will never get away from gossiping, it just urks me when people have the guts to talk to everyone else about you, but won't come up to your face and talk about it.  And of course the loving motherly type that Susie is she acts like I can't handle a little cirtisim.  Sometimes I want to walk up to her and say cut the crap, I have been through worse things said to me than I don't like the way you teach.  Sometimes it makes me just laugh thinking about how people are so insecure with their own like that they have to pick on someone else's life.  Many people will not agree with my life, but it is my life and I really am happy with it.  As Kit always says just be happy with yourself and your life, that's all anyone asks of you!   That's all of my complaining for today, now I am going to enjoy this amazing beautiful day.  Tada nats

      So I have a whole bunch on crazy stories.  It all started two weeks ago when Kit and I drove to Carbondale for a week vacation.  We started off by relaxing in the heat and having a wonderful time.  Kit went on to bonnaroo and I stayed there and had a great time hanging out with my pregnant cousin Sara.  We had such a good time just the girls.  It was so nice to have girl time.  I didn't want to go back to work, but oh well it was time.  So I went back to work on Thursday morning June 17th and found out I couldn't take this stuipd class I had to take because I missed two of them while I was on vacation.  Now we found out we had to take this class 3 days before I left for vacation and I asked the director if I could still take it even though I missed the first one, she said yes.  Well since I missed the second one because it was scheduled on a day I was still gone, I now could not take the class.  Well I was a bit upset.  So I went and asked the director, who has never really liked me that much, why I couldn't take the class I HAD to take here at work anymore.  She said because I missed two classes and now I had to find another way to take this class by August.  I was very mad, so we started discussing it more and she got very snotty with me, like she always does.  Telling me it is not her problem, I need to fiqure it out on my own.  Which she always does to me.  Whenever I have a problem, or a question, she never helps me and is always a snot to me.  Well I made my first mistake and started getting a bit snotty back to her.  She then starts yelling at me, so I raised my voice.  I couldn't understand how I can be penalized for being on vacation.  She told me to mind my P's and Q's because she is sick of my attitude and I am going to get fired if I don't watch it. So I asked her in a calmer voice, when Have I had an attitude problem before. I was never once told that I had an attitude problem.  She told me to Walk away from her, so I did.  I was very upset  and crying so I went to my friends classroom to talk to her.  She calmed me down and told me not to worry about it.  So I went back to my classroom and Carmen the director came up to me and asked me to come into the office.  So I thought we were going to talk about things.  First thing I said was I am sorry,I over reacted  and I shouldn't have raised my voice.   She goes I don't care Natalie your done.  I looked at her and asked if we could talk about this.  She said Natalie it doesn't matter what you say, you are fired pack your things and get out now.    So crying I went back to my classroom and packed up my stuff.  my co teacher was so upset and the kids kept asking my why I was crying and why i was leaving. It was so hard and terrible.  THat place has some huge issues and I am actually happy to be out of there.  The management is always telling lies and starting rumors about people.   Which is now happening to me, even the owner which I never had any problems with is telling lies about me to my friends, the parents of my kids and they all know that they are lies.  Some of the parents in my class were very upset, yet the owner told lies to make them feel like I was a lousy teacher, which I wasn't.  I was never, ever mean to the children, I always put a huge effort into my classroom and I am very upset that I got fired over a stupid arguement that could have been solved rationally and professionaly.  I don't disagree that I made a mistake in the way that I talked to my director this one time, but never before have I done that.  Yes I have been assertive and I did ask alot of questions, but I was never trained on what to do in my room, just thrown in there with out any direction at all.  So of course i had new ideas and lots of questions.  But after the hundreth time of asking questions and NEVER getting them solved, gets a bit frustrating.    Anyway over a week later and things are going well.  It defeintly is a blow to the system to be fired from a job, but it isn't all that bad.  I have applied to go to a school in madison to get my teaching degree.  so hopefully I will get in and get on the ball with that.  I wish I would have done this the first time around, but oh well, everything happens for a reason.  So that is my crazy life right now.  I have been keeping myself very busy with the school stuff and I am looking forward  to going back to school.  This weekend has been a great one too!!!

      I sit here in Carbondale I wonder about all of the people who have come in and out of my life in this town.  The people who has passed away, the people who are far away and the people who are still my closest and dearest people in my life.  I always consider coming back to this place as relaxing and fun, yet at times it can be very boring.  I thought this weekend would be great for me, alone relaxing time, then I realize, I spend alot of time alone.  Kit is gone alot and I don't do much at night when he is gone.  I wonder why I didn't pack my backs hop in the van and just go to Bonnaroo with Kit and his family.  I do regret it now.  I love the time I got to spend with my cousin yesterday it was amazing and so much fun, but I do wish that I would have  gone to Bonnaroo.  I miss kit and I miss that hippie lifestyle that Bonnaroo gives you.  I guess that I am kind of feeling lonely and sad for some reason.  I don't want to be in this slump again.

      Warm weather, sitting in your apartment sweating up a storm, what the life.  I am so excited for the summer to start.  I only wish that I would have a nice long summer break, just like I use too.  I am going to have a little break from things starting at 4pm tomorrow when I get off of work.  I am going to So. Illinois to hang out with my so very cute pregnant cousin Sara.  I am also going to be house and cat sitting for Kit's parents while the whole family is at the most amazing music festival Bonarroo.    Bonarroo is one of those festivals where a community just pops out of nowhere.  All of a sudden there is 90,000 people camping in very close proximately and loving every minute of it.  There is a feeling of zen and happiness.  It is amazing how a farmer's field turns into a place to shop, see awesome bands, watch movies, play video games, eat great vegetarian food, and just really feel like you are free and playful.  It is almost like being a kid at a water park or amusement park for the first time with out your parents.    I have gone the last two years and really considered going this year, but I need a time to just sit on my butt in the sun, read a book and just really relax.  I haven't had anytime like that since i became a preschool  teacher.  Not that Bonarroo is stressful it is jut three days of music that starts at noon and goes until 6 or so in the morning, is a bit tiring.   I am starting to feel a bit sad that I won't be there especially after reading Kit's blog on his feelings of Bonarroo.  If you want to check it out it is at: kitelam.blogspot.com.   Feel free, he says it alot better than I do.    Well to all of those people who are going to this great festival of our life time, remember those who can't be there with you, keep them in your thoughts as you listen to your favorite bands, songs and just get that feeling that life couldn't get better than this!

      One of the longest days:   Sitting in the hospital room after my brother's surgery.&nbsp; Watching him sleep as my dad rubs his had.&nbsp; His face is swollen, but not too bad.&nbsp; He has plastic tubes up each nostril that helps him breath and keeps the blood from clogging up his nasal passages.&nbsp; He is swallowing a lot of blood because his mouth is wired shut, which makes him sick to his stomach.&nbsp; As he goes in and out of consciousness,&nbsp; I wonder what he is thinking, is he in a lot of pain.&nbsp; He realizes what is going on and it scares him a bit. I think to myself, Why does he have to go through so much pain? His surgery was on his jaw.&nbsp; They broke the top jaw to move it forward and the bottom jaw to move it backwards.&nbsp; He has two huge ice packs on his cheeks to keep the swelling down and a wash cloth on this head.&nbsp; As he breathes, which he does fine, into a oxygen mask I think about why he had this surgery again.&nbsp; This surgery was not a "need now" surgery but it was needed.&nbsp; If he did not get his jaw broken and moved he could have major complications later in life.&nbsp; (his lower jaw stuck out past this upper jaw)&nbsp; It is a long process of the complications and why that is very complicated to explain right now.&nbsp; Anyway he decided to have the surgery in November. I know I didn't realize what was really going to happen.&nbsp; I guess I never really put too much thought into the actually recovery time.&nbsp; I use to think it was like an in and out surgery like getting your wisdom teeth pulled.&nbsp; I never thought you would be hooked up to lots of machines and be in such great amounts of pain. He is on morphine along with other medications which makes him sleep a lot, which is good.&nbsp; And we sit here and watch him.&nbsp; Watch his every move, to make sure that nothing goes wrong. We pray and pray that God will keep him safe&nbsp; and that he won't get too sick to his stomach and start throwing up.&nbsp; IF you know my brother, you understand.&nbsp;   I guess everyone goes through some huge event like this in their life.&nbsp; IT is stressful on all of us to watch him have to go through this , but their is nowhere I would rather be.&nbsp; I feel bad for all of the times I didn't hang out with Nick when I could have.&nbsp; I hope that we grow closer as we get older, just as we have in the past four years.&nbsp; Being an older sibling, you always have this need to protect your other siblings.&nbsp; I remember when Nick was in kindergarten and two girls tripped him with a jump rope and he busted his chin open.&nbsp; I was so upset and wanted to help him so bad, yet I was only in 3rd grade and all I could do was comfort him by sitting next to him.&nbsp; So that is my job again.&nbsp; Even if I make no huge difference in being there in the hospital with him at least I was there and he knows it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I could though, I would take away any pain he would have to go through in life.&nbsp; But what is life with out pain??!!! I just pray that things will be ok and that he will be happy with the way he looks and have a positive outlook about spending six weeks with his mouth wired shut.&nbsp; God bless you Nick,&nbsp; I love you as does every one you meet.&nbsp; you are such an absolute amazing strong person.&nbsp; You have such a great and kind heart.&nbsp; I adore you and hope that I can help in any way to get you through the rough times a head.&nbsp; God please watch over him.&nbsp;   To all those who pray, keep Nick in your prayers, and for all those who don't pray keep Nick in your thoughts!!!

      A week at the Beach........... and more  Kit and I just went to Florida last week. We had the greatest time laying on the beach all day, playing the the water, reading and actually spending time together. It was so much fun and so relaxing. We went out to eat and ate the Best seafood I have had since we went to Martha's Vineyard last summer. It was perfect. Now we are back in Madison and a huge decision is waiting to be made. To move or to stay in Madison. I got into a private school in Madison which I can't afford so that is out of the question. I also got into UW madison as a special student and I got into SIU in the college of Education. Kit got into grad school at SIU also. So we were plan on moving to SIU if I got this job that would pay for my schooling, which I can't get. But now it is pretty much the same for me, either I get a part time job and go the school here in Madtown or I get a part time job and go to school in C'dale. It wouldn't take me as long if I went to SIU b/c I am already in the Education department and it all of my classes transfer. Not so in Madison, it might take me up to 3 and 1/2 years!!! I should just become a freaking doctor if it will take me that long! No I don't really care that much. Kit and I both love living in Madison. We have made some really great friends and would be very sad to leave and we need to find subletter for are apartment. so as it goes we are confused and excited. Any suggestions on what we should do would be great!!!! :)  My brother is doing much better and only has 3 weeks left!!! So that is very exciting. Marcello had a crazy night yesterday. He pooped and it got all over this tail and legs. So Kit laughing and totally grossed out and me chasing Marcello around the house for about a half an hour wiping his butt and tail which was hilarious. We didn't want Marcello to get poop everywhere, which we was. He kept biting us and was so pissed off that we were wiping his butt. When we got most of it we were laying in bed and Marcello comes up and lays by kit, when he got up Kits was like" Oh man I smell poop, where is that coming from, does Marcello still have poop on him. " I didn't think so but Kit kept saying he smelt poop. Then he smells his shoulder and it smelt like poop so bad. He starts yelling, " my shoulder smells like poop! " and he was freaking out a bit. It was quite a night, with us chasing Marcello around wiping his butt!!! We laughed for hours.
