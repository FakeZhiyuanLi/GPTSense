						   ...Who was this strange man telling us not to get up? And why was I so dizzy?. 2 questions that a 5 year old could not answer.. The mystery was solved a few years back, when I was told what happened. My sister and I waited a few minutes.. sitting on the patio, with blankets around us.. both scared and worried about what was going on in the house.  Many sounds surrounded us, the dog barking, many people talking out in front of the house, and more sirens in the distance. I kept wondering what could possibly be going on.. and where was my mom and dad.  I got up, going to find my parents, and my sister told me to sit down.  I kept walking toward the house, and quietly opened the sliding glass door.  I peeked in and not seeing anyone, I went in.. Keeping quiet as a mouse.  Just as I walked in, I saw a light in the garage and heard voices coming from there.. and I could hear my mom's loud voice, moaning and crying.. I could also hear this loud smacking sound.. over and over.  I walked to the garage door, and noticed it was cracked so I pushed my way in.  What I saw next, I'll never forget.. My mom sitting on the driveway, my dad slumped over on the ground next to her.  The smacking sound I heard was my mother slapping his back.. moaning and telling him to wake up.  There was so much commotion going on, I was beginning to cry myself.  Knowing I wasn't suppose to be there, afraid the "stranger" may come back at any time telling me to go back and sit down, I kept quiet.  About the time I was just beginning to absorb everything around me, my mom's best friend emerged out of the crowd that was surrounding my mom and scooped me up and took me inside.  Linda Wheeler was the most sweetest, loving lady I'd ever met in my life.. Immediately I began to feel better.. laying my head on her shoulder, I closed my eyes thinking how wonderful it'd be if only she were my mom..

						   Wow, this is a great site, but where to start?  Maybe from the beginning.  The old saying goes unhappy childhood = unhappy life.. is this true? Where does one find this "so called" happiness?  I think many people search their entire lives and never really find it..  Here's my story.. I'm sticking to it..  Cynde, military born in Germany October 6, 1966.  First bits of information I remember were when I was about 4 to 5 years old, living in Euless, TX.  Bits and pieces of information come to mind in this house, not too many.  I can remember the white poodle, toodles. I guess she stands out so grand in my mind, because I put her in the freezer for a bit, to see how cold she'd get.  I had no earthly idea she'd freeze to death... Well, I had planned on getting her out, but mom called me for nap time, so I completely forgot about her until an hour later, she asked me where the dog was.  I jumped up and fetched her out, but from what I remember I think it was too late, they were able to revive her, but she died shortly after that from many medical complications.  Marked as an evil child from then on... I continued to do things to live up to my name.  My sister, we will talk in much detail about her in good time, proceeded to call me the "devil's child" for many years.  I had a small mole/bald spot on the right side/top of my head where she insisted was the mark of the beast revealing 666.  She then told me, "well, look at your birthday.. only the devil's kid would be born 10-6-66!"  Well, being only 5.. I, for many years, believe she was right.   I guess for many years, I tried very hard to be a good child.. bound and determined not to do bad things and maybe I could reform myself.  A few months after the dog incident, I was woken up in the dead of night by a stranger.  I remember seeing our other dog (didn't kill this one) staggering around on the floor as this strange person carried me out of the house.  This person carried me through the back sliding glass door and placed me on the ground and told me not to move.  I remember feeling extremely dizzy.. I guess back then I was so little I didn't think much of it.  A few minutes later, this stranger came out the door carrying my sister.  Then after he set her down and went back in, I saw the door open back up and the dog went flying out the door.  I remember sitting there wondering what was going on, it was at the end of November and very cold.  About the time my sister and I had decided to get up and try to see what was going on, the door opened back up and several blankets came sailing out the door.  He then looked at us, and told us to sit down and don't get up.  More to come....
