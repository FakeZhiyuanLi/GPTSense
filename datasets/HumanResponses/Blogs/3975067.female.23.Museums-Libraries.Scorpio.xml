      This bag has been on the back burner for so long... so I decided to pick it up this morning and finish the back panel while watching  urlLink Ned Kelly .  (The movie is pretty good, btw)   I am working this in Red Heart TLC in Cranberry.  The color in the picture is more pink than it is in real life.  I decided to add a few more stiches to make the bag wider, so I accomendating that with a larger gusset.  I am going to use a contrasting royal blue color for the pocket and stiches on the front.  I hope to get to this soon.  I also bought some remnant fabric with which I will line the bag.       Also, I was getting some complaints from the kitty department that they were not getting the attention they deserved in this blog, so I want you to meet Quincy and Rusty.

      Bella really does not like the camera for some reason, but today I snapped a pretty good one of her!       Jenny, on the other hand, is very photogenic...

      Work was hard today... had to say goodbye to two good friends.  Both are moving away, and it happened that both of them had the same last day.  So, I needed a pick-me-up.  When I got home, there was a package with the beautiful  urlLink Colinette  Point 5.  I ordered it from  urlLink eBay  last week!  So, the yarn gave me a smile.       Wow, this stuff is beautiful.  I just need to figure out what to make with it...

      Well, I finished it... my first real sweater.  It is WAY too big for me, the sleeves go over my hand, but I don't care, because this is a landmark!  Since it was my first sweater, I knew there were going to be mistakes... so I went cheapo on the yarn.  I used LB Homespun--I don't remember the colorway.  Whatever it was, it was $2 a skein at JoAnn's, so that was enough to make me buy it. I started out using a pattern, but then I scrapped it.  I did not like where it was headed, so about 7 or 8 inches up in back, I went my own way.  Does this make it my own design?    It is a nice comfy "around the house" sweater.  My favorite thing about it is the improvised boatneck.  I cannot believe it turned out so well.

      I wanted to introduce my puppies to everyone... meet Jenny (r) and Bella (l).  Bella decided to play shy and shut her eyes on every shot.  This is the best one I could come up with!

      Who does not love a good sale?  I happened into my local Michaels today hoping for just that... and I found it!  They had  urlLink LB Fisherman's Wool  for $5.00 / skein.  I cleared out their stash (5 skeins in all) and I am planning a great kool-aid dyeing project this weekend.  There is a nice tutorial on  urlLink Craftster  and I particularly like her green and blue.  After I dye it, I have enough to make something substantial, but I may just make small gifty things too.  Perhaps felted bags or slippers... to be decided.  One of the best things about working in the library (specifically the Interlibrary Loan dept.) is that I can order books from all over the country.  I have been sampling a great number of books lately.  With the new Knitting "Renaissance", several books have come out, and there are some great ones. Some of my favorites:      Weekend Knitting  by Melanie Falick There are some amazing designs in this book.  I picked it up and with just a flip of the pages, I knew that I needed to purchase it.  Each design is presented with several pictures.  Many different skill levels are represented.  I have not knit a pattern from this book yet, however, all the patterns seem to be very well-written and easy to understand.  Cannot wait to have my own copy.      Knitting on the Edge  by Nicky Epstein There are 350 designs in this book.  The possibilities are endless!  Organized by ribs, ruffles, fringes, and other structures these details are laid out on full sized pages with large color photographs.  Each is accompanied by a clear pattern.  There is a special decorative edge for everyone in this book--beginner to advanced, no one will be disappointed.         Hot Knits  by Melissa Leapman This recently published book (June 2004) has a lot to offer.  There is something for all levels of knitters, and some very stylish designs.  The usual fare: sweaters, cardigans, tanks... but it is still a fun book that any knitter will enjoy.

      I am simply in love with  urlLink Colinette ... and I recently bought a skein of  urlLink Giotto  in the Gauguin colorway.  Since I could only afford one skein at the time, I wanted to make something special with it.    Simple stockinette on large needles--I wanted the yarn to be the star of the show.     Here is a detail... unfortunately the camera did not capture the sheen of the ribbon.    And in other news, here is my new project.       It is a poncho with  urlLink Patons Divine  mohair blend.  Holding two strands together, and using US50 needles, this is knitting up very fast.  I hope to post a finished picture before too long.

      Well, I was a little depressed when the first entry I wrote the other night was eaten by the computer, so I had to wait and cool the flames before I could repost.&nbsp;   Kris and I went over to my parents' house last night for a belated birthday party for my sister.&nbsp; She was in Azerbijan for the last five weeks, and we missed her birthday... I gave her some things before she left, but I knit up a quick scarf at Kris's hockey game the other night, and wrapped that up for her too.&nbsp; It was the&nbsp; urlLink Trendsetter Savvy  chenille/eyelash in a blue/green colorway.&nbsp; The yarn is quite nice and knits up so fast.  Here it is one me... I want to get one with her in it...

      We just got back from taking Jenny and Bella on a walk... You would think that a walk is the best thing that ever happened to them.              And while we were on the walk, Rusty and Quincy held down the fort.               ...and, in unrelated news... Look at these yummy tomatoes!   They are so big and leafy, you can hide behind them (here is Kris doing just that)    Yeah, so not really any knitting news to report, other than I am still working on the other sleeve of the cabled sweater.  This one is going faster!

      Day 2 of the Project Kool-Aid did not involve any actual dyeing, but it did involve drying!  My yarn took forever to dry... even after most of the day outside (Maryland humidity could have something to do with that, though!).  For the skeins that were completely dry, I started the winding process.      I need to repaint my toes...   I find this process pretty relaxing and I get to see the multitones in the yarn.  I think it should knit up quite nicely.  As I was surfing around other knitting blogs, I noticed many people had the same design that I had--one of the regular Blogger templates.  So, daring to be different, I created something a little different with the argyle theme in the background, nothing special or really technical, but more of a personal touch.  I hope it does not make anyone's eyes cross... Let me know if it is too busy! :)  I also finished the neverending sleeve... wow, this thing took forever!  I don't really know why either.     So, here is the sweater so far...    One more sleeve (I hope this one goes faster) and the neckband and we are DONE!   Thanks to everyone who checked out my blog and my Kool-Aid yarns!  I really appreciated your comments!

      I woke up early this morning, and started the day by joining  urlLink Project Kool-Aid , where the participants post their progress and creativity with Kool-Aid dyed yarn.  I had never dyed yarn before, and I was really looking forward to it after I picked up the skeins of wool on clearance a few weeks ago!  After buying my supplies (32 packets of mix, and a baster), I started on the project! (These are abbreviated steps--please check  urlLink here  for the full directions!)      Wind 'em up...    ...into hanks...    ...and put into a large stainless steel pot and soak for 20-30 minutes...    ...and prepare your dye mix (these are Strawberry Lemonade and Lemon Lime).    Put yarn in pot and stir immediately and watch it change colors!    Here is the first skein (drying phase)    ... and here is all of the first batch (2 8 oz. skeins)...    ... and I was a little more experimental with the second batch.    Overall, I am really happy with how they turned out!  My favorites are the purples and the reddish pinks.  Those colors take the dye best.  My little orange/yellow/green creation was completely experimental... I am still not decided whether I like it.  I tried some different techniques, like gradation, which may be evident in the above pictures.  I like the effect.  If you want to know what flavors (colors) I used, drop me a line, and I will try to remember! :)    I still have one and a half skeins that I will dye in the near future.  I want to pick up a blue color (I could not find one at Safeway!) and make at least two hanks with that.    I plan to make some felted things with these revitalized yarns--but I don't know what yet.  Anyone have an especially great felted item to tell me about?

      I have been thinking of future projects, and I was looking at some patterns online and in mags/books.  I have such a difficult time deciding what I want.  Sometimes I absolutely fall in love with the yarn, and then try to figure out what to make with it... and other times I see the pattern and then seek out the yarn, or try to see if something in my stash will do the job.    I am planning on making this sweater for Kris    and this cardigan for me, (bad picture out of the  urlLink Fall FCEK )    but I did not plan to buy the yarn yet...   HOWEVER, I stopped by Michaels to pick up one pair of 17s and use my 40% off coupon... lo and behold, huge sale... lots of yarn and notions... and I walked out with all of this...   Notice that I did get the needles...  So, the tally is:    2 skeins of  urlLink Chunky USA  (green and red Christmas stuff for the nieces)  2 skeins of  urlLink Chenille Thick and Quick  (undecided)  7 skeins of  urlLink Wool-Ease  (for the cardi above)  7 skeins of  urlLink Bernat Denim Style (for the Kris pullover)  Fall 2004  urlLink Vogue Knitting International  (great issue!)  Boye size 17 aluminum needles  Boye row counters (Bella ate my other one!)    Some sleeve progress to report... a lot slower than the front and back...    Now I am off to read the new  urlLink Vogue Knitting !

      So I received my new issue of  urlLink Lucky , and there are so many great knits on the fall forecast.  The front page of the Lucky website features a cute cardigan with a nice satin ribbon around the collar.  I love that little ribbon, and I am thinking about working some ribbon into some of my knits.  You can see some cool stuff on their site, but I also took some pictures of my favorite knit-related things in the magazine. It is a great issue if you want to check it out! There were too many to scan in, but here are the highlights.  There is a layout on vests and the mag includes some runway shots, but here are three that I liked:          urlLink Capelets   Not huge, but may take a few seconds to load...   urlLink Cardigans   I saw a similar pattern on  urlLink Digital Yarn .     ...And on my knitting needles...  the sleeves of the  urlLink Cable Sweater .  I rushed through the front and back of that sweater, but I am going a little slower on the sleeves.  I should be done soon though.

      The front of cable sweater is complete!  I was on a knitting marathon this weekend.  So, within one week, I did back, front, and half of one sleeve.  I am not trying to race through it, I just had more free time than usual.      I noticed that it looks a little uneven in this shot, but it matches up in the stitches, so all is well.      Jen is making sure I did it right.  The weekend was very nice and relaxing.  I already mentioned that I had a lot of free time.  We did our obligatory parental visits this weekend (no, it was fun, it just always seems so routine since they live in the same town) on Saturday.  On Sunday, I drove about an hour north of my town to meet someone I met through one of my favorite sites,  urlLink BookCrossing.com .  We had a nice chat, and planted some books in the cafe where we met.  When I got home, Kris had a nice lunch ready!  We hung out for the rest of the afternoon and then headed to Kris' hockey game.  Another successful game--they won 5 to 3.  Kris got some points for assists, but no goals this time.  Since his team has only lost 2 games this season, they are the first place in the division.  The playoffs start next week!   I just dropped a load of money paying my tuition for grad school in the fall.  I am glad to have that out of the way!  I am really looking forward to this semester.  Since I graduated from college in 2002, I have been taking German classes, but this time I will really be going back to class, in a program track... lots of homework, lectures, and then more homework.  Yet, I am so very excited!  *nerdy Lolly*  Unfortunately, I will not be taking any history classes this semester, only Library Science.      Rare Books Librarianship  (This is my focus)  Organization of Information (Required class)  German (Excited! Ich liebe Deutsch!)

      I always like to catch up on my shows on Saturday mornings (namely  urlLink The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ... I often have to put the needles down because I am laughing so hard!).  I started the front of the cable sweater, and I really like the way it is turning out.      Detail shot:    Sure, it is simple, but I like the  bold  statement!  The color of the yarn is a little weird in both shots.  I think the color is more periwinkle in natural light.  Hopefully one of the pictures will convey the true color.  Looks like it will be another glorious day in Maryland--we have the windows open!  Here is Jenny being happy--I love how you can see her tail wagging.  In the background you can see our HUGE tomatoes and our abundance of peppermint.  We love our garden!    Happy Saturday everyone!

      Today was such a gorgeous day... it was not humid, and there was a light breeze.  I think it was in the low 70s.  It was just beautiful!  I love it when I can put on a cardigan or a light pullover and not be overheated.    So, obviously I am looking forward to fall.  Here are some other reasons why:   urlLink  Scarf Style   (Release date: September 28th)   urlLink  25 Bags to Knit   (Release date: October 1st)   urlLink  Stitch 'n Bitch Nation   (Release date: November 4th)   urlLink  Knit Wit   (Release date: October 1st)  ...I am sure there are many others that are coming out.  Knitting has become so popular, and fall is the prime time to get those new patterns out!  Let me know if there are any new books that you are looking forward to!  It just so happens that I have a fall birthday... how convienient.  And in other knitting news, I have completed the back of the cable sweater, and started the front.  Kris and I have been watching taped episodes of  urlLink Six Feet Under  (wow, I love that show...) and I have been knit-knit-knitting away.  Will post a picture when you can clearly see the cable.

      On a recent trip to Michaels, I saw this new  urlLink Patons  yarn, Cha Cha.  When I saw it, I knew that it was perfect for my nieces.  It is the kind of fluorescent eyelash that only little girls can get away with... I would have loved this stuff when I was a kid.  I found a  urlLink great pattern  on  urlLink Joann.com  and started knitting away on K's cardigan.  I think she will love it!     I bought the yarn for M's cardigan the other day... I want to give the cardigans to them in October (both of their birthdays are in October) and the weather will be perfect at that time of year for this little garment.  Here is the colorway for M's...    ... and another picture of an unfinished object.  I have a feeling this one will take awhile.  The needles are small, and the yarn splits pretty easily, but I  love  the color (kind of a cobalt blue).  Maybe that will be enough for me to keep knitting... It is the beginnings of the  urlLink SnB Little Black Top .

      My mom bought me some fun eyelash yarn on her recent trip, and I was thinking of something to make with it... so I came up with the idea of a neck warmer / ear warmer combo.  It turned out pretty well.  I knit the eyelash ( urlLink Schachenmayr Brazilia ) with a viscose ( urlLink Cascade Fiesta ).  It is hard to see in the picture, but it is very nice when you see close up.         Neck Warmer version      Ear Warmer version     ...and I wanted to test the new yarn  urlLink Patons Divine ... so I knit up a quick scarf on US35.  I really like this mohair blend yarn--and there are some beautiful colors in the collection.

      After three days of no internet (ahh!) I am back with some nice progress on my SnB cable sweater.  I really like the way that this one is shaping out with the raglan sleeves, etc.  My hope is that this one will fit a lot better than my previous burlap sack sweater incident.  (Okay, so it is not that bad, but I have to kvetch a little about it!)  Work totally sucked today, so I was so ready to get home, take my pictures and post to my blog!  Without any further ado, here is the near complete back of the cable sweater (I too am looking forward to the cable on the front).      It was another hot day in Maryland, and Bella has decided that the best way to cool off it to sit on the air vent!  Here she is "chilling out"...

      Yeah, so I like to knit a lot of stuff... I start something, set it down and do not come back right away.  I had been sitting on this Zeeby bag (below) for about 6 weeks, and just started on it again this weekend.    Anyway, I started my next project!  It is also from  urlLink Stitch 'N Bitch .  It just so happens that I am doing two patterns from this book... believe, I like other stuff too! I have amassed quite a "to knit list" in the past few months of serious knitting.   So, this is my first cable garment.  I have practiced the technique quite a bit, and I am ready to make the leap.  Kris' mother got some nice  urlLink Caron  acrylic yarn for me last Christmas that I was just waiting to use.  When I saw this pattern, I knew it would work nicely.  I was able to knit to gauge without changing needles or anything.  This is the back of the garment, so you won't see the cable there... that will come soon!              So, a little progress.  I like the way it is turning out.  Other knitting news:  I am adding to my knitting library.  Here are my two most recent acquisitions...     The  Animal Knits  book has some great intarsia patterns for kids sweaters/blankets, etc.  I have not tackled intarsia yet, but this book will be great fun when I learn it.    Rowan's  It's a Tape Thing  has some great designs in it.  I will have to alter some of the patterns to fit me properly in the bust, but I am up for the challenge...

      Kris always has hockey games on Sundays and I love to go and watch him play.  I always bring my knitting along.  I like how I can bring a sweater along to wear inside the rink, even though it is about 90 degrees outside!  I love living in Maryland, but I seriously hate the weather here.  I really wish it could be more mild.  The humidity is the thing that bothers me the most though!  I took along the gusset for the SnB Zeeby bag.  I am about 30 inches in, and I need to get to 52". (I made mine bigger than the pattern calls for).    So, they ended up winning 9-3! Kris got 2 goals and 3 assists.
