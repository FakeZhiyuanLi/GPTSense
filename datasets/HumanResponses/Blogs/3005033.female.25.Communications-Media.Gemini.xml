      ...Happy Birthday to you!  Well, there are two people getting older out there as we speak.  Today (the 30th) was Matt's 26th birthday, and tomorrow (the 31st) is the legendary Dr. Ravi Thamburaj's 27th birthday.  (Yeah right, Ravi...more like 127.)  Since it always helps to visualize people having a happy birthday (?) here's a nice oversized picture of each of them.    (Matty and some girl)    (Ravi's the one in the OSU jersey, for all 4 people on earth unfortunate enough not to know the good Doctor.  I don't know any of the other losers in the picture.)

      ...and Scotty Crowe. (his Megan to my Brooke, or vice versa.)  Dear John, (and Scotty)  Was it Kirkegaard, or John Lennon who said, "You say goodbye, and I say hello...hello, hello.  I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello?"    I'll cut to the chase.  Are you avoiding us?  Is it something we did?  We've been friends for some time now (and by "friends," I of course am referring to that time we spoke for twelve minutes on the street last June, and our subsequent dates.  And by "dates," I mean the time we passed you outside of a club, and the time we saw you at Justin's post-VMA concert --I was the one in the hat-- and the time we saw you at Madison Square Garden --I was the one in section 122...in the hat.-- and I just wanted to see if there's anything we need to talk about.  You can't just up and give the cold shoulder to someone in your band like that.  (And by "in your band," I am of course referring to the fact that I can play poor renditions of two of your songs on my guitar in my room along with your CD.)    We tried to see you at the China Club, and you wouldn't even make eye contact (by that I mean we didn't get in).  Then you play on David Letterman last night, and don't even call.  What's up with that?  Since when do you not call to tell us where you'll be holding our backstage passes?  Honestly...not cool, dude.  If you have a crush on Taylor, I would hope you'd just shoot us straight.  Do you not think we'd support you?  Seriously, I just wish you would let us know the motivation behind this awkward silence between us.    We might stop into Suede tonight, and if we run into you, then maybe we can talk about this over a Tom Collins.  I know they're you're favorite.  Maybe we can ditch the club and go to a nice Subway (I have a card for a free cookie, which I will gladly split with you) and just catch up.  Scotty can come, too.  You still owe us a coffee, you know.  Don't go making Scotty pay for it...we know you pull down decent bucks.  Spring for the Venti size for us tonight.  We'll see you there.  I hope this is the end of "drama"...I composed a poem about it, which I will leave you to think about.  "My stupid mouth has got me in trouble I said too much again to a date (that's you) over dinner yesterday (in June.) And I could see, he was offended he said "Well, anyway...." just dying for a subject change.  Oh, just another social casualty score one more for me how could I forget mama (Carole says hi, btw) said think before speaking no filter in my head Oh what's a girl to do? I guess she'd better find one soon."   Think about it.  Love, Brooke

      ...part deux.  So, this was never meant to be a recurring segment.  HOW in the he-yell do we miss John Mayer again and again?  I mean, we live in the same city.  To add insult to serious injury, he played Letterman last night (an easy and free stand-by ticket to get) and what did I have on the docket yesterday?  NOTHING!!!  I had nothing.  This is starting to have an ominous, distinctly "NSync chronic near-miss" quality to it.  Our friend Taylor calls and leaves the following message on Meg's voicemail.  I have paraphrased..here's the cut-to-the-chase version.  "Hey, Meg, it's Taylor...on my way....to the John Mayer show at Hammerstein Ballroom (in Manhattan)...got a ticket from my friend at MTV....I'll tell your boyfriend you said hi!"  Ok, if any of you ever do that to me, you can find a new hip, funny friend to keep you entertained.  Because WE will no longer be colleagues....we will be better classified as "mortal enemies."    So yeah, it might be time for an open letter to John Mayer. Hold please.

      Special "We're the worst John Mayer fans EVER edition!  "ARGGHHHHHHHHHH!!! I am ripping and tearing my clothes! I'm in sackcloth!" --Megan, listening to her voicemail revealing that we missed the third NYC John Mayer show in ten days.   and later....   Me: Maybe John Mayer will be at Suede.  Or Joey and Lance.  They're in town. Megan:  I don't think God likes us anymore.  He has forsaken us.  We never    see ANYONE!!! Me: You saw Kevin Bacon in the park yesterday. Megan: (in an uproar) KEVIN BACON CAN KISS MY ASS!!! I don't CARE about Kevin Bacon!

      ...these are a few of my favorite things.  I was thinking tonight about the small things that can make even a terrible day bearable, and a good day great.  Not the kind of favorite things that you often talk about, like movies (The Royal Tenenbaums) or songs (Worlds Apart--Jars of Clay)..but just the little things that we often take for granted.  I thought I would list a few of mine, in an effort to inspire you to think of some of yours.  I am really thankful for my life.  -Friends that you can not talk to in months or years, but immediately converse as if no time has passed.  Whenever I talk to Sarah Hogue, I feel this way.  She is always excited to hear from me, and was totally up for buying and delivering a cake to Matt tomorrow for his birthday even though she doesn't know him.  Just because she loves me and is a good friend.  (And maybe she wants to get a look at him, haha.)  At any rate, true friends, even the ones you don't talk to that often.  -Hangouts that you can feel totally at home in...a place you go repeatedly.  Donkey coffee in Athens, Ohio is like this for me.  Up in NYC, DT/UT coffee is becoming the same way.  At home, this is totally The Mountaineer Family Restaurant and Don Emilio's.  Places you don't feel rushed. Good lighting, good music, good art, friendly people.  It's nice to walk in somewhere and recognize a few faces, especially in a city full of strangers.  -That feeling when you have a floor ticket to a concert and you get to walk past everyone sitting in the nosebleed sections to get down the stairs to your seat.  It's probably mean, but I'm always thinking, "See ya, SUCKERS!"...It's definitely a rush to see how many people you have better seats than.  Also, the moment in a concert where the artist appears onstage and begins the first song.  Or your favorite song.    -Waiting for weeks or months for a CD to come out, buying it the night it comes out, rushing home and tearing the shrinkwrap off, and listening to the whole album without hitting skip, rewind, or pause in the complete darkness.  To me, that is complete satisfaction...the music has a newness that it never will again as your ears learn the songs, you hear them more honestly that first time.  -Seeing a horrible movie with terrific people.  Somehow Charlie's Angels 2 was amazing with Megan, because we only paid 5 bucks and we were the only people in the theatre (another favorite) so we could be loud and make fun of Cameron Diaz.  Mona Lisa Smile was a joy to sit through because Matt was sitting next to me, and making the same comments I was thinking.  -Getting a real-live letter or package in the mail, especially if you didn't know it was coming.  Sarah Filipiak sent me a three page update on her life and encouragement note a month or so ago, and it was the highlight of my whole week.  I felt very loved and remembered, and also was glad to know what was going on in her life, since I'm ten hours away.  -Roadtrips.  Period.  Plane or train trips count too, I guess, but mostly roadtrips.  Any and all, especially now that I don't have a car.  There's something so peaceful about watching the world pass by a highway at a time, with good music and loved ones.  And usually a fun destination to look forward to...I think most people that read this blog have been on some form of roadtrip with me, and agree with this sentiment.  My dream is to sometime in the next five years rent an RV for a week or so and just go with my friends on a tour of the US, wherever we decide to get up and go that day.   It almost happened a couple summers ago...maybe it's still in the stars.  -The feeling of getting a really good laugh in a sketch, especially if you wrote the joke.    -The feeling of paying off a bill once and for all.  It's funny how having one less thing to worry about can change your whole countenance.  -Having a day with NO plans.  This doesn't happen a lot, but usually when I go home there's at least one day when I look at Matt and go, "Hey, you know what we have to do today?" and he joyfully replies "NOTHING!" and then we watch Teen Wolf or something and eat cookies all day.  There is a deliciousness in not being productive once in a while, and just enjoying wherever you happen to be.  -Hot showers that last so long you sort of space out until you snap to and go "How long have I been in here?  I look like a California Raisin!"  -Finding a REALLY amazing find at a Thrift/Vintage store, or finding a really amazing thrift/vintage store to begin with.  You know what I'm talking about:  you pull out that Hall and Oates T-shirt from the bottom of the bargain bin and wonder how its been overlooked.  People around you give you bitter jealous looks as you proceed triumphantly to the cash register with your dollar.  (Ok, so I have never found a Hall and Oates T-shirt in my size, but its an example.  If you do find a size Small, please send it along.  Get the dollar from  urlLink Ben Scragg ...he owes me.)  -Waking up in a panic, only to realize you don't have to get up for at LEAST another hour.  -Spending a gift certificate...such a great feeling, like a little mini shopping spree.  It's guilt free shopping, because it's not like you can say, "Ooh, I should save this to pay bills."  It's only good one place, and its usually somewhere fun.  -Being told you're pretty by a stranger. Especially when they're not trying to hit on you.  It's always good to hear from a more objective source than your BFF's.  Is that vain?  Probably.  Am I vain?  Certainly.  -The feeling of coming home, in any and every sense of the word home.  I get this feeling when I drive into Belpre, Athens, come through the door of my parents' house in Belpre, Stroud's Run, coming into Matt's apartment in Columbus, the Scragg's home, the Mountaineer, even my apartment here in NYC.  Seeing Fair Choir friends always perpetuates this feeling, or Campus Crusade functions at OU.  It's nice to step into a comfort zone for a little bit.  I don't recommend comfort zones as habitats, they stagnate growth...but we all need to re-group from time to time, and it's good to just feel welcomed and completely comfortable somewhere, like its where you belong.  So much of the world doesn't give off that vibe, so its good to visit the places that do.  -wearing your favorite pair of underwear...or even your whole favorite outfit.  yum.  Those are all I can think of for the moment...what are yours? IM or email me.  brookeawilliams@hotmail.com ...I will post them.  Until next time, may tomorrow be filled with lots of your favorites.  Make it a point to incorporate one or two into your schedule ASAP.

      ...Brookelyn's "Best of the Web" awards  Tonight's installment of Webbed Feat comes to us from Minnesota.  A blog of sorts, you might even say.  I stumbled across this gem quite randomly.  I was trying to decide on a good blog topic, and decided to check out a couple of the most recently posted blogs (an option on the frontpage of  urlLink blogspot.com ).  One site was a girl who talked a lot about photographing indie rock bands..it was a mostly boring site, except for the generous list of links to the side.  We're talking about a LOT of Pop Culture links.  Mojo magazine, the official  urlLink BRMC  site ....lots of stuff that I felt cool even recognizing.  I am like the littlest giant in the Pop Culture world sometimes.  One link was simply titled "Rock Snobs."  I ventured in.  I feel compelled to warn you that the tendency is to see a link and hastily click on it out of curiousity.  DO NOT DO THIS to  urlLink this  link.  You must evaluate if you have the time to spend at least an hour in this man's world.  If not, don't bother, because it is as fascinating as a car wreck.  A man (28) stuck in a series of temp jobs seems to have four or five colleagues in similar stations of life surrounding him in at least a marginally social setting.  He does seem to be true to his word in being a Rock Snob, but not in the way one might imagine.  He doesn't spend his days prattling on about obscure bands only 19 hipsters in the world are cool enough to know about like Robyn Hitchcock or the Brian Jonestown Massacre.  You get the feeling that this guy KNOWS every band that has ever existed, but he keeps his posts in Pop Culture layman's terms, sticking to the canon of household names.  He has one of the funniest "print voices" I've ever come across, at least for an amateur.  In short, this means he can make you laugh out loud while your roommate is sleeping.  I read maybe 15 of his entries last night, and from what I can make out, the main theme seems to be his distaste for three or four bands that leads him to a sadistic obsession with them, like watching a car crash. These topics include: Chubby Checker, Bruce Dickinson, Poison, Ratt, and the Doors.    You need to experience how funny obsessive compulsive disorder can be when paired with an unlimited knowledge for Pop Culture.   urlLink READY TO WASTE AN HOUR?  If you're really pressed for time, stick to the Chubby Checker themed material...it's the cream of the crop.  Sigh...I really wish Matt's cell phone wasn't a piece of not-working crap.  He'd appreciate all the elitist references to Ronnie James Dio, Megadeth, and Deep Purple more than anyone.  Someone in Columbus, please go over there and wake him up to read this.  After all, us Rock Snobs have got to stick together.  ADDENDUM:  On the way to  urlLink church  today,  urlLink Megan  and I passed this kid on the street who was maybe 13.  He had that "I'm JUST developing my own style" kind of feel to him, like last year he was wearing whatever mom laid out for him, but realized that was lame and is now trying out the thrift store and buying vinyl for the first time.  Anycrap, he was wearing a black Pink Floyd T-Shirt.  It was actually pretty quality, I should have offered to buy him a pack of cigarettes for it or something.  So as we go by, I go "Oh, Shine on, you crazy diamond" (Referencing the Floyd title by the same name).   I say this with a sarcastic tear in my eye, like I'm so proud of the little ankle-biter for being down. Megan doubles over laughing, and I am proud of my  urlLink Pink Floyd  reference.  She then reveals that she thought I made it UP.  I really like that she thinks I'm capable of that kind of randomness...some kid walks by, and I pull the phrase "Shine on you crazy diamond" out of my crack.  It's also maybe the first time in my life that I have ever made a classic/prog rock reference, in that I'm just discovering 1967-1977 this month.  I think I'll go to the Goodwill and buy a Zeppelin shirt to celebrate.  Or the Who...or Pink Floyd.  Or maybe I'll just beat up that kid and take his shirt, and he can go back to listening to Usher like he probably was 6 months ago.  I'm a jerk.

      ...Boys say, boys say.   Why do guys (probably not any of the guys who read this blog, but guys in general as a gender) feel the need to yell catcalls at women passing by?  My favorite variation on this is when they honk at you or roll down their wondow while passing in a car.  This is usually accompanied by some sort of "hey baby" or the Hispanic variation, "hey mami" or the Black variation, "hey shorty."   I don't think There is an Asian variation,...at least, I have never seen two asian guys rolling in their Hyundai and screaming out lewd comments to passers-by.  Now that I think of it, I kind of wish I  would  see that.   What is the expectation there?  I just cannot figure out why men think this is an efficient use of their time.  What do they think is going to happen?  I can't imagine there is a man delusional enough to actually believe a woman could be turned on by this.  I really get the feeling that in their minds, they're like "I'm going to roll down my window and whistle, and she's going to run over here and have sex with me.  Right here in the intersection.  She's going to hop into my '91 El Dorado and we're going to get..it..on."  If they didn't believe that at least in part, why would they waste all the time of rolling down the window and making a big scene?  I welcome your thoughts...until I get a guestbook (I'm working on it, Jessi) you can IM them to me at NYCBrookelyn or email me at  urlLink brookeawilliams@hotmail.com  ... or just roll down your windows and shout them at me suggestively.

      ...sigh.  Have you ever been at work, with a vague annoyance or dissatisfaction for your workplace buzzing around in your mind as always, when the dam of discontentment breaks ?  A child starts crying...someone yells at you for shorting them on jimmies...something.  Suddenly, you realize that you don't "sort of dislike" your job, you absolutely despise it.  You want to burn it to the ground like Milton burnt down Initech.  I hit the wall tonight.  I think Megan has hit the wall too at "The Crew." In fact, I think a lot of that might be going around.  It's not so much the job itself...I have good managers and co-workers, and I do get to sing for tips, which in some tiny way classifies as being in my field.  (You really have to squint to see it qualifying.)  I even got a promotion of sorts recently...I will be Entertainment Director, which means standing by the door, passing out menus and telling people about the company.  Sort of a hostess meets PR kind of thing.  Schmoozing trumps mixing like a full house trumps two pair.  Also, I am in the best shape of my life, from lugging 20 pound boxes of ice cream mix and whatnot up and down the stairs.  I have arm muscles for the first time ever.  I don't know what to do with them.  Mostly I look at them a lot in the mirror going "ooh, ahh."     SIDEBAR: Customers are programmed to say only three things in line...  -"Wow, you guys probably don't even need a gym membership, heh-heh!" -"I'll bet you all get quite a workout, huh?  You have great arm muscles, heh-heh!" (We wear polo shirts, they can't even see our arm muscles.) -"Where are my damn jimmies?!?"  So long story short, I need a break, and not of the industry standard 30-minute variety.  Let the flurry of resume/cover letters commence.  Does anyone know the best way to get a letter to Justin Timberlake regarding a position as "Entourage member #6" or "Trucker hat wrangler?"  I hear those positions might be open...

      In a recent blog, I addressed extreme reactions viewers have had to  The Passion of the Christ . True to my word, I did some research and came up with the following addendum to my report on the official emergency protocol at Regal Cinemas.  BenjamScragg: there is no protocol for how to handle dying or deceased patrons, but we can put extra butter flavor topping on your popcorn at no additional charge.   That's because the Regal Beagle cares, folks.  You don't get that kind of personal attention to the deceased at Loew's.  At AMC they'll charge the dead body an additional 10.25 if they insist on taking up the seat for the next showing of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.

      ...take my hand, we'll make it, I swear.  Whoa, whoa.  So a few days ago I write an entry called "Blogging off steam," basically denouncing middle-class poverty and all its stresses.  I fantasized about what I would do with five thousand dollars.  I also said that I was going to pray for God to drop this amount in my lap over the coming months, on top of my normal income.  After I published that, I began to reflect on my own words (because, like most vain people, i like the sound of my own voice) and decided that even one thousand dollars would significantly change my life.  Five thousand would be nice, but only one thousand or so of the things I listed are needs in the truest sense of the word.  So I asked God to bring an amount between 1ooo and 5000 dollars (or yen...let me check the exchange rate and get back to you.)  In the last week, I have had a friend send me a surprise care package containing fifty dollars of groceries...the creditor to whom I owe the most has offered to half my balance and consider the entire balance paid...my boss at work offered me at least two additional hours this week at work...and my parents have cheerfully offered to send money.  Total so far: At LEAST 550 dollars.  Out of the blue, from God and people that He works through.  The moral: nothing is too big or too small for God to care about. I have every confidence that even more jaw-dropping things are to come...stay tuned. (It's like the dramatic conclusion to a two-part after-school special...you know everything will work out in the end.)

      So, by now,  The Passion of the Christ  has become a bigger 2004 story than even Britney's Vegas Marriage.  Every writer, critic, tv personality, celebrity, medium to large-sized dog, and some robots have thrown in their two cents worth about this film.  You can't turn on the television or open a magazine without being bombarded by commentary about  The Passion of the Christ.   I'll admit that I still haven't seen it, mostly for fiscal reasons.  Also, I am slightly daunted by making such an emotional investment...I remember coming out of "Saving Private Ryan" a few years ago and backing out of post-movie plans because I had that "I just took the ACT's" feeling of being drained on every imaginable level.  And that was just earthly war...this is the crux of my faith, a movie about the ultimate spiritual battle, sacrifice, and the biggest controversy of all time.  When I come home from work lately, just watching "That 70's Show" is exhausting.  In short, I need to just suck it up and see it, since I have every confidence in the movie's importance, quality, and ability to move me.  That said, it seems to have moved several individuals in more extreme ways.  First there is the supposedly healthy middle-aged lady in Kansas who DIED from a seizure and subsequent heart attack on the film's opening day.  I mean, I LOVED the Royal Tenenbaums, but I just had a short stroke and went back to watching the movie.  There is no need to up and expire.  Granted, this movie has the sort of  Titanic -esque quality of an ending everyone's already familiar with, but that's no excuse for clocking out before the credits roll.  I feel badly for the part-time popcorn sweeper-upper that had to deal with the aftermath.  I'm sure there's no protocol in the Regal Cinemas employee Welcome Packet that indicates the proper way to deal with a deceased movie-goer.  (I will fact-check this with Ben Scragg.)  He or she is probably chagrined enough to be working somewhere that requires a uniform similar to that of an old-time bellhop, and does not need the added diress of wondering if it's okay to start sweeping while the coroner is still there.   The second Passion-inspired event that I found amusing occured in Florida.  A man robbed a bank two years ago, got away with the crime, and was living large in the Sunshine state.  (Or the Citrus state, the Archipelago state, whatever Florida's nickname is these days.)  He saw TPOTC, and immediately decided to turn himself in.  According to authorities, he also strongly urged the detective on the case to see the film.   Following that logic, I wonder if the movie "The Italian Job" inspired him to go to church...  The last one is my favorite. (Other than my previously posted comment about Brandon Smith wanting to go theater-hopping after viewing it...that's by FAR my favorite because Brandon is a) a strong believer, b) 24 years of age, and c) completely not joking.)  There's no way I can do it justice, you'll just have to read about it  urlLink here.   So, in conclusion...happy movie-going.  Be passionate, just don't...you know..die.  Or stab someone.  Or rob a bank.  (Theater-hop at your own risk and discretion.)

      ...then why isn't Michael Jackson black again?  I have spent WAY too much of today in the throes of obscure 80's Popular Culture.  Allow me to thrust some items back into the public consciousness.  (I almost typed pubic consciousness.  That would have been embarrassing, because I don't even know what that entails.)  AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THINGS YOU FORGOT ARE AWESOME (non-exhaustive, and in no particular order)   Teeny Little Super Guy --Sesame Street  This little fella appeared in some short film segments of Sesame Street.  Very few people remember him, but those who do recall tlsg remember him with great affection.  He was basically a cartoon man that lived on the side of a real glass (think Roger Rabbit cartoon-on-reality) in a kitchen somewhere.  He would slide around the Formica countertop and help his utensil and glasswear friends out of any jam they might be having.  He wasn't so much a super HERO as just a super  guy .  At the end of the segment, he'd roll himself back into the lazy susan where he lived.  Here's a visual aid.     Typewriter Guy --Sesame Street  More of you might recall this little dude, who wheeled himself out into view whistling, and then typed a letter onto his paper.  He would say the letter, and sometimes demonstrate a word beginning with that letter, usually at his peril.  For example, if he were to type "R", he would wheel himself over to a nearby rabid dog.  He would provoke the wild dog (I don't remember how, maybe by typing rude things) and say "R.  Rabid dog." and then the dog would chase and maim the typewriter guy.  You wouldn't so much see this violence occur as you would see the dude wheel himself the hell out of Dodge, and subsequently hear the twisting metal of a typewriter being mauled by a rabid beast.  Who ever heard of a typewriter on wheels anyway?  That's not very practical, talking machinery aside.       The Pinball Song --Sesame Street  The last Sesame Street related item I'll mention tonight is the one hardest to get out of your head.  Remember "The Pinball Song"?  It was a tool designed to teach the numbers one through twelve.  In retrospect, it was the most psychedelic thing I've ever seen in my life.  Colors and shapes I have not seen since filled the screen, while The Pointer Sisters soulfully sang "onetwothreeFOURfive, sixseveneightNINEten, eLEVentwelve," over and over again.  It's named The Pinball Song because in the segment (which should have won a VMA or something), viewers followed an animated (and again, very trippy) pinball through a maze of colors and shapes.     Fifteen/SNICK --Nickelodeon  This might have been a part of one of the early incarnations of SNICK...man, SNICK could be a whole blog entry of its own....Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Ren and Stimpy, Clarissa Explains it All, the Secret World of Alex Mack, and the best of them all, Roundhouse.  But I digress.  Fifteen was the one and only teen soap opera the channel ever attempted.  It was like everyone at Nickelodeon got really, really jealous of Degrassi Jr. High and tried their own hand at teen angst.  It...was...terrible.  But I loved it.  All I remember was a girl named Brooke who tried to ruin everyone's lives, and a black girl (she used to be Brooke's friend until they had a falling out and then became archenemies..i think), and a "rebel" named Dylan.  He threatened to quit school for half an episode so he could play guitar in his garage.  Everyone knew he was supposed to be the rebel because he wore a leather jacket.  I am of the opinion that 90210 stole the idea for "Dylan McKay."  Those bastards.  The set was awful, the acting was so monotone it made dial tones sound virtuosic, and I'm pretty sure most of the actors were Canadian. 'Nuff said.     SquareOneTelevision/3-2-1 Contact --PBS  I group these two gold nuggets because they were both produced by the Children's Television Workshop as adolescent edu-tainment (SquareOne was math; 3-2-1 Contact! was science).  I remember that Square One did a lot of music video parodies, such as "The Angle Dance" (satirizing "The Safety Dance") and "How much is One Billion?" in which one of Heavy D's Fat Boys cries out passionately, "Yo! One million ain't even one perCENT of one billion! Wow!" Oddly enough, both shows contained daily recurring segments whose legacies outshine the memory of the show itself.  With SquareOne, it was MathNet.  MathNet was a Dragnet rip-off starring James Earl Jones as the police captain.  How they got Darth Vader to stoop to doing Math comedy, I'll never know, but it was amazing.  3-2-1 Contact had The Bloodhound Gang, but I honestly don't remember a ton other than the theme song.  "Whenever there's trouble, we're there on the double, we're the bloodhound gang..." What I DO remember is how sweet that basement apartment was on 3-2-1 Contact!    I suppose I could go ahead and complete the holy trinity of PBS educational shows of that era and mention Ghostwriter.  It was the English/grammar version, only this time, there was a computer that was possessed or had a ghost in it or something, who helped kids write correctly.  I remember really liking it for some reason...but then again, I was a big dork in junior high.     Swans Crossing --Fox  Before the OC, there was SC.  This was another truly great and terrible teen soap.   And surprise, surprise, I'm pretty sure Fox was responsible.  The OC is in primetime though, whereas Swans Crossing gave Fifteen a run for its money in the 5:30 time slot.  This had one thing that Fifteen did not, which was Shane McDermott.  I was in full blown crush mode on this kid.  He starred in "Airborne," a really terrible movie that I still know every word of to this DAY (a very young Jack Black plays second-fiddle hockey bully Auggie, he's the highlight).  I can't remember which rotten egg came first, but Swans Crossing was all about a small affluent town and the life-and-death problems the toothpaste-ad teens faced there on a daily basis.  Eat your heart out Dawson's Creek.  An extremely young Sarah Michelle Gellar anchored this cast, but would probably deny it now.  Totally terrible with no redeeming qualities...WOW i would give my right kidney to have all those episodes on tape.  Here's a picture from a back issue of teen mag "Tutti Frutti" of the whole SC cast.  Please note the seal in the upper right hand corner, assuring us that it is an "OFFICIAL  PIN-UP"...there were so many black market teen magazine pin-ups on the streets during those days.  The seal was the only way to tell for sure that you were only letting the genuine article take up precious space on the interior wall of your locker.    Are there more that I'm missing?  As Patty Benatar would say, "Hit me with your best shot, fire away."

      I am really uncomfortable dating someone with better hair than me.    Note about the re-editing of this entry: I'm also uncomfortable with my inability to re-size this picture, but the link wasn't working so this is the only way.  I'm sorry it has to be like this.  Matt is NOT this large in real life.   He's much, much smaller.  Don't be alarmed.

      ...meanie.  So, we were making the best of our utter failure to see John Mayer tonight (There were no tickets, only a guest list....to date, I have no tips on scamming your way into a guest-list only show.  It's a whole other league of exclusive.) when Kaelyn dropped this IM bomb.  Kaboom. Curse. Swear. Cuss.  cavalli128: OMG. can't believe i didnt tell you this! cavalli128: lance and joey came into planet tonight cavalli128: to eat cavalli128: girls GOING crazy...screaming, insanity NYCBrookelyn: WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT???? NYCBrookelyn: what time was this? NYCBrookelyn: i just teared up cavalli128: like 8ish? cavalli128: hahahah NYCBrookelyn: OH MY GOSH cavalli128: yeah NYCBrookelyn: we were there cavalli128: in times square? NYCBrookelyn: we were standing in front of planet at 7:45 NYCBrookelyn: are you effing KIDDING ME???????????????????????????????? NYCBrookelyn: i am going to slit my throat cavalli128: they were going to sit at table 5, but then all these girls were screaming when they walked in, so andy took em to the fraight elevator and they ate in sky box a - and i think lance smiled at me, but i'm vain .... NYCBrookelyn: wait, so girls didn't know they were coming in, and just freaked out? NYCBrookelyn: like did everyone freak out, or just a couple girls? ... cavalli128: no. andy calls me over, freaking out... he's like JOEY FATONE is coming in in 35 minutes. flag something. so i'm like uh..ok. dude it's not justin, thanks. it's joey. but then LANCE shows up with him. and he's walking them back to the bar - and litearlly EVERYONE just starts screaming, and all of us are like "WHAT?! shut UP!" NYCBrookelyn: screaming like kind of trying to restrain themselves, like "oh my gosh, look who it is" NYCBrookelyn: or like "AGHHHHH!! AGHHHHHHHH! AGHHHHH!" NYCBrookelyn: and pointing and crying cavalli128: YES cavalli128: like AHHHHHH!!! AHHHHHHH! high pitched cavalli128: then sat at the f***ing tables for  a year while the line continued to grow down the stairs    Did I push an old lady down the stairs or something, God???  For crying out loud!  I thought Lance was dead; didn't he die in space?  If I saw 40 percent of NSync together in one place right now, I would have 40 percent of a stroke.

      Dear Andy and Mandy,  First of all, let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of both of you.   urlLink Andy , you are singlehandledly responsible for renewing my enthusiasm for tennis.  I enjoy your colorful displays on the court (read: cussing out umpires), and I also enjoy your newly shorn head.  I miss the fauxhawk, but this new buzz cut is a great look for summer.  Some people will say you are trying to copy Justin Timberlake, but just remember: those are the same people that said he was copying Michael Jackson, when it is  obvious  that Justin is much, much blacker than Michael, and there's really no comparing the two.   urlLink Mandy , you're just a classy lady:  I had my doubts about your potential at first, but your album Coverage was a brave effort..way to go on keeping it secret from the record company, and from stepping away from them to pursue more a more fair contract with another label.  Very anti-establishment of you, you cute little rebel!    That said, I just wanted to bring up concerns.  I'm sure you're both regular readers of my blog.  I  am  pretty interesting, and I estimate that my audience has grown well into the tens of thousands, yourselves included.  Thanks for taking time out of your hectic, A-list celebrity lives to see what craziness has invaded MY world.  Very considerate of you.  I consider us friends, cause I said "hi" to you, Mandy at the 2002  urlLink VMA awards , and Andy, I won the photo caption contest on your website.  I also saw you at the first round of last year's US Open, which you went on to win.  (Good job on that.)  I was the one in the hat.  As a friend, I was crushed to hear that you two might be parting ways as a couple!  Guys, rethink this.  You two aren't just some Andre Agassi/Brooke Shields.  YOUR NAMES RHYME.  You are the "it" couple, America's Sweethearts, the Julia Roberts of the tennis/teen pop Venn diagram intersection.    Everyone expected Britney and Justin to break up, and Bennifer was doomed from day one, before "Gigli" was ever an ill-conceived twinkle in someone's eye.  Everyone knows that Nick Lachey silently curses and cuts himself late at night for marrying lobotomy Barbie.  But you guys...you were different.  You seemed relatively normal, and I supported you for three main reasons.  1.  As I mentioned above, your names rhyme.  That is a spectastrophe. 2. Andy, You made me believe I could have a celebrity BF without hating his popstar girlfriend.  That made me feel like a grown-up. 3.  You just look so CUTE together!  I wanted to go on double dates with you, and go shopping with Mandy and get mani/pedi's while the guys went off and played basketball somewhere.   Don't let the dream die.  Find it in your publicists hearts to put you guys back together.  I am too poor to buy US Weekly for the next eight weeks to read about the messy aftermath.  If you can't make it in this crazy world, then who can?  Give us all hope that love can conquer all, including the  urlLink ATP  circuit.    Call me.  Sincerely,  Brookelyn

      ...new words for a new millenium.  Today's gem: (n.)  Spectastrophe:  1. A series of catastrophic events that fail to malign one's good mood, thus resulting in a feeling of hilarity rather than disaster. 2.  A comedic misadventure.  3.  Something so horrible it loops back around again to wonderful and interesting, like Donald Trump's hair (see: Onion Loaf).   "Brooke and Megan's attempt to get into the John Mayer show at the China Club was a total spectastrophe; they failed to get in, but had the best time doing so."

      Ok, so I thought it was disconcerting when scientists cracked open the DNA code in 2000.  A little too Orwellian, perhaps?  Then there was the robot that plays jazz on a trumpet.  Extremely unsettling.   urlLink THIS  is the final proof that the apocolypse is upon us, and we'll all be leashed to a robot master within the year.

That's not sexy." --me, waiting for John Mayer and Scotty Crowe to emerge from the China Club (with much the same ending as Waiting for Godot, or waiting for Guffman)   "I will beat drunken a-holes to death if they even come NEAR me!" --Megan's Oscar-worthy reaction to my fear of being pinched by strangers unless I wore green on St. Patrick's Day

      ...sighhhhh.  This is my new pet peeve.  If you've ever been to a  urlLink Cold Stone Creamery , you know that the entire ice cream making process there is rather "labor-intensive."  A few extra arms wouldn't hurt me, as I'm trying to mix people's ice cream creations together.  When I'm done, the proper steps to finishing the transaction are Customer, Clean, Cash, meaning hand the customer their ice cream, then scrape the stone off, and then proceed to the cash register.    The customers do not understand "the three c's"...they have their own version of this transaction, which goes less customer-clean-cash, and more like "make impatient noises--wave money in front of brooke's face even more impatiently--walk away on cell phone when appropriate paying time arrives."  I do not grasp why otherwise rational people feel the need to shove twenty dollar bills at me while i'm still making their ice cream, and am NOWHERE NEAR A CASH REGISTER.  What is the expectation there?  That I will take their money, make change out of my own pocket and send them on their way four seconds sooner?  Today, I began fantasizing about this...I would love to be able to, just once, be ready for their hasty onslaught of bills.  When the done-up lady in a fur coat comes in and jams her money in my face, I would give everything I own if I could magically open my mouth and coins would dribble out onto the counter.  Exact change, of course.  Not like, spitting coins violently, just sort of opening my mouth and they tumble out, while I look on with a detached ennui.  And then I will take her money and calmy eat it.  A more controversial version of this daydream involves me lifting one leg slowly, and change clinks out onto the ground, which I pick up and give to her, and then snort her 20 dollar bill up my nostril.  Honestly, people.  Have some sense.  The general public (whom Meg and I refer to as simply "The GP") are retarded.  Our founding fathers had more confidence in the average American than I do.  I wouldn't trust most of the GP to pick my nose (even if it is full of twenties), much less elected officials.  You should have to be able to pass a test in order to vote, have children, or appear on television.  Extremist views?  Perhaps, but the GP has worn me down.  I'm shell-shocked by stupidity.

      Special  urlLink Zales  edition!  "I strongly support marriage, however I do not support everyone getting married except for me. My greatest fear is that I will be the one at all the weddings, wearing black, chain-smoking, and saying things like-Damn you, Zales! People will avoid talking to me because they know if they do they'll have to sit and look through my "baby album," which is really just hundreds of pictures of my dog wearing Coach collars and Ralph Lauren cashmere sweaters." --my roommate  urlLink Megan , blogging her fears on marriage.

      (...without really trying.)  If you're reading this, you probably know me in some capacity.  You probably know that I go to an above-average amount of live concerts.  That statistic becomes more impressive when you see my current yearly income.  (I'll say this...making five figures sounds nice, and six sounds like Xanadu.)  I have decided that my spiritual gift might very well be talking myself into places I haven't the resources or access to be otherwise attending.  I thought this might be a timely topic, in that I am broke, yet went to a sold-out  urlLink Jars of Clay  show on Monday night, and plan on seeing  urlLink John Mayer  at the  urlLink China Club  tomorrow night, despite the fact that I have no money, and we don't have tickets to this unpublicized, semi-private soiree.  Will it pan out?  I have no idea, but as several people have remarked at one time or another, "If anyone can get in there, you and your friends can."  Here now are some helpful tips on scamming your way into ticketed events for less than your friends that actually condescend enough to deal with Ticketmaster. Never, NEVER miss a show you want to go to again...it's just not right.  Life's too short.  Firstly, I won't lie.  It helps to be female.  I'm not saying that "Girls Gone Wild" behavior need be employed (although I'm sure that helps too in many cases).   It's just that most ticket scaplers, security personnel, roadies, and band members are male.  Men in the live concert realm, as well as the sporting event realm, tend to be straight.  So if you're trying to get a ticket to "The Producers" on Broadway, maybe it's a different story.  Next, it helps to be brave.  If you are/look intimidated or unsure of yourself, you can FORGEEET IIIIIT!!!  The more "i could care less if I get into this thing" attitude you can give the guy, the better.  When I say "the guy," I mean either the ticket scalper, or the event personnel with whom you are speaking.  There are two basic ways Megan and I scam our way into life.  A) The scalper way.  We have done this several times, and it nearly always works.  The only time this is not advisable is for a show that you must see in order for your life to have meaning.  If it's that important to you, secure your seats in advance, so you're not out front stressing.  A scalper WILL approach you as you walk toward the venue...VERY casually ask his price for however many tickets you need.  Act as non-chalant as humanly possible.  (e.g., do NOT scream "I MUST SEE  urlLink JUSTIN  AT ANY PRICE!!! AGGHHHHHHH!!!!")  Whatever number he says, make a face.  It's important to not over-act in this segment.  Just wince a little and maybe mutter "come OOOON" drolly.  I usually make up a story about how I already bought a ticket for full price, but can't find my friends who are holding my ticket, so I'm NOT paying full price again.  At this point, the guy will begin his "hustle."  He will talk very fast and try to tell you how these tickets are worth so much more than whatever inane price he's offering.  At this point, firmly and smugly remind him that in a few minutes, the tickets he's holding will be worth exactly ZERO dollars, so he'd do well to sell them for anything at this point.  This is a great time to pull out an amount of cash from your pocket and appear to count it.  (You MUST MUST MUST have pre-determined how much you want to pay for a ticket, and ONLY pull out that much. Keep the rest safe from view.  If you say you only will pay 20, and the guy sees you reach into a wallet holding more, you'll NEVER get them for 20.)  Pull the desired amount out and ask for five dollars less than whatever you have in view...say you need the rest to get home.  Most people screw up at this step and stand around in a group flashing 20's left and right at each other as they try to figure out what to spend.  DO NOT GO TO CONCERTS WITH THESE PEOPLE! In fact, do not go anywhere with these people in NYC, as they sound like top candidates for a good mugging.  I would mug these people given the opportunity. Long story short, I used this method and got into John Mayer at Madison Square Garden for 12 bucks.  It was a 40 dollar ticket.  I sat in about the seventh row from the floor, and saw the entire show.  I saw a forty dollar NERD show for ten dollars in Central Park because it was raining an hour before the show were pricing tickets to move.  It stopped raining, I talked to Pharrell, ten bucks.  We saw Jars of Clay (sold-out) Monday night for face value, and had the best view in the place.  We could have talked him down, but our friend started flashing twenties and I knew we were screwed.  B) The awesome method.  The awesome method is how we got into Justin Timberlake's club show, and what we're hoping to employ again tomorrow night for John Mayer's show.  It basically involves luck and charm.  I am the luckiest person on earth, and if there are other parallel earths, I'm probably luckier than those people too.  This probably has a direct connection with my fearless nature.  Basically, the awesome method involves being friendly.  Also, your good luck basically comes from someone else's misfortune in this situation.  There will always be someone who becomes ill, becomes bored/tired early on, or has some random emergency.  Your mission is to identify these people as they come out of the venue, and ask if they mind you using their ticket stub if they're not coming back.  If they do mind, offer them a SMALL amount of cash.  We paid a girl 5 bucks for her Justin Timberlake ticket she paid 50 for (they were being scalped for 200).  Most people will be cool if you approach them in the right way and just give you the ticket.  And in you go.  Try not to jump up and down until you get inside. With the John Mayer show, we are going to try a new twist on the method, which is to find John's road manager Scotty Crowe and sweet talk him into getting us a couple of tickets.  The hope is that he will be so impressed that we know who he is (he writes John's HILARIOUS road journal) that he'll take us inside with him.  Will it work?  Tune in tomorrow.  I'll leave you with some pictures I have snapped, a sort of trophy of cheapskatedom.  How do you get cameras into venues that search bags?  I slip them into a container of maxipads or tampons.  Like I said, security people are straight guys, and most straight guys would rather let a dirty bomb into the place than touch a box of tampons.  It's like guy kryptonite.  They usually look in the bag, turn a sort of ashen color, and hand the bag back as if it contained venemous spiders.  It NEVER fails.  (Note: guys might not have as much success with this method, since they don't use either purses or feminine hygiene products.  So they should just put the camera down their pants and hope it doesn't start making noise and flashing while they're going through security (haaa...That's a funny mental image).  Good luck, and Godspeed.   Jason Mraz, Roseland Ballroom      Justin Timberlake, club show, Irving Plaza

      Blog fever has hit like the California Gold rush of 1849.  I know first-hand how seeing someone else's blog compels you think of nothing else until you have one of your very own.  Chris Walk and Kaelyn are now among the few, the proud, the..whatever we are.  Both addresses are listed below in my first post with the rest of the links.  Maybe someday I'll get around to putting them on my sidebar.  Maybe.   Walk's concluding paragraph is true...the girl that makes her bracket picks for mostly ludicrous/cosmetic reasons (e.g.: team name, colors, mascot, who's got a cuter shooting guard) will usually do better than average in a NCAA Basketball pool.  I know this because I am that girl.  I always pick Gonzaga to go to the final four because they're the underdog and I feel bad for them. I never pick Duke because it's boring to watch the same team win all the time (I think they're the NCAA b-ball version of the Yankees). I never pick Kent because they can't read, and you should have to read to win "The Big Dance"...sometimes I just close my eyes and let the "bracket pen of truth" fall where it will.  And as Chris mentioned, for some strange reason, that seems to yield a higher win percentage than the guys.  Guys will literally lose sleep over wondering if the injury to Murray State's power forward will really be significant, because God knows Southwest Missouri State (Branson campus) has been on a seven game winning streak, and win 74.53% of the time, but only 65.7534% of the time on the road, and only 54.5433% of the time when the episode of the Simpsons that was on that week was a re-run. So they lay there in their beds, staring into the darkness praying more earnestly than most of us have ever prayed for anything, BEGGING God for a new episode of the Simpsons this week. This is all just so SWSU can get their W, and the guy can win that 34 dollar pool at work, which he will blow on BW's wings and a pay-per-view Wrestlemania MMCXII.  (sigh)...it truly is March Madness.    For the record, I tried to create a link to my bracket, but apparantly there are passwords involved and it's just too complicated.  Who's running the tourney this year, the Homeland Security Commission?  As Jessi Dobos would say whilst rolling her eyes, "Geez."  I have St. Joe winning it all over U. Conn, 68-61.  Other elite 8 picks include: Kentucky, Gonzaga (good luck, little Jesuits.  I'm rooting for you,) Okla St., Duke (grr...), Miss St., and Stanford.  I am SO SPORTY SPICE!!!

      Do you ever feel like life is an episode of  urlLink the Apprentice , and you're getting called into the boardroom?  I'll bet God has better hair than "The Donald."  THINGS I WOULD DO WITH FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS: *Tithe five hundred dollars.  *Use the first 2,000 to pay off all past due bills, and next month's rent (student loans excluded) *Use the next five hundred to buy a new wardrobe, since I have lost a size and a half since moving to New York and none of my pants stay up without cinching a belt as tight as it will go.  I look like I'm a character from the last scene of BIG.  I haven't bought new clothes in soooo long. *Use five hundred to buy a nice keyboard, trade my old guitar in for a new one, and buy some equipment I can use to further my career in a tangible way. *Use two hundred to buy concert tickets to all the shows coming up that I want to see.  While we were waiting for the  urlLink Jars of Clay  show tonight, the venue was advertising upcoming events on a screen...NERD, BRMC, The Thrills,  urlLink Sondre Lerche , Phantom Planet, Death Cab for Cutie,  urlLink John Mayer ...all playing within the next month in the city. NOT FAIR!!!   * Use five hundred to buy a crappy car, three hundred buying three round trip airline tickets on  urlLink AirTran  so I can fly into Akron once every so often to see Matt (the BF) for a few days.  (The car is to get from my sister's in Akron to Matt's house in Columbus and back, or for emergencies when I might need a car..I feel helpless without one. *Use the last five hundred to buy Matt a crappy car so he can get rid of his Jeep (he pays out nearly his whole income on its monthly payments, and wants desperately to trade it in for a reliable clunker he can drive for a few months.  Without car payments, he could come up a lot more, and be a lot less stressed also.)   THIS is the life I dream of.  A measly five thousand dollars, and my quality of life would skyrocket to almost delirious potential.  Isn't that ridiculous? I mean, there are sure things I would do with bigger amounts of money, like retire my parents and send them on exotic vacations, buy or lease  urlLink The Pretty Weapons  a nice tourbus, buy a nice RV for long vacations/roadtrips, and probably visit the UK again, or maybe somewhere new.  But five thousand dollars is all that stands between me and a life that doesn't involve daily time and effort wasted on something as simple as how to see my boyfriend this MONTH or how to pay rent on time.  I know that God has obstacles in my life to build faith, but I believe that He is urging me to trust Him to accomplish the impossible.  I am going to pray for this money to all but fall from the sky.  I'll keep you posted.  Will it be a new job, will I win a contest?  Will a shoebox full of 20's show up on my doorstep?  Who knows, but I'm excited to see how  urlLink God  will pull it off.  Shout me out to the big guy if you have some time on your hands.  Thanks thaanks thaaanks.  Question of the day: What would YOU do with five thousand dollars?  IM me at NYCBrookelyn or email at BrookeAWilliams@hotmail.com with your thoughts, as well as any helpful advice as to where they might be handing out wads of cash to passers-by.  PS: I'm nervous, y'alls.  Lesley, Jessi, Rob, D-Lo,  urlLink Megan ,  urlLink Ben , KMiles, Walk, Garrett (sort of) and  urlLink Sarah  have all mentioned that they read this exercise in stream-of-consciousness.  I will try not to crack under the intense scrutiny of the blog audience.

      This has shown up in several blogs nationwide this week.   (Read: Ohio and Seattle) Apparently I hit my philosophical peak at age 15.  At least I have achieved one of my life goals...leaving a famous quote behind as a legacy.  "I love it when people say they believe in something, just not God.  What is it then, a giant Cheetoh?"  --Brooke Williams, circa 10th grade  Please, do all you can to perpetuate its fame.  I don't want to just be known as an ice cream scooper.

      So...blogging, huh?   Is that the soup du'jour?  Mmm....that sounds good.  I'll have that.  I fought tooth and nail against keeping a blog, convinced it was only a passing fad.  I'm still not convinced it's a "here-to-stay" medium, but four of my most literate, urbane, and generally hysterical colleagues (read: BFF's) now possess them, and I got jealous.  In the words of Jessi Dobos, "Why don't you have one of these?  You're funnier than I am."  She's wrong, I'm not funnier than she is, but here I am nonetheless.  I suppose in the end, I became a little afraid of being the schmoe that refuses some new technological medium and becomes the laughingstock of history.  (E.G.: "The Internet....that sounds stupid.  I'll wait 'til that blows over, thank you very much." --some retard in 1986)  Here are my favorite blogs...if yours isn't on here, send it to me and I'll see if you're as witty and interesting as these folks.  If not, maybe I can make a "special" section just for you at the bottom.  Speaking of special, here's something special.  My "links" function seems to be smarter than me.     LOOOOOONG TANGENT: VERY RANDOM BUT QUITE FUNNY...SWIM AT YOUR OWN RISK  I know what you're thinking, and no--I'm not talking about LINKS-- the Ohio Library Research binders that we all plagarized for health class reports.  There was another thing too, you could look up periodical articles on a myriad of topics...say you needed to know some facts and figures about the effects of smoking for your informative presentation called "The Marlboro Man: Maverick or Bandit?" (Cause God KNOWS those three required references don't just magically appear on a Bibilography) It would list relevant periodical articles, and where in the library you could find them.   Actually, it would tell you that there were many helpful articles, but that they were all an hour away in Chillicothe's library, and they had all been checked out anyway, because there was probably a 9th grader down there doing a similar report called "Newport Lights: How My Sister Got Grounded."  More than likely you didn't care, because if you were like me, you were procrastinating that research, using the program's cutting edge technology to look up must-know info with searches on "Jonathan Brandis" or "Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch" or "very special episode of Blossom" (cause you had missed it and you were PISSED!) I liked that program, it was was more helpful than the bulky LINKS triple-ring binders.  I wish I had it now..I guess we do, and its called Google.com, but it doesn't seem as novel somehow.  If anyone remembers what the program was called, I'll send you ten cents and call you up with my legendary impression of my high school librarian Mrs. Neely. (She oft dissuaded us from having fun with that mysterious periodical reference tool, whatever it was called, with a shrill "OK KIDS, GET QUIET!")  So yeah, no links.  As Lesley Brandenburg recently said about her GAP bill, "That's disheartening."  Until I figure it out, you're just going to have to cut and paste like they did in olden times.  You're really going to have to want to get to these pages, because my friends, your work is cut out for you.  UPDATE!!!! (Tuesday) I figured out the mystery that is hyperlinks.  I have doctored the remainder of this entry to incorporate them.  SO that whole part about no links..forget I said that.       urlLink Jessi Dobos's Blog  (Former roommate, current friend, future employee of Bono)    urlLink Megan Jerse's Blog  (Former Ohio resident, current roommate, and the future Mrs. John Mayer)   urlLink Lesley Brandenburg's Blog  (Former seasonal resident of Azerbaijan, current resident of the 'Ville --Westerville, Ohio that is, future show choir director)    urlLink Ben Scragg's Blog  (Former nuisance during junior high slumber parties, current brother-once-removed (in that he's not REALLY my brother, but should be), future President of something important)    urlLink Sarah Filipiak's Blog  (Former Scragg, current boss, future matron of honor...if i ever get that far)     urlLink Chris Walk's Blog  (Former resident of the legendary 703 Davis, current staff member of Campus Crusade, future resident of dirty, filthy France.)    urlLink Kaelyn Langer's Blog     (Former co-worker of mine at Planet Hollywood, current disgruntled hostess, future Manhattan socialite, seen at ALL the best parties.)    urlLink Staci Bishop's Blog  (Former fellow member of All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir and Cardinal Chorale, current disgruntled Villanova employee, future "happily ever after" ending for her and her BF Mike.     That's it for now.  I don't want to come on too strong and scare you off.  I like you too much to ruin what we have.

      ...gives me credit for.   MORE RANDOMNESS.  I'm not taking any more DayQuil, I think it's fueling these dazed and confused musings.    I have decided I'm dying.  I'm not sure yet what I'm dying of, but if I don't blog for awhile, there's a good chance it means I finally kicked off.  I seriously think my body used up my immune system during my childhood illness, and has now taken a turn for the decrepit.  Scratchy throat and stuffy nose be damned, Meg and I are going to get up at the crack of dawn tomorrow and haul our overworked butts to Rockefeller Center to see John Mayer.  Then I'm going to go to work, and probably by then my body will have decided to shut one of my kidneys down or something just to spite me.  Stupid body.    "Big ups" (and 130 bonus points, to be used at their discretion) go to Steve Martin and Chris Walk, both of whom succeeded in constructing a sentence from the assigned words.  To both of you I say this: I am impressed in equal measure with your grammatical pinache, and your seeming abundance of free time. Kudos.  Did anyone else see Dane Cook's performance on the Comedy Central Birthday bash?  SO funny.  He might be the funniest person alive.  But then again, it might be Nate Johnson.   It just hit me... the day I next see Matt (May 21st) will be our SIX month anniversary. AND it will coincidentally be one year from the day we met.  AND it will be a Friday, with a 30 percent chance of showers. Anycrap...6 months!  This may not seem like a big deal to anyone else, but I feel it's quite a feat, all distance considered.  He's such a blessing...wow.  He teaches me so much about being open-minded and Christ-like and many other hyphenated words. Hip hip hooray (or even Hip Hop Hooray) for lobsters.  So, as many of you know, I got a much-awaited internship at  urlLink Spiewak , a clothing line.  They carry it at all Urban Outfitters, as well as Barney's, and a lot of trendy, fashion-forward boutiques.  I will be doing PR, marketing, and some event planning.  More as this story develops.  Thanks for all the encouragement and prayers, you're all simply lovely people.  The best part: in my interview, my now-bosses/co-workers were wearing jeans and t-shirts.  Hellooooo blazers, vintage t-shirts, and skirts over jeans.  I've missed you.  Goodbye, apron.  I'll see you in hell.  (I actually will still be at  urlLink ColdStone  three days a week, where I just got a promotion to "trainer."  Three days a week is not so bad, especially for fifty more cents an hour and a little authority...it's a tiny step up the ladder, and for now, I'm happy just to be on the ladder at all.  I told Chris Walk that up until now I've just been standing on the ground HOLDING the ladder! Har har.)  You know what's a GREAT word?  Mustachioed.  Use it in a sentence in the next 25 hours. (85 bonus points for using it in conversation of any kind with Ben Scragg --his im name is BenjamScragg, so no one's at a disadvantage for not knowing him-- 50 bonus points if the sentence is about Hall and Oates.)  Come on, stretch yourself.  You can do it.    I love the Vegas, and it's time to see if the Vegas loves me. (The OC fans?  Anyone? No?  Just us?)    Lastly, if you have a blog, and you haven't written in it for more than three days...watch your back.  You're going to get cut.  ( urlLink Sarah  and  urlLink Jessi  are perfect bloggers...always timely, always something new, always funny or thought-provoking (or scary, in the case of Jessi's GIANT SNAIL link!)  Watch out for  those giant snails everybody, and watch out for me, Surface.  I'm comin' atcha.  I'm gonna eff you up like a car wreck. Jesus is the answer.

      ...of a fragmented mind.  I am getting sleepy, but not quite sleepy enough to sleep, so thought I'd jot down some random stream-of-consciousness thoughts.  --Waiting for  urlLink Randy Surface  to blog is like waiting for Jesus to come back. You're pretty sure it will eventually happen, it just may not be in our lifetime.  Sigh..I think I'm just antsy because his blog has been pure nuggets thusfar, 1848 style.  Gold, Jerry, Gold!  --I've been playing guitar more lately, and seeing marked improvement.  I'm still not where I want to be though, and am unsure of if I will be able to "play out" in late May.  Maybe if I really work hard between now and then.  I'm not sure how people make it seem so effortless.  I've been playing pretty regularly for the better part of a year (and sporadically for a few years before that) and I still don't feel ready to "Take it to the streets."  But there is progress, which keeps me from giving up entirely.  Well, that and my delusions of grandeur.  Also, I seem to often encounter the query, "Do you play guitar?"  I'm not sure how to answer that.  They are looking for a simple "yes" or "no", not a ten minute background on how I am trying to learn and what skills I have and have not attained at this point in the process.  So..my question to my loyal blog readers is this: when is it okay to say that yes, you do play guitar?  When you can play a few chords?  When you can play ALL the chords?  When you have played a show?  I always feel like I'm fibbing, no matter how I answer. Maybe when and if some of you hear me play you can further discern the answer to this ponderance.  --Tonight on the phone, Matt said he had heard the word "insurgents" an inordinate number of times this week, due to world events.  He couldn't get it out of his head...he kept trying to use it in sentences where he fully well knew it didn't belong, just to hear himself say it.  I told him I heard Adam Goldberg say "nomenclature" in a preview for a new indie film, and I fell in love with it. (The word, not Adam Goldberg.)  So round and round we went, inserting ridiculous words into our already absurd conversation.  Neither of these words supercedes my passion for my favorite word, "catalyst."  A great word with a great meaning.  Your assignment is to use catalyst in a sentence today (80 bonus points for juxtaposing it near the use of "nomenclature" in the same sentence.  50 for "insurgents".)  --I bought an a$$-ton of elitist British music magazines like Mojo, Q, and Uncut this week.  I have realized to my horror that I really don't know that much about Pop Culture.  Many of you are surely laughing, because we've met at some point in our lives and you think you know differently.  Well, my thirst for Pop Culture knowledge is unquenched, and I've found myself hungrily devouring any scrap of information about 20th century music history I can get my hands on.  (Film and TV also, but mostly music this week.)  I will confess something semi-ridiculous to you.  I often stand in Virgin Megastore, and wonder if it is within the realm of possibility for someone to be familiar on SOME level with every artist they carry.  Ok, maybe not three-floor Virgin Megastore, but what about a little old record store in a mall somewhere, or Wal-Mart? (New Country excluded for taste purposes.)  I confess that a not-so-tiny megalomaniacal part of me wants to try it.  I'll admit it's probably just a result of never having been challenged in school, and wanting something bigger than myself to set my mind to, but maybe it's more.   Maybe God is somehow preparing me for the Entertainment industry by giving me this insatiable hunger and passion.  Because I don't just want to collect the facts...i genuinely want to hear the music and know the history.  I genuinely love all kinds of music, and how it all fits together and influences each other.  I still want to be a VJ, but now I think I'd rather be Matt Pinfield than La-La, if you catch my meaning.  --John Mayer is playing the Today show Friday morning.  If only we could go....oh, wait.  FREE J MONEY??  We're totally there, at three a.m. in Rockefeller Plaza, camping out for a good spot.  I'll bet work will be much more enjoyable Friday coming off the delirium of no sleep, too much coffee, and the adrenaline kick of hearing the oh-so-sweet verbage and counterpoint of Johnny Mayer from nearly point blank range.  Never mind that it's probably only two songs.  Sometimes you gotta take what you can get, and sometimes that means two songs at 7 am.  Stay tuned for asanine updates, as I'm sure we cannot just attend like normal people.  there will have to be some sort of "event."  --Still don't know about the internship, but I did find out that the main guy is in Cali this week, so I think he's just working on other things and I'm on the backburner.  In other words, no news is good news.  I'm going to fire off an email tomorrow just touching base and asking what my status is.  I have a peace about it...God's going to put me where he wants me, and I think He's cool with me being at  urlLink Spiewak .  We shall watch....and pray.  --You should see the new Jay-Z video "99 Problems."  The best thing to happen to hip-hop since...I don't know.  A long time ago.  What a great farewell video.  (I personally think he'll be back in a few years, but that's just me.)  I saw the making of the Video and re-fell in love with Jay-Z.  And Rick Rubin.  If I could have lunch with any three people, living or dead, Rick Rubin would be on the short list.  I don't know if he'd be top three, but he'd be up there.  Jesus (for obvious reasons), C.S. Lewis (my favorite author/theologian), John Mayer (my favorite lyricist), P. Diddy (my favorite businessman), Michael Showalter, or any member of the State (my favorite sketch comedy ensemble), Justin Timberlake (if I have to tell you why we're not friends), Matt Eifler (first love, old friend, lost touch), Clare Ring (high school BFF and first accountability partner/small group co-leader, lost touch), Matt Pinfield (knows EVERYTHING about Music, used to be an MTV VJ), Fred Waring (music genius of the mid-20th century), Cole Porter (my favorite songwriter), Paul McCartney (my favorite Beatle), Tina Fey (SNL--duh), Lorne Michaels (SNL--double duh), Bill Bright, Ben Folds, any member of Jars of Clay (especially Dan or Matt), Conan O'Brien, Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Wes Anderson, Pharrell Williams, Christopher Guest, Billy Graham...I think the common thread here is that they all strike me as super-human in some way, of possessing something that 99.998 percent of people on earth either don't have or can't tap into.   I'm sure most other people would want to meet more politically aligned figures, and kudos to you for that.  But this is my blog and my short list, so Rick Rubin and the unlikely rabble it is.   Ok, back to reading about 1987.  Speaking in strictly Guns and Roses terms, it was a very good year.

      ...but often bored.  I'll readily admit that I love making lists.  It's a little like enjoying hearing oneself talk, but on paper.  I especially love lists that pertain to me.  Is that vain?  I imagine so--but what is a blog for if not to entertain a little self-indulgence from time to time?  So I'm going to list for you my favorite all-time movies  (read: not objective BEST, just the ones I glean sheer unbridled joy from for whatever reasons I may or may not explain.).   Inspired by Randy's list of his favorite animals (who knew bees were sexy? Dane Cook taught me they could be deadly, John Belushi taught me they could be funny, but it was  urlLink Mr. Surface  who introduced the concept of bees as sex symbols of the animal world.)  Just before Megan and her friend Allyson (who is town for the weekend) went to bed, we watched a little Good Will Hunting on Bravo (seriously, is it on a loop?) and I made an off-the-cuff comment that is now blossoming into a blog before your very eyes.  I said, "Wow, I love this movie.  I never get tired of it...it's one of my all-time top five favorites."  Of course, I had no top five list.  I tried to make a list of my all-time top ten favorite songs earlier this year, and forced myself to stop when I realized that the list was approaching 200 songs with no signs of slowing.  So yeah, partially in tribute to Randy, and partially in tribute to the list-making movie High Fidelity, here is my list. these are the ones that change my life anew on each repeat viewing. Eat it, Ebert.  (This could evolve into a regular list-making blog segment.  I'm sure you're all giddy with anticipation.  Breathe into a paper bag or something.)  BROOKE'S 25 FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME (in sort of correct order, subect to change at author's ever-changing discretion.)   The Royal Tenenbaums  -- my favorite movie of all time.  perfection on celluloid.    Good Will Hunting  -- Try to write a better original screenplay.  I dare you.    Waiting for Guffman  -- A mockumentary on two of my favorite topics: the theatre and small-town life.  Old School  -- Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson, Seann William Scott...I almost peed the first 2 times.  William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet  -- I'll never forget Sarah and I watching this for the 1st time, in awe.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring  -- visually breath-taking like none other.    Office Space  -- It just NEVER gets less funny.  NEVER.    Rushmore  -- Wes Anderson is a genius.  I want to make a big statue of him in my living room.  High Fidelity  -- What a great book adaptation.  Funny, sad, smart.  FILLED with top five lists.  Yum.  Notting Hill  -- My favorite romantic comedy ever.  A Hard Day's Night  -- I liked the Beatles 'til I saw them parodying themselves...then I LOVED them.  High School  -- A "social commentary" documentary made in '68 about a public school in Philly.   The Breakfast Club  -- 80's perfection.  No special effects, just five great performances.    This is...Spinal Tap!  -- "These go to eleven."  Steel Magnolias  -- I tell Megan not to let me watch this, because I just sit and cry for hours every time.  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  -- weird, wonderful, dark, highly stylized, what's not to love?  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  -- Maybe this should be higher on my list...so entertaining.  Last of the Mohicans  -- The only thing that gives LOTR a run for its $ in the "visually beautiful" dept.  The Godfather Parts 1 and 2  --these count as one.  Shut up.  The baptism/mass killing scene...perfection.  The Virgin Suicides  -- Speaking of Coppolas...delicious Suburbia, with all the tiny glories & tragedies.  Top Gun  -- we used to watch this weekly at Stimson.  Uber-quotable, stands up to multiple viewings.  When Harry Met Sally ... -- Smart...very smart.  A classic.  Tommy Boy  -- We watched it  every  weekend my entire H.S. senior year & laughed every time.  Night of the Living Dead  -- The best movie to commentate to MST3K style, but also genuinely creepy.  Oliver!  -- I think its the "Who Will Buy" song that gets me...it birthed my desire for the  urlLink Athens  Street Musical.  (I excluded other favorites for an assortment of reasons --mostly because I ran out of room-- like What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, Dead Poet's Society, Shadowlands, Braveheart, Model Behavior, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, Reality Bites, Meet the Parents, Newsies, Airborne, and Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail...is anyone still reading this?  If so, send me (or even better, blog)  your  all-time favorites.  Remind me of what I'm forgetting.)

      ...sniff, sniff.  Megan and I both took the day off of work because we were feeling under the weather.  To be more specific, we felt as though the weather were doing some sort of tribal rain-dance on our foreheads and stomachs.  No fun.  We're in much better spirits now after a day of rest and truancy from work.  I am not so sure what to blog about today...unusual.  I just feel like I  should , since I haven't in awhile.  I'm sure a lot of you were getting antsy.  I know I get antsy when I check someone's blog and they haven't written.    I think I'll call this one "Things Brooke is looking forward to."  There, that sounds nice and positive.  Firstly, I'm looking forward to getting a call from Spiewak tomorrow, hopefully informing me of an internship offer with their PR/Marketing department.  Secondly, I'm looking forward to the weather staying as nice as it has been.  I am a little afraid that it's all a cruel joke, and God will plunge us back into 4 more months of winter next week.  As Randy quipped last weekend, "Yeah, God  loves  to stick it to people."  I am looking forward to being outside, to seeing New York come alive again.  I have been to Central Park twice this week, and it seems a little bit like the magical land of Narnia there...blossoming trees, the zoo, and let's not forget the man with the iguanas on his head dressed like bikers.  (Even if we TRIED to forget him, could we?)  Next, I'm looking forward to seeing a Pretty Weapons show.  I'm not sure exactly when this is going to happen, but I haven't seen one in like 11 months, and I want to stab myself with those tiny little plastic swords they put in cheese cubes at receptions every time Matt says "Yeah, we have a show tonight," as he did again tonight.  On that note, I am looking forward to my trip home.  The tentative dates are May 19th-31st.  The loose outline is: flying into Akron and spening a night gossiping with my sisters (a rare treat...points taken from your score if you were not aware that I had two sisters.)  Then going to C-bus to spend a few days with my lobster (read: boyfriend), Matt, then going home for a few days to chill with the rents, Teresa, and anyone that wants to chill at The Belpre.  My Birthday (number 25 in the series, for those of you keeping score) is that Thursday, and I want to go to Athens and just chill for the day.  I want to go to Donkey and take a nap on a couch, and then mosey out to Strouds Run with my windows down and just sit with my guitar in a canoe or on the dock of Dow Lake and enjoy the quiet.  If friends can make it, all the better.  Then I'll pop in on 180 and catch up with the Crusade folks, and go out to dinner with my BFF's somewhere fun.  Sigh...yeah, I am looking forward to that a LOT.  Friday I'll maybe chill with the OU peeps somemore (Tracy, are you reading this???) and head back to Columbus to spend the weekend with Matty until I have to head back on Monday.  Will it all go down this way?  Probably not.  I have to make a LOOOOOT of people happy, but hopefully when it's all said and done, I'll be one of them.  I'm looking forward (maybe waaay forward) to being able to see Matt all the time, not just one sixth of the time.  I see him like, an Air National Guard amount of time.  One weekend a month, and two weeks a year.  I'm looking forward to the day when I don't have to have a job with an apron, uniform, or nametag.  I'm looking forward to being out of debt, or at least being able to pay every bill on time.  I'm looking forward to the day when I can go shopping for things I need (in the upper-middle class sense of need, like a new pair of jeans or shoes that I'll wear often) without feeling guilty.  I'm looking forward to getting headshots, and taking some sketch comedy classes at Upright Citizen's Brigade.  I also hear that Kevin Allison of the State (read: the priest from the "Kill Tim" sketch that says "I am SHOCKED...to see members of my congregation..praying this BLASPHEMOUS prayer!  And yet, I can't help but concur! Lord, KILL THIS BOY!") offers sketch writing workshops, so I would like to do that if the money's right.  I'm hoping to be financially stable enough to do that by the end of this year.  I'm looking forward to heaven.  Screw earth.  Earth sucks. I would much prefer living in a mansion with Jesus (but Megan is a close second in roommate choices.) :)  I'm looking forward to getting email from Jessi Dobos.  And Sarah Filipiak.  Their email always makes me feel so loved, and they're both so entertaining.  BFF's are the best.  I'm looking forward to seeing some live shows soon (Sondre Lerche? John Mayer? Jason Mraz? We'll see.) and perhaps...performing some cover songs while I'm at home?  (We'll see.)  Mae and Sarah said they were in...I think I can get Bennie Scragg and Randy Surface to climb aboard.  Here's hoping.      I better go play guitar...home is only 27 days away!  ALL SKATE

      ...for Peanut-free schools.  Thanks to my avid blog audience, who did some swift research and determined that Peanut-free schools DO exist, and deal with the concern over allergy-related issues.  Basically, some kids died in Cleveland because they were allergic to Peanuts, and so the whole PTA army has freaked out over it.  I was allergic to the entire outdoors growing up, but no one kept the other kids from throwing leaves or picking flowers on the playground.  My life could have been in danger.  Also, this whole story has a great "Eric Nygren" quality to it.  Anyone remember him?  Great guy, violently allergic to nuts.  (Not peanuts, ironically, but all other kinds of nuts.)  Randy Surface spent the better portion of our freshman year at O.U. plotting to kill Eric (his good friend) by poisoning him with nuts.  Death by nut.  He was mostly romancing the idea of how ridiculous it would be to MURDER someone by rubbing some sort of nut on them, or making them ingest it unknowingly.  We even wrote a musical about it...or at least part of one.  I think we got bored and went to Wendy's after writing the first act or two.  It was a lot like "Rent," except that Eric Nygren died of a homicidal nut overdose instead of a suicidal drug overdose.  But other than that, everything was pretty much the same.  Speaking of nuts, my boyfriend called me tonight singing.  No hello, or any sort of reasonable salutation.  Instead, he began singing a song he composed with Brandon...in a Darkness-worthy falsetto, he belted out "Psychedelic Ninja Spree," over and over again.  They have another new song about psychedelic beards that is equally ridiculous...but not as ridiculous as Peanut-free schools.

      ...or at least for the nuts it may or may not contain.  So the Cold Stone saga continues.  Many delegates from the notorious GP (General Public) breezed through the Stone today, wearing crazy like it was cheap perfume.  My personal favorite of the day was the lady that came in a few weeks ago demanding to know if there are eggs in our ice cream (it turns out, there are not.)  She didn't get her answer fast enough, so began SCREAMING at me as if I was a disobedient child.  Needless to say, I remembered her today.  She was asking my co-worker if there were any peanut products in our ice cream.  Clearly, this lady has some specific food ingredient issues, but its a fair question.  My co-worker is explaining to her in her best "this is only my part-time job, do I look like I work for Corporate?" voice that no, she didn't think the ice creams contained nuts, but she wasn't sure.  She indicated to the woman that a trip to our website would resolve any questions.  The woman begins to raise her voice, irately shreiking, "Well, what about Pistachio??  What about Butter Pecan?!?!?!" At this point, I have to turn around, because I realize I have begun to laugh.  You seriously would have thought this lady was auditioning for "Days of our Lives."  The melodrama was astounding.  I was already committing the incident to memory, reminding myself to remember to blog this anecdote, when the topper hit.  In the midst of her tirade, she cries out (seemingly near a nervous breakdown right there in front of the waffle cone display) the following:   "But I have to know! My son goes to a Peanut-free school!"  WHAT???? WHAT???? WHAT????  (Insert L'il Jon voice at your discretion.)  Ok.  WHAT????  A PEANUT FREE SCHOOL???  What the hell is happening?  What has happened to the universe?  The world is in an uproar.  A peanut free school?  I cannot wrap my mind around this concept.  Has the Atkins diet permeated our society at its most basic cellular level, the elementary school?  What on EARTH is a peanut-free school?  Has anyone else ever heard of anything like this?  I cannot rest until I know more about Peanut-free schools, and if and why they exist.  If you know more, please don't hoard this information all for yourself.  Email me.

      ...or at least industry parties.  So my new BFF Victoria (whom I met at church) was nice enough to call and invite me to join her at an "industry party."  She has explained her job to me at least twice, and I still have not even the most elementary grasp of it.  From what I can gather, it has to do with the business end of the fashion industry.  I think.  She had to drop off a CD to a client, but wasn't sure what the "lameness factor" would be, so she wanted to insure a fun time by taking a friend, in this case, me.  The party was in the Meat Packing district, which is way downtown and west in Manhattan.  It's one of those places that you can tell is the next big thing, like Soho was, and then Williamsburg in Brooklyn was.  There are uber-chic restaurants, clubs, and...warehouses.  Entire streets of empty warehouses, which gives the whole neighborhood a rather empty, creepy feel.  We pull up in front of one such warehouse...the cabbie goes "we're here." and we look at one another.  Other than a bouncer and a tiny portion of velvet rope, there's no one on the entire street, and no indication that this is a club at all.  The front of the place is graffiti-laden and dilapidated.  It literally looks like somewhere meat is packed, and until a year ago, it probably was.  We walk in to find a very swanky club, and a surprisingly unpretentious crowd.  A fair share of beautiful people, but everyone seems to genuinely be enjoying themselves.  I pick up a magazine sitting on the bar, and am informed that the staff of the magazine are hosting this particular soiree.  I can tell from the cover that its all about...techno.  Illlllch.  My heart sinks...I guess there's no hope of the music improving.  Everyone else seems to be enjoying it, so I try to go with the flow.  Victoria was great to go out with, and definitely made me feel included in her conversations.  However, there was one point early on where she had to speak with her client, and she politely excused herself to do so.  Enter awkward situation.  I immediately thought three things: 1. Oh, no. Awkwardness. 2. I love to hear Jessi Dobos's anecdotes about awkward situations. 3. I am totally going to blog about this.  I survey the room and try to figure out what to do.  What is the best way to look cool without looking like I'm TRYING to do so?  Hmmm.  My first inclination would be to simply go to the bar..it's a time killer...I can wait for the bartender to take my order, get a water or club soda, and just wait it out there.  This was not an option because we'd just done that, so I had a full cranberrry juice in my hand.  Crap. I could sit down....but Victoria had said she's only be a minute, and I would have to cross the room and abandon her in order to do so.  So, it looked like I pretty much was left with "stand there and try to look non-chalant."  I looked around, and noticed at least three people looking at me as if to say "why is that girl just standing there by herself, not moving, looking about nervously?"  Double crap, non-chalance had failed.  I needed a prop.  So I reached into my purse, balancing my drink, and dug around for my cell phone.  I found it, and pretended to check the time or something for a few seconds.  Anywhere except a noisy club, I could have just made a non-important call, but the dull thud of techno was much too loud for any hope of that. Once, twice, three times a-crappy.  I began to feel that Junior High part of me rise up, to my horror.  I suddenly felt very unsure of myself, very "least cool girl at the party"   I then notice that the man standing beside me is buying, only mildly discreetly, some form of designer drug.  Gooooooooooooooooood.  I try to put a "I don't want to buy any drugs" face on...it seems to work.  I also gave the guy doing the drugs a little bit of a dirty look, hoping my obvious disgust would be enough to make him re-think the choices he's made in life and possibly enroll in re-hab.  The look did not seem to work.  Eventually, Victoria introduced me to her client, who ended up giving me his business card and telling me to call him regarding an internship/part-time job.  He's the Creative Director for  urlLink Spiewak .  Spiewak is a clothing company that also does music and some other related PR things. urlLink Urban Outfitters  carries a lot of their line.  He also seemed fairly confident that he could get  urlLink The Pretty Weapons  on their concert series bill (which is in conjunciton with  urlLink Revolver Magazine )  I did not mention that it happens to be my boyfriend's band, since I knew that would blow my street cred in getting them on the bill.    Speaking of my BF, he's on his way here as we speak.  I am so so so excited.  Like Jessi Spano. That is not a sufficient amount of "so's", but the right amount would be really annoying.  So.......that's all for now. (so.)

      I woke up late (ok i woke up at 4, except for the 10:00-10:30 slot where I was awakened three times by the doorbell.) I had 8 voicemails and a text message.  The text message was from Victoria, saying she had uber-fun last night when we went out...two messages were from creditors....one was from Jessi Dobos.  The remaining FIVE were from Matt.  They began normal enough, "Hey, hon, it's me...call me back when you wake up."  By the third message, it was "GET YOUR ASS OUT OF BED!!!  PLEEEEEAAASSSSE! I NEED YOU TO CALL ME!!...kloveyoubye."  I only got as far as the fourth message, because he said, "you need to call me because Matt might be coming to..my phone cuts out, and drops the call.  AGGGGHHHH!  I call immediately.  Long story short: MATTY WILL BE HERE AT 9:45AM TOMORROW.  (Imagine me erupting into a Howard Dean-worthy shriek).  I haven't seen Matt for over a month.  AND I might be able to get them a show here...AND I might have an internship opportunuity with an amazing clothing/music/PR place.  Maybe winter DOES have an end after all.  I DID notice the trees were budding for the first time yesterday.  Happy sigh.

      ...Worst movies ever.  Everyone seems to be posting their picks for the best movies ever.  It's tempting, but I think it would be more fun to list the WORST movies I've ever seen.  Here goes nothing...no, seriously.  (I have restrained myself to only movies I have been unfortunate enough to sit through...which means Crossroads, Gigli, and other similar turds can't make a bad list worse.)  Congo (Hands down the worst movie ever..you can see the zippers)  Solaris (no, George Clooney.  Put down the bad movie and step away slowly.  Sloowwwwwwly! There!)  Contact (I don't care if Jodie Foster's in it, it SUCKS.  SUCKS!)  Starship Troopers  The Godfather Part 3  Anaconda (no one's saying it's not funny...but come on..the snake SCREAMS, and also spits out Jon Voigt, who then winks at the snake.)  Cabin Fever (one of Ben Scragg's dollars to anyone who can tell me what the point of this movie is, and you're not allowed to say "there is none."  That would be too easy.)  That movie with John Travolta where he's the cigarette smoking angel...what was that...Michael?  City of Angels...if angels have receding hairlines and nasaly montone voices a la Nick Cage, count me out for heaven.  I'd be too pissed off all the time.  The Beach...i felt so betrayed by my then boyfriend Leo DiCaprio...I went home and tore down all of my Tiger Beat pin-ups.  (Yeah, I was in college, SO?)  The Graduate.  The American Film Institute touts this movie as the eighth best American made movie ever, but I think they made that list when there were only eight American movies.  I know, I know..it's an early example of existentialism...of a film dealing with the lack of event or emotion rather than event or emotion itself.  I get that ennui, detachment, numbness along the lines of "The Catcher in the Rye"...it's all the point.  It still made me want to stab my eyes out so I would feel something other than boredom.  Maybe that's how you're supposed to feel, but I don't care.  SOMETIMES CLASSICS SUCK.  Like Peter Frampton.    That's it for now, but I'm sure I'll think of lots more...I know I hate more than ten movies.  Send me your picks...brookeawilliams@hotmail.com, or IM me at NYCBrookelyn.

      "I've loved you since the moment I laid eyes on you, looking all gorgeous, standin' in line at Kelly's Roast Beef...teasin' me witch ya tight pants on.  You have opened up parts of me that I nevah even knew existed...exspecially the queer pahts." --Ben Affleck as Donnie Badelardi, at his gay wedding to Michael "Smitty" Smith on SNL (Ravi and I watched it again tonight.)  Brooke: Ew, that dog statue looks human. Ranee: It looks like Rick James. (overheard by anyone in a ten foot radius of us at the City Opera Thrift Store on 23rd and Lex, looking at a gloriously hideous white porcelain dog/gargolye/human headed statue that bore an UNCANNY resemblance to super-freaky Rick James...hair and all.  It was 45 dollars....tempting.  I'm going to dream about that dog tonight. MANY Rick James dog jokes ensued. I know you're thinking "How many can there possibly be?"  A LOT, my friends.)

       urlLink Sarah Filipiak's  newly imagined game show "Who's More Arrogant?" has prompted me to devise a pilot of my own for the fall season, called "Win Ben Scragg's Dollar." It goes like this:  The point is to win Ben Scragg's money.  It's a lot like Win Ben Stein's money, except  urlLink Ben Scragg  has not approved this idea.  I will provide various questions on a myriad of subjects, and post them somewhere...like my blog, or IM away message.  (If this stage is a success, then I will perhaps integrate physical challenges, much like the ones depicted on  urlLink Nickelodeon 's "Double Dare" and "Family Double Dare," hosted by everyone's favorite possibly late Canadian, Marc Summers. Like the one where you picked booger like substances out of a giant nose for cash and prizes...or in this case, a dollar.) The first one with the correct answer, wins a dollar.  Of Ben Scragg's money.  If Ben answers first, he gets to keep his money, and maybe some sort of retribution should happen so its not so one-sided, but I'm not convinced of that.  I disqualify myself from meing this game's benefactor on two grounds.  Firstly, I made it up.  Secondly, I have no money.  I can already hear Ben saying "but Brooke, I don't have any monetary denominations just now either."  To that I say, "well then you'd better study up."  By the way, it's up to the winner to extract Ben's dollar from his person.  The producers (that's me) are not liable for any reluctance (read: a punch in the face) on the part of Mr. Scragg, because as I mentioned, he is unaware of the game and will probably not become an enthusiast even after he becomes cognizant of its existence.    In the end, everyone will be entertained and we'll keep Ben on his toes.  Who's ready to play "Win Ben Scragg's Dollar?"  Advantage, Snipes.  Your move, Bobby Brown.

      I haven't bought any jeans in a really long time...it was well before moving to New York over ten months ago, I can tell you that much.  All of my current jeans sort of hang off of me lethargically.  This is because fat and New York don't get along.  You walk everywhere, you have no money, and you have no time for a lot of snacking.  Weight gets lost without much effort.  I spent college wearing 9/10's in pants.  (Keep in mind, I'm 5'9" and a half.)  By the time I moved to New York, I was wearing almost exclusively size 8's.  Then the pounds started coming off slow and steady, two by two, like the animals came off the ark. All of my clothes look ridiculous.    So I thought the madness was over, and I had settled into a few months of my new 6/8 lifestyle (ok, usually 6) and then today all hell broke loose in American Eagle.  I reallllllllly needed jeans, because mine were literally falling down, belt or no.  It was time.  So I pulled out the ol' AE card, and took my friend Ranee shopping.  I picked out a couple 6's I liked and headed to the fitting room.  On the way there, the girl goes "those aren't going to fit you.  Take these."  She hands me a pair labeled "4 long."  I laughed in her face and said "I came out of the womb at LEAST a 6."  She said, "I can tell you're a 4, just try them on." I wish you could have seen the look on my face when I zipped up the fours and buttoned them, and realized....they fit.  I bought them.  There are a pair of 4 longs in my closet right now.  The entire universe is in an uproar.  Or at least the one that revolves around me.    Now I realize that most women would probably value being a 4, and I must admit, there's sort of a novelty excitement about it, brought on by years of reading magazines that stress you must be the size as a small stem of celery to be desirable.  But I honestly have no desire to be any smaller...I remember being THRILLED with just being a single digit again the first time I fit into 8's.  I liked being an 8, and a 6.  Four just seems...creepy.  (Maybe I should have filed this entry under "News of the Creepy."  Being too thin is just as gross as being too fat.  (Lara Flynn Boyle, anyone?)  Great, I've been looking for something new to worry about.  So basically, I need to wait until its time to buy pants again before I can see if this was a fluke, or if I really am destined for fourdom for awhile.  Maybe Chris Cieto can wear my 8's.

      ...that is how I would describe my day.  Against all odds, I had a great day. Some days are predestined to be great...major holidays, NSync concert days, vacation...but this day was all but scheduled to be sub-par. First of all, I had to work, so a certain level of dread came pre-packaged.  Also, I had spent the last few days worrying about a situation with a colleague that is too complicated to go into here.  So I went to bed last night feeling stressed and just nauseated with anxiety.  (Not normal Brooke Williams qualities.)  Enter God being gracious. (Stage left.)  First, the aforementioned colleague called, and what I thought would be a very upsetting conversation was a relieving, pleasant affair.  A very good way to start the day.  I took a few deep breaths, thanked God, and realized this day might not be destined for personal atrocity.  I fell back asleep for awhile...glorious...and wake up when my co-worker and new friend Tristan shows up to eat lunch and give me a haircut.  I was uncharacteristically brave as she cut more obvious layers into the front half of my hair.  (Think Gina Gershon or Mandy Moore) ...not BANGS, or a MULLET, just a very casual but fashionable style.  I normally spend the first 24 hours of any haircut in tears, even if the stylist has done exactly what I asked.  I resist change like England resists the Euro.  Then I realize I like it, or at least come to accept it.  Not this time..I looked in the mirror tentatively...and LOVED what I saw! I looked so much better!  And it was free...I just saved 35 bucks (which I am adding to my faith goal of 1000 total, since I would normally have to pay for a haircut, thus bringing my total to 585!)  Tristan and I then proceeded to make some surprisingly yummy pasta for lunch, and we had great times. The Darkness was played back to back with Sarah McLachlan for maybe the first time ever in the universe.  Things were looking decidedly up. Tris took off around 1:30pm, and I spent the next two hours doing NOTHING.  It was delicious.  I watched some VH1, some Days of our Lives, checked email,  read some magazines, downloaded and listened to some GREAT -though illegal everywhere except Canada- music, and danced around in my underwear and sang loudly since I was the only one home.  Very "Risky Business"-esque.  I finally got around to productivity around 3:30 and got ready to run errands.  I touched up the new hairstyle, actually put make-up on (gasp!) and perfected what i've been attempting eye-make-up-wise for the first time ever, to my great satisfaction.  (Is anyone still reading this?) I put on a sassy outfit and out I went to the bank.  I stopped to get the mail, and got 20 bucks and a card from my mom "just because."  Awww... There was also Megan's EW, with "The Great American Pop Culture Quiz--The 90's" staring up at me.  Ooh, this might be a really good day.    At the bank, the check I was worried might have beaten me to the deposit slip had not been deducted, meaning I was in the clear finance-wise.  Whew.  I called dad and we spoke for awhile, and he informed me they were sending me a huge Easter basket full of goodies.  Also, I should just let him know when I wanted to come home for my birthday, and he'll pay for the flight.  This is the best day EVER.  (Ooh, I should add that to my faith goal total...cause flights home to see everyone were on the list...let's see, that's 20 from mom, and another 160 for the round trip flight...that's 180, added to my 585...carry the one....equals...765.  Wow, so I'm over three-fourths of the way there already!!!  AMAZING.)  Okay, so I call the Real Estate lady, who has actually gotten around to calling me after seven weeks of non-activity, and she has an open house for me to show tomorrow.  That's 20 dollars, great!  I stop at Starbucks for a rare indulgence...mmm, Apple Fritter and Cafe Mocha. It was yum.  I then travel the entire five blocks from my front door to Victoria Secret, (stopping briefly into Cold Stone...one of my young male co-workers told me I look especially pretty today...i KNEW the haircut was a success!) where the saleslady practically trips over her measuring tape to grab me and tell me how amazing my outfit is (dress over jeans and a cardigan, with pointy black Stiletto heels...not that exciting)  and escorts me over to a sales associate, and basically treats me like a celebrity.  This girl acted like my personal shopper.  I have never had such a pleasant experience shopping before! I told her of my previous undie woes, in that all but about three of my current pairs are too big, especially in the butt region.  She showed me great styles and helped me find sizes...I bought four pairs of undies and a tank top, all of which I am thrilled with, and all of which fit my butt.    On the way home, I call Matt and we talk for like 7 minutes (I woke him up from a nap)...sometimes those conversations are the best.  The Pretty Weapons had a show tonight in Columbus, so I just called to hear his voice for a few minutes in the day, since our normal phone time slot would be filled with Rock.  He was sleepy and schmoopy and just cute.  He asked where I was and I told him I just bought some undies at Victoria Secret.  His response: "mmmmmmmm.....underwear."  Guys are pervs. :)  I came home and took the EW Pop Culture quiz (I got a 96, but a lot of it was bonus and extra credit earnings..i missed a lot) Then work...ACTUALLY not terrible!  I couldn't believe it.  My co-workers were in rare form, and the time passed quickly.  Supposedly Matt Dillon was in a few nights ago, but there was no sign of he or anyone else famous tonight.  I came home, gave myself a nice pedicure, and am now enjoying the blog world. Also, a friend text messaged me about possible thrift shopping Sunday...Hall and Oates t-shirts, here I come.  Chris Walk just told me that someone somewhere ate a chicken tender in my honor tonight.  The night could not end on a higher note.  I go to bed a happy camper.

If you're calm in the midst of a storm going on all around you, then having a peace is very meaningful and supernatural, because there's no natural explanation for feeling that way based on your circumstance.  But everyone has a peace when they're laying in a green meadow by a brook, with deer hopping by." --Teresa, using symbolism to get a fantastic spiritual maturity point across regarding a feeling of peace about something as a catalyst for an important decision.

      ...The Bloggies  No, the Bloggies are not the latest British rock invasion.  They are my made-up awards for best blog content.  I spend at least a little bit of every day reading blogs, keeping up with my friends' embarrassing situations and various hysterical rants.  It's a highlight to my day...in fact, when someone hasn't blogged in a while, I get sad and curl up in the fetal position.  If you haven't been as avid a blog reader as I, here's what you've been missing.  (I'd be interested to hear from others on their favorite blog entries...500 words, 3 references, ONLY ONE INTERNET REFERENCE, PEOPLE, 12 pt. Times New Roman font, double spaced.)  This should finally put to rest any malingering doubts that my friends are the funniest people in the Milky Way.     SARAH FILIPIAK  "Sarah's Journal"  New game show: "Who's More Arrogant?"  This show is sort of like "Win Ben Stein's Money" with me as the host (except nobody wins any money). You will attempt to prove that you are more arrogant than I am. Por ejemplo You: I memorized Tennyson's "Enoch Arden" my sophomore year of college. Me: I memorized the entire screenplay of "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," as well as a scene from "SeaQuest DSV," when I was 15.  ***SPECIAL INSERTED NOTE FROM BROOKE: I DID THIS TOO.  I RULE.*** -or- You: I've won four Pulitzers and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize last year. Me: I am better than you. Send entries to Sarah and be publicly refuted. Note: Anyone who attempts to prove his or her arrogance by ignoring this post automatically loses, because I am so arrogant I won't notice you didn't send an entry.  ..............................................................................................................  A friend e-mailed yesterday and told me she had The Worst Day, which was coincidental, because I had The Worst Day over the weekend. The Worst Day is apparently making rounds, so please take precautions to avoid getting it. The good news is, once you've had it, you can't get it again -- although there is a variant strain, The Worst Day Ever, which is particularly nasty.  ***NOTE FROM BROOKE: HER WEEKLY STRIP "CRITTERS" IS ALSO GLORIOUS, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO GO  urlLink HERE  TO SEE IT***  *************************************************************   BEN SCRAGG  "Proof You Don't Have Better Things To Do"  Alas, Spring Quarter is lurking in the shadows of tomorrow. Fear not, for I will smite Spring Quarter and feast upon its entrails with morose delight.   ...........................................................................................................  Finals are done, which means that life is good.  From here on out, I'm sticking it to the man every single day.  ............................................................................................................  Rick James: What did the five fingers say to the face? Charlie Murphy: I don't know. Rick James: SLAP!  At least once a day, I plan to do  urlLink this  instead of something else. Some people take vitamins, some people feed their goldfish; I don't think I do anything consistently on a daily basis, or at least not just once. Usually, I eat at least 6 or 7 times....let's see: no breakfast, but I did have 1.) a frozen pizza, 2.) gold star chili 3.) a marathon bar 4.) twizzlers 5.) a stupid dairy queen brownie sundae which resisted cosumption and would not yield to my plastic spoon. Okay, so that's five times today. I will do better tomorrow.  *I just slobbered on myself.*  .............................................................................................................  And what's up with girls who have hair all in their face and it's always covering up one eye? Can they even see? It's really distracting to watch you toss your head back 67 times in a five minute presentation. You're pretty, I get it, but don't overkill a good thing. Yes, I use lots of filler words and am self-depricating, but I am in no danger of whiplash. One word: headband.  *************************************************************   MEGAN JERSE  "Living in New York Really IS That Sweet"  So I'm like-I'll go do laundry now. But when I look in my little change jar, I see only Abraham's looking up at me, and those babies ain't no help. Do you notice that guys just have change laying around their room? Not in cute little jars or even bowls, but LAYING around the room, in piles, or sometimes pyramids or other random shapes. What are you doing with it? Do you realize how much money is probably in your room? How can you live knowing you might have up to ten dollars at your fingertips, but you just ignore it? I think it does really drive guys crazy, because by the time they are old men, they're doing things like pulling change from behind your ears. Now, that's just nutty. Loose change is something women do not put up with. Just ask Brooke. It annoys her to the point of making odd noises when you mention it.  ..Back to my laundry- All day long this dread is filling up inside of me-I don't have quarters....I DON'T HAVE QUARTERS!!! I somehow manage to sit through our service, but at Starbucks I break down and confess that if I don't get quarters soon, my life will cease to have meaning. Brooke and Victoria (our new super-cool NYC pal) suggest asking the barista for quarters. I, of course, am too chicken, so Victoria grabs my ten from my hand and saunters on up to the counter. Within seconds, she is holding a roll of quarters. Life again has meaning. I have my precious quarters.   ....................................................................................................   urlLink Now, there are days  when my dating situation reduces me to tears. These are normally the days when a) one more person I know announces they are engaged; 2) I see a picture of John Mayer and a supermodel (but Heidi is prego, but not by John. Haha); or 3) when some skeezy guy asks me out and I cannot pull out my boyfriend emergency whistle and tweet away, sending the skeez running as my boyfriend hurls towards him swinging a baseball bat. (What? So my boyfriend might have some jealousy issues. Like your imaginary boyfriend is perfect.)  .............................................................................................................  Don't get mad at me when you can't work the credit/debit machine. Ok, this one is my favorite, because it just proves how stupid Americans are. We have tons of tourists in our store-obviously-and many are foreign. They might not even speak English, but when I point them in the direction of our credit card swiper, they look at the machine, which CLEARLY shows a picture of how to insert your card, they swipe their card, and they're out of there. My fellow Americans, however, feel the need to FLIP OUT the second they even get near the machine. First they're swipping the card before I even have them rung up. (Ma'am, I haven't even folded your sweater yet. Please refrain from the excessive swiping.) Then they have no idea which way to put the card in. (Yes, ignore the picture. I'm sure your way is what they truly meant.) Then, there is...BUM BUM...a CHOICE. You can use your card as debit or credit. If they for some reason don't want to use debit, they start screaming-and I am not kidding-THIS CARD DOESN'T HAVE A PIN! IT'S A CREDIT CARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To which I respond, "That's fine. Just hit cancel. And please stop spitting on me. Thanks." At this point, it been 15 minutes, and the machine has timed out, and we have to start the whole process again.  Do not buy $800 of merchandise when your credit limit is $5.72. Honestly, what do you think is going to happen? That the bank is going to agree that you REALLY DO need those chinos and ignore the fact you have no money???   ..............................................................................................................   LESLEY BRANDENBURG  "Isn't It Great To Be Miss Brandenburg?"  I was randomly reading Ben Scragg's blogs because Brooke has a link to him. And I was realizing that I really don't know a lot of the big words that he uses. I mean, I know I teach first grade and vocabulary doesn't really get up there, but man, I kinda felt um, uneducated. So, I think for the rest of the night I will read my dictionary, and maybe  urlLink every new blog entry  I can use a new word in a sentence pertaining to my day.The section will be dedicated to Ben himself, for he and his large vocabulary has motivated me. Here's my first attempt:  skulduggery:n. dishonest trickery. My first graders often indulge in skulduggery when they say, "I really need to use the restroom, it is an emergency," and then I see them wander down the hall to get....a drink. LIARS!  ...........................................................................................................  Have you ever had one of those days when you accidentally forget to take of that big sign on your forehead that says, "Ignore me, I have cooties." ? Yeah, that happened to me today. I went to this young adult Christian group with Tracy and three different times, a guy would come up and introduce himself to Tracy and say absolutely nothing to me, let alone look at me. So I would just stand there, attatched to Tracy's hip, nodding my head and trying to be interested in a conversation that I was so blatantly not invited into. Later, Tracy would introduce me. "Oh I'm sorry!" They would say. I was thinking, "That's right you're sorry! Ain't nobody that ignores Lesley, shoot!" So yeah, kind of a bummer night. Keep your eye out for the latest edition of Old Maid cards featuring......ME!  Thanks to Megan's fabulous Maui CD I purchased Jason Mraz, Maroon 5 and John Mayer. I just really enjoy them! Is John's Heavier Things album self-titled? Is it just me or does he look a little chubby?  I did have one positve encouragment today, one of my kids wrote a note to me that said, "I like you. You are nice. You are the best." Ahh, so sweet. Too bad when I first read it I was looking to make sure all of the words were spelled correctly along with punctuation! Is that wrong? I don't like boys. No offense if you are a boy. But then again, there probably aren't any boys reading this anyway because I have cooties. Mental note, remove sign from forehead.  ***********************************************************************************   JESSI DOBOS  "Bono For President"  Boyfriends. It is important for single women to completely abuse the word boyfriend, and use it shamelessly. Let me give you some examples:   Dead Rock Star Boyfriend: Jeff Buckley.   Live Rockstar Boyfriend: John Mayer   Gay Rock Star Boyfriend: Rufus Wainwright.  I also have four service industry boyfriends who work at four different places that I frequent. There are two waiter boyfriends. One is the lunch/near my office waiter boyfriend and one is the evening/near my house waiter boyfriend. This waiter is new, but he is quickly becoming my favorite. There is also a barista boyfriend, and a personal trainer boyfriend at the club.  ...........................................................................................................................................  SO, as I am walking to my place, with groceries in hand, I see up ahead what appears to be a medium sized dog, wandering around. As I approach, and am in my strange way of talking to animals as though they are humans "hmm, where's your house doggie...you shouldn't be wandering-oh my word! You're not a dog!" It was a VERY large raccoon. And it has turned and started LUMBERING toward me. I stomp my feet and make noise to scare it away, and it stand up on it's hind legs, makes creepy clicking sounds at me, sways back and forth a few times and basically CHARGES straight at me. In characteristic form, I scream like a school girl and bolt down the street as fast as I can. I realize suddenly how this must look to any potential spectators: a grown woman, running (and half panicked) from a woodland creature in a well lit, residential neighborhood carrying three bags of groceries, my gym bag and my purse in well-heeled "clip clop-clip clop" shoes at 11 o'clock at night.  .................................................................................................................................................

      So here I am in the Buckeye state once again.  Home sweet home...kind of.  New York is kind of home too now, so I'm severely displaced wherever I go.  I find myself saying things like "Well, in New YORK, they.." or "in OHIO, they..." I guess there are worse problems to have.  Like working at Cold Stone.  According to my new BFF Beth, that may not be a problem for that much longer, as the AE people seemed to like me.  RING, you stupid cell phone, RING!!!  Free me from my waffle cone bondage.  Ohio is great, or to be more specific, the people are great and the scenery is beautiful.  Everything else is as sleepy as ever.  So far I have gotten the opportunity to hang with some of my favorite people in the world, including my sister Kim and fam, my parents, ALL of the Pretty Weapons (including a roadtrip with Tony and the long lost Corey Darst) who are playing Friday night in Columbus at Ruby Tuesday (a club on Chittenden maybe?, not the family restaurant), Brandon's girlfriend Lindsay, Lesley Brandenburg, and even a surprise appearance by old neighbor andy Campbell and Jared.  I've played Mortal Kombat and Mario Brothers, eaten my weight in pizza, and been involved in a tsunami/typhoon in Columbus.  So far, so great.  I'll keep you posted.  Right now, I'm off to see if I can dig up a Teresa Edris.  Later on, it's nothing but good times at one Mountaineer Family Restaraunt with Randy Surface.  At this rate, anything could happen.  Jesse Smith could be there chain-smoking and invite me to re-form Zao with him.  And at this point, I just might.  PS: The guy I sat next to on the plane is really good friends with Dave Grohl.  I want to be really good friends with Dave Grohl!  (Friends that accidentally make out sometimes.)

      Ok, so Randy Surface recently posted a  urlLink blog  (that's the only time you'll ever read the words "Randy" "blog" and "recently" in the same sentence,) about how Rock and Roll is dead.  I have been mulling this claim over, and have accepted his invitation for rebuttal.  I have copied my email response to this entry for all to comment on, and ponder.  In the meantime, I'm going to go play guitar.  The email went as follows:   Surface--  Ok, ok.  I have put it off and put it off, responding to your blog.  I know that as soon as i hit "send," a bevy of more intellectually and culturally sound points will rush into my consciousness.  C'est la merd.  (Or is it merde?) I am also afraid of what tsunami of words will be unleashed once I start typing.  Get a soda and a nice snack for the journey of rambling I am going to lead you on, won't you?  Alright, so "Rock is dead." Is it?  I have spent an inordinate amount of time this week pondering the fine points of this claim.  I have committed more time than I care to admit delving deeper into finding a real position of assent/dissent, reading magazines like Mojo, Uncut, Q, and even Filter, the snobbiest of the snobby.  I have intentionally increased my MTV and VH1 viewing, and even my MTV2 viewing.  My VH1Classic viewing needed no tweaking, it was fine.  I have rifled through my CD collection and nosed around online.  I even listened to Nirvana's "Nevermind" in its entirety, although that one wasn't my doing, it happened to be on at my internship.  Any other time, I would have made a face, but this week, it seemed, well...serendipitous.  So what have I come up with?  No easy answers, but perhaps I come away at least feeling ready to speak to this issue in a more real way.  So here goes nothing: a subjective treatise from one of Music's most earnest fans, yet irritable critics.  I think that it is not wholly correct to say that Rock is dead. (I'll deal with irony, sarcasm, wit and kitsch later.)  If you are using the phrase "rock is dead" as hyperbole, that is to say making an absolute statement about something you don't absolutely believe in order to make a more gravitous point, that's one thing.  That's what I suspect you're really going for, in which case, that's really the end of the story.  We can all agree that there's a lot wrong with music today, and to throw one's hands up and say "Oh God, Oh God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is a reasonable, valid response to Avril Lavigne, Good Charlotte and Britney Spears.  The larger and perhaps more dangerous claim is to say that Rock and Roll music (herein referred to as simply "rock,") is in fact dead.  Dead is a serious implication.  Not only is the life gone, but it's never coming back.  Dead is not a headcold, not mono, not even a tiger-mauling (poor Roy) or a drug-induced coma.  It's dead...it's Jim Morrison, John Bonham, Sid Vicious, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, Ian Curtis, Janis Joplin DEAD.  Hmm, this sparks an interesting thought...surely our beloved Father Rock (and all its aforementioned deacons) was the one to first preach that it is better to burn out than fade away.  If rock were going to die, wouldn't it go out with a little more aplomb, a little more pinache, a little more F-you to the old man than just letting mother-effing New Found Glory and Dashboard Confessional and Hilary Duff crash the scene, shrug its shoulders and start chaperoning the "first boy-girl party" feel that the mainstream seems to reflect today?  I for one think Rock would have the good manners to at least choke on its own vomit or stab someone for looking at them funny, something to stick it to The Man one last time before taking a shit-ton (Matt's favorite unit of measurement, I think it's metric) of peyote and following the Indian man over a sand dune into the great beyond.  All of its disciples seem to have a good enough head on their shoulders to bow out with flair.  It's the rock thing to do.  Also, it's tough to give a musical genre as widespread as rock an official time of death.  Look to other genres for examples here.  Many people would say that Opera, Jazz, Classical, even Blues have ceased to have an impact culturally.  Many would say that their hey-day has passed, and maybe they're right.  However only the incredibly stupid or the incredibly brave would say something like "Blues is dead" or "Classical music is dead" in earshot of anyone with an 8th grade understanding of Popular Culture.  Why?  Because Lincoln Center exists.  Thousands of the world's most educated and music-minded people in the world flock there year-round to hear singers bring their "A-game" to the stage, and sing opera every bit as well if not better than it was sung 200 years ago.  In fact, some of the best, most critically acclaimed Operas in the world have been written in the last fifty years, performed by some of the most celebrated voices in the history of the genre, even though it's supposed "golden age" is through.  It may not be in the mainstream the way it was back when "La Traviata" was the Friday Night equivalent of "Troy," but of course it's still culturally relevant to many reasonable, educated, music-loving people.    Sidebar: So maybe rock isn't getting people vocal about the war the way it did for Vietnam, but there's also not a draft, or the longevity.  Perhaps this war or wars in general have ceased to have a cultural impact in the way they once did, because of how they're fought now...digitally, with fewer casualties, shown on world-wide TV to an anesthetized bunch of people who know they should be shocked, but have seen worse in video games.  Point being, maybe it's not rock's fault.  But back to our regularly scheduled opinion.     The same can be said for any of the afore-mentioned genres.  They were once all the darlings of their day...first chant, then classical (actually, first baroque, then classical, then romantic, then modern/20th century, then atonal/post-modern, and so on) then african spirituals for black folk and hymns/folk music for white folk, which turned into folk and gospel, which turned into blues and country, which turned into jazz and big-band and the birth of popular music, which spawned rock, yada yada yada, suddenly Carson Daly's too old to host TRL.  The point is, they were all the Gwyneth Paltrow of musical genres at some point: America's sweetheart that could do no wrong, in that moment where they seemed the perfect zeitgeist, the ultimate manifestation of "yes, this is who we are right now."  Then, inevitably, it would suddenly seem...dated.  Stale, like a couple who have already heard all of each other's stories a hundred times over.  Then something new would come along like a new baby, and everyone in the mainstream would coo and talk in high-pitched voices "Oh my gosh, isn't that Debbie Gibson just the cutest little thing???"  and pretty soon, the older genre was watching from the wings, remembering a time when everyone cheered everytime THEY took a crap.  I digress.  The point is, nothing has changed.  Rock snuck in behind one of Elvis Presley's hips (or maybe under Chuck Berry's pompadour, I'm not really sure)...and wherein other genres had been content to sort of just nudge their way in, rock decided to make knocking people on their asses its calling card.  (Even as I'm typing this, I'm shaking my  head, because I think this was true in the past in less obviously manifested ways.  When new brands of classical music would emerge, people would get PISSED...but they didn't usually burn anything down or pee on anything to show it.  It just wasn't done back then.  They mostly gave each other syphilis a lot and kept quiet.  I know that blues and jazz were thought of as the devil's music, so I guess rock wasn't the first new genre to get attention based on controversy, just maybe the most obvious or memorable based on its choice of means to the same end.)  Ok, so I said all that to say this: classical: still around.  jazz: still around.  every genre I've mentioned, even chant: still around.  By around, I mean that non-retarded people appreciate and seek out this music both new and old, and new works in these categories are being created daily.  So I think I've established a strong case that if Rock IS in fact dead, it's a hallmark, in that it would be the FIRST genre of music to die, possibly EVER.  I will agree with your implicit statement that rock is no longer the media darling, the Mary-Kate and Ashley if you will, of the day.  It's getting to the point where Rolling Stone is catering to bands they should never even spit on, and VH1 is doing "Driven" episodes on people who aren't even musicians.  I get what you're saying...rock as it was in the 50s, 60s, 70's, and even 80's is not the mainstream monster is once was.  It is possible that its heyday (at least its first heyday) is over.  It's like Narnia: Narnia's still around after the first book, but once Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are too old to come back, and all their step-cousins and third niece's neighbor once removed start having the adventures, you keep reading, but you know it will never be quite the same.  The golden age has passed.  Even I, in my limited time exploring Classic Rock (and just the title seems to imply the very same point i'm making, no?) can see that it's tempting to say rock is dead in the absence of all the passed-on supernovas, leaving nearly every legendary rock band one or two untimely deaths short of a true reunion tour.   It's easy to say rock is dead when two Beatles are dead, and one of the two left is Ringo. (Sorry, Starkey.)   Ok, so this has already become the longest thing I've ever written INCLUDING college papers, so I need to make a final point and rein (sic?) things in.  You've probably fallen asleep on your keyboard, and it's leaving little square red dents on your cheek as you drool all over the spacebar and letters c, v, and b.  I think so far we've established that rock isn't really truly absolutely dead.  So if it isn't dead, ....where the hell is it?  Is it hibernating? Did it get pissed at hip-hop and skulk off somewhere to drink a fifth of JD? Is it in a drug-induced coma?  Is it sleeping with Christina Aguilera? Almost certainly all of these thing, esepcially the last.  The thing is, I think that since we've come to terms with the fact that rock is not the "Soup du'jour" (mmm, that sounds good, i'll have that.) we must venture outside of the mainstream to find it.  It's like if your dog gets lost...you don't just stand in your front lawn and yell "Rover!" over and over again. (Especially if your dog is named "She-Ra," like mine was.)  You get out there and find that damn dog, like Billy Madison wisely advises.  Likewise, we must find rock.  I'll admit, I have the jump living in New York.  There are 100 percent more nooks and crannies that rock is likely to be hiding out in than in the MOV.  It should also be mentioned that your entire jaded perspective on all things cultural is most certainly being shaded by your current geography.  Ohio is AWESOME.  AWESOME.  But the MOV is a cultural black-hole, an almost-supernatural vacuum where long-term creative drive cannot exist.  Cynicism is the only fuel an intelligent person has to rise above the carnage of ignorance littering the streets (particularly 7th street) in the absence of fresh creative fire.  Beware, though: Matt Eiflers are created thus.  Be jaded enough to ask questions, but not jaded enough to think you know the answers.  Ooh, that sounded smart.  Again, and not surprisingly, I digress.  Rock is out there: in dark clubs with men's rooms so stank even Brandon Smith would be like "f--- THAT, dude, i'll pee outside."  It's out there in bands like the Pretty Weapons that would be playing MSG right now if it were 1974, but since its 2004 their record contract was given to some crapfest like Thursday or Yellowcard.  Rock bands exist, but they pretty much keep the food-service industry running, in that the industry is too scared to take a chance on something that's the slightest bit risky or less than saccharine, and as Mick Jagger once said, "It's only rock and roll if its not safe."  The same dumb chumps that think Kazaa and Napster ruined their year are the same guys signing all these losers.  They're like the ruler of some medieval kingdom where there's plenty of food out there and they (being the distribution system) are the real root of the problem, but instead they let the people starve, blaming it on everything but themselves rather than admit they're fallible.  The rock is out there, its just not getting to the people.  It's out there in thin disguises:  retro rock, indie rock, metal, folk rock, rocky road rock, rock mcrockerson rock, barbie and the rockers, jesse and the rippers, the zack attack.  i won't say hot sundae, they were clearly pop/r and b.  One thing the 90's taught us (wrongly, i'm learning) is that everything needs a label and a dissection a la 9th grade Biology.  It's not enough to be aware of something, we must be HYPERaware of it.  We must be able to not only talk about it but talk down to it, meaning that we end up destroying everything we love because we nitpick its every flaw like vultures of Popular Culture, then satirize it, then do it again ironically, then satirize THAT...then proclaim it dead and wonder how the hell THAT happened.  I think that in this generation of "i'm over it", we need to get over the last thing...ourselves... and realize that just as we love people who are imperfect not only in spite of but because of their imperfections, so it could once again be with culture.  We could hear a CD and love it.  We could go to a concert and let it blow us away.  We could take the red critic's pens out of our feverish hands and once again just be fans.  We could accept that yes, such-and-such artist IS a little derivative, and the lyrics aren't the best, but it MOVES us, it makes us feel something.  It has energy.  And that's the point: image yes, but mostly an unexplainable energy and bigger-than-lifeness.  Something that says something, or makes us feel something, or both.    So let's look for rock, it will be an adventure, a virtual roadtrip we as old friends can take via email, phone conversations and maybe even a couple trips to the Neer next week.    Places to look (add more to list): The White Stripes The Shins The Thrills Black Rebel Motorcycle Club The Pretty Weapons Radiohead The Warlocks Sigur Ros (not really rock and roll in the truest sense, but...worth discussing) Probot, anything involving Dave Grohl or members of Queens of the Stone Age, especially the ones who don't like each other anymore Little Richard (he was on Ryan Seacrest the other day and was phenomenally crazy and great) Velvet Revolver The Coral The Stills (sometimes) The Sounds (more new-wave, but in a punk-rock Blondie way) Brian Jonestown Massacre Jet (sometimes) The Darkness (the best argument for and against) The Eagles of Death Metal Death Cub for Cutie REM The Yeah Yeah Yeahs (Karen O. scares the Bejesus out of me, but I guess that's the point) The Black Crowes   and then if you want to get liberal with your def of rock, you could go Mayer, Mraz, Jones, and the whole cache of singer-songwriter folk-pop-rock songsters.  That's up to you.  I'm eager to hear back on this issue as soon as you wake up and wipe off your keyboard.  Thanks for your time.  I told you I would address irony, but I lied.  Anything that is not implicit in this email can be discussed over some garlic bread french toast at Le Mountaeneir.  And anyway, who could address it any better than Alanis already has?????  Hope all is well in your life.  Hmm...maybe I could shape this little discussion between the two of us up into a magazine article.  Maybe not...it's 4:41 AM, so I could type "hot dog, hot dog, hot dog" and it would look pretty smart and edgy.  Time for bed.  I'm sleeping in the chair because Megan killed the world's LARGEST cockroach in our apartment tonight, right by my bed.  I am suffering the repercussions of sleeping on bottom in our little modified bunk-bed set-up.  Seriously, it was the size of a Doberman Pinscher.  Megan hit it square in the face with a frying pan and it just looked at her and said "fuck off."  I am not joking.  She said at one point it RAISED ITS HEAD and looked at her.  They are not supposed to be able to do that, are they?  Raid was bought, screams were screamed...but in the end he's now dead, outside our door, in a now-useless tupperware container, and two grocery bags.  Check her blog for the complete annals of the life and times of the ill-fated king of the cockroaches.  I might put most of this email in my blog, if I feel up to it tomorrow.  Until then, good night.  Konichiwa (I don't know how to say goodbye in Japanese, just hello...I'm taking a long-shot chance that it's like Aloha, and its the same for both.)  Ooh wait...isn't it Sayonara?    Brookelyn    ps: my apologies for any excessive coarse language, or moreover, any typographical errors.  I blame both the late hour and my perpetual irreverance, both of which I am hoping you will find acceptable and endearing.  Also, I have been traumatized by a cockroach, and the lurking threat of more cockroaches.  If that doesn't make one want to swear, what does?

      There's no way to euphanize this, no way to make it seem merely cute or sardonic.  I hate working at Cold Stone.  I hate it.  I consider walking out roughly ninety times per shift, more if it's especially busy or a child is crying.  Poll: If I'm truly miserable, should I just go there tomorrow and quit, and work on securing another job more to my liking before I go home?  I supposedly have three more shifts: tomorrow night, Monday night, and Tuesday night, and I honestly just don't know if it's in me.  Especially Monday and Tuesday, because I'll be coming directly from my internship...that's like throwing a bucket of cold water on my dreams.  "Hey, your life is awesome!!! No...wait....my mistake! It's DREADFUL!!!!"  Someone talk me in or out of this.  I'm too tired to think.   I'm thinking about just standing very still with a far off look, and re-creating the scene from the Royal Tenenbaums wherein a drug-fueled Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) abruptly leaves in the middle of a TV interview....he just goes, "....I'm gonna go." And gets up and leaves in the middle of the broadcast.  If I thought even one person at my job would appreciate the homage, I would do it.  Life isn't all bad: my internship is amazing.  I get to speak with people like Kitty Boots (real name), the stylist on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and write nationally distributed press releases.  Never mind that they litter a newsroom floor somewhere.  It's littering the wastecans somewhere IMPORTANT.  Har.  Also, I'm going back to my lovely native Ohio next Wednesday, and the next two weeks promise to be absolutely blissful.  Roadtrips, barbeques, days off, laughing 'til it hurts, birthdays, drives, kisses, hugs, home-cooked meals, shopping, canoe trips, overdue reunions, naps on the deck swing, nights in the hot tub....all these things that I've missed will be done and done well.  Then I'll come back to New York and it will miraculously be June, and summer...my favorite season to live in New York.  And I should know...in two weeks, I can truly say I've been a New Yorker through them all.  I guess in some ways it truly feels like home now.  And that's worth enduring every dead-end job in Manhattan.

      ...to pick up some rock.  So, a wonderful, serendipitous thing has happened.  Out of no connections or talent of my own, God has decided to cut me a break for once and help me get the Pretty Weapons a show here in New York.  They've been trying to put together a tour, and I was charged with the unholy task of braving the biggest group of elitist, snobby people in the world: NYC rock club booking agents.  I emailed Joe, the booking agent for a club here called  urlLink Arlene's Grocery .  Arlene's is one of the top 10 prestigious clubs to play in NYC, behind maybe CBGB's, Bowery Ballroom, Irving Plaza, Roseland Ballroom, The Knitting Factory, and maybe the Mercury Lounge.  Long story short, Joe turns out to be a really unpretentious guy who wants to help out new bands, and voila!  The Pretty Weapons have their first NYC gig, Friday July 16th at 8pm at Arlene's Grocery.  Former artists to have graced the Arlene's Grocery stage since its opening in 1996: The Black Crowes, REM's Michael Stipe, Dashboard Confessional, Rufus Wainright, Joe Jackson, Vanessa Carlton, Beth Orton, etc.  Maybe this is the beginning of my illustrous career in Music Industry publicity and promotions.  Or maybe not.  Only time will tell.  In the meantime, I'm going to go play my guitar.  So I'll see you all July 16th, okay?

      ...Misadventures in Kabbalah.  I realize I should have a heart for Britney Spears.  I shouldn't love to hate her.  I should try to have compassion.  But she keeps doing crap like this.  Do people expect me to leave free comedic material alone? That's just talking loco.  This is an excerpt from a piece on today's MSN online News:  Lost in Translation  Britney Spears has a new tattoo, but apparently, something was lost in translation. The singer had some Hebrew symbols put on the back of her neck, but “they are absolute gibberish,” according to the London Sun. “She had hoped it would say ‘new year’ or ‘new era,’ ” a source told the paper. “It seems she’s got the words the wrong way round.”     General rule of thumb: only get a tattoo in a language you understand, no matter how cool you think it looks.   Sheesh.

      Tonight I called my friends Liz and Tony (Tony plays Bass for the Pretty Weapons, I know them through Matt) and in the course of the conversation, Tony mentioned that Corey (TPW lead singer, mutual friend) had been taking vocal lessons from me a few years ago, and was telling the other guys in the band about me, suggesting I might be of vocal help to them all.  According to Tony, he heard my description, looked at Matt, and said, "Wow, you two are going to get married."  He claims he was totally serious, despite the fact that Matt and I would not end up meeting for another 2 years.  I told Megan about it, and she said this:  "Ooh, he's a prophet!  I'm reading Deuteronomy, and in Deuteronomy, if a prophet was wrong, they could stone him, so if Tony ends up bring wrong, technically, you can stone him."  Now I love Tony, and I REALLY love Matt, but tonight most of all I love my roommate.  Heart.

      ...wait, life shouldn't be handing you anything, it's inanimate.  If life tries to hand you something, run.  These stories are becoming so common they aren't really blog worthy, so I'll give it a throw-away intro paragraph for background's sake and then cut to the chase.  My friend Kaelyn heard Ben Folds might be playing locally.  We did some sleuthing, and found out that he was indeed playing at Bowery Ballroom in the East Village.  Ticketless (of course) we go armed with 20 dollars each and disarming charm.  We find scalpers who offer 2 for 50 each (i think face value was 25?), and we finally talk them down to 20 each.  We feel like champs.  But alas! A spectastrophe lurks in the wings. WAIT! Did I mention that it had begun a deluge?  It was raining cats, dogs, and even woodland creatures. (I dodged a falling anteater around Spring Street.)  We proceed, two formerly-cute,  now-drowned rats (think Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall when he's on his scary Opium fueled ship voyage around the globe) to the door.   At this point, a very nice security doorman (whose name we later learn is Ray) informs us that the tickets are fake.  WHAT????  As you well know, Brooke Williams does not buy fake tickets.  He must be mistaken.  But alas again!  He was not mistaken...after a LOT of schmoozing with Ray, he slipped us some wristbands, and we're in.  80 points awarded to Ray for general decency.  The point of this blog is not to laud our success getting into a sold-out show, or talking our way out of a sticky situation.  Frankly, it's passe.  It's been done.  (See: every other entry.)  Instead, I would like to briefly discuss Ben Folds.  My love affair with his unique piano pop rock began my freshman year, when Bob Cantoni (my freshman year crush, and subsequent good friend) shared his passion for Ben Folds Five with me.  This culminated in a sunny June afternoon in 1998... my friend Kathi and I visited Bob at his dorm, Lincoln Hall. He was in anguish...one of his favorite bands (BFF) was playing a mere 20 minutes from his house, and he couldn't go! Or could he? At 4:15pm, he offers to pay for half of our tickets if we'll accompany him on a mad dash to Cleveland (3 and a half hours away) in the hopes of purchasing tickets at the venue and seeing Ben Folds at 7:30.  MIND YOU they weren't even the main act, Beck was.  But few things gave Bob joy like Ben Folds Five, and few things gave me joy like seeing Bob bubble over with glee in its purest form.  So off we went like a bullet in Bob's powder blue minivan with no backseat (removed for band equipment.) There were several points were Bob (frustrated by the never-ending parade of blaze orange construction cones that June inevitably brings,) swerved through the cones into the non-open lane, passing cars at 90 mph with an almost feverish urgency.  We RAN all the way from the LAST parking spot on whatever field they made us park in, seemingly miles away from Blossom Ampitheatre, to the box office.  We purchased our lawn seats and chased after Bob, who was uncharacteristically skipping/galloping/frolicking ever forward.  Counting the song we heard as we ran, we made it for three out of the four songs.  Aside from the pure look of accomplishment, satisfaction, and joy on Bob's face, the other thing I will never forget is this: that is the day I fell platonically in love with Ben Folds (Five or singular.)  I accumulated all of the BFF releases through my college years, even after I lost regular contact with Bob (although I ALWAYS, ALWAYS to this day think of him when listening to BFF, and probably always will.)  At some point, Ben Folds announced he was dropping "Five" like Justin dropped NSync, and going solo.  I remember the general consensus in my sphere of influence being, "mmm, not so good."  So I moved on into other seasons of musicality, and only rediscovered my taste for him in the last year,  thanks to the magic of illegal downloading.  So, long story long, it turns out his solo efforts are just fine and dandy. (Mostly dandy.)  The concert: I thought I would know maybe A song he performed, in that I haven't managed to pick up either of his new EP's, but it turns out it didn't matter.  He played some quality  new stuff, but ended up playing a BUNCH of old BFF songs like Philosophy, Army, Best Imitation of Myself, etc.  He performed for two solid hours by himself, no opening act, and kept everyone's raptured attention.  (I probably just scared the five year old inside of Mae Klingler by typing the word rapture.)  It was a raucous good time-- it felt like a piano bar, only instead of bad karaoke or show tunes, people were singing good power pop.  Highlights for me: The Luckiest, Underground, One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces, and the one/two punch of covers of George Michael's "Never Gonna Dance Again" (Wham?  Just George?  15 points for schooling me.)  followed up with The Darkness's "Get Your Hands off my Woman..."  KABOOM.  So yeah...he's an original.  No one else can make a piano rock like him, Elton John notwithstanding.  Here's to musicians that write what they are inspired to write, not what a record label or girlfriend or publicist or parent tells them they should sound like.  There are many more bands playing this week, but not an equivalent amount of dollars in my wallet.  Hey Bob, will you pay for half my ticket to see The Shins on Sunday, or Sondre Lerche on Monday?  We'll party like it's 1998.  ROCK OVER LONDON, ROCK ON CHICAGO. WHEATIES, THE BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS.

      ...or at least offers us a Band-Aid.  Ok, so you knew it would have to be an event.  We couldn't just "go" to Rockefeller Plaza and stand in the crowd and watch John Mayer perform on the Today show.  It's just not how things go down in our world.  It started normal enough--Meg and I meet her friend Michelle at the 51st street Station, and we walk the few blocks down to the plaza.  As we come up on it, we are instantly chagrined by two facts.    One: We seriously underestimated the broad appeal of John Mayer, because there were already about 194,598,498,549,847,853 people swarming around...like, a Justin Timberlake amount of people.  With signs.  Big ones.  At 6:30am!!  (The show doesn't even begin until 7am.)  Two: The concert was NOT in the usual Today Show plaza, but in the Skating Rink area (its only a skating rink in the winter, it becomes an outdoor cafe in the summer.)  We looked over the edge to see that many many barricades were set up, and fans had already been packed in there like cattle.  Moreover, fans were being ushered into MORE barricades wayyy up on the street level, and THOSE were getting full.  We'd be lucky to even SEE John.  Crap.  So, we take our spot about two-thirds of the way back on the street level, about three people deep, and find that John is already on stage warming up.  Two girls immediately come in behind us that REEK of tourism.  They're crowding us and jumping up and calling everyone they know on their cell phones to say that they're actually SEEING John Mayer.  I doubt this is possible, since WE couldn't even really see him, and we were in front of them.  Still, we were there, so we tried to be upbeat, and crane our necks to see him occasionally.  Then, Michelle (who works with Megan at J-Crew a mere 100 yards away) has a flash of brilliance.  She says, "I'm going to go work my Rockefeller connections."  She excuses herself from the cattle pen, and runs over to a man standing at the closely guarded main staircase, which they are of course not letting anyone descend.  They converse briefly, and she comes back over to tell us....."ok, we're down."  We clamor over the barricade amid shrieks of protest from the tourists.  We find the same man that Michelle was speaking to, who turns out to be the head of NBC Security.  He knows Meg and Michelle's boss, and apparantly name-dropping is more effective in New York than anywhere.  Also, I think he wanted to help out three cute girls and be the cool-guy "hero" of the story.  So he, with a big grin on his face (unusual for seasoned security) waves off all the other guards in his path who practically bow prostrate before him, and we follow him down the main staircase, with about 3,000 pairs of "Who are THOSE girls and why do THEY get to go down there?" eyes on us.  He leads us around the side, where he winks and says mischeiviously, "Now, you don't want to be TOO close, do ya ladies?"  He then leads us into a small VIP area.  Right...by...the stage.    So that's where we stayed, and where we subsequently met the Promotional director of WPLJ (my favorite NYC radio station) who gave us his card and told us to call him anytime we wanted to go to one of their many "Up Close and Personal Concerts" (See the entry "God rubs Salt in our John Mayer wounds) at the China Club.  He told us Jason Mraz will be there in June, so we're going to take him up on it.  Free private Mraz....not bad, sirs.  So then we stood with our new friend (and a couple of crazy ladies) and were on the Today Show at LEAST once (as confirmed by Lesley and Lea).   We also talked to the band a lot between songs.  Kevin Lovejoy, the keyboardist, was soo nice.  Scotty Crowe, the love of our life, looked snazzy (Chrome Cadillac belt buckle, fauxhawk, Roy Orbison sunglasses, thousand dollar sport coat over two-dollar vintage pink t-shirt, Diesel jeans) but had a lot to do, so was nice but hurried.  Michelle got J Cubed (the drummer, JJ Johnson) to give her a signed drumstick he had used.  The girl in front of me got a guitar pick directly from John with his silhouhette on it.  Meg and I now both want guitar picks with our faces on them.  The pictures we got are great, but the memories are even better.  Look out Mraz...you're next.

      ...is what I will call anyone who dares to leave ill-conceived comments on my precious blog.  Megan had an anonymous comment left on her blog...apparently, someone does not share the JT love.  I hope everyone knows to play nice.  I only have a couple short items tonight, and then off to bed.  Firstly, links are back! (Polite golf applause)  I figured out, thanks to Megan and Blogger Help, how to add links to a template that does not originally allow for them.  This improves my quality of life 8000 percent.  I am under verbal oath to write this in my blog, even though it is destined to be a "you had to be there" kind of scenario.  Tonight, I was talking to Matt on the phone (a rare treat this week since his cell phone's been broken), and I was expounding on my newfound love for Gillian Welch.  I mentioned that I was excited to find out she was only my age, not in her thirties as I had previously presupposed.  He responds, amused, that I always become excited when people I admire artistically are my age, and feel the need to mention it.  I suddenly realize this is absolutely true, and comment that he remains the most observant person I have ever met.  No idiosyncracy is too small to slip past his radar.  And he says gleefully, "You don't understand.  I am  Observo .  I'm an effing  detective .  And the gravity of just how true this is bombards me anew and I say, sort of in an "oh wow" hushed awe, "you  ARE ...you ARE Observo."  I guess something in the dramatic nature of my voice saying something we already fully well knew to be true, added with the implicit hilarity of Observo, was too much for him, because he laughed for like an hour.  And made me promise to put it down for posterity.  So there ya go.  Next: I was planning my trip out in my mind today, and remembered that the last time I was at my sister Kim's, she let me do some laundry in her new machine, and it was the best laundry experience I ever had.  It's very technologically advanced, and makes for a more thoroughly cleaned, and better dried garment.  Keep in mind I've been using over-used pay washers and dryers for most of the last seven years, so it was a little like Disneyworld.  But just a little.  Anycrap, I was thinking about just packing all my dirty clothes and washing them there when I fly into Akron and have lunch with her, but was suddenly stricken with the thought that they check all bags, and mine would be filled with dirty clothes, and wouldn't that be embarrassing if they cracked it open in front of me?  I only realized much much later that they have no way of knowing if I'm coming or going, and EVERYONE has all dirty clothes on the way back.  So they're probably used to a little bit of smelly sock action.  Nothing they can't handle.  Free laundry, here I come.    Anyone in CBus want to go to Red White and Boom Friday?  I have to recruit people for vh1, but then I want to watch the fireworks, and possibly watch a large amount of funnel cake disappear into my mouth.    Lastly: I cannot emphasize enough how sick I am of hearing people say that music sucks right now.  I AM SICK OF IT.  In all likelihood, this is a variation on the "rock is dead" hyperbole that Randy and I have been dialoguing about, in which case what people are really saying is that there's nothing good on TRL or Z100.  That statement is entirely possible.  But since when are we 14 year-olds who only know how to plug into those two sources to get music?  Top 40 radio and video shows cater to the lowest common denominator of the general public, and none of my friends really fit into that category, thankfully.  Now, that's not to say that an occasional work of greatness can't climb into the Top 40, just don't bank on it all the time, cause you're bound to be disappointed.  The truth is, most people LIKE Hoobastank's "The Reason," and New Found Glory, and Hilary Duff, because they've never been exposed to anything else, and some people don't care to be.  Music serves as a distraction for those types and little else.  Not so with us, dear readers.  Most of us eat breathe and poop music.  It is in our pores, in every day of our lives.  It challenges and comforts and changes us, and we probably all agree that even a single artist or song can change your life.  So it's not wrong to say that a lot of music is sub-par right now, but when was that not the case?  Have you never seen VH1 classic?  It's filled with TERRIBLE (but also some great) videos from days of yore. (And by yore, I mean the eighties.)  The point is, the exciting part is that there are MANY great artists making music today, and several emerging scenes of great musicians, image, and community, like alt-country or indie rock or even the resurgence of a more true-punk sounding rock.  Saying that all music sucks right now is like a man lying in his bed starving to death because he's too lazy to go out and find food at the corner store.  We don't even have to go that far!  LimeWire is great, purevolume.com is great, and if you don't know where to start, I'll be glad to help you find music that doesn't suck in any genre. So buck up, brothers and sistahs, I've found at least five new songs that enthralled me just this WEEK.  So get out there and find some soul food.

      ...I think that's my dream job.  I don't know if you know this show...it's one of several on vh1 with what I affectionately refer to as the "mo rocca" format, which is essentially piecing together a montage of soundbytes and quick-cut video, while an eclectic pallete of celebrities and comedians commentate.  I guess everyone freaked out so much over "I love the 80's" that someone at VH1 decided to make it into a regular series about whatever happened that week, and "Best Week Ever" was born.  I want to be a commentator on this show, and I think I would be really good at it.  Can you imagine Tracy Thomas and I sitting in the studio and someone asks us to talk about what we think of Britney getting engaged again?  And PAYING us for that???? And then airing it on VH1?  More like "Best JOB ever."    I heart vh1 a lot.  After all, they were nice enough to hire me (freelance only) to help cast for a show their doing in Cbus.  So I have them to thank for giving me a chance to go to Red, White and Boom, see Matthew, and the cast of my characters that constitute my CBus BFF's, drive, and put a nive big VH1 bullet point on my resume.  I get to see my NYC BFF's tonight, and do a little Bible study action with the fabulous Annie Grant, Megan, Summer Beth, and company.  AND I found out that Gillian Welch is playing Bowery Ballroom with Old Crow Medicine Show the week after I get back from Ohio.  Last night Ellen, (my new favorite person originally from Alabama) and I decided that we should stalk Orlando Bloom.  There were rumors circulating that he'd been seen coming out of the Mercer Hotel that afternoon, which is directly across the street from where I work.  We did a little poking around, but all was quiet, and even the Paparazzi had given up for the night, which is always a sign that you're too late.  (Is it sad that I know that?)  So we keep walking through SoHo, which is deliciously empty at night...just window shopping and enjoying good conversation.  We end up ALL the way over on the West side in part of the West Village, and Ellen says she knows of a good bar called The Ear Inn.  We go in to have one drink, and it ended up being a lovely place.  A woman named Eve Silver was playing an acoustic-electric and singing, with a drummer using brushes and a trombonist.  They were playing some old jazz tunes...the woman LOOKED like a middle aged white woman, but if you closed your eyes, you would have SWORN Billie Holliday was being channeled from the great beyond.  Absolutely phenomenal.    Earlier this week we found a great dive bar on St. Mark's in the East Village called Grassroots Tavern.  great jukebox, cheap beer and popcorn, and dogs lay in the midde of the floor on weeknights.  It is my new goal to explore every great dive bar the city has to offer with Ellen...two down!  What else was awesome, let's see...OH, I learned to play another Jason Mraz song and my favorite Gillian Welch song on the guitar, and wrote some more lyrics.  The internship is good.  Work is good.  Church is good. I stumbled across The Pretty Weapons CD on virginmega.com.  It's also on Amazon, Tower Records, etc etc etc.  It's surreal to see it there (although it's not OFFICIALLY released til July 13th, the pre-order page and picture/info is already up).  I'm QUITE excited to see Matty...it's been 25 days...but only 3 to go!  So I guess it really IS the best week ever.  Except Michael Ian Black isn't here making glib remarks about MY life.  YET.

      ...Going down the only road I've ever known...(which apparently is I-270)  I'm going back to the OH like Michael J. Fox went back to the Future.  Fast. I could not be more psyched.  I did not expect to win this award...I didn't even write a speech--oh, wait, here it is.  I just found it, type-written in my pocket.  "First and foremost, I'd like to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for this scrumtrulescent opportunity, I'd like to thank VH1 for giving me a job as a casting recruiter, even if it is only for three days, I'd like to thank Jessi Dobos, with whom all things are possible, I'd like to thank Matt Auxier for giving me a place to stay on his couch, I'd like to thank Brandon Smith in advance for waking me up dutifully every morning, handing me a cup of green tea, and letting me sleep in his most comfortable of beds as he heads to Jo-Ann fabrics at 7am, I'd like to thank Matt's other roommate Seth in advance for keeping the sex noises to a minimum as that really creeps me out, I'd like to thank AirTran airways for having such kick-ass fares, and lastly, I'd like to thank Ohio and its 11 million residents, for being awesome. Thank you."  This will all go down next Friday...question mark.  (I'm Ron Burgundy...?)  LET'S DO SOME BONUS POINTS, SHALL WE???  5 bonus points to you for understanding that reference to Ron Burgundy.  We'll use the honor system this time...if you knew it, then go ahead and award them to yourself.  15 bonus points if you can name 5 Vince Vaughn movies right now without any assistance. 43 bonus points if you've seen those five movies.  11 bonus points for commenting on my blog and telling me a random story about one of your high school teachers...like so.  (sidebar: all my Belpre homies will love this.  Mr. Suttle taught 10th grade World Cultures...he also taught Contemporary Social Problems.  Mostly, he taught us to fear the government, and his sketchy ways.  We always said that if World War Three dawned, he'd be out on the front lines in a lawn chair, sipping lemonade and singing "Here Comes the Sun."  He was known for his stoicism, but was closest to gleeful when speaking about the apocolypse, his favorite 6th period topic.  The man had a switchblade in his belt buckle.  We swore he was storing POW's in his supply closet...for good or evil purposes, we didn't presume to know.) Anyway, John Suttle was many things...crazy foremost among them.  He was a conspiracy theorist, a fatalist, and most likely a pot dealer, considering his Meigs County, Ohio residence.  Despite those things, he was also smart.  He always kept this yellow legal pad notebook of extra credit assignments.  The basic gist was, there were pages upon pages of hand-written questions.  Most were conspiracy theories or obscure questions that seemed like an answer must be available in this, the digital age.  So we would scour the internet for hours, because if you could answer a question, even ONE, you got an "A" for the term.  In four years at BHS, I never heard of a single person solving one of his little government riddles, but I also don't know anyone that didn't try at least once.  I don't know what random neuron firing in my brain made me just think about Mr. Suttle, other than the extra credit pages being somewhat of a similarly fruitless pursuit as my "bonus point" concept.  It's not like you can cash them in for anything...ooh, at least not yet.  Maybe i'm on to something here.  You're all very lucky that I'm no John Suttle...my bonus points are at least sometimes kinetcially attainable.   urlLink Mae Klingler's  blog is really funny.  She's an all-around delicious person. 3 bonus points for reading it regularly this week.  I'll leave you with this...I have been sending out more inquiries re: Pretty Weapons shows, and a woman from a great bar/club called Lit wrote me back to say she was interested, but this other band might play the date she was potentially going to offer them.  She told me to check out  urlLink www.battlecats.com  to see if they'd be a good fit with TPW. Well, as you know now if you just followed that link, it's in Japanese, and it's NOT a band..it's girl-on-girl wrestling.  So i'm like..."hmm." Is she messing with me?  Is she telling me that she is going to give the slot to female mud wrestlers over  urlLink Matt's band ?  So I write back and casually say something like "Hmm...the link you pasted is in Japanese, and features females wrestling.   urlLink The Pretty Weapons  support female wrestling just as much as the next rock band, but stylistically it might not be the best fit..but they'll take it if its all you have."  She writes back today with something like this: "Brookelyn-- The link I sent must not be right...but now I want to go to it to see the female wrestling.  I'll try to get them on the bill."  So thank you Japan, and thank you female wrestlers of the world...you broke the ice and probably got the boys a show.  Maybe we should have some on stage somewhere as an homage...beats the hell out of groupies.

      ...or Guffman.  Sometimes it seems they're never going to show up, but at least with God, I think the situation might be that I'm waiting at the wrong bus-stop.    I'm going to cry.  Or stab myself in the eyes with my fingers repeatedly while saying "stab, stab stab, stab".  I have tried to post three times, and each time have gotten all the way through a lengthy inspirational blog only to be thwarted in my attempt to publish more than the first paragraph.    Here's the postcard version: I'm reading a book called "Made to Count, Discovering What to Do with your life."  It's surprisingly good, they passed them out at church...Megan and Ravi are reading it too.  Point being, I was struck by a part that says that if you can accomplish your life goals on your own, they're not big enough.  It's only big enough if you can say "God, if you don't show up, I'll totally and miserably fail." So I assessed my life goals, and detailed them here for you.  I'll have my secretary type those up in memo form and get them out to you, just as soon as I get a secretary.    The basic gist was: get out of debt, do comedy in some capacity on some level, make a record this year, serve God personally and corporately, serve and love others, do publicity for my friends bands until they can quit their other jobs (if thats what they want), start an entertainment company (that will eventually be Uptowner Records, RANDY...we are buying that building) work for a TV station like NBC, MTV, VH1 or Comedy Central in a more regular capacity, contribute to publications that matter, (Kaelyn and i are starting an online Pop Culture magazine called FaMus, short for Fashion and Music), and go on tour, either as publicist or performer or both.  Fame, fortune...who cares.  I'm over them like a hipster is over everything.  Just give me a dirty rock club at midnight, a waffle house in Omaha at 3am, songs and words that will change lives and break stereotypes, and the ability to create something unique and meaningful.  And loved ones to share the journey....and maybe an RV?  And then at the peak of it all I'll move to Athens for a year or so and join CCC staff, and have the biggest freshman Bible study ever, because they heard I toured with Ryan Adams, and I own a record label, and I'm friends with Vince Vaughn...what?  I will be.   That's it...my dream life/ministry in a nutshell.  Here goes nothing.

      ...your favorite section is back after an NSync-worthy hiatus.  Me: "No, we're not thinking of the same place...this place didn't used to be a Denny's.  I've been in it, and the Denny's was bigger...and less mexican...than this place." Geoff Osterland: "things always seem bigger (and less mexican) in your memory."  (Geoff and I debating if Casa Del Rio, my favorite mexi-restaurant on the way to the Akron airport, was once a Denny's we used to eat at.)    My new BFF Ellen from AE:  Well, there aren't enough plates, so I guess I'll just put my food on my napkin. Russ who I also work with at AE: (in a "no fair!" voice) You got a napkin?!!! (Realizing we were "under-resourced in the plates and napkins department at the Hog Pit, our favorite Southern Bar/BBQ hang-out.)

      SO, the cell phone is once again working.  I dropped it on the ground and a few minutes later, voila!  Remember that piece of tech advice next time something breaks...shake it like an etch-a-sketch (or a polaroid picture, if you're an Outkast enthusiast), take it apart (be sure you have NO idea what the hell you're doing as you're disassembling this expensive device), and then drop as hard as possible on a porous surface, preferably sidewalk concrete.  Works like a charm.  Ok, so a few non-sequiturs and then I'm going to go see about playing some guitar.    -Dodgeball. Thought it would be good.  I was wrong...it was fan-freaking-tastic. -Vince Vaughn.  I forgot I was in love with him.  An open letter is coming soon. -Chris Parnell was at AE today.  He gave me a half-smile/headnod to acknowledge me. -I am 90 percent sure I got the Pretty Weapons another show, this one on Aug. 11th, in which major-label A&R and newspapers will be in attendance.  This sounds too good to be true.  Pray. Pray to the merciful God of heaven so Brandon Smith can quit working the graveyard shift at Jo-Ann Fabrics in Dublin, Ohio, and Matt can quit delivering pizzas for Dominos in Canal Winchester, Ohio.  It's just not right, folks.  Mostly the Jo-Ann fabrics part. -I applied for a temp job with vh1 in Columbus, so I could get experience and have an excuse to go home for a week or so.  I said I lived in Columbus.  I LIED, RICK.  What in the name of Brett Scallions am I going to do if she starts grilling me about this?  Answer: lie some more.   -This brings up an interesting idea.  I have been doing publicity for TPW, and I think I am going to put together a flier to send to some great lakes and new york area colleges programming councils this fall.  Just to see if there's interest for booking college shows.  I used to be president of UPC, so I know how it works.  You basically get a flier and decide if they seem like someone you might want to book, and the reps call you and bug the hell out of you until you're either like "no, never" or "yeah, ok."  The nice part is, its good money and transportation and lodging are usually paid for.  If you are a) my friend, and b) a musician, then give me your info and I'll draw something up for this and send them all as one package.  It will seem more legit if I look like I do publicity for more than one band.  Randy and the Helvetica gang and Mae, I'm specifically thinking of you...but the more the merrier.  Even friends of friends.  It's a no-risk idea that could pay off in big exposure. -Happy "I made up my birthday" to  urlLink Ben Scragg .   -John Mayer is playing live with BB King as we speak less than 50 blocks from my apartment.  That is not okay.  Whomever is IN the club hearing this does not appreciate it as much as I would.  John Mayer needs to never play shows in New York, because they more often than not ruin my life....HOWEVER... --LIONEL RICHIE is playing the Good Morning America concert series in July.....oh, sweet Lord, the sweetest moustache in motown is coming our way.  I am going to start staking out my spot tomorrow.  I am going to make a sign that says "I had your cousin Joe for T-Com...and I'm in love with you."   --I can't BELIEVE I haven't had any offers on the "send me to Ohio" prize pack.  It is a treasure trove of tasties. --The album is progressing.  Title, lyrics, album art, all pretty much done.  I just need to figure out how to be good at guitar, and write killer accompaniments, and I'm all set.  I think that's enough non-sequiturs for now. I'm sorry if I failed to wow you.  I just came home from work, so I am thinking in AE binary code (instead of 1's and 0's, its all cargo shorts and tube tops) so it's like....cargoshortcargoshortcargoshorttubetoptubetoptubetopcargoshorttubetopcargoshort running through my head.    In the spirit of Mae Klingler's jr. high diary share, I will leave you with a list of my top five crushes in junior high/early high school.  1. Corey Yon.  (i think it was required, like Earth Science, or Gym.  You just DID. And years after, even once we'd become acquaintances, and were both at OU, I could NEVER speak to him without turning a really unhealthy color of purple/ashen, and feeling like I was maybe having a tiny stroke.  My nerves were just conditioned to freak out...like a Pavlovian response.  I think he's married...but if I saw him today, I would still act geeky, and still trip over my words.  And I still think he's the cutest boy to ever go to Belpre High School.   2. Zach Klein.  Zach Klein was tall, irreverently sarcastically funny, and smart.  We were on quiz team and in plays together.  We had classes together.  He was my lab partner.  We were pretty good friends...I never so much had a swoony type of crush on Zach..it just seemed like a good fit (off and on, sometimes I just thought he was a dork).  Being 5'9 and a half, The height (6'5") was probably the attraction.  Also, he played basketball.  Last I heard he was interning at the Capitol in DC.  Ben hangs with his brother a lot.   3. Bobby Cox.  I have always been good friends (and classmates) with Bob's brother Steve, who in retrospect looks and acts EXACTLY like Bob.  I don't understand why then I had no attraction whatsoever to Steve and thought Bob was "like, SUCH a hunk."  Word got out on the street about this and I suffered much embarrassment from Steve and others.  I was a dorky freshman, he was a popular senior.  Also, I knew NOTHING about Bob.  NOTHING.  Sheerly physical attraction.  It was very Sixteen Candles, except if Molly Ringwald was eventually like "forget it." 4.  Jonathan Brandis.  We all know how this one turned out. 5.  Nick Sargent.  Nick and I dated twice...once before he told me he was bi, and once after.  We were high school soulmates, in the sense that two people that like men can be soulmates.  I would still be BFF with Nick, except he was born without the part of his brain that follows through on anything, so he can't call people back or stay in touch.  With anyone...so I don't take it personally.  Amazingly, this was the least embarrassing of all of the "Awkward years" romantic escapades.  He was also the only one out of the five I ever kissed...the gay one.  Junior High is funny that way.

      ...is next year's VMA winner.   The Pretty Weapons CD (self-titled, Uprising Records) is now officially finished and RELEASED!!!  The guys need to recoup expenses for recording, etc...so if you are a fan of rock, The Pretty Weapons, or even a friend of ME, please buy one.  If you're interested, leave your comment here or call/email/IM and I'll make sure the transacation goes down smoothly.  You can listen to snippets  urlLink here . Another benefit (for my NYC BFF's) is that when they play Arlene's Grocery in less than one month's time on July 16th, you will be the hipster that knows the songs already.  How very Rock and Roll of you.  And now, for Beth:  Beth, you are awarded 40 bonus points for a very close attempt at "Montani Semper Liberi."  Montani Semper Liberi translates "Mountaineers are always free", and is the West Virginia state motto.  (Probably because the state was founded after breaking apart from the then-confederate commonwealth of Virginia during the Civil War.)  However, I would never have known about the phrase unless I had become a regular at West Virginia's premier 24-hour truck stop, The Mountaineer Family Restaurant, or the Mountaineer for short, or "the 'neer" for shortest.  The Mountaineer is a magical place where french toast is made from italian garlic bread, and the Ribette sandwich is not just a seasonal tease the way it is at McDonald's.  It has now been my favorite hang-out for almot a decade.  I miss it.  I miss it's blue-and-gold paper placemats featuring a map of the state with helpful facts like "state bird" and "state flower", and featuring towns I did not know existed, like "Romney."  THAT is where I learned of "Montani Semper Liberi" and where it's truth first struck deep into my heart.  And Randy Surface's heart.  And Ben Scragg's heart...and Matt's heart.  And pretty much everyone's heart I know from the Mid-Ohio Valley.  Someday I will take you there, Beth.  And the Mountain Dew will flow like Milk and Honey.  Also, I really enjoyed you note at AE.  The incredible amount of hearts were great, as well as the phrase "when I'm feeling (drawing of a handgun), you make me feel (drawing of a heart..)  Aww, BFF's.    Off to NOT THE FREAKING FREE JOHN MAYER CONCERT.  My life is ruined.

      ...tonight was monumental in the sarcastic sense of the word.  I have been complaining all week that I've been at AE Soho for nearly ten days and have yet to see a singular celebrity. I'm talking ANY celebrity...C list, D list...no one.  I supposedly missed Mike Myers, Will Smith, and Eric Nies.  What does it say about me that out of the three I would be most excited about Eric Nies?  I mean, he used to host "the Grind." God, what a good show. Teresa and I had a copy that we used to sit around a lot and watch...notice I didn't say "exercise to"...mostly we just wondered aloud how people could dance with six layers of "street" clothing on.  Also, Eric Nies was cute...he probably still is, unless he has ruined himself on one of those "Real World/Road Rules Challenges".  I used to have a calendar of him in like 9th grade...remember, Sarah?  SIDEBAR: Megan and I were watching the John Mayer/Paul Simon special, and JMoney was talking about how he once emulated Michael J. Fox, and sent him a fan letter as a child.  Megan said she'd never sent anyone a fan letter.  Sarah and I sent one to Jonathan Brandis...and he hanged himself.  Sure, it was 11 years later, but I feel terrible.  Maybe we weren't encouraging enough..if only we'd driven home how truly dreamy he was, or how much we enjoyed "SeaQuest, DSV" and "Sidekicks".  Our tendency to unintentionally kill celebrities and heads of state is long-running, but unintentional, I assure you.  It all started one night, when I was sleeping over. She and I (And most likely Ben) were in the basement talking, and someone mentioned George Burns.  I say loudly, "Is he still alive?"  We all laugh, no one knows.  We move on.  The next morning, we trudge upstairs to scavenge for food, and the newspaper on the kitchen table reads "GEORGE BURNS DEAD AT 100".  We look at each other slowly...and then Sarah quietly and with great gravity says, "we killed George Burns."  Oops.  A few weeks later, Sarah Mindy and I were rehearsing "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" for one of our upcoming engagements (probably something pretty classy like a Belpre Civitan Club meeting) and we noticed that the song was popularized by the Andrews Sisters.  Once again, we open our big mouths and Sarah asks if they're still alive.  Lo and behold, guess what we read in the paper the next day...one of the Andrews sisters died.  We're just knocking people off left and right.  It happened again several times over the years, and we're pretty sure we were responsible for Reagan, although we're not sure how.  Bob Hope was definitely me. Ray Charles was Ben.  Okay, so back to..what was I talking about? Oh yes, Celebrities at AE.  So tonight I get shuffled around a lot...I keep getting called to different rooms to cover people's breaks.  I go to room 5, a men's room with some dressing rooms that look like pods or spaceships or something out of Cocoon.  I think they might take off through the roof at any time.  Anyhow, it's pretty packed and I'm trying to keep order in the jungle of people screaming for a different size of chino from inside their space pod.  Around this time, a very entertaining young gay couple comes in and begin trying on clothes.  They are asking my advice, and we're having a nice laugh.  I notice a guy go into another pod.  He sort of gives me the "here i go into here and i'm not waiting for you" wave of acknowledgement.  This is fine with me. I say to the couple, "that guy is in a band." They go, "how can you tell?" and I say, "two reasons.  one, my boyfriend is in a band, and I can spot them a mile away.  Secondly, he looks vaguely familiar.  He looks like he's in...I don't know, like Fuel or something." I finally extract myself from my new BFF's just as another girl waltzes into the last dressing room..i give her a tag and offer assistance on sizes.  At this point, the guy (whom she was with) comes back out...I offer my assistance to him, and by this time have 70 percent talked myself out of him being in a band...but he does look familiar..i say non-chalantly, "you look...familiar." to which he says, "that's because I'm in the band Fuel."  Duh.  Of course you are.  You're the lead singer of Fuel.  He looks at me as if I'm going to rush him in JT-worthy tears.  This irks me a little, so I sort of lie and say, "hmm...yeah, i'll admit that I don't really know any Fuel songs." He says, "that's okay" and as I'm folding I say "so give me one Fuel song I should know." and then starts listing them.."Hemmorhage in my head" is the only one I remember, he was sort of mumbling and avoiding eye contact, like I was trying to take his picture or something.  So I go, "oh, are those your favorites?"  And he goes, "no, they're just the hits." and I say, "so what ARE you favorites?" and he says, "MY favorites are all on Led Zeppelin albums."  FINALLY.  He says something worthwhile.  I say "Well, those are good favorites to have..let me know if you need help finding a size" and wander away, back to the BFF's who are thrilled to hear the entire exchange and end up buying four items.  Fuel guy only bought one, and didn't even tell the cashier I helped him.  AND his girlfriend was HANGING on him like an orangutan while they were in line.  Ick.  so yeah..he didn't seem that eager to make a Fuel fan out of me, not that he could have.  It's just that, if I had an album out (which I will in a year, or I'll shoot myself) I would sure as hell be excited to tell ANYONE about it who seemed even half-interested in knowing more about my art.  Bad hustle, Fuel guy. What is that guy's name?  Now I have to Google search it, or lose sleep.  Hang on, please...  AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Wow. Wow.  His name is...Brett Scallions. BRETT SCALLIONS!!!  That is such a made-up name!  I can't believe it!  That's like being called Rick Mashed Potatoes.  Wow! I wish I had known that while I was speaking with him!  Brett Scallions.  That's a gem. That's a porn name.  That's a name you make up for a skit. That's up there with the great fake names of all time like Schooly McBooks or Chimpy McGee or Big McLargeHuge or Rick Moustache (my new name for greasy looking guys on the street with gold chains and of course moutaches)or Jimmy Sundial (Russ's old roommate's nickname) or Ronnie BigRig.  (Ok, the last one is real..or at least that's what Matt's neighbor calls himself.)  I'm going to go try to call my boyfriend.  Who wants to buy me a ticket to Ohio? I KNOW I was JUSTthere, but I miss him. Six weeks is too long when there's another six weeks sandwiching the visit in either direction.  So...if you buy me a ticket, I'll do a dance for you...a really funny dance.  And I'll write you a song, with YOUR NAME IN IT.  That's right, personalized for you!  It only has to be one way, I have a voucher for the other way.  That's like, what, 75 bucks?  The price of a cup of coffee...in New York.  Hmm, what else can I do to sweeten the deal?  Let's see...I'll...come visit you...and no one else (other than Matt) while I'm in the OH.  I'll...hmm.  I have a really great picture which I took of Justin Timberlake at one of his shows...you can choose from an assortment, and tell people he played your birthday party.  They are that close. I'll frame a hand-written copy of the lyrics of the smash hit "Who Stole My Ass", and even sign it..I'll bet Ben Scragg will sign it for you too.  I'll give you a Spiewak t-shirt, a sticker, or a keychain coinpurse.  YOUR CHOICE!  I will burn you a CD with ANY SONGS you want on it (except Britney Spears or any punk/pop) And I will make you a customized t-shirt that says "I am RAD!" with a thumbs-up..and possibly feauturing a graphic of Corey Feldman on it. I will pass along some magazines I'm done with...like Nylon, Mojo, Rolling Stone...good stuff. Also a dollar in pennies, which will spell out your name (with an exclamation point, but only if there are enough pennies. If not, then just an understated but classy period.)Last but SO not least, I will throw in my vinyl copy of "We are the World."  Wow...that's a prize package worth well over a billion defunct centimes.  (Which is roughly 75 dollars, i think, depending on the strength of the yen, I'm not really sure.) Thats: a personalized song a dance a gen-u-ine picture of JT in concert an exclusive visit by ME, Brooke Williams, friend of BRETT SCALLIONS! framed WSMA lyrics, HAND-SIGNED Spiewak swag burnt CD gently used hipster periodicals customized t-shirt (Corey Feldman not guaranteed, seasonal offering) a dollar in pennies (you can never have enough!) which i will arrange to spell out your name (a one dollar value!) We are the World VINYL, original pressing! (Let's not forget that Lionel co-wrote it)  I expect at least four offers by the end of the day.  First come, first served. For the record, I really would be willing to trade all of those things for a flight home.  Let's see if anyone still believes in good old fashioned barter.  I can throw in some more stuff if you feel the deal is not "sweet" enough, even though "We are the World" on vinyl is about the sweetest thing anyone can possibly possess.  Let's negotiate.  I'll try to think of some more things to throw in.  You think about the fastest way to get in touch with me.  I'll leave my cell phone on tonight so you don't have to wait 'til morning.  I know you're itching to get your hands on that Spiewak coin purse.   Alright, I've lost my mind.  I need a quiet time, a shower, and bed.  Fast. Vaya con Dios.  ps: one of Ben Scragg's Dollars to whomever can first tell me the literal translation of the Latin from my previous post, and forty bonus points for telling me specifically where the phrase made its way into my consciousness.

      ...Southern Rock Wednesdays are a much better office tradition.  Sigh...I am almost certainly never going to hear from some of you ever again after this one, but I've been cooped up in front of a computer all day, so screw it.   It was kind of a crazy day here at the Spiewak offices.  The more I'm here, the more I like it.  The day started off quietly enough.  It should be mentioned that for the past three days in a row, I have run into people I know on the way to work.  That makes me feel like New York is a little less faceless, a little more homey.  Maybe I'll get to the point where I know enough people that it ALWAYS happens.  That's a goal, I guess.  Anycrap, so I put in my freshly burnt CD of mostly alt-country for the marketing office to enjoy, and some other lovely surprises.   Track listing:  Jason Mraz--Flying my guilt over a quilt (DL this IMMEDIATELY) Norah Jones--Seven Years Iron and Wine--Such Great Heights (Postal Service cover) Jonatha Brooke--Bleecker Street (where I eat lunch on break from AE, so this                     is a new favorite of mine.) Gillian Welch--Look at Miss Ohio The Carpenters--Rainy Days and Mondays  ...at this point, all hell broke loose.  We started talking about the Carpenters, and the room was somewhat divided between people with great affection for the Carpenters and their brand of sad schmaltzy pop, and those that just couldn't get behind their sad schmaltziness.  Chris said "but they're just so...SAD." To which i said, "well, right...they didn't exactly have a happy ending as a band, either though." to which Josh said "Wait, remind me what happened..." to which I said, "Karen Carpenter died of anorexia." to which the entire room exploded in laughter.  Now, before you hate everyone I work with, remember that they are male, hipster guys who had been typing at their computers and basically not talking until I came in, and for some reason, that had just hit some weird button of release that sent everyone into giggles.  Then Extremely Funny Dan came in from the design office to tell us that one of the bosses was out that day passing a kidney stone, and very solemnly asked if we should maybe have a moment of silence.  Eruption.  Including Dan, who had been making light of the situation to begin with.  He then proceeded to ask what we'd been talking about before he came in, and I said, "we were talking about the Carpenters" and Dan says, "oh, I LIKE the Carpenters!" and I add, "and how Karen Carpenter died of anorexia."  Pause.  Dan bubbles over with giggles.  This sends everyone into a second wave of hysteria, and I can do nothing but shake my head and say, "aww, you guyyys" as I myself try to stop laughing.  So as we then discussed through laughter how inappropriate it was to be laughing at such a tragic disease/death, especially of someone we genuinely like/admire, we began to discuss other things that are horribly offensive yet funny.    This is when the dead baby jokes started. It's not a typo.  Dead baby jokes.  If someone OPENED a conversation with a dead baby joke, it would surely get them shunned from any social circle. However, building off of the earlier conversation, the laughter only got louder.    Here are two highlights from the barrage that followed: Q: What's grosser than a pile of dead babies? A: One live baby at the bottom, trying to eat his way free.  Q: What's funnier than a dead baby? A: A dead baby in a clown costume.  Eventually Josh ran out of jokes...I sarcastically remark that there's probably a website of dead baby jokes and he should look them up...to which Dave retorts "there is, and i'm looking at it right now."  More jokes, more laughs. Eventually, we move on and do some actual work and listen to the rest of my CD, which goes something like this.  Alannah Myles--Black Velvet Iron & Wine--Call Your Boys another Iron and Wine song--he's a 9th grade art teacher with a big bushy beard who looks NOTHING like someone who would be on SubPop, but he is and he's amazing. Guns and Roses--November Rain (G and R....sigh...they were SO SO good.) some Jack White song...can't remember which one Jolie Holland--I Wanna Die Gillian Welch and Ryan Adams--Revelator Sam Cooke-- A Change is Gonna Come Ryan Adams--Sweet Carolina Ben Folds--There's always someone cooler than you Roxette--Listen to Your Heart  There's one more song...maybe Patty Griffin?  Anyway, we listened to that, and then some Johnny Cash, and then some BB King and Jimi Hendrix, then JUST Jimi Hendrix, then the Allman Brothers, CCR, some more G and R, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and various other good things of that nature.  then we did some more work.  Then we ate lunch and Chris, Sabah and I watched some Teen Girl Squad.  Then more work.  I am mentioning the work so you don't imagine that we are a bunch of sluggards who laze around the office talking Pop Culture.  Work does manage to get completed in a rather kick-ass fashion, once we get done watching funny things online and looking up jokes.    Did anyone catch the John Mayer/Paul Simon special on VH1 last night?  Really really exceptional.  Exceptional enough to keep me from a nap despite my eyelids seeming to weigh roughly as much as Delta Burke.  Which is to say I was tired.  I'm better now, having watched a little Footloose (gotta love games of chicken played on tractors scored to Bonnie Tyler) and went to bed at 10:30pm.  I don't think that has happened literally in years. Three cheers for sleep.     Off I go to the Regal Eagle.  SIDEBAR: I once visited Ben Scragg at his former part-time position at Regal Cinemas, and begged him to answer the phone "Regal Eagle."  He complied, to my glee.  I think the person hung up, thinking they had mistanly the local watering hole of a 1970's sit-com.    My only complaint about work: both places I work are so cold, like the very antithesis of hell.  It's ninety degrees outside, and I'm wearing one of our samples of a Police fleece, STILL freezing.   Matt's thinking of going back to school, and completing his degree at WVU-P.  To that I say, "Montani Semper Liberi."

      I thought of some more Pet Peeves.   -When I order something without Onions or something and it comes out with it anyway, OR I forget to order it without and then it's my fault that I have to sit there and pick through my salad, pizza, etc.  If that happens, you can never pick the stuff off to a satisfactory level...there's always an after-presence in taste and texture that whispers, "hey...i was here." -When I order Sweet Tea at a restaurant and they bring unsweetened tea and some packets of sugar.  The granules never dissolve correctly because as we all learned in Mr. Craig Rabatin's Physical Science class, cold water does not saturate...things will not dissolve in it completely.  Oh yeah, and if they put a lemon IN the drink...forget it.  I may as well just pee in a glass, add an undissolved packet of sugar and drink it, cause the possibility of enjoyment is roughly -14. -Poor cell phone reception -People who like "Fear Factor." -When you get gas (this is when I still had a car) and a little gasoline gets onto your hands or clothes and you walk around in a stinky bad trip off the fumes for the rest of the day. -When people confuse John Mayer and DMB or John Mayer and Jack Johnson. -When people confuse *NSync with the Backstreet Boys.  Not cool. -When I'm obviously upset, irritated and/or angry, I hate it when people say "ok, deep breaths." or try to hug me. -When a baseball game pre-empts a show I wanted to watch...baseball in general, especially the Yankees. -Pennsylvania.  Or at least driving through it.  I don't know how you lived there, Jessi...it makes me want to stab my eyes out.  ok, did I miss any? Your turn...comment away.

      ...no, wait, I'm looking in the mirror.   To say I'm exhausted would be an understatement of epic proportions.  After my internship, I'm going home and napping like a champ.  That said, I've decided to power through the rest of the afternoon and blog while I'm at it.  I think it might be time for a list of pet peeves.  Don't you think?  Brooke's Pet Peeves (a non-exhaustive list) -When people or magazines try to be too-cool-for-school, or in New York terms, "so over it."  I think liking things is the new black...try it on for size!  -burning your taste buds like i did yesterday, which plagues you for the rest of the day. -Dropping my Wendy's junior bacon cheeseburger on the ground in front of everyone I work with just before taking the first delicious bite.  (Ok, this isn't so much a Pet Peeve, more of an "oh, crap."  Luckily, everyone in the Spiewak marketing office was like "Ten second rule...if you don't eat it, i will." I ate it.  The floorburger was fine. -When people buzz our apartment to get in the building, but aren't coming to our apartment. We're the first people listed on the door buzzer, so it happens with irritating frequency.  The door buzzer is the LOUDEST, scariest thing ever. (Ask Matt sometime about our door buzzer striking fear into his heart at 7am last December.) -When people complain about not seeing their boyfriend/girlfriend for a day or two.  F off, hookers. -Poor subway etiquette/ those kids that are selling candy for their "basketball team."  Chief, you are 25 years old and wearing designer clothes.  Not to mention that no one plays school basketball in JUNE.  Bad hustle. -Those little Urban Outfitters ruffly skirts that are so short you can actually see a little butt cheek if you really look.  Not original, not cute. -Computer Pop-ups. -Burger King.  Everything about it sucks.  Screw off, BK.  If I had it MY way, you'd all turn into Hardee's or Skyline or Chipotle or something rad. -Guys that make kissy noises at you when you walk past them.  (This has happened TWICE this week!) Uber-ew. -People that aren't good at swearing. -Christian T-shirts (except for two.  I like the ones Sarah used to have..do you remember these, Sarah?  One said "God is dead"--Nietchze and then below it, "Nietschze is dead"--God.  That's funny.  I don't care who you are.  Also, she had one with a Far-Side style cartoon of a milk carton that said "Have you seen us?" and then under it it said "Post-rapture milk cartons."  The idea of one photograph of millions of Christians who all happen to be standing together, added into the idea of all of them being looked for kidnapping style is also really funny.)  But all of the other ones can eat it. Don't be a nerd.  No one likes nerds.  God likes nerds, but only because it's  in his job description.   -Tourists..or at least the ones with fanny packs. Didn't anyone forward the memo about it not being 1988 anymore? Cripes. -typographical errors/ poor grammar and usage (Belpre TAG folk, remember MUGS? Usage Grammar Spelling...what was M?  Marketing?  Marietta?  Magdelene? Milk? Margeaux?  Marseilles?   What are YOUR pet peeves?   in other news: Corey is no longer in the Pretty Weapons.  The band is still together, and will still be playing their upcoming shows...it looks like at least for now Matt will be singing and playing lead guitar, Tony will move to rhythm guitar, our very awesome friend Matt McKernan will move into bass, and Brandon will still drum.  This is all extremely tentative, but the band is excited to move forward no matter what the line-up. -When people ask if they can smoke a cigarette around me in an attempt to be polite or sensitive, but will light up a joint around me without asking. In a related peeve, people who smoke (especially weed) at live shows where we're all packed together in a small space and have no choice but to breathe it secondhand.  I'm going to start shoving sub-par food in people's mouths violently at shows and be like "well, I was hungry, so I just assumed you wouldn't mind being force-fed." In still other news, I got to be a stylist for a photo shoot today,and photographer.  Don't get excited, we had to shoot the new NYPD jacket that Spiewak is producing this fall.  There wasn't a model or anyhting, just a jacket. Still, it was fun.  I tried to look appropriately funky and aloof like a stylist would.  Lastly, I'm going to an ElleGirl party at some penthouse next week, Ambulance LTD is playing.  Anyone in the NYC area want to go?  Megan and Victoria, I put your names on the guest list already.  Internships have their perks sometimes...i get shloads of free magazines (Filter, Nylon) and invites to free industry parties where no one has to know I'm an intern.  Fun times!  I'll leave you with the quote of the day, and then it's back to my internship. "Did you go to Taco Bell?  It's on Crackhead row down there on 8th Avenue...were there lots of crackheads hanging around outside, like, arguing over a band-aid? (In crackhead voice) "That's my band-aid, fool...gimme mah band-aid, that's my band-aid."" --Josh Chapman, the Spiewak PR director with whom I work.

      Ok. Ok. Ok.  I need to take a few deep breaths before I blog this, or I will again break down into fits of uncontrollable giggles.  Tonight, our friend Garrett mentioned over IM that someone he and Megan used to work with at the John Walsh show got a new job as a Production Coordinator for a new show for the fall NBC lineup (PC is a sweet job, btw..so kudos to that guy).  What's the show, you may be asking?  The Tony Danza show.  I'll give you a three-second grace period to come up with as many jokes as you can. . . . OK. Don't cheat off of your neighbor's paper.  What's the ONLY appropriate response to that news?  The answer:  "So...it turns out that Tony Danza really IS the boss." We would have also accepted "It will be mass confusion in the office...no one will know who the boss is," or even "Who's my boss?  Tony Danza! (begin singing 'hold me close, now tony danza')"  Garrett didn't think any of these responses were funny.  I'm SO applying to work on the Tony Danza show. So's Megan.  I think Danny Pintauro will probably be a Production Assistant...effing tv-family nepotism.    There is only one way this could be funnier.  ONE.  And that is if the competing shows in that time slot are the Scott Baio show on ABC and the Bruce Springsteen show on CBS.  Think about it.  God, I want Charles in charge of me.

      ...in desperate need of some change.  Ok, so do you like the facelift?  Ben and Megan inspired me.  I'm sick of the Orange and Green staring back at me, although it did remind me of He-Man's trusted cat, Cringer that used to transform into...well, whatever he transformed into. A Thundercat?  No, I don't think so...he had a name.  Rick?  Was it Rick?  Ok, so here's the deal.  American Eagle. Great.  Grand. Fantastic.  The people are awesome, they play The Thrills and Sondre Lerche (and even the occasional JT) on the speakers, and I get to wear t-shirts and flip-flops.  The downside?  I've been working ten hour days (2-12) EVERY DAY.  I'm exhausted.  My life has ceased to exist from beyond those four walls.  I get up, I have a pop-tart, and get ready to go to Soho.  This will continue until Thursday, where I will have two glorious days off and get to see John Mayer for free.  Life will have meaning again.  The upside: i mentioned the people and the music...today is "beach party day", where all employees dress in beachwear, just for kicks I guess.  Sure it's lame, but its kind of fun, at least the folks are trying to help us have a little fun at work.  The biggest upside is that we have all these t-shirts in the window that the AE Visual team have cut up, or in AE speak, "customized."  They are really shredded..collars cut out, backs shredded, halters made from tees, the works.  But they look good on the bustforms, so every girl in the world comes in and wants to get one, except the catch is they're made from regular t-shirts.  They have to buy the 15.50 t-shirt and do any "customizing" themselves.  This scares 90 percent of women enough to tlak them out of the sale, I'm quickly learning.  So I started telling girls if they bought the shirt I would customize it any way they wanted.  SO I grabbed a pair of scissors from the cashwrap and just tarted cutting up shirts right there on the tube top display.  I am proud to say that at least three girls will be wearing Brooke Williams designs this back-to-school season. They seemed happy, which made me happy.  The management didn't even care that I was doing it, they were like "ooh, great idea!" Happy sigh...a tiny bit of creativity allowed and encouraged at a job?  That's even better than the employee discount.  So off I go to 575 Broadway once more.  Pray for me during this, yet another marathon day.  Maybe an Olson twin will come in and spice things up...after all, it IS beach party day!

      A few brief non-sequiturs and then I'm going to hit the road to dreamland.  1. Life is once again not a desperate grapple for sanity.  The internship is good, the job is good, things are improving.  please discard any and all suicide notes i may have left laying around carelessly.  They were just rough drafts anyway.  The final draft would be much much darker and more ironic.  2. Speaking of my  urlLink internship ... I got to be a fit model today...basically that means i put on the new coats from our fall line while European women and gay men (in plaid pants) grope, cup, and prod me and comment about how my chest is small.  No wonder models are so twiggy and skittish...its nerve racking being surrounded by people poking at you and barking commands at you ("Zip!" "Turn!" "Bend!" "Snap!") while openly staring at your chest.  If you buy a Spiewak jacket this fall at Urban Outfitters, and it's a small, it will fit correctly and look its best because i tested it for fashion and wearability.  You're welcome.  3. Last night I was talking to my friend Nick in California, and i was strolling along my street in Manhattan.  After standing in front of an old Volvo station wagon parked on the street, I realized that it was FILLED to the brim with bales of hay.  No tarp laid down, nothing...just like 6 bales of hay.  On the Upper East Side of Manhattan.  In June.  It was "what the crap?" and "only in New York" all rolled up into one. I wanted to climb in and then explain to the owner that i'd errantly assumed he was offering urban hayrides.  4. I decided tonight that I'm going to write and record an album this year, no matter what.  It's going to be called "Treading Holy Water" and it will be acoustic.  It might suck, but I have to start somewhere.  I'll keep you posted.  5. All skate.

      I'm sure you already have Jason Mraz's CD "Waiting For My Rocket to Come"...in all likelihood, you're listening to it right now.  Or maybe not.  Is it conceivable that you haven't yet discovered his unique song stylings, his stream-of-consciousness deliciousness?    Well you can hear his new single Curbside Prophet  urlLink here .  And then you can ask to borrow my copy of his CD until you can haul your a$$ to Target or wherever fine music is sold.  (On a less commercially released note, download "JesusJesusBoBeezus" by Mraz and friends...it's on a fan site called "Mrazmerized" or something equally silly.) Word has it that he studied musical theatre before going all jangly folk pop rock on us.  I contend that he has the best voice in Pop music today, perhaps the most versatile voice since Buckley. Just steer clear of the Mississippi, ok, JMraz?  (If that one zinged passed you, go Google "Jeff Buckley swimming" and get an education.  It's not too late to jump on the Mraz train.  I didn't even realize I was MISSING the train until Randy Surface sang "Zero Percent Interest" (not on the CD, so don't bother scanning the liner notes in tears) at his welcome-home-from-the-Francophone-lifestyle concert in 02.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go watch him sing his little hat-cocked-to-the-right heart out on the NBA finals (Star Spangled Banner style.)..ok, I'm back.  That was awesome!  Singing the SSB is hard stuff right there in front of Shaq who is four times his size, but he came through like a champ.  I'll leave you with this: one time, when I still worked in the pits of hell (aka Planet Hollywood), I found out one of the servers had taken some catered food over to TRL like they did every day, and JMraz had been there.  Devastated, we convinced our favorite chef Willie to make us a dummy plate of veggies or something so I could pretend we'd "forgotten" them, and I could sneak a peek.  Amazingly, our little scheme worked, and in we went to the MTV studios...while this was nothing out of the ordinary (we made the trip 2-3 times a week) I was startled to see a very small, cute scrumtrulescent man walking my way.  As we passed one another in the hallway, he made the appropriate "I-don't know-you-but-here-we-both-are-in-this-small-hallway" smile/polite nod combo,  I resisted the urge to whisper "these are your broccoli spears and carrot niblets!" and chose instead to return the smile, and run awkwardly into the now empty green room to discard said greens.  For the record, I ate one.  Not bad!  So that was the time I ate some of Jason Mraz's fake catered food in the MTV green room.  It's these sort of things that probably seem a wee bit pathetic in the retelling, but definitely saved the day on the boredom tip at Planet Hollywood, infusing just a little sunshine into the gloom of food service.  So thanks for the nod, Mraz....next time we hang out (which will be the first time) I'll bring the broccoli florets..I owe you one.

      ..I wish they said that phrase in more places than old episodes of "Hey Dude."  I promise to have a zany, fun-filled story for you soon...but right now very little zaniness is in my life.  I suppose that's not totally true...I DID happen upon a huge street fair on my way fromt he subway to my apartment, and there were two GIANT drag queens in the middle of the street trussed up and singing "Dead or Alive" by Bon Jovi to a warbly tape recorder accompaniment.  I think they were advertising a play...?  I guess the moral of that story is that my life probably isn't as boring as I imagine it to be on days like these.  SO here I am, back in NYC.  I'll admit I'm not 100 percent thrilled, after a WONDERFUL trip back to the OH.  I just plain feel sorry for people that have never lived in Ohio, cause it's full of rad places and people.  (And fat people, sadly...I don't think I noticed until I moved here how many people are critically overweight in the Midwest...it's probably all the delicious food.)  I started my new job at American Eagle in Soho today (575 Broadway, come on in and visit!) which will heretofor be referenced as simply "AE".  Everyone seems nice, and it was liberating to wear my own clothes to work, free from visors and aprons.  I'm sure like all part-time jobs I'll grow weary of it at some point and begin blogging viciously about the evils of AE, but for now I'm psyched to be there.  I am equally geeked about going to  urlLink church  tonight at our NEW VILLAGE LOCATION! (Read that in a game show host announcer voice.)  It will be good to see everyone again.  Plus, we're talking about the Harry Potter movie as a metaphor for the supernatural in life. I like churches that aren't afraid of Pop Culture.  I wish I had more exciting news, but right now, not working at Cold Stone is it.  I have an advance copy of the Pretty Weapons CD, and that's changing my life for the better.  Things also changing my life for the better right now: -Ryan Adams, especially his album Heartbreaker...it's very old-country influenced, and I uber-dig it. - urlLink Lime Wire .  Screw Kazaa and it's slow cumbersome search and download process.  This is much easier to locate what you want, with a much wider selection, and way more reliable files.  So far, all 20 things I've downloaded have been complete, accurate files.  Spare me the lecture on internet downloading or I'll give you one back, and mine is better. -David Gilmour.  Did anyone know that Pink Floyd's guitarist was not only awesome but BEAUTIFUL back in the day?  We watched Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii and I thought that Leonardo DiCaprio's older hotter British brother was playing guitar shirtless in the desert.  He's my Classic Rock, was-hot-but-is-now-old boyfriend. -Anthony Yankovic III.  This is a friend of Matt and Brandon's who is doing the cover art for their CD.  He also has pieces in NYlon and Complex magazine, and Nike and Time Life.  His art ROCKS (the guys have it all over their apartment, but you can view it  urlLink here .)  He's an OU alum, so maybe some of you from the A-town posse know of him.  I really want to own some of his originals at some point in life when money is available for such pursuits.  My favorite is under "paintings" and it's the one near the bottom with the man in a hot dog costume teaching his son to ride a bike.  Check out TPW's album cover on there too. -playing guitar.  Watching the guys inspired me to play more, and I've been playing every day and actually (gasp) seeing improvement! It's only a matter of time till I play out.  I refuse to be scared anymore. -Mae Klingler called me relatively out of the blue a few days ago, and it totally made my day.  She is such a rad individual...she pretty much singlehandedly made me excited about prayer again for the first time in months.  Mae, you're the rock and the roll.  What things are improving YOUR quality of life lately?  Seacrest out.  Funniest thing I heard all week: "Ok, it's the 3rd. Well,...I'm going to put the 2nd,....cause it's classier." --Brandon, writing out his late rent check to his roommate that fully well knew he was writing it on the 3rd.

      That's library for all you non-Mexi's.  I'm here again with Matt...he's doing Pretty Weapons booking stuff...I'm doing....nothing.  I checked my email, caught up on blogs, read up on Andy Roddick, and now I'm just sort of treading internet water.  I'm not complaining.  I'd rather be lazing away an afternoon with my boyfriend in CBus than slaving away at Cold Stone, serving up sugarless ice cream to middle-aged Jewish ladies who'd rather hang with their dogs than their kids.  Well, in all fairness, I'd probably rather hang with their dogs than their kids, too.  Last night was hilarious...Matt McKernan and another guy who just goes by "Stoss" came over, and they all jammed out for a little bit in the living room.  NOTE TO MEGAN: Matt started playing slide guitar, and it sounded just like Jack White, I almost called you.  Anycrap, the guys eventually left and after some chocolate chip cookie baking, we decided to turn in kind of early.  Now, Matt and I have been playing the "no, YOU take the couch, no YOU take the couch" game most nights, because whomever sleeps on the couch is going to sleep about 1.4 hours on average.  It is similar in comfort to sleeping on an angry porcupine, or a pile of chinese stars.  So because Matt's shoulder has been plaguing him, I've been glad(ish) to take the couch.  Last night, though, we went through the usual ten minute "no you no you" ending in me volunteering for the couch again.  My soul cried inside a little, but I wanted to actually act like a Christian for once, and put someone else's needs ahead of my own wants.  So as I lay there wide awake under my singular blanket(because trying to sleep only makes me half-asleep and cranky that I'm laying on a stockpile of swords disguised as a sofa) I hear Matt coming back down the stairs...he appears holding roughly 19 blankets and pillows, and a huge smile and he gleefully announces, "ok, here's what's happening.  We're moving the furniture, folding this couch out, and we're sleeping down here."  I don't THINK he was wearing shining armor, but it sure seemed that way.  So that's exactly what we did, and then settled in to sleep...except, we couldn't.  Whispering turned into talking turned into laughing turned into trying not to wake everyone up while we performed our favorite novelty rap hits of the 1980's and 90's.  (Young MC, Marky Mark, Digital Underground, they all got a nod.)   Matt ruined it by continuing to sneak GOOD hip-hop into the mix..you havne't lived until you've seen your psychedelia-and-metal loving boyfriend gleefully performing Wu-Tang's greatest hits while jumping on a pull-out couchbed.  In a word, surreal.  We tried to wake Brandon up to join in the hilarity, but he was already in the throes of sleep.  I guess it's for the best...in those stretches of 5 and six weeks where I don't see him, it's those kind of ridiculous moments when its just us that I'll remember and smile.    I always suspected that boy-girl sleepovers would be more fun, but mom never let me investigate that theorem.  I tried to have my gay friend Nick Sargent spend the night (in the basement, not even a same bed situation) in about 10th grade, and mom replied, "Brooke! That's how babies are born!" which sent both of us into fits of hysteria on the kitchen floor.  Apparantly, gay friends sleeping over two floors beneath you will knock you up, so WATCH OUT. You will not learn this in 6th grade health class, it's a conspiracy of some sort.  In conclusion to this exercise in "i think people realize i'm just killing time", I am pretty sure Matt is my lobster, but he's also a pretty damn good friend.  But he can sleep upstairs tonight. :)

      ..you know how sometimes you go to your boyfriend's roommate's girlfriend's Memorial Day bonfire, and your boyfriend's other roommate drives you all there, but then leaves early, and your purse (with all your money, ID, and phone) is in his car, and when you get a ride home later his car is locked and he's asleep, and when you get up to go to the airport, you realize he's already gone to work in Dublin which means by the time you get to Dublin and back and to the airport you'll miss your flight, so you call the airline and they tell you the other flights for the day are all overbooked and you'll have to come back Friday and your sister is nice enough to save you from having a heart attack by paying the difference, but you're still stuck in Ohio for three more days, glad you brought extra underwear?  Yeah, sigh...I'm having one of those days.  So instead of being on East 83rd, I'm on South High street, at the library with Matt and Brandon, doing PR for the Pretty Weapons.  There's nothing normal about today.  Now that the crisis is mostly resolved (ie: i know that I can go home at SOME point), I guess I'm settling down enough to be okay with it.  It's not that I wanted to be in NYC in particular today, but I do miss Roommate, and she's waiting for my paychecks, which are waiting for me.   Brandon said he was going to treat us all to seeing Return of the King for the third time to save us from our poverty-induced murder suicide pact since it is 50 cent night at the Dollar theatre.  But for right now, I guess I'm content.  It's not the "A" plan, but the last few days have sort of started to de-mummify me, and I guess a few more here might further dust the cobwebs off and make me ready to return to my abusive lover, NYC.    Good things that have happened since I've been home:  sitting on Matt's porch with the Columbus BFF's, watching it rain and listening to music.  spending time with Matt...yum.  going to the Pretty Weapons show for the first time in a year...i heart Megan and Tracy for coming.  Thrift shopping with Brandon  sitting on the porch with my sister Kim in total peace and quiet, except for the sound of our incessant gossiping about our family.  Seeing Troy for free, and eating at Cal. Pizza Kitchen with my sister Tammy and Matt, which was SO fun.  Watching the Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore ad infinitum.  Spending time with Mom and Dad as they shoved food down my throat 24-7.  Maybe my pants will finally fit.  Kate's bonfire (although a catalyst for disaster, it was probably the most fun thing I've done in a LONG time.)  She has one of the top five greatest backyards in the history of backyards...a bonfire pit, a garden, picnic table, hammock, tree swing, and lots and lots of open yard with their friendly (but prone to catching-on-fire) dog Pinecone. We just sat around under the stars and talked about important issues of the day like Burger Time, Bill Murray, and dreams where you pee your pants.  Going to 180 and OU and seeing everyone I still know there...Donkey Coffee is my Xanadu. Also College Green, the Pita Pit, and Bagel Street Deli.  All other-worldly.  Playing Hobo Scrabble (rules forthcoming in a future blog, or just ask Ben Scragg.)  My birthday..going to Strouds Run and hanging with the Athens crew...and writing/performing "Who Stole My Ass?" (Penned by Ben Scragg and myself) ...I have gone ahead and proclaimed it the Stairway to Heaven of Novelty Ass songs.  My deepest gratitude to everyone who took the time to spend time with me on that or any day here...it meant SO much.  Three words: Mountaineer Family Restaurant.  When Randy Surface drove me home,  we were talking in his car in my driveway, and i had my door open.  A frog hopped right on in and up on his dashboard.  It was possibly the loudest, scariest noise Randy has ever made..and the most hilarious.     Things I have to look forward to when I get back: seeing Roommate cashing my checks and beginning to pay off my debt no more Cold Stone starting at AE in SoHo on Sunday (thanks to Beth!) going back to my internship Megan's birthday extravaganza--July 15th (or thereabouts if she's in da OH) seeing Matt/The Pretty Weapons show on July 16th at Arlene Grocery Bryant Park Film Festival The Journey Shakespeare in the Park Central Park playing guitar in Central Park/East End Park seeing all my NYC BFF's  and lastly, a quote about poverty: "do you understand that a bottle of Dr. Pepper is like caviar to me right now?" --Matt

      ...get busy.  (remember that song?)  So...Cleveland.  I have landed myself a job with Music for America, as their new New York state coordinator.  I will fill you in on this more later, but is essentially, as far as I can tell, a 20-hour a week dream job.  I leave for my first real-live business trip tomorrow in of all places, Ohio.  Unfortunately, this involves a 6am flight, a layover in Chi-Town (Ben Scragg, here I come?) and a fair amount of melee.    I not-so-long ago wrote an email to Matt, remarking that one of my favorite times in life are those moments when all hell breaks loose.  It's always an exciting time, oft fraught with hilarity.  There are definitely times when all hell breaking loose is not so funny (eg: national disasters) but more often than not, it's a moment which merits a good wide-eyed, head-shaking, eye-wiping belly laugh, if only in retrospect (eg: the infamous creek fire.)  All hell breaking loose breaks up the monotony of the daily grind, it gets the blood pumping.  It provides endless material for stories (eg: then Justin Timberlake came in the door and all hell broke loose.) I love it.  Melee is something else entirely.  Melee is sweaty, it is uncomfortable, it is particularly exhausting.  Melee is rushing from point a to point b all day, against a tidal wave of humanity trying to get to point b to point a. It is late flights, slow cab-drivers in slower traffic, construction, rude customer service airline counter representatives.  It is trudging from one plane to another with all of one's luggage, going hundred of miles out of the way for a connecting flight, drinking an 8 ounce coke when you want a 16 once Dr. Pepper.  It is dragging luggage around, while toddlers crawl over you and do penny drops from your limbs like you're a giant anthropomorphized jungle gym provided for their exercise and enjoyment at the terminal waiting area.  Melee is the general confusion that ensues at metropolitan hubs of travel, making one feel that no matter what transpires, its going to a) be unexpected, and b)probably not be helpful or convenient to one's plans.  So, I expect travels rife with melee tomorrow, but who knows?  All hell could break loose.

      ...I will attempt to jump the Grand Canyon on this Big Wheel.  Have you ever found yourself perched&nbsp;on the precipice of some ludicrous scenario, saying to yourself, "this will almost certainly be the most ridiculous thing I've ever done,"?&nbsp; Perchaps.&nbsp; How about twice in one weekend?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; I thought not.  The first time these words passed my lips this week was Friday morning.&nbsp; Megan's co-worker Justin has a sister who interns over at Good Morning America, and long story short, had managed to get me on the VIP list for the Lionel Richie appearance at Bryant Park.&nbsp; Arrival time: 6am.&nbsp; Megan had to work at 7, so I was left to experience Lionel Mania solo.  So as I rolled out of bed at 5am, to see LIONEL RICHIE by myself, (on the VIP list no less), I turned to Megan and said, "This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done."&nbsp; To which she said, "No.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's awesome."&nbsp; So off I went, still feeling somewhat unsure of the pathetic:rad ratio, but too excited and sleep-deprived to think too much about it.  So: Lionel Mania in&nbsp;a nut shell.&nbsp; I arrive at Bryant Park.&nbsp; VIP turns out to mean that you're ushered into a special roped-off area directly in front of the stage, and the general public is probably 20 feet behind behind velvet ropes.&nbsp; (They eventually let them come up with us, but not until just before the concert.)&nbsp; The other VIP's consisted of mostly "friends of friends" like myself, but also contained a disturbing demographic.&nbsp; The Lionel Richie Fan Club.&nbsp; This was about thirty or so middle-aged women (if the term "stage mom" means anything to you, that's the most powerful imagery I can conjure up that touches their look and demeanor.) and their children.&nbsp; The LRFC had come equipped.&nbsp; Home-made T-shirts (reading simply "Lionel!"), dozens of  roses  which they threw at Lionel's feet, oversized buttons emblazoned with a charicature likeness of Mr. Richie and The Lionel Richie Online Fan Club...  sidebar: A LRFC member (presumably their leader)&nbsp;was passing out said buttons, and meandered over to me.&nbsp; I was percolating with anticipation...I could already see it on my bulletin board, right next to my official NSync fan club membership card from 2001.&nbsp; She then asks me if I'm an official LRFC member, to which I stupidly answer truthfully, "no."&nbsp;&nbsp;She then yanks the bag of buttons back from beyond my grasp, and coldly tells me the buttons are for fan club members  only .&nbsp; She then hands me literature about joining the club online for free.&nbsp; I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.&nbsp; Or stab her.&nbsp; I chose laugh, but I have a sneaking suspicion I chose poorly.&nbsp; Have you ever seen Selena?&nbsp; Well, this woman put me eerily in mind of Selena's fan club president that ends up killing Selena.&nbsp; She was just a teensy bit too demanding about getting backstage, and having Lionel repeatedly acknowledge her from the stage by essentially non-verbally bullying Lionel.&nbsp; I don't know much, but I do know this: No one, I mean NO ONE should be pushing Lionel Richie around.&nbsp; I hope he has a nice, tall electric barbed-wire fence around his house.&nbsp; Because there's a good chance she has a shrine to him in her bedroom in East Deliverance with hairs from his various afros and moustaches over the years, and the words "You will be mine forever, Lionel!" carved into the wall as "Endless Love" plays on a loop. Ick.  Ok, so yeah.&nbsp; People were carrying signs that said things like "Lionel, we have Endless Love 4 U" and "Hello, Is it Us you're Looking For?"....the girl next to me kept screaming "he's my husband!" which was really pissing off her real husband who was nice enough to get up at the buttcrack of dawn to see this concert with her.&nbsp; A cell phone rang beside me...and the ring-tone was unmistakably "Brick House." (I'm not kidding.)&nbsp; There were also fans (like Southern Baptist Church style) in the shape of Lionel's face with his image on them.&nbsp; At this point, I was pretty sure I had accidentally swallowed some Peyote or something and was extremely high.   Lionel finally emerged and played a phenOMENAL set including: Dancing on the Ceiling, Brick House, You Are The Sun, Fancy Dancer, and several Commodores tunes, ending with a heart-stopping performance of "All Night Long (All Night)."&nbsp; Ridiculous?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; I hope to add my Lionel pictures onto this blog, as soon as I remember how to do that.  So, okay.&nbsp; That was way too long...so now part B is going to have to be the postcard version.&nbsp; The second time I said "This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done" this week was when my AE amiga Maria said, "hey, I play saxophone and you play guitar.&nbsp; Let's go street perform in the subway."&nbsp; Mind you, I have never "played out" before.&nbsp; Megan has heard me play.&nbsp; Matt has heard me play.&nbsp; Ben, Sarah, and a small handful of other people have heard me play.&nbsp; But never thousands of strangers.&nbsp; I brought my guitar to our designated meeting spot, convincing myself I was only going for moral support.&nbsp; I can barely play with a pick...that's worth mentioning.&nbsp; I don't like to play with a pick.&nbsp; I'm left handed, so it just ruins my life.&nbsp; I'd much rather just finger pick all the livelong day, but apparantly "no one can hear me" according to Huge.  So we go...OHHHHH!!!!! I almost forgot.&nbsp; I get off the 6 train at Bleecker Street, and pass a cute 30-ish guy in a green polo.&nbsp; My favorite shade of green no less...so I sort of look up..and realize it is MICHAEL SHOWALTER from the State.&nbsp; He has been my sketch comedy boyfriend for the better part of a decade.&nbsp; If you're not familiar with The State, imagine running into not ONLY a cast member of your favorite show ever, but your FAVORITE cast member of said show.&nbsp; So I stop him and say, "excuse me, I have a question. You're Michael Showalter, right?" to which he replies, "yes," tentatively, the way I answer when people with no caller ID&nbsp;ask if Miss Brooke Williams is there on my cell phone and I suspect that they're a creditor.&nbsp; I say, "you are hilARious.&nbsp; I'm just a really huge fan of yours." He is in the midst of saying thank you when I realize I am bashing him in the back of the knee repeatedly with my guitar case.&nbsp; I quickly say "and now I'm hitting you with my guitar case.&nbsp; Goodbye." to which he half-smiles and says "Take care! Goodbye!" much more politely than I could have mustered were I being assaulted by a fan&nbsp;on a crowded train platform.&nbsp; I cursed my&nbsp;bout of klutziness&nbsp;for the next few minutes until&nbsp;Maria showed up, and wondered if Michael Showalter bruised easily.  Maria is very persuasive, and lo and behold, there we were, playing on the subway platform.&nbsp; At first, I was TERRIBLE.&nbsp; I kind of wondered if this was not only a bad idea, but possibly the&nbsp;worst idea ever.&nbsp; It would be like if&nbsp;John Coltrane played&nbsp;a session with a small spider monkey picking up the guitar for the first time...that's the disparity we're talking about at first.&nbsp; Then, Maria gave me the best advice ever..."they can't hear most of what you're playing anyway.&nbsp; So just play as loud as you can..just play chord progressions, and I'll play over them.&nbsp; Even if its wrong, just keep going, and play as hard as you can."&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; And lo and behold, it slowly got better and better, and suddenly I looked up as a kindly Hispanic lady was chucking a 5 dollar bill into the open guitar case.&nbsp; It was the most satisfying moment of my life.&nbsp; I'm not even joking a tiny&nbsp;bit.&nbsp; Then more people followed as the&nbsp;train traffic ebbed and flowed.&nbsp; We got hit on a lot by frat guys wanting to know if we knew any Jack&nbsp;Johnson, and saying "you rock."&nbsp; An hour and a half (and a trip to KMart&nbsp;for cheap iced tea later) we ended up with about 21 dollars to split between us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it bought me snacks and a subway pass, and YES it was much needed money, but the worth of playing out for the first time,&nbsp;including a song that I wrote&nbsp;is immeasurable.&nbsp; I lied...the actual most satisfying moment of my life came about a half hour after the first most satisfying moment, at KMart in Astor Place.&nbsp; As I went to pay my 99 cents for my huge ghetto can of Iced Tea,&nbsp;it hit me: I earned this money playing music that I wrote.&nbsp; Not selling crappy. vaguely suggestive&nbsp;graphic tees, not scooping ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to hug the cashier, but I settled for saying a&nbsp;quick silent thanks to God for being the God of the ridiculous.  "Joy&nbsp;is what happens when we reach our potential."&nbsp; --Pastor Nelson at church tonight.&nbsp;

      This is, as they say, "key."    Last week I spent a few dollars I didn't have to go to a concert I couldn't miss.  Gillian Welch and Old Crow Medicine Show at Bowery Ballroom.  I will spare you the long details and just say that I managed to get in, and OCMS took the stage.  It was hands down the best live bluegrass I've ever heard.  The singer Willie looked about my age, but sort of wobbled back and forth as he sang, eyes clinched shut, as if he were channeling some grizzled bluegrass veteran from days of yore.  The fiddler, Ketch, played so hard that his bow was essentially shredded by the third song.  This did not stop them from playing for an hour an a half solid.  This was just the opening act.  Oh, also David Rawlings sat in on their entire set.  If you don't know him, he's kind of like the Rick Rubin or P. Diddy or Pharrell Williams of alt-country.  He plays with and produces everyone, and seems to invoke a sort of awe from everyone around him, despite seeming to also only be about 30.  Then Gillian Welch (also with David Rawlings.) There are no words.  Go buy every album she's ever made.  I never want to hear anyone say there's no one making awesome music right now...this was heart-breakingly beautiful, musical, melodic, timeless music.  It made you forget you were standing in a cramped general-admission venue.  So they play an hour set, and then take a short break.  Intermission..by this time I really have to use the restroom, because the nice man behind the bar can see that I came to the show by myself, and has been slipping me me free Ginger Ale all night.  I beeline for the restroom downstairs to avoid the monstrous lines that always seem to materialize at such events.  After only a short wait, a stall opens up, and a petite brunette comes out, gives a brief, small smile and eye contact as she exits and i enter, and i close the door.  And then it hits me.  That was Norah effing Jones.  I pee faster than anyone ever has, and head out to the sinks, where she is very demurely washing her hands.  Norah Jones strikes me as someone who does everything demurely, even mundane, necessary tasks like washing one's hands. (Sidebar: GUYS, yes, washing your hands is a necessary task after using the restroom.  Please.  For our sake.)  So I resist the overwhelming temptation to say anything to her, and let her be.  I figure she's had a huge year what with the 7 grammys or whatever it was, so this is probably one of the only times she can e out in semi-public with her friends and not ten bodyguards.  So I'm still contemplating all of this, and deciding whether I should get a drink.  As I'm pondering, I notice a tall girl beside me who I STILL have not decided was Parker Posey, but very possibly could have been.  I would have figured it out, and almost certainly not been able to resist chatting her up, had the following not happened.    I keep trying to semi-discreetly peek around this guy who's talking to Maybe Parker Posey, and in my mind I'm getting sort of peeved.  After all, it's probably some random guy trying to score on Parker Posey, and she probably doesn't want to talk to him, this short, shabby hipster in a jean jacket who...wait...no...yes.  It's Ryan Adams.    I call Mae Klingler in the stairwell.  We freak out together.   I then return to my spot upstairs, right near where Norah is hanging out against the wall.  Gillian and David return, and play a few more songs...then they bring Norah up, and they all play two songs.  DELICIOUS.  Then Gillian and David play the rest of their set, at least another hour. They leave to thunderous applause.  They of course come back for an encore, and bring with them....Ryan Adams.  They do a Neil Young song, and a Whiskeytown song (all onstage were involved in Whiskeytown in some fashion)...  THEN...all hell breaks loose.  Ryan Adams, Norah Jones, Old Crow Medicine Show, Gillian and David all come onstage for a 20-minute all out howdown, that ends so fast and furious that I fear for the fiddler's life.  So, a show that began at 9:15pm ended at 12:53am.  Even with intermission, that's well over three hours of music.  In a word, scrumtrulescent. Alt-Country....yum.

      ...or at least read about it first.  I actually finished writing&nbsp;a song tonight.&nbsp; Stop the presses. It's called "Slowest Sunrise."&nbsp;  Megan has heard the rough cut, and we both agree it needs&nbsp;a cello part.&nbsp;  Any cellists out there?&nbsp; Show of hands? Don't all raise your hands at once. ... What this means, you realize, is that I am one astronomically giant step toward one of my top goals in life.&nbsp; I am no longer just a lyricist.&nbsp; From tonight on, I can say I'm a singer/songwriter, without doing those "air-quotes" with my fingers while I'm saying it. One song down, 9 to go for my destined-for-platinum debut.&nbsp; (What??? It could...ok, shut up.)  If you're havin' pitch problems, I feel bad for you, son.&nbsp; I got 99 problems, but the song ain't one.

      special "Brooke goes to an Urban Streetwear trade show for her internship and tried to tell Randy Surface over the phone what she's experiencing" edition  Randy: So what exactly IS classified as Streetwear? Brooke: Uh, like lots of big belt buckles,&nbsp;aviator sunglasses&nbsp;and hipster clothes and graffitied blazers marked up 800 percent.&nbsp; Well...let's put it this way.&nbsp; If one of the Strokes would ever conceivably wear it, it's in this room right now. Randy: I can totally picture it.&nbsp; Are the Strokes there? Brooke: possibly.&nbsp; Pretty much everyone in the room looks like they might be&nbsp;a Stroke.  Brooke: Everyone is trying to "out-hip" each other here.&nbsp; Lots of faux-hawks and tattoos and bangs.&nbsp;  Randy: So it's like if Jesse Smith (ex-Zao drummer) were there. Brooke: It's like if&nbsp;all&nbsp;of the dozens of guys&nbsp;who have&nbsp;EVER been in Zao were here, and they all exploded into hundreds of other little hipsters.&nbsp; In fact, I'm pretty sure I just passed Kevin Moran (ex-Zao member 146). I think he offered me a Red Bull.  Brooke: Sorry it's so loud...I'm at a trade show and there's a DJ spinning. Randy: yes, I was trying to figure out&nbsp;what possible scenario would&nbsp;merit&nbsp;you being&nbsp;somewhere where&nbsp;techno was blaring that loud in the middle of&nbsp;a weekday afternoon.  &nbsp;

      ...that was a great show. &nbsp; Things I've learned today: &nbsp; Megan's 1970's boyfriend is Roger Daltrey of "The Who" fame... (mine is David Gilmour of "Pink Floyd" fame.) &nbsp; It is indeed possible for me to meet, and even double&nbsp;my daily sales goal at American Eagle. Bring on the raises, folks.&nbsp; (I didn't get a raise, for the record, I was just asking if we could bring one on.) &nbsp; Matt's hair is now long enough to pull back in a ponytail without looking dumb.&nbsp; This was not the case a few months ago.&nbsp; I don't know how I feel about that.&nbsp; If Brandon's in the room, there would be a triumverate of ponytails, and I would still be the only woman.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; The huges were here, played a very Pink Floyd worthy improv prog space blues rock show that is sure to go down in the annals as, well, a disaster despite their excellent playing.&nbsp;They left five and a half hours later, fueled with nachos and vh1 classic. &nbsp; Until last night, Ravi had never met Matt.&nbsp; I remembered this around the time Matt goes, "Hey, man, I'm Matt," to Ravi.&nbsp; Worlds colliding...I forgot there were BFF's who had yet to meet the huge. &nbsp; Mobb Deep seems to consist of two non-descript looking black&nbsp;men.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I was held up TWICE today by their video shoot, in two different locations.&nbsp; Weird.) &nbsp;  urlLink What Comes Around Goes Around &nbsp;and/or Screaming Mimi's might be hiring.&nbsp; This is the greatest news I've ever heard.&nbsp; They are amazing vintage boutiques.&nbsp; You should pick up this month's Nylon magazine and check out the article about WCAGA.&nbsp; It's more or less the greatest vintage store in the WORLD.&nbsp; (Think of an entire room of mint condition Kiss tour t-shirts, cowboy boots, and walls of Wrangler jeans from the 1970's, and you're halfway there.&nbsp; Add a 250 dollar price tag to everything, set it in the middle of Soho, and there ya go.&nbsp; You can literally walk up and say...Lee, 1968, bellbottom leg opening, medium wash, no belt loops...and they'll pull out a stack of them that look brand-new.&nbsp; It's like denim paradise.)&nbsp; Screaming Mimi's is more of your traditional vintage store...definitely more affordable, but a lot of great pieces you can't find at a normal vintage store, and in much better condition. &nbsp; JT was apparantly in town on July 7th, and there was some sort of "scene" made at Megan and Brooke hotspot&nbsp;Suede between he and Cameron that prompted US Magazine to put the infamous split down the front cover.&nbsp; The&nbsp;"JT's in town" alarm that I spent good money to install&nbsp;in my apartment did not go off.&nbsp; I want my money back.&nbsp; Rumor has it he has a neckbeard.&nbsp; Hot. &nbsp; A guy came into AE today with an obviously fake moustache.&nbsp; There were no other unusual elements to his appearance....no kitschy outfit, no child molester dark sunglasses....not even a goofy smile.&nbsp; His friends looked similarly normal.&nbsp; But the moustache was too small for his face...somewhere in between Hitler and normal-sized.&nbsp; And obviously faux and glued on.&nbsp; SO after much prodding by my co-workers, I sidle up to him as he's shopping and say, "Ok, I have to know.....(pause pause pause....no smile from him or anticipation on his face to indicate that he knows exactly what i'm going to ask)...what's up with the moustache?"&nbsp; He seems confused.&nbsp; I point to it.&nbsp; He looks to his friend mystified, and his friend looks back and shrugs.&nbsp; He then pauses and says completely straight faced and seemingly slightly irked, "it's the STYLE."&nbsp; And walks away.&nbsp; Not one of them laughed or even hinted that it might be a joke.&nbsp; I wanted to stand up on my polo table and applaud, but a tiny part of me thought he might actually be serious, in which case I just wanted to start sobbing.&nbsp; I wished so badly that I had just happened to have access to a really chintzy looking fake beard like the one we used to use in 180 skits at OU, and I could have walked up wearing it; with a perfectly stoic expression, I would have tapped him on the shoulder&nbsp;said, "Are you finding everything alright?"&nbsp; Maybe that could have broken him.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a restaurant&nbsp;we saw last night&nbsp;CALLED moustache.&nbsp; I don't even know what to do with that information. &nbsp; Lindsay is a fo-sho for living with me in the OH.&nbsp; Now&nbsp;we just have to figure out when...and where...and how.&nbsp; Who, What&nbsp;and Why&nbsp;have been sufficiently&nbsp;covered, for those journalism majors keeping score at home.&nbsp; &nbsp; Salient was my word of the day: it means something that grabs the attention, or dynamic, or can be used as a noun for something that sticks out from a structure.&nbsp; e.g.: Brooke's salient personality propelled her sales figures to creepily high proportions today.&nbsp; She deserves a tremendous raise. &nbsp; OR &nbsp; "Matt's hair is very salient....in that it is larger and more voluminous&nbsp;than most Eurasian nation-states." &nbsp; The last thing I learned is that Psalm 143 is amazing, and that God might, just might be speaking to me...but it's just very very quiet.&nbsp; Has He been saying anything to anyone else lately?&nbsp; Keep me posted.&nbsp; If He's on tour, maybe I can catch Him as He passes through NYC. How much would tickets to God cost?&nbsp; (Don't make up some lame thing about how they're free like salvation or I'll punch you.&nbsp; If it costs 270 dollars to see Clapton, and He's supposedly God, how much for the real deal?&nbsp; I'm guessing at least 800 bucks, and that's just for lawn seats, even factoring in the slow economy and sluggish record industry.) &nbsp; Bed. Now. &nbsp;

      ...or at least my state of mind.  How can I apologize for not having blogged regularly this week, dear friends?  I guess I'll just say, "my bad," like my high school gym teacher Mrs. Holmes used to often say.  I never really liked or disliked Mrs. Holmes, but that phrase has become part of the Brooke Williams lexicon due in large part to her.  My elementary school gym teacher was a lesbian named Joyce Boone who looked unsettlingly similar to a red-headed Chris Kattan.  If I had known at age 7 who Chris Kattan was, I probably would have been too freaked out to get on the balance beam with her at the other end.  Joyce Boone...funny stuff.  It's been a long week, but I'm looking forward to the roommate coming back with Mama Jerse in tow, then celebrating her birthday, then seeing the long-lost Kaelyn Langer on Friday in all her fabulousness breezing in from Rochester!  Then Kaelyn, myself, Megan, and possibly every person I work with are going to go watch The Pretty Weapons, minus Corey and possibly Tony and adding Matt McKernan play, (huge, huge, and mckernan..that's what I'm calling them today.) and I can only imagine that some subsequent hanging out will occur.  Then depending on several factors, I will either be spending Saturday at Coney Island's Siren Music Festival (free--Death Cab for Cutie, Blonde Redhead, other indie rock) spending some quality time with the huges, or I'll be trapped in American Eagle wishing I was doing the aforementioned.  The only big news is that barring arguendo, I will be relocating to Columbus, Ohio.  The short list of reasons, in order go: to get out of debt.  There are lots of little secondary reasons, like being able to start recording my album, but mostly it's to get out of debt.  I now know how much it costs to live in NYC, and I could be doing that successfully if I didn't have hellacious debts accrued mostly during college.  So yeah...I'm probably coming home this fall sometime, and will be living with Lindsay Snow. As I know more, you'll know more.  I am currently planning on living there for 6-12 months and then trying to re-re-locae to NYC, but who knows what will happen in that time.  Joyce Boone could have begun her rise to totalitarian power by then, which will definitely alter my plans.  Hide the balance beams.

      ...everyone here is nuts.  (Insert hars hars hars here.)  So, yeaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Long week.  LONGGGGGGGGGGGG. I've decided to skip the synopsis and go straight for the non-sequiturs.    I'm currently very smelly.  I am smelly like a cab driver.  This is because I slept at Lindsay's last night, and all of my stuff was at Tammy's (my sister's).  Matt, myself, Brandon and Lindsay had what I like to refer to as a "dysfunctional double date" last night, and ended up watching Almost Famous in her basement and drinking beer out of plastic Ohio State cups probably left over from some sporting event.  All four of us are listed in the official team roster as "on a break," which we celebrated by hanging out all week as much as possible...strange but a great time was had by all.  I learned three main things from last night's events, other than that the four of us think "break" means "spend every second together."  Firstly, barbeque chips are apparently "white trash chips,", while regular chips are not.  Secondly, if you make Matt stand in a UDF for more than 10 minutes, he begins to have some sort of undefinable attack best described as a coronary "event."  It's like making my dad stand still for longer than ten minutes...no dice.  Matt was making comments to the UDF counter girl like "we're just going to hang out here all night if that's okay with you!"...this was prompted by lindsay's inability to decide between Smirnoff Ice and Smirnoff Cranberry.  Brandon made some sort of comment like "when I finally get to UDF, and get the spoon to my ice cream, I'm going to stab you in the throat with it," to Lindsay for a similar indiscretion, but failed to live up to this idle threat.  Matt paid for my white trash chips, Linds got the S. Ice, Brandon and I got ice cream, and life made sense again...as much as it has this week.  The final thing I learned is that the guys' reaction to discovering that "Behind the Music: Guns and Roses" is on is similar to Megan and I's reaction when we find Model Behavior on the Disney Channel.  A lot of excited high pitched screaming and positioning onseself as close as physiologically possible to the TV screen.  I also learned that Slash's heart once stopped in a hotel from a drug overdose, and they had to pump adrenaline straight into his stopped heart to start it again.  We almost lost Slash.  WAY too scary to think about.  So yeah, I ended up staying at Lindsay's, until this morning when the Huges and us went to breakfast.  This is our name for the guys, because they are both physically large and large in personality.  Also they call one another this, and we picked it up..it's a nice mix of an affectionate and demeaning nickname, and it just FITS.  I'll give you some examples.  "Did Huge call?" "What is WRONG with the two Huges?" "Huge! Pass me my white trash chips or I will throw this Smirnoff Ice in your face."  Ok, on to other things...I need to shower before Huge calls, I think we're hanging out after they get done with band stuff.  (See?  Bad at breaks.)  Actually, maybe I should stay smelly, it might effectively deter romance.    Other items of note:  It's Sarah Filipiak and her brother Ben Scragg's birthday!  They are collectively something like 49 years old.  That's almost Ravi's age. :)  It's also my parents' 41st wedding anniversary today.  Way to go...41 years and no breaks.  Maybe they have similar tastes in chips.  I'll have to remember to ask their secret.    My blog has won its first award....remember that blog I wrote about JMraz?  Well I'm on his street team, and they had some sort of promo to see who could come up with the most creative promo for him, and apparantly that won, so I get a JMraz baseball T that I've been lusting over for a year, and a CD for free.  Yay for street teams, JMraz, Elektra, free things, and baseball t's (my favorite kind!)  Yes, Megan, you may borrow it, but not sleep with it.  I got a FANTASTIC belt today by trading in some unwanted items at Rag-O-Rama, my favorite thrift store ever.  The belt features some nice Confederate flag-with-wings detailing, and a nice large red and white eagle with an American flag belt buckle.  Basically my belt is confused as to whether it wants to seceed from my pants.  I got about ninety comments about it today, none of which thankfully were "I hate them darkies too." (I'm glad everyone understood the irony of the belt.)  If anyone has access to a vinyl store, you should go in and find "brothers and sisters" by the Allman Brothers, and just open it to see the centerfold picture.  You should be wearing some sort of protective eyegear to shield you from all of the moustaches.  Ok, i think that's it.  Ohio is its usual glorious self.  I will have to blog about my 14 hours in the airport and all of the strife therafter a little later.  For now its time for a shower, some quality time with Tam, and maybe, just maybe a little Huge.  Megan, I am so jealous of your Leo encounter.  I would have coughed "the Beach sucked" and tripped him on his bike though.  I LOVE Leo, but it was THAT bad.  I miss you roommate.  See you tomorrow.  Hearts to all.

      ..i for one HATE Raymond and am sick of his corny show coming on after Friends reruns.  After 8 hours at the Eagle on the first day of summer clearance (women shoppers are crazy, one started stripping right out in the open because she didn't want to wait in line for a fitting room.) I am way, WAY too tired to do much pontificating, even the self-indulgent kind.  I have to get up in four hours, and there's still packing to be done, and things to be remembered. Right now I don't feel that I could remember my own social security number.  I think it starts with a 2.  Still, I felt I owed you all a blog since I won't be back til Wednesday.  Things I have not yet packed: My best pair of jeans my flight confirmation vitamins cd's...my carry-on bag in general. my toothbrush the magazines I'm planning on passing along to Matt the dictionary i'm also planning to pass on to Matt (he marvels at my vocabulary, little does he know I was reading the dictionary during particularly boring stints in Mrs. Hlubb's lunch detention.  I had detention every day of my eigth grade year for not doing my Earth Sciene homework.  Mrs. Hlubb gave me the creeps, and I thought her a cold and unfeeling woman, and not much in the way of a dynamic teacher either.  I was a know it all who refused to do busy work.  Let the rebellion begin.  Oh, I lied...I didn't have detention on Fridays, because looking back I think Mrs. Hlubb was human, at least in part, and needed a day where she could chain smoke with the other teachers over lunch and forget about what I smart-ass I was.  Or maybe to talk ABOUT what a smart-ass I was.  Either way, Fridays were great...but not for my vocabulary.  Here you go, Seth: Five good rock bands out right now, that aren't afraid to be a little dangerous and dirty and punk, which makes them exceptional.  (Other than the obvious, which I'll spare you.) Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Warlocks, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Velvet Revolver (I don't care if the album isn't great, effing SLASH is in it.  SLASH!!!! Slash reeeeeullllzz...and let's see, who else?  Hot Hot Heat has one good song, same with Jet...go with the White Stripes, particularly the De Stijl album.  Some say the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Icarus Line, Muse, Immortal Lee County Killers, the Von Bondies, or the Dandy Warhols, but I know not enough about them to recommend or warn against them.  I'm sure there are more, but my brain currently has the consistency of Cream of Wheat (with a little brown sugar mixed in..mmm.)  Off to the land of Apple Butter and Buckeyes (the nut, the confection, and the mascot)...pray for me.  I supposedly have to endure a credit check at the rental counter tomorrow.  I feel I have about the odds of Randy Surface on finals day, when he'd go, "what the hell?" and take his German final, even though he stopped going in the fourth week.   Pray.  Tomorrow. Ohio. Roadtrip? Open spaces. Fresh air. Friends. Matt. Fireworks. :) Porch couch...and then the return of my arch nemisis, the couch stuffed with chineses stars.  Again, pray.  See you on the flipside. Good hustle out there.
