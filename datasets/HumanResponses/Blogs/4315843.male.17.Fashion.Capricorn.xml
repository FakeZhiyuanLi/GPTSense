      LETTTING GO........ "Letting go of someone doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop loving, it only means that you allow that person to find his/her own happiness without expecting him/her to come back. Letting go is not just setting the other person (in the real sense of it), but it is also setting yourself from all animosity, revulsion, and resentment that was long kept in your heart. You have to let go because the bitterness often puts away the strengths and weakens the littlest hope, making our lives more miserable than ever. Worst, presenting yourself as the"most affected one" sets the nastiest impression of all time-- whatta a loser! The trick there is...always remember that if you lose someone today, it means that someone better is coming tomorrow. You really don't have to forget someone you ('cause it's hard). What we need to learn is how to accept the verdict of reality without being bitter or sorry for what we have become. I think it's better that we give off that dedication and to someone more "deserving." I always remember what Alfred Tennyson said .... "IT IS BETTER TO HAVE LOVED AND LOSE THAN NEVER TO HAVE LOVED AT ALL!"

      ive been doin` a lot of lookin in the  mirror and soul searching these past  few days only to see...nothing. well  nothin different than what i give you  on the surface combined with whats just  underneath the skin. i feel for you who  are scared to show what you got inside,  and even more for you who purposely  hide your shadiness deep inside. bring  your inside and outside to a consensus.  let everyone (especially the ppl you  care about) see you from day one, even  if you dont think they will like what  they see. being rejected for being real  and spittin yourself will never be as  bad as seeing the disappointment on the  face of someone you love after they  realize you were only an illusion.....

      im a strong believer of the power of change. One is susceptible to changing for the better. Though problems are an inevitable part of life, i wouldn't wanna have them if possible basing from traumatic experiences. hehehe! Therefore i keep away from them as much as i could. Happy people rock! Dull people suck! In this world, 90 percent is what you make of your life, therefore, make every second count. Past is past. slow is slow. Learn from your past, but don't dwell on it. To be happy in life, do not forget your childish curiosity...one of the best message i heard. Don't be scared to bring out the child within sometimes. It won't hurt you a bit. Smile and be optimistic. This world needs all the optimism it can get. Make friends as many as you can. Friends are like sugar and spices to life and everything nice. to wrap this up, i'm a lover of life. I embrace it as much as i cud. I may have done things that are not quite permissible in this world, but what the heck!! it was a great life changing experience which brought out the best in me.... peace out y'allâ€¦ \m/
