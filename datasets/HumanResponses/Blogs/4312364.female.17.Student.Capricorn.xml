        Hey look at this, I'm back...2 days in a row, not bad. Well not much to report...I did succeed staying up until 1, Nate and Jennifer finally got on at about 11, and then Double A (Aaron Henley) finallllly answered my message. So I was chatting it up with them til about 12:30. Went to bed and woke myself up at about 7:30, came out to the living room and fell asleep in the chair. Haha, does that count for waking up early? Anyways...The last official day of the summer, tomorrow's back to school (ugh). I'm gonna try to write in this thing everyday, but I don't know how that will go (between work and school who has time? haha). But I  will  try to get on tomorrow night after school and work to let you know how the first day went! I'm gonna try to make this last day fun, Carli comin over at 2 and we're going shopping one last time...I have to get a new purse for school! haha...  Anyways, here's my schedule for 1st semester of school for anyone who cares... A1 A2-Chemistry (Mr. Weber) B1-Child Care (Mrs. Kaylor) B2-Study Hall (Mrs. Kaylor) C1-Personal Finance (Mrs. Stitzlein) C2-Art 3 (Mr. Meek) D1-Horticulture (Big K!!!) D2-Design of Outdoors (Mrs. Carnegie) don't ask.... So there ya have it, the exciting 1st semester, which is basically a bunch of filler classes, except Chemistry cuz I still need a 1/2 credit for science...  Well now I'm sad to say I must go, gotta clean my room and do other various exciting (HA) activities before I venture to Mansfield to spend what little money I have left...

       So I decided to start a new blog. I already have a xanga, but everyone has that address and its more for entertainment, not for personal things. So I started this one so noone will know, only the people I want to know my deepest, darkest thoughts haha. Which is only like 3 people. Annnnwaaaays...so tonight is officially the last night of the summer for staying up late, so I'm planning on staying up until at least 1, which I doubt will happen cuz I am bored out of my mind...There is noone on!!!!!!!!!! But I HAVE to make myself wake up early, and I do mean early! We're talking 6, 6:30 am, cuz I have to be able to make myself go to bed early tomorrow night. And then I have to begin my senior year of highschool on Tuesday! YIPEE!!! No, not really...ugh I'm dreading it. 1: I do not want to go back to school! (what happened to the summer anyways??) 2: I am absolutely, positively not ready to graduate! (what do I do next???). I have no idea which college I am going to go to, or what I want to go to college for! HELP!!! Sure I have a couple of ideas (Cleveland State, NCSC, OSU) but I'm not positively sure. So I am going to make this last year of school memorable...haha, yeaaaahh riiight...I say that every year! And I ALWAYS end up hating the whole freaking year. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll have a boyfriend this year HAHA :/ I do have a lot more confidence and am more outgoing than I used to be...I dunno, we shall see what happens...Anyways, lets discuss what I did today...NOTHING! haha, well I did make myself wake up at 7! So I'm kinda tired right now...I stumbled out to the kitchen and saw that my mom was making eggs, ugh I can not eat anymore eggs, I'm sooo sick of them!!!! So I poured myself a bowl of Corn Pops (mmm mmm) and collapsed on the chair to gobble them down. Then of course I had to feed my kitties (so cute). After that I decided I was too tired to function properly so I laid back down on my bed to snooze for a little bit more...Plus I was freezing!!! When I heard my dad leave, I went out to watch Godsend w/ my mom (that is one fuhreaky movie!) After the movie ended, I hopped in the shower to begin my getting for work ritual. 2 hours later (haha) I went to work. Well that was soooo much exciting, I pretty much did nothing alllll night...and let me tell you, that was loooads of fun. Got home at 9, ate some ice cream annnndd....Tada! Here I am! Typing my fingers off! Well, I think this was a successful first post, I do have  some  experience (hehe). Hope you (whoever you refers to ??) enjoyed...
