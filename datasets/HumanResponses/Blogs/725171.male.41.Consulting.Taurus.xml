       urlLink Yahoo! News - Iraqis Have Doubts Over Choice of Interim Premier : "Many Iraqis often complain they have never seen a member of the Governing Council walking the streets or shaking people's hands. Security concerns mean there is little opportunity for such contact with ordinary Iraqis. "   So the guys currently "running" Iraq, who will help "hand over" "sovereignty" to a "free Iraq" in a month, are doing such a poor job that they cannot go out in the street and meet the people they are supposedly governing. This kind of "governing" sounds like the Duvaliers in Haiti. Once the use of force and terror stops keeping the oppressed at bay, these "governors" may have to seek asylum somewhere. To me, the Bush Administration is setting up Iraq in its own image: tending to the political and economic needs of the rich while caring little for the masses. This approach is killing Americans in Iraq every day; will it also sow the seeds of its own destruction here in November?

       urlLink TomDispatch   Tom's usual excellent work is raising a couple of questions for me this afternoon.  1. When some suggest we need to 'stay the course' in Iraq, what is the 'course?' Win the war? Thought we'd done that. Bring democracy to Iraq? What does that look like? Can Iraq be a democratic nation when we are building 14 permanent bases there? Can they really be their own nation? Is that what the US really wants? Isn't anyone interested in challenging the Bush Administration into asking for a little more detail on what a 'totally sovereign' Iraq looks like?  2. Is it just me, or is the military in a huge hurry to court-martial the supposedly 'bad apple' seven soldiers caught in the prison so they can get this issue off the front page? These pictures have been out for about two weeks, and they have already convicted the first private? Maybe I'm just used to the slow-moving civilian court system, but it sure feels like this has moved from (again) 'shock' from the military that this was going on, to nailing the first criminal. Are they hoping that putting these lowest-ranking culprits in the brig will satisfy us enough that we'll forget that knowledge of prison abuse was laid on Rumsfeld's desk months ago? Are these guys taking the fall while Rummy runs free?

      Here's another Yahoo!/Reuters gem from this morning.   urlLink Yahoo! News - U.S. Troops Raid Chalabi's Headquarters in Iraq :  While testifying to Congress yesterday about the decision to stop funding well-known (unless you're the Bush Administration--oops, until recently) crook Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said, "There's been some very valuable intelligence that's been gathered through that process that's been very valuable for our forces. But we will seek to obtain that in the future through normal intelligence channels."  The next line of the story says, "U.S. officials have said they had doubts about the intelligence the INC provided and about whether Chalabi was motivated chiefly by a desire for power."  So there are doubts about the quality of the INC's intelligence, but Wolfowitz said it was "very valuable."  This makes the Administration look like that cop in  Casablanca , shocked to learn that Chalabi might not be a credible source of information. Why are these guys always the last to know?

      I read this on  urlLink Yahoo! News  this morning.  "President Bush said an interim Iraqi president, prime minister and other top ministers should be selected in the next two weeks. He plans to lay out a detailed plan this week for the handover he called 'full transfer of sovereignty.'  Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a close ally under pressure at home to withdraw his troops, came seeking assurances from Bush that Iraqis would take over their own affairs. U.S. officials said security forces would remain under U.S. command."  I'm reading over the last sentence of each paragraph. How exactly does a country have "full sovereignty" when the security forces within its borders are under the control of another country?

       urlLink TomDispatch   Tom's work (and here, that of Robert Manoff) reminds me of Reagan's deepest influence in America today. In taking our minds off Vietnam and Watergate, and making it "morning in America again," Reagan built the bubble of unreality in which not just Bush 43 but millions of us now live in America. I think we see the world as we want it to be, rather than it is--usually how conservatives dismiss liberal ideas, but now how conservatives do their business--because we could not take the pain. America's role in the world--preserving democracy, spreading the virtues of capitalism and individual rights--the world that Reagan saw as a WWII propagandist--was wilting by 1980, weighed down by a questionable war, economic stagnation, political corruption. Our national identity was being found fraudulent.  Then came Reagan, reminding us of those glorious New Deal and Marshall Plan days, and we got to forget. Unable to defeat a peasant nation in Asia, we challenged the Soviets to outspend us on nukes. Wounded from Congress' checking the president's power, we yearned to see the White House glitter again. Damn if it didn't feel great to be in America again.  Now we live with the consequences of those painkillers. Now the world hates us, and we refuse to see it. Now we are more addicted to oil than ever, but we have done nothing to get off the black junk. Now we erode personal liberty, and we say we feel safer. Reagan's morning has morphed into Bush's Bubble, in which we are the lone cowboy of justice, there's no such thing as taxes too low or income too high, and we are the defenders of good from a world of uncivilized evil. It might feel good inside that bubble, but it's sealed pretty tight and we're running out of air.

      In November 1980 I was five months shy of 18, so I missed getting to vote against Ronald Reagan. In 1984 I was an idealistic college student, reading  urlLink  The Nation   and sure that Reagan was not only intellectually incompetent to be president, but overseeing an administration that was subverting the public interest in the name of conservative causes and the self-interests of the rich and powerful. It was easy for me to vote against Reagan, and I was aghast that a guy who looked to be acting president rather than serving as president was re-elected so easily.  Reagan's death last weekend has left me with two reactions. First, listening to politicians fall over themselves praising The Great Communicator, I realize just how far Richard Nixon had fallen from grace. I don't recall his death getting nearly as much hushed respect. Of course, Nixon reminded us of Vietnam and Watergate, hardly the stuff of national mythbuilding, while Reagan's terms recall defeating a real adversary (at least in the national consciousness) and litanies of sentimental evocations of America's greatness and values. Nixon = national institutions faltering; Reagan = eagles soaring over purple waves of grain. I was pretty young when LBJ, Truman, and Ike died, so I didn't understand the level of our embarassment over Nixon until now, when I can compare Tricky Dick's death to that of the Gipper. No post offices closed when Nixon died.  My other reaction is two-sided: either Reagan makes me see just how incompetent, mean, and dangerous GW Bush is, or Bush 43 makes Reagan look pretty mild in his convictions. If I were Bush, I wouldn't be basking too closely in that reflected glow. It highlights the darker features.
