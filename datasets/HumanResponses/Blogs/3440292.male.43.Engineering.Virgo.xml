      My son comes home from school yesterday and tells me he had to go to the school nurse. When I asked him why he said he was stabbed in the back by accident. When I asked who did it he said its no big deal it was an accident. Now 6th grade boys can be very active and I let it go at that but deep in the back of my head I knew there was more to it and I wanted the truth. My wife was surfing the Web with my son and showing him where he was going for his class trip and he decided to make some wooden swords, shields and all. He tried to get my oldest son to go out to the garage and build them but my oldest was more interested in watching Spongebob. Now I was watching the news and playing with my 9 month old daughter when the barrage of “Dad can you help me”,  “Dad can show me how to …”, “Dad can you ….”, “Dad….” Arrrrrg! My wife, bless her hart just looks at me and says “why don’t you just answer him”. “I was waiting for him to breath so I could”. Some how my son has the estrogen genetics that allows him to talk without breathing.  When we get out in the garage and we are working I ask him.  Me: “so who stabbed you in the back?”  Son: “Bradley. I don’t want to be his friend anymore.”  Me: “Is this the Bradley you said had in school suspension?”  Son: “Yes, four times in the last two weeks. He is the one that pushed Greg into the tree and Greg had to get 8 stitches in his head. He also threw the battery at Greg the other day.”  Nice kid he must have a great set of parents. I wonder if they are still together.   Me: “Do me a favor” “yeah” Me: “Don’t hang with him and if you see him doing what you know is wrong tell a teacher.”  Son: “I don’t want to play with him anymore he is not my friend.”  Me: “That’s ok you do what you think is right but still protect the kids around you by telling a teacher when he does something stupid.”  Me: “As a matter of fact if there are no teachers around to tell then use your Taekwon-Do and protect the other kids. In other words kick his ass if he goes to hurt anyone.”  Ok so I gave him permission to kick someone’s ass but as long as he is sticking up for the person being bullied then I will be proud of him. If he starts a fight for a stupid reason then he will have to make up for that. I am not sure how but he will have to be accountable for his actions.

      I have a wedding to go to in a couple of weeks and I decided last night to go out and get a new suit. There is a commercial on TV by a company called  urlLink men's wearhouse  and I decided they had a couple of weeks to make me look good. I would think that’s a challenge but my wife and her friends all think I am hansom so I will just accept their taste for now.  Now when I get to their store I get two sales people trying to fight for my attention. I settle for the English speaking 24-year-old stud and not the 30-year-old Hispanic. I am not prejudice at all I just didn’t want to have to intemperate and pick out a suit at the same time.   I was quickly measured and then quickly walked over to a rack of suits. 20 min latter I had picked out my color and size and was walked over to a fitting room while my wife stood outside and chatted (flirted) with the sales person. When I walked out a tailor quickly marked and arranged the pants (that could have fitted two of me). The sales person kept telling me that my chest being so big the pants that go with the jacket would need lots of work because they don’t expect a guy with my size chest to have such a small waist.   Now I realize he was complementing me but why? His eyes where on my wife’s chest but I am sure his mind was on my wallet. After I was back in my clothes and the suit was taken to a table in the center of the room where they also sold shirts and ties, I was walked over to a table where two young girls had picked out shirts and ties that would go well with my suit. Ahhh finally the switch and my wallet may be under attack. My wife and I looked at each other and we knew what was up. Ok, we went along with them besides after you pay $349.99 for a suit what would the harm be in a $20 shirt and a $16 tie right? Well when realized their shirts cost $45 and their ties are $40, I freaked. Slowly backed away from the table and simply stated all I want is the suit I have shirts and ties thank you. My wife and I quickly paid and left the store.

      Medicare is now an official dirty word. As in fucking Medicare. I write software for a very large corporation.  So I can’t say too much about this subject but if my parents where on Medicare I would do my best to get them covered by my health plan. I see the claims that can and will get generated and I am amazed at what they will and will not cover.   I am new at this blogging thing so stick with me hopefully I wont need to use nude images to get readers. We all know sex sells.

      Ok I am not a bible thumper and by no means am I innocent. There may be no bigger sinner than I alive but I know most of my faults and I am working on them, more on that latter.  I woke up at 3:40 am and could not get back to sleep until I started to pray. For the last year I have woken up between 3 – 4 am and could not get back to sleep unless I prayed the Lords prayer. This seamed odd to me at first and praying just seamed to be the thing to do at the time but as I talked to my sisters and brothers and they opened my eyes to what was happening.   It was 3pm when our Lord was crucified and it is 3am when black masses are held. I came to realize that I became a soldier in the Lord’s army and was helping fight evil by praying. After that realization I would say my prayers and quickly fall back to sleep. At times I would start to fall off to sleep before the prayer was complete and fight to stay awake just ensure it was completed.  Today it’s cloudy and chance of rain. I like most of the humans around this office I work in feel like we should have stayed in bed and skipped work. Ahhhh High school skip day. J sex, drugs and rock –n- roll. Man that takes me back.

      I take taekwon-do three times a week, two hours a day for the last 5 years. I come home in pain at the end of each class. In the morning I walk around like I have played in the NFL my whole life. The funny part is I don’t want to quit. Male ego or what ever I just can’t stop. It all started when my oldest child didn’t want to take soccer anymore (I also coached that). He was given a choice of basketball, baseball, martial arts, or anything that involved exorcise. I wanted to ensure he would not become couch potatoes. He chose taekwon-do and I promised I would take it with him for about a quarter of a year. Well I got hooked. What ever you do don’t promise your kids anything you can’t handle. This art had better get less painful. I should have made him take up photography.

      I go online each day and checkout what’s new on the Web. More and more I am amazed at the number of people that are connecting to this world of 99% porn and 1% truth. I fall into the porn side. I would be a stereotypical guy that Luvs to look at porn. This is where all my turmoil comes from. I also love my God and want to please him but I always fail when it comes to sex and porn. It does not help that my wife is the same way I am. She may not look for porn on the Web but she does like to show off what she was given. What am I to do? I need to control myself.

      I have been in training for two day. Well one and a half but my mind was elsewhere. Every chance I got I checked my mail to see if my sweet honey bear had dropped me a line. I know she is busy with her boss but she finds the time to pop in get me going and drop out of site. Tease.. but I like that about her… Oh yea she took me shopping and I can safely say she hit my taste perfectly. I am so happy she is mine. Oh wait training is what I started talking about. Yea… It sucked!

      I have been swimming allot lately. Taekwon-Do starts up next Monday after a week off and I can’t wait to get back to class. I need a way to work off my daytime frustrations. My brain has been swimming too much. I need to discipline it back into shape. Not that I want to lose any of the last weeks I just need to keep things real. The problem is its all to real.

      My son graduated from 8th grade. It was a great time. I yelled his name at the top of my lungs and I was proud to hear that I was not the only one in the crowd that cheered him on. We got back home and we had a make your own Sunday night. We gave him a CD player he wanted and he was set for the night. It was hot and humid. It was a nasty night when it came to the weather. All of us jumped into the pool but my little girl who was already in bed. My wife sat on the ladder and watched her men swim. Her long sexy legs dangling off the ladder and into the water as we swam. She had her suit on but like most women didn’t want to get their hair wet if they didn’t have to. We stayed in the pool as long as we could. 9pm came around and since my youngest had school in the Am I shagged their butts out and they went off to bed. My wife had gone in to make sure all wet things got back out on the deck. Kids have no idea about water damage. My mind turned to other things. I was floating on my back looking at the night stars and thinking where was she! Had she done the task I assigned? What does she look like? Does this s guy have any clue? What would my wife do if she read my blog? How pissed would she be? I never told my honey bear about how my wife and I got to where we are now and why she could have fun but I can’t. Yea it’s not fair some times but it does not happen that often. My head was swimming and so was I. LOL ok, well what ever happens, happens and I am ready. She keeps asking will I? I keep telling her I will. How could I not. She seams a perfect match in so many ways. No baggage and no commitments. Open honest caring and she wants to be so daring.   The stars where out, it was dark, no one around, the trunks came off! I know my honey bear would like this. I thought of her on the ladder. I could swim up to her and do anything I wanted. The water was fine.

      I am busy all day today with work and meetings. I didn’t get to watch any fun over the weekend but I did do one suggestion a friend made I came all over my wife’s tits and I didn’t let her wash before she went out shopping on Saturday.  I can't stop thinking of a very special lady!

      Let see. I am so busy this weekend. There is the Saturday with my wife that will be 100% about my satisfaction and me. Yea I know but her satisfaction is my satisfaction so it’s really about her but please let a guy have that male ego thing ok. Sunday it’s off to my brothers for the day/night. It just happens that there is no TKD next week so I am free every night. I will need to workout so I should really go to the gym and not sit around and get fat. I have found a tease on here and she is peaking my interest. It’s a shame works so much time in my day. If she had AIM I bet she would get nothing done.

      Which reminds me there is so much to be said about Cumming in a girl and after pulling out diving in and licking her over the edge. I have done this and I can testify that I have yet to see a chick that will not arch her back and raise her ass off the bed at least 3 inches trying to dig her pussy into your face.

      After my trip to the scouts my son washed off the bug juice jumped into bed. I went out to the pool for a dip. The AC was on in the house but something about the night and the 80deg water was calling my name. I stripped at the edge of my pool and dove in. Its an odd feeling to have the water run past your cock as you swim naked but it’s a good odd feeling. My wife came out and sat next to the pool as I swam about. For some strange reason girls think swimming in a pool is a reason to take a shower where as guys think of swimming as a shower. I entertained her by swimming on my back as watched my cock. She just smiles and tells me how much she loves me and thinks I act like a little kid some time. My response was “you want it don’t you”. She smiled and I knew I was right. She made her way back into the house and was getting ready for bed and I took a couple more laps before I got out and dried off. I am not the biggest fish in the pond but I can make most of the guys I see wish they where me in more ways than one. After a cool swim there is shrinkage right? Well no, not if you towel off and then look in the bedroom window and watch your wife strip ever slowly and get into bed. She examines her body and she takes off her close looking for marks and just looks so sexy as she does this. I am sure she has no clue what she does to me. Like I said no shrinkage, just down right 100% hard manhood. The mother load to any blood-sucking bug in the yard.

      I have found about the best product available for keeping bugs off during the summer. Its called Ultrathon and is made by 3M. Its 32% Deet which is not much more than OFF but works A hell of allot better. It slowly releases the Deet over 8 hours. On me OFF only works for about 1 hour or until I get wet. I went to TKD last night and left early to take my kid to a scout meeting that was being held in a park. Campfire, songs, badges being handed out, and digital cameras clicking away what a great night to feed the local insects. I used this stuff on my legs and arms and didn’t get bothered once. Everyone else looked like they where trying to land planes on a carrier deck. I offered it to everyone and no one trusted it. Oh well all I can say is the local bug population eat good last night.

      I spent last night getting the yard ready for this summer. Which according to the temp is here. When my sons and I finished in the yard it was 84deg in my house. No AC because the humidity was low but still it was hot. My kids where all in there beds and I was stretched out on my bed watching the 11pm news enjoying the ceiling fan blowing on my bare skin. My wife came in from just taking a shower and slipped off her robe and smiled at me. I smiled back and watched as she combed her hair. She asked if she had done a good job of shaving and she walked over to show me her pussy. I ran my tong over her clit and looked up as she squeezed her tits together. She had shaved very well I didn’t notice and stubble. I asked her why she shaved so close thinking there was some hidden reason. She said she knew that after the wedding she would have to make up the time away from me somehow. She walked over to her dresser and pulled out her favorite toy and slid into the bed next to me. She told me she knows how much I love to have her cool me off so she knelt next to me and lowered her head onto my cock. I had her rest her head on my chest and I slowly fucked her mouth as she worked her toy on herself. Nasty hot summer nights are back.

      I came home from work and my wife was already home from the office and making dinner so my sons and I could get out to our Taekwon-Do (TKD) class early. We do this three times a week 52 weeks a year and yes it can seam that it sucks but once you get to class it goes by quick. Last night I asked a senior belt to show me my next pattern. In the middle of this pattern she was showing me there is a 360 deg jump and it’s nasty! You have to jump straight up spin 360 deg and come down in a different hand position than you started. Fine for a kid but for an adult it’s not easy. I did it but not until after half an hour of trying. When I started TKD years ago I could hardly get my leg up past my waist but now I can do a split and kick way over my head but still jumping and spinning has me by the balls.

      My neighbor is such an ass. The other day my son was taking out the garbage and she came out on her deck just to yell at him. She was pissed that raccoons are getting into my cans and tipping them over. He told her he can’t help that and she insisted he do a better job of closing the cans then went back inside. When he came in the house he told me what she did and I got pissed. This chick has no frigen clue. We live next to a very heavily wooded area filled with animals and I am supposed to have some magic garbage can that keeps out raccoons. Every time they knock them over we clean up the mess so I could not figure out what she was pissed about. My wife goes jogging in the AM and then to a local gym after and sometimes her husband will at the gym when she gets there. Between you and me I think the guy joined the gym because my wife goes there and he likes looking at her tits as she runs in her spandex top. They are firm for her age and tend to bounce just right. Anyway he told my wife that the raccoons are getting into his wife’s bird feeders and pissing her off. Well then she is the one that is feeding the raccoons not me. I should let my wife lose on her husband and see how much she likes that.

      I finally got my pool open last week and while the water temp is still cold at least it looks clean.   My wife went to a wedding on Saturday with her sister. Her cousin got married in Pennsylvania and they drove down together. When you have kids and you get invited to a wedding it gets difficult when no children are invited. I thought I was going to the wedding but I ended up staying home and to watch the children. Since the wedding was in PA it didn’t make sense not to get a hotel room for the night. I don’t care about missing the wedding but I do hate missing the drunken hotel sex that always follows a night of drinking with her. She told me all about it but its not the same as being there and watching. In case you are wondering they where at two different hotels. I did get promised that this Saturday she would make it up to me.

      An Irish priest is in a church on Saturday afternoon, hearing confessions...A man walks in and kneels down and begins his confession -Father, it has been two weeks since my last confession. These are my sins: Last night I had sex with Nookie Green.  That is your sin?  Yes, Father.  You are forgiven. Go out and say one "Our Father." The man leaves. Soon, another enters and kneels. Father, it has been one month since my last confession. These are my sins: I have had sex with Nookie Green every week for the last month.  The priest thinks to himself this Nookie Green woman is fairly popular with his male parishioners...  Those are your sins?  Yes, Father.  You are forgiven. Go out and say three "Hail Marys." The man leaves.  Soon, another enters and kneels down. Father, it has been six months since my last confession. These are my sins: I have had sex with Nookie Green twice a week for the last six months.  This time, the priest has to ask - Who is this Nookie Green?  Just a woman I know, Father.  Very well - you are forgiven. Go out and say ten "Hail Marys."  The priest closes the church for the evening and leaves wondering who this Nookie Green woman is...  The next morning, the priest is up in front of his congregation saying mass. The doors fly open in the back of the church and in walks this woman, a tall redhead with long gorgeous hair, a green sequin dress, green sequined heels and a green hat with a long green feather coming from it. She walks straight up the aisle and sits down right in front of the priest, her knees apart.  The priest cannot help but stop and stare. He finally catches himself and leans over to ask the altar boy - Pssssst. Is that Nookie Green?  The altar boy has a look and says, "No, Father, I think it's just the reflection off her shoes."

      My wife and I got away last weekend to Las Vegas for a long weekend. 4 day with no kids and no worries. Now when this happens why do people check their inhibitions at the airport? Don’t get me wrong, I am not complaining but its not every weekend you watch your wife stroke off a guy in the hot tub of the hotel. Not to mention get really freaky later on that night. My only question is why do you have to go all the way out to LV or some Caribbean island to let go your inhibitions? What’s with you ladies?
