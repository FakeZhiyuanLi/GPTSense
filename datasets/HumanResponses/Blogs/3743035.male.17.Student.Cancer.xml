      so its june 24 and today is the first time ive ever gotten a blog. so today i went to jims house and bill nate and jerimiah went as well. after jims house nate and jeremiah left then the rest of us went to ross music. man im kinda pissed off at tim because he wants to get a bass and amp which is fine but the bass is a bc rich beast which costs about $5-600. well anyways only four days til my birthday. well me and my friends r going to hooters in a little bit that should be fun.  man im such a loser, i really need a girlfriend. to tell u the truth im a little desperate rite now for a girl. i was supposed to go out with laura tonite but i couldnt because her sister had to go and bust her face open. man i cant wait for monday when i start working for one reason, im working with this really hot girl named sheryl (i think thats how u spell it i dont know im just stupid)man is she hot. well its 7:05 rite now and im my cousins house kinda board thats y i decided to create this stupid blog. o yeah i dont know y im writing this but i thought maybe u would like to know that im listening to some reel big fish rite now (my favorite band at this point may i add) wow y do i have friends im kinda wierd in my own opinion.

      hey everybody im here at erins like always cause i have no life. well im not pissed off any more about last nite im now a little freaked out tho. i guess on the way there or back to jeremys house i dont remember there was a pretty bad accident on the highway. and the thing that freaked me out about that was maurice had to take the van back cause she didnt trust it on the highway so she came back and grabbed the truck which i tried to hide in the bed of it so i could go for the ride. but think if maurice just took the van instaed of coming back the we could of been in that accident. or it could of happened in the truck while i was riding in the back of the bed. so i guess everything does happen for a reason. well signing off for now talk to u again soon bye.

      i hate kids so fricken much today especially when they hit you without a fuckin reason. yeah like today i was at work down back while the kids played some dodgeball and when i had them line up this one girl took a wiffle ball bat and pretended to hit me at first then for no apparent reason she hit me across the chest with the bat. so yeah that really put me in a shitty mood after work. well thats all for now talk to you later. bye
