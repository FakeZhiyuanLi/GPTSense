						    Yesterday, President Bush came to Phoenix to speak to his supporters.  My friend made 75 phone calls at the Bush/Cheney headquarters, so she got 4 VIP tickets. She invited me and my son to see George W. Bush and other speakers.  We were thrilled!

						     "The Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways.     He has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to      strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. He has given to our country      a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world.      So we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly-to see the      way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men—     to the achievement of His will to peace on earth."             --Franklin D. Roosevelt      Remember our troops in prayer today as they battle the enemy all around them. Ask God to lift them up high upon the Rock and protect them with His mighty Right Hand.      ********************************************************************   From  urlLink  Drudge:       U.S. forces say they have killed 360 Sadr loyalists so far in Najaf. Sadr's spokesmen say far fewer have died in what is the second rebellion by the militia in four months.  So, we'll have to rely on what our soldier and Iraqi bloggers say about the battle to know the truth.........as usual.  ***********************************************************************************  John Kerry: Flip-Flopper of all time!         urlLink  George F.

"So far, his aides and advisers concede, he has failed to get his message across, as Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have mocked his efforts as "a new nuance" that amount to more examples of the senator's waffling."  **********************************************************************************   Iraqi Soldiers are doing  urlLink  their job  , insensitively........must make John Kerry angry!         "BAGHDAD - Joint Iraqi Police Service, Iraqi National Guard, and U.S. Special Forces operations in Al Kut, Aug. 11, against Mehdi Militiamen may have broken the back of anti-Iraqi forces in the city, according to the city's governor,The actions came after Iraqi police stations and other government buildings were attacked and overrun in some cases.      The fighting culminated in one area when Iraqi guardsmen and police launched an assault across the Tigris River in a small boat under machinegun fire and retook a key bridge in the city.

From a 37 yr.old with Parkinson's disease:  (PRWEB) August 1, 2004 -- "Everyday I read articles and watch newscasts pertaining to President Bush and his "non-support" of stem cells, these are very misleading. There is no total restriction on stem cell research in the United States. The restrictions imposed are for "embryonic stem cell research" only and the policy only restricts utilizing federal funds (our tax dollars) for embryonic stem cell research. Adult stem cell research is open to federal funding , along with some embyronic, and scientists are free to use private funding to pursue embryonic research and have been doing so with great success as seen by the number of Universities opening up research laboratories..

						   "Yes, Saddam Hussein was a horrible man, evil, terrible man and it is a good thing we got rid of him, but......"  -Typical Liberal diatribe regarding the War in Iraq.    I am currently reading a book about   urlLink  The Rape of Nanking,    by Iris Chang.  In 1937, the Japanese invaded and conquered China at Shanghai. From there, they made their way to Nanking....slaughtering hundres of thousands of people along the way. Those that were not slaughtered were enslaved. Thousands of women were taken as "comfort women" or sex slaves. They were used as slaves to possible thousands of Japanese soldiers over and over again.  There were reports of cannibalism because the Japanese ran out of food supplies for its military. The men resorted to eating the dead Chinese.  These horrific tales were not written or spoken about for many years. The Rape of Nanking is not mentioned in many history books or memoirs of World War II.  I ask: Why?  Last week, on the Rush Limbaugh show, a caller stated that we Americans should pause and reflect on the 59th anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He implied that we, America, should feel sad and guilty for what happened on those days.  In a recent post on this blog, I wrote about the Bataan Death March survivors and what they experienced. What I did not write was what event in history freed them from their captors: the Japanese.  The boming of Hiroshim and Nagasaki ended the war with Japan and freed the thousands of American POWs in Japan. Many survivors said that had those bombs not landed, they probably had only days left to survive. They were more than happy for the bombings.  It is reported that 170,000 people were killed on Aug 6 and Aug. 9th 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That is indeed a tragedy....but many military strategists predicted that over million Japanese and American soldiers would have been killed in the land assault that would have taken place if the bombs were not dropped. Many survivors of the POW camps predicted that their guards would have killed all of the POW's to hide the evidence of cruelty.  So, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki indeed saved millions of lives.  But why did the caller say that we, Americans, should reflect on those historical events when 170,000 people were killed?.....and yet no mention of the Rape of Nanking is ever mentioned for its anniversary when  350,000  people were systematically slaughtered at the hands of the Japanese military?  Because the Japanese cleverly tried to erase it from its history. But they failed.  So, why am I writing about "liberation" and its meaning? Because many countries knew, beforehand, what was happening to China. Many countries knew and did nothing.  Just like many people (countries) knew what was happening with the Jews in Europe at the hand of Hitler's National Socialist Party.......and yet nothing was done.  Many countries knew what Stalin was doing to his own people in the Soviet Union.....and did nothing.   And as a result: millions of people were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered while other countries waited, appeased, and theorized about what to do.....including the Untited States of America. All in the name of "appeasement, containment, and sanctions"   While reading this book,  The Rape of Nanking , I found myself constantly thinking of the people of Afghanistan and Iraq and their plight. I thought about how many years they went imprisoned and intimidated by ruthless regimes while other countries like France, Germany, and Russia knew of their situation...and did nothing to stop it. Indeed, they profited from the situation, all while hundreds of thousands were enslaved, imprisoned, tortured and murdered for years....decades.  Many Liberals state that they do not think the war in Iraq was  worth it  to liberate the people of Iraq. They often times state that we "should have waited for the inspections to be overwith before we invaded." This assumes, of course, that after we found no stockpiles of WMD's (only capabilities of producing them) the US would have just continued to use sanctions and resolutions to contain Hussein because, afterall, it was working, wasn't it?  Well, those thoughts are luxuries to us as we sit in our air conditioned and heated homes while we TiVo programs, watch movies on our DVD players, and surf the internet.  But to the Iraqi people who were purposefully being starved by Hussein (and France was getting rich with the "oil-for-food" scandal....) and while children sat in prison cells awaiting torture, rape and death....waiting for inspections, sanctions, and resolutions to work their  magic  on Hussein and his sons was not an option. Certainly, not a luxury.  I am surprised when "bleeding heart" Liberals state this plan or idea to me in their blogs because I think it goes against what Liberalism used to mean: stopping social injustice and tyranny.  One man wrote in a blog comment that he did not think the Iraqis were  worth it  to liberate.  This statement brings me back to the Rape of Nanking. Many other countries did not think the Chinese were worth protecting so they let them face the evils of the Japanese.  Who are we to sit and decide who is to be liberated and who is not? Has our wealth and privilege in this country given us the right to decide these things: who is "worth it" and who is not?  I believe this ideology of the Left is why I read and re-read so many of the blogs out of Iraq and the soldier blogs as well. I long to hear of the good things....and there are many!....coming out of Iraq daily. Yes, DAILY.  I read about the Spirit of America working with the Seabees and Marines to teach Iraqi men how to use powertools: not for torturing children of the enemy like in Hussein's days, but for building things. I read about the Marines helping to build sewing centers for young Iraqi women who need to earn income. In the sewing centers, these women sew IP & ING uniforms and have a child care right there in the center for their children!  All because some Marines thought the Iraqi people are WORTH IT to liberate.  God bless them all.  The Rape of Nanking, like the Bataan Death March, was purposefully kept from people for a time. It was reduced to a few sentences in history books until brave people came out and began to research it. Now, books are written about it and a museum is built to commemorate it.  As a painter, I will be doing an independent study on the Rape of Nanking this Fall at college. It will be my way of honoring the Chinese who were victims to one of the worst acts of human evil in world history. It will be a lot of work, but it will be worth it.  To all the Iraqi people.....what happened to you under Hussein will be in the history books because you are being heard. Tell your story so we all can learn from it.  Because one day, it may be  us , the Americans, who will need to be liberated from our enemies.......and I sure hope other nations like Iraq and Afghanistan will consider us "worth" liberating.   "Blessed is he who considers the poor! The LORD delivers him in the day of trouble;  the LORD protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; thou dost not give him up to the will of his enemies."  -Pslam 41:1-2

						   I got this e-mail today regarding Tommy Franks.  I heard him on the Sean Hannity show last week.  He was great:  Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2004 10 a. m. EDT Gen. Franks: Iraq Had WMD in 2003  NewsMax. com's Fr. Mike Reilly was on hand Tuesday when Gen. Tommy Franks, former head of the U. S. Central Command, launched the tour for his new book, "American Soldier," and picked up some stunning quotes from the man who led American troops to victory in Iraq.  Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak personally assured Gen. Tommy Franks that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction less than two months before the U. S.'s attack, the former Centcom Commander revealed on Tuesday.   "The Jordanians have reliable intelligence and sources in Iraq that say, in fact, that Saddam Hussein has biological and chemical weapons,"  Franks said King Abdullah told him. The Jordanian king passed the WMD intelligence on to Franks during a face-to-face meeting in January 2003.  The one-time top military man revealed King Abdullah's comments to ABC Radio Network host Sean Hannity, who interviewed Franks for his debut book signing at Huntington, N. Y.'s Book Revue. A warning from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was even stronger, Franks said.  In "American Soldier" the ex-Centcom chief quotes Mubarak saying, "You've got to be very, very careful, general. We have spoken with Saddam Hussein. He is a madman. He has weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons. And he will use them against your troops."  "A number of other leaders in the Mideast told us he had them, too," Franks told Hannity, adding, "If you were president of the United States, could you avoid paying attention to that?"   The capacity crowd cheered when Hannity announced: "How about Tommy Franks for president? I'll tell you there'll be no more terrorism." "We don't want our kids to fight," Franks told Hannity. "But sometimes they have to fight and when they do, we have to support them," he added, before saluting two servicemen in uniform standing in the back of the room.  "It doesn't take a lot of bravery for the general," Franks told the crowd, "but it takes a lot of bravery by guys like those standing right there."  The Iraq war commander, who calls himself a political independent, said he wasn't ready to announce which candidate he's backing in this year's presidential election. But he told Hannity, "I'm leaning towards George W. Bush."  Asked about Sen. John Kerry, Gen. Franks responded that because of the war on terror, America now needs its military more than it has in decades. "And we just need to ask ourselves, 'Is Senator Kerry going to be very respectful of the military of our country?'"  But he took umbrage at Kerry's decision to protest the Vietnam War while U. S. troops were still in harm's way. "I guess at the end of the day John Kerry will have to live with himself," the former Centcom chief said.  Gen. Franks also took issue with conspiracy filmmaker Michael Moore, who recently challenged Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly to say whether he would send his son off to "die for Fallujah."  U. S. troops, said Franks, "are not there to die for Fallujah; they're there to protect the United States of America."   (emphasis mine)

						   Found urlLink   this   on Blackfive's blog.....it is awesome!  More and more Vietnam Vets are coming out to speak about John Kerry's 4 months in Vietnam.  None of it is pretty............    Mudville Gzzette has an urlLink   interview   you should read. It shows the real motives behind Kerry's accusers. They won't be bullied into silence like Clinton's sexual conquests. These guys are out there and will remain out there in the limelight for 3 more months.  Is  urlLink  this   an adequate defense for John Kerry? This Robert Musil seems to think that "two wrongs make it right" will hold up.....   "Let's take some time out for a reality check. Yes, there is considerable evidence - and always has been - that John Kerry has exaggerated certain aspects of his military record but so have a great many very brave and noble combat veterans throughout history - and it has always been that way, in and after every war. To get a sense of how this is integrated into American culture, one might spend a few nights cozied up with some vintage movies from, say, the 1930's and 1950's, in which actors playing family members of veterans recount affectionately how the veteran's frequently retold war stories have him personally prevailing in the battle of, say, Chickamauga, Ypres or Guadalcanal. Or perhaps the reader has personal experience with such a cherished veteran - many people do. And it's not just ordinary servicemen who stretch the truth. General Douglas MacArthur, for example, was widely considered to have taken far too much credit for military successes in which he was involved - but that doesn't change the fact that MacArthur was a  urlLink great general worthy of great respect: "  Looks like character doesn't count much to the Democrats......again. How can it? If it did count in this election, then Clinton/Gore would be revealed as lacking integrity. It seems the Dems want us to think that character and integrity are not needed in the Presidency of the United States.  At a time of War......I wholeheartedly disagree.    This urlLink   book   will be worth reading if character matters to you.........there is a great urlLink   interview   with the author on NRO too!  A sample:   Voters tend to forget that presidents are, first and foremost, people. If they are unbalanced, nasty, and hypocritical, that will be reflected in their judgment and job performance. If a friend, an electrician, a plumber, or a job applicant had a track record of acting unethically, being habitually late, or displaying the kind of unbalanced personality of a Johnson or a Nixon, few would want to deal with him. Yet in the case of presidents and other politicians, voters overlook the signs of poor character and focus instead on their acting ability on TV.

						   I visited the  urlLink  blog   of a young girl from Minnesota. Her name is Jules and she is a Conservative 18 year old going off to college this Fall.  As I read her post in which she explains her views on the War, Pres.Bush vs. Kerry, and other issues...I was amazed at her clear stance.  More and more, it seems, lately I come across young Conservatives who are outspoken about their beliefs. I am thrilled, of course, because they are not shy in defending their world views. It pleases me.  It also takes me back to when I was 18 years old..............  I was also Conservative. President Reagan was MY President. I watched him debate Mondale and defend the right to Life on TV. I wished, oh how I wished, I could have voted for him in 1984. But I was only 16 at the time. Reagan stood for all I believed in: faith, values, military defense of country, defeating EVIL, and the WIll of God for our country....he made me feel so patriotic. I followed him all throughout high school.  As Gloria Steinam once hinted when asked about young women making more conservative choices today, she agreed that most young women are Conservative until they have to go out in the world and get a job. When they see what they are up against in the working world....they will become feminists real quick.  In a way, I agree with her.  I was Conservative until I entered into my 20's. Then I, yes Conservative ArtByRuth, was a Pro-choice, Democrat, Liberal, feminist.  It pains me to even have to write it down here, but I have to in order to make my point. Which is: that many young women will see their 20's as being a struggle, and so they may ultimately take up more Liberal stances on issues facing them. It doesn't mean they have to completely abandon their world view as I did. That only leads to depression, insecurity, and unhappiness.....which is what happened to me.  Compromise....in any form......is usually not a good thing. The Apostle Paul wrote about it in 1 Corinthians 15:33 "Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals."  I alligned myself with people who believed differently than I did when I was in college and, therefore, I began to compromise my principals and my innermost beliefs.  This left me feeling empty and lost. I finally woke up several years later when, thanks to Bill & Hillary Clinton, I realized I no longer identified with what the Liberals were saying and doing. My world view was challenged, and I didn't know how to defend it in my 20's. As I entered my 30's, I learned how to stand by what I believed in.  Everyone has a World View. How do you know what your world view is? Ask yourself and answer these questions:  1. Where did all life come from?  2. What went wrong with the world?  3. What is the solution?   An evolutionist would answer:  1. We evolved from that first creature that emerged from the primordial soup. Or, we evolved from nothing.  2. Human beings have ruined the world with: morality, religion, private ownership of property, sexual repression, democracy, etc.  3. More learning can end the ignorance; technical competence can be the solution; saving the planet from humanity will sove the problem; etc.   Or let's say a Christian answers the questions this way:  1.God created all life.  2. Sin entered into God's creation. Lack of repentance has kept us depraved and from reconciliation to God dooming us to destruction. All of creation is affected by sin.  3. Repentance through Christ reconciles us to God and we are saved by His mercy and grace. All of creation is redeemed.  These are World Views.  Being able to identify one's world view is an important step in maturation. Being able to defend one's world view is a vital step in survival. Compromising one's world view definitely leads to self destruction.....as Paul wrote to the belivers in Corinth.  They were slowly allowing other Gospels to be preached and, therefore, they were compromising Christ's Gospel message. This was leading to their demise.  My advice for the Conservative youth I see in my church and on these blogs is this: learn what your world view is, learn to defend it, then live it....without compromise.  I truly believe that once a young person truly learns what their world view is and if it truly has a solid foundation of truth....then compromise will not be an option.  So, Jules and other Conservatives out there....as you are about to begin your life journey: stay the course, know what you believe, then live it daily.......  Without Compromise!!

						   From National Review:   THE BUSH TEAM ON STEM-CELL RESEARCH [08/09 11:37 AM] The Bush campaign is organizing response messages on stem cell research. Judging by how often it was cited at the Democratic convention, the out-of-power party has concluded that the (false) charge that the president has banned stem cell research is a winning campaign theme. (And people have absorbed that message - a friend recently shared a story where a coworker insisted that stem cell research is illegal, and refused to believe that what the Democrats wanted was to increase the level of federal funding for research.) The Bush camp is sending emails pointing to this Charles Krauthammer comment: KRAUTHAMMER: Well that’s precisely right and it is part of the unbelievable demagoguery of the Democrats on this issue. Look, I personally support expansion of some of the federal funding of stem cell research. But you're absolutely right, the ban that they speak about is simply a lie. It is legal in the country of course, it always has been private universities are working hard on it. Secondly, there was a ban on the federal funding right through the Clinton years. They never spent a penny on stem cells.  The person who lifted the ban was President Bush  when he made his speech in August of 2001. So, the federal, right now the federal government is spending $25 million on stem cell research. So, to talk about a ban I think is simply to mislead Americans deliberately. (Fox News’ “Fox News Live,” 8/9/04) In fiscal year 2003, federal spending on stem cell research was $24.8 million. The administration also provided $190.7 million for human non-embryonic stem cells (adult stem cells, including those from cord blood, placenta, and bone marrow). Another interesting point: France, Germany, Austria, Spain, and Ireland ban altogether the destruction of human embryos to create stem cell lines. But maybe our policies aren't as nuanced and sophisticated as theirs.    Too bad Ronald Reagan Jr. doesn't have all the  facts  about stem cell research.   ********************************************************************************

						   It is becoming more and more obvious that John Kerry is planning on withdrawing our troops after he is elected.  He will blame the withdrawal on lack of diplomacy (France and Russia not wanting to send or train troops, etc.) which is all Bush's fault, NATO not wanting to get involved, and finally he will blame it on the Iraqis themselves by telling Americans that the Iraqis no longer want us there or in the region.  After reading this from  urlLink   RED State   , I am in total agreement with his analysis of  urlLink  John Kerry's interview   on NPR.  Although I disagree with the author's unhappiness with how the President is handling the war, I do agree with how he sees John Kerry.  It is a haunting read.  I am still waiting for John Kerry to finally say it, "After I am elected and soon after I am sworn in as President, I will withdraw all troops from Iraq and bring them home!"    He will say it because that is what the Liberals want to hear. None of them (Michael Moore, Hollywood actors, etc.)  have said they want  the troops to stay put.  Kerry listens to these people because he is a Liberal.  The only way to please these people is to end the war......not stay with it.  I am afraid that is the John Kerry plan.

						   Well,  urlLink  this   is more like it! Looks like the news is finally telling the story about   CBFTW's   and other US Forces' clashes with the enemy. About time.......this  urlLink  story   too.  ************************************************************************  As the storm clouds form outside my apartment window, I must re-read this  urlLink  story   and type FAST because I should turn off my computer soon.........  *******************************************************************************  Here is a funny  urlLink  photo  . Some people look  cool  and others, well................  *****************************************************************************  If you haven't already seen this  urlLink  web site  , please check it out.   "Operation A/C".   It is a great cause! Frankie Mayo is one fantastic chick. I have adopted a soldier and am now adopting a second one! I will be sending supplies out soon.  If you cannot afford to send an air conditioner, please consider sending some supplies to the guys. Also, you can e-mail the troops too! It is a great site. Have fun looking at photos on the site.  *********************************************************************************  No matter what  urlLink  this guy   says, this  urlLink  story   and  urlLink  these guys   are going to hurt Kerry........I agree with Instapundit, and others: Bush should come out and say he is not for this ad. It will look better than staying mum on the subject. [Clinton would have had Dick Morris take a poll by now to see how it should be handled..........]  John Kerry should have just SHUT UP after he came home from Vietnam. Most "heroes" come back from war and go on with their lives without constantly talking about their medals ( or ribbons since they are "interchangeable"). John Bradley ( one of the flagraisers on Iwo Jima) never even told his kids about his experiences in World War II. His son found the medals and photos of his father on Iwo Jima  after  his dad died!  Ok, so John McCain constantly talks about his experiences, but that is ok. I don't get tired of hearing it from him because he honors those he served with by telling their stories along with his own. Had he come home and protested the warand turned on those men.....well, I am sure I, and others, would feel differently.    Blackfive   has something to say about this and a  urlLink  question   for military personnel everywhere.....I couldn't agree more with his comments, by the way.  urlLink     Roger L. Simon  had a great post on his blog regarding a statement Kerry made about  urlLink  Christmas in 1968   Roger has a great blog with many intelligent commentaries. I recommend it to everyone!  **************************************************************************  Wonder what's going on with the Kerry campaign???  urlLink  These posts   are always fun...........  By the way, did you know that John Kerry is a Vietnam Vet??!!!!  **************************************************************************  The Kerry Doctrine...can it be trusted?  Jonah Goldberg  has some ideas  urlLink  here  . The scary thing about Kerry is that he wants to wait until  after  we are attacked  again  before he will use force. He says he'll wait until the threat is "real and imminent" before acting. But, as I have asked in other posts, what if what we consider "real and imminent" isn't what the Kerry administration considers "real and imminent"???  Seems he wants us to go back to Sept. 10, 2001 way of thinking......we  cannot  afford to do that any longer.  **************************************************************************    LOCAL NEWS:   John McCain supports Sheriff Joe's opponent. Read more  urlLink  here  .  Many of you reading this may have heard about our Sheriff Joe Arpaio because he is "tough on crime" and has the "Tent City" here in Phoenix. I must agree that he is indeed tough on crime and criminals, for that matter.  BUT after having worked for the Maricopa County and with many sheriff's deputies.....I must reveal that this guy is corrupt. I have heard a lot of horrible things from some deputies. I also have heard  praise  from some of his deputies who are doing well with their "double-dipping" (Being retired and earning a pension, while still being employed with the sheriff's department and earning raises, vacation time, health benefits,etc.)  Just so you know, I will NOT be voiting for the man..........    MORE LOCAL STUFF:    I know he was probably killed by friendly fire, but Pat Tillman  is still a hero  because he left a comfortable life behind to live a very uncomfortable life in battle. He did what others refuse to do. When someone asked, "Who will go?" Pat Tillman answered, "I will." Visit his foundation's web site  urlLink  here.   It's a nice web site.   Local radio talk show host,  Barry Young , lists "The 5 Things We Can Do Right Now to Make America Safer"  urlLink  here  . I agree with him 100%!!  ******************************************************************************   urlLink  Bad news   for   Kobe Bryant.   I wonder how his defense team will destroy, er, I mean  handle  her on the witness stand......  *****************************************************************************   Go Rudy!!   I agree with  urlLink  his views   on John Kerry's comments yesterday regarding Bush's response to the Terror Attacks on the WTC........why is Kerry listening to Michael Moore??? Look what Moore did for Wesley Clarks' political career!  *****************************************************************************   George F. Will   has some interesting  urlLink  questions   for John Kerry..........an example:  "Regarding military action, your platform says "We will never wait for a green light from abroad when our safety is at stake." But the platform's preceding paragraph denounces President Bush's "doctrine of unilateral pre-emption." If unilateralism is wrong, are you not committed to some sort of "green light from abroad"? "  and......  "The Clinton years were, you say, glorious because "we were not at war and young Americans were not deployed." Did not the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, followed by the attacks on the Khobar Towers, the USS Cole and the East African embassies mean we were at war but were uncomprehending? Have not scores of thousands of young Americans been deployed, ashore and on ships, since 1942? "  Too bad Kerry will never answer any of these.......   *******************************************************************************   Josh Marshall   has some urlLink   input   into the Swiftboat "scandal" and John Kerry.........example:  "You'll remember that friends of the president pulled this stuff with John McCain back in South Carolina in 2000. And McCain just told the AP that this swift boat nonsense about Kerry was " urlLink dishonest and dishonorable " and called on the president to disavow it -- something his spokesman, Scott McClellan has now declined to do. So I figure I can get him and Kerry to sign up without much problem."  [I honestly didn't pay attention to the 2000 Political race and so I don't know what it was that Bush's campaign said against John McCain in South Carolina. If anyone knows or has info. please let me know! Thanks.]  I do think Bush needs to come out and say something about it....soon. urlLink   Rush   seems to think he will.  ******************************************************************************    WEATHER UPDATE:   It is actually  COOL  outside here in Phoenix, Arizona in AUGUST!! Rain clouds are everywhere and it is windy! You just don't know what a miracle that is unless you have lived here in the Summer. God has been gracious this year in that we really haven't had that bad of a Summer.  The year my son was born (1995) it got up to 126 degrees. Bleh.  ****************************************************************************  Whatever happened to FREE SPEECH?? Read this  urlLink  bit of interesting   info.....  ***************************************************************************** Interesting comments from AYS, a dentist in Iraq, on his  urlLink  blog   . Iran is getting too involved in Iraq now. CBFTW was fighting the al Queda fighters this week. He reveals to us that it was indeed Iran's hand in the attacks.  Hmmmm, what will President Kerry do with Iran??????? Wait until they attack us??? Makes me wonder....  ******************************************************************************   urlLink  Iraq Now   is a great blog to read. He has some comments on CBFTW's recent posts. Worth reading!  *****************************************************************************  Where were YOU on   September 11, 2001  ??  Chris Missick  has some insights on his fine  urlLink  blog  . It is a chilling read. I think everyone needs to remember what happened on that day. Read the comments posted, too.  I feel that John Kerry and the Democrats want us to forget that the attack was an act of WAR. At the DNC, they treated it as a natural disaster!  It should be remembered....and when you do remember it. Do you think of John Kerry? Or do you remember how President Bush was there in the debris talking with the firefighters. He met with the victims' families for 2 hours.  That is why the Dems and Kerry don't want YOU to remember that day.........but we have to. For all of those who lost loved ones, we must remember.  ******************************************************************************* Ok, ok...I admit it. I am a  STAR WARS  geek. I love the movies, all of them. I am anxiously awaiting the release of " STAR WARS   Episode III: Revenge of the SITH"  Ooooh! Sounds so cool!! I am thankful that I gave birth to a STAR WARS fan, too. My hubby just doesn't get it. He is a "Rocky" fan.  What should the last line be?? Think about the possibilities!! Read  urlLink  these   ideas...they are classic!!  ****************************************************************************  That's it for now! God be with all our troops. Remember them in prayer today.  For our soldiers and Marine's in harm's way.......please hear their cires, O Lord.  Psalm 70: "Be pleased, O God, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me! 2 Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt! 3 Let them be appalled because of their shame who say, "Aha, Aha!" 4 May all who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee! May those who love thy salvation say evermore, "God is great!" 5 But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not tarry! "

						   I went hiking last night up a small mountain here in Phoenix: North Mountain.  When I write, "last night" it sounds like it was dark, but at 7pm there was still plenty of sunlight.  I ran up the mountain's paved road and did some deep thinking, as I usually do when I am running. I think that is why I love to run so much! My husband doesn't understand how I leave as soon as he gets home to go "run up a mountain". After spending all day with my 9 yr. old son, I need and crave the solitude.  Anyways, the mountain is a smaller one, but it is a tough run. The inclines are pretty steep at times and just when you feel like your lungs and legs are about to explode, the road becomes straight and you get a break before the next hill.  My thoughts were on the books I just finished reading:  urlLink  "My Hitch in Hell"   and  urlLink  "Bataan"   . Both were written by survivors so you get a first-hand account. I've tried to read books by historians and their thoughts on Bataan, but I just can't get into them knowing that the author never even served in the military.  As I was huffing and puffing up the next hill, I thought about what these men went through.....many of them enlisted to beat the draft so they could choose where they wanted to serve. They had left jobs, family, and the effects of the Great Depression behind them with hopes of serving for year or so then coming back to the US to finish college and get on with life. Most were in their 20's.  When these men landed in the Philippine Islands, they had no idea what was about to happen to them. Their real life accounts were over shadowed by Pearl Harbor. Indeed, I had no idea that Japan attacked Clark Air Field the next day! The Japanese were pretty much drained after the Rape of China and needed the P.I. and other Pacific Islands. The Commander of the attack assured his Emperor that the P.I would be Japan's after one month.  It took 4 months.  Our soldiers in the P.I held off the Japanese even though they were suffering from dysentery, malaria, and starvation. Why were they weakened by these factors? Because FDR ordered MacArthur to leave the P.I and head to Australia and regroup. So, MacArthur left 75,000 US soldiers and Filipino soldiers alone on the islands with only the food and medical supplies they had with them. No reimbursements were coming.  After four months of fighting, the remaining generals were ordered to surrender. It would be the first surrender of American forces in our nation's history. The Japanese took all the leftover food supplies, medical supplies, and ammunition.  As I huffed and puffed up the mountain, I thought about these poor soldiers. Imagine if that happened now, today, in Iraq.  All our soldiers and Marines are left behind by their commanding officers with only the food and medical supplies left on the bases and nothing else coming.  Then, imagine our President ordering these soldiers and Marines to surrender to the insurgents (or "revolutionaries" to Michael Moore...) as the US commanding officers are in Turkey regrouping and planning the attack.  If you think the insurgents and terrorists who beheaded the hostages are bad....then you need to read about how the Japanese soldiers treated their POW's...namely, our US soldiers.  The Japanese had tried all their torture devices and methods out on the Chinese and had pretty much perfected them by the time they met up with our soldiers in 1942. Many of the authors stated that they had heard about the Japanese urlLink   atrocities   in China and were very scared about surrendering to them. But they had no choice. The fact that they had surrendered made many of the survivors feel like losers. There were no parades for them when they got home.  So, as I make it to the top of this small mountain and watch a summer storm roll over the city of Phoenix. I am in awe. Arizona has some fantastic Summer storms because of all the dust in the air. These dust particles reflect the light of the sun and make some spectacular sunsets. As the large dark blue clouds roll in, they cover the sun as it tries to set and the rays of the sun force their way through the clouds. The rays stream down over the city....like the glory of God.  I sat on this bench that is on the top of the mountain. (It was dedicated by the family members of a local artist who died young.) As I sat on the bench, my thoughts turn to CBFTW, Kevin (Boots on the Ground), Chris Missick, Blackfive, and Major Bellon (The Greenside) all military and all serving in Iraq.  I said a prayer for them and thanked God that these men have not been abandoned over there. Their Commander-in-Chief will not order them to surrender. They will not have to be tortured by their enemy without a fight. They will not have to work in POW camps anytime soon and pray for their next meal to come. Don't get me wrong, they are indeed in harm's way....there is a real enemy out there who want these fine men dead.  I sat and thanked the Lord for these men who are willing to volunteer and fight for their country. It left me in awe again. I prayed for their safety and for God not to remove His hand of protection over them. I asked God for a hedge of protection around their bases, the IP police stations, and our embassy. The privilege of prayer is not taken for granted by this hiker.  I looked around our city and took in the cool breezes. A cool breeze in August here in Phoenix is a gift of God. They are few and far between.  I am a better person for having read about these soldiers who survived one of the most horrific events in World War II. As painful as it was to read about one being hanged by his thumbs for 2 days followed by his testicles for another day....after being beaten for an hour by the Japanese, it has to be read. It has to be written about. I have to tell others about it. These men wrote their stories so others can read them and learn from them. I am a better person for having read many of the soldier blogs everyday. Their stories must be read and treasured as well.  I made my way back down the mountain and passed families making their way up. I passed some women talking on cell phones as they hiked down. I eaves dropped on their conversation about school and grocery shopping. I passed one elderly man on his way back up the mountain for the 3rd time! He had to be about 68 yrs. old and he was running up the mountain for the 3rd time that evening!! Amazing. I passed a woman walking her dog (poor dog..) up the mountain.  And I think: how blessed we are that this War on Terror hasn't affected us in the slightest.  Imagine the President telling us that we have to ration gasoline, sugar, steaks, and COFFEE. Imagine Starbuck's reaction to that one! Imagine us in 2004 using ration stamps to buy meat. The ACLU would be all over that! This country would go into shock.   But here we are in Phoenix, Arizona enjoying an evening hike without a care in the world. Except me....my thoughts are on these survivors of the Bataan Death March. My legs were tired from my run, but I tried to imagine what these men went through on that 68 mile "hitch-in-hell", indeed. If the dysentery or thirst didn't kill them, the Japanese soldiers did. They beheaded or shot anyone who stopped or fell down. Heartbreaking.   Could I survive something like that?  I wondered.  These men write about how they had a strong will to survive. They made up their minds early on that they would survive. They had the will to live.  After the march, they were imprisoned and beaten. Then they were shipped (literally) to Japan on a "death ship". If they survived the horrific conditions on the ship, then they were sent to a POW camp where they were forced to work in a coal mine....for 3 years.  I made my way to my Jeep and sat there for a while. As I drove home, I thought about these fine men and all they went through. One guy went through it all dreaming of when he would return to his wife. Unfortunately, after he returned home he was told she had remarried. Imagine that!! So sad.  So, my hike that night was a time of deep reflection and thanksgiving. I am thankful to God for His mercy. I am thankful to all the soldiers who experienced World War II and served so bravely. And I am thankful for all who served our country in all its wars and at peacetime (my dad and uncle, my bro-in-law, my brother,...my husband).  I am especially thankful for our soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan at this moment. For what they are going through, and for what they will go through...but mostly for  urlLink  what they have done  , I am truly thankful.  Like World War II or the defeat of the Cold War.....we may not see all the positive results of a free Iraq for many years now. But the point is, we will see the  urlLink  results.    As I made my way into our apartment and heard the blessed voice of my young son welcoming me home, I walked over to my husband and hugged him. I whispered, "thank you" to him and told him how proud of him I was. He looked at me strangely, but knew what I was talking about. Then he asked what was for dinner. (Typical Marine)  THANK YOU to all who are serving. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU.  Psalm 27:11-14 " Teach me thy way, O LORD; and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence. I believe that I shall see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living! Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; yea, wait for the LORD!"

						   The thing that scares me to death about John Kerry is that he is so much like Clinton when it comes to National Security. He leans too heavily on his advisors. Nevermind the fact that James P.Rubin (former Clinton State Department spokesman) is one of Kerry's senior advisors who once supported the strong theories of the link between Al Queda and Iraq's Hussein and now he has "flip-flopped" and no longer supports those theories. Kerry doesn't make time for terror briefings unless forced to.  Most of all, like Clinton, he doesn't think we are actually at WAR with terrorism.  John Kerry said in his speech at the Democratic National Convention that he will never hesitate to use force  after  we have been attacked.   After??  That scares me to death. After California is attacked?? After malls all over the USA are attacked? After schools are attacked??  ....after Nantucket is attacked?  He said he would wage war against "real and imminent threats".  Then he failed to define exactly what "real and imminent" means to him.  That scares me too.  What if a threat seems real to us, but not to him or his advisors??  What if, like in Somalia, the threat is very real to the troops on the ground, but not to the administration at home in the Kerry White House, so the troops are not adequately supplied for the "real and imminent threat" before them?  John Kerry's vagueness is a dim picture when placed next to President Bush's  urlLink  specific and detailed plan   of attack to those "real and imminent" threats as we have seen this week.....  This  urlLink  bit of information   coming our of Albany New York this morning shows me that this War on Terror is very real...  Howard Dean and others complaining that the President issued recent terror warnings for political reasons simply because the information was "old" are silenced. Homeland Security is working and thwarting attacks  before  they happen.  Thank God!  ******************************************************************  This article is worth reading:  urlLink  National Review Online     "Jim Marshall is a Vietnam combat veteran, a Congressman serving on the House Armed Services Committee, and a Democrat. After returning from a fact-finding trip to Iraq he had this to say: "I'm afraid the news media are hurting our chances. They are dwelling upon the mistakes [and] not balancing this bad news with the 'rest of the story,' the progress made daily. ... The falsely bleak picture weakens our national resolve, discourages Iraqi cooperation, and emboldens our enemy."     Could it be that the MSM is reporting only  negative  things coming out of Iraq???? For political reasons??  ************************************************************************  Al Queda and Iraq:   From the NYT on June 25, 2004:  Contacts between Iraqi intelligence agents and Osama bin Laden when he was in Sudan in the mid-1990's were part of a broad effort by Baghdad to work with organizations opposing the Saudi ruling family, according to a newly disclosed document obtained by the Americans in Iraq.....  American officials described as an internal report by the Iraqi intelligence service detailing efforts to seek cooperation with several Saudi oppositions groups, including bin Laden's organization, before Al Queda had become a full-fledged terrorist organization. He was based in Sudan from 1992 to 1996, when that country forced him to leave and he took refuge in Afghanistan.....  The document, which asserts that bin Laden "was approached by our side", states that bin Laden previously "had some reservations about being labled an Iraqi operative" but now was willing to meet in Sudan, and that "presidential approval" was granted to the Iraqi security service to proceed....."  ....At the meeting, bin Laden requested that sermons of anti-Saudi cleric be rebroadcast in Iraq. That request, the document states, was approved by Baghdad."  Other evidence of the link:  Clinton also believed in the al Queda/Iraq link before President Bush did.........[from Washington Times article June 25,2004]  "..during President Cllinton's eight years in office, there were at least two official pronouncements of an alarming alliance between Baghdad and Al Queda. One came from William S. Cohen, Clinton's defense secretary. He cited an al Queda-Baghdad link to justify the bombing of a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan.  Mr. Bush cited the linkage, in part, to justify invading Iraq and ousting Saddam Hussein. He said he could not take the risk of Iraq's weapons falling into bin Laden's hands....  The other pronouncment disclosed a close relationship between al Queda and Saddam's regime, which included specialists on chemical weapons and all types of bombs, including truck bombs, favorite weapon of terrorists."  When William H. Cohen testified to the 9/11 commission regarding the proceeding disclosures, he said that "bin Laden had been living [at the plant], that he had, in fact, money that he had put into this military industrial corporation , that the owner of the plant had traveled to Baghdad to meet with the father of the VX program." He said that "if the plant had been allowed to produce VX that was used to kill thousands of Americans, people would have asked him, 'You had a manager that went to Baghdad; you had Osama Bin Laden, who funded, at least the corporation, and you had traces of VX and you did what? And you did nothing?'  Is that a responsible activity on the part of the secretary of defense?"  Or a President of the United States?  President Bush did the right thing by ending the connection between Iraq and al Queda .... before  we were attacked with chemical weapons.   ******************************************************************* GOOD NEWS out of Iraq by Chrenkoff.......  Excellent points made  urlLink  here.    *******************************************************************  Have a  great day everyone and remember to pray for our troops!!

						   I decided to join the many bloggers out there simply because it was suggested by other fine bloggers and because I have many opinions I wish to share. Does that make me obnoxious?? I sure hope not.  A little about me in this first post:   I am a Christian.  I surrendered my life to Christ at the tender age of 7.   I am 37 yrs. old.    I am voting for Bush  (not just because I am a Republican...) because he is a strong leader in these times of terrorism. I admire him in many ways. First, as an alcoholic who quit drinking and credits Jesus Christ. I admire him for being loyal to his wife and loving her. I admire him for giving God credit for any strengths he possess and also for submitting to God as Sovereign Lord. That is important to me, since he is the most powerful man in the world and yet he submits himself to God. That shows me that President Bush is not about ego.   I am an Arizona native  and so is my husband and son. I do long to move back to North Carolina someday. We lived there for 2 years back in 1989 to 91. It was so green and beautiful and, frankly, I am sick of the brown desert.  Forgive my writing skills. I will usually write in a hurry as my husband uses the computer for his school work. He is getting his degree with University of Phoenix Online. We will both graduate from college in May 2005. 20 years after we started college! Well, needless to say, we are determined.   I am an artist.  I have been drawing and painting since I was 5. My favorite medium is pencil (graphite) but lately I love to paint in acrylic and use charcoal on my paintings. I will have some posted on my web site:  urlLink www.artbyruth.com  soon for everyone to see.  I love art. I love Picasso, Cezanne, Braques, for their expressionism. I love Hopper for his compositions. But my favorite artist is John Singer Sargent because portrait art is one of my all time favorite things to study. Plus, I love his watercolors too!!  Well, that is it for my first post. I will be posting political stuff soon because that is my current passion. I truly believe that this election will be one of the most important elections of our country's history since the Civil War. So much is at stake. Our security and well being are at stake. Tom Junod wrote a wonderful piece in  urlLink   Esquire    this month comparing the War on Terror to the Civil War and why this election resembles those times. He makes some good points. He is a Liberal yet he has begun to see the importance of what President Bush has been saying and he finally gets "it" much like Roger L. Simon has stated on his wonderful blog.  So, more coming up............   Blessings to all those soldiers and Marines in harm's way. God be with you all.
