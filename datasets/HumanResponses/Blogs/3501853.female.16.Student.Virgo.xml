      Today was a long day and it didn't even seem like a break from school. I woke up at like 11 with a migraine but whatever I got ready anyways. I went to Taco Bell around like 12:30...and ya. Then I come home at like 1 and my mom was all pissed off at me cuz I went to Taco Bell and cuz I didn't have my phone so I told her I'd go get it from Kevin but she didn't want me to take the car. I was getting a little ticked off cuz ya know I was trying to get the phone so she'd stop yelling but she wouldn't let me. Finally, we went to go get gas at Sam's and she yelled cuz I didn't know what I was doing with the gas and so ya we finally went to Kev's. I showed up at his house with like a 10 ft. sweater and bummy hair. haha My mom was all pissed off I left my phone, I went to tb and I was wearing this certain sweater so she decides to tell me that "my mistakes cost everyone something" and i'm like thanks ya know. god. So then for some reason I HAD to go to the mall while tim and my mom were in the gym. I didn't really want to but whatever, I went anyways. I got 2 shirts from 5-7-9, those and the 2 shirts I got from express, earings and a cd..I bought quite a lot this weekend for someone who's almost broke. After the mall I came home and tried to just chill for a while but then Arthur IM'd me saying he wanted to go get a bite to eat. That was fine with me cuz I didn't want 2 be moping around and I owed him for that one time I ditched him, sorry hun. Dennis called him and wanted to come too so he did. It was fine going there cuz I knew the route kinda but as soon as I entered gates oh man my driving skills went out the window and I never got them back lol. I got to Arthur's after a lot of reversing and what not and got to Dennis fine. We chilled at Dennis' for a bit so they could "study". They told me to call Kev so I did but he wasn't answering so then we left for Barnaby's. Okay fucking get this...I didn't see a stop sign by the park at the gates and I was doing like 40 over the stop sign and right as how I'm supposed to leave the gates there's a fucking cop behind me with his lights on and I got pulled over. My heart stopped :'( He asked for my license and insurance. I was trying to hold in tears cuz of the boys there but I was scared outta my mind. Then another cop comes by this cop and after like 5 minutes they finally tell me that it was just a warning and be careful cuz there's lots of lil kids. I was so scared and when we got to Barnaby's I was still in shock lol. Anyways so we got food and talked about girlfriends and what not, it was kool. Dennis was telling me his metro story lol. Then we talked about my puke from Dennis' house and they told me something I didn't know which now I think is really sweet and makes me think he did used to care..anywho, then art was talkin bout his luv problems and food obsession. denis is single now and Art might be soon. Best luck to both of them. Then I had 2 drive them 2 get cigarettes and ya it was a kool time and all but it kinda made me realize how I kinda don't want this summer to come, it won't be like last summer for me and I don't want it..well I'm gonna go eat and watch the Lakers game now. Bye "i never meant to be so cold"

      I tried to be happy today or at least forget my problems. It worked for the most part. I went to a family party today and saw family I totally forgot about because I haven't seen them in ages or people I didn't even know were my family. I saw my old cousins who I used to spend like every day with, they were nice. This one girl who's a freshman in mw I guess talked about me before cuz she saw me in the hallway and so we got introduced, she's like gorgeous. Then this one lady who I think is like a 2nd great aunt lol signed me up for a beauty pageant for philipinos in chicago suburbs and I said sure but I was jsut being nice, I hope she doesn't go through with it cuz I'd lose so bad. After that me, tim, and my mom went around Golf Mill a bit to kill time, I saw Joanna at 5-7-9 hehe. Then we had to kill more time cuz they didn't want to go home and we had to go church like 2 hours later anyways. I went to Dominick's so I could cash my check, 60 dollars..lame but oh well, money is money. I get jealous sometimes cuz people have such high paying jobs and mine isn't but as much as I complain, my job is pretty easy compared to others. Just one of the many things I've been realizing. So after I cashed my check in, Tim needed to get something from Home Depot but somehow they forced me to go into Menards with them. Britte was working, i

      Wow so I've been in Malibu, CA since Saturday and it seems like paradise but honestly, I just want to go home and lay in my own bed =\. I am such an idiot, yo. I left like 6, maybe more, CDs in the airplane because I puked so I totally forgot to get the CDs out of the seat compartment and I just remembered last night so we called the airport and they said it's not in the Lost and Found so they probably threw it away. First of, why would you throw away something that does not belong to you, regardless of wether it was in a CD case or not?! Second of, I don't think those airport idiots know how much those CDs mean to me! I'm not going to come out and say what the value was but the CDs I remember I left there was: Toby Keith's latest album...w/ "Sweet" & "Whiskey Girl" in it Something Corporate : North Brand New : not Deja Entendu but the older one..sorry my brain is too caught up and everywhere to think of it Fall Out Boy : Take this to your grave New Found Glory's newest one and the last one was a mix he made for me..that was the biggest loss... Okay besides that whole CD thing which I'm very upset with, even if it sounds childish, I am upste with it. It just goes to show that all I'm good at is leaving stuff that I care for and losing. Anyways, all I've been doing here so far is going to the beach. Seriously, it's not even funny I feel like I go to sleep at the beach and wake up at the beach. I'm not complaining though because it looks like paradise by the ocean but..I don't know..I really though getting away for a bit would make me happy..but it hasn't, I mean don't get me wrong, I"m having fun, but I'm not really all that happy...I read her Xanga and I am the most blind fool alive but I just miss her so much, if I could I would rewind the clock all the way back and do it right...I talked to Kev last night and although I didn't tell him what was really on my mind but it helped just to talk to him. I just want to go home and sit on the rock and talk to him or talk to Ana on the phone. But anyways, I'm working on Kev's "project" it's really just a painting but, the "project" that I won't tell him about is what the painting is on. I feel like top-secret haha. On a funny note: my mom is completely sunburnt she looks like a piggy lol but I'm just really dark. Today is my grandma's birthday so we're going shopping and watch a movie and I'm buying her flowers. Yesterday I had lunch with Danielle, he's so tall now. It was nice seeing an old friend from waay back but remembering how much he hurt me in the past, I couldn't even give him a hug. I know that hanging out with him during this vacation is a step back in my life instead of a step forward which is what I need so I ended it with just the lunch. Tomorrow, I'm going to the beach again and then going downtown to shop and hopefully I'll get my baby my baby that I refer to is the Louis Vuiton purse. Okay well...I don't know what else to say...my head's thinking enough for the whole world, I'm surprised no one can hear it...g2g watch dawson now b4 I go swim then out... "...wherever you go, whoever you're with...you'll always have...a little piece of my heart..."-dawson's creek

      Today was..a day. lol. I woke up did the usual. Dawson's Creek, talked, and thought haha. I also watched Gothika, it was a freaky movie but it was good at the same time. Mik called during the movie so after the movie, I got ready and went to her house. We watched 50 first dates then we went to Kfc with her dad for dinner.. I   "A pictures worth a thousand words But not worth the words I need to hear I miss you so much that it hurts And tonight, I wish you were here So I could make you see The stars, they lay across the sky so perfectly And they remind me of All the times, when we used to sit underneath them, those summer nights .It's not alright, I won't give up, I can't let go, of you. I can't let go of you.And tonight, I close my eyes and dream that we're still one, I'd walk a thousand miles I'd swim across the sea What do I have to do, please just tell me" -matchbook romance  "California, here we come..right back where we started from, california"-phantom planet  Bye blogger, I'll write in a week from now =\

      Today was actually an okay day. It seemed like the first real day of summer for me even tho a month of summer has almost passed by. I hung out with Lissa during the day, thanks for the date Raggeddy Anne. We saw Dodgeball and it was funny. Afterwards, we went to Coldstone and ate lots of ice cream. She took me home and I took a long nap. Woke up to a call and let's just say I blasted my new fave Oct. Fall song up after that. I got my fucked up report card and now my mom thinks I'm a failure who's not gonna be able to get into college but w.e Idk right now so I packed some more then I rushed to Carson's to get stuff but it was close so that was a waste. After that I called Kev up and I drove to his house, picked him up and we went to Lake Opeka just to talk for a while. We just kept laughing and making fun of each other then making up again so it was funny convos but with serious stuff liek talking about our regrets and the things we miss. Man, I wish Kev's heart never got broken. He's too good of a guy. Well I'm going to go lay down and think about what I miss now but here's some songs..  "Tell me what I have to do tonight Cuz I'd do anything to make it right To be us again.  Here I stand with everything to lose All I know is I don't Want to see the end. I'm reaching out for you Won't you open up your heart And let me come back in.  Look at me I'm way past pride Isn't there some way That we can try To be us again Even if it takes a while I'll wait right here Until I see that smile That says we're us again."-Lonestar : Let's Be Us Again  "Too bad, Let's make it of what we have. Life gets so hard without the best. Can't send this down, I'm sick of this life when it comes out of me...  How does it feel, you wanna know? I'm so distraught, I can't be left alone Never, seems forever. Days still take down in December.  See into this break, And the memories here tell me, Do they care, to care? When will I lose this burden I wear? And do they care, to care?  Get you back into my life, Gotta get you. Get you back into my life. There's no way that I can do this right. Gotta get you, Get you back into my life, Yeah...  How could this be a day to me? Like a shame to me. Regretful thoughts they break me, Make me see, without you I can't be me.  See into your brown eyes, Turn into your brown eyes. See why your world is down, And I don't make a sound. I just wanna see you, Just wanna be you, Cause I don't wanna let you down...  See into this break,  And the memories here tell me, Do they care, to care? When will I lose this bruden I wear? And tell me, Do they care, to care?  Get you back into my life, Gotta get you. Get you back into my life. There's no way that I can do this right. Gotta get you, Get you back into my life."-Rocket Summer : December Days        urlLink Take the test , by  urlLink Emily .

      Another not-so-good day. Once again I woke up to watch Dawson's Creek and laid around to think the whole day. I had work at 4 though, really slow day. Now I'm home watching 50 1st dates, I remember seeing it with someone it's a memorable date but it's a little sad right now, let's just say everything I wish for or want back keep drifting farther away but anywho I don't feel good so I'm just going to go now... *Everything's changed except the way I feel about you-Lonestar

      It was an okay day today. I woke up and watched Dawson's Creek then started packing but I didn't finish, I just took lots of naps and thought a lot. I worked out for a bit at RecPlexx then I picked Arthur up. We went cigarette shopping for him, ate at Panda Express for me, then went to Lake Opeka. After I dropped him off, 99.5 played Lonestar and going home wasn't a good ride for me. Came home, talked to jon and kev. I love kev lol I really do I'm glad I'm showing it now, I hope he's noticed cuz I don't want to lose him too. Anyways, I know what to get him now for his birfday yay. K, I still don't feel good so I'm going to get sleep. *i miss you more than life itself and even if it looks like i'm not thinking of you, you're all i think about. *life will give you a 1000 chances to reconcile and 10000 chances to make mistakes but it only takes 1 drastic mistake that leads up to a 0 chance of reconciling that can makes a person realize all of other's life chances were small change to this.

      Another wasted day..it was father's day though so I went to church with Mom and Tim then we opened gifts, my mom got him boxers and shoes and I got him 2 shirts then we went to Old Orchard to buy my grandma stuff we can bring to cali and buy tim stuff I didn't feel up to shopping so I didn't buy anytihng. We went out for lunch, the food wasn't that great. After that, I went to work til 8:30. I don't feel good so I'm just watching movies with Tim now.  "I can't run anymore, I fall before you, Here I am, I have nothing left, Though I've tried to forget. Without you, I can't go on, Anymore, Ever again. I'm sorry, In all my bitterness, I ignored, All that's real and true, All I need is you, When night falls on me, I'll close my eyes, I can't lie anymore, I fall down before you, I'm sorry. The pain consuming me, But this time it's cut too deep, I'll never stray again."-evanescence siht rof dekcerw yats i-taking back sunday

       Horrible day...   I fucked up my life. I really did this time and I know I've cried wolf before and called for help in my life but this is one of the rare times that I really do need help that this is no cry wolf but I fucked up. I fucked up my life so fucking bad. Why don't I ever learn lessons and when I do learn a life lesson, I learn it too late and why do I always take for granted what I know is most precious to me, why did I fuck this up. All I know is...this is really the bottom of the depths right here: it's hard to breathe, the beating of my heart is louder than my mute voice and my pupils can't even be seen anymore from the tears...I'm living a life of a big regret, I fucked up one of the greatest things that ever happened to me and living this life of regret just makes me want to call quits on everything; suddenly, everything lost its importance...I'm walking but I'm invinsible,depressed,empty & dead inside...I'm here but I'm really not, what held me together is gone and it's my fault...I see my reflection in the mirror but it's not me, the mirror shows someone worthy of being here, what I am is the person I hate the most, the person who fucked up her life so fucking bad that it's not a life anymore, the person who took for granted everything and is alone, the person who is so fucking stubborn and so fucking blind that if she does learn a lesson and change it's too late, what my life is is dead and I wish I could just sleep for the rest of eternity. I've lost mostly everything I love and need and that that I did not lose I'm so afraid of fucking up. I don't want/need/care for my life anymore.

      Today was long. I don't really want to talk about my day because although it was uneventful, it was emotionally overwhelming. I thought sitting at home would help me forget but I just sit at bed crying and screaming, I can't go on living, at least not like this. I mean ya I've changed and I'm not running away from my problems but I'm just standing still watching things not get better, it's not any better than running away. I IM'd her today but I'm not sure if she got it or not. I was like shaking typing it. Anyways, when my mom got home, we went car shopping. We went to a Hyundai dealer and they had bogus cars so we ended up at a Toyota dealer. After a while of looking, we got really really interested in the Toyota Scion XA. It's new just a month old so all they had was stick but we got to test drive one automatic. I like it a lot, so does my mom. She was giggly and hyper about it. She's actually pretty when she doesn't have her bitchy look on. Here's a picture of the car: http://www.scion.com/drive/gallery/drive_xa_gallery.html Anyways, the people still have to make her car so we can't get it til 2-4 weeks from now. But when she gets it, I get the Rav4! She's giving it to me. I'm really thankful. All she's doing is making me pay 500 dollars which isn't bad since she's paying for the new scion and the rav4 still so it's close to a 1000 a month for her and all I have to pay for is gas. Tonight, I found a new found love and respect for my mommy. We were driving home from the dealership and we weren't talking because she was on the phone with Tim. When she got off, she looked at me and she saw a tear run down my eye and I was like "Mom, I think I'm going to cry right now. I can't help it so please don't yell" and instead of her normal bitter loud answer to my cries, this time, she was genuinely concerened and was asking "why sweetheart?" and she said it gently. I think she knew it was different that time cuz I don't usually cry in front of her unless it's from her or for some stupid reason and usually I don't cry just out of nowhere. So then I told her some stuff, actually I told her a lot of stuff in little sentences. I told her that I miss my best friends and I miss having the one person who really understood me. I told her that I have Ana and Kev but I've been so sad lately because I'm too stubborn to express how I feel but I miss her so much I just need her back I need her to know that I really am sorry and would take it all back. She just took my head and she said aw sweetheart i love you and pulled my head closer to her and let me cry in her lap. She told me some wise advice that seems so simple but just hearing it from her, i dunno. I love her so much. We've gotten so close this past month. She is so much wiser than I ever gave her credit for. Okay I'm ready to stop thinking...

      Short entry. Today I: ran, took a bath, went to work, called tom to see if we were going to see shrek 2 negative, went to recplexx to work out, went to st. zach's parking lot to think, showered, laid down from too much thinking, went on-line, jon was sweet tonight he said he thought of me today watching just married he had good timing telling me that cuz before that i was just thinking of how it seems i was right that it seems like i'm invinsible now and worst of all, it seems that even my name is prolly erased from  his  mind. Okay, just saying that is enough because now I'm going to start thinking more and I don't wanna cuz my imagination is running wild right now and it's not good like Kev said I think too much, he's right I think..speaking of kev, we're good :-D well we were never bad actually cuz he said he wouldn't be mad at me for being upset but I still am sorry that he thought it was his fault I was upset..we had an amazing talk last night from like 12-4 in the morning, we were talking about the one thing we would never talk about in a million years: the time when we liked each other and how he's sooo shy haha, we also talked about hard times but most of all, the good times I haven't laughed like that in a while and he even was the one who wanted to stay and talk haha. I think talking to him and Ana have been the only things keeping me sane lately, that and memories. K, I don't wanna talk about feelings anymore or what I'd like because what I need in my life, is pointless to talk about when nothing's gonna change, I screwed up too much to ever fix it..."every wish i make will never come true"-fall out boy  This is where I say I've had enough And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises And I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any better. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence. Wandering this house like I've never wanted out And this is about as social as I get now. And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you Cause they would never do, I would never do. -dashboard confessional  I'm sorry I'm not me tonight. I can't fake another smile, instead I'm crying from fright. Tears I've tried to hold in come out when I think of everything I didn't do right. My heart breaks thinking of what I used to have, my life was a perfect light. Perfect till I ruined it all so now I'm as empty as night. Although I'm happy I've kept some good friends I can't replace those I lost,  without them, nothing seems right. -me

      I had work. Lakers lost today. Pistons got the championships. It was a humiliating lost. I actually agreed with Danny on how pathetic they were tonight. Eh not a lot to say on this thing.."There's nothing I could say that could matter, that could matter enough"-New Found Glory...I just need to apologize to someone. Okay well someone asked to hang out tomorrow and I'm not sure if we are or not cuz I"m supposed to call him but I don't know, I haven't really been following through with plans with people lately and it's not that I don't love them or that I don't want to, I just Idk but anywho..if we do hang out we might see a movie so I wanted to ask Kev if we wanted to and he said no I'm chilling with the crew..and I just broke down and I need to apologize ten fold to him. I made him feel bad for saying something he had no intention or even thought would make me break down but it's little things like that that do lately and I hate breaking down in front of him, I've been trying so hard not to like I just do by myself and try not to talk about it to anyone but I did it in front of him and I made him feel bad and worry. Kev: I'm so sorry.

      I'm going to work in a bit but I got extremely bored and upset so I thought I would just write...Let's see I didn't write yesterday but what even happened yesterday, absolutely nothing...I was watching Maid in Manhattan, ran for like a mile, I went walking to and somehow I ended up walking from Friendship Park to the other side of Westfield where I totally don't live by so I made a big circle around Algonquin it was crazy then I laid outside for like an hour and a half just a bunch of thinking..after that, I did absolutely nothing..oh I did do a lot of complaining about the dumb ugly bathing suit I tried on I kept complaining to Art and Kev, I even sent Kev pictures from the digital camera so he could tell me how much it sucked..we both hate the stupid top cuz it looks like it's soo fake but I didnt' even buy it for that. So that made me pissed then me and Tim got this one movie Paycheck to watch, wow it was so fucking horrible. It had to have been the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, I kid you not. Do not watch Paycheck people, it sucked ass and Ben Afleck can not act...'He' had a bad day yesterday, I couldn't help cuz we don't really talk...but regardless of how much I care, right now, I just hope he feels better. Someone let me have that much of a wish since nothing else is ever gonna come true. Hmm today Arthur wanted to get breakfast but we had no rides so we put a raincheck on it then I watched Dawson's Creek good stuff then I talked to Kev for a bit til he left but hopefully we'll hang out before I leave for California just so I can get my saves the day cds back lol JK I just wanna see the loser and hang out w/him a lot lots. I'm glad that I at least haven't managed to fuck up me and kevin, we've fought once before but I don't ever wanna do it again. Ana called today and we were on the phone then out of nowhere my doorbell rings and these 2 guys are like gluing up my driveway to fix it up I guess but I go outthere, my night shirt only, and they don't even say anything to me..wow, it was very freaky. I was like shouting at Ana after that cuz I was just very freaked out. They left after an hour thank goodness. I watched Mona Lisa Smile and it made me cry cuz it reminded me of how much I miss two of my best friends. Overall, it was good tho, good actresses in it. It made me miss acting but I suck at it now. Oh welll. I got ready for work after that and I blasted 99.5 and a good song was on..k ya..work's gonna suck but oh well, there's a game on tonight, I doubt the Lakers will win but I'm still wishing for it...

      Today wasn't that bad I guess, it wasn't good but whatever..I was with my mom most of the day so I had to fake it off..Went to church in the morning that was fine I guess..but it sucks I mean I want to have faith and I know it's times when I feel this low that I have to have faith but it's hard to do that when all the prayers and sorrys I have been telling God just isn't happening but whatever..I called Ana after that because she was supposed to get picked up at my house so I waited for a bit but my mom wanted to go to the mall right away and I couldn't sit there and explain that we needed to wait for Ana so I talked to her and she said it's fine she'd find another way..I felt like a bitch and I felt really bad because I didn't follow through, I did her the favor last night but this morning but I just hope she didn't get in trouble coming home cuz I definitely don't want her to get in trouble. My mom and I went to the new outlet mall in Aurora..I took like an hour nap going there, I hurt my neck. I actually had a good day with my mom. We were talking about funny stuff I told her then we talked about our matching bracelet and why she gave it to me...being her only daughter, she just wants a connection with me and I guess she feels jealous when I pick other people over her or gets worried when I'm not around her and she gets jealous of my friends and that's why she's mean to me and I told her that ya in a lot of wayas I love my friends more [I didn't show it tho] but that doesn't mean I don't love her more than anything and altough I don't want to be like her anymore or have any of her flaws, it doesn't mean I don't love her as my mother.."just because a person doesn't see eye to eye with another, does not mean they should not walk hand to hand"...and I also explained to her my whole situations and how I've been feeling lately and when she says stuff I get hurt so I think now she's going to accept my feelings and know I'm hurting, she's even letting me keep sleeping with the sweater so ya it was a good [almost maybe great] day with my mom..I feel a lot closer to the bracelet now. She bought me Adidas rubber shoes today for working out and aerobics next year cuz isn't it sad? I don't own one pair of rubber shoes so I always have to borrow my mom's but i finally got one today. It's white and purple and pretty. She also bought me my new bathingsuit. I was going to get it at Pacsun but it was 100 dollars and really wasn't that cute so I went to this one store called Ziemel or somthing like that and it's just like Pacsun but more skaterish but anyways they had lots of bathingsuits so I got mine thhere and I like it a lot except it looks like I have honkers of love handles so I need to lose weight for it plus it was half the price of the pacsun one. I like it a lot I just need to go to the gym before june 26th. So ya my mom bought all that for me so basically all I really bought was Tim's father days presents. I got him 2 shirts from Eddie Bauer. The mall closed at 6 so we were forced to leave so we met up with Tim at the house and he drove us to BKK [by photo's] so we could eat Thai food. Yummy. Man, I just remembered I work Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday this week. I need to go work out. Now I'm home watching the Lakers game, we really really really need to win this game. I laid down on the couch and started watching it and a tear fell..I was remembering a time when he was here and would just sit there and listen to me whinea bout the Lakers...it's sad, my heart hasn't even considered letting go..I know it was my fault this all crashed but I would do anything in my power to try again but it's up to fate's hands and if fate would let me I would show him how I felt no hold bars but ya...Same thing with the other 2 people I hurt, okay tears again so I'm just going to stop now..and half time is almost over so I gotta go watch the rest...here's some good lyrics: "I miss my friend, the one who brought light into my life" -darryl worley  "Sometimes life ain't best if left in the memory. It's better kept inside than left for good"-nickelback  "Good morning day Sorry I'm not there But all my favorite friends Vanished... in the air [my fault, my fault]but it's hard to fly when you can't even run. Once I had the world, but now I've got no one"-3 days grace  "God damn everything, I remember being happy"-moneen  "The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself. For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath. She finally drank her pain away a little at a time but she never could get drunk enough to get them off her mind".-brad paisley & alison kraus

      So today was eh. I woke up and did nothing as I always do. I just laid around and thought for a while. I came on-line and Arthur was quite upset. He's having problems with Dennis so it sucks a lot, I hope things have worked out for him. My mom made me go through all of my clothes and find stuff that didn't fit or I didn't like. It took 4 hours to get through all my dumb clothes. But now I have space for more so that's a plus. I'm going shopping tomorrow. I thought for a while and I don't know I really want things to be back the way they are because all I do is reminisce the good times and regret my mistakes but I know she needs time right now, she has lot of shit going on so I can't go talk to her just yet...Anyways then I went to work. It was kinda busy but for some reason, I didn't leave till 10 when I was supposed to leave at 8 so I guess everyone else thought it was busy. Lissa and I were gonna hang out but she had a tummy ache so we rainchecked. Ana came over for like 10 min. when I got home. We jsut sat out in my backyard before Jorge came to pick her up. I hope she's happy with him, I know she is. Cuz even tho she's mean 2 him, it shows she cares about him cuz usually she doesn't relaly give a crap lol. I'm going to end this right now because I"m talking to someone online..I might write later, not now..

      Today was okay I guess, compared to the past days I've had this last month, this one wasn't that bad. I ended up sleeping on the couch last night but somehow I woke up on my bed, thanks mom. I got up and went on-line for a little bit but most of my morning/afternoon consisted of laying down and watching movies. I started bawling while watching Dawson's Creek for like the weirdest reason, I don't even really know why. I was just laying down inhaling the smell of the sweater and then Andie's talking to Jack on Dawson's creek and she said: You can't just leave without letting her know. I mean, that...that's not like you. You just don't just stand and let things happen and you don't run away either. You have to tell her that you love her. And you have to try to get her back. Because if you don't, I promise you, you will regret it. And then tears just came out cuz it's true like as much as I'm trying to pretend I don't care, I do care and I do regret all the bad stuff that has happened. Argh. Anyways then I went and ate lunch, killed the microwave cuz I can't cook or heat things up for shit. Then I went on-line one last time before going to work. I was talking to Art, I was supposed to go chill with him and Dennis at Dennis' house after work but didn't happen cuz ya I didn't call Art cuz Idk y really I didn't want drama between the girls that might have been there plus I just wanted to think. I talked to Lissa too, kool kool. After that I went to work. I guess Kasia thought I wasn't working so both me and Amanda came in and ya it was a big mix-up but I ended up working the night til 8:30. It was an okay night, not too busy. I had to help Alma hide from some stalkers of her. The guys kept smelling my vanilla, after a while I was annoyed but oh well. After work, I went to RecPlexx to work-out. I was on the treadmill for like 25 minutes then the rest of the 35 minutes that I was there I did 25 repeats on these machines: rotator chest, chest press, leg press, shoulder press, abdominal machine. For a while, all the excercising helped me forget about stuff but then I started thinking of how upset she is and how much I want to help her out or just hug her but I screwed up so I can't and thinking of how I screwed up help me excercise even more. Then I looked up to the tv and saw the date..it's the 11th..it would have been 5 months if only I wasn't stupid, I read his away message today and it said ouch, of course my pessimistic mind automatically associates it with a girl and it probably is and that hurts..it's been a month and none of my feelings have changed for either of them, her or him, I still love my friendship with both of them, it's sad to know it's unforgettable and nothing's gone back to normal...well I'm all sore so I'm gonna go..

      This day..ya..I don't even know quite what to say about it, I have to think it out first I guess. To make things clearer, I'm just going to post what I can make out... Okay so I was at school for some of the day. I finished my chemistry final and re-took an old chem quiz just so I could get a C in the class, I did it, got a 74 which sucks cuz I think C's are fails but in that class, I just needed to not get a D and I'd be fine with it, not happy but fine with it. Then drama finals was just dumb, I didn't really care. Then Szabo took me home, he's a funny kid. We drove his mom's pt cruiser and everyone knows I love pt cruisers.  Then I went home and basically laid down, thought, and slept a lot a lot. Seriously Ana and I called each other twice and I slept before and after each call and then I went online and she's like what are you up to and I felt so stupid saying I just woke up but I did so I had a total of like 5 naps. I hope she's notw orried because she used to just sit at home and sleep too the year after Louie's death and now I'm just sitting and sleeping but hopefully things will look up in reality soon where I don't have to sleep to escape..hopeful but doubtful..She and Jorge were having problems but luckily she's got it under control so that makes it now a year and something but it's so odd cuz i just remember it like yesterday her talking about a guy she met at bussee woods.  Anyways, then I went upstairs to take my 6th nap while watching along came polly and I rememebered I had to text Arthur so whatever I did and I guess him and Dennis needed a ride to a concert, the dp concert. At first, I felt awkward going so I said I"d just drop them off but then I went on-line and she IM'd me saying I should go to support so I went for her. I thought that tonight, I was going to gather up all the courage I had left, put away every ounce of pride or stubborness I have and say exactly how much I love aand miss her and how sorry I am. But fate just wouldn't work with me as usual. Well I'll get to why fate wouldn't cooperate later. Anyways I got Art and Dennis and that was fine and then we got to the theater, thanks to me by the way, I had to give myself directions somehow. We got there and it was weird cuz Matt p. saw me and right away goes inside and i'm like ookay.  Anyways, my heart was gut wrenching at this point like I told Art my hands were shaking like no mother fucking other. I was going to do it, work this out best I can cuz I need this. But then..I saw her smile and laugh with the gang and I don't know, I just couldn't get myself to go up to her and ruin her smile. So I thought I'd wait it out a bit. Things were awful for a bit just cuz I didn't know what to do so me and Art went outside and Michael n. joined us. He's single now. I just hope he doesn't regret it like I do cuz ya he might think it's easier now 2 deal w/his family issues w/out her but man when it's all said and done it's not easier so Idk, I hope the kid doesn't regret it and be sadder than he is now.  Then we went back inside after Art got his enphysema [lol] and me and Michael were just sitting there and I watched this scene unfold right in front of me and I swear to god, my heart broke. I just got so upset like omygosh no. That's when I knew I couldn't talk to her now, she was going through a lot more, she didn't need more on her plate. But I do kind of regret right now that I at least didn't say something like are you okay. Cuz after all this, nothing's changed, I still love her and when she hurts ya I still hurt. But I can't be anymore like dude don't hurt her when I hurt her too. =\ So ya, I'm just wondering if she's okay right now. But it sucks, I really needed to make amends with her but it was bad timing. Plus, I saw her with the whole gang and it's like camille you don't even know how she feels and I know the best way to find out is by talking to her but maybe i'm not prepared 2 hear the worst if that's what it's all come down to, i can't even like see happy things w/out missing her. I miss hearing her laugh [like i listen to that one voicetag but it's not the same], i miss singing country songs w/her or singing sublime together, i miss exchanging shoes for chemistry, i miss the hugs, i miss missing each other during theater fest, i miss telling each other stories that no one else would get, i miss stomping on states made from chalk with her at forest park, i miss her dog sniffing me after a dance, i miss listening to her, i miss watchin our favorite tv show, i miss sitting in back of cars on speakers, i just miss talking.  I don't know, I just hope my prayers can be answered. I'm over listening what other people say supposedly happened cuz I'd listen to my heart over what people say supposedly was said any day. I know it was my fault but that friendship means too much for my heart to let go, so we'll see, we'll see what happens... So ya that's that basically. I went by Kevin during Premium and before that too because ya I told him last night how much I didn't want to lose him either so he knows I mean this and we've gotten closer again yes. So ya I go by him, he's all giving me hugs which is fine with me it's kev kev who cares. But then I felt bad after a while because Jamie R. seemed upset with me for it. But I had a talk with Kevin and I just want him to be happy and I think he's learned not to hold back his feelings anymore, so hopefully it'll all work out with whoever the loser [lol] wishes. I can't remember if it was before or after Premium's great performance that I had my only little break down of the long night. But I was sitting by Kevin and I was upset but I could also tell he was upset so I didn't want to bother him but the tears were coming so I went in the bathroom. And ya I was weak but I just couldn't help it..I was upset over how she was hurting mostly and I was also upset over him. I don't really want to write about him and me because it hurts just to even think about it. But I cried cuz we don't even talk like I seriously thought we were going to be still great friends and we'd "never say bye" but we did, it sucks so much. No guy can replace him man, no one, I'm not afraid of saying that cuz I'm pretty sure that right now no there is no one else but him I even consider as a potential guy. But I cried over him a lil bit 2night because I saw him smile and his eyes gleam and that he's forgotten about me and the way his eyes gleamed, that used to be how it was when he saw me smile. But he doesn't know, only he could make me smile like that. My smiles now are so fake I can't even see what he saw in me in the 1st place. Only he brought out that one smile, and I can't ever get it back. I just wish we could talk about how we felt but I doubt that will ever happen. He likes so many other girls I bet by now, I wonder if he still knows my name but I got butterflies in my heart from him 2night,he talked 2 me well more like asked me for money but it was still his voice talking to me.  Man I am stupid for screwing thigns up with the both of them, fucking stupid. I'm stupid for another person but I can't deal with thinking of that right now ehh i might just cry 2 think 2 much of that. Anywho, after Dennis' hilarious incident with these 2 icky girls "bitch", me art and dennis went home. My dumb ass pulled out of the parking lot the wrong way so I had a whole bunch of cars headed for me and I had to go through the rail road tracks luckily they all saw i was in the wrong lane and let me slip by into the library's parking lot. We made a pit stop at billiard's for art then I took them home. My mom called me like no joke 10 times and I didn't pick up cuz I was with dennis and art and she didn't know that. So I got home and I was bitched at and basically grounded from the car for who knows how long. I don't car as sad as that sounds but this night just exhausted my emotions and I'm still feeling low so I don't really need a car unless she can drive me but besides that, I think she was just worried cuz it was raining really hard so hopefully I'll get the priveleges back.  Well I've wrote enough another time I'm thankful no one reads this czu this is just a lot of nagging and venting..but on a last note, to prove that today just was not meant to be my day, lakers lost bad...

      I'm watching Miracle right now with the parents so I'll make this short. Finals was decent. I aced the spanish and health and got a C in geometry which gives me B in the class or a C, who knows, I don't care. I'll care two weeks from now when the report card shows how much of a failure I am and my mom gets mad haha. I came home afterwards and basically I laid down from 1-7 just thinking and slept occasionally. Talked to Ana on the phone for a bit, she's a doll for calling. Yeah I don't really have anything else to say about what I've been thinking about because it's been the same thoughts repeating itself and I can't come to any sense of it, my brain's just thinking of a bunch of good memories and a bunch of bad flaws...Anywho, then my mom came home and took me to get my gym membership for 3 months so I have the whole summer to work out at their fitness center woo hoo, I love working out. When you work out, thoughts fade away and all your focused on is the pain but the feeling of finishing something. Then we got some vides to rent, got along came polly miracle reminded me of a gr8 memory and some other. My mom's getting a new car or she said she's looking for a new one so who knows, hopefully I can get the rav4. Art text me 2day 2 do something but I couldn't cuz I didn't have the car at the moment and plus I was feeling pretty down when he called so I'm sorry but maybe 2morrow. Man, one last final tomorrow. Szabo's giving me a ride home, thanks. I could've walked but he said I'm getting a ride haha.  argh g2g wake up at 8 2morrow...

      What a fucking long day and I am so incredibly sick of having long days for like what a month straight now. It's ridiculous. How much can a heart take? God. All I wanted to do today was get through school and finals and that didn't fucking work for shit. My mind was just thinking of all the stuff it's been thinking about for a while so I couldn't focus. I ended up not finishing my chemistry finals and for english, I handed in the paper but it's suppoesd to be 6 full pages ya it was like 4 so who cares. And I get out of there and it seems everywhere I go in that school or every person I see, just takes me back to the past so I got away and went to clean my locker. After that I turned my phone on and I answer it cuz my mom called and not even a milisecond into the fucking conversation, she starts yelling at the top of her lungs at me! She was 2 hours late for work and she's yelling at me like crazy and it's like omygod I don't need this. I don't need you, the person I least want to be, yelling at me for the dumbest reason ever. All she knows how to do is yell and make me cry. I do not want to be the person that yells when she's frusrtated at the people I love. Cuz it's so hard to be yelled at. It just drains your heart out of everything. Plus, I dont' want to be like her cuz she makes it so hard for people to love her, she never learns any lessons in life, she makes the same mistakes ever again and she doesn't care whether or not she loses people she loves but I do. I do care if I lose people so much it hurts but before I didn't leran any lessons and I made it so hard for people and so complicated for them, I don't want or need to be like that man. Argh, I'm just very frustrated right now. With everything else too. Not just with her. I'm going insane. Nothing in my life is working out and everything I do is another mistake. This summer is going to suck..:'(..I just need to lay down or something b4 work.."I can't take this I come unglued I just need this to be alright I can't feel this another night I can't take this I come unglued I might breakdown in front of you necessary to medicate I'm not sleeping, can't stay awake but if you need me I'll be here 1/2 unconcious to escape my fears"-staind

      Yeahhh I did not do my paper for my English finals nor did I end up studying for Chemistry, I am just too confused at the moment to even think of school work. Okay so I've been thinking about the news I heard first period since I heard it and I'm not quite sure what to make of it really. Then other stuff happened and now I'm more confused than ever...I'm so utterly confused as to what is happening, I don't know how to comprehend it even..the best thing would be to talk it out so both people know what is really going on...but who knows..I have no words, I just need to lay down...here's some lyrics... "Let me be angry, please it is the only way I can keep you from seeing how much you mean to me." -unknown "Two wrongs don't make it right and if I'm wrong, I ain't trying to fight."-wyclef jean "I want to make this work so much it hurts."-martina mcbride "It only gets harder the more that you know; You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down; We came together but we left alone;Maybe someday i will see you again and you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend."-yellowcard "makes you do the strangest things like act angry. It's your life, your move, your chance to make good of the bad. Can't hide the fact that you still lied but put the past behind, there's one more thing left to say."-moneen "i need you, tears on my pillow whenever you go"-destiny's child

      Today was long. It's hard to put a smile on your face when nothing is really all that well. But I don't want people getting all worked up or thinking I'm more of a brat than I am. Plus, it's my problems and I'm sure people are sick and tired of listening to it or trying to understand. I understand people have their own stuff to deal with and I'd rather help them out. First period I found out some stuff that made me more confused than I already am, if that is even possible. It feels like we've both been hurt, although I know it was my fault. But then again, it feels like there's been so much misunderstanding and as much as I want to clear everything up, I said that I would stop putting drama in their life. It's my fault and missing them is my punishment. But one last time, of talking things out, I would do anything to get that but that chance left me cuz I'm dumb but I don't know, I guess I'm naive but I'd like to hope that it's because I had so much faith and love in our friendship be4 I screwed it up that I"m not willing to let go of every single memory or every single hope that we'd talk again, my heart just can't do it. I'm trying so hard to change so this can never happen again but no matter what, even if I do succeed in changing into a better person, the prize of having the past back probably won't be what I'll get..argh..and then there's him...I know he wanted a break but it seems like this break is pushing us further apart and the longer the dayas go, the more scared I am to talk to him. For every human being, it's hard to say sorry and admit to your flaws but it's also harder to consider that maybe even when you do say I'm sorry, it's not good enough..I think I just need 2 give him breathing time, I don't want him more mad at me but I know for a fact I do not want to lose him so hopefully, I can say sorry in due time [just scared] but I know it's worth it cuz I'm exhausted from crying and I'm exhausted of being the girl that doesn't fix the wrong she's done. It's not worth losing my friendship with him just because of my stupidity and all my flaws. I'd rather just fix myself and lose the worst part of me...The rest of school was long and dragging after 1st pd..Pauly signed the yearbook and so did Kev, oh man, for Kev's yearbook I did 2 pgs and I had more 2 say but I ran out of space cuz weird ppl wrote like in humongous font on his hehe it's okay. Afterschool always breaks my heart. This is the one emotion I"m most prone to showing but I know I can't. I want him to be happy and everytime I see him from the corner of my eyes, he's smiling or laughing. I mean ya it hurts to know that smile or laugh isn't because of me anymore but it's because he's without me or it's because some other girl gave it to him. But his happiness is all I want, no matter how much it hurts..I just wish we'd talk..but I can't force him to talk to me if his heart doesn't want to, I have to force myself to be content with the memories and the smell from that sweater I smell every night..I just hope the next girl can show how much he is appreciated the way I didn't show it but most of all, I hope she can love him how much I do now...Okay this is enough rambling, all I do these days is ramble...it's pathetic...I'm sleeping so much now a days too it's sad cuz it's how I can stop my mind from thinking even tho sleeping doesn't cause the heart to stop feeling, sometimes I wish it would though..omygod plus I'm getting so fat now from actually eating it's so digusting to see, I definitely need to put that gym membership into work or better off, just run at pl cuz I need to get rid of this fat, it's hard enough to look in the mirror, I don't need to see fat either, sickly. Anyways, after roaming the halls for a while I went to the bus concourse to meet up w/brendan and mike novakowski (or however u spell it lol) and me and mike walked to kev's. We had a good talk going there, I really never took the time to get to know Mike so it was nice. He told me about some of his problems so I hope that gets better and I hope he just does what will make him happy in the long run, don't live life with regrets. At kev's, we were just all nerds and studied for a while then me and kev looked at yearbooks then joined mike and mikey to play baseball and then I went home..now I have to try and focus to study for chemistry and english..it's so hard 2 focus or even care...oh man it's getting hard 2 breathe again like I was walking up the stairs to geometry class and I get in the class and I stopped because I had to catch my breath I could not breathe for the life of me and diandra felt my heartbeat and it was going like 100 per second. My back's acting up again but I just want to ignore it, it's the least of my problems... "I'm twisted cuz one side of me is telling me I need to move on, and the other side I wanna break down and cry"-usher "I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you but I continue learning...I'm sorry that I hurt you, it's something I must live with everyday and all the pain I put you through, I wish that I could take it all away...I've found a reason for me to change who I used to be"-hoobastank "My Dearest Love, its almost dawn I’ve been lying here all night long wondering where you might be"-john montgomery

      Today was okay. I went to church and that was okay. Then I came home and took a nap. I woke up and went online and was talking to j for a while. It was like a normal conversation for a while then he asked who I like and he guessed the answer right and he's like ur hung up on him and I was gonna explain why I was but then I felt bad but of course he made me say it after that haha so I told him how for those 2 yrs that we were like on and off I've liked probably around 7 guys but none of them ever got to me to the point where they got me over j but then all of a sudden he came and that was it, it was done. I felt bad saying it afterwards cuz it was awkward after that and I prolly sounded bitchy but it's the truth. And argh, I"m just so fucking retarded. Anyways then I went to j's house before I went to work so he could sign my yearbook. I was proud of myself, I did not get lost going to his new house. Okay his new house is fucking huge. It goes on forever and ever. He's got a couch in his room, his basement is like double mine, his pool is humongous and he's got a bar next to it. The kid turned into like a millionaire. I saw Julie, she was a sweet girl, I miss her. Anyways, I only stayed for the tour of the house so like 3 minutes literally then we went outside so he could sign my yearbook. I knew it was going to be short cuz that's just his style, he doesn't reveal his feelings and he's too lazy 2 write wut he does feel or the memories so he drew this tiny lil picture. Then I went to work...work was pretty good actually. Jaysen got me pad thai so that was good. It reminded me of him. Then me and Kristen were talking about shopping and that reminded me of the other him. And a lot of stuff reminded me of her even Armando's new patio set he was talking about did cuz we had a talk on a patio set once. And I was all smiley while I was thinking all that but I felt pressure on my chest and stuff and as Mr. Claus calls it, anxiety attacks haha he's weird ti's not anxiety attacks when u get pressure on ur chest. It's like I was laughing and smiling but I'm like crying on the inside. Cuz I'd rather be smiling and laughign with them than anything else but I probably won't ever get that again cuz I'm duuumb. Well I don't want to write about this anymore, it's enough thinking going on as it is, well I'm gonna go watch the lakers game now.."Even those who never frown, eventually break down"-lp

      I'm exhausted from working and from crying so I probably am not going to write a lot but let's see, so I already talked about the chem. thing then I took 3 naps instead of writing my English finals haha [ya I actually slept, well more like closed my eyes but still thinking] then I checked my messages and Tom was talking about the tickets so I ended up getting ready sort of to go to Carson's really quickly to get the tickets. I called Kevin before we left, it was a short conversation though because my mom needed me, I felt bad but I had to call to make sure he was okay with the whole band thing. So ya, I got the Saves the day tickets, it was 60 total so luckily we had enough. He wants to see Harry Potter with me tomorrow but I doubt I can because I'm working and I have too much homework. Let's see work was pretty good. It was so busy though, I'm so tired. My manager bitched at me because my phone kept going off some # like 312 something kept calling, whatever. Ryan Plantz came in, it was funny. I was okay for most of the night then as I was leaving, Amy a waitress said a joke 'save horses, ride a cowboy' and I was laughing really hard but it was bittersweet because it reminded me of memories. So ya that got me crying...then I started thinking again about everything lately and it seems like there's no ending to it, this is the worst thing ever and i'm so weak all I do is cry about it. Argh, i can't even describe all the feelings I'm feeling right now it's like half of me feels empty then the other half is filled with a million emotions that I can't describe or seem to let go. I can honestly say, I have never felt this particular way in my life..Well I have work tomorrow again man that's 4 days in a row of working then there's a Lakers game..hmm maybe I should just go and try to start this english crap..."i'm so tired of being here, supressed by all my childish fears"-evanescence [i'm actually starting to like them]

      Remember not to let urself get so angry that u stop loving, because the second that u do, the person u love will b gone for good..ever have one of thoes days when u want to start over all over again...i have one of thoes lives..for everytime i make a mistake i wanna live my life over again, and thats reliving a lot of painful things, but honestly i would take all that back and do it again, instead of living a life of regrets//I got on the computer at like around 6:30 am and read that and it made me cry, not in a bitter synical way but in a sense that thhe tears came because it was just so true, so fucking true that it chilled my bones..Well I'm like 1/2 awake still, mainly because I really didn't sleep anywyas. I was just listening to the new new found glory cd, they're singing my life I tell you, especially failure's not flattering. I hope I hope that I get the Saves The Day tickets today, it's the only thing I have for the summer, except California but that's just for like a week. I really hope Kevin has a decent time, he's so nice for going even though I know he doesn't want to...he's having problems with the band and I really wanna help him cuz I really had a lot of hope for them, I like their lyrics a lot [hehe] but also, the boys are playing so good..but most importantly, kevin was happy with the band..I mean I admit at first, I was upset and hurt that it seemed like he picked the band over our friendship but that was really fucking selfish of me because I love that kid, I mean, the loser keeps me sane lol. I'm glad that he's found something to make him happy, I just wish it wasn't being complicated for him. Here's a quote I read somewhere.."happiness is temporary"..I don't quite agree with it but it is temporary only because life puts us through tests in the way of what makes us happy and we just have to pass them to regain happiness again. I'm starting to clean my room again and argh I gotta go to the chem thing I'll write about this later...Okay I'm back, so I went to that Chem. review thing and all I got was 7 extra credit points and I didn't learn anything at all. I did one problem that took the class a whole hour to do and I gave up after that so me and Liz just talked. We do have a lot of things in common, I feel REALLY stupid for ever being so jealous of her, yeah she's a great person you have no idea but she goes through pain the same way anyone else does and I was immature to hate her for how good she deals w/problems, I'm so happy for her and Dan though. So ya me and her just talked, it was nice. Then at like 11 Sergio gave us a ride home. Now I'm sitting here and I just want sleep but my brain is like on high-speed right now. I'm so frustrated, mainly at myself because I seem so stuck and I don't know where to go. I can take my old route and run away from it all and let things die down in time but that is the cowardly and selfish way of dealing with it and I am so sick of myself doing that. I don't want to be that. But then again, I don't know what to do. It's like everything I try to do or what I do do is like 'eh wrong step camille you just fell further into the hole you've created'. I've come to the point where I see what is wrong with me and all I want to do is fix it but I know the outcome(s) probably won't be good and i miss them sooo incredibly much, i haven't missed people this much since louie but it's like I'm soo thankful for people in my life now a days like I tell everyone online I love you cuz I know it's dumb but the way I see it you have no idea all the bad stuff life will give you or all the bad stuff you will end up doing so while you're at it, you might as well be nice to the people you actually care for because sometimes it might go away or it might be too late forever.In a way Jon was right, I was acting all my life out trying to make my life all perfect that I didn't consider how others felt really, all I cared about was having the people I love around but I wasn't around for them really but I don't want that anymore. I know in my heart it hurts more to see people I love hurt but I never showed or acted upon it. And I hate that but I don't want to hate myself anymore cuz I don't want Kev or ana to be disappointed that I do hate myself lol, I just want to be content I guess. I know I lost those I loved and that is something I can't do anything about but I geuss right now, my first step in all this I think is just to find out who I need to be in order to loook in the mirror and say yeah you screwed your life up but you changed so at least maybe you'll learn your lesson and although you'll be sad the rest of your life for this, you won't hurt anyone anymore for the next what 50 yrs of your life..argh okay now I'm not making any sense and I'm just rambling and I don't even know if this is what I meant or if it came out right, I just need to vent and since no one reads this anywyas, this is a good place to vent to..okay STILL not making sense lol, i'm gonna go sleep now or something..."Why don't you get it together? Failure's not flattering..Can't you see it and you've gone and blown it like everyone thought you would..Show yourself"-nfg

      This might be a long post because I've been thinking but it also may be short cuz my mom is nagging on me to sleep since I have to wake up at 7 am tomorrow. Well school was long, I don't even care for it anymore. It's sad in a way, I used to be so caught up in it but what for? ya it's going to help me with my life but without a heart or anyone there with me for the journey, what good is it really for? So ya school sucked. Afterschool was heartbreaking as usual. Then I had to go to work. It was okay, a good distraction for my mind. Then since I was closing I was there alone and like around 10ish an Indian dad and daughter come in and he's arguing with me about giving him free pizza for his daughter but this guy is wearing a gold necklace with a rolex and he's telling me and my manager he doesn't have 5 dollars for his starving daughter. It was so clear he was scamming and my manager got mad after he left but for some reson, I was still feeling bad for him. He's being selfish and not thinking of his daughter cuz when I looked in his daughter's eyes I was bout 2 cry but he couldn't see that. I felt bad for him. I wish he could fix himself before it's too late. Then I go home and as soon as she opens her mouth, my mom's aggravating me already. I don't yell or show signs of it but she's yelling at me for the stupidest things like the sweater, me sleeping, etc..and I'm probably aggravated because she's SO bitter about screwing things up with her life yet she's too stubborn to 'fess up and say she's wrong and change, everything is always mine and tim's fault and we have 2 just put up with it cuz she thinks she's not selfish but in a way, she definitely is. And I'm aggravated because I see that that is who I am/was. I do not want to be that. As much as I love her because she's my mom, she is the last person I want to be like. She still hasn't realized what's wrong with her but I've at least realized there IS something wrong with me and am trying to fix it. I don't even want to go out with random people anymore or be fake like she is at work parties, I just want to be able to change and be happy with myself cuz (and kevin's going to hate me for saying this) but I'm not happy with what I've done to myself and everyone I love. Speaking of kev kev, I gotta sign that kid's yearbook still like 3 pgs and get his money for saves the day concert hehe he's great. Well my mom's bitching, bye... "i never really wanted you to see this side of me" *crossfade

      Today was long. I've cried a lot during school and afterschool. Thank god for work, it sounds stupid but at least it keeps me from thinking too much..I worked today and I work tomorrow and saturday. I also have to wake up at 7 am on Saturday. Okay so I get home and just got out of the shower and all of a sudden I hear my mom yelling at the TOP of her lungs at tim, like straight out screaming and cursing at him, because of cereal and he's standing there taking it all..and all I can think is how immature and selfish that is of her...then it hit me, that's me. That's who I've been my whole life and it's taken me 16 years to realize it..like yes, I've lost a lot of people in my life that don't get me wrong I've cared about but maybe it's because I'm growing or maybe it's because I love those people I just lost more than anyone I thought I could love or maybe because it's so obvious and blunt that it was all my fault..for whatever reason, this has changed me. I see now how ugly I really am and I want to change. I don't/can't run away anymore. For once, I've never been more alone in my life but then again I"ve never been more ashamed of myself. I came up with a quote I like "If I could, I'd walk back to my past and change it all because I'm dying in this present and I don't want to see the darkness of my future". My mom's getting me into the RecPlexx gym so I can work out 24/7 cuz she's like 'wut else r u gonna do this summer' and she's right I guess, it's not going to be anyhint like last summer so I might as well shape up. Well I'm going to go..bye..here's a good nfg lyric.. "I'd kill to fall asleep"

      "but now i have to crawl to get anywhere at all" *bright eyes "and you don't know the 1/2 of it but i'm the one to blame for it cuz i'm best known for failing, best known for giving up" *new found glory "this is my national cry ya i made mistakes i screwed up this is my way of fixing it*rw  Today was a long day at school, just trying to keep a smile on my face like I've been trying for the last 3 days or so. It all fell apart today though. Lunch was hard as usual. 8th is when things started falling apart again. Something that me and Ana were talking about in study reminded me of k and I got all upset cuz it reminded me of a good memory and I had to hold tears back. Afterschool I went by my locker and r went by me for like 2 seconds and I tried to be really nice because I want him to realize that I am making an effort to change but then he left and I called him and asked if I could get a ride so I could spend more time with him and he said no but it was understandable but I was sitting down in the front and the tears just came cuz I was thinking of me and k then of me and r and Dan came by me for a while but then r came so I wiped my eyes off and ya..me and him don't talk anymore, I don't know what to do, I want to prove to him that I've changed but it's like I don't deserve a 2nd chance and maybe I should leave him alone if that's what he wants cuz I don't want to do anymore harm than I"ve already done, it was all my fault and I understand that he probably doesn't want to be friends anymore. Then I walked home to think things out and I come home and I read j's journal and before I read this journal I thought he just needed a break so I gave him his space then I read it. I read my worst flaws written down for me. That's when I lost it. I didn't do anything to say sorry because I thought he wanted a break so that's what I gave him. Everything he said, I guess is right about me and it hurts, hurts so fucking bad. I seriously don't feel like being here, I'm SOO sick of myself. When I lost friends earlier this year, honestly, it didn't hurt as much as all of this is. This changed me and as much as I know this is true, no one is going to believe me after all of this. Honestly, it took this to make me realize and I'm changing. I'm not looking for other people to replace these 3. I can't find anyone to replace them. But I just don't know what to do anymore, I hate myself for who I am...

I tried to keep a positive attitude and just smile but eh I dunno, maybe it's just me p.m.s.ing..I don't know..all I know is I want this feeling to end "My life's disassembled and my self esteem gone, will this feeling ever end" hehe I made that up..okay I got out of school before 8th pd, I'm sorry I left you ana, I still love you most. Jessie, me and her sis went to Kmart so she could get a white t-shirt. Her sis is so cute. Then me and Jessie went to my house.

Then we went to Woodfield, walked around, got fat from eating, felt lonely cuz we are haha and went to Pac Sun..what I think is that nerd, i'm sorry he gave it all up like that it's dumb and i believe in fate so if things r meant 2 happen again it will i'm just so sad u look sad when u think about it.."what's ur problem, ur making the biggest mistake of ur life" anywho who am I 2 give her love advice, i suck at it too.

       I haven't written in like two days, I don't like falling behind so I'll make this short, kinda. Yesterday, I finished 2 paintings then at night I went to Hooters to eat for Mikala's birthday/girl's night thing. Then we went to the mall and met up with 2 of her friends, Isaac and Garell (sp?). Then I came home. Wednesday was the Saves The Day concert with Tom and Ryan. I heard the one Hot Rod Circuit song I've been dying to hear so that was good. Saves The Day was good too, we didn't stay for the whole time but we stayed long enough to hear "Sell my old clothes, I'm off to heaven" and "Certain tragedy" which was amazing. That's about it, I guess. I'm not that confused anymore well I am but I'm taking it one day at a time cuz who knows what's up with this time. I've been wanting to say hi to someone on-line but I don't know when she's on cuz my buddy list is gayness and won't let me add anymore sns and I wrote him an e-mail which he didn't respond to and I think he has someone new. Which hurts, a lot but I prolly deserve it tho&nbsp;so I gotta take life one day at a time no matter how much it hurts. People have it a lot worse than I do somewhere out there. Ana and I had a hilarious conversation yesterday but with srious points. We found out we both feel weird going out like when we go out, even for 2 seconds or 2 hours we think of the stuff we miss and that makes it seem like going out is just being content, not fully happy. Something's missing..but anyways,&nbsp;Kev and I finally had a good talk last night, it made me really really happy :-D cuz we haven't had one like all week (lol). Well, I'm catching up with Liz right now then I gotta get ready so I'll write more tonight hopefully...-Camille-

      I'm really confused like I have no idea what to do right now...my heart's torn..I just wish that..I dont know...this situation would come easy..cuz it feels right but then again, I don't know..argh...maybe I'll figure it out soon..I hope  And it sucks cus like I'm content and I dont want self-pity but I dont know to even describe how I feel at night cuz like it's still bad missing ppl and thinking of ur fuckups in the day but its harder 2 push back the tears at night...  I wanna talk to Kev soon cuz I know he's sad and I feel somewhat the way he does..but we havent really hung out cuz either I'm busy or he's busy with others so =\..  last thing bugging me is my mom's having a really stressful week at work and since her new car won't come til next week [ya im pissed bout that still but o well u cant fix it] so she still has to like give me the car and we have to deal with making plans based around each other then she has to wait up for me and stuff and this is selfish but i can't go out in the day only at night so she has to wait up and get home early for me argggh i feel like an inconvenience 2 her but then agian, i dont wanna be stuck at home..  argh, im gonna go paint then sleep cuz saves the day is 2morrow...

      I went to church at like 12 today then we saw that Park Ridge was having their "taste" fest so we went cuz Tim wanted to see this random local band play. They were okay but not my style, it was like jazz/electronic, weird combo if u ask me. I got a phonecall during their show and I felt bad but w.e. I went home and took a nap, got ready. Then got in a fight with my mom cuz I don't know, it was dumb and kind of pointless but I ended up crying cuz we've gone for awhile w/o fighting so I was sad. She said I was grounded so she took my keys away from me but said I could go out if Tim takes me (that's my mom's weird grounding rules, most of the times she grounds me, she takes me shopping, she's weird like that but i appreciate it and love it now lol) so Tim had to drive me. I went to see Anchorman, oh man, funniest movie ever, well not funniest but pretty darn close. Will Ferell is soo adorkable  ...lyrics in my head... but even the most beautiful of all roses must someday crumble to dust and fade away. It's a certain tragedy. So it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it. The empty space between me and the sunken walls and feeling someone's hand around my neck choking away the life that I have left. And I can finally see that the further I go I'm only treading ground that I don't want to know. I'll probably hang upside down from wooden rafters in my home and look at old photos of you. I miss the warmth of the summer when we we're on our own, but now it's winter and my bones are cold. -saves the day "Look into my eyes you will see what you mean to me...Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for You can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for...Take me as I am take my life I would give it all I would sacrifice Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for I can't help it there's nothin' I want more...There -was- no love like our love There's nowhere unless you're there...Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for I can't help it there's nothin' I want more.."-Bryan Adams "Rumors flew but nobody knew How much she blamed herself. She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath But she never could get drunk enough To get him off her mind."-Brad Paisley

      Tonight was long at work. I had to close but it was a really really slow night yet Barb still wouldn't let me leave early, whatever. My ankles gave in right when I was giving a pizza to a customer so I fell and so did the pizza almost. I got yelled at cuz Geri kept asking for a kiss jsut cuz he gave me a ring [which broke anyways] but I didn't give him a kiss jsut smiled and Bob the owner thought I was flirting w/Geri so I got yelled at when it was the other way around completely like dude not intersted at allll, whatever. It's all good. The job's not as bad as I used to say so I'm not gonna complain, it was just a long night. I came home and watched Secret Window, pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. Not much left to say, gotta sleep early tho cuz I have church in the morning, argh -camille-      *happy anniversary ='\

      Ya today wasn't really all that great, it got me drained. The day was kind of icky. I was supposed 2 go 2 a hotel party w/Sarah but I ended up not going but I'll catch up w/her later. At night, stopped by Nick's then saw "the notebook" and now I'm home... "Stop worrying about what I want or what he wants or what your parents want. What do you want?"-the notebook "Well that's what we do, we fight. You tell me when I am being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you are a pain in the ass. We fight, it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to work at it every single day but I'm willing to do that because I'm crazy for you"-the notebook rL02 (1:10:56 AM): i know what u mean... but after time it hurt less. but it still hurts to this day when i think about her rL02 (1:20:59 AM): it wasnt a game, people fall out of love...it hurts...but it happens. rL02 (1:25:55 AM): look at all these ppl that get divorced, at one point in time they were in love w/ each other,im not saying it does anything.. but it still was love rL02 (1:29:19 AM): love is different for every relationship..some ppl, its forever...

      Today I woke up late so right away I got in sweats and Mikala asked me to have lunch with her,Mike & Anthony. We went to Mr. Beef's to eat, I had mozz stix, yum. We went back to their house or my house w.e (lol) and Anthony showed me and Mikala how to play Texas 'Hold Em poker. I sucked ass but I won one round and I just like the game itself now that I know the rules. After playing, I went next door to my house to get ready and Britta-ny picked me up. We went to the October Fall show in Wheaton with Clay and Rachel in Clay's car following us. October Fall was real good and played their new songs too, the last song they played they played really good. Inept was okay but the other bands werent good. We left right after Inept played, I think Clay got annoyed of me for that :-\ but anyways, even though the show was good and all..I don't think I'd want to go back to Wheaton. We got lost SOOO bad going to and from. I've never been that lost ever in my life but it's okay, no biggie, ew I've been saying that a lot. I didn't sell the spare ticket, oh well, wut can ya do? I don't really care anyways (lol) I'll just pay Tom, no big. So now I'm home talking to Mikey who I haven't talked to in forever, I'm really glad he IM'd me he's a cute kid but I'm REALLY tired, seriously its been so long since I've been this tired, I definitely need sleep..._Camille_  ..."remember when, the music played, you held me, you looked down at me, i smiled up at you, you smiled back, it was magical and a moment nothing can touch; well that moment stil makes me cry even w/just the music playing again"...  ...."What did I do?

      It was an unproductive day cuz I still havent unpacked haha but a pretty good one, I'm not going to complain. Ana called, I called Kev, Jon called for like 2 sec (lol) but it was funny wut he said so it was ok I guess. I called Kev again and I feel bad cuz my blonde self forgot I called on his cell so I was rambling on for like 30 min. so I wasted his minutes. Anyways, I got ready and he picked me up. He didn't know wether to beep, call, or go up 2 the door (lol) he went to the door which was really nice. He's got a van, its cute. We went to Dairy Queen. The french vanilla Moolatte tasted nothing like I wanted, bummer (lol) but it was kool nonetheless cuz me and Kev just talked for like 2 hours outside. I was being goofy for the most part but the last leg of the convo was good, talking about music and his future but I had to cut it short so I could get ready for work. Work was okay, a little slow but at least it gave me time to finish Gossip Girl *good book* even tho the ending was a little bittersweet. Argh, that means I have to actually read Huck Finn and seriously that book sucks I have like 400 more pages and it's been such painful reading. During work, my mom dropped off the car cuz the dumb dealer hasn't called yet w/her car but w.e...I thought it was so           *My smile is an open wound without you* --fall out boy

      Ah tonight ended sour at like 2 in the morning but it was my fault, I was just thinking about things. I'm just really confused and it doesn't help to know he hates me and we dont talk yet Tim misses him so much. Okay but whatever I'm trying really hard to not whine anymore and bring others down or me down so I'm gonna just stop that thing right there. Cuz besides the last part of the night..my day was good good. I woke up kinda early to watch Dawson's Creek as usual but they didn't show it today, made me upset (lol) but whatever I lived. Since it wasn't home I asked my mom to take me to RecPlexx so I could work out but I guess they closed at noon cuz it was still a holiday so I'm just hopefully going to go tomorrow after work. My mom left for Bally's to work out her skinny ass (lol) so I just laid down for a bit till Mik called and came over. We watched TV for a bit then I had to get ready so we just hung out in my room. I'm such a ditz but it's okay she puts up with it. My mom came over and Tim did after awhile and we all went to Woodfield..family shopping day lol. I got 2 shirts and sunglasses but I had to pay for them cuz my mom paid for everything from Cali so now I'm broke but w.e it's all good. We went to eat at Stir Crazy too, I remembered our date there but I pushed back the tears. I got home and went to Mik's then I called Melissa and we decided to go to her house for a bonfire. My mom was a lil grumpy but it's all good, she was just p.m.s.y I still love her so Mik and I went to Melissa's. It was funny watching her start the fire, on a side note, her dog grew up a lot. At like 9:30 I took Mik home but since she's my neighbor I dropped her off on the other side of the dead end so my mom wouldnt know that I wasted all that gas, haha I felt lame as fuck (lol) but it was kool. After that, Melissa and I went to Burger King and went back to her house to catch up on things, oh man funny ass stories I love that girl. Her mom's so nice and funny too. I went home around 10:30 cuz my mom was being weird and I didn't wanna start a fight so I called it an early night. Took a shower, talked 2 Jon 4 a bit, talked 2 jamie r. too and szabo of course but mostly Melissa and Kev...god, they're cracking me up tonight..they made it easier to hide the tears that I had 2 release 2 Kev but I"m okay now...k I'm gonna go now and finish up our convos then go to sleep and start paintinga nd who knows what 2morrow. I was supposed to watch a movie with Art tonight at his house but we never got to make plans and I didnt have enough time since my mom was being mean so I feel mean about that but ya need sleep..write 2morrow, bye bye..._Camille_

      R.I.P. Louie 10-13-87~07-04-02 *love you  "I miss you a little since you've been gone A few little memories keep hangin' on I miss you a little, I guess you could say A little too much, a little too often A little more every day"-John Montgomery  "Life ain't always what it seem to be Words can't express what you mean to me Even though you're gone, we still a team In the future, can't wait to see If you open up the gates for me Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend Try to black it out, but it plays again When it's real, feelings hard to conceal Can't imagine all the pain I feel Give anything to hear half your breath I know you still living your life, after death Every step I take, every move I make Every single day, every time I pray I'll be missing you Thinkin of the day, when you went away What a life to take, what a bond to break I'll be missing you"-Sting/Sean William Combs  I'm back in good ol' Des Plaines. The trip back took 8 hours no joke. We got delayed in a Phoenix Airport for 7 hours because the weather was too bad but we found out later on like 6 other airplanes went out to Chicago and the Midwest area while we were waiting so that was just dumb but I guess it was kinda ok cuz I got to spend 7 hours with my mom and it was kinda nice then when we finally got on the plane, they had to take the plane back to the gate because the engine wouldn't start and they took some black guy off the plane cuz he was a threat or w.e. then after what seemed forever, the engine finally started although it made a really weird sound but I was just glad it finally got going. We got home at 1:40 in the morning, Tim wasn't so happy about it. We told him all the details about the trip and all he could talk about was work, his time with Mike and their trip to Menards while there was a storm out. I loved his story except he wondered why I teared at one part of it but ya. The trip itself was great, the beginning was hard but after a lot of time thinking by the ocean and at the beach and of course being with my wonderful grandparents, I got myself happy cuz I realize I've lost most of the people I ever love (but thank god manged to keep some with me now thank god so much for that) but the ones I did lose, I lost due to my selfishness and self-pity so I need to suck it up and at the very least, learn from it. "i need 2 make mistakes just 2 learn who I am"-i think that quote is pretty fitting..but ya I can't ruin their lives anymore by talking about it so much and indirectly nagging them...although I still sleep with the picture frame of us in our dresses, sleep with his sweater and his bears, and wear his pink bracelet...I can't go on indirectly holding them back with my self-pity..I have to just try and go on,one breath at a time. Okay enough about that because there is a lot more to say about it but I will just end it with this: I love you, I miss you, I'm sorry. Tim told me when my mom and I got back that there was something different about me that he couldn't pinpoint but i definitely changed, that's the best compliment he's ever given me and I don't think he even knew it.  Today was July 4th. Ana called me when I got up at like 1 so I started getting ready and went to her house. I hung out at her house for a bit and we were gonna go to Sugar Bowl but we didn't have much time so we just went to Burger King. After that, we went to Dominick's to get Louie his flowers. I got a text from Art when we got to Dominick's, it was a nice text just asking where i've been and wut's up. Anyways, we decided to get him a dozen white roses but we wanted to get him a balloon too. All the balloons were like 'happy birthday' and 'get well soon' so I was getting annoyed til I saw a red balloon that said 'i love you'. I showed that one to Ana because that was one of the balloons he got me and I was gonna tell her it was pretty, I didn't get to tell her that he got it for me cuz all she could say was that it was pretty (lol). We wanted to get Lou an 'i miss you' ballloon but 'i love you' was very suiting too. We got in the car and Christy Beers and Ashley was parked next to me so I said hi then we drove to the Shell Station to visit Louie's corner. I decided that we should write in the back of the balloon so we did and Louie: I swear to God we didn't mean 2 sound suicidal lol we just miss you. Okay the visit was fine and all..just looking at his picture and remembering all the memories. God, in two years nothing has changed. I miss him now as I did then, the only thing different is how much we've grown up from this experience. In a way, whoever had to go through it had to grow up too early, even b4 high school, and wether we liked it or not, we faced a hard time in our life and Louie: god you'll never be forgotten. I'll never forget after an assembly in Chippewa you sppinning me around saying "Who's your best friend Camille" and so many other memories..I love you. While we were there, this white Honda pulled up to the Gas Station and parked there and just fucking stared at us. It was really scary but luckily Jorge came just in time. His car is nice, you're lucky Ana (lol). Ana walked me to my car so the white car wouldn't follow me and she got so scared for me, she made me write Jorge's cell # down to call her in case they were following me cuz her cell was dead! That was soo sweet and loving of her   After my little trip with Ana, I went back home then went to church with mom and Tim. We got home and Mik called right away crying :'( I told her to come over right away and she was explaining to me her fight with her dad. It was horrible I offered her all of my Kleenex and hugs. It was hard I didn't wanna intrude cuz Mike (her dad) is my neighbor but Mik's such a great girl and is a friend so of course I knew even tho he was my neighbor, Mik came first and I wanted to take her from her pain and I really did try but Mike wouldn't let her go anywhere. We were gonna go to the Elk Grove fireshows but he wouldn't let her. I wanted her to just spend the night but he wouldn't let her. My mom, Tim, and I ended up going to a Mount Prospect carnival to watch **fireworks** but she couldn't come and I was bummed out cuz I knew she was so sad but nonetheless, the fireworks were amazing. They were so big and pretty, even when they fall down, they're still pretty, I liked them a lot. Mik: I hope you feel better, I'm here for you just one house away. I wanted to call Kev tonight after the fireworks show to catch up and what not but it was too late when I got home so I still miss him. Tomorrow, I'm working out at RecPlexx in the morning (cuz I got super fat from eating non-stop my grandparents "philipino" food (lol)) then I'm painting (Lolo (my grandpa) got me so many new brushes, a bunch of little 5x7 canvas and lots of paint so that was fucking great) and I'm starting my first painting tomorrow. After that, who knows, I can't predict the future so I'm just gonna take a shower at 1 in the morning and go to sleep with my t.v. blasting..that right there, is independence haha, happy fireworks day   "...I tried not to hurt you but I did...Is that why they say...Every rose has its thorn, every cowboy sings a sad sad song..."-Poison
