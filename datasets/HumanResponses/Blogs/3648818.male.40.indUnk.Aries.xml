      Well, on more than one occasion today I looked at my pint and it was half empty! But that's not the point I'm trying to make here. when I got back from watching the match and bowling (badly) I listened to Five Live's 6:06 and heard many relieved but unhappy fans sounding off about England's performance today. In case anyone forgot - WE WON!!  OK so it wasn't that convincing and no-one should be decieved by the 3:0 score but after the daylight robbery of Sunday's game I'd have settled for a scruffy 1:0 win with the goal being scored off Ashley Cole's backside! A win is a win and more than that, France avoided defeat by the mighty(?) Croatians! (more about them on Monday)  France must be the luckiest team on earth!  As for Sven's men, the glass is definitely half full and things can only get better from here on. I'm off to the country for the weekend so more Euro2004 blog and other stuff in a couple of days.  Bye for now.

      With just 2hrs to go before the big kick-off I'm beginning to get just a little nervous! Even superheros like me are powerless to help the lads once they cross the white line! But why should we fear the Swiss? A nation famous for neutrality, cuckoo-clocks, cheese (mmmmmmmmmmmmm), chocolate (mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm), and pocket knives! Hopefully they will do the decent thing and let us win, somebody has to lose to the Germans on penalties later in the competition and it might as well be us (already the long spectre of such an event hangs over every day. More blog later......( 3:10pm)

      At long last the deal is done and the man from Valencia has signed as Liverpool's new manager! No news yet on whether he'll be bringing a bagfull of players with him but stay tuned for further updates! Maybe now a new era of supremacy for the Mighty Reds is about to begin!!   Dangermouse  It would appear that the brilliant animated character is seen by some to be a gay icon (nothing new there then, who isn't these days!). Anyone viewing this site in the hope of finding anything of a gay nature will be very disappointed - try somewhere else!

      Well hello to anyone out there reading this! Thought I'd have a go at my own 'blog' but it's taken so long to set up it's now very late and I need sleep! In future I hope to be a little more inspiring but for now I'd like to thank my mate 'Sven' for the idea. Goodnight all, stay posted for further news!
