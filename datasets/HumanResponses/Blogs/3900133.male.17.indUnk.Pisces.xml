      I didn't realise how much I actually missed dancing at AnArchy&nbsp;until I danced last night in the club Mitchel works at. Yeah, I met up with him again. I was trying to work but I'd been on the streets for hours with nothing to do so when I (literally) ran into him (ow)&nbsp;I thought I might as well tag along. He's a dancer there too and since his partner wasn't there I got to take his place. I woulda been willing to dance the night away but I'm still not well and I think I overdid it a bit. So then I fell asleep in the dancer's lounge while he finished his shift. He's so gods damned nice to me, no one but Lucious has ever actually cared... well, there have been a few but... you know. My rule. So yeah, by the time he was done so were most of the other dancers and we were about the only ones left after a while. So I gave him a kiss ^^ Yeah, I probably shouldn't have, I mean, I don't want him to think it means anything. He's not the first person I've given a kiss and nothing more. I also learned something not entirely pleasant but important about him; he has AIDS. Looks like I won't be jumping into bed with this pretty boy anytime soon. Actually, with all the unprotected sex I have I'm surprised I haven't come down with something like that. Right, better be off home. I bought myself a new cd, so I can listen to that while I walk.

      So why didn't I post yesterday? I'll tell you. I passed out on the street, that's why. I'd gone to get more stuff from the shops (including painkillers) and I guess the fever I have got a bit too much for me, so my body gave it up and I passed out on the street. That was the bad thing. Now when I woke up, however, I certainly wasn't on hard asphalt anymore, but in a bed. I panicked and hoped I wasn't in a hospital; which it turned out not to be anyway, and there was this guy sitting beside me, obviously waiting for me to wake up. I've never been looked after in the manner that he did it; locking me in the room until I finally went to sleep. Can you believe that? He locked me in the fucking room and escaped out the window!! Who the fuck does that?! Anyway... the guy's name is Mitchel, he's nice enough I suppose, says he sometimes does the same thing I do. He looks cool, anyway, his hair's black in front and neon green in the back ^^ awesome. But anyway, obviously I'm out of that room now, and&nbsp;I did thank him for helping me, if you want to know. He musta carried me all the way to the hospice. Brought my shopping too. Nice guy. Wonder if I'll see him again?

      Well… happy birthday, Alexi. For whatever it’s worth. He doesn’t even read this journal, I know it, but I just wanted to show that I hadn’t forgotten it. I wonder how he’s going and if he’s having fun… I wonder if Lucious is looking after him and cheering him up. I hope they’re happy.

      I'm debating with myself about getting another piercing. I wouldn't have a clue as to where though and it would take my total up to... lesseeeee.... twenty six. If I got another piercing I would have  twenty-six  piercings. I didn't actually realise I had that many; nine in my left ear, six in my right, two in my left eyebrow, one in my right, one through my lip, one through my tongue, both nipples pierced, belly-button, and one stud through the webbing between thumb and forefinger of each hand. Maybe my 25th could be my nose. Or not. I've never liked nose rings. I'm just trying to distract myself again, I suppose, but I really would like some more body art... perhaps another tattoo. It took so much convincing to get the guy who did the rose and dagger one on my back to do it, he thought I was too young and stupid to know what I wanted. Men are so easily convinced though, heheh. I even got a discount. It was even harder to get the one on my cheek. Another tattoo... I like the sound of that now. I might think on that, although I have no idea on what I might want or where I'd want it. We'll see.

      And it's getting worse. I'm not gonna go see a doctor though, not until I'm really desperate. For now these over-the-counter painkillers will do. Mmm, painkillers. I've gotta have the broken glass in the shower cubicle replaced, which is gonna cost a fucking fortune. Gods it was stupid of me to do that. Also, I have to check the newspaper for apartments for rent. I can't stay here now, I'm gonna get worried people at my door the whole time asking me if I'm ok. If Ritze knows my address, half the boys at AnArchy are gonna know it too after a while. And I recently remembered, and then confirmed,&nbsp;that coming Sunday is Alexi's birthday. Well fuck, now what? I can't ring him because a) My phone doesn't work and b) I tore up his number. And I don't know where they live, either. So I guess this year, the first year I'm actually aware of my brother's birthday, I'm not gonna be able to do anything for it. I really can be a fucking moron, can't I? I have to go shopping again later to get more meds and food, although I'm hardly eating anything now and I'm really not in the mood to move. Hopefully I won't have to take long in doing it.

      Of all the things that could happen... it seems Lucious has a blog too. Well, sort of, he has a livejournal. Casein found it because he has one of his own and was browing the members and of  all  the people he found  urlLink Lucious , and sent me an email with the link. I just can't get over it. I also can't get over how Lucious is beating himself up over this. I can't believe how much he hates himself for my pain. And I realise that I've hurt him, and very badly too. Why couldn't he just have stayed at home? Then I wouldn't have done all those things to scare him so badly! I found their phone number beside my non-working phone and tore it up again without actually realising what I was doing, because no matter how upset I make them, I want them to stay away and leave me alone. I want no contact with them. Maybe if I ignore them and push them away long enough they'll take a hint and stay away. As for Ritze... I have nothing to say to him anymore. He betrayed me, he told Alexi how to find me. If he hadn't done that, none of this shit would have happened. I can't believe I trusted him.

      It's almost unbelievable how things turn out. I just don't believe so many things could have happened at once, not this way, not this fast. I've just escaped from hospital, it was seriously like a breakout, I told them&nbsp;I was&nbsp;going to the toilet.  I suppose I should say what happened, although I don't really want to relive it. In the end sending AnArchy a cheque was a bad idea after all. It seems Ritze traced the cheque back through the bank and managed to find my new address. He's always been good at extracting information, even from people like bank tellers who should be keeping that sort of information to themselves. I never thought he'd tell Alexi though, I can't believe it.  It was a shock when Alexi showed up on my doorstep. He wanted to 'talk', can you believe it? The thing I wanted was&nbsp;for my brother to go,&nbsp;and I tried to send him away. He was intent on trying to help me, saying I looked sick. I must have, I feel like shit. I even collapsed in the bathroom before, which brings me to the next part of my story. I collapsed and I think I hit my head hard on the floor, because when I finally woke up it was on my bed with Lucious by my side. Well, you can imaine that he was the last person I wanted to see, after I sort of got my heart broken by him, but he refused to leave. He was also doing the 'areyouok' thing.  So hell, I took my chance.  I kissed him.  Of course, that probably made it worse, but I had to give it a go. He didn't return it and tried to be tolerant. Tried? Lucious is so tolerant it's frustrating. So I locked myself in the bathroom and stuck my head under a cold shower to try and make me feel better while he said consoling things from the other side of the door. Him trying to make me feel better actually made me feel worse, and that was when, I admit, I did something stupid. I smashed the shower cubicle's glass panelling. There was glass every-fucking-where and I hurt myself quite badly, bleeding everywhere. Lucious panicked, I think he thought I was gonna slit my wrists or something. I seriously considered it too, I have realised since all of this started that I do need to rely on people, and I hate it. I fell silent, and Lucious panicked even further. He called an ambulance, and although I managed to get out of the house they found me. I musta looked like some fucking junkie; pale, gaunt, shadows under my eyes, bleeding and soaking wet. Not to mention in one of my slutty outfits.  So I was brought to hospital. And I escaped. I'm surprised they didn't bring me straight to a councillor or at least the cops.&nbsp;Now I want to move  again  because now they can find me. Am I going to spend the rest of my life running from the people who try to help me? It's probably going to be that way. I don't need help.  I feel awful now, my stomach hurts real bad and I barely made it home. After sleeping I came here and got my now frequent coffee and hour on the internet. How much longer until I have a mental breakdown?

      Shit... I could barely get out of bed this morning, I felt so gods damned sick... I tried to force some soup down my throat and it came right back up again. I fucking  hate  that. Ergh... I don't even know why I'm  here , I got nothing to say! I guess this is my little distraction from the real world, from my predicament. I'm an idiot, I realise that now. Did get another customer though! Some slob with money to spare. It was pretty bad, but I've had worse. I used that money, the money from Calic and drew some more from my account and sent a thousand dollar cheque to AnArchy. Hopefully Ritze will know who needs it most. I was careful not to include a return address on the envelope because I just  know  they'd come looking for me. And I wasn't gonna rely on anyone anymore, remember? Mind you, that's pretty stupid since I've always relied on random strangers for my income, haha... I miss being scolded by Alexi. I never thought that'd happen. Shiiit, now I'm getting cramps again. I really hope it's nothing serious because that means hospitals and hospitals ask questions. Prostitution is still illegal, apparently. Hey lookit, I guess I did have stuff to say...

      Ahh, I've run into problems again... the problems of finding someone and having to break their heart. One thing I learnt on the streets; Love is very difficult, and it hurts. I got a customer by the name of Calic. He could afford me, and paid up front. But I knew something was wrong as soon as I realised how gently he was treating me... I'm a masochist and I'm in the market for pain. I told him his four hundred would get him whatever he wanted for a night but he did it as if he was doing me a favour, gently. Later on I managed to get him to admit he had feelings for me. I'd known this guy, what, two hours? Gods, he blushed every time I mentioned it! Poor guy... he kept wanting to know why it was so bad that he had these feelings for me and I had to completely shoot him down. I have the rule that I would never get into a relationship with anyone who pays for me, and I wasn't about to break it for a stranger. I could tell he was genuinely upset, but hey, am I wrong? Was it wrong of me? He was truly kind to me though, no one has done that since the three back home; Alexi, Lucious and Goast. Gods dammit, I called it home. I've gotta drill it into my head that  this  is home to me now. This place. No matter how much I liked the other place. I feel worse than last time, barely ate anything again. In away that's good, I suppose, less money spent on food, haha... I wish I could apologise to Calic. I can't find the words.

      ...can it? Oh yeah, yeah it can. I don't think this place is too good for my health... I haven't felt well since this morning. But it's nothing too drastic, I can deal with it, my stomach just feels a bit... off. I haven't eaten anything last night either, both because I don't feel well and because I'm not hungry. The air in this place is probably what's making me sick. Before all the ordeals that got me here I wouldn't have even thought of moving into this side of town, and now I know why. I did my first set of shopping today, wearing my longcoat again that Alexi gave me. I love that coat. The closest shops around here that sell what can at least pass as food is a couple of blocks away, so I walk. My expensive gothic style clothing is so out of place here, but at least it's the right colour. I swear to the gods this place is always dark. I have to admit now that I'm miserable. And alone. I admit now that I do need Alexi, and Lucious, and Ritze. And the boys at the club need me. I haven't earned any money to send them yet, in fact, for the first time in years I've taken money from the bank account my parents put my allowance into, even though I swore I wouldn't touch that money because I want nothing to do with them. But without it, I wouldn't have been able to feed myself, and it's amazing the amount of cash that's built up in there over the years. So why don't I rent a better apartment? Because I've learnt from past experiences that if you get comfortable and confident with money, that soon all that money will be gone.

      This is the first time in a long time that I've been alone for twenty-four hours in a row. Aside from the kinda nice man who works here in the 'net cafe I haven't spoken to anyone. I never thought I'd be lonely, not in my line of work, but after only such a short time to I realise how much I need another person's attention to feel good. To feel safe... I seem to be sinking deeper into self pity, and I need to find something to distract myself from it, either a customer or something else... the little apartment I have is so bare and dull, there's nothing there for me except my comics and shit. But I gotta resist the urge to call Ritze for advice. I shouldn't have to rely on anyone. I've done that for too long.

      Here I am spending some of the little cash I have in the internet cafe again. This is the second time today. At least you get coffee with it, even if it doesn't taste too good. Today I explored this shithole of a place I'm living in. Not the apartment, I mean the neighbourhood. I didn't wear my usual outrageous clothing because for once I didn't want to be noticed. The whole place stinks, I think there's gotta be a factory nearby because it always seems dark. The word 'slums' comes to mind. No wonder my apartment was ultra cheap. The type of people around here aren't exactly pleasant either. I didn't even need to talk to them to figure that out. But I'm sure a lot of guys here are willing to pay for my services, they all look fucking desperate. I don't want to be here, I realise that now, but I also don't want to go back. I don't want to need other people's help anymore...

      I suppose I started this thing because I wanted to distract myself from the horrible mess I've gotten myself into. I'm in a part of town I've never visited before, in one of the cheapest internet cafe's I could find. At least I'm away from the little bare apartment I'm renting now... I'm such an idiot, this whole thing is my fault but I'm sure moving away from home and not letting my brother and his boyfriend know where was probably the best thing to do. This way Alexi won't constantly be trying to change my mind or whatever and he won't constantly nag me. And this way I won't have to face Lucious again, who knows now how I feel about him. I should never have told him. I can't believe I did. And he apologised, fuck he  apologised ! Apologised for not sharing those feelings. Way to go to make me feel worse... I don't think I ever want to see Alexi or Lucious again. One thing I feel a little bad about is that I've left the boys at AnArchy nightclub. They need me, and I'm not there for them. Mind you, I'm still gonna work, and I'll try and send them a cheque whenever I can. They've never been able to look after themselves... and then there's Goast. He was upset when I told him I was leaving. But hell, I couldn't take him with me, could I? I just don't know anymore... I'm tired, and my hour here is almost over, so I'd better go.

      Gods, I haven't updated this in over a week... but maybe that's because I've been distracted by other things. For example, I've been dancing almost every night at the gay club Mitchel works at now, and I love it there. It's like AnArchy, but with older boys ;D and there was actually quite an unpleasant surprise for me there; turns out the dancing partner I replaced is actually someone I know. Jordyn, that dreadlocked asshole that hates me about as much as I hate him. Damn. Talk about a downside. It was damn funny though cos apparently Mitchel is like his best friend and it absolutely  killed  him to see me with him. Score to me. However.... At one point we were in the park again, he'd actually found me asleep under the tree, and everything was going perfect, we get along so well and I told him about my ultimate obsession, The Crow comic books and then BAM, it started to rain. Thunder and lightning and all that shit. It was so sudden, sunlight at one point, then rain outta nowhere. So we made a dash for it to his apartment, which was closest. So we're good at this point, but... Now of course I was thinking this was the time when I could score (the fact he had AIDS didn't bother me in the slightest) and we actually did get pretty close, until... gods, I can't even remember what was said or done but we had a disagreement and it all stopped, so I was moping on the couch for a while as he went to have a shower. Try two; I follow him into the bathroom and surprise him in the shower, and he certainly didn't mind... *grin* have I mentioned he's a great kisser? And  shit , he has a hot body. We were all ready to get right into it when I made the mistake of saying we should probably get out of the shower first. If we'd stayed in the shower it might have worked, but although everything was going well for a while I soon opened my big mouth and said something he took in the wrong context and he got annoyed with me. Fuck!! >. I ended up leaving, saying it was all a bad idea and walking home for half an hour in the rain. I think I have a cold. I kinda... I dunno... I guess I miss him a bit. Maybe I'll go dance at the club again, I know I'll see him there. I do like him. I wonder if he really likes me...

      …I think. It's not really official or anything, but it sure as shit isn't 'friends' anymore. I can’t believe it; it’s still kinda sinking in. When I was coming home after my last post, listening to my Moi Dix Mois CD, I saw Mitchel again across the street and went to talk to him. He said he was on his way to work so I was about to leave him to it when he practically grabbed me and asked me what plans I had for the day ^^ w00t. I told him not much and so we ended up going to lunch at a Thai place together, him buying. Warm fuzzy feeling, anyone? I dunno why, he just makes me feel comfortable, probably because he treats me like a person instead of like a whore; he’s friendly to me and he seems to care… and he has problems too. I told him so much about myself, more than I’ve told anyone before except my brother. I just… I dunno… speak so easily with him. After lunch we went wandering for a while and ended up in a park, where we left one another. I didn’t want to leave but… well, he did and I wasn’t going to chase him down like some obsessed little fanboy. I saw him the following day though and that’s when things changed. I was at that park again and saw him go by, so I stopped to say hello. We ended up on the playground, fooling around on the slide and after a little accident we ended up in a tangle at the bottom of the slide. I thought it was really funny actually, as it seemed like a game… until he kissed me. Well shit, was I gonna pass up that opportunity? Hell no, I kissed him right back. So he’s seven and a half years older than me, big deal! He’s sexy and nice and I think he’s great. Why fight it? And whoooo… a good kisser too. I was on cloud nine at that point and although when he pulled back he seemed a little nervous and shy (how cute) he didn’t get off me for quite some time. Then we kinda realised we were in a public place and got up, heh, and I went to help him with shopping. After that little incident he wasn’t shy anymore and I was pleased as all hell, let me tell you. He’s not like any of my other admirers who have all at some point paid for sex with me and my unwritten rule states that if you’ve paid for me you’ll never get serious with me. Because Mitchel has AIDS we haven’t slept together and so my rule doesn’t go for him. I can’t even begin to tell you how happy that makes me. Maybe he’ll be the one who helps me forget Lucious.
