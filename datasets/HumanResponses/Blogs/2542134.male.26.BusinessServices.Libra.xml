       It seems that 100mg of L5 Hydroxytryptophan did the trick, I feel much better now.  This only proves that Ripped Fuel is indeed affecting my seratonin levels.  I'm going to decrease the dosage to one capsule instead of two.  *Hit gym for cardio after everything is packed.

       It's been 2 hours since the work out and I still feel like shit.  I'm depressed, and irritable, but I don't understand what is causing this.  I'm sure its some kind of chemical imbalance.  I just need to firgure out whats causing this.  *Regardless of how I feel, do complete the cardio set today.

       So I had to cut short of my workout, I was at least able to complete my weights workout though.  I haven't been feeling to well since yesterday workout after I came back from Iowa.  I don't know what's causing this since I really didn't change anything except for the "rest" day in between.  Anyhow, I puked right after the workout.  Felt really dizzy through the weight lifting routine. I also feel a bit depressed.  That's too odd, my guess is that the cocoa from the Ripped Fuel is depleting my seratonin, or it could be something else, but chocolate release seratonin, that's why a lot of people inadvertently eat chocolate when they feel depressed.  This is just a guess, but that could explain why I'm a bit depressed.  *Note to self, research possible connection between cocoa and seratonin. *Hit gym again later on to finish with the cardio. *Completed 3 sets of 10 for each muscle. *Took 40g of protein from whey.

       It seems that working out all the muscles every day and twice a day was having minimal effects on muscle growth, regardless of how much effort I was putting in.  This time I will try to work all muscles but give it one day rest for the muscles to regenerate.  I will still keep taking 2 capsules of Creatine Fuel and Ripped Fuel Extreme Cut(ephedra free) each.  And I will take 40g of protein from whey after each work out.  On the "rest" days I will only engage in cardio workout, probably 40 minutes to one hour.  Today I will work out all muscles followed by 20-40 minutes of cardio.  Current weight: 165 pounds*  *No meal taken yet.  * On a personal reflection, I really hate to be so freaking superficial, but what choice do I have?

						   Ok so I got back home like  10am in the morning.  Had to go to work at 1pm. The thing about yesterday is that, well me and JC went to Five, then I met the girl, that well, I just didn't want to.  After the NYC stuff I was really fed up with her, I got hurt so like I built this wall around myself.  So I thought, ok I'll just ignore, and pretend I didn't see her.  Didn't matter though, she flew right at me, better yet, she jumps on me, and starts kissing me, no hi or nothing? At the momemnt my mind was telling me, to stop kissing her back and make a stand, but well my lips just let it follow hers.  After she tells me how she missed me and all.  I'm thinking to myself, well has she forgotten what happened in NYC?  I'm still bitter, but when she started kissing me, I just let it go... I know I will regret in a couple of days....  Busy night. Er morning.

						   Ok after staying up late just so I could be able to chat with Ellie, left me with only couple of hours of sleep, bleahaaeeh.  The whole day at work was praying it would just fly by.  Wasn't as smooth as I wanted it to be, but it was alright, nothing compared to "those" hell days at CompUSSR.  What I find funny is that, when I give the customer a hand, they frecking want the whole arm, when I give them a hand but I refuse to give my whole arm, they complain that I have a bad attitude.  That's just great!  The wonders of retail! Bleeeaaah.  I need to get the hell out of here sometime.  I need to go teach by broken English in Japan.  All I need is to do is my citizenship, and I'm good to go.  So once I land in Japan I want to like enroll to an ninja dojo, and buy like ninja stars and stuff.  Eugene would be so jealous.  hahaha  Anyways, I'm not planning to do much to this blog, since I'm playing to get a webhosting next month and like reado it all over again anyways, but this time hopefully it will transfer correctly.  So, bleah.  I'm tired, however James is picking me up in 2 minutes to have dinner, then I have to go to DC to meet up with Eugene and Aimee for drinks and stuff... and more!  haha

						   Christ, so I decide to transfer over my blog to my verizon hosting so I could use this diferent template I download.  So I go ahead and delete this copy only to find out that the transfer did not occur?!@?   Fregging three months of blogging down the drain and I don't even have a back up copy. :(  Oh well,  I guess I'll start over..  Add some new pics when I get my camera working...  This sucks!

						   Ok I guess the previous night was rougher than I thought.  I'm basically fully awake only now.  Had some people call me ealier, but I really do not remember what I told them on the phone, I was probably incoherent to them :(.  I know Eugene called me from the airport because I think I was supposed to meet before he left.  My boss also called me, I don't know if it was regarding work or somthing else.  Anyways, sorry...  Probably I made no sense.  Its just funny that I "always pretend" that I'm awake or try to pass on that its no big deal that they woke me up with their calls in an lame attempt to make them feel confortable.  It's really no big deal, but because I pretend, I always end up saying some incoherent stuff... and probably they feel more unconfortable as is :P

						   Ugh, good morning.  After dinner, I went to Alan's place, then we headed out to Cafe Citron, but I left the boys there, and bounced to 18th street lounge to meet up with uh..    urlLink    You know who...(Damn asian glow around my eyes)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    What was going on here?&nbsp; urlLink     Yawn, back to bed...

						   So I wake up at 9am to a phone call from my other boss.  Nice way to start the day off eh?  Ok so Eugene can't drive because he broke his ankle.  I drive to his place, leave my car there, pick him up and his car and drive to middle of nowhere in Fairfax, some government building.  I was to meet my boss to finalize the loan/sale of the car.  The guys working on the loan, suddenly decide to go to lunch and my boss runs out of time, since he works at 1pm.  Ok so my boss has his wife take care of the loan and his current car.  Since he is buying, we tell him to drive the car to get used to it, since the car is low as hell.  So he drive us to Eugene's and drop us off there, before he heads out to work.  Ok Eugene says Misha was coming over so we decide to all have lunch together.  I'm ready to go home, but nooooo, I have to drive to truck rental drop Eugene and Leavan, then  I have to help him move two sofas, one bed and some other stuff to the truck.... great, heheh.  Tomorrow I have to go to Eugene's to pick up the four original suspension, and some other car parts.  UGH.  He conviniently broke his ankle when he has to move out. hahaha  Basically today was the last day for Eugene's apt, since he doesn't have any furniture in there he will be staying at Leavan's.  Good times/memories from Eugene's apt.   urlLink    Eugene's BBQ area.  Good memories!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    "Our table"&nbsp; urlLink

						   So I'm playing around with the new camera, and I have to say it got some cool features.  The flashless Night Shot (Nightsight; pitch dark, no light , no flash shot.)  urlLink    Booze&nbsp; urlLink      Or ultra sharp Macro Shot (shooting pictures very close)  urlLink    $50 bill&nbsp; urlLink

						   So I was supposed to meet up with her today, but alas, I'm broke.  She called me ealier and asked to meet her at Cafe Asia for drinks.  I told her that, uh, Steve was here, so I had to wait for him to come back, since I'm being the host and all (Thinking about it, that excuse was really bad, and might have sounded gay).  Well, huh, I didn't go to Cafe Asia nor called her.... Because, someone very dear to me might get mad at me, and also because, uh  this could just turn to a big trouble later on. Very tempting though.  HELP!!! HELP!!!

						   So the extended warranty refused to repair the camera, and told the store to just refund. GRRRR.  I really like the big Carl Zeiss lens, and have been really looking foward to get one with it.  So my other option was to get the refund, add more money on it and buy the newest F series, which has a retail value of $699.  Well, all I can say I'm pretty much broke, but I'm always broke anyways.   urlLink    DSC-F717&nbsp; urlLink      So I took a picture of the lease office with this, and damn, it looks soo much better than that 2.6 megapixels dsc-f505v, 5.0 megapixels really does make a difference.  Plus  the legendary Carl Zeiss lens make everything looks so vivid and clear.   urlLink    Lease Office&nbsp; urlLink     Changing the subject, "the" girl called me a couple of minutes to go out, I'll told her I will give an answer later tonight.  Well I'm broke, and not only that, Dana would get really mad if I did go out with her.  :P

						   I think I mentioned on my ealier entries(before I accidentally deleted the blog)that I came really close quitting my job a couple of times.  I actually did snap one day, and I was actually leaving the building, when one of my coworkers reasoned with me to stay.  It's that stressful.  I mean, have you ever worked any kind of job that you are thinking about quitting every day?  The idea of quitting my job crosses my mind that many time throughout the day.  The reason I can't really quit, is that I need to get another one first.  So a friend of mine told me that one of his acquaintances was looking for someone to manage a net cafe.  He knows how stressed I get at work and he thought it would be a nice temp job until I find something else.  So I was actually thinking on doing that, but I'm thinking that instead of doing that, I could work both.  That would require me to work 80hrs per week though... It gonna be hard, but doable.  My friend himself only sleep 5-6 hour per day.  Yes I won't have a life, but the way I get broke, its not like I'm having much of a life anyways.  Anyways, I'm being the middleman of Macter's sale.  So Eugene was suppose to bring the car today, but he didn't.  My boss thought he was not being serious about the car sale, since he didn't even reply to phone calls and voice mails.  Late I find out he was at the hospital because he broke his ankle playing basketball.  So, I talk to Eugene and they will go with the sale tomorrow.  Steve is here, but I'm barely able to chat with him, because when I get from work, he is sleeping already.  Well there are weekends ahead though.  Danita is sad and I don't want her to be , so I just want to say, BABY JUST GET OVER HERE!  Myself, Eugene, Steve, and Misha are here, so why not come down here for some fun?  You know my invitation is always open, since like 5 years ago when I first met you!  Ellie, update your BLOG!

						   This is hilarious.  So my brother is like, "Steve is downstairs." I'm like wtf, he went back to Illinois last weekend.  So I find out that he came to work here for one month and he will be staying over at my place.  He drove 15 hours from Illinois.  I just don't know how people can drive this far.

						    urlLink    DSC-F505V&nbsp; urlLink    So I was really excited that I received battery charger for my camera today.  I was ready to charge up my camera and just snap bunch of pictures.  Mostly bought it so I can easily upload pics to my blog.  So after taking a couple of pictures, and looking through the computer monitor, I notice a bunch of black dots/particles on the pictures. SIGH!!!!! So I asked my boss what it could be, and he said he could be the camera cpu that needs replacement....  or I think it could be dust particles.  Anyways, it needs to be sent for repairs or maintenance.  It will probably take a month or so.   urlLink    Click on the picture to see a larger image with the dots/particles.&nbsp; urlLink     On a ligther note, my nick at work went from Gooey to Swing...  I guess it had to happen. hahah

						   So I had found a buyer(my boss) for Macter a couple of weeks ago, but Eugene never showed up to show the car and the buyer ended up deciding to use the money for a new house.  Once again, I found another buyer, which happens to be my other boss. He is not just interested, he will buy it as long as they can reach an agreement on price, which I'm 99% sure it will happen.  Funny thing is that after my boss saw the car he was telling Eugene how he was telling his wife that he wanted a car just for "cruising" around. I told him that if he buys this car, he wouldn't be cruising around with his wife, but cruising solo, with loud music on, and honking to the girls walking on the street... He had a laugh. hahah   urlLink    Macter&nbsp; urlLink

						   So I had to stay after work today, for the awards. I was basically requested to show up.  Ok fine.  So I thought I would get something cool like a prize.  I mean, even with all the shit that goes at work, I still work hard.  So as an award I got a *drumroll* A GHETTO plaque, and my name is spelled WRONG.  SWNG.  What the hell is SWNG?        PARK SWNG Operational Excellence.  haha, this company is a joke!   urlLink    "The award".&nbsp; urlLink

						   Hmm, ok, so I call JC and tell him, I'll be heading out to DC to meet up at Spank, as planned.  He says it will be hard to get to Spank and its not a good idea that I should head out today.  Ok that's just freaking weird.  Now, JC knows what happened between me and "the" girl before, as well to what happened yesterday.  He knows it not healthy for me to get together with "her".  My guess is that he is trying to hint that "she" will be there or just trying to protect me...  Oh the drama!  Or maybe he is already getting busy. hahah

						   Eeeh.  So its 12:49Pm Saturday night, I have to work tomorrow at 11AM, but I'm heading out to DC again.  Hopefully "the" girl will not be there again.  It could brew into lot of problems if I keep seeing her again.  Regarding yesterday, maybe the reason my reaction was compliance with her advances was that I was really hammered.  I know I'll be hammered again tonight, thus why I really do not wish to meet her again.

						   Well so I guess I'm hitting Ozio tonight, I mean now.  It's been very long time ago I last been there, I wonder if there were any kind of renovations there.  I used to enjoy it there, since me and the boys used to have the Thursday Guys Night Out, every week.  Anyways, gotta to the Three S.  Kids, behave out there...

						   So I was reading someone elses blog about how people are pricks and bad drivers.  She gives a full account of what happened, and even so, she think others are wrong.  This is a lot common among slow drivers that think they are "good righteous drivers" because they drive slow.  Since when driving slow equates to driving safer or driving better?  Yeah like those 90yrs old people driving a car definately drive REALLY safe because they drive slow.  What equates safety is not the speed, its the skill of the driver, yes there are plenty of Formula 1 racers wanna be out there, not defending them either, it's just that I freaking hate those people that think they are the righteous because they are gullible enough to believe crap fed by self appointed rigtheous yuppies.  Some classic stuff, So this woman does not stop at the "STOP" sign.  And almost crash on side of my car.  She honks at ME?!?  So, of course instead of moving my car, and just pull the hand break and get out of my car to have a little chat with the woman,  because I'm sick a tired of you slow fuckers, rightheous wanna be asses thinking they are right, when clearly you are not!  I want to get to your thick skulls that driving slow does not mean you have no fault on a car accident and shift the blame on who was "faster".  Anyways I aprroched the her car to talk to her, she only lower like half an inch on the window, possibly because she was scared, but she wasn't scared when she was honking wasn't she?  She tells me I crossed the intersection TOO fast.  HELLO McFLY?  There is no stop sign on my side only on YOUR SIDE!@!!#!!#@  Ok so I'm at the middle lane, and there is this woman on my right lane.  We are at the traffic light, waiting the lights to go green.  Lights go green, I take off, the woman beside me, is still right by my side,  the thing is that, her lane will turn into "parallel parking" lane so she has to move in to my lane.  When we were back at the red light, any one could see that the right lane will turn into a dead end.  So basically her choice was, take off faster than me and overtake me or slow down and get behind my car. Of course being the rigtheous slow driver, she will not overtake me, but being the dumbass righteous slow driver, she doesn't slow down, instead, she tries to just "MOVE IN" because supposedly giving the signal equates to "here I come, you have to move the heck out of the way because I signaled, so its my right of way".  I'm not going out of my way to help you slow rigtheous drivers, so screw you, I maitained my speed and didn't even flinch, I kept myself on the middle lane.  She almost crashes on me before moving back to her lane realizing I wouldn't move.  She of course honks at me.  JESUS EITHER SPEED UP AND OVERTAKE ME OR SLOW THE FUCK DOWN AND GET BEHIND MY CAR, IM NOT YOUR MOMMY TO TEACH YOU THE LOGIC OF PHYSICS.  Of course I have to stop the car, block the whole fucking traffic, make a scene, so she GET THE POINT through HER THICK SKULL.  And these self appointed righteous slow fuckers makes a big fuzz about Road Rage.  Road Rage only flourished because of you self appointed righteous slow drivers that think driving slow is being safe.   Well, THE ONLY thing you are doing is going slower than the speed limit, you aren't driving any safer, doing fucked up/unsafe lane changes, fucking up flow of traffic, blocking all the freaking four lanes of the freeway.  That is NOT display of safe driving.  Learn how to freaking drive safer before bitching about it, because driving slow does not equate to safe driver.

						   So like Steve left his cell phone at work, so if the Czech girls called, well too bad.  We missed the opportunity. But they live under the same roof, so there is PLENTY of time.  We went to have dinner then basically hit DC as usual. Wait we went to Cafe Asia first.  Then Guajillo for food. Then Andrea's place, then out? Yeah to Brickseklar.  Don't remember much,  as you can see how incoherent I'm at the moment, we had lots of drinks.  I get home and check my camera, not only I have a bunch of random pictures of random people?  I have movies of this girl's ass being slapped?  Did I slap some ass?  Fuck I don't know.  It's freaking hilarious though.  Picture hosting through Hello is down, so I can't post any of the pictures at the moment.  And for the movies, I have to upload to my own hosting, but I'm too frecking lazy/drunk.  So screw you guys I'm going home.  MAMACITA!  I'll post tomorrow the pictures and the movies.

						   Here I am at home for lunch break.  I usually do not go home for lunch breaks, since I only take the standard 30 mins, however today it was just way to stressful at work, and this is just morning.  Of course customers, god when will this ever end.  And stupid people from the sales floor.  So someone from the sales floor tells the customer to come to the techshop to test a stupid power adapter, that we are equipped to test it.  so the customer waits in line.  Once I get to see the damn adapter, its not the "standard" type, its proprietary.  So of course customer start yelling at me because she was told that we could test it. To the fucking sales people out there, if you don't know what the hell you are talking about, tell them you don't know.  Because whatever these asses lie about will end up hitting back at ME. Then my boss yelled at me because, well he didn't want me to check in a particular unit from a certain customer.  Now two days ago, when I called him on his day off to ask what I should do, he said to do some stuff with it and if that doesn't work out, to check it in.  The unit has software issue, which is not covered by warranty but we do system restore using the warranty to "fix" software issue.  So what he said, sounded pretty normal to me.  Well he said that we can't keep repairing his software issues.  Ok that's fine, but I only got told about it TODAY, not two days ago.  I can understand he is stressed, I can even understand that since it was his day off yesterday, he was not really focused on what I was saying yesterday, but I only did what the TOLD me to do.  But he's a good guy, he just gets too stressed like myself.  So anyways, its been stressing, and it's goinga get more stressing.  I just can't wait the clock to tick 5PM so I can leave that hell hole, and go have some drinks with the Czech girls, and possibly go out.  Am I going to snap before 5PM and hand in my tags?  Only time will tell, hahah.

						     So my friend is trying to hook me up with this job at Citigroup. He said its pretty much guaranteed because I meet all the requirements, all they have to do is criminal background check on me.  The only problem would be that there is no base salary, its solely on commission.  But even before I get the certificate, I get 40% commission, and take in consideration I'll be working with accounts worth thousands of dollars. I always said anything financial is the epitome of all evil and greed, but I don't have much a choice.  I'm already a corporate tool I promised I would never be anyways. So how bad could it be if I work with the financial sector? Could this be the custhy job I've been looking for?  All I'll have to do is sit on my ass and make mad commissions.  The commission can go up to 80% depending on performance.  Plus since I don't have to show up at the office everyday, I can basically work just a couple of days a week.  The more commission I make, the less I have to work.  Isn't that just sweet?  Because of reduced work times, I can actually take this as a side job.  I don't know how it will go with my current job though, simply because it takes too much time off my hours through the week.  I might not have much time left for the job at Citigroup.  So I'll have to see how it works, and maybe I'll have to quit my current job depending on the results.    This was done informally, so there is no formal offer yet, he will have an answer a couple of months from now...  *Crosses fingers*

						   I just love those lazy days. Sleep and wake up really late.  Back in the days I really didn't notice it much, but working and all, made me really cherish my days off, and how badly I took my time off for granted.  Realities of a new life, I guess. Yeah I'm pretty much of a coporate tool that I promised myself I would never be, then comes rent, and assorted bills...  I have to take the corporate cock shafting just like everyone else.  If I only was in good terms with my parents...  Anyways, hitting the gym for now, then hitting the pool when Steve gets back from work.

						   Well work was hectic and stessful as usual.  Complaints after complaints.  Stuff without papers and missing stuff. Getting the shorter end of the stick... You know the drill.  Today I got a new phone, which can take pictures, that will help me out about not having to carry around my big ass camera.  The cool thing about this phone camera is that it has flash!  So I can take pictures anywhere.  Not as high quality as my Sony though.  So once I again me and Steve hit the pool.  Cold water! We didn't stay long though. We pretty much stayed at the hot tub with the jet of water massaging my back, while chatting to the Petra.  After a hard, stressful day of work, what better than just relaxing at the hot pool and talking to a nice girl?  Life is good!

						   So after work, all stressed and stuff, and Steve all tired from his insulation work, we decide to hit the pool.  Hate when the frecking water is cold. But its cool.  Some kids playing in the pool, so basically there was no resting for us in the pool, just a quick dip to refresh.  While I was still trying out the temperature of the water with the tip of my toes, Steve had already dived in and was across the pool striking up a conversation with the life guard.  I'm still trying to get in the "FUCKING POOL".  Hate cold pool. So this girl is from Czech Republic, and so are her other three friends and are also life guards.  Basically they are working as life guard at my building for the summer.  We get in to the hot tub and keeps on the conversation.  For our surprise they are temporarily living in the same building for the duration of the "contract".  So I asked if they been out do DC and stuff, and they said the got no car and has been only once for "shopping".  So I tell them that we should hang out/club sometime later on.  She said we should, so I guess it's on.  No biggie.  It's just damn convenient as Steve mentioned, four Czech girls with nowhere to go...under the same roof!

						    urlLink    Dinero!&nbsp; urlLink     So I was visiting my old school website checking alumni page and stuff. I came across tuition page so I checked the tuition fees.  My school always had the tuition pegged in US dollars to prevent loss from Brazilian currency devaluation.  So although it remained unchanged for couple of decades, the pay in Brazilian currency fluctuated a lot.  Anyways, so I do the calculation on what my parents spent on me just on tuitions from my primary to high school.  I'm shocked. It totalled up to US$ 1,130,000.00. Damn... Add my brother on top of that, it's US$ 2,260,000.00. Then I kept thinking, the amount of money me and my brother spent just by allowance, clothes, hospital/health bills, trips, cars, purchases, college, boarding, plane tickets, living abroad, wired money to us in the US, whatever, etc...  I just cannot fathom the staggering amount of money me and my brother drained from my parents.  My wild guess is that every cost and expenses from us must have totalled something up to 10 million dollars.  Then I thought, what if I add their own personal costs since they had us? Such as houses, and stuff? Must be some SICK amount of money.  I guess I'll have to be grateful to my parents and God that I was born in a well off family.  God I promise I will not curse much anymore!  And please give me the strenght to make that much myself!  How much money did YOU drain from you parents?

						     I dread the work on Sunday.  It's such a pain.  Work today was retarded, I don't mean the work itself, but customer issues.  The stupidity of the customers is just about to drive me insane.  I swear to god, these people just need to kill themselves, because they are just a waste of space in this world.  So, this girl, probably no older that 20 came with her mother and was having issues with her laptop.  The space key was lose, I tried to fix it first, but after a close inspection I knew it the laptop would have to have to be disassembled, although it seemed easy at first.  So ok I told her that there will be a charge of $139.97, which is flat rate for labor for any repairs.  To disassemble the laptop would take at LEAST about 30 mins.  She is like "Can't you just snap it back in? How can you charge 139.97 for something so simple, it would take you only a couple of minutes!"  Well, if its so freaking simple and it takes only couple of minutes, why are you wasting my time trying to have it repaired for free?  Do it yourself!  Plus I'm not the one charging you, it's the company that I work for. Also I'm not even supposed to do repairs, I'm not a technician.  So you try to give a hand and they end up wanting the whole arm.  Then she tells me "ok, I have another problem, I accidentally deleted Netscape and I can't open picture files anymore." So any other browsers can open picture files, and why the hell its is my problem that you accidentally deleted Netscape?  You already said that you aren't paying a dime, so why the hell its my problem?  Ok being the good guy I am and even after that bitch scene from the keyboard issue, I try to help her out by offering my arm.  I ask her where she store her pictures so I can open a picture and assign Internet Explorer to open her pictures from now on.  Her reply was "Uh, I don't know." Well then how the hell you expect me to know?  How the hell do you expect me to help you for FREE if you don't even know where the hell you store you own god dammed pictures?  Ok next problem.  What? More problem to be solved for free? Ok I extended my hand, my arm, ok my legs now? Fine.  "I can't install my Palm software." Ok, why don't you call Palm manufacturer?  Do I look like Palm representative to you? But Ok, I guess I'll help. "What error messages or what happens when you try to install the software?"  Her reply? "I don't know." Right there I was about to slap her silly across the face and tell her to GET A HOLD of herself.   "I told her, "Mam, if you don't know anything about your own computer, there isn't much I can do to help you, you can check the unit in for service.  With the $139.97 fee our technicians will run a full diagnostics on the unit." Her reply was "Well I'll figure something out at home, since you are not willing to help out. "  NOT WILLING TO HELP OUT???  HEY BITCH, WHY THE HELL I WASTED 30 MINS OF MY TIME WITH YOU FOR FREE?  THAT'S NOT TRYING TO HELP?? Keep in mind that because of this bitch there was line forming behind her.  Her mom should be proud to have raised such a blonde bimbo. And her mom had the audacity to say "We will call you later on so we can have this problem fixed over the phone." DO I LOOK LIKE FREE TECH SUPPORT NUMBER TO YOU?  You don't wan't to pay, your shit is not covered by our warranty, what the hell you want again??? I tell her "Yeah sure."  God it sucks to be a good guy.  I'm a very patient guy, but Jesus, no wonder I'm losing my sanity at work.  One of these days I'll just snap.  Slap a customer across the face and tell them to go away.  Grey hair, losing weight, what else?  Got to lit a cig after that one... I need somewhere to pour my hate!

						   So since none of my friends seen me at work except Eugene, I decided to post some pics of me at work on "uniform".  I think Dana saw it once while I was webcaming at work.  urlLink    Coworkers; Apple Hash, Jenny, and Myself.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    God damn customer issues...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    My tool at work to relieve the ridiculous amount of stress I get per day.&nbsp; urlLink

						   Well today I got in a chat with Dana, Misha and Sodo, its not that often that, that many people separated by distance logs on at the same time.  Having Ellie logged then, would have been perfect, but like anything remotely perfect in this world, it didn't happen.  Apparently, Dana had me blocked on her MSN messenger, well no wonder I could never see her online ever.  Also I think she had me blocked on her phone, because when I call her it ALWAYS go directly to her voicemail...  She says she has no idea why I would have been blocked on her MSN messenger.  I think I know...  Anyways, I had to leave the chat because I want to maintain a discipline of not missing the gym time.  So I hit the gym,  and start lifting some weights, then I do 40 minutes of elyptical and another session of weight lifting again.  By the time I was finishing the session, Steve came from work, so we hit the pool+spa.  I didn't get in the pool though, I went directly to the spa, because I just wanted to relax for various reasons.  Dinner coming up with Misha, Amy, Leavan, at Dragonfly.  Behave kids!

						   Ugh. I'm a wreck now.  Lunch with Misha and Aime, well too late.  Rough night I guess. Misha seems a bit pissed, because well, as soon as we got into Five yesterday, I don't remember ever seeing Misha again?  Maybe that was rude, left Misha in the cold, I don't know.  But lights were flashing in my eyes and making me dizzy!  I really don't remember what the hell I was doing much, anyways...  I don't even know if I should follow up on these numbers.   ok GYM!

						   So the night started slow at some American bar in M Street.  Of course I felt totally out of place.  So me and Carlos try to get some booty at the bar, but no success.  God dammit, no booty, so I call Taby.  She's at Five, ok fine me and Misha drive to Five, how?  I have no fucking clue.  Five was just plain... What the fuck was going on?  I know Dana is going to kick some Iranian ASS, so yeah, I had to hook up with her again before she can kick the living shit out of her. HAHAH.  Then I started to meet some really random girls.  Got two numbers,one is Stacy and the other one was Pam.  Pam was fun to meet, because she kept telling me, "Please tell me I'm hot."  I'm like "Ok, you are hot!"  Lol, so hook up again.  Had to juggle to not get caught by Taby, lol. I have no clue what the hell was going on anymore. Overall, it could have been really good, and I'm pretty sure it was, but tomorrow I won't remember shit.... SAD!   urlLink    It started slow somewhere, I don't remember.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    What's UP?&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Yeah ok.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Cheers!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Oh boy...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Jesus christ..., Taby&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Ok gotta cut the drinking...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Stacy..&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    I think I remember this girl, I think, lol&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Pam doing the thing...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Oh yeah.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The finger lick...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Pam and... fuck&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Hrmm...Heh&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    I love the stage!&nbsp; urlLink

						   I have been very inconsistent on waking up early to do my morning cardio, most of the times I end up just hitting the gym after work.  Today I just decided not to sleep in order to do the morning cardio. So I usually only do 20 mins of cardio, but to make up for the morning cardios I have missed, I decided to to 40 mins.  After that I was like, ok what the hell, I'll just do another set of 20 mins and make it one hour.  Not to shabby, but by the end of the set I was pushing it really hard.  At least now I know I can do 40 mins without any hassle.  Well I have to hit work now.  After it, like any other day, I'll hit the pool and spa with Steve after work, and do another session at the gym. And off course clubbing later on!

						   Well it was day off, and I didn't go partying or anything like that, which is unusual, however I got a lot of stuff done today.  These days, time just flies by...  Reorganized my closet, which was a monumnetal task, just the sheer amount of clothes in there can be intimidating.  Sorted out which had to go to the cleaners, which I had to do the laundry and which had to be dropped off at Salvation Army.  Now its all organized and neat.  I still have a shitload of shirts though... it's somewhat overflowing.  First, I took the clothes to the cleaners, then I dropped some clothes at the Salvation Army, then I took my phone to Sprint Store to have the camera phone reset, but they were not able to, then took the car to the car wash/vaccum, then hit the pool & spa, then put the clothes in the washing machine, then the gym, then move the clothes to the drying machine, then cook dinner and eat, then get the clothes from the drying machine and fold.  I still need to steam the shirts and shower.  So I was wearing this shorts the whole day, and I know it was a bit large, I just didn't realize it was awfully big until I started walk around in it.  Wallet, cell phone, and keys were enough weight to keep the shorts sliding down.  I had to stay the whole day holding on top my short to prevent it from falling all the way down.  Such a freaking hassle.  Going to try to hit bed early so I can hit the gym in the morning before heading to work, though, the way I sleep, I don't think it will happen, AGAIN. I have three alarm clocks, and EACH of them has 3 alarm ring times.  All of them are set at 8AM, 9AM, and 9:30AM(last call for work).  Of course I ignore all the rings, and I only wake up to the 9:30AM one.  By then I'm like "Shit, work!" Flying to the bathroom, take a shower, brush my teeth, wear work clothes and fly to work...  Something funny,  while I was looking through my closet I tried a couple of belts.  Well some of them were just too large for me.  Here is a pic of one of the belts, with a dime as comparison. The last of the first set of holes was where I used to wear them.  The new hole at the left side I what I am at now... Now it goes around my waist once and HALF. lol  urlLink    Old belt.&nbsp; urlLink

						    urlLink    Some clothes from the batch.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    My Armani shirts. DAMMIT!&nbsp; urlLink     Everyone knows that in the last couple of years I've been donating a staggering amounts of clothes to the Salvation Army, simply they would no longer fit me, because they are too big for me. Its funny though, because, some of the clothes still had the price tags on, and were never worn... sigh.  But what can I do?  They no longer fit me, unless I put some weight, which I definately do not want to.  Because of the incident with my closet yesterday, I went through all the clothes, and reorganized them, only to find out that another large batch of clothes does not fit me anymore again!  God dammit.  The tally is as follows;  Banana Republic: Pants 6 Shirts 4 t-shirts 3  Ralph Lauren: Shirts 8 Pants 5 t-shirts 5 coat/jacket 1 Shorts 4  Giorgio Armani: Shirts 2  Armani Exchange: t-shirts 4  Calvin Klein: Jeans 4 Shirts 2  Gap: Jeans 5 Shorts 1  Tommy Hilfiger: Shirts 3  Hugo Boss: Shirts 3  Generic: t-shirts 8  Some, once again, has its price tags STILL on...  Some at the Salvation Army will be mighty happy, again....  I still got tons of shirts(phew), but pants wise I only have 6 left, and 4 jeans :(  I guess that's the price I pay for buying a lot of clothes and I never get to use.  Probably I'm gonna lose a couple more in the next few months, and donate more.  I guess this time I'll keep my closet more streamlined with just a couple of clothing items..  No more of "Ok, I lost weight, I need a whole new set of clothes."  I mean I will just buy a whole lot of clothes and I'll never get to use, only to find out that I lost more weight down the road and I need a new set...

						   I feel so bad today, a lot of stress and a bit sick.  One coworker basically got two others sick, myself included. When I got home I went straight to the spa, but I could just not relax.  I was getting irritated with minor things that I should not be worrying about.  For example, before hitting the spa I could not find my sandals, so I basically "threw" out on the floor all my clothes in a rage trying to find them out.  Now my closet is a wreck.  Everyone knows me that I'm very patient, easy going, and calm natured.  After the incident, I was thinking to my self, what the hell just happend?  It's just a freaking sandal!  I swear that this job is changing me, in bad ways...  I need out, I need out..  Going to hit gym to see if I can get this rage out somehow.

						   Today was tough, a misjudgement from a coworker lead this really rude/bitchy/crancky customer to unload all her load on me.  Same shit, different day.  Always the shit has to be dealt by me, I have to front the mini hitlers even when its someone else's error. So of course Kay was trying to help deal with it.  Kinda feel bad because he took shit from the customer too, and it wasn't even his fault.  So I just snapped today and handed in my tags to Kay and said "I quit."  This is the second time I snap at work.  I really don't know how much longer I can handle this.  I don't even mind getting overworked, but its overworked, bad pay, and way too much stress.  Kay followed me all the way to my car, even Joe came out from the store to try to persuade me to stay.  Funny thing is that I don't even have a job line up yet I "quit" twice.  I guess its just the shitload of stress I get at work.  Maybe I'm not thinking too clearly when I'm stressed.

						   Hmm fuck, I have to drive all the way to DC NOW to make a deposit in my brother's account at Citibank.  I promised him I would, so ... I don't understand why he has to get an account in a bank is nowhere near our building. My bank is shitty BB&T but one of its branches is located right between my building and my work.  Work is one minute from my building, and the bank is two minutes from my building.  Fifteen  to twenty minutes drive each way.... for a bank...

						   I miss one day of work out and damn, I'm back to level 0.  When I started hitting gym again, it was hard at first, but then it was getting easy.  I would always be energized throughout the whole work out.  Yesterday I left work late, I mean really late, I was the last one to leave the tech shop.  I came home all tired and deicide to miss gym for that day, however I was planning to wake up early today, and hit gym before work.  So I sleep, and sleep, only to be woken up by a phone call.  It my boss asking if I'm going to show up at work today?  Ok quick shower, brush teeth, clothes, and fly to work.  Thank god I live 1 minute away from work!  So I missed the morning gym.  Hmm ok, so I try to leave work at 5pm, as I'm supposed to, I end up leaving at 7pm.  Pool, spa, and relax, got lazy, but I was not willing to miss another day at gym.  So I do 10 minutes jogging to warm up, then 20 minutes of eliptical, then 10 minutes of walking to cool down.  GOD.  Like yesterday I could have done another set of these without any problem, today was like dragging myself to the death valley.  So whatever, I lift some weights, and came back up.  Now I'm dead tired....

Plus I would hate to see $50 GMail accounts invitation go down the drain.  I still have one left, I'm still thinking on what I should do with it.  Maybe get a kick ass name and sell at ebay for $100? hahah, nah.

						   Well, I guess I will not stop with the photography gadget fever... So I bought today a photo printer, the Sony DPP EX5.  This gadget is so cool!  It prints better/sharper than regular lab photo.  Each pic has a "glossy" coating (seals the picture paint).  There is no need to wait for the ink to dry nor its will smudge if you drop water on it.  Did I say how sharp and vivid are the colors?  The print "pack" I have now is for postcards "format" So it has that postcard template behind.  Not only that, it connected to the TV and offer razor sharp view of the pictures and it even do "slideshow".  This is really cool.  It also offers some  "fun" feature such as making calendars.  All I have to do is stick the Sony memory stick pro in there, directly from my camera.  Or, I can simply connected to my computer through USB.  But watching the slideshow on TV is much more fun.   urlLink    Sony DPP EX5&nbsp; urlLink     And the phone I mentioned ealier.  Samsung VGA 1000 phone with camera and FLASH!   urlLink    Samsung VGA 1000&nbsp; urlLink

						   So I was really tired from yesterday, had to get to work before 11AM, and my boss was on my ass because he thought I would simply not show up to work because I've been having a rough night almost every weekend.  When he saw the pictures from the night before, he called me in the morning so to make sure I was at work... hahah Well Sundays, I guess you all know how I hate working on Sunday, it not just the customers acting like mini Stalins, its also I'm always tired from partying the night before. After work, me and Steve went to the pool, but the water was too cold, so we went to stay the rest of the pool hours at the spa.  I just love the spa, so relaxing. Anyways, Alan, and Misha invited us to go to watch movies, well we are tired as hell, I'm still trying to hit gym today... if not I'll just hit gym before work... and go again after work... arg.

						   Damn,it was fun tonight! So Alan got a "cold" so he didn't go out, Misha, well he was MIA, and Andrea had her parents visiting her.  So it was me and Carlos, but It was Carlos coworkers/friends.  So Basically I went there out of the blue solo style. I meet two very sweet girls; one is called Gina from Yale School of Management or so her card says, the other sweet girl was Rosanne.  She is American, but she lived in Rio for a couple of months, so we connected real quick.  Well two phone numbers to call next weekend,  not bad. Then I met a bunch of other girls and some guys, and well fuck, I don't remember, because I'm too fucked up.  Rosanne put her phone on my cell phone, so there is no way not to remember her, and Gina gave her card, so as long as I don't lose it, it should be fine.. Carlos was on the prowl tonight..  HAHAHA Fuck, it was fun as hell. Too bad I won't remember shit tomorrow, at least with pics I will be able to gloss over and try to remember what happened today. HAHAHA  urlLink    Shake it baby!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Give it to me baby!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Rosanne and Gina, sweetest girls I met tonight.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Carlos, you dog, arf arf!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Moi and Rosanne, god damn my asian glow.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Group shot.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    What's up girls?&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    I wish I was in the middle!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    The bartender wanted some piece of the action!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Groups shot #2&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Now I feel at home.

After lazying out for a couple of minutes I got a call from Alan for drinks and movie at his place.  So me and Steve went to the gym for a quick workout and we are now getting ready to go to Alan's place.  I just hope those asses are in the mood to go out tonight.  Because yesterday, ALL of them, Carlos, Alan, and Misha acted like fruits. FRUITS.  Cocktail FRUIT!

						   Ok so I think NYC is not happening,  because basically Sound Factory is Saturday night, and well I work Sunday morning... But it's alright, since there is a bunch of stuff happening tonight.  Sander Kleinber will be spinning at Buzz, or I can go to that club as a freelance photographer, or just hit any clubs in the 18th Street area.  Today, at work, it was very decent.  There was no customer issues nor I just cared much about it anymore.  After I gave the notice, I feel liberated.  I was really upbeat at work, wouldn't stress at all.  It seems that one of the managers is bailing out as well.  One of the good managers.  He is the one that bought the BMW from Eugene.  I felt really awkward today regarding my haircut... Specially when this customer was like staring at me.  I was explaining her what could be the problem with her computer and what needs to be done.  After I was done telling her, she didn't say anything, there was his long pause.  So I go, "Hello?", and she is like "Oh. Oh! I'm sorry, what did you say?"  So I explained again, what it was and that was the end of it.  However, during that pause/stare I was just thinking how horrible was my hair.  I don't know I really never used gel on my hair, nor it was this short ever.  Just the thought that the gel "dried" my hair on a different/weird "style".  The whole day I was worried about my hair.  I know its lame, but what the hell.  I need to learn how to use the gel or just get used to the new almost bare naked haircut.  Ok time to hit the spa, and them gym.  I'll let you kids know what I'll be doing later tonight.

						   So I told my boss that I'll be leaving in about a month.  I really wanted to stay there, because I like some of the people I work with, however I also have to look out for myself.  Anyways, so me, Misha and Steve went to dinner at Peacock Cafe, and had the usual Lamb Steak, but it was such a guilt trip....HEH Misha was telling me that we should go to Milan, and Steve is up for it too.  So hmm like sometime in September I could hit Milan with them, and me and Misha would make a stop in Latvia.  Me, Misha, and Steve might hit NYC tomorrow, er today?  Friday night I mean.  We will probably be going to Sound Factory.  I told them I'm broke and they were like, "forget the money, would you go?" And off course I replied yes.  LOL  Regarding my visit to Iowa, well since I will be making a job change, I don't know if I will have the money to go... I still have to see...  Hopefully I'll have some money and visit Dana.

						   So I asked the lady for something summerish, something that will keep my head cool for the summer heat.  I tell her, make something a bit short, and I have faith on her.  She grabs the machine and starts to mow down all my hair.  At that point I start to freak out.  After everything was cut down, when I check the mirror, OMG, its like ARMY cut.  WHERE DID ALL MY HAIR GO TO!!!  My brother and Steve says its not short, well it IS to me.  You all know this is very short to me.  I feel naked... :(  So I tried to talk to my boss today, but didn't get a chance, so I guess I'll talk to him tomorrow.   urlLink    Army cut.&nbsp; urlLink

						   So I was talking to Steve about my current situation at length, and I have to agree with him, it's just not worth it.  Bottom line is that I just don't get paid enough, once I pay all the bills I just don't have much left to do anything.  On top of that just the sheer amount of shit I get from work just makes my life even more miserable.  So the plan is to tell my boss Steve-O now so he has plenty of time ahead to find a replacement, I don't think just two weeks will be enough time for him. After about one month, I'll get this insualtion work Steve was doing, for about three months, until I get that job at Citigroup.  I mean the pay at insulation work pays about two times what I currently get paid at SlaveUSSR anyways, then well Citigroup just pays a fuckload more.  Ok, so I'm gonna hit the gym now, then I'm heading to work to do some accumulated work at my day off, and also to let me boss Steve-O know about what I'll be doing.

						   I'm kinda fed up with my job.  I had the freaking management bitching at me yesterday because I didn't knew how to prepare this certain paperwork.  Well if you guys had actually trained me properly or taught me how to do it, then I would had fucking know.  So now what? I'm supposed to pull shit out of my ass?  Just like that?  I called my boss to ask about it, he didn't answer the phone, and I didn't expect to, it was his day off.  What the fuck you want me to do then?  Don't go bitching at me how its taking too long, I told before, I DON'T know how to do it because I was never trained or taught how to do it.  I have to get shit from customer the whole day, and now the fucking management.  Way to treat your own fucking employees, no fucking wonder, not many people last in that company.  If you management could please get the head out your asses, the company wouldn't be this mess.  All you people do is yell, and bitch, MORE MORE MORE MORE from employees.  How about you guys grow some balls and fire the less reliable/unproductive employees and have a good benefit/retention to the employee that really works hard?  How about you guys communicate better with other managers from different department so you guys don't freaking overstep you own authority in a different department?  Bottom line is, you guys retain the most untrained, unmotivated, because anyone that comes in actually "caring" ends up leaving or not giving a rat's ass about the job.  They just get their pay check and go home.  And what you guys do? Hire more new untrained blood right from the streets and fill the company.  Yeah that will help a lot.  Keep abusing the current situation where there are people lined up for any jobs, because this company will be in a constant loop of employees that has no experience.  And you  wonder why customer bitch about customer satisfaction?  Yeah keep flooding the sales floor with new employees while tech dept REALLY needs more people.  That sign of really bad management.  Anywho, yesterday Steve go scammed on some speakers.  It was the same speakers/story where Sodo got scammed a couple of years ago.  The so called "Digital Research" speakers.  They try to convince people that the speakers are worth $1600 each and lower it to selling at $300 for a pair.  I really don't know how these two smart people ever fell this.  Both Georgetown graduates....  Business school. lol.  The speakers work and all, but the sound quality is definitely not worth $150 each.  More like $70.  So you people out there when some dudes pull out a car in the parking lot and try to sell some shady speakers, its a scam.  So my knee had a huge bruise.  Funny thing is that I get bruises all the time, and I don't know when or how I got it.  Usually the bruises are small, but this one is the size of my knee....   urlLink    Bruised knee&nbsp; urlLink

						   Since Danita calls me the "pleasure man" due to my picture post of Günther, I guess I should explain, what this is about.  All my friends know that one of my most commonly used nickname is Gui.  And everyone knows its pronouced as "ghee" as if you were reading Gui in portuguese.  So when I joined SlaveUSSR, my boss's sister asked who was this Gui, however she pronouced as "gooey".  After that my nickname at work became Gooey.  Fast forward to present.  My boss found this funny website, of this group/band/singer called Günther Pleasure Man and the Sunshine Girls( www.gunthernet.com ), which we thought it was hilarious.  With hit songs such as Ding Dong Song and Teeny Weeny String Bikini. Hit song Ding Dong Song 's lyrics goes along the lines of "Oooh you touch my tra la la, hmmmm my ding ding dong. Deep in the night, I'm looking for some fun.  Deep in the night, I'm looking for some love."  Also the guy is just plain hilarious.  His motto is Glamour, Champagne, Love, Sex, and Respect!  So I thought; I live for Glamour, Champagne, Love, Sex, and Respect already.  I'm also really smooth and suave like him.  It was just a matter of time for me to combine "gooey" with Günther, creating göönther.  Of course I also made a göönther flyer wearing Günther shades!  So there it is what this göönther and Güntherism is all about.   urlLink    göönther pleasure man.  Glamour, Champagne, Love, Sex and Respect!&nbsp; urlLink

						   So I got challenged by Danita (aka the Steamy, Sexy, Threesome Action Hotline operator) to describe what my perfect job would be. You mean other than having steamy, sexy, threesome action???  Boooo!  Well as many know, I live my life for partying, clubbing and wholesome fun.  I basically grew up doing what I do best, setting up parties, going to parties, and having fun.  I love to interact with people, make sure "my" people are having fun, in club/party situation.  You know, big papa style.  All parties I ever organized, be it solo or in groups, were always very successful in terms of all the praise we get later on. So I guess its only fair to say that I probably would excel working at some kind of hospitality business.  I would probably open a chain for bar/clubs like Crobar, but I'm leaning more towards separate clubs, instead of chains.  This gives more versatility on changing each venues accordingly without having to do a major overhaul on the whole freaking chain.  Plus venues needs to meet the demands of the immediate area.  Also venues need to be constantly remodeled and adapting.  Above all, I want to DJ once in a while as a hobby, and what a better place than my OWN club eh?  I'll be DJ göönther!  Glamour, Champagne, Love, Sex, and Respect!  I was once thinking about hotels and resorts, but Jesus, although I can deal well with people and I am a very patient guy, after working at SlaveUSSR, I'm like, no, the amount of customer complaints to deal with will just be unbearable, make me die at 40.  No thank you, no siree!  Then there is the aspect of charity.  This is also very important to me.  I don't know why, I was just raised this way.  I always donated part of my allowance to charity since like when I was 12 years old.  Sure once I hit college and my father started being an ass about allowance and how I have to live within a budget, I stopped donating money to charity, however I never ceased to donate other things, such as clothes I don't need (even new clothes).  Now, well basically I live on slave pay, so I'm really scrapping the bottom of the pot, but just like college years, I still donate clothes when I can.  I don't do this for tax exemption or anything like that, I'm just too lazy to fill out the paperwork for that. LOL!  So, it would be really nice to me to do charity events in clubbing venues,  like during Christmas, I could charge toys instead of cash. Or on some other event, I could charge blankets and canned food.  But all I really want is, somewhat comfortable life, beautiful wife, beautiful son and daughter, a dog, and a nice house.  Very simple no frills type of thing.  Oh I still would call the Steamy, Sexy, Threesome Action Hotline though to spice up my simple life! :P

						   So as posted earlier, I spent most of the days laying on the couch, looking at the ceiling.  Most people know, when I'm not feeling well I get irritated easily.  Though, I my hard travel case for my camera finally arrived today. So it wasnt shut face the whole day.  At first I thought it was a bit big, but then I realized is was a TRAVEL case that I ordered.  Has lots of padding to protect the camera, locks, and lots of compartments to put all the accessories for the camera in there.  The case also looks sleek in the silverish tint that matches my camera.  Went to the spa, which REALLY relaxed me today.  After it, I of course, did a light session of cardio of 20 minutes, and 20 minutes of weight lifting.  Ready to hit the bed, hit gym again in the morning and get to work.   urlLink    Travel case (closed)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Travel case (open)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    I get irritable when I don't feel well. :(&nbsp; urlLink

						   Today was simply awful.  So I wake up really early around 4AM, so I can hit the gym early before heading to work.  In order to not look like like weirdo I decide to at least wait till 6AM to hit the gym.  I start lifting weights, and I must say it was painful, and had almost no strenght left.  Since I've been pushing to the limit everyday.  Then I do 40 minutes of elliptical, only to be followed by another set of weight lifting.  My guess is that the last set of weight lifting didn't go too well wit the rest of the body.  I started to feel acute pains to my stomach, my muscles were really stressed/contracted.  And above all, I had no more energy left.  Basically I had to request the day off from work.  My boss was ok with it.  Thanks Steve!  Basically I spend the whole day on my couch looking at the ceiling, waiting for the pains to subdue.  When Amy called for lunch, well I was still in bad shape, so I had to tell her that maybe some other time.  I kind feel bad about it, because, well we work so close to each other and we were already talking about having lunches together during our lunches breaks, so I was looking forward to it.  I gave her my work days schedules, so she knows when to call me again.  Couple of hours later I was feeling much better.  I guess those painkiller really done the job.  Today I'll just do 20 minutes of cardio and just one set of weight lifting.  EVERYTHING FOR IOWA "WILLING" SHIRTLESS GIRLS IN THE HEAT OF IOWA SUMMER!  But before that, pool and spa, to relax.

						   Today I got late at work, my boss that usually calls me when I'm late (in case I am sleeping, wake up call), didn't even bother to call me.  He thought I finally gave up on the work and quit.  If I was 100% certain about the job at Citigroup I would have quit already, but nothing much I can do.  I mean, how am I supposed to pay the bills?  My boss is amazed that I actually lasted this long at this job.  So do I!  But he knows, that eventually I'll have to quit... Sad, because people I work with are cool.  It seems like he had a good time in Kansas, pimping, just being Mac Daddy.  I have to check the pictures, see how it is the Kansas nightlife.  Maybe something like Iowa?  Work was somewhat cruise mode. There were some mistakes that put me a in a state of stress, but the customers in general was cool.  So it was alright.  Customer were really nice today, praising me for my willingness to find solutions to what they need. Speaking of, there are these "chips" where you get for exceptional work or customer service.  So far I got 16, but the second guy is dead close at 10-12 chips.  I need to pull the weight I guess.  So after work, I didn't hit the pool+spa.  Steve was already back from work trying to make his IPod work.  I mean there was only like 40 minutes of pool+spa left anyways.  Talked to Dana about "planned" visit next month to Iowa.  I just want the promised girls+girls action, "willing" shirtless girls in the dead heat of Iowa summer(as Dana said).  LOL  So I guess it's only natural that I worked extra hard at the gym today. I did one and a half hours of straight weight lifting, until my muscles were crying for mercy and saying "no mo".  Then I did 20 minutes of elliptical.  I'll have to make up for the elliptical tomorrow, because I want a net average of 40 minutes of elliptical everyday on a weekly basis.  So, ugh, ONE hour of elliptical tomorrow...  Couldn't meet up Misha today, because well once I got from gym was too late.   Good night all.  Oh yeah, I have to leave this reminder.

						   Ealier today I was frantically trying to "sleep" off the alcohol.  I only had a couple of hours before work.  As you all know I get the "asian glow" so there is no way for people to not notice I'm drunk.  And with the inability of my body breaking down alcohol, you can see the rush I get out of alcohol.  Anyways, so I'm awoken by some noise, which hardly happens because I sleep like a rock.  It was my brother coming back from work and Steve about to leave to work.  About three to four hours had passed since I went to bed, and I was still drunk!  I began to eat and drink water in a lame attempt at making my drunkard state go away.  Sleep for two more hours, and no more bloodshot eyes, or asian glow, ready to go to work!    Work was tiring because of clubbing, but it was allright.  But at the end of the day I was requested to work for couple more hours.  I handed down a can of whoop ass on Kay, felt bad for the guy though, he is a good guy.  I told him why in the hell, lazy people that don't do shit, leave stuff undone or incomplete and those that work hard are expected to work more?  Oh please.  He said that he can count on me, thats fine and dandy, but at one point it feels more like abuse than counting on me.  Do I get any benefit? No! I only have freking operations manager breathing on my neck about overtime....  They let lazy people go and expect overworkers to work more without any benefit, only to have manager bitch at you or cut overtime.  Way to go!

						   Oh boy, So, I pick up Misha at home, then drive to Waterfront, Sequoia, for dinner with Tyler and Amy, and two sisters.  ALL TEXANS.  So I'm trying to see if they are going to hit a club or something, because I definately want to hit on Tyler.  She wants to go to Dialy Grill for Bush rally or some shit like that.  Ok, adieu!  HAHAH.  Whatever, but because of heavy drink I decide to hit Daily Grill, I mean, I'll hit it.  She is not there, I guess she left.  We hit Blue Gin?  Don't remember much. So I call booty call, Tabby.  She said she wants to hit out tonight, ok..... HAHA, So I tell her that me and Misha will be hitting Dragonfly, and we will meet there to decide what to do.  So we get there, check up stairs, and it's not really "happening".  While this I get a call from Tabby saying that she didn't realize how late it was and she will not be going out tonight.  Fine, we hook up next weekend then!  LOL.  So me and Misha hit Sesto Senso, once again it's not really happening there, so I tell Misha that we should hit Five.  I ask the guy at the door, what's going on, and he replied that "it's packing, house music."  Fine.  We get into Five.  Once again, I lose Misha, same as yesterday.  Start to meet a bunch of random girls...  This particular girl stand out though, she wants to be photoraphed by me all the fucking time.  Then she wants a picture with me.  That's fine, I just wish I could remember her name, but man... I had so much drink... Some drinks, some dancing, some grind...  Anyways, the funniest shit ever was I met this dude, he wants me to show up to this club he is promoting and do some freelance photographing... I asked him, no cover and free drinks?  He is like sure, that should cover your "work".  So I accepted and he gave me his business card.  HAHAHAHAHAH.  So seriously, I think I should start doing some freelance DC nightlife photography as a hobby.

						   So its Friday again, I'll be hitting Nation with Misha and Alan for Tiesto.  I've been to all the events here in DC that brought Tiesto and not once that guy let me down.  He just do some wicked shit on the turntables.  I bought my tickets online ealier and I'm basically ready to go.  Before that though, I'm going to hit the gym for two hours, then meet up with Misha and Alan at Alan's place for a couple of drinks and I'm hitting Nation early, around 11PM'ish.  Got the gear and all.  Quitting job soon, might as well let it go.  WOOOHOOO!!!  Too bad they don't let people bring in camera in the venue.

						   So I've decided to leave my current job a week early so I get to enjoy myself before commiting to the other work.  The other work will be two months non stop of work.  There are many event coming up this month, I'm going to enjoy ALL of them, get my party gear, and party like there is no tomorrow.  Then I'll dissapear for two months, heh. So there will be a lot of nice events coming up, and although I wish some of my friends were here, I guess I'll have to do it solo...  Been doing lot of solo lately anyways. :P

I'm just going to enjoy DC till July 16th, going to enjoy the stash I've been saving, and just enjoy the night. :) Then I'm going to Illinois for two months of work and I'll see what I'll do after.  I'm actually thinking on leaving work like a week before 16th, that way I get a chance to go out and enjoy before the deadline...

						   I didn't post anything after work yesterday, just because I was too tired and slept right after I got back home from work.  Although work was stress free, there was a lot of work to do yesterday.  I had a good nine hours of sleep, was able to to hit gym for cardio and weights. Now I'm energized for work.  I have to make sure that today I make a decision if I'm going to Iowa or not. I'm running out of time.  It seems like Dana will be coming over to DC only if Ellie gets here, and if Ellie get to DC will be end of August, so I will not be here anymore by then.  Either I visit Dana in Iowa or in China.  However, Dana is telling me to save money and not to visit her.  Well, I really might be interested in visiting her in China, but its will cost me a whole lot more.  I'm about to say fuck it for the whole trip thing.

						   I was just remembering something from this past Saturday night, that it still makes me laugh.  Now everyone knows I'm a very peaceful person, I'm always the "peacemaker" when a fight is about to break loose in the club.  Five was pretty packed, it was really hard to move at all.  And I'm used to packed places, so when I say it's packed, its PACKED!.  So anyways, I'm trying to head back from the bathroom to the first floor, trying to get past people around, as gently as possible, without pushing people around.  Then comes this bitch.  You know, those skinny blond with "I'm the PRINCESS" syndrome. She is right behind me also trying to go through the massive crowd.  Now the reason I'm not moving is that the people in front of my is not moving, or at least they are trying, just like me.  Now this bitch decide to just yell "move" and pushed me aside.  At this point I felt the same thing I feel when I'm about to snap on someone at work. So I aimed my face at her, and yelled back really loud, "FUCK YOU BITCH!"  HAHAHA, I saw a couple of heads turning at this point.  I don't care if you are a pretty girl, if you act like a bitch, I will call you a bitch and treat you like a bitch.  So this buff guy, like twice my height, which at this point I'm interpreting as her "boyfriend" tells me, "What did you call her?"  And I immediatelly replied, "You heard it.  I said FUCK YOU BITCH.  I'm trying to get past just like her, there is no need to act like a bitch and push people aside."  Now I thought, ok I'm gonna get into a fight, possibly get beat up really bad and be kicked out of the club.  But if I'm going to get beat down, I might as well go out in a blaze of glory and toss some fists and kicks myself.  So basically I was waiting for him to toss that fist first.  And  I think the people around were expecting the same thing, because they were just there staring.  So I gave my mean look, and waited... To my surprise, this guy tells me, "Oh man, I'm sorry, I didn't know she pushed you aside, I'm sorry."  That was unexpected, but I had to let him know, that he needs to keep his bitch under the leash, so I tell him, "It's allright, it wasn't you who pushed me aside, it was that bitch over there (pointing at the girl)."  The girl gave me the evil look, but didn't do anything, and guy, just walked to her and then left to a different spot with her, with his tails between his legs, and the girl with her pride hurt.  I was talking about this with Steve, and basically he said that people here in DC are bunch of pussies, for the lack of a better word.  And I agree, DC is all about image, even if someone is twice my size or buff, it just the image it project. The moment they see a nutcase korean/brazilian calling their girlfriend a bitch, with a look of a convict/felon, they back down.  This happens all the time when I drive... Like when people are trying to get in my lane, you either; speed up and take over, OR you slow down and get behind me.  Some people can't do that, or its "too" complex to understand simple physics; they just honk, as if it's my problem.  Of course, when that happen, I always put my car in such a position and blocks all the traffic, and I make a scandal out of it.  I step out of the vehicle and march straight to their car with my "trademarked" convict/felon look.  At this point EVERYONE just start to shut their window up and are making sure the car locks are locked. None ever open the windows or stepped out of the car to confront me.  HAHA these people.

						   Now I don't mind my leisure clothes being a bit loose, because I don't want to look uptight, but I do expect work clothes to fit well.  Simply because people look more professional instead of a slob. Now the only pants that had a good fit, were  my work pants, now they are big.  Same goes to the sweater I wear for work.  They look like potato bags. Sigh...  No money for new clothes....

						   I was expecting like a three hour nap or four at most.  I wake up its about 3AM already, so much for going to the gym.  I will just have to go to gym around 6AM ish.  I checked Ellie's blog and she managed to get a vacation by end of August.  I guess that miniskirt and lipstick really worked.  Kinda sad though, that I will not be here.  I'll be working in Illinois for two months straight.  I guess I could drop by Japan when visiting Dana in China, however, Japan is REALLY expensive....  I wasn't able to see Ellie when she was in Iowa, now I will not be able to see her again while in DC.  Guess its faith...  Crappy faith...

						   Today was harsh... I got home really late, so I decided not to sleep and go straight to work.  I knew if I had slept I would just have not woken up to go to work.  So while waiting to go to work I couldn't even hit the gym, because I was so tired.  Work wasn't stressfull, but like I said before on my previous posts, after I gave my one month notice, I really don't feel the stress affecting anymore, I feel liberated from this evil tyrrany.  Nate came to help out at 1PM, which was great, he was really upbeat and he even paid lunch.  I was about to die, but thanks to him my job got easier today.  So I'm trying to buy tickets to go to Iowa, but still can't decide on a date and the tickets are getting pricier by the minute.  I call Dana to try to set a concrete date.  Welp she wants me to save my money, and not go visit her, if I do, she will not pick me at the airport.... However my July 16th deadline will be approaching soon and after that I will be GONE for two months straight.  So basically its before July 16th or after mid September.  And visiting her in China will cost a whole lot more than a trip to Iowa.  She said she might come down here, but well then I've been lifting weights for nothing.  Because I was doing it for the Iowan willing shirtless girls in the dead heat of the summer.  And "the" girl from Iowa too. :P  Perfect would be for Dana come here for certain events in DC, and the on the same week I visit her in Iowa.  Though, Dana wasn't in the same "level" as me today, so we didn't get anything figured out...  I need to lift weight, so I need to take a nap first, then hit the gym.

						   Hey Dana, I totally forgot. I called you ealier, but your mother said you were out and she asked me to call you back in like 45 minutes, but I totally forgot about it.  Anyways I need to talk to you about, when you are coming here.  I know you rather have Me going over there, and I'll try, but there are couple of events coming up in DC that you might want to get down here.  June 25th, Tiesto will be spinning at Buzz/Nation. July 3rd, Armin van Buuren will be spinning at Glow/Loft-Dream. July 4th, Paul Oakenfold will be spinning at Buzz/9:30 Club. July 9th, Deep Dish will be spinning at Buzz/Nation.  Well what do you say?  I'll be working today till 6PM so I won't be able to get your call, but leave me a message anyways.  MUAH!

						   Ok today I redeemed myself at Five.  It is my staple ground, and it was really awkward I didn't get any Friday night.  But today I changed that back.  Monsieur Pineau, monsieur Poullet, and monsieur Womo, left early for some odd reason.  It was just me and Steve braving out there.  Fine less men to block us! hahaha.  Lately I've been getting so many napkins with numbers and e-mails that I've been having a hard time put a name to a face on the pictures.

						   So in the last month or so I bought many gadgets and its accessories, specially for the Sony camera. I bought one bag for the camera, which was fine at first, but after I started to buy memory stick case, extra battery, it became too small, so I bought another bag which everything fits in fine.  The old bag now I use to carry my Gameboy advance or MD and CD player.  I also bought the "big" travel hard case for the camera, for when taking to trips or something.  I also bought a 256 Sony memory stick and a Sony memory stick case.  Then of course, the Sony photo printer for the picture I take.  Then I bought the Sony CD player to replace the Philips I broke, and a Sony MD player/recorder(black one with NetMD) to replace my old Sony MD player/recorder(the blue one at the back).  Then I got the phone with the camera/flash for those moments when I can't/forgot to take the camera.  And one good video card for my computer since the previous one was getting old.  I also bought a cradle for my Sony Clie but its not in the picture.  Total cost was something mad that I'm afraid to say it in public, but it was well worth it.  It all started with the Sony camera I bought...   Hmm isn't it odd that most of the stuff is Sony?  urlLink    Stuff!&nbsp; urlLink

						   Damn, today I woke up like 4PM with my brother nagging about how he wants to go out for lunch.  Ok cool, woke up, took a quick shower and went to a "Chinese buffet".  Because when I mean "Chinese cuisine" here in USA it is the americanized Chinese cuisine.  But I was starving like mongolian ready to plunder and pillage the village.  So I didn't care, even though I would eat Chinese food every day at work....  So after that, I lazied out a bit, played some games, then helped Doso with his blog, which, by the way, its getting quite nice.  Go check it out.  Now I'm going to the gym pump some iron again and do some cardio, after it going to buy some soda at 7 eleven.  And I must get ready for tomorrow, its FRIDAY! NIGHT OUT DAY! Ah damn should I even call "the" girl?  I mean I screwed up royally last weekend... RIGHT...hahah  Oh yeah, another one of those online quiz.   You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   Today I got this e-mail from Dana with a movie file attachement labeled HOW_MEN_SCREW_UP_ROMANCE_1.mpeg, so I have a look at it. So before I proceed have a look at the >>  urlLink movie     Now that you have seen the movie, let me tell you what was going on in my mind when I was watching it.  So when the woman is in the tub, being all sexy and all, I thought to myself, "Damn, that tub, would be so nice to do a cannonball jump in it, its big enough, and the water must be  warm and nice".  So out of the blue this guy does exactly what I was thinking.  I'm like "WTF?" I mean you guys would do the same thing right?    There is a nice girl in the tub: check The tub is large enough: check The water seems warm and nice: check There is a cold beer by the tub: check  And I'm not kidding, if you are in a good mood and if there is  hot girl in the hot tub with a cold beer waiting for you, you would jump in with excitement!  Just remember guys are just overgrown kids, we no longer play with the same toys, but we still play with different toys, and we act like a kid most of the times.   So I guess Im the type of guy that screw up romance. :(  Was there a hidden message there Dana?  Trying to let me know something? hahaha.  Funny movie nonetheless.

						   So Doso finally updated his blog.  He started february but after the initial post he never posted anything since.  He is trying to learn how to use Hello! to upload pictures.  Once he gets the hang of it, he should be posting more often.  Supposedly he was in the middle of nowhere for about a month doing the election thing for his mother in the steppes of Mongolia.  He said he will upload some pictures soon.  Misha had made a quick blog, though he never posted anything, and it seems he deleted the whole blog itself, why?  Dunno.  Ellie, well...  I guess she is really busy.  When you move out, move out here to DC!  Talk with Dana for more details on that.  So it just me and Dana blogging lately....

						   Today was a lazy day, I pretty much went to gym right after waking up.  Did cardio for about 20 minutes and then followed by about one hour of weights.  After that I decied to go to my "old" place of employement, to pick up phone numbers of some of my fellow co-workers.  I also wanted to talk to my ex-boss because although the "differences" I rather leave work on a good note.  Whatever it was, I don't think it would be worth let it sour.  However it was his day off and he wasn't there.  I also needed to talk to operations manager, but he wasn't there too.  I'll just go on a Friday, when supposedly all of them will be at work.  I must say I feel liberated leaving that job, I think working there affected me in ways that I'm not used to.  Like I used to be very patient, these days however, I'm not.  So it was for the best, plus I had this gig coming up already, just thought I would stay till the "last" week.  So basically I'm going to lazy out for the next two weeks, go out with friends and put more time into going to the gym.  Although, I'm going to the gym everyday, now I can dedicate more time to it.  I also need to start looking for the new apartment.  And get ready for Dana, whatever that means, hahaha.  Ok I'm going to hit gym again.

						   What an interesting turn of events today at work.  I've always thought about handing in the name tags and quitting, but today I was asked to hand them in.  The irony...  Anyways, so at 5PM, my scheduled time to leave, I tell the guys at the tech shop that I'm leaving since its my time to go.  About two minutes later, Jenny tell me that I'm scheduled to work until 6PM.  Now that's odd, because I specifically remember that I'm scheduled to leave at 5pm.  So I go ask my boss, when was this change in schedule, since I was oblivious to this change.  He tells me because I came in late today, I have to make up for that time.  Very logical, but I let out a chuckle, because it reminded me when I did work over the schedule time, the operations manager would be on my neck about overtime.  I guess my boss took the chuckle to the heart, and took great offense.  He said I left out a smart ass laugh or sometime like that.  All I wanted was to ask about this "change" in schedule, and if he wouldn't just snap, I would probably stay till 6pm, because he is right.  And that's what I wanted to know, an explanation.    He mentioned how I had many sicks days, but, I quite didn't understand that, since I only called in sick twice in 6 months.  I find that hardly calling in sick a lot.  After I explained that, he says I've been coming late lately, which is true, for the last past 3-4 days I've been late, but as per the same thing he was talking about I would stay over 6PM...  He said to hand in the tags if I really wanted to go, well and since it came to this point, where he mentions about handing in my name tags, I guess he really wants me to leave, and I think it was better for me to leave.  I mean, why would I stay when I'm unwelcomed? So I handed in my tags and left.  I was planning to leave in two weeks, but well, I guess another two weeks more of "vacation" till the next gig won't hurt.  No biggie, now I just have to go there sometime during this week to settle the remainder of my pay.

						   So me and Dana talked today about her coming to DC to the job interview, and why she believes she will be hired without a doubt.  And well, I agree with her, the requirements screams her name, and she is more than qualified with her impeccable record.  So she needs to move back to DC, well so basically I told her that me and Misha might be getting an apartment at Buchanam, because of the good memories from back in the days, and asked her if she wants to move in together when we decide about it.  I definately want to move out from my current apartment because I never get along with my brother, Misha is sick and tired of his ghetto basement in DC.  Dana told me that Buchanam might be a bit to far from DC, so maybe around Balston I found a better place, its near two metro lines for the Misha and Dana since they won't be driving, I really don't have a problem because I drive.  I read the reviews for it at it had one of the highest rating in Arlington.  The building seems nice and all utilities are included with bunch of anemities.  There is a mall nearby, so lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, plus two major groceries around the area.  The rent is affordable for a three bedroom apartment.  If everything falls through, this plan would be so nice.  I never really had a roommate except for my brother, but I don't count him as a roommate, living with family is a bit different.  I'm already excited about this.  Just need to talkt to Misha to see if he is ok with this too.  Also discussed some apartments chores already, haha.  I'll do gourmet cooking everyday, Misha and Dana will rotate the dishwashing detail! hahaha  Or if Misha doesn't want to do the dishes, the Misha will have to take care of grocery shopping!  Then of course the parties, to me, I would throw parties or dinner everyday, but that we will have to discuss..  This will be great!

						   Work today was so nice, there were barely any customers today, which means NO customer issues to deal with.  Just set on cruise control and let the time pass by.  Called Dana today, well she is coming here the week after this week.  I wish she could have come ealier, because well I won't be here for the weekend of that particular week, but oh well.  Then again, she is coming here because she will be doing an interview for a job here in DC, and if everything goes along well, she will be moving here, so I'll be able to see her again, after I come back from this job.  I fixed up my computer today, I had some parts that I needed to install, such as USB 2.0 for my camera and other USB devices.  Also got my Sony Clie cradle finally installed, I don't need to use the cables that came with it. Also I got a new video card ATI Radeaon 9800Pro, since my video card was running slow for my current computer.  I guess I'm just buying a lot of stuff before leaving the current work, because I will definately miss employee purchase scheme.  Today I just did a light workout (lifts) well because I was too lazy and maybe a bit tired from Friday night.  I really do need to get some good rest so I'm ready for this weekend!  Ok hitting the bed.

						   Friday night was a lot of fun, much more than I expect, and as I thought, Tiesto didn't let me down.  That guy just went nuts in the DJ booth.  He was jumping in the booth along with the crowd.  He even banged his head a couple of times against the wall!  So me and Misha took Alan to introduce him for the first time to the finer style of clubbing nightlife.  Needless to say, he had a blast, He already enjoyed this kind of music, since he loves Miami nightlife, but he was waiting for "something" more.  He was pumped to go, I mean we were all pumped up to go.  Taking him to Tiesto was a perfect intro.  By the end of the night he was like "God dude, this is soo good man,  too bad my legs are shot!"  I had the same problem.  The place was PACKED, actually, the tickets were SOLD OUT by 11:00PM, and that's pretty fucking early to be sold out for a place like Nation.  So because of that I could find NO place to sit down.  Also this was change of pace from my other clubbing nights.  Like when I go to Five or other places I'm always looking for girls to hit on, but when I get to Nation, I come for the music and dancing, sure if I get something, thats a bonus, but that's not the intention I go there for.  But then again girl issues always follow me, lately, I think...  So "the" girl incessantly called my phone while I was at Nation, text messages, voice mails and what not, to a point I decide to call her back to find out what the hell is going on. She tried to get in Nation, and because the tickets were sold out, she could not get in.  And my problem is?  None, she didn't call me before hand to plan anything, so I guess she got left out, but hey, I'm not going to chase her or anything.  If she wants something she better call me at my convenience.  Its not that I'm evil, but I already got burnt bad with her, so I'm not going to stress about her.  Yeah had some good times with her for the last two(?) months, but that is it, I'm all about having fun with her, but I'm not going to cross great lenghts to please her or anything.  So I told her, there is nothing I can do, but well will do tomorrow (saturday).  Well she called, but I was soo tired/sleeping from yesterday I didn't pick up ANY calls, six missed calls from her to be exact, and you know what I think about girls calling six times a day right?  PSYCHO!  She must be really pissed now.  But this is MY bad, because I told her I would do something with her today.  Well I guess I have to make up for it next weekend... :|  Overall I had a lot of fun, danced my ass off, I danced so much, that I lost 5 pounds just yesterday. LOL.  Next weekend, Paul Oakenfold and Armin van Buuren in DC.  Time to ROCK ON again!

						   Everyone knows that muscles rip apart when weight lifting and the process of healing the muscle is what causes the muscle growth.  All this is done one a microscopic level.  So there I was lifting weights when suddenly I hear a loud ripping sound coming out from my right arm and I immediately lose all the strenght and I feel a sharp pain.  What the hell!  That's just fucking sucks.  I wanted to maintain a constant discipline on weight lifting now I will only be able to do cardio...  Not a good sign for today.

						   I remember that there was a dinner at Busara with a bunch of people, after that we went to this bar/deck at hotel Savoy where Andrea's sister was staying over.  Now, I started drinking at the dinner, by the time I left the bar/deck, I pretty much don't remember anything.  I even forgot to take my camera!  Though I had my trusty phone camera, and well I took one picture at Carlos request.  So its here, upload because I know he will bitch about letting him having a copy.  But man, giving me an one dollah tip was low.  Professional photographer like myself get paid, and well... hahah. So I think we hit 18th Street area after it, not sure exactly what clubs/bar we went over to though.  Who knows, I don't even remember making it back home.  Well its morning, so its time to hit the gym again..   urlLink    Emma and Carlos&nbsp; urlLink

						   What the hell, so yesterday around 9PM I woke up with a call from my brother asking directions.  Supposedly, since I was sleeping, the "group" wanted to let me continue sleeping.  Oh well fuck the camping then.  Anyways, Alan called me and left a message on my voicemail inviting me to watch a movie, but well I was asleep, and by the time I got the message they were already in the movie theaters.  It's ok though, since I haven't been doing much lately, I got a lot of free time, and this allows me to hit gym twice a day, once in the day and once at night.  I'm extremely satisfied with that.  I began implementing whey protein as Dana suggested me a while ago, in a month or so I'll probably know if there is any positive results from that, or if its just a waste of money, because its 60 bucks per container of that powdery thingy.  On a funny note, my hands started to develop calluses, from all the weight lifting.   Who would have ever thought that my baby, bourgeois hand would ever develop calluses?  But then again, since being cut off from my parents financial help, I'm proletariat now... hahah.  Well its freaking Friday, I definately want to go out today, bling bling rockstar style.  Since it will be my last weekend before the gig in Illinois,  I just hope the crew is up for going out, because they have been flaky lately.  Wussies!  Then I need to get my shopping list for the trip/gig going, and then well need to be the host for Dana and Zeca next week.  Oh yeah and old article from BBC News, about this minister of Goa, India.   Some funny shit.  Here is the link  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3304983.stm

						   After after gym yesterday, the old ladies started to annoy me, so I went to my room and locked myself in there.  Decided to play Civ3 to pass the time. It's not like I felt leaving my room anyways.  So today I'm getting ready to hit gym again, but early.  My brother said that we might go camping with the "old" ladies.  Yeah I know what I said ealier, but if they are paying all the expenses for the camping I might go.  Just by reading Sodo's blog about doing hick outdoors stuff, make me want to go.  I just hope I don't get harrassed there...  That ass Sodo still has to send me my pictures from my trip to Mongolia.  I knew if he takes the pictures, he wouldn't send me, not because he doesn't want to, but because he is a lazy ass.  But I didn't have much of a choice, my camera uses those advantix films and well I could NOT find any store selling advantix film back in Ulanbataar.  I looked through like eight store and NOTHING.  Sigh, now I'm still waiting for Sodo to send the pictures, it's been about a year...  Next time I go, no more of that shit, I'm taking my digital camera, so whatever I shoot I will have the pictures IMMEDIATELY.  Mongolia were good times, I did a lot of hick/outdoors stuff, but when done with good friends it fun.  God, it was an unique type of fun, and I don't mean just the hick stuff, I mean the clubbing and stuff.  HAHA.  Man I wonder how is that "slut" I met, she was kinda hot, too tall though.  hahah  Anyways, so I'm going to hit the gym about now.  I'm really excited about going to the gym in the last couple of months, because I'm getting the results of the hard work.  The only clothing that fits me now, somewhat, are my shirts.  None of the pants fits on me anymore, the only pants that fits me, is the pair of jeans that I got from my brother.  The shorts I'm using for the gym are too big, so I have to wrap a belt around the shorts...  Looks weird...  I remember a couple of days ago, when I went to eat dinner with Misha, and wasn't dressed to go out, I had to borrow a shirt from Misha.  HIS SHIRT FITS ME!  Sure it was a "tight" fit, but when you are "buff" it looks good.  But it wasn't tight as in "its too small".  I mean MISHA'S SHIRT!  MISHA'S SHIRT!  You all know how small are Misha's clothes.  I was like "Woah, WTF, Misha's shirts fits me!"  Like I said before I haven't lost any weight, and I was a bit puzzled at first, but then I relized the reason I didn't lose any weight is basically the fat got replaced by muscles, I mean my waist is much thinner now, got no belly, but same weight.  I just need to need to lose a bit more fat and work out my back muscles, then I'll be satisfied.  Oh yeah, Urosh, if you are reading this, happy birthday dude!

						   Man my brother and his older girlfriend... So right now the apartment is packed with "old" ladies, his girlfriend's friends.  Lost my appetite and didn't eat dinner.  Misha had invited me for dinner and drinks, but I've been going quite nuts on the credit card so I decided to hold on for a while, but damn I wish I had gone out from here.  So I hit gym  for a total workout, pretty much like everyday...  One hour of weights and 20-30 minutes of cardio.  I began working on the back muscles couple of days ago, since it not a muscle that is used on a daily basis, it hurts like a bitch.  My childhood friend Zeca will be coming to NYC to visit his sister this coming weekend, he will drop by in DC to visit me for one day on Tuesday.  Dana will be here around the same time.  I wish they would both come on a weekend, but well, too bad.  I'm really looking forward on seeing them again.  It's been about a year last time I've seen them.

						   Well as probably you noticed I haven't been updating on a daily basis, mainly because I'm lazy, but I told I would be lazy till the next job, so screw you! :P  Friday I don't remember what I did, probably went out with Misha, Carlos and Alan, and probably went to 18th street area, but don't quote me on that. These days weekends has been hazier and hazier.  I do remember Sunday though, I remember while bar hopping we got stranded under a ledge because it suddenly started to pour a lot of rain.  Our cars were parked really far away,  that basically screwed up the night.  I didn't feel like going out soaked.  Anyways been going to gym everyday like usual, but I still can't lose the fat around my waist, I got no belly or anything, it just the sides.  Upper torso and the arms are "buffer" than before still that fat around my waist is just plain weird.  Cardio and weights, and no results there!  I will have to try something else...

						   I know Dana will kill me, but this place is defacto land of the corn.  As you peruse the pictures below, that's the impression you get arriving here.  You are greeted with miles and miles of cornfields.  I'm not saying it's anything bad, it just different...  Also I was told by Wakako that the corns are twice their height because its genetically modified.  Isn't that just a bit too freaky?  It sounds like it came straight out from a sci fi movie.  Would you eat a genetically modified corn?  Anyways, yesterday Dana and Wakako picked me up at the airport because Dana's mother took her car to Missouri, so she is carless. lol.  Ok we came to Dana's apt and I dropped my stuff and then we went on to Wakako's place.  We had some stuff there, and it was nice...  Specially the macarronni and cheese thing...  with chopsticks???  hahah. So, musical recording, footages, hmm, Pablito Clay, blogging, macarronni and cheese, naps...  It was very interesting!  Ok so Dana got her job, and we were supposed to celebrate at the restaurant Wakako is working.  My rookie ass fell asleep at Wakako's couch and we weren't able to go there, and I really wanted some sushi, supposedly its the second best Japanese restaurant in the area.  I just want to thank Wakako for being so nice.  Thanks for picking me up at the airport, and inviting me to your place. Thanks!  urlLink    And miles and miles of... cornfields.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    And more and more and more.....genetically modified corn.. fields...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    As you see, it's an endless cornfields.&nbsp; urlLink

						   I know I'm not being too chronological, but I didn't get a chance to write down my trip over here.  &nbsp;  So anyways, probably you know that most of my flights are full of issues, and this flight to Iowa had its problems as well.&nbsp; It was not bad like the last time where I had to stay in Chicago for a day.  &nbsp;  While I was doing my laundry Thursday night, I laid down for a bit on the sofa because I was so tired.&nbsp; Well I end up waking up 4AM in the morning and my flight departs 6AM.&nbsp; So I still haven't gotten back my laundry, I still had to pack, shower and dress up.  &nbsp;  After I'm done with everything, and I'm ready to leave, it's about 5AM...&nbsp; I tell my brother that I'm ready to go, since he will be taking me to the metro, just because he is too lazy to take me directly to the airport(so many times I took him to the airport...).&nbsp; He did take me to the metro, however metro doesn't open till 6AM.&nbsp; So I ask my brother to take me to the airport, and surprisingly he did, although he was like "Do I have any choice?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Well yes he does, he can simply decline my request and leave me stranded there, that would be so him...&nbsp;  Now we are heading the opposite direction from the metro, and the clock is ticking.&nbsp; I get to the airport at 5:30AM, I run to the check in counter to get my boarding passes and to check in one of my bags.&nbsp; This part was relatively fast, although I was expecting huge lines, there were none.&nbsp; Then I hit the security check point, well that's where everything gets delayed.&nbsp; What time I had there is pretty much gone by the end of it.&nbsp; Why must they ALWAYS check my boarding pass with the "red"&nbsp; marker?&nbsp; So they see my camera box and thinks that it is some sort of laser gun that will be used to murder the flight crew...&nbsp; Yeah I'm about to do that, not with the flight crew though, but the security check crew...&nbsp; They ask a bunch of stupid questions, any of which my reply was a 'hmm" or just a nod.&nbsp; Please just go ahead and search through my stuff so I can go catch my flight, I'm late as is and I don't want your small talk.&nbsp; After the security check I'm flying down the terminal towards the gate, and I hear the boarding lady(?) call my name "Mr Sung Park the flight is about to&nbsp;depart and this is your last call."&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear that on every flight I take, so in a sense that didn't manage to scare me or anything, though I wish one day I don't get called again.&nbsp; Get on time like every other passenger...  &nbsp;  Once we land in Chicago, where all the connecting flights gets screwed up, I was pretty sure something would happened to my flight, but nothing happened, and I was a bit puzzled at first.&nbsp; While waiting for my flight I got a bit hungry and bought a "meal" at Mickey D,&nbsp; and in honor of the movie "Super Size Me"(movie with Dana) I bought the sausage/egg/ham McGriddles.&nbsp; While eating at the wait area, this old lady took the sit right beside me, which at the moment I didn't take notice, but when I could see right at the side that she was staring at me, I lost all my appetite.&nbsp; Sure older ladies are nice, but not when they are like 60 years old.&nbsp; Of course unless you are our resident elder ladies gigolo Misha. Once this lady starts to make her "cues"&nbsp;I just dropped everything&nbsp;I had in the trash right by my side and left...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ok, so I boarded the plane, and only then there was something screwed up with my flight.&nbsp; The plane would not take off.&nbsp; " Capitain speaking, I apologize for the delay, but for safety reasons we will stay grounded until the maintenance crew make sure the plane is ok to fly."&nbsp; Wow thanks cap' I really needed to know that the plane is/was not safe to fly.&nbsp; Flight got delayed but I got here to Iowa, finally...  &nbsp;  Well I just don't have the time to post more, but I will later.  &nbsp;  Oh behave kids.

						   God... Ok I acted really stupid in front of this girl, but I can't really say it my fault.&nbsp; You know what I'm talking about...&nbsp; Those really rare girls that are really hard to find... because they are so unique that I have no words to describe her.&nbsp; I'm not talking about being physically hot girl(although she is), its just that this girl is so smart, so witty and funny, that makes you think you are so dumb not worthy kinda.&nbsp; I felt like a little boy with nothing to say.&nbsp; I hate to admit it, but I got so freaking intimidate by her, its just something...&nbsp; I acted like a damn fool with nothing to say.&nbsp; That's how witty she is, after you hear what she has to say, you have nothing to add to it, or at least you feel scared to say something stupid.&nbsp; The list of her qualities doesn't stop there though, it just goes on and on.&nbsp; BUT, yeah, girls like her are taken, sucks eh?&nbsp; If a girl is that good, they will always be taken...  &nbsp;  Let me just say, she is not the average&nbsp;bimbo you would find in college, nor even in the more eclectic type/crowd.&nbsp; Like I said she is just so different, she is real something, very unique.&nbsp; Well I'm gonna stop here before I act more stupid than I sound right now.  &nbsp;  Anyways, my USB memory stick reader, broke the AC power limit of Dana's laptop so I won't be able to upload any pics for now...

						   Why oh why god?&nbsp; Why can't I just have a normal relationship with my brother...  &nbsp;  Anyways I'm so tired!  &nbsp;  So past Sunday I didn't sleep, and went straight to the airport Monday to pick Dana up.&nbsp; I'm that kind of friend that just sleep through...&nbsp; Ask Dana how many times back in GTown days I would tell her that I would meet her and Ellie for lunch and end up not showing up nor making "the" call, just because I overslept...&nbsp; At one point, even when I would tell them I would go, they would not take it seriously.&nbsp; That was so embarrassing.&nbsp; My mother tells me the reason I sleep like that is because I have a "clear conscious", I have no "regrets".&nbsp; Well, that's sound nice, but I definitely wouldn't tell someone the reason I STOOD THEM UP is because I OVERSLEPT AND I HAVE NO REGRETS ABOUT IT, MY CONSCIOUS IS CLEAR ABOUT IT.&nbsp; definitely not a good way to get points...&nbsp; Any how many times I missed my own flights...&nbsp; And let the truth to be told, the reason I missed my flight to Beijing last summer was because I did not wake up on time... However, conveniently, Isabel storm was canceling many flights that day so I used that as MY excuse...&nbsp; sigh.  &nbsp;  Bleah, ok so before I wander off too much, so the reason I didn't sleep was because I was too scared of just leaving Dana stranded at the airport.&nbsp; And I know from experience how bad it is when you are stranded away from home (NYC).  &nbsp;  Ok so after picking up Dana basically it was four straight days of going out, drinking (parents would get appalled, heh).&nbsp; And of course we would hit gym every morning.&nbsp; Ok me and Dana would take naps, but that doesn't help much when its continuous "band aid" for the lack of sleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today I left Dana at the airport and just like everyday I hit the gym.&nbsp; I must say today was extra hard.&nbsp; Then I had to drive to DC again to make a deposit into my brother account(best time to ask me favors is when I'm asleep because I will accept ANY requests, so girls, take note!).&nbsp; Come back, clean apartment, from the mayhem that was Dana's stay here.&nbsp; And now I have to wait for the laundry so I can pack for Iowa.&nbsp; It's 11:23PM.&nbsp; My flight to Iowa is 6AM in the morning, so I have to wake up around 3:30AM to 4:00AM.&nbsp; Did I sleep yet?  &nbsp;  The girls in Iowa better be really hot, you know, keep me interested or I'm afraid I'm just going to sleep for the whole weekend, and put an expensive sleep at that. HAHAHA

						   Today I finally realized what I was doing wrong on my workout sessions(ala Dana saying my arms are too thin....).  &nbsp;  My first problem was that I was overdoing weights, I wasn't giving enough rest for the muscles to grow.&nbsp; Which makes a lot of sense since I work all muscle everyday twice a day...  &nbsp;  Then also I was working some wrong muscles.&nbsp; After my brother showed me some exercises that isolate the workout on a particular muscle, I felt how much work was still needed.&nbsp; I was lifting a mediocre 5 pounds on those "hidden" muscles.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But oh well, everyday learning something new.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyways, I have to do some laundry and pack for Iowa tomorrow.  &nbsp;  Behave kids.

						   Ellie's mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm hoping it will be nothing major since the chances of of recovering is much better if caught early on, and I think that's the case.  At times like these I feel helpless.  I definately want to do something, but I don't know what to do.  Ellie, I just want to let you know that I'm thinking about you and the well being of your mom/family!  Do not worry about not being able to come here for the summer, if needs to be we will go to Japan*.  Plus I wouldn't be here in August anyways... :P  Anyways, My best wishes and a speedy recovery to your mother.  I'm sorry Ellie...

						   I DO remember some stuff from yesterday, but, it is mostly from before getting really drunk...  So everyone knows in DC when there is a guy and and a girl talking, your are a prime target for those people trying to sell roses...  So I decide to buy one for Dana, and it was soo embarassing.  I still don't know what's my ATM pin number, thus I rarely carry any cash with me.  So I had to ask Dana for cash so I could use that money to buy her the rose...  I just need to go to a corner and shoot myself!  And so... One of the funniest thing was to make Alan believe that Dana was one of the girls he met in one of the numerous prowls into Five.  Ok, so Dana calls Alan and identify herself as "Sarah" on his voicemail.  She leaves the standard "Oh I was so glad to meet you that night, and hopefully we will see each other again today, maybe"  message.  Now this would totally work because well, when we go to Five, the amount of people we meet is just too much to remember next day.  Alan specially, since he is relentless in his persuit for girls.  So Dana left him a "sexy"  message and he scrambled to figure out "WHICH"  girl it was from Five.  He checked Dana's phone number on the internet and found out it was from Iowa... Ok so he calls back, but supposedly Dana did not pick up the call and ends up going to her voicemail which off course says its Dana's voicemail...  If it wasn't for that, he would have definately fallen for that.  Like I said the key point was to make him think it was one of the girls from Five, which evidently he would not remember which girl it would have been.  Anyways, so after we come back from partying yesterday, I don't really know what I talked with Dana about, but I noticed today that I bought a ticket to Iowa.  I'm leaving on Friday...  Hmm I've been using a lot of money lately and well, if I was sober at the moment, I would probably had not purchased this ticket, but now its too late... HAHAHA.  But it's all Dana's fault, its her bad influence.

						   Ok so yesterday was hectic. Well not really, it's just that when I'm with Dana I tend to drink too much too early.  By then, when we went to Japan Inn, I was almost half asleep.  So me, Misha and Dana came back to my place for some wine and to watch a movie.  God do these people ever stop drinking? This is reminiscence of Iowa where Dana insisted we start drinking early and I pass out before the night...So before hitting the bed I went to gym, although, it was really late I'm trying not to miss gym.  So I went to gym, like 12AM and Misha went back to his place because of "work" the next day. Ellie is missing... Well I had to post this picture, because its too freaking hilarious. hahah  urlLink    Marilyn Monroe, aka Dana.&nbsp; urlLink

						   So my brother's laptop doesn't seem to take my camera memory reader.  This means that my camera is useless.  Sure I did manage to grab two pictures out of the memory stick, but that was luck.  I still got my phone camera, but you know how they are.  Anyways it's not like there is much to shoot here anyways.  What more pictures of cornfields?  I rather look the paint dry.  So its Saturday, I should probably waking up at this time after a long Friday night clubbing.  Then getting ready to go out in a couple of hours again.  I should be making calls too...  But here I am, in the middle of nowhere, working seven days a week.  I do have choices like Chicago or Iowa City, but I wouldn't be able to stay out much anyways.  Probably the only hours I have to rest will be wasted on driving to some town, and driving right back.  Waste of gas, waste of time, waste of money...  The worst thing though, is that I miss people, my friends.  Here I get no calls, don't get to see them, don't get to do nothing.  Sucks eh?  Thought I'm so busy with work it seems that time is passing real quick, which is good, but then once I'm done, probably 2/3 of my pay will go to credit card, car repair, rent, bills in general which is bad.. hehe.  Then there is the apartment issue with Misha and Dana, since I'll be "late" for about half a month.  So I'm not really sure how this will work out.  Dana said she will work something out, let see her wave the magic wand.  She does perform miracles, I think, right??  Ok Wakako seems to be posting in our "exclusive club" blog, so I'm happy.  I know she doesn't like computer? Or doesn't have time to post, so any post from her is something to cherish.  At least I just want to know what this wonderful person I met is up to. Keep it up Wakako.  Now I'm going to lift some weight, do some minor jogging and hmm, SLEEP.  Behave kids.

						   While driving back to my hotel, and looking through the cornfield, there were many barns.  For a moment I thought about how great would it be just to get away from all the hectic life from the city.  All that noise, all those blinding flashing lights, all the sirens, all the loud people, all the cell phone ringing...  What have we here in the middle of nowhere?  I guess fresh air, nice landscape(non existant in DC these days), howdy hospitality, cozy diners.  Yeah it not much, but simple things in life are taken for granted or forgotten with time.  Maybe I should try to find a job around here, and rent a house at first, then buy one.  Who knows, I might enjoy living this kind of life.  Wake up early in the morning, prepare fresh coffee, make breakfast with organic stuff and read newspaper maybe.  Hmm then I would drink a pint of vodka, along with a couple of pills and get the hell out of here!  I'm too of a city boy to be stuck up here, not saying here is bad, it just not me.  Though, I'm sure I could spend sometime in places like these, it definitely  takes the edge off from living in a big city.  Just think as summer house or something, coming here just to rest and chill.  Chill; something I haven't done in a while.  Anyways, I don't know what people are up to, WHY? Because they never update their blogs or don't have one.  The only person I know what she is up to, is Dana, she is VERY BUSY packing. hahaha.  Good luck with negotiating your pay Dana, just in case I go broke you can shelter and feed me.. hahaha  God nothing to do, this sucks.  Hey, by the way, there is a skydiving thing here in De Kalb, if anyone is up for it, drop by.  Ellie, let us know how you are hanging there in Japan, and how is your mother recovering.  I hope everything is going well for you and your mother.

						   Well I have to apologize, apologize to Dana.  I think I came on a bit harsh on her.  But like she said, I'm a bitter, bitter man. HEH.  So I'll retract what I said before.  Plus its hard to not to forgive her, she so damn adorable.  Not only I forgave her, now I'm apologizing her for being too harsh. The truth is, I love her to death, she is one of the most amazing people I've ever met.  Even if she had never called me to apologize, probably I wouldn't be mad at her for more than one week.  It's hard to describe or the English language just lack the words to describe a person like her; only people that have met Dana would understand.  She just got such an amazing personality, cute, sweet, witty, uh this list will never end... Anyways she would cast a charm spell on anyone, even girls.  Check all her friends, they love her to death.  Ok there are the occasional bitches, but bitches are bitches.  So she called to apologize and when she spoke with the "I'm sorry" voice, I immediately felt bad about telling that I was mad at her.  After talking to Dana, she passed the phone to "someone".  It was Wakako, and I was suprised just as her who was on the other side of the phone.  I just didn't realize Wakako was with her, I just hope I didn't act like a little wuss, I acted like a wuss already when I first met her...  She tell me to come visit them since I'm so close to them, right, I might, but I asked her what they had to offer me in Iowa, although I was expecting something like Sophos from the island of Lesbos, it was something else I will not mention here. Heh.  Well regardless, I would definitely visit them if I could; two gorgeous, sweet, witty girls, what is there not to like.  I might be able to visit after work, maybe I could drop by Iowa City and then visit Steve at this lake house before flying back to DC.  I don't know yet, I will know in two months and a half.  I need to pass out for work tomorrow, you lazy people in Iowa, doing god knows what this late.  Hmm Sophos...  hahah.  Behave kids.

						   Ok I gotta admit this work is harder than I thought, however it's a good life lesson experince type thing.  Been raised as a spoiled brat, this should bring a bit of humility to my personality.  By the time I leave this job I should be much more buff, although I eat junk all the time here, and get to smoke a whole lot more.  Though I'm still lifting weights after work, trying to keep my gym routine regardless of how hard it gets.  Me and my brother we took the bench and bunch of weights to work out here while two months away.  Cardio is being harder though, because of the freaking impact it just screws up my back.  Going slowly though, in a week or so I should be able to to handle jogging better.  Like Dana said, humans were not made to run.  I'm going to try to find a bookstore because the work is really boring, its mindnumbing, there is no intellectual challenge there. But I really can't expect any kind of intellectual stimulation from this type of work... hahah.   I need to read something or my brain cell will just commit sapuku.  hahah  Yes Dana, I'm mad at you, you've been acting nonchalant towards me since I got back from Iowa.  I'm not asking for anything, but since I got back whenever I'm talking to you you are like " I'll be right back" or "Hold on." twenty seconds into the conversation. Then you never return.  If you are going to do that, that's fine, at least let me know you are not returning so I don't have to wait like a fool.  It's just plain rude.  Yes I know you are busy, so am I.  I work 12 hours a day every day now remember?  I still manage to find time to update my blog to keep my friends updated of what I have been up to. Not going to say anything though, you do what you think is ok, I mean, it's your time, not mine.  So regarding visiting here, well Steve might drop by on his way to Chicago, not sure which weekend though, but since I work everyday its not like I really have the time.  But I'll get to hang out better with him once I go to his lake house after the job.  So Dana it's really up to you if you want to drop by, I know Iowa City is only 90 miles away, that's like what? Only 1:30 hours away? But since you are so busy, maybe it's not worth the time.     urlLink    This picture is strikingly familiar, like from couple of days ago... (hotel window with zoom)&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Nothing else, other then the cornfields. (hotel window)&nbsp; urlLink

						   Midwest is an odd place, at least to me.  This place is so weird...  First lets start with weather; there was a thunderstorm earlier today, and "tornado weather", and there sun, then rain, then sun, then rain.  Yes, in that particular order...  On top of that when there was sun, it was REALLY hot.   I feel dehydrated from sweating so much from this heat.  Ok after work we decide to hit the "town" to buy food at Wallmart, yes you heard it right, WALLMART groceries...  In there everyone is dressed up as if its like a high fashion mall or something.  For crying it out loud, it's a freaking WALLMART.  One thing that did impress me though is that it has the "cozy small" town look.  Maybe when I'm old and tired of metropolitan life, I will move here.  So I was thinking on what to do on the weekend, there is Chicago like two hours away or Iowa City 90 miles away.  I wish St Louis would be closer though, because I rather go there.  Well anyways, I said I would upload some pictures, but I'm lazy so maybe some other time.

						   Ok so Misha convinced me to keep my blog updated for now since I won't have ANYTHING to do for two months other than surf then net and watch TV.  The drive here was was pretty smooth, since I thought we would get lost a lot, but we didn't get lost once.  However it was a bit boring, it was a 13 hours drive, thanks god I had a laptop and my cell connected to the laptop to surf the internet.  Gadgets rules.  The more we went towards the west, the more crop fields we popping up on the horizon, its ironical that I had just gotten back from Iowa City two days ago and now I'm only two hours from there.  The hotel I'm at right now is much better than expected, because I thought it would be a REAL ghetto place.  The area sucks though, its cornfields everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE.  Like if you people could have a look from my room window all you see is cornfield in ANY direction.  I'll post some picture tomorrow.  There is NOTHING here, the grocery store is 10 miles from here, there is no bar, not mall, no movie theaters, there is NOTHING, only cornfields.  Even gas station is five miles from here.  It seems the work will be rough, I saw the work site and god damn, the place is huge, I'm sure it will take more than two months to do it, which will screw up my plans in DC of moving in with Dana and Misha.  But since the last two days made me reconsider about this, so this actually worked out for the best.  Steve might drop by next weekend from St. Louis since its about 2-3 hours from here.  Since I'll be really bored out of my mind here with nothing to do, it a nice gesture from him.  And after the job I will drop by at his lake house before heading to DC.  Since me and my brother came in one car(his car), thus why I can't go visit my friend, Steve will pick me up here and take me to his lake house, and after that he will take me to a major metropolitan area, such as St. Louis, so I can get a flight back to DC.  It will be nice to spend some time at Steve's lake house after a two months of non stop work, and he always talked about his lake house ever since we've known, so I guess its about time I go visit his lake house.  Then once I get back to DC I'll have to start looking for apartments because I'm really desperate to move away from my brother.  Depending on the the rent I will even have to try to get roommates.  I would like to thank Misha for the huge favor he will be doing for me while I'm here in the middle of nowhere.  Thanks dude, I really appreciate it.  I'll post some pictures of cornfields tomorrow.  On a funny note, I got the following message on my tickle network message inbox. "Subject: Good Day! « previous | next »  Message:  Hello! I have been seeking for my match for 2 days here and decided to write you, I hope you are not against! Sorry, I do not know how to start, but I feel you will be interested to know me better as I do. Should I write you letters this way, or we will start our correspondance through the private e-mail. I can give you my provate e-mail adress: julia_m@mail333.com. If you are really interested please write me! Thank you, honestly yours, July."  Due to its timming, it seems Alan is trying to get me to revenge the prank we tried on him, or it looks like one of the russian bride scam thing or maybe its for real.  I shall investigate...

						   Well I guess I have to give this blog a proper burial.  Ok the reason I'm killing this blog is because like I mentioned previously, I'm pretty much the only one posting lately, and please understand that I'm not saying anyone else should update their blog because of me.  But I really don't see a point on updating this blog when I spend time of my day entertaining everyone and I don't even get to see what others are up to because they don't update theirs.  I want to make it perfectly clear that under no circumstances I'm trying to force you guys to update your blogs.  There are many reasons why you guys don't update you blogs and all of them are valid, and I think so is mine.  Ive been blogging since December 2003, so rest in peace.  Feel free to peruse the archives!

						   Well gym was hectic.  I'm so damn tired from it, really.  I mean, some people go to the gym to be healthy, some go to the gym to look nice, and I'm one of those that goes to look nice.  I smoke, drink way too much caffeine.  What kind of person have a smoke right after gym?  That's me...  If I went to gym to be healthy, fine, but I'm just being too superficial, which is definitely not me.  So when I relaunched this blog after the accidental deletion a couple of months ago, I intended to motivate my friends to start their own blogs and keep them updated so we could always know what each one of us were up to.  So it worked at first, a couple of them started blogging.  Didn't last long though, by now, basically it's pretty much me alone entertaining all of them, ok sure, Dana somewhat keeps hers updated as well.  I'm not blaming them or anything, some are busy and some are just not really into blogging, totally understandable.  So I really don't see a purpose on keeping up with this blog.  Anyways, I was planning on posting something grand for my last blog entry, but I'm too tired to think about anything else.

						   While Dana was working Friday night, the boys went to this bar where she works at.  Needless to say when guys go out and drink, we get stupid, then we pass around the camera and random pictures are taken, then we offer to sell the same picture for $5, and we wooh the girls.  Then, next day, we have some random pictures in the camera which we don't really remember.  Isn't that just a bliss?  Of course, unless your girlfriend finds out...  Only the first picture was taken by me, I have no idea who took the other pictures.     urlLink    I hate to be superficial, but DEFINITELY, not the Iowa's finest...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Hmm...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Hmm 2.....&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Hmm 3....&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Hmm 4....&nbsp; urlLink

						   I did get called by the boarding lady(?) again, because of the quick smoke/security/30mins for transit thing issue.  And the plane did not take off straight away for some odd reason(the odd reason is that Chicago O'Hare airport is  the North American Bermuda Triangle for planes, flights go missing or delayed, or even cancelled, ALL THE TIME over there...).  WHY ARE YOU BLARING MY NAME ALL OVER THE AIRPORT (as in, hey this guy Sung Park is the ASS CLOWN that is always delaying everyone's flight type annoucement)IF YOU ARE NOT "REALLY" TAKING OFF.  It no wonder airlines are in trouble.

						   Well I just got home from the airport and god, my brother had to be an ass again.  He told me he would freaking pick me up at the airport, so I call him asking where he was.  He was at home asleep, that where he was.  Jesus, so I call Alan asked a huge favor to pick me up.  I know these guys been out for the DC Saturday night so I knew calling 11AM in the morning would be a huge task.  Nonetheless, my friends are more reliable than my own brother, as you probably should know by now.  At the Chicago airport I made quick run outside for smoke, because they only scheduled 30 mins for transit time (stupid people)for me.  On the way back in I had to go through security checkpoint and once again those ASSES had to act like ASSES about my camera.  Sure my camera does not have the conventional camera looks, but c'mom, it has a freaking lens at the front, flash and a shutter button.  You don't have to be Einstein to figure that out.  But I got the "What is this?" Which I immediately replied with "Obviously, photography is not a hobby of yours."  The lady said "Sir, could you just tell me what is this?"  SIGH, ok so I told her it was a camera, but I was so sure she would have picked that up....  THESE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTING AMERICA FROM TERRORISTS?  What a waste of MY TAX DOLLARS.  The flight was fine, except I was crammed in between two girls, however, they were not the best looking.  I know I'm being so freaking superficial, but in the plane is not a good place to actually get to know the person and get to know their personality.  The captain of the plane was being smartass all the time.  It was funny at first but, after a while you are thinking, well just fly the damn plane.  "Captain speaking, once again, the technology and the science allowed a safe flight from Chicago to DC." Well duh..  "Captain speaking, federal regulations mandate that all passenger flying to National Airport must remain seated 30 minutes prior to landing, in any case, we will have to divert the plane to a different airport or we will get shot down."  Gee, what am I supposed to say to that, a CAPTAIN of a major airline is busting out jokes, that transpire a lot of professionalism.  I'm that much more confident about the flight knowing that an assclown is piloting this metal tube.  Departure from Iowa was hard for me, ok first because I will miss Dana, but it always the same issue when leaving Dana/Iowa.  She thinks I HATE Iowa, granted, I do like to bust out a couple of jokes and tease Dana, but Iowa is alright.  Plus the main reason I go to Iowa is not to enjoy corn harvesting or cow tipping, but I go there to VISIT DANA(and something else hahah).  But yeah, Dana's is always so caring, nurturing, and just so adorable that is her nature to care this much.  Thus why I'm ok even when issues arises.  Plus I had a blast meeting Dana's best friend, Wakako, supposedly she made a music video(yeah she is that artistic)of us and I would definitely want to have a peek at that.  Based on the footages I "think" she got from me, I'll be really embarrassed.  Now she got something to blackmail me if she ever needs to...  Well Dana got the job in DC so she will be moving back here so I'll get to see her again in two months.  For me, I'll have to freaking DRIVE all the way to Aurora, Illinois tomorrow... Hectic huh?  Yeah I still have to do more laundry, pack clothes, go shopping for stuff I might need for my two months stay in Illinois.  Supposedly Dana will be in Missouri when I'm done with Illinois and I'm "supposed" to visit her there, or she will met me in Illinois.  Ok I need to hit the gym.  Ellie, if you are reading this, even in Iowa I was thinking about you and your family, while I was having mad fun cow tipping, corn harvesting and posing for music videos.  I sent you an email but it went through Dana's GMail account for some reason, so that "email" was from me, not Dana. lol

						   Well it seems Steve will drop by here tomorrow, Saturday.  Well it's not like he can spend much time here since both of us are rather busy with work, specially me, since I don't have days off.  But its a nice change in this rather boring routine, plus its a nice gesture from him.  I appreciate that a friend is coming this far to visit me.  Work is getting really hard, specially since its so physically exhaustive and I get no days off.  Everyday I get a bit tired but you never really recuperate...   Twelve hours shift, everyday of the week for two months and half, non stop...  Uh.  I've been thinking on what I will do after this gig.  I'm still waiting for a reply from Citigroup, well its still about a month away, but I'm having second thoughts about it.  I'm thinking on traveling maybe to Mongolia again if that is possible with Sodo, or maybe go to Latvia.  But I am also thinking on just going away for a month somewhere, by myself.  Maybe some obscure country, I don't know.  I need to reassess on some long term goals, there is something missing in my life and I don't know what it is, it just a void that needs to be filled.  So maybe as soon as I hit DC, I'll be gone, unless that Citigroup job goes through, nothing much really to hold me in DC...  Since Sodo is building a new house, I guess going there and wrecking his new summer house would be in order, or Eugene and the Latvian chick. hahahah  Doso, no, those numbers are not rankings, they are how I call them... HAH. Girl from Iowa=1 Other girl from Iowa=3 Sungi=2

						   Sodo, no man, that's not the girl.  The Latvian "girl" is the one that contacted me through Tickle Network and like I said it might be one of those online bride scam thing. The amazing girl I met in Iowa is affectionatelly called 1.  I'm called 2 and the other amazing girl is called 3.  Hahah.  Dana I would call you if I didn't work 12 hours shift everyday, 7 days a week.  Also I don't think you get signal at Misery, Missouri.  Though, I'll shoot some beer cans with you AK-47 once I get to your place in Ozarks(sp?).  Also check you Gmail account for my email, I sent you an email of my mothers "interpretation"  of your bad dreams.  A follow up on the previous post, regarding being superficial, have you guys seens all these LOW CARB beer, meal, bread, candy, corn flakes, dildos, etc...  What the hell?  Everything is low carb!  And even those restaurants offering "Weight Watchers" or "Atkins" meal...  Even White Hen Pantry offer low carb made stuff...  All this because we are a bunch of superficial freaks.  Sure people like Dana do regular exercises because she is health concious, but a lot of people just do for the superficial aspect of it.  Is this all that there is to us?  I swear it sounds like back to the rule of the jungle.  We are supposed to go through all this ritual and appearances to project an image of power, be it through money or appearances to find a mate.  Things like these make you go hmmm.  We are just animals, we should be more though.

						   Oh god, I think I really screwed my arms.  I can feel my hands, but my arms are almost numb.  Maybe I should not have lifted any weights today.... One must be superficial whatever the cost right?  I know that's not me, I would care less about appearances.  Isn't it odd that when you are a kid you have dreams of building your own utopia, trying to change the world in a way where all those superficial and materialistic things would not have much meaning.  Then you preach to your friend about the evils of this kind of society, only to find out that, there is no other way around it, you must surrender yourself to this superficial and materialistic society.  What a way to have your perception in life thoroughly changed.  A dream coming to an end.  I need to make the money to live, I just hope I don't step on my way up like many people do.  None of the back stabbing that goes around...  I also workout lot lately, like couple of months already, but I hope I do not judge people based on appearances(Ok I do judge sometimes, but I really try not to, its a constant struggle, I'm not perfect.).  True, I say "Damn that girl is hot" but that doesn't mean that I judge how they are based on that, it more of a statement of a fact.  But many people DO judge and treat people differently based on how they look.  I mean my brother is a perfect example.  He think he is the hottest shit, he is really arrogant, and can't get enough of himself in the mirror.  That after he started to get body definition.  God I just hope I don't end up like him.  So many things you wish were different, so many things you wish you could have changed, so many things you wanted to have affected people around you in a good way, but those fond dreams just came crashing down... Maybe it just the dream of a naive kid back then, but a beautiful dream nonetheless.  The future is bleak for me, I'll just have to mold myself like everyone else, have that "perfect" job, "perfect" family, and a trail of evil left in the wake of those.  Ok no more of my non sense.  Anyways, I'm still extremely concerned about Ellie, there have been NO contact at all.  She might have been having a hard time, and trying to contact her incessantly might be annoying or not appropriate depending on the situation.  I just pray her mother is doing better since there is no way to know what's going on.  I even asked Dana (her best friend) about Ellie, and she doesn't have a clue as well.  I have this charm/talisman that some Chinese or Tibetan monk made it for me to protect me from "evil, bad things".  My mother is really into that kind of thing, so she was the one who looked for the monk to create it for me, supposedly it was specially made for me, but I'm sure it will work for others.  The a plastic pouch where there are couple of papers with some Chinese or Tibetan words to protect me.  Then the monk did a prayer on the paper before putting in the plastic pouch.  I told Dana already I will send her the talisman/charm for now so it might help her for her dreams, and then send it to Ellie in these difficult times.  I know this is a superticious things and might not even work, however, I've been carrying this for about 10-12 years(due to my mother's request) and I never really got hurt ever since.  Hopefully this might be able to bring some comfort to Dana's and Ellie's current situation.  2 misses 1 and 3. :(

						   Work was extremely exhaustive today.  I can't feel my arms.  At least I'm getting buff so I can fulfill my superficial needs.. bleah.  So I got an e-mail from "Julia" again.  The e-mail was so long, about 3 pages long that I didn't read it all.  The parts I read were very conflicting, because it seems canned, however she is not saying "I love you", "My family is poor","I need money", however she mentioned about how men in Latvia sucks, and that is a yellow flag, so I really don't know what to make out of it.  Pooh hoo, who cares...    Today I got a text msg from the "girl" asking where I was, since it has been a long time since I last talked to her.  She had left to Philly for work, and just when she was about to get back I left to Illinois.  I don't know if I should call her back, I kind of miss her...  Or maybe I'm just too lonely here, hehe.  Talked to my ex boss today and he gave me the gossip of what's going on back at CompUSSR with the crew, I was glad to have chatted with him, it's been a while.  His friend Ariane will be moving to DC in two weeks, so hmm I guess I'll get to meet her.  Last time she was here I had a rough night the previous day and well I slept the whole day the day after and didn't make it.  Ok, I need to lift weight(how? I don't know because I can't feel my arms, then I'm going to do some cardio.   Good night all.  urlLink    Uh Julia?&nbsp; urlLink

						   Well oops, I missed a post yesterday!  But hey, it not like my life is any interesting these days anyways.  Plus I get no e-mails or calls so it's not like I can gossip about others too.  God I'm a SAD SAD man.  Well anyways, I'm giving a serious of thought about doing skydiving here in Dekalb.  I tried to lose my extreme fear of heights by climbing a mountain once, in Brazil.  That was a disaster to say the least.  I freaked out once we got at the top and could not/was too afraid to "climb"  down.  It started by the guide telling me that he got a radio where he can contact the military airbase nearby, in case of emergency and helicopter would fly there.  Ok, once at the top, I told him to radio for a chopper, and that ASS told me that he never had a radio to begin with (What the fuck?), but I know there is a military airbase nearby, so he lied about the radio only.  The second time he got me was when he told me we had to go down through this really steep, make it a 90 degree incline.  There were no trails or anything, its a huge rock all the way down.  Anyways so maybe skydiving might help me lose this phobia, because it hate it.  I can't even freaking stand on an apartment balcony.  That's why I live on the first floor, not because its cheaper, as Dana though.  I can't even go to Eugene's balcony back in Buchanan without having my heart beat go up a notch.  Ok, I hope Ellie and her mother is doing better, there haven't been an e-mail reply or her blog's update for a while.  I'm pretty sure she is just too busy taking care of her mother.  All I can say is best wishes and a speedy recovery to your mother Ellie, and I miss you!  Dana has been having bad dreams, there are so many factors that could lead to this, specially because most of the times it something related to you in a unconcious level, so you never pick up whats causing it and change it, might take sometime to figure out.  Maybe a change in routine or people around you.  Also when getting a bad dreams, there is always a good chance that you will keeping having a bad dream for a while because you remember about that dream and somewhat perpetuates a bad dream streak.  I used to dream about falling from a tall building and hitting face first on the ground and dying, at that moment I would wake up.  The dream had such a profound scare/shock effect on me that I would dream about something similar for couple of weeks after that.   Hey Dana, anything, give me a call.  Kinda ironic she is a place called Misery, Missouri.  Are you sure there aren't a pet cemetery nearby? ;)  Misha, I got your message today, it doesn't have to be today, I was just checking about when they were arriving there in DC.  Just checking their "shipping" schedule.  Thanks a lot for this favor.  Oh yeah, Julia seems to be a scam, ever since I wrote back saying I had a friend in Riga, Latvia, "she" hasn't replied back yet.   HAHAH  Another Tatyana! Ok, weights and cardio.  Behave kids, specially 1.  haha 2 misses 1 and 3. haha

						   Not much to post here, except I'm really tired from work.  While driving to work today the "sunrise" was nice.  Unlike DC where you can't see the freaking horizon because of all the buildings.  Not many people are e-mailing or calling me, so I'm lonely here in Nowhere, Illinois.  Going to lift some weights and the do some cardio before hitting the bed. Good night all.   urlLink    Sunrise.&nbsp; urlLink

						   So the highlight of today was going to Wallmart.  Well ok, I need to buy some stuff such as toothpaste mosquito repellent and some other stuff.  Total was $78, and here I am trying to save money....  Near the Wallmart we found there is a movie theaters, well that's a relief, there is somthing to do in this town.  Me and my brother we might go one of these days.  Weather wise, it was really nice here, you know when the sun is hot, but there is a constant chill breeze to cool you off?  That's how it was today, very nice indeed; at least a nice change from the crazy weather I had here in De Kalb since I got here.  I think I mentioned before about this "JuliaM"  from the Tickle Network, where I said I thought it was one of those online bride scam thing.  Or it could just be Alan trying to get even with the prank we did on him.  Anyways so I replied through e-mail to her message.  And of course "she" replied back.  The email does indeed seems one of those online mail bride scam.  Though usually they immediately talk about marriage and how they "love" you when you haven't even met the person.  This one claims its nice to know/meet friends from abroad, so I don't know what to say except I need more replies from "her".  Sometimes after a couple of e-mail exchanges they will eventually say how they love you and want to marry you and ask to send money to papers/ticket to come to US to meet you....  HAH right, I don't have money to travel abroad myself, like hell I'm gonna send money to a total unknown person to travel here.  On the other side of the coin, she claimed she resides in Riga, Latvia, and guess WHO lives in Riga, Latvia?  That's right, my good friend Eugene.  I'm think on visiting him later this year anyways, so yeah I rather pay for MY trip to go to Latvia then pay someone to visit me.  HAHAHA.    Anyways can't just for now say "she"  is a scammer because I don't know yet, but I will know... hehehe  On different news, it seems that Misha is really working on his blogging skills.  He have been updating everyday since he actually started blogging.  Good to know what he is up to.  Big kisses to 1 and 3! You know who you are! hahahah    urlLink    Nice sunset in the land of the corn.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Julia from Riga, Latvia.&nbsp; urlLink

						   Since I started working the night shift, I'm having a bit of problem with free time.  I basically crash after I get back from work in the morning, and wake up probably two hours before work.  During those two house, I eat lunch, workout, check/update my blog, and email if the time allows.  It's been really hectic and I will probably have to cut down on email and blogging.  If I go a couple of days without blogging or replying to e-mails now you know what's going on.  Since I work night unsupervised, feel free to call me anytime, or emails my phone at guisun@sprintpcs.com but it has 160 characters limit.  Moving along, I wish I had more time to rest the body after a day of strenuous physical work, also have time to read some books.  I swear, twelve hour shifts basically leaves you with no free time, specially if you work seven days a week.  Dana, I'm flattered that you think I have very few flaws, but remember you said being perfect is bad?  I'm not saying that I'm perfect, but you know what I mean.  Also I do like to know my flaws so I can correct them, or at least try.  Isn't our lives a quest to achieve perfection, well not perfection but be the best you can be? Let me know when I "show"  these flaws, because some things are not so transparent to me even though its coming from me. :)  Anyways I miss you all, you know who you are.

						   Yesterday was a bit of pain at work, my brother could not stay awake and I ended up doing most of the work for the remainder of the night shift.  Outside was nice though, it was a beautiful night with a beautiful moon.  Bit chilly though...  Actually if was like Siberia, but it the right girls it could have been warmer.  Carlos seems to let go of his caveman ways and bought a cell phone, that's great, but buddy, if you send an email letting me now you FINALLY bought a cell phone, you could at least leave the number? hehehe.  Why do I think that reason you bought a cell phone was that Emma whipped you into buying one? hehe  But man, its great, it was such a pain to contact you, send me another email with your phone this time.  And by the way, how about you get internet at home too.  I know, baby steps...  Sodo seems to be getting busy lately, with work, something unheard of.  And it seems that like many other countries the newer generations are getting corrupted by vanity like the west.  I just find that party ridiculous.  I had a laugh.  That's when you have to play around with those stupid people.  I wish I was there just to blast those people with you.  Take advantage of stupid girls eh Sodo?  I would. HAHAHA.  Dana, I still haven't talked to my brother but I'll talk to him soon.  Ok I miss you all.  Another hard day of work coming up soon...   urlLink    Beautiful moon, just need a beautiful girl to be kissing under it...&nbsp; urlLink

						   After talking to Dana yesterday, it seems I'm an ass, I told her I would publicly acknowledge my "ASSness" if she could tell me any instances where I acted like an ass.  And so she did, and thus I'm unconditionally accepting my "ASSness"  title.  She poured with instances where I did act like an ass, the odd part is that I don't even recall doing them, however I know Dana would not lie to me.  How great is that you don't recall being an ass to the people you like?  I mean I can't even freaking do anything about if I didn't even remember what I did.  It feels horrible to know that for years when I thought everything was fine, was actually years of me being an ass an mean to people.  There is no excuse for that, and my only defense is that I truly do not recall those incidents, but its not a good excuse, I should have sensed that somehow.  Dana told me what I have done, I had doubts, but like I said she wouldn't lie to me but what I've done is really just not me, so maybe I still need to know myself better, that I'm actually capable of being an ass and hurt people.   Of course, feeling like an ass, I asked Dana if there was anything nice I've ever done to the "mystery" person.  I guess there were none.  So I don't want to put the person in the spotlight, but I want to publicly apologize for being an ass to you for many years.  I want to you to know though that, probably I was not really thinking through or I didn't really meant to be an ass to you all these years on purpose, if I had realized back then how horrible I was acting towards you, I was probably had not acted that way.  Next time you see me acting like that to you, slap me on the face so I get the point, and my friends let me KNOW when I'm acting like an ass at the moment, not couple of years later when there is NOTHING more I can to but apologize on a blog...  I'm truly sorry, and please accept my sincere apologies.  So moving on to other topics... Today I saw a map graph on lightning strikes throughout the state of Illinois from the thunderstorm yesterday night.  I have never seen so many lightning strikes in my whole life.  I hope just I don't get hit by one when I'm up there on the ceiling...  So the weather today is shitty, I was hoping for a nice cool sunny day, but can't expect that here in the Midwest, its either desert of Sahara or Haiti in hurricane season.  My night shift starts today, I hope I had enough sleep to last the twelve hours, or it's going to be painful.  Not that its not painful at the moment, its pain everyday. The major problem I'm having right now, is not the heat, nor the cuts and bruise, nor the extended hours of work, but my body and muscles are sore every single day.  Sure I do lift weights every other day, but that still should not make me sore, I even tried to not lift weights once for two days and I was still sore.  One of my ex boss called me today, he wanted to know how were things going out here in the Midwest.  He told me he had gone on a cruise in the Caribeans last week with this family.  That guy definitely needed a break, he works like a maniac. hehe  Anyways, so I told him that everything was going fine, that the work here was hard, but it was worth it, as in a life experience type thing, and also the money was better than what I was making there.  Of course he said if everything fails with my plans to work at Citigroup, he said I had a job waiting for me there.  Supposedly after I left, about six more people left.  Maybe a better retention program should be in order eh? hahaha.  So I'm going to lift some weights, no cardio though, since its raining outside.  Then I'm going to go rent some DVDs and let see what happens.

						   Nothing much happened today except for strenuous work.  Once again it was hot as hell too.  A roll of insulation is probably like 100 pounds I think, we had to unload 75 rolls off the truck then neatly stack them....  In total we should get around 224 rolls through out the work period...  After I was done moving the rolls, my boxers were soaked.  Too much work and too much heat, hahaha.  I swear by the time I'm done with this gig, I would not have to hit the gym for the rest of this year.  Now its freaking raining like Carribean on hurricane season.  There is a tornado watch going in effect here in DeKalb.  I swear, the weather in midwest is really fucked up.  Insulation glass fibers are doing wonder to my skin, my whole arms is a large red patch of irritation.  Plus the constant one to two inches cuts along the arms or legs.  I got a deep one inch cut on my leg today, all those sharp metals around the work site.  Funny thing is, I went to the first aid cabinet and there was no band aid big enough to cover the cut.  So I "clean" the cut with this tiny wipe, but the bleeding just is too much for the tiny little paper.  Even though it was a small paper wipe, the alcohol on that paper packed a big punch...  I was whinning like a girl.  Then I patched up the cut with some paper towel and some duct tape. hehe  My night shift will start tomorrow, so I have to stay awake till really late/early and then sleep, if I sleep now I will have a major issue tomorrow night, it's twelve hours and I'm really tired from today.. :(  Yesterday I chatted with Dana and Willem, oh boy, Willem turned out to be psychic, he cut right through my bullshit when I was innocently asking Dana how Wakako was doing...  Damn you Willem, not in front of Dana.  Hmm I'm leading a very uninteresting life right now, so this is it for today.  Well I guess I don't have to mention who I miss or what I'm concerned about...

						   Nothing much happened today, except work was really hard.  It's really hot here in DeKalb so when I'm lifted to the ceiling at,it must be like 50 degrees Celsius.  Plus the other two guys ain't doing a lick of work, they are on the ground just smoking cigarettes and talking.  This is going to be a loong two months of work.  This mean I'll be back around beginning or mid October, well as long as I get back before my birthday, I'm ok with it.  First party out hardcore on my birthday, then there is Halloween ten days after.  Such a nice combo...  Then I'm thinking in waiting on Eugene to get back to Riga from Moscow so I can plan my trip to Riga.  On a funny note, a couple of days ago, I ran out of those "hotel shampoo"  so I went to the front desk and asked the concierge for more.  Now keep in mind that she is and old lady with white hair.  So I tell her "mam' , could I have some more shampoo please?"  She replied with "Only if you wash my hair!"  Hmm, so, well I didn't really knew what to reply back, I got to admit I was a bit shocked, so I gave back a smile, which probably I shouldn't have done, but that is my standard reply when I don't know what to reply back.  I'm sure if Misha was here he would have known what to do.  Misha is our resident elderly ladies' gigolo.  Probably Misha would be "'ey mate, let's do her!"  Anyways, Dana seems to be back from the Caribbean, well yeah no one actually knew she went there.  Wish my life was that good.  Just go like that on a whim and be there and quickly get back before anyone notices she is missing.  But wait, there is more, she is going on a cruise with her brother to Alaska like in a week.  Yeah, while we work, she is "cruising" around.  Must an Iowa thing, because I know they are lazy, but a traveler?  After that, she is hitting DC for "WORK", hahah, I'm trying to get my brother to give an ok for her to stay over at our place, since we won't be back for a while and Dana won't be getting a salary till January.  When she suggested this, I acted stupid, as usual.  But that's me when I'm talking to pretty girls.  I told her, how would she get in my apartment if I had the keys, and she had to comeback with a standard dry sarcasm. "Well the US Government has this nice thing called MAIL."   Well I guess this is because in Brazil we are not very fond of sending valuables through mail...  And I guess this is a dumb comeback slash retort. hahah  Sodo seems to be reconstructing a vintage car, I must say whoever is reconstructing the car is McGuyver, the part is basically a tuna can (chassis), there is not much to it.  You know, McGuyver, that guys that makes space shuttle with just a tin can and a Swiss army pocket knife. hahah.  Ok still no news from Ellie. :(  Missing 1 and 3 :(

						   Steve came by yesterday, and late.  The good thing about Steve comning over here is he brought this cinnamon bread his mother bakes, it's really amazing.  Everytime Steve visits me, now he brings the bread, and he brought two.  haha.  Anyways, we brought along some beers and well after a hard day of work a bottle of beer went down really smooth.  Then came dinner, although I was not hungry, what else is there to do here?  So we asked the concierge what's around and she suggested this Mexican restaurant called Rosita.  The food was pretty average, but can't expect too much from a town this small.  After we were done eating, we asked for the check, Steve wanted cash so he could use his credit card and keep the cash.  When the waitress brings back the credit card, she asks who is Stephen Rose.  Well there are three people on the table, one caucasian and two asians.  Well, if the name on the credit card was Stephen Nakamura, or Stephen Kim, maybe it could be me or my brother.  So Steve asked her why she asked who was Stephen Rose.  She then tried to explain why.  Don't really remember what she said but the "invited" us to a party.  We were asking what there is to do in town, if there are clubs, etc... Default Sungi's line of question.  That's why she mentioned about the party.  Ok so she put her number on a paper and told us where to go.   Something John Street.  College student working as waitress, thus live close to Northern Illinois University campus.  Now Steve called her a couple of times but, she would not answer.  I just don't understand why she would invite and then back out.  Just strikes me odd.  Anyways, we tried to get to the place anyways and well there was nothing going on.  Plus, who the hell would want to go a "Smoothie Party"?  When we were at the restuarant she was like "We got some stuff from our boss."  The "STUFF" were smoothies...  weird people. After that, we basically drove around the town a bit, then to Northern Illinois campus, and came back to the hotel.  I mean I had to work, so I think it was about two or three in the morning.  Then I had to wake up at six in the morning to go to work...  It was good though, broke the boring routine.  Steve also brought me a couple of books, so now I will have some interesting stuff to read till the end of the gig.  Steve will be coming back in about three weeks when the classes here in Northern Illinois Univeristy classes start, I think.  HAHAHAH.  Anyways I miss you all, you know who, and enjoy the random pictures taken that day.

						   Lately I've been taking a lot of pills, I had even had to buy a pill case.  Everyday I take; two advils for my muscles and joints pain, four starch blocker pills for my lunch, three caffeine pills for night shift, two creatine capsules before lifting weights and two multivitamins.  I wonder if taking that much pills and capsules are healthy...  My daily meal is composed of one cup of apple juice and two small cinammon rolls for breakfast, two turkey ham sandwiches(2 slices of turkey ham, and 2 slices of whole grain bread per sandwich, nothing else) and one Snickers bar to last both lunch and dinner.  Not the healthiest meal plan out there, but it's not like I have much of a choice since there is nothing near the work area that would be open for me to take a decent meal during night shift.  As you see there are lot of starch food in my meals, thus why I'm taking starch blocker pills.  Yet my meals must provide a nutritious or delicious blood for the mosquitoes.  My sexy legs looks like a war zone. hahaha.  Moving on to different topics, it seems there were a slow down on blogging updates amongest people. Let's hope it doesn't go back to people not updating their blogs again.  I would hate to be the only one updating AGAIN.  Been trying to reach Dana regarding her stay over at my place, but well, none of my messages goes through, so I guess she will only know about this when she gets back from Texas, but then it could be too late.  At least posting here it will be proof that I tried.  I'm still waiting for Carlos to send me in this new cell phone number, I'm still laughing how he sends an email telling me about how he got a new cell phone yet he fails to send me the number on the same email.  Anyways, I have to get ready to go to work.  So everyone have a good day.   urlLink    It's like this all around my sexy legs.&nbsp; urlLink

						   Ellie update has a picture of her self portrait she took with her cell phone camera.  Even tough cell phone camera take shitty pictures, there is not way to make her face look bad.  Well I don't know what happened since she went to Japan, but her face is just soo, soo nice?  I thought stress from NTT DoCoMo, and age would affect somewhat, but god damn, she looks much younger than how she looked like in Georgetown.  So here goes my self portrait picture from my shitty cell phone camera, at work, dirty, unshaved, err.. etc...  Ok I'm tired, so I'm hitting the bed.    urlLink    I guess its my turn to upload a self portrait from the cell phone camera.&nbsp; urlLink

						   I know I missed yesterday's post, and no, I'm not dead, but if I ever stop blogging without any notice, then I'm probably at the hospital or dead. hehe.  Ok so what happened yesterday was that I was so tired that I passed out right after I got back to my room.  Nothing much happened anyways, just like today, and just like how it will be for the next two months...  At a very slow pace, due to all my time restrictions, I've been reading and enjoying  this book that Steve brought to me.  It's called "Nonzero"  by Robert Wright.  It deals a lot with human history and it's cultural evolution and human psyche.  The author tries to show how during this evolution, these things are intertwined and almost everything in this world is happening for a reason, not just complete chaos.  This is truly my type of book, I'm the kind of person that is really into history(the only cable channel I think its worth watching is History Channel and Comedy Central, haha), specially when dealing with ancient civilizations(Sumerians, Egyptology, etc...  No wonder I excelled in history classes since I was a kid.  Plus I'm a big fan on human psychology; during college I had a couple of psychology class, and because of some issues when I was younger, I had therapy sessions with a psychiatrist, which incensed a curiosity on human psychology.  I would really recommend this book to someone that would share interests as I do.   Ellie, finally updated her blog(after many attempts to have Ellie give some news, she finally listened to Dana's plea), and there is a bit of good news.  Her mother diagnostics, seems to reflect that it is not as bad as it was first thought to be, I'm not trying to demean the seriousness of the situation, but as Ellie says, it a good news indeed.  I hope this bring a bit of peace to your mind Ellie, and hopefully lower a notch on your heart rate.  Best of wishes to your mother on her way to the surgery, and best wishes to you as well Ellie.  Anyways, I'm leading a very uninteresting life, work is the same all the time, nothing much more to tell, except that well, I have to deal with my pessimistic, narcissist, etc.. brother the whole shift...  Misha is over at NYC doing some mad partying, and of course I missed...  I hate adult life, and work.  Let me be a bum and have my parents wire money again...  So much easier :(  Dana because of reasons mentioned above(about my brother), I decided to wait for a time when my brother is in a more compliant mood in order to ask him if he was ok with you moving in while we were at Dekalb.  Anyways, he said its ok, but I still need to iron out some stuff regarding your stay with him,  so I will give you a definite day when you can move in.
