       urlLink    Spiderman&nbsp; urlLink     I wanted to be like spiderman and be a hero, I consider this world to be easily distressed yet I cannot do something unless I am someone like spiderman,  no for I could not be spiderman but I could be a hero now; to here, to there, to  beyond, and where ever... and still nowhere When you learn that the world is hollow that is the time that sadness in you increases greatly,  Everything then disappears....

      To wait and wait and wait. To believe and believe and believe. Forget thee not for the reason that I live on is for the day when my baby, my child comes home to me. Yonder to the north where geese sing their song to their number, now is less than which thet came those who do not return. Travel to the house where the dead once lived safely, singing bird. Only the sound from within is the sign of sorrow. Then only I am left behind. To be alone once again. I wish I were a bird. But if I was I'd be a bird in a cage... a Cage of my tears frozen for eternity.

      Im excited with my new blog site, hehe... even if Im not really familiar on how to post my pics here and all... Anyways, this would be another learning experience (hopefully) for me. This brings me to some memories of my past....:)  Looking back to everything, I realize how things – bosses, teachers, classmates, friends, job, gimmicks, sports ---  to mention a few – helped me moved to where I am now. How each experience is a symbol of everything that it’s been all about. And how I can’t carry them all in my pockets yet I can cherish in my heart.  I went through many years of learning and hard work, treating everything in cool perspective. One of my most memorable work experiences was when I become a callcenter interaction associate. I was serving yet, having fun. Learning but teaching. Falling down and getting up. Dreams and reality. It's like my life now--making a statement without saying anything. Making things mean something. I miss those days. I miss my high school/college friends and yeah, the Batch 12-Comanches of TXU-Rangers!   We built castles. And it just keeps getting better.

      Wonderful Journey!  urlLink     TombScrew   That pic was taken last June 1, 2004 when I had a shor vacation in our resthouse somewhere in south. I was with my cuzins, the water is soo cooL... It was nice to frolick into the river, I went back into the brook innocence. Hehe..I was reminded of the "Wonderful Journey"  song which was the contest piece during our college intrams' interpretative dance contest back in 1999. Wuwzers! I remembered Fonyang, Baul, Mafs, did Meryll join?, and JR also... yeah, they danced..., ey! here's the lyrics of that song:    WONDERFUL JOURNEY     We were strangers, starting out on a journey. Never dreaming what we'd have to go through. Now here we are, I'm suddenly standing, at the beginning with you. No one told me, I was going to find you. Unexpected, what you did to my heart. When I lost hope, you were there to remind me this is the start.  And life is a road, and I wanna keep going. Love is a river and I wanna keep flowing. Life is a road, now and forever, wonderful journey. I'll be there when the world stops turning. I'll be there when the storm is through. In the end I want to be standing at the beginning with you.  We were strangers, on a crazy adventure. Never dreaming, how our dreams would come true. Now here we stand, unafraid of the future, at the beginning with you. Knew there was somebody, somewhere, I need love in the dark. Now I know my dream will live on, I've been waiting so long. Nothing's going to tear us apart!  Life is a road and I wanna keep going,  Love is a river and I wanna keep going on. Starting out on a journey!  Life is a road and I wanna keep going. Love is a river and I wanna keep flowing. In the end, I want to be standing, at the beginning, with you.
