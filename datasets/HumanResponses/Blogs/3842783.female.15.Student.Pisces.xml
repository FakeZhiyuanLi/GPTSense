       I love that, I have my own room, because I can put this  bear  here and that doll there, that's great you know. I feel my own room presents me. About my room, it is pink, It is small and nice, It is near my sister's room"najma" and that is a problem ;( except that it is comfortable. I have a very big bed, I can move from the right side to the left side. My first day, when I slept on my bed I fall on the ground more than once, Najma said : I heard  booom ..baaam ...Boom ...baam  :) I cleaned my room today, and I found my copybook when I was in the examination days last month. When I saw it, I felt my heart broken into two peaces ..ah .. ah ...........thanks god it ended. I love to pretty my own room with   bears   and the things that I love, because that give me back my memories and that give me good feeling.  you can also see when you look at my room' small desk, I have :   Stories ,  history books,and poetry books there are Islamic books too. I love read story, Islam and poem but the others, I don't .   the funny story to you , when I sleep, my eyes are nearly open and that scares. When my aunts came to Mosul from Baghdad, they didn't accept to sleep with me in the same room :( one day when I was sleepy my sister "Najma" told me  :  don't forget to close your eyes, ha ha ha ha ..That is not funny, is it ?? :) ........

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a girl, I am   15   years old ,I have 2 sisters,   Najma   is one of them , I have great father, he is a doctor and agreat mother, she is an engineer. we live in mosul&nbsp;a city in the north of Iraq .  My grandfather&nbsp; is&nbsp;a scientist and an enginreer&nbsp;proffessor, he and my grandmother and my cousins and my relatives&nbsp;&nbsp;lived in Baghdad, we travelled to&nbsp;see them&nbsp;every&nbsp; summer and we have a good time.  My&nbsp;big sister is married and I dont have a brother therefore I&nbsp;share most of&nbsp;&nbsp;my time with Najma(talk, fight, cook and&nbsp;laugh) she is realy funny, but we are different. I love what she hates, she loves what I hate. all my friends look to me&nbsp;as some one lucky to have a sister like her, and you certainly agree with them. In all my life I was&nbsp;the one in control,&nbsp;but suddenly !!!! oops, what happened ??????   :( &nbsp;  all the things went &nbsp;out of my control .  what happened ??? I dont know !!  I feel that I am special, I look to the life in&nbsp;a different&nbsp;view than you do, I love life, I love people, and I wish the best to my family and my friends.    The hero&nbsp;of&nbsp; my childhood   is my grand father. He is a wonderful man I cant&nbsp;describe him. I saw him last week and&nbsp; I missed him from now. I want to be like him .  Because I am the youngest in my family I look like (  cinderella   ), thanks god for&nbsp;every thing&nbsp;............

      الفكرة هي انه اجري مسابقة للرسم ببرنامج الرسم الذي ينزل تلقائيا على الحاسبة واساس المسابقة ان يقوم كل مشترك برسم صورة ثم بعثها على عنواني البريدي على الهوتمبل الموجود والمدون في البلوك ومن بعد استلامه ساقوم ببعثه انا على البلوك ومن بعد ذلك سيقوم كل شخص يحب التصويت بالتصويت على اكثر اثنين يتوقع لهما الفوز ومن سيجمع اكثر عدد من معجبي الصورة سيعلن بانه هو الفائز.وساشارك انا شخصيا بالمسابقة   my idea is to do a drawing contest in program (paint) , and evry one will draw a picture and send it to my e-mail and then I will send it to my blog,and after that you will decide who is the best ( you choose the best 2 ) , and the player who has the highest score will win the game.

       urlLink    I live in a rich country, Iraq is one of the richest country in the world, One of our treasures is dates,we had 20 million dates tree before the war,We appropriated second degree after al-arabia al-sudia in the number of dates tree. Dates grow in the south of iraq more than in the north,coz dates need the heat and light to grow and also it need water and humidity which we have it in the south of iraq.dates are very usefull to us, it is one of the fruit which had been mentioned in the holy Quraan, and Muhamad the messenger of god advise us to eat this created fruit. So,On september this fruit will ripen. and it will be available in the market.&nbsp; urlLink

      A jobless man applied for the position of "office boy" at Microsoft. The HR manager interviewed him then watched him cleaning the floor as a test. "You are employed" he said."Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill in, as well as date when you may start.  The man replied "But I don't have a computer, neither an email."I'm sorry", said the HR manager,"If you don't have an email, that means you do not exist. Andwho doesn't exist, cannot have the job.The man left with no hope at all. He didn't know what to do, with only $10 in his pocket. He then decided to go to the supermarket and buy a 10 Kg tomato crate. He then sold the tomatoes in a door to door round. In less than two hours, he succeeded to double his capital. He repeated the operation three times, and returned home with $60. The man realized that he can survive by this way, and started to go everyday earlier, and return late Thus, his money doubled or tripled every day. Shortly, he bought a cart, then a truck, then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles. 5 years later, the man is one of the biggest food retailers in the US.  He started to plan his family's future, and decided to have a life insurance. He called an insurance broker, and chose a protection plan. When the conversation was concluded, the broker asked him his email. The man replied, "I don't have an email". The broker answered curiously, "You don't have an email, and yet have succeeded to build an empire. Can you imagine what you could have been if you had an email?!!" The man thought for a while and replied, "Yes, I'd be an office boy at Microsoft!"   Moral of the story :  1)  Internet is not the solution to your life.  2)  If you don't have internet, and work hard, you can be a millionaire.  3)  If you received this message by email, you are closer to being an office boy, than a millionaire... Have a great day !!!  P.S -Do not forward this email    back   to me, i m closing all my email addresses & going to sell tomatoes!!!      urlLink

      today, we went out of our house, ( me,Najma,my big sister,and my mother). any way, we went to make shopping, and we bought a baby's stroller. after that we went to the shop. and we bought ( ice cream, candies,....) . any way,after we finished the shopping,We took my big sister to her house and came back to our home. We should open the door but where is the key?? .. "hnk do you have the key?" my mother said "no mam I dont" I said "Najma do you have the key?"Mother said "sorry mam I don't" Najma said  oh ...  oo o o o oo oh  where is they key ??????? We decided to go back to my sister to see if she has it, coz  she was the one who locked the door.so , We went to her house and we were sure that she has the key . But ,She doesn't , She told us that she doesn't remmember if she locked it, and she doesn't know where she put the key . We went to our home again and looked there and here , Maybe we'll find it, but no we didnt . So , we were so angry . Najma and my mother began to wash the garage and then the car and water the plants. When I looked at them, One thing came to my mind. where is the camera??? I looked by the window to our house ,And saw the television  and our computer and said where are you ???????? We have to wait for my father to come to our house and open the door, We called him and waited for him to come. ooh we have ice cream !! , and we have finger chips . We ate them ,after that the time passed slowly, slowllllllllllly .,I looked  inside the car and searched, maybe I'll find the keys . after one and a half  hours, my father came to the house and opened the door . haaaaeeeeeeee finally we are in our home. but until now, we didn't find the key.  ya rabi rah nakull razalah walah lah ???
