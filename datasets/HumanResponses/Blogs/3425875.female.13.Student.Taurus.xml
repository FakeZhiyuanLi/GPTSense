      Well, after getting suddenly disconnected, we figured that there was going to be a new patch.  And VOILA!  There was a new patch!  A couple of features here and there were added.  But along with the happiness comes the anger...  After the patch, the server's become unstable and disconnects players randomly.  Sasa (Kuraki) can't move without being disconnected.  There's some weirdo chinese system messages popping up.  My font has miraculously changed to bold and has become somewhat illegible.  It's so horrible...  =_=

      Hi there, I'm ebiru. But if you ask Valachan/(valanexia) I'm ebbiez =P  So.. mmm lets see, I found out about M&M 2.5 on a mIRC channel from acouple friends a long long time ago. @_@ Played off and on till it went pay to play and that was the end of that. So I got 3.0 when it was released and here I am playing off and on although with all client crashes and disconnections most of the time I'm on the login screen.  I myself have grown a little bored with Monster & Me as there isn't much to it and everywhere I go I seem to crash. ¬_¬  So lately I've been sitting in RemoteCave other wise known as the "TG/Training Grounds" for lazy people. ^-^
