      THE RACE BEGINS - THE 76TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS   At the KODAK THEATER, Hollywood and Highland - California   Sunday February 29th, 2004     PREDICTIONS IN THE MAJOR CATEGORIES by Rex A Okpodu     Updated February 23rd, 2004 ----------------------------------   BEST PICTURE  THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING (New Line Cinema)   Golden Globe Winner, Best Picture—Drama  Best Ensemble winner, Screen Actors Guild 2003  This, of course, is the conclusion to the epic Tolkien fantasy trilogy about the quest for the ring.   This is the favorite to win.  Reasons for: It is overdue for a win, since it has two previous consecutive Best Picture nominations for the prequels—The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.   The trilogy has amassed 30 nominations (11 this time around) and 6 wins since 2001.   The winner of the Directors Guild of America(DGA) award usually wins best picture(see: director category below)  Reasons against: With so much riding on this conclusion to the already commercially successful trilogy, has it actually been worth the wait? The consensus seems to be resoundingly positive. But will the academy honor a fantasy film? It never has before, despite nominations for Star Wars (1977) and E.T.(1982). What’s more, Academy voters might resent their hands being forced by a sense of obligation.   MYSTIC RIVER (Warner Bros.)    This is the closest competitor to The Return of the King. It is a drama about childhood friends reunited by the murder of one of their children.   Reasons for: It is turning out to be this year's critical champion, with a slew of citations from reviewers. Older members of the academy have been being buzzing about it being a gritty drama in the same league with films like A Streetcar Named Desire. It is Clint Eastwood's best work since Unforgiven and it has a terrific cast in Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, and Marcia Gay Harden.  Reasons against: Like In the Bedroom (2001), it might be too dark for the more mainstream academy voters. Also, Warner Bros. is not very good at Oscar campaigns.    SEABISCUIT (Universal/DreamWorks)   Reasons for: It is a summer box-office champ that has sold extremely well since its recent release on DVD.  Reasons against: Its Best Picture nomination might be viewed as sufficient reward.   MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (Universal/Fox/Miramax)   This stirring action-adventure picture is about the strangeness of life on the far side of the world, set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars.  Reasons for: This film has the backing of three Studios (Fox, Miramax, and Universal) which means a lot of industry votes and support. Despite his offscreen reputation, the academy loves Crowe, who has a history of powering a good film to multiple nominations—The Insider, Gladiator, and  A Beautiful Mind in recent years. Also, epic, male-driven films do well at the Academy.   Reasons against: If people want an epic, they’ll probably vote for The Return of the King. Finally, seagoing films do not often do well with the academy (Titanic was an exception.)    LOST IN TRANSLATION (Focus Features)  Reasons for: It might benefit if the academy decides to reward a comedy as Best Picture. It has a boost boost from critics around the nation. It would probably fare better here if it had been directed by a man.    BEST DIRECTOR   PETER JACKSON, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   Golden Globe Winner, Best Director  Directors Guild of America, Winner at his third consecutive nomination.  After one failed Best Director nomination in 2001 and a snub in 2002, Jackson is a major contender for a win with this final installment of the hobbit story.   Reasons for:Won best director at the Directors Guild of America dinner 2004. The DGA winner has matched the Oscar winner for best director and picture ninety percent of the time since it's inception in 1948  The exceptions were in: 1948 Joseph L. Mankiewicz(A Letter to Three Wives) - DGA         John Huston(Treasure of Sierra Madre) - Oscar(director)         Hamlet - best picture 1968 Anthony Harvey(Lion in Winter) - DGA         Carol Reed(Oliver) - Oscars(director and picture) 1995 Ron Howard(Apollo 13) - DGA         Mel Gibson(Braveheart) - Oscars (director and picture) 2000 Ang Lee(Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) - DGA         Steven Soderbergh(Traffic) - Oscar (director)         Gladiator - best picture) 2002 Rob Marshall(Chicago) - DGA         Roman Polanski(The Pianist) - Oscar          Chicago - picture  There is widespread agreement that he has completed a mammoth task and made a classic. In addition, the trilogy has been a tremendous money-spinner for the industry.   Reasons against: His newfound commercial success (he is getting $20 million for his next project, King Kong) might be viewed as adequate reward. And he is still a Hollywood outsider.  PETER WEIR, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World    Reasons for: He is a consistently good director and four-time previous nominee in this category forWitness (1985), Dead Poets Society (1989), Green Card (1990), and The Truman Show (1998). He is long overdue for a win, and this could be his year.  Recently won the BAFTA and like last year's win by Roman Polanski,could be the start of a momentum  Reason against: Academy voters always resent that sense of obligation to an overdue director.  This year belongs to Peter Jackson and ROTK   CLINT EASTWOOD, Mystic River    Reasons for: There is widespread agreement that this is Eastwood’s best work since Unforgiven (1992). He is a Hollywood player with tremendous clout and star power.   Reasons against: He has already been rewarded amply by the academy. A few people are turned off by the film's dark material. The academy might want to reward newer talent or someone overdue for the award.(see Peter Jackson - above)  SOFIA COPPOLA, Lost in Translation    Reasons for: The film garnered very good reviews and could be rewarded in this category, though Coppola’s much more likely to be honored with a screenplay statuette. She is a member of a well-connected filmmaking family—her father is Francis Ford Coppola. This is only the third nomination for a woman in this category in 76 years—Lina Wertmuller (Seven Beauties, 1976) and Jane Campion (The Piano, 1994) are the others.  Reasons against: The academy has a gender bias in this category. And despite widespread rave reviews.   FERNANDO MEIRELLES, City of God  Reason for: This film, bringing the first nomination for this Brazilian director, has been acclaimed worldwide.  Reason against: The movie does not have the added bonus of being nominated in the foreign-language category, as is usual with similar recent examples in this category, such as Life Is Beautiful (1998) or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, (2000), both of which won in the foreign-language  category.  BEST ACTOR  SEAN PENN, Mystic River   Golden Globe Winner, Best Actor—Drama   Reasons for: This is turning out to be the Year of Penn. With two critically acclaimed films in his favor (21 Grams is the other, an AA win is a very strong possibility. And with three previous nominations in this category—Dead Man Walking (1995), Sweet and Lowdown (1999), and I Am Sam (2001), he is overdue for a win.   Reasons against: His outspoken antiwar campaign could bring him some unwelcome backlash. His volatile nature could be his undoing during Oscar campaign time. He is unlikely to want to be seen as eager for academy recognition, which could alienate some. His surprise loss  at the SAGs might indicate a loss of momentum Him not showing up at the Golden Globes did not help.  BEN KINGSLEY, House of Sand and Fog    Reasons for: Has got major buzz about his performance in this film. He may be due for another Oscar after two previous nominations in the supporting category for Bugsy (1991) and Sexy Beast (2001), with a win for the lead role in Gandhi (1982).   Reasons against: Without a major push, this movie may be squeezed out. What’s more, it doesn’t have big box office.   BILL MURRAY, Lost in Translation  Golden Globe Winner, Best Actor—Musical or Comedy   Reasons for: He has won many critics’ awards. He was overlooked for Rushmore (1999). His performance at the podium for his Golden Globe win was impressive and delightful.  Reasons against: Despite the raves, the academy does not go for this kind of deadpan comic performance(at least the older members do not).  Like Penn(above),was considered a shoo-in at the SAGs and his loss here might indicate a last minute loss of momentum.  JOHNNY DEPP, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl   SAG Winner, Best Actor  Reasons for: He got raves and the movie was a huge hit in both the theaters and on DVD. His surprise victory at the SAGs indicates widespread support by the Acting branch who also make up the largest group at AMPAS.  Reasons against:Despite the SAG award,the year probably belongs to Penn or Murray  JUDE LAW, Cold Mountain  Reasons for: He is a former Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actor in The Talented Mr. Ripley. He managed to make the big five despite the poor overall showing by Cold Mountain.  Reason against: He was a big-name SAG omission.  BEST ACTRESS  CHARLIZE THERON, Monster   Golden Globe Winner, Best Actress—Drama  SAG Winner, Best Actress  Reasons for: The unstoppable frontrunner in this category - as indicated by wins at the Golden Globes and SAGs. She has the kind of role the academy likes in this biopic about a prostitute who was an executed murderess. Finally, as the past two winners in this category have shown, the academy absolutely adores women who play deglammed parts and who look great on the red carpet.   DIANE KEATON, Something's Gotta Give   Golden Globe Winner, Best Actress—Musical or Comedy   Reasons for: She is a beloved Hollywood veteran who is a previous Oscar winner for Annie Hall (1977). This comedy about older characters should should play very well with older members of the academy. She is the sole American nominee in a lineup of foreigners and every time that happened in the past 75 years,the American won (exception - 1998, Judi Dench won best supporting actress in an all foreigner lineup in which Kathy Bates(Primary Colors) was the only American)   Reason against: Like Sissy Spicek in 2001,the earlier momentum has vanished post - Golden Globes Keaton’s previous win is one of only five instances—the others being Glenda Jackson forA Touch of Class (1973), Cher for Moonstruck (1987), Helen Hunt for As Good as it Gets (1997), and Gwyneth Paltrow for Shakespeare in Love (1998)—of an actress winning in this category for a romantic comedy over the past four decades.   NAOMI WATTS, 21 Grams    Reasons for: She plays a flashy, Oscar-bait role in this gritty drama. She has rebounded from the setback of her noninclusion by the Golden Globes by taking the Los Angeles Film Critics’ Best Actress and scoring a nomination at the SAGs.  Reasons against: The dark nature of the film and the current restriction on screeners.  KEISHA CASTLE-HUGHES, Whale Rider   Reason for: Her inclusion at the SAGs indicates strong support for her title-role performance.  Reason against: At 13, she is currently the youngest ever nominee in this category since Isabel Adjani was a nominee at 20 for The Story of Adele H(1975)  Very young nominees tend to win in supporting category. Recent examples are Tatum O'neal(10) Paper Moon(1973) and Anna Paquin(11) The Piano(1993)   SAMANTHA MORTON, In America  Reason for: The strong showing of In America in three major categories suggests widespread support for this former Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress for 1999’s Sweet and Lowdown.  Reason against: Not enough people have seen the film.   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR  TIM ROBBINS, Mystic River  Golden Globe Winner, Best Supporting Actor  SAG Winner, Best Supporting Actor  Reasons for: The film's multiple nominations in major categories are a help. Plus the academy likes versatility—he has a previous directing nomination and even directed a win for his partner, Susan Sarandon, for Dead Man Walking (1995).   Reason against: His political views, although he gave a straightforward acceptance speech at the Golden Globes.   KEN WATANABE, The Last Samurai    Reason for: His strong, sexy performance.  Reason against: Aside from three technical award nominations, he is the sole beneficiary in a poor showing by this film.  ALEC BALDWIN, The Cooler   Reasons for: With his critics’ organization wins, he could be the dark horse in this category.  Reasons against: Not enough people have seen the film. His bullying history with ex-wife Kim Basinger doesn’t help.  BENICIO DEL TORO, 21 Grams   Reason for: As with costar Watts, the SAGs have revived his campaign, as it indicates good support for this film by the actors’ branch, which has many votes in the academy.  Reason against: He’s recently won an Oscar, for Traffic (2000).  DJIMON HOUNSOU, In America   Reason for: He plays an Oscar-bait role (a man with AIDS) in a film that has done very well at professional guild screenings..  Reason against:  He has a very low media profile for an Oscar nominee and not being a Golden Globe or SAG nominee did not help.  BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS  RENEE ZELLWEGER, Cold Mountain  Golden Globe Winner, Best Supporting Actress  SAG Winner, Best Supporting Actress  Reason for: Another Oscar chance (this will be her third in a row—in supporting category this time) for this nominee to get her overdue Oscar. The first SAG consecutive winner, 2003 - best actress (for Chicago) and 2004 - best supporting actress(for Cold Mountain)  Reason against: The usual anticipated backlash against Miramax, plus the movie did not do well in Oscar noms.  HOLLY HUNTER, Thirteen   Reason for: A good offering from a seasoned actress, who is an Oscar winner (The Piano) and three-time nominee. She is a favorite on the indie circuit.  Reason against: Will older/nonindie members of the academy bother to go see this movie?   PATRICIA CLARKSON, Pieces of April   Reasons for: East Coast indie-circuit queen has had a good year with this movie and The Station Agent.She may benefit from appearing on several critics’ lists nationwide. A double nomination at the SAGs shows momentum.  Reason against: Will enough people have actually seen this film?  MARCIA GAY HARDEN, Mystic River   Reasons for: Fresh from her Oscar success in Pollock (2001), she delivers a tour de force performance in the biggest female role in Eastwood's critically acclaimed drama. She would definitely benefit if there is a sweep by the film.   Reasons against: Her female role might get overlooked in this male-driven drama. Plus the academy might feel she has too recently been in the winners circle.  SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO, House of Sand and Fog  Reason for: She gave a wrenching performance in this small Oscar-bait role—she played a long-suffering, dislocated wife who endures family tragedy.   Reason against: Lack of a SAG nomination indicates weak support among the important actors’ bloc of Oscar voters.    FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM --------------------------------  THE BABARIAN INVASIONS (CANADA) Directed by Denys Arcand  EVIL (SWEDEN) Directed by Mikael Hafstrom  TWIN SISTERS (THE NETHERLANDS) Directed by Ben Sombogaart  THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI (JAPAN) Directed by Yoji Yamada  ZELARY (CZECH REPUBLIC) Directed by Ondrej Trojan     BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY  -----------------------------------  LOST IN TRANSLATION by Sofia Coppola   IN AMERICA by Jim, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan     BARBARIAN INVASIONS by Denys Arcand  FINDING NEMO by Andrew Stanton   DIRTY PRETTY THINGS  by Steven Knight       BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY -----------------------------------  MYSTIC RIVER - Adapted by Brian Helgeland, based on a novel by Dennis Lehane II   THE LORD OF THE RINGS - RETURN OF THE KING - Adapted by Peter Jackson,Fran Walsh,Phillipa Boyens and Stephan Sinclair based on  a novel by JRR Tolkien    SEABISCUIT - Adapted by Gary Ross,based on a novel by Linda Hillenbrand   AMERICAN SPLENDOR by Harvey Parker,Joyce Brabner,Shari Springer Berman  and Robert Pulcini   CITY OF GOD by Braulio Mantovani      ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS  ---------------------------------  FINDING NEMO (Disney,Pixar Animation Studios)  Directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich   BROTHER BEAR (Walt Disney Pictures)  Directed by Aaron Blaise and Robert Walker based on a  screenplay by Steve Bencich and Ron J.

      TUESDAY 27 JANUARY, 2004 - Oscar Nomination Morning -------------------------------------------------------------------- By Rex A. Okpodu Contributing Editor - Out.com  London,United kingdom  Watched the Golden Globes on "UK Living" last night at Sandra's(Sange) Was going to stay over but decided to rush back home and prepare for this morning since the Globes finished before midnight. I caught the last but one train from Turnpike lane to Baron's Court...In bed by 1am  Up by 9am this morning.   Got this email from BL(editor,out.com) saying we have to lead the story with something out-related...Charlize Theron(she is due the Oscar nomination for playing a gay(albeit none-sympathetic role) I guess he is right,afterall out.com is no Entertainment Weekly  Went online to set and wait for the live broadcast from abc.com. The announcement comes up at 05.30(PST) i.e 1.30pm(GMT)  Dominic rings to ask me how excited I am?..I am not amused! He seems to be more excited than I am...he thinks I am bottling it all up.... I guess he knows me too well  Michael rings..I ignore his call... I think people are starting to irritate me by all these phonecalls...don't they realise I will like to enjoy the moments before alone?  1.00pm - Nothing seems to be coming up by way of a url for ABC.com Decided to switch to BBC - It looks like the announcement will be live on News 24  Lots going on as the Preamble to the  Hutton Enquiry on the David Kelly suicide is also  being expected  Anna Ford mentions the imminent Oscar nomination on BBC News ... I have my live link up ready...the tv and computer are set to go......  1.28pm - News 24 starts a broadcast - with a link up ready on one of their screens  1.30pm - We are live to Los Angeles as Sigourney Weaver and Frank Pierson start the announcements  I am scribbling frantically even though I know the entire lists will be online in a few minutes.  I am also on the phone to Sange and giving her a live relay   Lots of surprises/shocks/etc 1.45pm - the announcement is over and I go back online for the full list I am amazed at such diversity...City of God for Best Director/Screenplay? Keisha-White for best actress? how come?We all thought the Focus Pictures was campaigning for her in the supporting category...obviously,the Academy thought otherwise since she did play the title/lead role  Later in the Afternoon... I share the news with Michael and then Dominic...a part of me feels anti-climatic now the announcement is over  I start on my blog edits as I have to get the write up to Brendan Lemon(out.com) for publication later today/tomorrow  Evening - started reading all the post nomination debate on the web. The general consensus is that it is the best set of nominations for a long time. While some of the races are  more or less sewn up (Rotk for best picture and director) others have opened...supporting actress,the screenplays,etc   WEDNESDAY 28 JANUARY,2004 ----------------------------------------  My article(with a bit of editing) is now live on out.com albeit in the editor's column...I would have preferred it on my own page but technical difficulties exist preclude from giving that.

Miramax still has the most nominations..still got the multiple nominations for City of God....talk about knocking one down when you have slipped down a bit! Too much is being read into it all...am sure Miramax will be back next year...am also sure the release date affected things a bit more than is being considered?  Sean Penn is now going to the Ceremony on Feb 29th....good for him. It was a bad decision not to sure up for the Golden Globes...giving some lame excuse.

Each time I read my VF..am still annoyed at the lack of updated texts Recording Angels in America(the award winning HBO film) for Sange who is away skiing in Switzerland  Before bedtime...having a glimpse at what we are to expect for Oscar 77(2005) Watching The Hours(2002) - winner of 1 Oscar - Best Actress at the 75th Academy Awards  SUNDAY 8 FEBRUARY, 2004 ------------------------------ Post DGA - as expected peter Jackson(ROTK) won... Penn did attend...as well as sevaral others Sent in updates to BL at out.com Watched Smallville with DK at brunch Had drinks with a friend ...who happens to be the designer Julian Macdonald..he tells me confidentially,  Liv Tyler will be wearing one of his(Givenchy) dresses and doing a major presentation at the Oscars(29th Feb) - I guess - introducing the clip for ROTK? Recording the last part of Angels in America More - The Hours..before bed tonight  MONDAY 9th -------------------------------- Started viewing the weekend recording of Angels in America BL accepted updates but we will only be having one for out.com post-SAG on the 22nd(one week before d-day)  TUESDAY 10th ------------------ Yet to finish AIA....really enjoyable.  Oscar.org released the pics from Monday's luncheon...Sean Penn attended with his mother(good for him and his campaign)  BL tells me he(Sean Penn) has been sounding off about Iraq again..story was not widely reported, so he is might still be safe from a backlash!   10.30pm Just got back from a screening of a Brazillian film  at the BCA in London with Dom and Carlos -  Deus e Brasileiro(God is Brazillian)..Nice to look at,had it's moments but did not quite take off  Finished the last part of AIA finally..thn watched live from the red carpet at the Golden Globes with Joan Rivers(the mop) and her daughter,Melissa...Nicole Kidman looked and sounded awful..she is beginning to take herself too seriously(in my opinion)  WEDNESDAY 11TH -----------------------  11pm  Saw "Something's Gotta Give"(Best Actress Nominee - 76th Academy Awards) with  Sange...was witty,well styled and enjoyable but why do hollywood movies have to tie up everything with a bow right to the very end..leaving nothing to the imagination? Is it for the aaah! factor?..fairy tale endings and all that...it would have been a much better and more realistic movie had it ended with Jack walking down alone on the Seine and regretting what might have been...sort of like real life...... And did we really have to see them all living happily ever after with their grandchild and all that?  More  - The Hours...tonight  THURSDAY 12TH --------------------- Catching up with reading matter from the web about Oscar 76 Sent out various emails updating fellow enthusiasts with word  on - the above A rant-email sent about the current VF issue which Nathaniel(the film experience) says is "adoring" Did he get the same issue as me?

On further analysis BAFTA is not as obliged as AMPAS to give Best pic to ROTK afterall they already gave best pic to the first part of the trilogy for 2001.... we'll see how it falls out for Sunday Managed another 10 minutes of The Hours...when will it end?

Saw "Girl with the Pearl Earring"( 4 nominations including best costume - Oscar's 76th) was very impressed with the way the storywas told...the art direction,acting,etc was very restrained - one could tell it was not a European production  Watched a bit more of Oscar's 75th - always moving to Chris Cooper (best supp. actor) and Catherine Z.

      OSCAR SPECULATION SITE...... THE ROAD TO OSCAR...THE 77TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS    August 7, 2004    Rex A. Okpodu Contributing Editor,  Out.com     Best Picture - Five possibilities from the following:  The Aviator (Warner Bros./Miramax) Alexander (Warner Bros.) J.M. Barrie's Neverland (Miramax) The Phantom of the Opera (Warner Bros.) Collateral (Dreamworks) Closer (Columbia) A Very Long Engagement (WB) The Passion of the Christ (Newmarket) Spanglish (Columbia) "Fahrenheit 9/11" (Miramax/Lion's Gate)    Martin Scorsese's The Aviator emerges as the early favorite for at least a nomination and or win despite the fact that the Academy has snubbed him four times previously (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Gangs of New York ).   Oliver Stone's Alexander - Another 2004 Warner Brothers production with Oscar predigree and could be WB's  option since Troy failed to live up to expectations  J.M. Barrie's Neverland will be a critical darling, following in the footsteps of director Marc Foster's last film, Monster's Ball.   The musical/comedy spot is between Disney's The Last Shot, with rookie director Jeff Nathanson at the helm and Joel Shumacher's The Phantom of the Opera.  Taking over a 100 million at the box office(a record for a documentary) and general critical support, F 9/11 might be pushed in this as well as the documentary category especially if it starts appearing on several Critics Best Picture lists in the Fall   Best Director - Five possibilities from the following:  Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) Marc Foster (J.M. Barrie's Neverland) Mel Gibson (The Passion of the Christ) Jeff Nathanson (The Last Shot) Michael Mann (Collateral) Mike Nichols (Closer) Oliver Stone  (Alexander) Mira Nair (Vanity Fair) John Madden (Proof)   The Academy usually awards best director nominations to the Best Picture nominees, with the argument that if a movie is good enough to be nominated for Best Picture it has to be well directed. However, there is always one film that gets nominated that isn't a Best Picture nominee, and one suspects that it might be Mel Gibson for The Passion of the Christ.   Best Actor - Five possibilities from the following:  Jeff Bridges (Door in the Floor) Jim Carrey (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) Leonardo DiCaprio (The Aviator) Colin Farrell (Alexander) Denzel Washington (The Manchurian Candidate) Johnny Depp (J.M. Barrie's Neverland) James Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ) Tom Cruise (Collateral) Liam Neeson (Kinsey) Bill Murray (The Life Aquatic) Jamie Foxx (Ray)  With rave reviews for this role and being long overdue for a win, Jeff Bridges is the current frontrunner  Leonardo DiCaprio might get his first best actor nomination, after getting snubbed for Titanic and Gangs of New York.   Collin Farrell (Hollywood's up and coming enfant terrible) has been on the radar since Tigerland(2000) and this film with it's bisexual overtones from Oliver Stone could get the gay friendly vote and lead to a nomination  Johnny Depp showed his popularity after his light role with Pirates of the Carribean led to a nomination last year, and his dramatic turn in this film could see him back again in Neverland   Tom Cruise was snubbed last year and could return this year especially as this is a Michael Mann film where TC is acting against type (same as his last nomination for Magnolia in 1999)  Kevin Kline's portrayal of Cole Porter's marriage is sort of gay without being too gay and is the kind of film palatable to the Academy's taste especially it gets several critics nods    Best Actress - Five possibilities from the following:  Anne Reid (Mother)  Robin Wright Penn (A Home At The End of the World) Kate Wnslet (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) Gwyneth Paltrow (Proof) Emily Rosum (The Phantom of the Opera) Nicole Kidman (Birth) Reese Witherspoon  (Walk the Line) Cate Blanchett (The Life Acquatic) Joan Allen (The Upside of Anger) Annette Benning (Being Julia) Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace) Andrey Tatou (A Very Long Engagement)    Anne Reid is an early frontrunner with the critics and might get the Academy's nod at nomination time  Robin Wright Penn makes the vote for a gay - friendly film also starring Colin Farrell. The Academy likes married couples in its circle especially since Sean won this year and might be presenting the award next year  Nicole Kidman's problem Oscarwise is that she has many film roles but not all of them any good.She is a recent winner, was snubbed this year but might get a nomination next year if the film gets outstanding critical or box office recognition  Joan Allen is an overdue actress and could get in if the film or her acting role is well received  Annette Benning is another actress overdue for an Oscar and could be in the running  again this year  Reese Witherspoon, for the Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line, and Emily Rosum for The Phantom of the Opera, might get in a round up an uncharacteristically weak Best Actress category.   Best Supporting Actor - Five possibilities from the following:  Peter O'Toole (Troy) Jude Law (The Aviator) Alec Baldwin (The Last Shot) Patrick Wilson (The Phantom of the Opera) Anthony Hopkins (Alexander) Gary Oldman (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) Dustin Hoffman (J. M. Barrie's Neverland) Morgan Freeman (An Unfinished Life) Jim Broadbent (Vanity Fair) Jamie Foxx (Collateral) David Carradine (Kill Bill II)  Jude Law is the early favorite for The Aviator.  Peter O'Toole and Anthony Hopkins stake claim for the older generation of actors.   Newcomer, Patrick Wilson has an important role in The Phantom of the Opera.  Alec Baldwin's nomination for The Cooler could help him get nominated for The Last Shot but do not discount Gary Oldman for  the blockburster sequel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   Best Supporting Actress - Five possibilities from the following:  Irma P. Hall  (The Ladykillers) Kate Winslet  (J.M. Barrie's Neverland) Angelina Jolie  (Alexander) Toni Collete  (The Last Shot) Monica Belluci (The Passion of the Christ) Cate Blanchett  (The Aviator) Glenn Close (The Stepford Wives) Sissy Spicek (A Home At The End of the World) Natalie Portman (Closer or Garden State) Meryl Streep (The Manchurian Candidate)  Irma P. Hall won this year's Jury prize (Acting) at the Cannes Film Festival for The LadyKillers (directed by the Coen Brothers) and might make the Academy shortlist next year   The Academy loved Katherine Hepburn and they might love Blanchett's portrayal equally well.   Kate Winslet hasn't gotten much love since Titanic, but critics should love her in Neverland.   Monica Belluci had a powerful role as Mary Magdelene in The Passion of the Christ.   Toni Collete has been nominated for The Sixth Sense and could get another for The Last Shot.  After a string of unremarkable roles since 1999's win for Girl, Interrupted, Angelina Jolie, could be back with another nomination for her role in Alexander   Best Original Screenplay  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Aviator  J.M. Barrie's Neverland  The Last Shot The Village The Life Acquatic The Terminal   Unlike last year, which was dominated by Adapted Screenplays, 2004 should be dominated by the Original Screenplay category. Best Picture frontrunner, The Aviator is the favorite here as well.   Best Adapted Screenplay  Spanglish The Passion of the Christ The Phantom of the Opera An Unfinished Life Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Polar Express The Notebook  In an unusually weak Adapted Screeplay category, Troy, The Passion of the Christ, and The Phantom of the Opera all are early favorites. The writing of Prizoner of Azkaban is much better than the first two films, so expect it to be a player.   Best Animated Film  Shrek 2  The Polar Express The Incredibles Shark Tale Home on the Range   The inclusion of the Best Animated Film category has increased the number of animated films being made.  The first Shrek movie won the first Animated feature film Oscar given for 2001 Shrek 2 has the reviews and box office success to be the first sequel to win not only a nomination, but a possible win in this category   Best Documentary feature category   "Fahrenheit 9/11" (directed by Michael Moore) Winner of the coveted Palme d'Or at the Festival making it the first documentary to win this prestigious award since Jacques Cousteau's "The Silent World" in 1956 Released to critical and box office acclaim in this election year, F9/11 is the first documentary to gross over 100 million Stateside and might even be a contender in the Best Picture category.  The Hunting of the President (directed by Nickolas Parry and Harry Thomason) - Documentary portrayal of the ten year alleged right wing conspiracy against the Clinton Presidency.  The Corporation (directed by Jennifer Abbott and  Mark Achbar) - A Documentary showing the rise and domination of the Corporation in today's capitalist America    OTHER FILMS TO WATCH OUT FOR (Assuming they meet the AMPAS deadline criteria)  From Cannes 04   The Life and death of Peter Sellers (directed by Stephen Hopkins) - Best Actor   The Motorcycle Diaries (directed Walter Salles) - Any nomination especially Director, Actor and Screenplay  Bad Education (directed by Pedro Almodovar) - Original Screenplay, Director or any of the Acting categories  Clean (directed by Olivier Assayas) - Best Actress winner at the Festival

      OSCAR'S CLASSICS  Commenced, March 30  Having had a break from the Oscars and other film related events by taking a two-weel break in Africa, I am back in the UK and decided to keep this diary of DVDs viewed  right through the year   My Oscar's classics series would consist of Oscar nominated/winning movies I have acquired and recently viewed on DVD   Selection is completely random    HIGH NOON (1952)   Recent viewing  of DVD  March 30 - 31  Directed by Fred Zinnemann  Nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture  Won 4 : Best Actor - Gary Cooper             Best Film Editing             Best Original Song and             Best Score- Comedy/Dramatic  DVD Special features:  The DVD special features were very disappointing - one expected a lot more indepth examination of the issues raised by the film - there was even a factual detail were i.e Gary Cooper won his second Oscar for this film (not the first one as summarised by reviewer, Leonard Matlin   TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD(1962)   DVD viewed April 1 - 4   Directed by Robert Mulligan  Nominated for 8 Academy Awards including best director and picture  Won 3,  Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Art/Set Direction (Black and White)  Brief Notes on DVD/Special features  The Special features were informative and very detailed - It is easily one of the best to accompany any film issued on a dvd.   GOSFORD PARK (2001) DVD viewed April 6 - 8  Directed by Robert Altman  Nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture Others were for Best Director,  Best Supporting Actress (two nominations), Art and Set Decoration and Best Costume Design  Won 1 - Best Original Screenplay - Julian Fellowes  DVD Special features   CITIZEN KANE (1941)  April 19 - May 6  Directed by Orson Welles  Nominated for 9 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director and Original Screenplay Other were for Best Actor, Art and Set Decoration, Cinematography (black and white), Film Editing, Best Dramatic Score and Best Sound Recording  Won only Best Original Screenplay but over the years has attained classic status as the Best American Film of all time  DVD extras - The Battle Over Citizen kane (1995 Acadamy Award best documentary nominee - A complete historical account of the making and attempted killing of the film - Orson Welles  vs  Press baron, William R Hearst  Contains complete interviews and newsreels by the major players involved in the project 60 years ago  Two film commentaries -  by Director, Peter Bogdanovich and Critic, Roger Ebert both illuminating the ground breaking film making style of first time director,  Orson Welles. For instance - the use of scratched newsreel indicating age/realistic look.  The innovative use of experimental cinematography,long shots,lights,handheld camera work, special use of light for the clear focus of fore and back ground shots during the entire film  Citizen Kane was one of the first film's to use innovative special effects which was very ground breaking and very far advanced for it's time   Most of the actors were from Welle's New York Mercury theater and were first time film actors    THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962) DVD viewed May 7 - 10  Directed by John Frankenheimer  Nominated for 2 Academy Awards - Best Supporting Actress and Best Film Editing  Won - None  Brief Notes on DVD/Special Features  Decided to watch this one more time before the 2004 release of the remake starring Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington as directed by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner for best director from the multi Oscar winning film, The Silence of the Lambs -1991)  Original,chilling and full of suspense. It resonates very much with the prevailing political climate brought about by the current "war on terror"  Extras features a short documentary/interview made in 1988 by the Director - John Frankenheimer, George Axelroyd and Frank Sinatra (all now deceased) in which Frank revealed how he sustained the permanent break to his finger during the fight scene with Chunjin (Henry Silva)  Also features - Director's Commentary   Nothing special other than the usual anecdotes on how wonderful the cast was on different shooting days    CASABLANCA (1942) - DVD viewed May 11 - 13  Directed by Michael Curtiz  Nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture Its other nominations were Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Cinematography Best Original Score(Dramatic or Comedy), Best Film Editing, Best Writing and Best Director  Won 3, Best Writing( now referred to as Adapted) Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture  Number 2 on the AFI Best American film list   DVD Special features include a detailed docummentary on the writing,casting and making of the film -  presented by the screen icon, Lauren Bacall

      THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH (1952)  Directed by Cecil B. DeMille  Nominated for 5 Academy Awards  Won 2 - Best Picture and Best Writing, Motion Picture Story   In my opinion,this is one of those times when the Academy's choice for the year does not hold up. How SHOW could have picked up Best Picture over HIGH NOON (nominated in 7 categories including Best Picture) is anyone's guess  It is possible that the Studio System (was coming into it's climax in the early 1950s) helped Cecil B. DeMille's pet project prevail over the others  My opinion is that it was a safe family movie about art and work that touched a 1950s nerve. It was certainly less controversial than HIGH NOON which had the McCarthysim subtext and was had it's screenplay adapted by Carl Foreman (one of the blacklisted members of the Hollywood community)  Special Features - None

      THE RED SHOES (1948)  Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressbuger  Nominated for 5 Academy Awards including Best picture and (then described as) Best Writing (Motion Picture) Won 2, Best Art - Set Decoration, Color and Best Music Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture  A Powell and Pressburger Classic. described as one of the most innovative and beautiful works of the cinema.  DVD Special Features - Documentary profile of the Red Shoes including interviews with renowned Cinematographer, Jack Cardiff - Recipient of the Honorary Academy Award(2000)  Considered a daring lift for the Post WW2 cinema era.  Innovative technic used has often been cited by contemporary filmmakers such as Spielberg,Coppola and Scorcese as having a strong on their work  Was not well received at first due to it's dark content. Ballet was regarded at an aspirational art form not suited to be dealt with in such a shocking and tragic way as shown by TRS. Even the tragic accident at the end of the film - the vivid imagery of the bloodied stockings by our heroine was considered too shocking for young viewers.
