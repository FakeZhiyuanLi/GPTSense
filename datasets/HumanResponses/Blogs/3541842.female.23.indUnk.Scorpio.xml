      From a friend.  I feel privileged to be invited in her blogspot.  She is such a prolific writer and this is attested by her  urlLink  poetry  .   On phases of lucidity   Lucidity may have phases.  For me, I still cannot discern with much certainty whether lucidity really has phases.  Lucidity--and that's it.  These days though, I have difficulty expressing myself.  Ghosts in the past resurrected because of my actions, intermingling with other factors.  This is a vicious cycle I am in.  Now, I am roaming around hurting people I love and cherish.  This has to stop, but first, I have to make a choice.  People in their late 30s or early 40s have this midlife crisis.  People in early 20s also have life crisis.  I believe that I am in the so-called quarter-of-life crisis.  My good friend, Rona, could prove to you that this stage exists.  This is a difficult stage and this is lucidity. I hate to whine but I cannot help it.   urlLink Saxifrage

      i watched spiderman 2 today. i dunno if i should say its a good movie or better than the first.  it is really hard to weigh now, now that ive thought bout it.  perhps because the person i watch it with was also a sight to watch.    ive never seen a person so sure with himself and yet appear so humble.  funny that he should be so free from inhibitions and yet composed. ironic now that he should be so young and determined. he even had a long term goal, heavens!   i am now imagining what it would have been like if i was some kind of a five feet six long legged morena with a face people would double take just to photograph it for their memories.i do not whine. i couldnt possibly want to look any different than i do now if i have to trade something valuable to me for it. it is not worth the risk. definitely not. thank you very much.  but if that cruel fate befall on me, id be the greatest, unbelievable egomaniac that ever lived.  i bet i would be.  as what my movie date mentioned.."if i was spider man, i wouldnt wear a mask. hell, id even pose for the girls and do autograph signing."  as honest as he can put it.  how wonderful if one could just be true to one's self. no inhibitions.  no i-cant-do-that-cause-they-would-think-i-am-a... no expectations to consider. no boundaries to assess in and out, back and front.   how wonderful it would have been if i told him the reason i am now loss on whether spiderman 2 is better than the first spiderman.  that smile. that face. i could take it to sleep anytime of the day. and id know il wake up okay. :).

      rainy season (by mrp)  I hate it when it rains and i am all alone makes me think of pain  that goes on and on the thoughts we shared,  the hugs we did we were so good,  why did u leave?  i hate it when it rains,  more so when hes here.. i thought of u often,  battling my fear the kisses on the forehead,  i misses you so we had the world,  why did you go?  closure is tedious, remembrance is pain your issue comes up  whenever it rains i hate it when it rains, more so the aftermath and find you're aint here  even the rain had stopped.  ------------------------------------  i am still on the rebound.   how funny that it is so easy to fall in love when one knows it will never work out.    oh, this is nothing to do with the poem. that poem is a fragment of the heavy rain that poured out last saturday night. im missing two people for two different reasons.  I was missing one because he owed me so much explanation. I was missing the other because he was simply not there. he tends to brighten up my night with so little effort.   we do not choose the ones we love. i would love to, really. one area i would really grab the opportunity to choose. if i could.  [sighs] we do not choose the ones we love.

      is it possible to have overlapping heartaches? or do i just have this big time obsession of having to consciously let myself undergo such madness.  i have not even cried hard for the other yet. not theres another one breaking an already broken heart. or is my heart really broken? i sometimes think its all in my mind.  the writer in me seems to find amusement on pretense.   what a funny way to pretend one is heartbroken..or in love.. or struggling towards recovery.  what a funny way.  and i hurt all the same.  what a funny way to hurt.

       ENSLAVED   Blemish me and tarnish me with thy smile,encapture me.  claim my thoughts and own my mind control my dreams, i'll never whine  make me thee make me thee with thy stare...enslaving me.     CLAIMED   the darkness swept over thy face a look as such i cannot place  do they reveal such arrogance  that thy believe dont stand a chance  thy grin i see swept o'er thy face you look at me and claimed my kiss  Thy say "let them woe you in vain." i am sole urs i'd better learn.    FREED    Free me, unbound me my mind wanders restore me  ungripped me, unpicked me my heart rebels release me.

      i thought it was too early to have one.  Midlife crisis doesnt start till you are forty.  But funny, we seem to be undergoing such at twenty four.  Twenty something crisis, you may call it.  We just call it the stage that everything else sucked and the ones that don't are not part of our lives.  life sucks at 24.  or at least, mine and the lives of those that i knew.  we have dreams of leaving the country for quick cash.  We might not always admit it outright but good money is certainly not here where its on arms' length.  We have plans of buying things we wanted to add in our collection, as soon as we can settle the backpayments on those things we bought that we cannot remember.  life sucks at 24. We rejected the people who could have loved us beyond what we would have want, over some asshole who made us feel loved for the moment and left us hanging afterwards.  We go in and out of relationships claiming we never really wanted to stay in there longer than needed; without even really understanding that there was never a need to stay in a relationship we dont have plans sticking in.  life sucks at 24. One unhappy event in our lovelife and the rest of our world tumbles down. We keep talking about how hurt we feel in a futile hope to hear the same words said to us by our confidante, and yet, refuses to accept the humble truth that it helps cause they would never understand the pain we have been through.  life sucks at 24.  We used to have a clear sight of where we will be five years from college graduation.  We envisioned a large office and a good pay.  We saw ourselves with the right folks at the right time.  Everything was doable, if not, possible.  We didn't see ourselves complaining about being 24.  We didn't think being one has its steady moments. We thought of being 24 and having our ups and downs big time.  life sucks at 24.  But ego has it that we will never admit it.  We can always find other people in worse state than we are now.  We can always justify more successful folks: things happened for them.  We believe happiness is a state of mind.  We are what we think.  We have the ability and freedom to run our lives.  My life sucks for the moment.  Though ego has it that I'd rather crawl than admit it, it is the truth.  My life sucks for the moment. A promotion here and another degree earned there could only beams me temporarily.  A heartache here and another screw up there could only pained me momentarily.  My life was never a box of chocolates and not because i hate eating them but because the rest of the population loves consumming them.  My life sucks for the moment.  But i am gonna sleep on this and wake up refreshed.  I am biologically 24.  That is all what there is to that. I am neither too young or too old to make a decision. Happiness is a state of mind.  I have the ability and freedom to run my life.  Let my life sucks at 24.  I know I will learn.
