        Went to a horrible show last night. We only stayed for 1 act.   Thanks to Ryan for having us over at his house. It was a fun time hanging out with the cats, his sisters, and watching some Street Fighter II Turbo on the Super Nintendo.   -   Today was alot of fun. A group went to Falling Water (sorry Matthew). It was fun. Lots of jumping off rocks into the water, sliding around on algae rocks, and wondering where in the world Bobby and Chris were the whole time.   Hope everyone had a fun holiday. I'm off to get some pizza and chill. Halo is calling my name though....it's been a few days.

       Well today has been a sweat so far. I played drums at church which is always fun, because I'm not really a drummer. I'm moving out of my apartment today. It's kinda weird. I've changed so much while being there.    I will probably be staying at the Blaylock house for a few days because I'll be homeless until Tuesday or Wednesday.    Currently disliking: the stairs I have to climb to get to my apartment.

        Lately I've been sleeping on the floor for about the past 2 weeks. I've come to realize that it may not be the best way to sleep. Which brings me to an entirely different question.    What did people way back when, such as Adam and Eve, sleep on? Leaves for clothing....I doubt they had a pillowtop california king mattress to catch some zzzzz's.    I found the floor very comfortable for about 10 days. Now it seems to be hindering me more than helping. Maybe it should be done in moderation. Nonetheless, I shall try the futon again.

      Halo has to be the ultimate video game of all time! It will forever withstand the test of time and constant evolution of technology.   Bungie, I love you so much for designing this game. Please hurry with Halo 2.

            YES! I love 80s hair-metal guitar playing fools in my place of work. It makes my day so much brighter to watch someone so painfully go up and down a guitar neck while straining their neck out and making quite possibly the ugliest face I've ever seen.   Rock and Roll will never die!                How does Jerome (not my brother) @ Taco John's do it. They offer "generous portions of freshly made Mexican food. Cooked to my order. Served to me by friendly people. And all for a fair and honest price."   Currently Eating:  Taco John's #2 w/ side of cheese dip

       Las Palmas was short-staffed....which means no birthday singing. It was a good time anyways. Thanks to my homies for the small ceremony.  I'm at work and just counted inventory for about 10000 sets of guitar strings. How fun!

       Today is my 23rd birthday. I graduated last week....didn't even go to the ceremony.   The band came up with a new song that alot of you will like. It's very interesting, now it's up to Wes to make up some words.   Pray, pray, pray, pray. God wants to hear you.

       This may be the last post for a while. Cornerstone is tomorrow. 4AM sucks. We should have done all of this junk earlier. I'm getting what I deserve right now.    Once we arrive I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but right now is just stupid. It's nearly 10pm and we're still not asleep. Sounds like the trip to Nashville - except that was only 6 hours.    Anyone who reads this please keep all of us Russvegas kids and anyone else going in your prayers. There will be much driving.    I'm gonna take my laptop and see if I can find a wireless connection somewhere.......

       Well, I've been told the show went great! Thanks to everyone for coming out. It was good to see many friends there, the numbers are growing - it's awesome! I had a lot of fun making some new xfriendsx too.  After the show,  urlLink Kasey  and his family were unbelievably hospitable. I love that guy (and Hal too!). I wish he was in a band so I could go watch him play, I bet he'd be fun to watch. I guess I'll have to settle for watching his brother in  urlLink Very Much So .  - Now for the good stuff. I got a sunburn on my shoulders yesterday. :) It's really splotchy and I think almost kind of cool. This of course came from swimming - our new favorite hobby. Halo is getting a bit old (we need Halo 2). At least swimming keeps me active, otherwise playing music is the only time I burn any calories.  Check out some of Dr. Inch's books. If you like reading smart people literature, he's for you. I can't make it through half a page without having to read something over again. He goes to my church and does a sermon every once in a while. It's so precious - he's pretty old and he wears the same "bowling-style" shirt every time he preaches.

       TONIGHT!   urlLink deas vail , india, and  urlLink abel  scroll down for more info.  ---  In other news, I really really wish I had more patience. The most ridiculous things bother me. Right now I just would much rather be hanging out with my crew.  Maybe some of you people will start post something today so I'll have something to draw my attention away from work.  Currently: Twiddling my thumbs.  I am so ready for the show tonight. Me = emo boy. I wanna dance during the music.

       Everyone should go to the Mexico Mexico & Encomium show this Thursday. Check the  urlLink Encomium  xanga for directions.  Yes I know, another Tom Hanks movie. What can I say, he's a good actor. He picks his roles really well.  We've been swimming quite a bit lately. Fun stuff, maybe I'll get a tan and be cool. Wait....emo boys don't have tans! Pale is the way to go.  Be sure to check back for info. on the next  urlLink deas vail  show this Saturday in Cabot. We'll be playing with  urlLink Abel  and India (who isn't really a band, but used to be Green Olive Tree......which makes them worthy of watching.)

       I like Tom Hanks....maybe I'm just really into cheesy romantic comedy movies. He just does great at it. I went to see Terminal last night. I enjoyed it.    deas vail needs to spark a new song before the show in Cabot next week. It will happen........oh yes it will.

      Yep, played a show. Xpressions in Fayetteville is a dirty place. I wasn't quite comfortable with the setting to say the least. And Kevin and Clint rocked it with Midway.  Thanks to our RussHomies crew and the other cool kids from the Carder family for coming out to support.

       Show tonight. I will rock everyone out with my crazy movement. Then, I will make them weep with my sweet fiddle bow action.  Ok that was pretty stupid, I'm full of it right now.  Pray that it won't rain or be too hot on the way to Fayetteville tonight. I still have no AC in my car so the windows must be rolled down or it turns into a sauna.

      There was a guy named Buck Star on "Last Comic Standing" last night. He went to every city they had an audition at.....I think 8 different major cities all over the US.  The judges bought him lunch once, and at the last tryout they gave him a spot in the live show that night.  I think in his case it was well deserved. Buck Star was really the only reason I watched the rest of the show. I wanted to see if really was going to continue to show up in New York, Nashville, Florida, etc. I think they ought to offer him a hosting spot - such as that maroon Nyquist.  He had great personality, just no jokes. Feed him lines. He'd be funnier than Carrot Top.  Thanks to those who are saying no to Pedro. It's awesome to know that you people do enjoy our show and our message. I'm inspired to know that many of you aren't just showing up because you're our friends.

       Played a show last night. I had fun. Some some cool bands.  One in particular called Empathy. Although they are changing their name soon. They were kind of younger but showed some pretty good stuff I thought.  After the Tragedy of course melted a few faces off. They are pretty fun to watch.  Ihop after the show. I think Waffle House is better. The staff is much more friendly/crazy.

      I have been called many things - yet in a recent comment on my xanga I was called a chameleon. I thought that was cool.  Chameleons change alot to blend in with their surroundings. Seriously, that has got to be one of the coolest things God did for an animal (beyond giving them wings to fly).  I want to be able to change colors! Guess I'm stuck with my current epidermis. How boring.

        Cool Hand Luke will not be at Vino's on Aug 27th. deas vail and Philmore are still playing. I'm very very sad to hear they dropped off that show.    Maybe you'll have time to come watch deas vail and still go to Juanita's for the other show at 10. Hopefully many people will be encouraged at the Blindside and Me Without You show. Listen to Bradley at that show, his poetry is meaningful and uplifting.   While CHL is a great band, it is really inspiring to see a band of their caliber get up and bring the word of God to showgoers. It is awesome that they don't dumb down their message for anyone. May God bless them in whatever he has for them on the aforementioned night.   Fayetteville - themusichall.net - this Saturday.

      The Butterfly Effect wasn't that great. If you haven't seen it, avoid it. If you must watch it because Ashton Kutcher has such a hot body you can't stand, then DO NOT watch the director's cut. The theatrical ending wasn't very good, but the director's cut was HORRIBLE! I laughed because it was so stupid.....kind of like at the end of Mission Impossible 3 when Tom Cruise did a front wheelie and spun his motorcycle around all while shooting some bad guys with a really dorky xtuffx look on his face.

           Check the  urlLink deas vail  xanga again.  I bought some donuts this morning. The apple fritter is good. I can't wait for the donut holes. Paradise donuts has the best donut holes. I like Krispy Kreme better for glazed donuts.  Along with my donut holes comes a Sobe. I really like Sobes, except for all the creamy ones. Grape Grog and Energy both taste really good.  For some reason, I'm really awake right now. Usually at 9:30 in the morning I'm still half asleep. Maybe I'll play some Yahoo! games and half some fun.

       Thanks to our friends to coming to the show. It was fun. The Pale is really fun to watch live. They give it all they got!    So in other news. My mustache thing had been well received. I'm glad the ppl at the show got a sneak preview.    I love playing games.yahoo.com - the graffiti game is hilarious. I played it with my cousin at work today and we were cheating. It was funny.    So if you want to try a new trick. Hit Alt+F4. It's some kind of programming code thing.    Later.

      New  urlLink deas vail  website layout.   I think it's awesome. Tell me what you think. You might have to refresh the page to get it to update.   We have a show at Vino's tomorrow with The Pale and Pants. The Pale puts on a fun live show some come out and watch. Pants has been described as having "some of the most SOLID musicians in Little Rock". I don't know if the guy who told me can even play an instrument. So 50/50 that they'll be good too.

      Yesterday flew by. Went to Vino's to watch Fletcher &amp; India. Cool beans.   Thanks to the folks who came to the show. I hope anyone who got one of my Krispy Kremes enjoyed it to the max. I know it wasn't the loudest of shows, but I still had fun and hope you all did too.   Empathy did really well, except the night manager said they were too loud and pulled the plug on the PA system in the middle of a song. It was funny, they didn't quite know what to do. I think they were kind of scared too, the lady was pretty crazed in the heat of the moment. We definitely played louder than they did. I was suprised she didn't get upset at us.

       urlLink Cornerstone  came and went. Time does fly when you're having fun -  urlLink deas vail  shows, watching other bands, great worship. Unfortunately when things weren't so fun, time was dragging along slow slow slow.     urlLink David Crowder ,  urlLink Jason Morant , and  urlLink Cool Hand Luke / urlLink Aireline / urlLink Anathallo  all had awesome worship sets.     urlLink The Pale  actually put on the most surprising show.  urlLink deas vail  will be playing with them at  urlLink Vino's  next Saturday. Fans of  urlLink OkGo  and fun rock type stuff will like them alot.     urlLink Mexico Mexico  rocked it on the impromptu stage. I took a venture to the pit during a song. I borrowed a motorcycle helmet and bandana which both protected me from xkidsx.    We played a few shows. One was on a stage about 8 feet in the air, it was weird, and really slippery.    Unfortunately I lost my wallet on the way home in Missouri! We stopped at a gas station called Boomland in Benton, MO and I bought some food at McDonald's  . So far no one has turned it in. I hope someone who needed some extra money found it. I only had about $80 in it but that could really help out someone who was starving or needed gas money.     urlLink deas vail  has a show this Saturday at a coffee shop in Ft. Smith. When I figure out more info. I'll post it asap.     urlLink Kasey , thanks for the dedication. It took me a while to get through but I liked it. God bless you and your family.

      Back to the studio today, hopefully I'll get the guitar tracks nearly finished. Can't think of anything else important concerning me.    urlLink Wes  gets his wisdom teeth pulled today. It would be fun to mess with him while he's on the goofy gas.   Tomorrow is  urlLink Kasey's  birthday. Everyone wish him Happy Birthday.

       Last Tuesday's show was all too wonderful. People were dedicating their lives to Christ. What more could one ask for? I was happy that Jesus let me experience that. I've never been in the middle of something like that before.  Everyone from the Wonder Tour & the Cameron people were so awesome. Thanks to each and every one of you.  And here's some shoutouts. Thanks to Jamie, Heather, Rachel, Haley, Jon, Aimee &amp; anyone else from the Ft. Smith area (sorry I can't remember all your names.) It was really cool to see you guys there. I didn't see most of you after the show so I hope you got to stay. Sorry it took so long, the wait was definitely for a good cause.  Back to the show. We played last and the kids were ready for some rock. They were throwing beach balls everywhere; must have been about 25 of those things. It was like a Spring Break show on tv except it was all for Jesus. We ended our set w/ Light of the World (Here I Am to Worship), and everyone joined in to worship with us. Again, what more could I ask for to be used in such a way.  Here's the kicker. They had a portable toilet inside a chuck wagon. You might think that alone is awesome. Well.....it was flushable too! That thing is definitely in my Top 10 most interesting bathroom list.

      Wow, there was quite a few folks at the Music Hall last night. My apologies for the $8 cover, that's the standard fee there I guess. I feel that it is quite a bit high for local type acts considering the facilities themselves too.   Thanks to everyone who came, especially to those who helped with merch, drove for a while to get there, and/or brought someone with them. I hope we were encouraging and entertaining at the same time.   I danced a little in the pit and did my helmet routine. Hopefully Brian will be able to take over in the future. The pit takes more energy than I have.   Someone set a smoke bomb off in front of my car and then everyone was like, "your car is on fire!" and I freaked for a second or two. It was a good joke, although I don't think the person that set it off even meant it to be a joke on me or my car.   PM Today and Hold Your Own were both great. Hadn't seen either one of them before. I think The Wedding amazed at their transformation from the last months of recording and being in Nashville. I like watching Kevin hang off the ceiling and do the backwards jump/fall into the crowd. If they keep that up everyone will love them when they embark on this upcoming tour.
