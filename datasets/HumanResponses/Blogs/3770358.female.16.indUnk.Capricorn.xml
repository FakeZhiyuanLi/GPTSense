      You don’t just get to where I am in life by just doing nothing. No, you have to purposely try to do nothing – really try, not just be lazy. Forget eating regularly, forget going to the bathroom, don’t even let sleep take you, just sit there dead, like a rock. And then it’ll happen.  First you’ll hear the little scuffling noise, like a herd of little mice are coming to creep into your kitchen and scurry around the floor for bits of dropped food. Then, it gets worse, a dark moaning sound, like the noise you hear when a woman mourns the loss of her unborn baby. It continues, steadily rising in pitch, until your ears cannot bear them anymore and you too shriek, madly pressing your hands against your ears in order to block out the sound. But it can’t be blocked out…  I have to be in my own world for this to work. So do you too, probably.  And then, when it feels as if the world is going to explode, you suddenly feel a wave of calm, of eager happiness. They just appear then, without warning, without word. Your happiness will fade away quickly into confusion. For still, they shall offer no word, only silent glaring, perhaps appraising if they happen to favor you slightly. And so you sit there, unsure of what to do… Grimace painfully, wishing they were gone – and regret the day you ever wished to be a part of this plan. No, instead you must rather glare back, defiantly, daring them to edge you on, even as your insides slowly begin to solidify into a cold mass of terrified flesh. And then, when they’ve deemed you’ve suffered enough, (assuming you do consent to their planning, for if you wish them off and reject them no amount of suffering shall ever be enough for them), a simple blink of their eyes and you’re whisked away, to be treated and informed.  Why such harsh treatment for the fearful, selfcentered ones? Well, don’t go around taunting them with your invitation to be invited yourself. No one calls the beings on accident; so really, the sufferers are merely getting what they deserve, punishment for their wasteful stupidity and irresponsible curiosity. Don’t go regretting what you’ve wished for – be smart enough when wishing in the first place so that second wishes are never needed.  But I have digressed, forgive me and let me return to the topic at hand.  So, you’ve been called away, and all you know is your own world, your mind. You hear and feel the worlds of those around you, yea even of those you care so much about – but none of it registers, none of it matters. You are too concerned with the missions set forth to you by the Aged Ones, those who have been at this for many years and know what must be accomplished. It’s not easy work, being messengers of the Gods of the Universe, travelling back and forth, endlesssly, carrying messages, urgent, offhand, humorous, inquisitive, but always, always, endless….  But, someone has to do it, someone has to be able to give up their life, to relate to the different worlds what the gods above wish to be known. And, sometimes, to conceal what the gods above wish to be unknown...  *rest to be written and all to be revised later*

      Is there any one thing with only good or only bad consequences, results, etc.?  I don't think so. Absolutes are too harsh for this world, for evolution. Within limited settings they work, but there are too many perspectives for one absolute truth.    And yet, does the alternative work instead?...
