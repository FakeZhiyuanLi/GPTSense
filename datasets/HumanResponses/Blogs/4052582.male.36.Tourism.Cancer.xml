      Good Morning all:    Not much going on.  Yesterday was a do nothing type of day.  I watched tv and slept.  On Wed I did do some dishes and clean the fish tank and finish laundry.  Today is my work day, I am going to work on painting the computer room and also work on the yard if it doesn't rain.  Then tomorrow it is back to work. Oh well, life goes on.  I will be posting pictures of what the progress is on the computer room painting.  It will be fast and fun though.  So I am really looking forward to it.  The computer however may be down for a couple days till I get the project done.  Probally for the best because I want this room to look good.  I really wish I knew where the desk was at my parents house I am allowed to have.  I'd love to put that up in place of this big clunky desk. Guess I have to wait till they come home from vacation.   Well, that is it from here.  See ya on the net..............  Richard =)

      Hi all:  &nbsp;This is my first time with blogger so please be patient with me.&nbsp; I have been going through lots of blog changes trying to find something I really like, so far I like blogger the best.  &nbsp; The title  Why Be Normal?&nbsp;  Came about because of a T-shirt I found at Target store.&nbsp; My fiancee told me I should buy it because I always say it.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; Now I am using that for my blog title.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I just purchased my first house, so this blog will not only talk about life in general, but my experiences of being a first time home owner and all the fun projects I am going to be doing.&nbsp; My first project right now is painting the computer room and windows and two new doors.&nbsp; I think I am more excited about the new windows because we really need them and will make the heating and cooling better.  &nbsp; Well, That is about it for now, I will write more later on.&nbsp; I have to get to bed shortly because I work at 11:00 pm tonight.&nbsp; But then I am off Wed, Thursday and Friday.   So, See you on the net............   Richard =)

      Morning all:   I supose it is safe to write about this now. The Vice President is coming sometime today and is staying over night at the hotel.  The place has been turned upside down sense the secret service has arrived.  The press groups come sometime today too.  It has been a real long week and its only Tuesday.  I was so tired last night I actually fell asleep just at the last segment of my program I watch  urlLink History Detectives .  I love watching that show on Mondays.     So much for rain yesterday again. It did for about 15 minutes and that was it. Not much to make a dent in my lawn that is getting so dry.  It is typical August here, dry as a bone. They have been saying rain all week and it misses us.  I want a great down pour.   I am going to go ahead and try to see if I can do a full restore of the computer in the time I have left before John picks me up for work.  Wish me luck.   See Ya on the Net........  Richard =)

      Hi all,  Still here, but was a busy weekend. We had a display at the dog show this weekend and I worked by myself all weekend.  It was a crazy day, because all the families with dogs checked out and lots of beding was brought down.  I can only imagine what we have left this morning.  On a political note, Dick Channey is coming to La Crosse on Tuesday. He is staying here at the hotel.    Time for work, I will post more later when I have some free time, just wanted to let you know I am still around.  See ya on the net......  Richard =)
