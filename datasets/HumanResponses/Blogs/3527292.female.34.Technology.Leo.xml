      Sent out some resumes on company time with company equipment... but isn't it the company that is putting me out of work?  I feel better now that I have an updated resume and cover letter, but still have a constant nagging stomach/head ache... it only gets worse if I think about it.  I need a job.. and quick... but this situation really makes me question my skills.  My brothers says I'm a real tech nerd because I have a blog.  People don't realize how easy some of this stuff is... i guess i don't either.  Leaving work a little early today... need to get jr's hair cut and shop for b-day and grad gifts.  Having dinner tonight with the StonyBrook clan at Olive Garden... sinfully good cliche restaurant.... yummmm

      it's funny... i seem to go around in circles... my life is like a venn diagram (is that the word I'm looking for).... my circle with derrick just goes around and around and never completely breaks, although sometimes it's more like an isosceles triange.... and then now hooking back up with HS friends... that's more like a very long oval... it's stretched out so far and thinned out but never went away... you look at all these circles in your life and how they mix and mingle but constantly changing like a kaliedoscope.... my deep thought for the day  BBQ at Scott's was fun, hope it continues and a new social outlet remains constant D asked why I was being such a bitch... does he have to ask... it actually feels good.. but I can't help but feel insecure all the time going shopping tonight.. haircut for jr., b-day & grad gifts, baby gifts
