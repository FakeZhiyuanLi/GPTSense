      Wolfram hat auch zugesagt. Jetzt fehlen noch    Kathrin, deren Adresse ich (bis jetzt) nicht habe   Caro   Astrid, die vielleicht gar nicht in Berlin ist   Rainer, aber das ist bestimmt nur Formsache   Horst   Thorsten   Kaulich, aber der weiß nocht nichts von seinem Glück    Hoffentlich melden die sich alle mal bei mir.

      nervt. Mein Schul-Englisch ist einfach so schwach (hatte ja auch mehr Griechisch und Latein). Aber ist besser als dieses Denglisch. Schlimme Worte. Aber was sagt man zu "posten" auf deutsch?  Aprospos Griechisch. Rainer und ich wollten dieses Jahr ein Altgriechen-Meeting veranstalten. Mal sehen, was draus wird. Hab noch nicht richtig viel Zusagen. Nur Claudia hat mündlich zugesagt. Errinere mich daran, daß ich sie nach Ihrer Mail-Adresse frage. Hab die jetzt schon zum xten Mal vergessen.  Mein Tag heute: Ins Restaurant fahren, Lautsprecher reparieren, abends im Restaurant helfen. Die Vespa muß ich wohl morgen machen. Mist. Mir fehlt ne Schraube (und 'ne andere ist lose). Im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes...

      I was with a few friends at the Oststrand. That is a very nice spot at the EastSideGallery. You can have a drink at the River Spree and watch the sun going down over Berlin. I love it.

      is up and running. Yahooooooo! But (there has to be always a but) the exhaust is broken. This means another few hours of screwing.  By the way, I bought a new helmet. It looks very nice (I think I have to buy a digicam to prove it)...

      There happened a lot the last days:   First:  My parents went visiting my old (not so healthy) grandma. Poor little granny... My father, who is not so young himself (*1927), told me, if he would be in the state of my grandmother he would rather like to have a poison pill. That's all so sad. I don't want to see my grandma anymore because I like the memorys I have about her and I am afraid to destroy them.   Second:  On wednesday called me C. She is a nice young girl. I was a bit surprised. It is true I tried to reach her once in the past, but I just caught her brother who was quite rude. I told him my name and sayed I would call later again. I didn't. But I also didn't expect him to tell her that I called. And plus I didn't expect her to call at all.  We want to go dancing next week.   Third:  Yesterday a few old friends of mine and me met at the "La Batea" and had a few drinks together because Florian went today with his girlfriend for a short trip to Paris. Lucky bastard.  Martin says: "Viel Spaß, Flo. Mach' viele Photos. Und genieß mit Pamela die Stadt der Liebe ;-)" The waitress at the "La Batea" went today to Barcelona, like she told me yesterday. Happy her. She is a nice girl. I like her much. ¡Buen viaje!   Fourth:  The last two days I spend at the home of my parents. My first ex-girlfriend is home-sitting their house and we talked a lot about evrything. I liked it a lot. I didn't see her for years. Life is strange. Good old girl.

      ... and I have done not really much yet. Yesterday I brought Ciro and his wife Barbara with their two beautiful girls to the airport. Now they're in Napels and let themselves burn by the sun. Happy people. By the way, Ciro is one of the owners of  urlLink the restaurant . Afterwards I ate with Francesco a tasty pasta with mushrooms (yellow boletuses) at  urlLink his restaurant .  Today the weather is as bad as it used to be this summer. Pouring rain... Later I will meet my brother. Perhaps we will take a few photos or hide in the darkroom. A prospos: I have a few digitalized pictures now. If I have a little spare time I will put them on this site. Next week...

      So this is the  urlLink iTMS  in Europe. It looks a bit boring, not sensational at all, hmm. But it reminds me to buy a  urlLink new song . Perhaps it is the  urlLink 100.000.000st song  bought in the iTMS. I would truly appreciate a new  urlLink notebook .

      until I have to send in my thesis. It's terrible. I'm much to lazy. I hope evrything will go well. As  urlLink Shakespeare  said:  All's well that ends well , or something like that...

      Hi out there, today I start my brand new blog. Before I begin a little about me: I'm writing my thesis in media-related computer science. I live in a little apartment with two chambers in the south of Berlin (Friedenau), it's very nice with two balconys but thanks to my lazyness it's a mess. In my spare time I play the piano and take photos. I spend much of my time at  urlLink this restaurant , helping a bit and entertaining (annoying) the guests with my piano-music.  PS: I try to write in English for the international readers. Yet I don't feel comfortable with that.
