       It was a pretty good day, and I was feeling free because I decided to quit the cheering squad! Ahhhh, life. You can actually begin to appreciate it more when you have nothing on your agenda. I went shopping with my friend in SM Manila, and it was great! Though I only bought one blouse, it was okay. Shopping really makes me feel good. After that the driver picked me up and I went to Festival Mall by myself. I just really like shopping alone, I don't know why. After another shopping marathon, I settled in SBC to have a nice tall glass of iced mocha.  While I waited for our driver, (he was picking my mom up at ATC)I contemplated the things i've done over the past weeks. Sigh... it's been real good.

      God, how I hate that day! Well, except for the fact that there were no classes, it was terrible. My friends and I decided to go shopping at Megamall, I actually rode an FX! It was a pretty gross experience, I never want to ride one again! There was this man behind me, and he kept on talking to me and looking at me through the rearview mirror. I pretended not to hear him and I shut my eyes, I panicked when he said "Miss bigay mo na sakin number mo" I told the driver to stop and I jumped out in front of Shangri-La. My friends didn't want to go in there though, I don't know why. Shangri-La has the best shops and restaurants around! Well, after that terrifying experience, we had to walk to go to Megamall, my feet hurt though it wasn't that far. God, I miss having a car and driver.

      There was this cute guy at school. HE looked like the lead singer of Hoobastank! Hahaha. Well, there was an MTV Pilipinas booth at our school, and he was asking people to cast their votes for Best Act, Best Whatever, etc. So as I was passing by, he was like "Hey, vote now!" and was handing out the ballots, and I was like "Sorry, i've got to go somewhere" and he was like, "Please,please please!" Hehe. So I gave in. Too bad he likes Justin Timberlake. Turn Off.    God, it rained today... and my umbrella broke. Good thing our driver picked me up. Don't know what to do. Ugh, tomorrow i'll have to face my terror prof again.

      Not really though. I'm feeling quite bored. College life is fun, except for our terror Filipino prof. Honestly, I don't know why she's like that! She's like, "oh, i'm so smart and everything, your dumb and have no right to be in my class!" Yeah right. Well, today was kinda fun. The only decent mall here is SM Manila, so that's where I usually hang-out. I was feeling kind of down today, so I went shopping! Gosh, Php400 a day is not enough! I can't be expected to buy from sales! God, I really have to slim down!    I didn't attend my P.E. class today, so what? I hate softball. I just have so many things on my mind right now. I think i'll go shopping again...

      I miss the place!!! I miss Kahrstadt, Hamburg, Travemunde and Rahlstedt. Haha. Evrything reminds me of Germany. When I smell coffee, I remember Tchibo, this fantastic shop that sells everything coffee. When I go to the bank, I remember the bank in Travemunde,&nbsp;when I look at my diamond ring, I remember that my dad bought it for me at Christ, a jewelry store in Travemunde. &nbsp;I&nbsp;miss the milkshakes in that little cafe... God, I haven't been to Germany for 2 years. Last year because I had to take summer classes, and this year because I had to&nbsp;go for interviews in UST and enrollment. Next year though, i'm coming back!!!!! I miss our little house, and wonderful Steak Tartar. &nbsp;&nbsp;
