      For the first time in the year, I slept at 9.30 pm last night. The weariness had not faded away yet after one long night of sleep. It’s something inside, deep inside. Something that is sick of this world, things around me, something growth tired of everything.  Really hope this feeling would go away very soon before it leads to serious consequences like before. Really hope it does, it’s affecting my normal life, or, should I say, affecting my present “life”. It’s not normal at all.  I’m still searching for myself, deep from within. I had grown detached from this world. Nothing seems to matter to me anymore, TV, jokes and food; things that I would do everyday and like them had become nothing to me, meaningless. I used to love them a lot, I remember, but the passion is gone.  I seem to live in my own world now, with nobody around. Guess it’s because I can’t find myself yet. “I’m” lost in the mist of masking and splitting personalities. Which is the true “I”, I wonder. I really want to find.  I only feel relax when I’m alone at night, feel true when I’m with my drama friends. Even with my clique. I feel lost. I’m not myself with them, with everybody. I wonder why whenever I’m with my drama clique, I feel very true and real, though it sounds ironic. Maybe it is because during my worse time in life, they are the ones there for me, to comfort me. They only know a little but not all, yet they are able to give me support and comfort.  With each passing day, the pain did not pass away but instead it becomes more intense. The pain is killing me. I can feel it engulfing my internal, my heart, and my lungs. My chest aches. I can’t breathe. Why…  The long for that somebody to appear becomes stronger. It’s getting out of control. It is stupid to have this feeling, I know it’s stupid and idiotic, but the feeling and urge is strong. My life is in a complete mess now. I have never thought of writing blog, think it’s meaningless to write such things on the web, but I find comfort and console here. It’s like talking to somebody and expressing my thoughts. Maybe after I have recovered, I might jeer at myself for doing such a thing.  Life is meaningless, yet I’m searching for it. Life is meaningful, yet I’m still searching for it. I’m never living my own life, yet I’m still searching for it. I’m always living my own life, yet I’m searching for it.

      Feeling rather depressed lately. This feeling come back every now and then, just like an old friend. Its return had never failed to strike me hard unexpectedly, like being backstabbed. The pain is intense beyond description.  I am a perfectionist who asks for unrealistic idealistic perfections in life, including my family. It is childish yet I grew up with it, thanks to all the myths and fairy tales I was told since young. This idealistic image is shattered as I grew up in my family.  Since young, I’m very jealous and envy of friends around me. They often told me about their Sunday trips to beaches and hawker centers and the birthday presents they received from their dad. I didn’t know why my dad is different. He had never remembered my birthday, had never gotten me a present or initiate to take me out for a trip. I really didn’t really understand. My closest cousin, Meng, shows a great contrast with me. He got everything he wants from my uncle and my uncle would always take Meng out for dinner every Sunday. I admit I was very jealous, even to the extent I hated him, so much that I wish I could be replace him. That was when I was young. Childish and foolish thinking.  As a child, they thought I was ignorant about lots of things. But I did notice quite a lot. I saw how my elder brother, How, came home from school and then locked himself up in his room. As long as my dad is at home, he would be inside his room, even for dinner. I had never seen him talked to dad before. I wondered why then. All I could see then was the certain look in his eyes. I didn’t know what that was. But as I grew older, I recalled and realized it was hatred that I saw in his eyes.  When I was five, I recalled that the only person who can talk comfortably with dad and made him smile is my second brother, Heng. He had his own ways. How would only hide in his room though the two brothers were still as close. Only I was left alone. Soon after, I took over Heng’s role for some reason. Perhaps it was because Heng had grown up. I remembered one day when How threw a chair at me from a distance about 4 metres away, for reason I could not recall. His anger and hatred displayed through his actions on me caught me dumbfounded. As a kid, I couldn’t figure out the reason, but soon I knew why.  The days when I was the apple of my dad’s eyes were good though he still never remember my birthday or got me any presents. But I still sensed his love and care for me. Soon, I realized the concern he had showed began to pour over. His way of showing his love suffocates me. I was like a chess piece under his control. I was not allowed to go out and had to obey everything he said. When he said you should bathe, you have to go, when he said you have to sleep, you have to, without fail. This overwhelming concern made me feel like a walking dead with no mind of my own.  He did that to my mum as well, even worse. He only allowed her to go to market and nowhere else. Can you ever imagine that a woman had never gone out to other places other than the market? I used to hide in a corner and see how my mum cried. They would fight over the slightest things and my dad would swear and curse my mum. He even threatened to kill her and force her to jump off from the flat. I saw her cry everyday, her eyes now swollen from all the crying. As I watched, hatred grew inside me. It started to attack my body and the conflict between my love for him and the hatred begin to tear my heart apart slowly, amplifying the pain.  As I grew older, I understand that dad had to work very hard to feed us; hence he could not afford to be like other dads. I understand. But the worsening relationship between my parents continues. I continued seeing my mum cried and my heart ached for her. After I came back from school, she would tell me everything that my dad had done. She told me how my dad had affairs with another girl before giving birth to me and how badly he treated my mum. I listened, and I was poisoned. Day after day, doses and doses of poison were fed to me. The hatred for him was even more intense. At times, I really didn’t wish to listen to my mum anymore, but I knew I have to as my mum need a listener.  At this crucial period, he dealt me another blow that I would never forget. He played in stocks and lost all our savings, his, my mum’s and mine. Eventually he threatened to sell our flat. These were the worse period of my teenage lives. Relationships were worsened and conflicts and hatred were amplified. My parents almost ended up in a divorce. If my brother and I had not cried in front of them begging, they would have done so. But maintaining a broken marriage is even more difficult now.  Life is in a big mess, everything is wrong, nothing is right. Things were all out of control. We lost all our savings with only about 10k left. The sense of insecurity strikes me. What am I going to do if either of us came down with illness? My mind couldn’t take all these. My dad had changed, totally, to somebody I couldn’t recognize. He is already imperfect, now it was worse. For the 3 years of my sec lives, I had to go for counseling and to seek shrinks for depressants. Those days really suck…  Now life is back to normal again after a long battle. I was seriously injured. Though it seems normal again but deep now in our hearts we know the conflicts and hatred are still intact. I had tried all means to mask my feelings and every time I show my true feelings my brothers would attack me. It was my job to keep the family conflict buried and not to resurface since only I was living with dad. They assume it was easy. No, it wasn’t, they didn’t know because they had long moved out. I was bitten and slapped again and again for my attempts to revive the situation till I’m tired. Nothing is going to help save the situation. My last resort would be to mask myself, to put on an act. For the next two years things were rather under control with only occasional frays.  It was like a time bomb, ready to explode anytime and I know I would not be prepared for it. I had to continue masking my true self to delay this explosion as long as possible. I was successful till now and nothing had happened. Everybody was faking everything so as to prevent the ultimate tragedy too.  However the poison in me still runs deep. I know very well where I stand. I am just an accident who my dad had wanted to give away. He refused to visit me when I was born. I shouldn’t be here to disturb their peaceful life. Without me, my dad would not be stressed up about and money and played in stocks. Without me, my brothers would still be living happily with mum and dad. I felt very guilty. This guilt is even worse than the conflict between my love and hatred for dad.  Having masked myself for two years and be the clown at home, I had totally lost myself. I learned to be evil, practical and critical to protect myself. I could not afford to let myself get hurt again. I learned how to be a clown, a stupid clown to be laughed, for entertainments sake, without feeling lousy. That is just shameless in short. I had grown used to it. The worst is I became very sensitive and read a lot into things. To me, everything poses as a danger to me, my natural instinct made me be aware of everybody around me. I trust nobody and to a certain I am putting up an act in front of them. But now, I am really very tired. I want to stop all these right now, before my mind split between the true and false me.  My true self was locked up somewhere deep in my heart where I could no longer find it. But it still haunts me very often. At night when everybody was asleep, I would be crying alone. Boys shouldn’t cry. I told myself not to cry anymore ever since I told myself I had to put on a mask for as long as my dad and mum were alive. But the pain, emptiness and fear were intense. When people look at me and my family, who would ever understand how unbearable these feelings are. I really wish there is someone there for me, to encourage me to carry on for I fear I might give up halfway through. Deep in my heart, my true self had yearned for somebody to free it. Till now I am still unable to find that someone but I truly believe there is one out there, waiting for me and I really hope I can find that someone soon in my life to release the voice in me.
