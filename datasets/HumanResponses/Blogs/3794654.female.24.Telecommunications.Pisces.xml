      Another busy day!  Ever wonder why your cable goes out or your phone cuts off..its the rain! I feel sorry for the guys I have to call and ask them to brave the elements so 4 people can watch T.V. but what can you do.

      This is my first blog so it should be interesting. I could never keep a diary so maybe this will be different. Today has been uneventful so far. It is raining all over the state with no relief in sight. I am at work watching the weather and handling the repercussions.  I was logged in on my yahoo messenger but my latest interest was nowhere to be found.  He is a sweet guy who makes me laugh and actually listens to what I say. I guess when you can't find the right guy in the USA, you have to find one that is just passing through!

      I don't know how many people have ever been to an Alamo Draft House, but they are the best damn movie theater out there!  I went and saw Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle with a friend and I have to say...that is the funniest movie I have seen in a while.  The Village was sold out so we went to see this movie instead.  I don't know if I would have paid to go see it if we had not been there already but man...I was rolling the entire movie!  The 3 Bud Lights I had didn't hurt either!  That's the point I was going to make about The Alamo Draft House, they serve real food at a semi-regular price.   It is 1:15 AM and I am soooo sleepy already.  I start working overnights in 2 days and I have no idea how I am going to stay up all night.  I am having a hard time sleeping during the day so I end up in bed by 3-4 in the morning (which isn't too bad).  Oh well, we shall see how it goes.

      I just need to say this: I love my new Apple Laptop!  It is small, cute, and it just takes a little bit to figure out this different operating system.   Well, my week is going pretty good so far.  Unfortunately, I will be starting the overnight shift next week so I will have no social life for 2 months! There really is not much to say about that.  All I will be doing is homework and watching DVDs (on my new Apple :).   The other thing going on is that I got off work so I can go play in a 3 person scramble in 2 weeks!  Thank goodness my finger healed quickly.  This tournament has a $90 entrance fee, but it is worth it to be playing in tournaments again.  There is another tournament at he end of August that I am trying to get off for.  We will see about that one. Lastly, I am still a little weirded out by this whole internet dating thing.  There is this guy that I chat with and he is just perfect.  There is nothing that I don't like about him.  He does not even smoke!  He is a little submissive which is probably for the best because the aggressive guys that I am used to dating never work out.  Its just the whole thought of meeting someone from off the net that just throws me for a loop.  I guess it is a lot like You've Got Mail though.  Oh well, after this next 2 months we shall see!

      I went and saw The Bourne Supremacy last night and I have to say it was pretty good.&nbsp; I went with 2 guy friends of mine and I have to say every time I go out with them, I feel like I have 2 bodyguards.&nbsp; It just makes me laugh :).&nbsp; Luckily, these 2 guys are computer savvy and I needed some help.&nbsp; I ended up staying up until 5:30 in the morning while he was working on my computer and getting some files transferred from my PC to my new laptop.&nbsp; Needless to say, this 13 hour shift that I am on now is already starting to kick my butt.&nbsp;   Other exciting news!&nbsp; My old high school golfing buddy invited me to play in a scramble with her and another guy.&nbsp; There is a $90 entrance fee, but with my drives and their short game I think we stand a good chance of making some money on the side.&nbsp; It is in a few weeks and I will definitely post the results.&nbsp;

      Funny story today.&nbsp; My hands are pretty soft except for 1 small callous on my pinky finger caused by gripping the club too hard.&nbsp; Anyways, I have a small garden that faces the street and it&nbsp;was getting a little unruly.&nbsp; I&nbsp;used some&nbsp;small clippers&nbsp;to trim and shape the bushes and by the end of the line, I could feel a small blister forming&nbsp;through my gloves.&nbsp; I cleaned up my mess and went inside for a break from the heat.&nbsp; When I took off the glove, I discovered I had rubbed the skin off my middle finger and some of my palm!&nbsp; I put some rubbing alcohol & a band-aid on it.&nbsp; I tried to go back out and work on part two which consisted of pulling the grass out from under the bushes but it was not a pleasant feeling.&nbsp; Okay, well that doesn't sound like a funny story when you re-read it, but I am laughing at myself.&nbsp; I guess I won't get to play golf this week after all!   Not much else going on.&nbsp; I got my new computer in yesterday and I have been busy loading my MP3 songs onto it so I can then upload it to my Ipod!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp; Now I know this is really girly girly but, I found a cute bright  pink  cover for my Ipod!&nbsp;  Pink  is just an all around great color :)&nbsp; That's all for now!

      I am not a morning person, but I do occasionally catch the Bobby Bones Morning Show on 96.7 KISS FM here in Austin.&nbsp; It is pretty funny like most good morning shows.&nbsp; I have also been inside the station playing a contest on Brotha Freds show in the afternoon.&nbsp; One thing I have learned about the management there (or Clearchannel in general) is they are very afraid of public opinion.&nbsp; Every little thing DJs do to attract an audience which puts money into "The Man's" pocket is met with a brick wall.&nbsp; If ratings go down,&nbsp;the DJs get blamed for the bad ratings and are eventually fired.&nbsp; What can a DJ do that draws a crowd but does not cause controversy?&nbsp; That is like asking which came first, the chicken or the egg!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyways, the reason why I am on this topic is because I heard a public announcement apologizing for a radio stint that might have offended someone.&nbsp; Bobby Bones has his own bloc describing what happened:  urlLink  http://www.bobbybones.blogspot.com/  &nbsp;.&nbsp; I actually think the whole situation is kind of funny other than the clerk who was probably scared out of his mind.&nbsp; Oh well, just thought I would go off for a second.&nbsp; Happy Posting!

      Well, I lied.  I broke down and got the computer that I liked aesthetically as well as for the hardware.  I went with an Apple Powerbook.  Now all I know is Windows so it will be interesting learning the differences. Luckily, they just opened an Apple store in the mall and they have hands-on classes there every day!  After a few weeks I should be pretty fluent in Mac. The really cool part is I got an 15MB IPod with it for only $70. Now I will finally have something to listen to when Usher or Los Lonely Boys come on...again and again.    School is about to start up again. I am going to attempt to fit 9 hours in this semester.  Since I go to overnights soon, I should have an abundance of spare time. I try to take most of my classes online so I don't have to worry about driving through traffic to get to school on time.  Plus I get to go at my own pace!  My little sister called me today saying she could not pay me the rent form June for another week because she is lacking the funds.  But she is going out of town to visit her friends for the next 2 days. I live with her in a less than desirable location because she is pretty new to Austin and does not have the maturity to be able to make it on her own. Plus I need to keep her out of trouble!  Maybe eventually she will learn that living paycheck to paycheck is not going to cut it. Until then, big sis to the rescue :)

      Who knew choosing a laptop could be so tedious!  I have been on-line comparing Dell, Gateway, HP, Toshiba, Sony..the list never ends. Do I need 40 or a 60MB Hard Drive? Should I go ahead and upgrade to 1 GB of RAM? What are those little USB Pen Memory things and could I use it on my school computer?  Will I use the wireless internet option? Which one is prettier, black or silver? I think I have decided on a Toshiba from Office Depot which is reasonably priced, easily upgradeable, and has a rebate!  I am debating on the warranty, but that just seems like a waste of money since half the guys I work with will probably be able to fix in for me!

      Today was pretty fun.  I went bowling with a few co-workers around lunch time.  The first game I think I bowled a 64 and the second was around 98. On the first game, everyone was giving me a hard time because they believe I am good at all sports because I kick ass in golf.  The first frame, I rolled a strike and they just couldn't believe it.  All I could do was turn around and smile.  When the gutter balls came, they thought I was faking.  After about 3 frames, one of the guys realized I was not faking and came to help me out!  In bowling, getting your wrist over is not a good thing...haha. Either way, it was fun....I lost :).   Work has been a little hectic but nothing I can't handle. This weekend is my 12 hour shift so I will either have a lot to say or nothing at all!

      Another day another dollar. Not much happened at work today.  I did listen to my best friend in Oklahoma tell me how stupid I am being for not meeting this guy I have been talking to!  Laura knows best!  Well, she has been with this guy Billy for over 2 years and she knows he is cheating on her but she refuses to leave him.  Why do women subject themselves to bad guys?  I settled once and now I have the title of Divorced!  At least I didn't have any kids with him.  Well, that is just a little bit of drama going on.  Not much else thank goodness. Well, time to get ready for bed :)

      Not much to report today.  I found out that I will be working the overnight shift at work for another co-worker while he gets additional training.  Overnights are nice because not a lot happens but I don't like them because it gets too slow and it is hard to stay awake the entire time.  Time to catch up on my reading I guess.  Of course I will probably just end up studying most of the time.  This also means no social life for me!  Sure I will have some weekends off, but establishing a steady sleeping pattern ruins that.    Other than that, not much going on.  I saw Spider Man 2 today and it is sooo good.  All I can say is it is about time! I am referring to the ending but I don't want to give it away :)

      What a weekend!  I spent a long weekend in Houston with some family members and I had a blast!  My favorite moments were the downtown fireworks, the Rangers finally beating the Astros, meeting Wynonna and Naomi Judd (yes...meeting and talking to them!), and hanging out with my 6 year old niece. She is honery and stubborn which is quite similar to what my parents say I was like as a child. That must be why we get along so well.  I also discovered Ikea.  At first I was okay in this 2 story complex of home decor heaven, but then all the nick nacks are on the 1st floor (which was the last place we looked).  Needless to say, I did some shopping and I have a whole new look in my bedroom to show for it!  Not much has been going on since then. I mowed the lawn and cleaned the house.

      Thank god the rain is gone!!  I was so happy I was singing and dancing in my car on the way to work. Don't you love seeing people just having a good old time in their car. Even though there is not much rain, it has been a busy day. I had 2 conference calls today where all we were trying to do is to prove to the other company that the problem was on their equipment. People just don't like hearing that sometimes.   I did get to chat with my guy....I might as well call him my "crush" because he has me acting all giddy. I love it when I meet someone who makes me smile!   Now for the dilemma, I met him on-line and he wants to meet in person.  That just seems a little scary because then it is real. Not that chatting on-line isn't, but it is easier to just relax.  Now first dates through probably the forth date are the getting to know you time and it is hard to be yourself because you are so worried about what the other person is thinking....or at least I do.  Oh well, maybe if I had dated someone who hadn't left out of the blue, come back, and leave again with no explaination other than he didn't want to involve me in some personal issues he was working out, I would be a lot less worried about dating. Did that make sense?

      Working nights takes a toll on your body.  It seems like I don't have the time to do the things that I want to do because it is too late or too dark to do them.  I can't wait for it to be over!!!  Well, the guy that I cancelled on for the golf tournament keeps calling my friend and asking her if anything has changed.  He calls her on average about 4 times a day.  If any guys are by chance reading this, let me offer a word of advice.  Don't get clingy too soon.  It is a big turn off in relationships as well as acquaintances.    On my way home from work a few days ago, a guy hit my car.  It was not a major accident but it was definitely upsetting.  He was in the right lane at a red light and I was pulling onto the paved shoulder to make a right turn.  I don't know if he was wanting to turn right the whole time or if he just changed his mind, but he turn once I got beside him and scratched the front  left side of my car above the wheel.  Now I get to wait for the insurance companies to battle it out.  I generally try to steer clear of drama because I can turn into a sobbing mess so I was amazed that I made it home before I started freaking out.  Of course the poor insurance guy I talked to probably felt bad for me...lol.  This is the 3rd incident I have had in this car since I got it a little over a year ago.  Something cracked my windshield while I was at the dentist and I got rear ended while a truck cut me off so he could go to Wal-Mart.  I do love living in Austin :)  Maybe I just need a new car....I wish.

      I had a great time at the tournament this weekend.  Although we did not win, we had fun.  It was a 3 person scramble out in BFE at a 9 hole course which was in pretty good shape.  I was playing with my best friend Crystal and her friend Jack.  We shot 67 both days. The winner or the tournament shot a 55 the first day so we were nowhere close.  Me and Crystal were the only 2 girls out there and the guys we played with were so careful not to curse around us.  If they only knew!  Most of the guys we played with had a little sense of humor but there were a couple who were just uptight...I guess because girls were beating them ...hehehe.    I was going to play in a guys and dolls tournament in 2 weeks with Jack, but honestly I did not enjoy playing with him all that much.  I like to have fun, but in golf there are certain rules of etiquette that all people should abide by.  I don't know him well enough to correct him and just playing with someone who cannot keep quiet while others are hitting bothers me.  I don't want to hurt his feelings so I lied and told him I had to work.  I don't like to lie but it is a small white lie that saves someone's feelings.  Plus I get to avoid awkwardness if I see him again.  Oh well, that's the latest!

      I have discovered the good thing about working overnights!  I am up in time to watch the sunrise.  This morning I sat outside for about 15 minutes just watching how beautiful it was.  I love how the light reflects off the clouds and creates this pink and orange glow.
