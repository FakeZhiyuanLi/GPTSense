      Oh man- so i went to the Warped Tour with Jess on Sunday at Raceway Park and it was such a barrel of monkeys. In addition to getting a bunch of free stuff: stickers, buttons, Slim Jims, posters, etc we also got a bunch of great music and tee shirts. We saw a bunch of bands, most of which were really great including: the Fear Nuttin Band, Matchbook Romance, the Casualties, Yellowcard, Taking Back Sunday, the Washington Social Club, Melee, the Kinision, Bad Religion, Motion City Soundtrack, and (drum role...) The Bouncing Souls! The Bouncing Souls kicked so much booty, i can't even tell you but the real find of the day was neeting Melee and the Washington Social Club. They both were super nice and provided great tunes. We even missed Melees's set and they did an acoustic one to satisfy our needs to hear them live. We also met the Q and the Kinision. All in all an uber successful day of spankin tunes, great friends, awesome merch and good times!

      Think back. Back in time. Back to a time when MTV wasn't ruled by Jessica Simpon's sister and the Real World was the only reality show on TV. Back to a time when there was quality television. And the underdog inspired many. That underdog was Daria Morgendorfer.  Do you remember Daria? That show of the trials and tribulations of teenage outcast with dark humor and dead-on high school stereotypes has always been one of my favorites and i wept when it was cancelled years ago.  But! On channel 100, the Noggin channel, (recently added for my viewing pleasure since Patriot Media has so graciosuly given my family digital cable) Daria is on at 11:30 PM and 2 AM- and on some nights- from 11-12 and 2-3 Yes, there is a higher power and yes i do appreciate whoever has given me my favorite show again.  So watch, embrace and feel the love that Daria can give each and every one of you.  "Sometimes your shallowness is so thorough, it's almost like depth"- from Daria  meehee

      So, back with a new look and a new name. Things still crazy and marvelous. Work is fun and friends are better- a fantastic time with Lemo, Jake and Case for Justin's b-day on the boat and the Warped Tour with Jess this Sunday- so fun! Getting fencing gear this Saturday and dinner with Case on Friday night before she leaves for camp for 2 weeks- *tear!* my cousin Jeff came for the weekend, which is always a blast because he always gives me some sortof inspiration to follow my artistic dreams (as he did and is uber successful in NYC) Been listening to Oasis alot lately. They are total Beetles rip-offs- but hey, its cool. Meep! Bouncing Souls in ***6*** days!
