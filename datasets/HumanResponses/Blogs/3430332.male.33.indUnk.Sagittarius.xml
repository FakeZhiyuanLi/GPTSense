      Ever since 1998 I have made some major changes in my life.  To make a long story short, I grew up.  A co-worker came in to tell me a story.  He son in law’s brother and wife had their baby this weekend.  The did the sonograms & saw that the baby was a girl.  So they planned everything.  From painting the room pink, to picking out the name, to making pillows with the babies name, heck the father even had a big tattoo put on his back with his daughters name on it.    The big day come this past weekend.  After hours of labor the baby came.  The father yelled “She isn’t suppose to have that thing” yes the baby was a boy.  Now this is where your sitting there thinking.  Wow that’s what you get for jumping the gun buddy!  The story does not end well though.  They think the cord was wrapped around the babies throat for too long.  Now the baby is showing signs of brain damage.  The baby does not want to be held, open his eyes, eat & does not react to be poked by a needle.    10 years ago I would have shrugged this story off.  But today I can’t but help be thankful I have the healthy boys I have today.

      After hearing this word "Blog" on Tech TV a billion times I decided to look into it.  Thus a came to this place & thought.  What a cool idea.  Something I could link to my site that gives me an open forum to speak my mind.    Of all the things to say on my first one it’s going to be King Kong.  Not 1933 classic.  Not the 1976 remake yet slightly different from the original.  No the December 14th 2005 version.  The good news – Peter Jackson is making this flick.  It’s been a life long dream of his.  After seeing Return of the King.  I’ve decided that this guy knows how to make flicks.  I love King Kong (both 1933 & 1976).  I remember watching them every Thanksgiving with my father.  The more good news is they are going to use the original characters of Ann Darrow, Jack Driscoll & Carl Denham.  Now for bad.  JACK BLACK!  What the hell is Jackson thinking?!?  This guy hasn’t done anything good except High Fidelity.  If anything kills this movie it’s him.  He may be popular now in 2004 but we are still over a year and a half away from the release.

      Why do people who leave their kids in the car only to find out their child has died due to their ignorance get away with it?  A guy went to college from 7 am to 1 pm.  When he went to the daycare to pick up his baby they told him the baby was never dropped off.  The man freaked out and when he got back to his car there was the baby.  Yes the baby had died due to extreme heat.  From what I heard depending on where you live a car in 80 degree weather can get up to 120 in about 20 minutes.    Nothing happened to the father.  He won't be charged with anything since he "suffered enough".  Am I just being insensitive?  If you say yes then look at it this way.  This is one of many stories that get buried in the paper.  The majority of these people that commit such an act get the same thing "Suffered enough".  Wonder how many of these "accidents" are intentional from a parent that just can't handle the burden of having a child.

      "Finally we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. Finally we will have our  revenge ." - Darth Maul  Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith  My personal feelings on the title...love it. I think it's going to really set the tone for the movie. It's obvious it's going to be a dark flick. Something the series needs to get Star Wars fans excited about.  I also think people will appreciate the other two prequels more now with the story complete.  Guess we will find out May 19th. Now if I can just get Kelley to go see it at midnight for our anniversary!!!  P.S.  Countdown to Celebration III in Indiana is on! Drew &amp; I will be there with my buddy Paul.

      Not the NFL though! Well not yet at least. My son Drew (9 years old) is having a go at football this year. The past several years he didn't want to play because he was afraid of getting hurt. But just like teaching him to ride his bike he had to be properly motivated. His best friend was gonna do it also. Even though they're in different leagues he still wanted to join.   Finally a sport that I actually enjoy watching.  Not that HIS baseball & soccer games are boring I'm talking about professional.   Training camp started on 08/02/04.  The kids that have played in the past have referred this week to "Hell Week" since it's about conditioning them.  So far after 2 days he's feeling good and excited about going back each day.  Although he sleeps forever now at night.  Something I have noticed about him.  He has some determination brewing in him for this sport.  Which is great because I think it will push him into the maturity that he needs for 4th grade.  It going to be fun to watch.  I'm going to take pictures of him at practice this Thurday or Friday.
