       rofl someone keeps callign me on a withheld number. my mobile of course. i pick up the phone "lo?" and i just hear breathing. XD its really funny cuz every now and again i hear someone talking or something weird shit. best one was at 2am the otehr night i was like "hey baaabeeee ;)" and they were silently confused and scared i guess. its probably jim because he loves all male contact. his favorite kind of love is the kind that exists between two naked men while he watches

       OMFG. that was so cool. i just went to the dentist for some lovely tooth removal yiiiis.  so right there i am getting drugs pumped into my guns to numb it right? but only the dentist, she uses too much. way too much. im sitting there and shes heaving away so hard shes lifting my head off the god damn chair thing. im sitting there "arent you gona start yet...." anyway after about 10 mins of pulling shes heaves the biggest bastard tooth i ever saw. blood allover the place. The dentist herself starts heaving i was like ^____^ then im walking through town with a totally numb tongue, gums, nose, throat, and half of my face. As you can imagine talking was very funny. "Mphhhwwblll" so im at home all drugged up wondering when ill finally get all the feeling back in my face atm :D.
