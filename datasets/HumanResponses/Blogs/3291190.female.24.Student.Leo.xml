      I am soooo pissed off. I owe so much fucking $$$ it isn't even funny. I get bills out the ass while rich ass kids get to do nothing all day long. I don't have any money & I am frustrated as hell. My frog died, my boyfriend owes me money, I have $50 to get me to & from the hotel in boston & to eat for 5 days...fuck! & I am fat....... I am not a happy camper....I feel like screaming. DAMN i am annoyed!

      Memphis in May this year, I listened to "All over you" by Live, in the rain with Evan. It was beginning to pour, & they started singing "Our love is like water, been down & abused for being strange". I just remember kissing him, & feeling the rain trickling down my face. It was such an awesome feeling. Like we were the only two people in the world.  Its funny because I spoke to my sister tonight, I think she is going to leave her husband. Hes a real ass, but from what I can gather, they have had some good times. So I begin to think, what if, forever isn't the whole point....what if its just holding on to bits & pieces of moments. That are pure but brief. Isn't that just as good? Why clutter up our lives with insincere talks & promises of a lifetime spent together, when you truly aren't with them right now?

      I am tired and I think I am sick. I'm sure I will be ok, but I just feel very confused about things. Its like when you look from the outside in. You begin to see the people who give a shit & those who don't. Sometimes it really hurts. I am very quick to say, thats it, we're done. Both with friends & with guys. Its so hard b/c I spend most of my time running around trying not to get to close to someone, or balancing shit out so I am not vulerable. But isn't that the whole point to life?? You would think that I enjoy shutting myself off from people & pulling away whenever someone has gotten too close. Its like, I can't handle REALLY being with someone, in the good times & the bad. I think b/c I'm afraid that no one will do that for me. & then of course the self pity follows, which is annoying as hell, even to me. A lot of times I just search & try to grasp the meaning to all of this shit. What is the fucking point? can someone tell me? all of these fights & debates about who is right & who is wrong...well who fucking cares? I don't. It just all seems so petty & pointless. Right now, I don't feel close to anyone & I don't want to. Its all just one big hassle. You expect for people to  care & they don't. Cry me a river. Its life & think that we are all destined to go through a large portion of it alone, but we will never be independent, we will always need others to help us along the way.  So lets get this shit out, so I can go back to sleep. I have been having girl problems, & I'm scared theres something wrong. I expressed this to evan & instead of checking on me (since I almost passed out today & don't have enough $ to go to the doctors) he borrowed some money from his friend, went out to eat sushi & watched a band. He said he'd check on me later. WEll, he didn't & I think to myself...for someone who professes their love for me so often you would think that they would atleast care enough to call. well, he doesn't & once again I am stupid for depending on people, or thinking they would give a shit. It hurts & I am sorry for caring. There it is. None of this tough bullshit. So, I am inclined to break it off. This is wasting my time, but there is nothing that I have more of. So, again, what is the point? I got my feelings hurt...wahh, I want to dump him b/c of it....thats childish....& now I am confident that I am really evolving & growing as a person..... So many of us are in the dark. I just want to shed some light on who I really am. I am angry & hurt but I don't want that to take control of me. Those emotions are ones that we all experience, they are apart of life. But if we dwell & wallow in them too long it becomes a waste & we miss the things & the people that are important in our lives. I am confused as what to do. I'm sure the answer will become more clear with time. I guess I just have to let it go. Other people have much larger problems, its funny b/c I can hardly see that b/c I am so wrapped up in my own.  Goodnight

      The sky is grey,  the sand is grey,  & the ocean is grey I feel right at home,  in this stunning monochrome, alone in my way, I smoke & I drink, & every time I blink, I have a tiny dream but as bad as I am, I'm proud of the fact that I'm worse than I seem.  you walk through my walls,  like a ghost on TV, you penetrate me. in my little pink heart,  is on its little brown raft, floating out to sea.  what can I say,  I'm wired this way & your wired to me. & what can I do, but wallow in you, unintentionally.

      Sometimes I wonder, why the hell can't I have a normal dad? Its like, hes a good person, he just has soooo many problems, sometimes I need him to help me with mine. Then I think, damn I am a huge ass cry baby. At least I have a dad, even if he is in rehab.

      SO, I am searching the web for some information on Attrition rates & research (trying to think of something else & pass time while I can't sleep) I type attrition & research into google & come up w/ this website http://www.cwasu.org/warattrition1.htm, isn't it ironic? can't seem to escape shit. guess certain things you have to face, b/c when you try to hide from them, they find you.

      So...with all of this bullshit, would it be the most freeing to be completely honest? Well, if that can free me from the shit that torments me then that would be wonderful. So lets be honest. Its often ugly, but its better than wrestling with it alone. I was raped & you think to yourself bo-fucking-ho. So many girls complain & cry about it & so did I. Believe me, I have spent more than my fair share of time crying, wondering why, going to counselor to "talk about it". The details are pointless. All that matters, is that for a while, I had my feeling of control, my sexuality & my pride taken away from me. So I became angry, a part of me still is. Its strange how you can be having sex & be somewhere else in your head. Anywhere but there, because apart of you is still scared, even though it happened years ago, these memories come flooding back, all at once. Afterwards sitting on the edge of the bed crying, telling him not to touch you. & trying to reassure him at the same time, that its ok, its not his fault, YOUR the one who is still fucked up, after all of these years. and I think to myself DAMN. How did this happen? How did I get here? Why can't I be close to anyone? Why do I feel so far away. Its like every time my parents would scream at me. I would go somewhere else in my head. A buffer zone, b/c there, they can't hurt you & they can't touch you. But the point to all of this is that I don't want this shit to define me. I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me. Worse shit happens everyday to a million different women. I just want to escape it. I can't watch movies like Gothika because they bring back fucked up memories. Its so hard b/c you want to be normal. To be able to watch these movies & then just turn it off. But instead it brings back associations that you buried long ago. I know I am going to have nightmares tonight. Sometimes I am really scared & I guess thats why I am so cold towards most men. Why I don't like for them to touch me, or hug me. Why I don't like to cuddle & I am distant. I refuse to let this shit define my life, but it sucks b/c every once in a while it comes back. You feel sick to your stomach & suddenly you are reliving the moments you always wanted to forget. I just don't want to relive this shit on my own, at times I want to reach out & talk to someone about it, so I could relieve some of the stress...but where do you start? It happened years ago, its over with, but just not for me.

      I just finished watching Gothika, I can't sleep. It brought back some fucked up memories. Its scary, some of the things that we experience. I will always be alone with those memories. I know what it feels like to be on the other side. To have shit taken away from you & to see things that are fucked up happening. Its like you are so powerless. I should have known not to watch that movie. I should have known that it would have disturbed me. I lay there & tried to talk to Evan about it, but he started to fall asleep. In that moment I felt more alone than I ever have. Its strange how you can lay next to someone & feel like you are a million miles away.

      I enjoy the blur of spectacular moments we spend together like the pages to your favorite book, i wish we would go on forever last night, as we drove slowly along the dark country side I felt the wind on my face, laying back I thanked you for the ride watching the lightning bugs sparkle & dance amongst the trees I listened to the sound of your voice & the wind blowing through  leaves and I think to myself I will never find a moment more care free longing to capture it, holding the thought close to illuminate me but we all have to let go of the old & embrace the new I never understood that to achieve this,I'd have to let go of you. I love it here, but we have to return to reality, I know its going to be tough. We are in never-never land & Peter, its time for us to grow up.

      So...Evan cooked last night, we watched tv & his friend Gannon came over. Evan invited me to eat dinner with his parrents tomorrow night, which made me feel a little excited and scared.  At one point, after discovering that I have no $$$ he offered to give me money for gas. Its a horrible thing but secretly deep down inside I do enjoy it when someone cares enough to go out of their way to take care of me.  We then proceeded to have an awesome night with many unplanned occurances and a couple firsts for me. It seems as though the moments alone with Evan are really starting to get to me. Its the simplest thing like explaining my day to him, or just sitting beside him & reading while he watches TV. Something strange fills those moments that creates an attachement or a bond. Those quiet moments spent side by side, day after day, lead me to the same place, & the same feeling of comfort.Its strange & scary but I really do care for this boy. So when I fall, its going to be flat on my face, feeling sick, depressed, the whole 9yards...but for now I am soaring up in the air. See you when I come back down

      Sooo, this is why I love summer. I get home, get out of the heat and into my air conditioned apartment. I can take a nap, watch TV, do whatever I want. Instead of stressing over some stupid paper or worrying about statistics. Thank God for summer, I think it keeps grad students sane.    As for the girl who died, she had an eating disorder....which is really sad. I can't believe the way some people go. Its completely unnecessary, being thin, being rich, any of the above is not worth your life. Its scary how dangerous & destructive our perspective can be to our own livelihood. Sometimes we are our own worst enemies.    I am getting ready to go on a run, the sun is setting & its beinning to cool off.  Evan is getting ready to come over & cook dinner, then we are going to watch TV or a movie. I think its wonderful to enjoy time with other people. Its like we spend almost all of our time with other people because we have to (work, school, etc.) its just nice to do it because we want to, or we enjoy their company. yada, yada, yada....oh, did i mention i have a headache? must not be drinking enough water....hmmmm...how much do you REALLY have to drink?!?

I really don't want to do shit but enjoy my summer & I start thinking crazy ass shit like, "why should I have to work?" why the hell not? i know i have to make money but fuck it.     So, I looked on bonnarro's website today & I became SOOO excited about their line up....i can't wait to go! heres a side note, my back hurts & I want to scream! but at least i woke up this morning. how quickly we forget :(

      So I feel lost, and I close my eyes Is life with you just one big compromise? Peering out into the world, but out my window is just an empty street Listening to my own soundtrack, one monotonous step after another, watching my feet I pad down this lonesome road, and inside my head I think about my future, confused and full of dread Do you think my life will sparkle or give me wings to fly? Or will I stand behind some dirty counter, watching the minutes drag by Filling my day with monotonous tasks,  And jumping whenever someone barks orders, doing whatever they ask Will I wonder where my dreams went? And wonder how my passion slipped away? Drifting back….living off happy memories of yesterday There is a conventional life waiting for me, with plenty of responsible things do I refuse to live life bye the rules just to appease you Follow me & Slip into my dreams… Come with me to experience the most bizarre things I sit alone; squeeze my eyes shut, and dance to a silent song Pace my room, running circles around ideas, painting all day long Suddenly I begin to laugh as I ponder what will become of me Tracing circles around a photograph of where I used to be

      I close my eyes, content w/ the snapshot of the world I have captured. Confident that I have discovered the truth that everyone is after. I can trace the lines that define the world w/ my very own finger. Graciously I delve out advice, causing this feeling of self-importance to linger.  In the blink of my very own omnificent eye I watch the picture change. I am horrified to see my truths & lessons in life rearrange. Quickly I must scramble to recover my dignity & reconstruct the truth. For I am the gatekeeper of knowledge, therefore I must rule the roost. I will provide you with all the opinions you could ever need. Within my constrictive definitions I will limit you to what you will believe. For one moment, if I could see beyond my own concept of self. Maybe I too would know the joy of listening to someone else. But my opinions & ideas are far too important not to relay. I am so engrossed in my own word; I never noticed you walked away. In this moment, picture in hand, I feel certain of why we are here. But wait, I forgot, I am only human & this is all a facade I created out of fear.

      Dancing inside my world, you slip beneath my skin. Ever aware of your presence, ever mindful of where we begin. Lost in a moment, one to beautiful to control. So I enjoy every second, even those my mind stole. I have lost the pieces to the future, but I am content here & now. Unknowing & unafraid, unaware of when or how. I became overcome with the desire to have you by my side. I realize I don’t want you to leave, showing emotion I usually hide. I lay down beside you tonight, fearful and unsure. Listening to the rhythm of your breath, living in a moment that is pure. With nothing to fall back on but an impermanent memory that is true.  I would loose myself there for eternity if that meant spending it with you.

      I got an e-mail today, telling me that a girl I know died in her sleep last night. She was only 19. It makes me wonder, what the hell am I doing with my life? And why didn't she get to finish hers? My mom said that maybe she finished what she was destined to do here. Is that true? If so, when will I be done & will I be ready when its time for me to go? It just makes me want to throw away all of the material possessions, stop wasting my life in the pursuit of money and actually acknowledge, listening to the person beside me. Maybe thats how we are supposed to live our life.

      Its funny, b/c before I started working in the hot steel mill (w/o AC) I don't think I ever fully appreciated how wonderful a breeze feels. Or the joy of cold water, or just getting to sit down for a second. I guess heavy, steel toed boots, miles of concrete & hours on your feet will do that to you. Its strange to watch when the lunch whistle blows....Suddenly it seems like all over the plant there is a sigh of relief & you watch as the men take off their hard hats & goggles, sit down & begin to dig into their cooler. Or to watch as about a dozen grown men crowd around a portable lunch stand that they set up every day at noon, like kids around an ice cream truck.   Another great joy is to be out on the shop floor when the shift whistle blows. You watch as the day shift guys practically run out of the shop & watch the new guys slowly venture over to man their work stations. Its almost as though these daily cycles remind one to enjoy their freedom & the moments that they truly own.  Often when I come home I am too tired to do anything but sleep. Its only now that I am beginning to get used to the cycle & actually do stuff after work.    I watch these men as they work, some I find are more educated than others. Some are more inviting & some are wary of my presence. You see, I stop and ask these guys about their jobs.  They stand there and explain it to me, each in their own way. Sometimes they ask me more questions than I get to ask them. The bottom line is I am there to figure out when & where things go wrong & who is responsible. Mostly to fix the problems & train the men. Unfortunately, the information that I rely to the higher up is not always used in constructive ways.  Often, it results in a misplaced reprimand....when the bosses are usually the ones who are to blame because they haven't taken the time to thoroughly explain what is expected of the worker.  It was very hard today when I was talking to a guy in shipping, he explained to me that most people are afraid to talk, because this is their livelihood and they have a family to take care of. That is something that I respect and I don't want to endanger that. But the truth is that I still have to be there and do my job and all that I can do is appreciate the time spent & try to make it a better place.

      my intense story continued...jeezz, I should take this & write a soap opera. My dad is still in the hospital. He is going crazy b/c of the morphine, he told my mom that he can smell the mold behind the wall paper in the hospital room..???? don't ask me...he also doesn't like the sound of the phone ringing...so I haven't talked to him since it happened. Mom doesn't want to answer the phone b/c she is tired...GREAT.  As for my sister, she is out of the hospital but keeps going back b/c she has some type of infection or something in addition to kidney stones...yada, yada, yada. As for Rob, he has moved on & is continuing his trek across country. Evan...I bailed him out (which was a feat in it's self). Dealing w/ the bond guys (who are shady as hell). We chilled out for a day or so & then went to get his car from the impound lot. His car was dead, the windows were down, we had to TYE his battery on with a ROPE!!! & if that wasn't bad enough it began to thunderstorm while we were trying to find someone to jump his car. Oh yeah...did I mention he doesn't have reverse? So I fell while trying to push his car backwards. Jeezz. at any rate I looked like a drowned rat & I think my cold got worse b/c of the whole ordeal. Oh well, @ least he wasn't hurt. Its been a strange couple of days. I am glad it has finally calmed down... I started my job today @ a steel factory. That was fun (not really) I have to wear huge protective eye goggles, ear plugs, hard hat & steel toed boots....there are 180 men in the factory & only 2 women....(including me). Its going to be an experience!

      These past couple of days have been very strange. First, my friend Rob came to visit me, (he is moving to Cali & is crashing for a couple of days). Sooo...Rob, Evan & I went to watch some music at Newby's. Around midnight we all went & crashed back @ Evan's place. The next morning I woke up to knocking on Evan's wall. His neighbor was yelling "call your sister!!!" This really confused me b/c he doesn't know my sister. So I went out to find Rob (he was sleeping on the couch) only, he wasn't there anymore, & neither was my phone???????? what the hell! So I went over to the neighbors house, & he told me that I needed to call my sister right away b/c my Dad was in the hospital (he has blood clots, diabetes, high BP, etc.) I freaked out...went back to my apartment & found Rob asleep on my steps....w/ my phone. He had wandered off in the night, & eventually found his way back to my apt.  Soooo, I am waiting on my dad to come out of surgery to find out if I need to go home. Finally I decided that I should just go home. I call my sister to let her know what I am doing & she tells me that SHE is on her way to the hospital!!!! she is passing kidney stones.....SHIT! So i decided to stay here & make sure that she was ok. At this point I have started to get sick with a cold that Rob & stress has given me. (***I do have to pause to say that I am fortunate in all of this b/c I am not the one suffering in the hospital****) So last night, Rob, Evan & I are all cooking dinner. I am still worn out from my cold & decide to stay here. While Rob & Evan go out to watch a Jazz band play. I am woken up @ 8am this morning, Rob knocking on my door. He told me he lost Evan last night, slept on a park bench & then walked 7 miles back to my place! I was furious! I couldn't believe that Evan didn't watch out for him. Well...around 10am I get a phone call from Evan....hes in jail.....

      Doesn't anyone find it funny that some of those people who deny being judgmental, often are the most? I have many people that I encounter everyday & everyone has an opinion. Which is great, more power to them. Its just funny b/c you can pick those who are in their "trendy" stage out. Those who will eventually grow up & become just what they hate. Just like a preachers daughter who rebels & becomes something wild, fun, crazy & free. She eventually circles back around & becomes what she was supposed to be. I think its ironic & I just wish I could be there to see when she puts on her first high water pants, keds, & mom sweater. Its nice to watch people become what they condemn...BECAUSE lets face it, everyone is soooo transparent, you condemn those things that hit too close to home, maybe those traits, those ones you love to hate are merely just reflections of you. take a look once in a while, try evaluating yourself & passing judgment on the things you do...ahh but its much easier to look outside of self & criticize everyone else.....

      Lisa kept a journal @ bonnaroo, here is what she wrote me :)  6-12-04 bonnaroo  Sara and Evan finally made it,  I was waiting for the pleasure of independence that best freinds bring we speak in a language that not many can understand a language than can communicae without words and a familiarity that makes any situation or experience seem like home you can be in japan, rome, or brazil and without that familiarity the ground seems to dissappear and colors aren't as bright But when you find someone who weaves loose strings together you are as tightly woven as an ancient quilt that continues to possess all the colors in the world and those colors are bright,  objects seem seem firmer the ground is solid and the path is clear that is what our friendship brings that is the feeling we get everytime we connect again

      Bonnarro...the last day there were some CRAZY thunderstorms...Pouring rain, I remember standing underneath the tent w/ Evan. It was beginning to storm...& lightning was striking the all around the stage. Everything seemed so surreal. The sky was bright yellow, leaving everyone (especially those tripping) in awe. I think that was one of my most favorite moments at bonnaroo. A little snapshot that I have taken with me. -After the rain ended, Phish came on & we ended up leaving early. It was crazy b/c mud was EVERYWHERE...I fell a couple of times & Evan got to laugh his ass off at me. I was also extremely high. I think I smoked more that day than I have ever in my life.... -seriously!!! So, we walked back to our car (3miles away) my feet/ankles/legs had swollen up so bad that I could barely walk. then we proceeded to drive home b/c I had a job interview & a meeting w/ the head of the dept. the next day. However, about 2hrs into the drive I realized that I should not have been driving. So I pulled over & we slept in a parking lot. Evan woke up @ 5am  & didn't know where the hell we were :) all in all it was one awesome time :) and a very fun trip ;)

      This will be the first blog about Bonnaroo, since there is soooo much to say!  I will start from the beginning. Evan & I drove for 4 hours, then spent 8hrs waiting in line to get in to the camp site. Around 4pm we were stuck on a bridge & we saw all of these guys running & screaming. Apparently one of their friends had to use the bathroom & stepped off the bridge (which appeared to be 5ft off the ground) -to him...but he was on something that was fucking up his perceptions b/c he ended up jumping off a 25ft bridge! w/ only an inch of water & jagged rocks...????? I got out of the car, people were pointing their flash lights at him. He was laying there, & looked like a chalk outline, there was a dark ring of blood around his neck....I don't think he died...but still that shit was scary!

      the blood & a shard from the glass you broke still remains on the floor. I tie back my hair into a pony tail, tossing you & the memory out the door. this night, I am all that there is. I find my greatest joy in this emptiness. I run out the door to discover another world outside. my secret smile, my anger & opinions I no longer hide. this world is mine, alive, fresh & brand new. I found myself again, but to do this, first I had to lose you.

      I am left here to linger in these manic emotions. Watching you try to light your cigarette as I question your devotion. holding on as my rage takes me for a ride. I am propelled forward, I am no longer in control & I can't hide. you wait, silently, until my patience is found. Quietly watching & waiting until I come back around. how long will it be until I can finally feel regret? wishing that you & this moment were something I could forget. I am distracted by a place where I can escape my own head where I can look away from you, & erase all the things you said. It beckons me, to chase after, enticing me to stay. but everything looses its luster & I would never be content anyway. I wish to be surround by wild flowers, the sea & the moon. But most of all God, sometimes I just want to go home. So often I sit alone & watch these moments slip by, nothing really matters to me anymore, & again I start to cry. my eyes & senses could never fully appreciate the beauty that surrounds me. If I could just let go of all of these vices & fears, I might just be free. But freedom is not something you can really loose, or find. Its something that is always with us, it resides inside of our mind.

      Your gaze burns my eyes like the sun and I am forced to look away. My words etched with fire, disintegrating, until there is nothing left to say. I built my house of glass & damned you out of fear & mistrust. That you, a mirror image, reflecting my own betrayals and lust. The Indian ink, by which I branded you, solidified your existence. Through fear I denied you, painting a portrait of ignorance. I have become a mere entity, trapped in the creation of my own game. A disjointed puzzle piece, moved by emotions, constantly rearranged. Your hollow words linger, infiltrating my lungs, until I choke on your lies. My smile reflects your insincerity because I don't trust you enough to cry. I am discouraged by my failure to elude those ominous premonitions. That our time together merely succeeded in fulfilling stereotypical definitions. You were reaching out for anyone and somehow stumbled upon me. I was too enchanted with the idea, to needy & naive. Although we never discovered forever, its promises still left us blind. My hear tangled in the memories of yesterday, forcing me to leave it behind. I felt a chill embrace my body, my lips remained too frozen to confess. That although you never really knew me, I loved you none the less.

      i spend a lot of time wondering about the point...I mean, what is the fucking point to all of this? I feel like a rat running around in a maze, just trying to get some cheese. So I talk all this bullshit about letting go, of people, friends etc. when its time to let go. but not really, the truth is that I am attached to certain people & I get sad when I realize that they have to leave. Instead of appreciating the times & the moments that we had.  I think I am going to go on a run. I feel sick to my stomach. Its like when you know that shit is over. You want to do anything to avoid looking it right in the eyes. Try to distract yourself, attend to the things around you. Just so you don't have to be consumed by that sickness.  Its so funny b/c I smile & stand there, like this shit isn't happening. Just waiting for this moment to pass. So I can go hide, my heart & my emotions. Wait until its all gone.

      There are places that we are supposed to be I can feel it, as it beckons me a swirl of coincidences, with no logic to be found all leading us down a particular path, circling round until i find myself in this one very moment, right next to you my friend, or a stranger, it makes no difference to a fortunate few

      I have been exhausted ever since the trip to boston. I have had a lot of things to think about & evaluate. I feel like everything that happened there was like one big dream. First off it was an extreme whether change for me, like suddendly I had woken up & it was spring again. Instead of being in the midst of one hot ass humid summer in Memphis, Tn.  Second, I was informed of a presentation that I was supposed to give @ 9 am the next day. I had nothing prepared...I was crazy nervous...hows that for a bad dream?  Enough of the boring shit. So I have learned so much in Boston, a lot about myself & a lot about my friends. For a while in Grad school I have really been doubting myself. Wondering if I truly belonged. The ABA conference gave me clarity. Suddenly I began to see my friends & mentors for what & who they really were, just people. I guess once I let everyone get down from their pedestal, I also got down from mine. It was a little less scary & I began to realize that no one REALLY has it all together. Everyone gets nervous & doubts themselves. I was walking around a poster session & suddenly it hit me. These people aren't smart, they're just people dressed up in suits trying to impress themselves & others. THats ok, as long as they are still trying to teach & don't get overly wrapped up in their ego. I got into a fight w/ chantey the first night we were there & it was extremely liberating. She said some really messed up things to & about me "you don't care about your school work or the type of grades you get". I asked her, why do you CARE???? & then I began to realize, who gives a fuck? Is this what I am really worth? To her it might be. She is just a miserable person who can't find a moments rest. Who feels compelled to hurt people because she is hurting. I forgive her for that & I forgive myself for hating her at the same time. Another moment of realization. Earlier in the year I was cruel to another girl b/c I felt as though she had come & taken my place in the lab. I felt threatened by her, as though people would start forgetting about me. After talking to her (she was extremely drunk & upset) I realized how much I had hurt her. I started to see myself from the outside & realize that my actions do have an impact on others, I saw myself from a new perspective & I didn't like it. I don't want to be driven by my insecurities.  So I have taken away a couple of morals from this trip: (isn't that the point of life?) 1. Your way of life, dreams & ideas are important but they should never be exclusive of, overshadow or supersede anyone else or their dreams. 2. Friendship comes from unexpected places, you can find joy in your moments of terror. 3. Perspective is everything, two people can witness the same moment or event & come away with two totally different experiences. 4. My life & who I am/ or will be is entirely up to me.

      I have been struggling with some things for quite some time now. It isn't until right now that I can finally write about them.  The first is a situation with my best friend. It has confused me to a great extent. Basically, I am fighting with myself. Do I handle things the old way? Where I push people away & become angry, or do I look at the situation despite the fact that it causes me pain and work through it. I guess everyday we have a choice of acting in accordance with who we want to be.  It is so easy to be who you were.  But I guess as the years pass and hopefully I mature, I can come a couple steps closer to acting in a way that is consistent with who I have hoped to become.  I don't want to be resentful, angry & judgmental, so why does that seem to be our human nature? Our default? Automatically pushing things, people, & situations away out of our gaze when they become painful.  Maybe to protect ourselves. I want to transcend these feelings, so they don't prevent me from enjoying the experiences that we are blessed with everyday.  It is so easy to become consumed with your own thoughts and feelings. Another struggle has been essentially living with my boyfriend.  I take him to court, & work almost everyday.  We share expenses (although I feel as though I pay for more than my fair share).  These are the trivial petty things that fill my days lately. We struggle with when to go to bed, whether he smokes in the house, if is friends are coming over, if we should go out & party. When really it is our life style differences & life goals that are pulling us in two different directions.  I become resentful when I feel like I am doing too much for him. I begin to think, where is my fucking ring?!? Even though I don't want one from him. Then I begin to feel like his mother! Which leads to thoughts of breaking up with him. (like when I had to take him to work at 5 am & he never said thank you, or offered gas money for driving him around for 2 weeks).  Then I think, I am being selfish, people do this for their children & family everyday. I asked him last night if he would do the same thing for me. He said yes. Then I began to wonder, what the fuck am I doing? Then it hit me......This is yet another example of me avoiding conflict, avoiding potential painful situations.  If I am upset, I need to speak up, saying what I mean & asking for what I need. Instead of becoming upset that he hasn't offered gas money, I should ask for it.  Now I am not saying that I am going to let or accept people running over me. I should accept the fact that people are going to disappoint me from time to time and that I can't complain about not receiving things I never asked for in the first place.  Life & situations are never perfect.    They are never what we had hoped for or what we had in mind.  Therefore, we have to work with what we have, try to be who we want to be and be upfront & honest about the things we want.   There are many wonderful things that Evan brings to my life, much like many of my friends.  Sometimes it is difficult to see clearly when close up is the only perspective you have to view the situation.  I guess I am just trying to deal with life & enjoy it at the same time.  Life is too short to be angry or constantly proving that you are right.  Besides, who cares, none of it matters in the end. Trying to live in the moment and still logically manage your life are difficult.  Its easy to read about it, but difficult to practice.  Evan brings the wonderful gift of living in the moment to my life.  Some may call it hedonistic, I don't really care. It is helpful in letting go of the vices that consume me & half of America.  It helps to distract me from my set way of life, breaks my routine, makes me feel uncomfortable and ultimately helps me to live a little more spontaneously.  Its like a roller coaster, a part of you is wondering why the fuck you even got on this ride, the other half is screaming with terror & sheer joy that the adventure brings.  Looking back at the ride, you feel speechless, and a smile covers your face.  I am tired of routine, I enjoy looking at things around me with a fresh perspective, as though for the first time.  So I am annoyed with the hassles that these relationships bring to my life, but forever thankful for the wonderful experiences they have given me. Ultimately, I am enjoying the ride, closing my eyes and throwing the rest to the side.
