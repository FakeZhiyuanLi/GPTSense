       Toledo Blade Rose Russell   TERESA Heinz Kerry sure has something to say. And I doubt if the media, the public, family, friends, and foes ever wonder what it is she really means. "By now I hope it should come as no surprise that I have something to say," she told the Democratic National Convention Tuesday night.  That she does certainly is no shock after she dissed a newspaperman, telling him early in the week to "shove it."  By most standards, such talk isn't what the public expects from the spouse of a candidate whose eyes are set on occupying the White House.  But no American citizen probably ever thought that the vice president of the United States would ever use "a really bad word" - as Ilana Wexler, the 12-year-old from California who addressed the convention, described Vice President Dick Cheney's comment - on the Senate floor. And I won't bring up the time then-presidential candidate George W. Bush hung a "bad word" on another journalist.  Ms. Kerry's straightforward comment was mild by comparison, but still it created quite a commotion. Apparently, observers long familiar with the interesting wife of Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Sen. John Kerry, are well acquainted with her frankness. The rest of us just getting to know her find her invigorating.  Nearly 90 years since the first woman was elected to Congress, 84 years after women obtained the right to vote, and three decades after women joined the workforce in large numbers, the public still expects the spouses of presidents and presidential candidates to act as bobble heads.  Kind of reminds me of a time when children were expected to be seen and not heard.  Well, dig up, those days are gone. The usual traditional role of the first lady began to quickly slip away in more recent years when New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had the job. As the most astute and best known woman in American politics, Senator Clinton was the first first lady to win a seat in the U.S. Senate while her husband was still president.  Now, if Senator Kerry wins the election, Ms. Kerry will shatter more of the view that first ladies in recent decades are mostly mum, coy, and passive.  And so what is expected of the first lady at the still-dawning 21st century? It's up to her, really. Whenever this country gets around to electing a woman for president, if she's married, I doubt her husband will remain quiet, unexpressive, and in the background.  If the wives of presidents and candidates for president want to be demure, fine. But don't expect too many repeats of Jackie Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, or Rosalynn Carter. Perhaps Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush were assertive, even if not in the public eye.  And while no insult is intended, whether or not Laura Bush likes it, she really is a picture of a 1950s wife in white America. Nothing wrong with that, if that's her preference.  But that's not Ms. Kerry's style. Her varied experiences make that impossible. She's Portuguese, born in Mozambique, educated in South Africa and Switzerland, and she speaks five languages. As a naturalized citizen whose native land was a dictatorship, she appreciates American liberties far more than some Americans want American-born women to.  "I have a very personal feeling about how special America is. My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called 'opinionated' is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish," she said Tuesday.  She looks forward to women not being labeled "opinionated" when they have something to say, and to a time when vocal women are also considered "smart and well informed just like men."  It's been said this week, but I repeat: Teresa, you go girl.

       AP Paul Nowell   First lady Laura Bush campaigned Friday for U.S. Senate candidate Richard Burr, telling supporters that her husband needs him to remain in Congress to push the administration's agenda. "When you leave here today, I ask you to redouble your efforts to help elect Richard Burr to the Senate," she told about 300 people at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser at UNC-Wilmington.  "We have about three months left before this election," Bush told supporters. "Every vote we can get for Richard Burr means a better and stronger America. He's someone who represents your hopes and dreams."  Burr, a five-term congressman from Winston-Salem, will face former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles in the November election. The winner will replace Democratic U.S. Sen. John Edwards, the party's vice presidential nominee.   Besides Burr, Bush also was greeted by Virginia Sen. George Allen and GOP gubernatorial candidate Patrick Ballantine.  Burr said it was no coincidence that the first lady came to North Carolina. "This Senate race has been designated as the No. 1 race in the country," he said.  Speaking in North Carolina the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in Boston, Laura Bush made it clear that President Bush was ready to pull out the stops to make sure a Republican wins the seat.  "She's a real contrast to the flap created by Teresa Heinz Kerry's recent remarks," said Rick Graves of Wilmington, who attended the fund-raiser with his wife, Becky.  "I could never imagine Laura Bush ever telling a reporter or anyone to shove it," said Becky Graves. "She's a real lady and a good mother and wife."  Jennie Poston, chairwoman of the College Republicans, said the first lady's visit was more than simply a fund-raiser.  "Her presence reinforces the support this state has for the Republican ticket," she said. "And for everyone who's fed up with Clinton and Kerry."  Laura Bush urged supporters to work for her husband's re-election, saying he has shown strong leadership in the war against terrorism and in working to create jobs for unemployed Americans.  The president should get more credit than he does for improving economic conditions, she said.

       Palm Beach Post George McEvoy   There is something about a transcontinental woman, something mysteriously attractive, and Teresa Heinz Kerry has it in abundance.  She is Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo all in one. She is Lili Marlene underneath the lamplight, by the barrack gate.  Oh, let's face it. I've got a thing for John Kerry's wife.  At the Democratic convention this week in Boston, she spoke of Sen. Kerry's many combat decorations from the Vietnam War — three Purple Hearts among them:  "John is a fighter," she said. "He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country. No one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will, and he will always be first in the line of fire."  She paused a moment and went on: "But he also knows the importance of getting it right. For him, the names of too many friends inscribed in the cold stone of the Vietnam Memorial testify to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength... "  Besides his charming wife, Sen. Kerry had his praises sung by experts this week. Former Vice President Al Gore opened things up with the best speech he ever gave. If he had spoken like that during his campaign for the presidency, George W. Bush by now would be a trivia question on Jeopardy!   (  urlLink ...  )   Democrats interviewed on TV needn't have fretted about whether Sen. Kerry would make a good acceptance speech. Surrounded by men he served with in Vietnam, Sen. Kerry delivered a rouser that kept the crowd on its feet. He outlined his plans for revitalizing the economy, for creating jobs and easing the unemployment problem. He talked about making higher education available to more young people, and vowed that he would not privatize Social Security, as President Bush has threatened to do.  He got loud cheers when he said that as president, he would appoint an attorney general who has respect for the Constitution, an obvious dig at John Ashcroft. But he kept an optimistic note throughout, saying at one point — "The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom."  And sitting in a box watching him, dressed all in white and smiling a Mona Lisa smile, was Teresa. I would have voted for Sen. Kerry anyway, but Teresa makes it a sure thing.

       East Valley Tribune Mary K. Reinhart   The rules have always been different for boys. In sports, in the workplace and, most glaringly, in politics.    Say what you will about the women’s movement and our ascendancy through a few glass ceilings, but at the end of the day we are still paid 76 cents for every dollar a man makes and not one of us has ever become president of the United States. And no matter how lofty a woman’s perch, there remains a preoccupation with the style of her hair and the cut of her clothing.   So it should come as no surprise that in this election season — with the everlooming threat of terrorism, soldiers and civilians falling to suicide bombers and ambushes in Iraq, the economy in fits and starts, a growing federal deficit and rising health care costs — we are treated to a seemingly endless array of snarky stories about Teresa Heinz Kerry.   "Teresa Heinz Kerry Speaks Her Mind." "Teresa Heinz Kerry: Her Own Woman." "Heinz Kerry Might Need a Makeover."   She’s rich, she’s interesting, she’s got her own job and — heaven forbid! — she’s outspoken. Naturally, she should be pilloried and picked over by pundits and political writers who have forgotten that it’s their job to clarify the candidates’ stands on the issues, not dig up details about how many SUVs their wives own.   Here in Arizona, where we elect women to hold our highest offices, we almost forget to ask what their husbands do for a living, much less give a whit whether they dye their hair.   We hold the wives of candidates, however, to a different standard, particularly if they dare to open their mouths and form an opinion. This despite the fact that they are typically mothers who have the unenviable job of trying to give their children normal lives while steeling themselves against criticism of their spouses. They never chose this life, but agreed to it out of love and devotion.   For all the people who loved to hate Hillary Rodham Clinton during her husband’s presidency, she still won election to the U.S. Senate from New York and has a brilliant political future. That’s because of who she is, and in spite of the many, many people who sought to take it away from her.   Those same people would like to use Teresa Heinz Kerry to bring down her husband. To cast a spotlight on her so blinding that it washes over the Democratic presidential nominee and ultimately extinguishes his bid to hold the country’s highest office.   Her words this week at the Democratic National Convention remind us why girls and boys deserve to play by the same rules:   "This evening, I want to acknowledge and honor the women of this world, whose wise voices for much too long have been excluded and discounted. It is time for the world to hear women’s voices — in full and at last."   You go, girl.

       San Angelo Standard Times Joan Lowy        Democratic activist Peggy Toomey Hammann wasn't sure what to expect when she agreed last January to a request that she take Teresa Heinz Kerry to meet with Navajo nation leaders during a campaign swing through Northern Arizona.  Certainly she didn't expect what she got - a presidential candidate's wife who could speak to Navajos with great sophistication, knowledge and sincere sympathy about the problems they face, including access to potable water, mining pollution and health care.  "These are very complicated issues and she spoke about them with ease," said Hammann, who lives in Page, Ariz. "Her knowledge of native people as well as Native American issues was astounding. There are a lot of Arizona politicians who can't do that ... Navajo issues are dear to my heart. I just loved her after that!"  Heinz Kerry's knowledge of Navajos is due in part to a Navajo roommate she had while living in Switzerland and a niece who worked for a time at a Navajo health facility, Hammann said.  Navajos are just one of many groups of voters that Heinz Kerry has been able to personally connect with. Perhaps more than any other would-be first lady, Maria Teresa Thierstein Simoes-Ferreira Heinz Kerry is truly a woman of the world. Her varied background, spanning three continents, has provided her with a rich multicultural heritage.  Born in Mozambique to Portuguese parents, Heinz Kerry has been known at times to refer to herself as an "African-American." Campaigning for her husband, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, during the Democratic presidential primaries, she spoke comfortably in French with New Hampshire shopkeepers who had emigrated from Quebec.  If her husband wins the election, Heinz Kerry - who speaks five languages fluently, including Spanish - will become the nation's first Hispanic first lady, Hispanic delegates at the Democratic National Convention said.  "Because she is an immigrant and will be the first Hispanic woman to be first lady of this country, she will have a better understanding of our community," said delegate Mary Alice Cisneros, the wife of former San Antonio, Texas, mayor and Clinton Cabinet official Henry Cisneros.  Heinz Kerry, 65, frequently draws on her background as an immigrant to the United States to connect with voters, whether they are of Hispanic or Asian or European descent.  In San Antonio, Heinz Kerry told women voters that she "suffers the same pains as Cubans who have family still living in Cuba, but have not been able to return there," Mrs. Cisneros said. Heinz Kerry's family left Mozambique for Switzerland after Portuguese rule was overturned.  Yet, in spite of her cosmopolitan background and lifestyle - she inherited a mega-fortune when her first husband, Republican senator and ketchup heir John Heinz, died in a plane crash - Heinz Kerry comes across to voters first and foremost as a modern, outspoken, independent woman.  "My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry and by now I hope it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have something to say," Heinz Kerry began her speech to the Democratic convention.  The comment - which drew wild applause from delegates, especially women - was a reference to her widely publicized "shove it" rejoinder to a journalist.  "She was fabulous, she was magnificent," said Angele Wilson Grant, 38, a black delegate from New Orleans. "She was saying, 'I'm an aggressive woman and I'm opinionated and it's OK for women to be opinionated.' "  Clearly, Heinz Kerry is determined to remain her own woman. She's been known to contradict her husband and only agreed to add "Kerry" to her name after the presidential campaign was under way.  Heinz Kerry also has a style that is uniquely her own. While most women her age have either cut their hair short or wear it up, Heinz Kerry lets her longish brown curls fall in her eyes and face.  Sailing through the Democratic convention's red, white and blue sea of political kitsch, Heinz Kerry stood out in her sleek designer suits of rich green and deep red. She eschews campaign buttons and other political geegaws, and speaks uninhibitedly about the wonders of Botox.  "She is absolutely her own woman. She's not programmed," said Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill.  Such independence and individuality have endeared her to Democratic women activists, who gave her a raucous welcome at women's caucus on Thursday.  It remains to be seen, however, whether Heinz Kerry's spontaneity and refusal to be confined to a traditional model of the political wife will be an asset or a liability with the undecided voters President Bush and John Kerry are vying to win. Nearly 60 percent of those voters are women.  Already, Heinz Kerry has become a target of conservative media outlets and talk-radio hosts.  "The campaign will have a great deal of life because of her saying what she thinks even though some people would says that's ill-advised," said Democratic delegate Margaret Greynolds, a retired communications professor from Georgetown, Ky.  However, whether Heinz Kerry is the voters' idea of a future first lady or not may have little effect on the election outcome, said Debbie Walsh, executive director of the Center for American Women and Politics, at Rutgers University.  "I think that by and large what matters to those undecided women voters is the fact that they need jobs - good-paying jobs," Walsh said. "The fact that Teresa Heinz Kerry speaks her mind on things and has strong opinions isn't going to be the thing that decides what they do in the election."

       Washington Post Lois Romano   John and Elizabeth Edwards celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary today, and they and this small upstate town will not soon forget it.   The John Kerry campaign pulled its 10-bus caravan up to Wendy's restaurant to accommodate the vice presidential couple, who had their first date at the fast-food restaurant and always dine there on their anniversary . This is not one they will soon forget because the celebration included John and Teresa Heinz Kerry, Tom Brokaw, George Stephanopoulos, and 100 members of the media.   "So you understand, this is our anniversary. We always celebrate our anniversary at Wendy's," Elizabeth Edwards told the clerk as she ordered her Classic Combo Single.   Ditto for her mate -- but he went with cheese. And John Kerry went for the Chili and chocolate frosty. The power couples certainly caused a stir -- but it was Ben Affleck who moved with a throng. A Democrat and friend of Kerry's, the movie actor said he joined the trip to learn about the political process and not always be around just for the glamorous work.   Affleck held court as Edwards was shaking hands of potential voters, and Teresa Heinz Kerry answered a few questions from reporters when she strolled out of the restaurant, soft drink in her hand. She described watching her husband and children speak on Thursday night as "pretty surreal," like something "happening to somebody else. . . . Once the kids started having fun, I started having fun," she said.   Asked whether she gave her husband any advice, Heinz Kerry said, "Of course, I always do," and said among the things she told him were, "Remember your mom" and talk about his mother and father. Kerry's parents are both deceased and he referred to both in the opening minutes of his acceptance speech.  Heinz Kerry was told that Newburgh was heavily Republican and a local television reporter asked her how she felt "in the heart of enemy territory."  Sipping her drink, she responded, "It's not enemies. It's Americans. We're all Americans."

       News Observer Lynn Bonner   Elizabeth Edwards told a few humorous stories about her children. Teresa Heinz Kerry urged women to tell their friends about the importance of voting.  The two women married to the men on the Democratic ticket made a joint appearance Thursday, the last day of the national convention, to rally a key constituency.  "Could there be a better, stronger woman than Teresa Heinz Kerry?" Edwards asked in her introduction at the Democratic Women's Caucus. "If there was a cause that was right, this woman reached out and embraced it. That's exactly what we want in a first lady."   The lineup at the meeting included Peggy Kerry, the sister of presidential nominee John Kerry; Carol Moseley Braun, a former U.S. senator from Illinois who briefly ran for president; and Ann Lewis, former communications director for President Clinton, who is working with Democrats to increase the women's vote.  In her half-hour address, Kerry touched on issues as varied as combining work and family, environmental toxicology, psychological research and pay equity, though she offered no policy specifics.  Her clearest message was that more women should vote this year. Studies of voter behavior since 2000 showed that young women and women with children "didn't vote or they didn't necessarily vote their self-interest," she said.  Vengerflutta Smith, 48, a fund-raiser for a Massachusetts health-care organization, appreciated that Kerry talked about topics she was interested in, spoke her mind and occasionally thought about the words she wanted to use.  "She's very real," Smith said. "She speaks to my heart, but also to my mind."  Peggy Kerry talked about what her brother would do if elected, which included appointing federal judges who support abortion rights and spending more to implement the federal "No Child Left Behind" law on education.  The emphasis on women's caucus meetings this week has been getting single women who didn't vote -- which organizers put at 22 million -- to the polls. "John Kerry gets his winning margin from women," Lewis said.  A majority of undecided voters in important states, including the swing state of Pennsylvania, are women, she said.  Moseley Braun, who endorsed Howard Dean after she dropped out of the Democratic field, said she is prepared to do anything she can to elect Kerry.  She was known for her run-ins with North Carolina's former Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.  "I got to go to work with Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond and Trent Lott and that crowd," she said. "I can't tell you how many days I was so glad to see John Kerry."

       Beloit College Weekly Ron Nief   When John and Teresa Heinz Kerry visit Beloit on August 3, perhaps Ms. Kerry can show her husband around as this will be her second visit to Beloit.   In 1992, Teresa Heinz, internationally known environmentalist and social activist and widow of the late U.S. Senator John Heinz, was the speaker at Beloit College’s 142nd Commencement ceremonies.   In her Commencement address 12 years ago, she discussed environmental issues ranging from global warming and ozone depletion to tropical deforestation and loss of biological diversity.   “Sometime they appear beyond our abilities to understand, let alone solve,” she told the graduates.  “Pessimists don’t see any answers and they certainly don’t believe that one person can make a difference. People get discouraged. I am a realist, but I am also optimistic. I see a future where there are immense opportunities for each of us to do good, lasting, and important work."   In announcing her selection as Commencement speaker, then president of Beloit Victor E. Ferrall, Jr. referred to her as “a woman with strong commitments in the areas of the environment, education, human rights and the arts. Ms. Heinz is also the steward of the Heinz philanthropies . . . she is a woman of courage and conviction . . .”   Born and raised in Mozambique where her father was a physician, Ms. Heinz received her B.A. in romance languages and literature from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and did graduate work at the interpreters school at the University of Geneva. She later served as a full-time consultant for the United Nations Trusteeship Council in New York City.   The citation honoring her at the Commencement ceremonies called her a “courageous crusader” and “vibrant force for good in our society.” It noted that “Your life and work stand as admirable testimony to the effectiveness of good citizen involvement and public spirited advocacy. . . We especially honor you today for your long and effective role in promoting an improved quality of life in our nation and in the larger world community. We salute you for your zealous pursuit of difficult, but essential, goals in that quest . .

       AP Libby Quaid   Ask not what you can do for your presidential candidates, but what they can do for you, Elizabeth Edwards told convention delegates from battleground states.  "I know we're asking a lot of you, so I want make certain that you feel completely comfortable during this entire process of letting this campaign know anytime there's something that we can do for you," she told Missouri delegates at a Thursday morning breakfast meeting.  She visited breakfasts for delegations from Missouri, Florida, Iowa, Arizona and South Carolina, just hours after her introduction at the podium of "my rock, my love, and your next vice president, John Edwards."  Her voice sounding a little tired, Edwards explained, "We made a deal with the kids last night, if they were really, really good on the stage, no head-butting, nothing like that, that Emma would get to sleep with her dad, and Jack would get to sleep with me. I will just tell you, I get the raw end of the deal on that one."  She said she and her husband and the Kerrys are looking forward to visiting Missouri next week.  "We know perfectly well that our coming to Missouri is very helpful to you so that you can get out the message," she told the Missourians. "But we also know that the real work of making certain that Missouri is in the right column in November is the work that you all do."  Later, talking briefly with reporters, she disputed the idea that Democrats had written off Missouri because Kerry's campaign stopped advertising there to save money.  "Golly. I don't think all four of us would be headed to Missouri next week if we'd given up on Missouri," she said. "That's a well-kept secret if that's the case."

"I'm only one vote. You're only one vote," said Edwards, the wife of vice presidential candidate John Edwards. "We have to touch as many people as we possibly can."  Edwards, who introduced her husband Wednesday night before his prime-time address, has stressed her extensive family ties to Florida. She was born in Jacksonville, her parents live in Sarasota and her sister lives in Bradenton.  "I have my marching orders. You have your marching orders," Edwards said, telling delegates to "expect to see a lot of me."

       Reuters Ellen Wulfhorst    Want a job that pays no money, requires long hours and promises relentless criticism?   That's the job of a political wife who is or wants to be the first lady in America. It's a job observers say is nearly impossible to carry off.   The way Americans look at their first lady encapsulates the complicated, conflicted way they see women overall, said historian Lewis Gould.   "She is supposed to be articulate and have a cause and be wise and she is supposed to be a homemaker and a dutiful wife and the mother of children," said Gould, who edits the Modern First Ladies Series by the University Press of Kansas.   "If you move from one to the other, you're too outspoken or not domestic enough," he said. "It's a no-win situation."   Teresa Heinz Kerry is a perfect case in point, presidential experts say, especially after the hoopla over her telling a reporter to "shove it."   Her unscripted candor earlier earned her a Newsweek magazine cover with the headline asking if she was a "Loose Cannon or Crazy Like a Fox?"   "Just when I think we've evolved, it seems like we are barely entering the 20th century," said Robert Watson, political science professor at Florida Atlantic University. "The public still has a problem with women in power, and that is manifest most clearly in first ladies."   No matter what they do, candidates' wives face criticism, Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman wrote recently, noting this season's cast of Democratic spouses ranged from doctor and lawyer to stay-at-home mother.   "The good news was that they reflected a large range of choices that are now open to women. The bad news was that whatever choice a woman made, she was going to get trashed," Goodman wrote.   "It's now easier for a woman to be a candidate than to be a candidate's wife, easier to be judged for yourself than to have every move you make, every breath you take, calibrated for its effect on your husband," she added.   Alternately, lying too low can get you strafed as well. Judith Steinberg, the wife of former Democratic primary hopeful Howard Dean (news - web sites), drew acerbic criticism for preferring her medical practice in Vermont to the campaign trail.   NO CONSENSUS   While first ladies get to live in the White House, travel the globe and entertain world leaders, there is no consensus on what they should be, said first lady expert Myra Gutin.   "Our perception of a political spouse is in flux," said the author of "The President's Partner: The First Lady in the 20th Century." "We're not sure if we want her to serve tea or get on the battle lines fighting."   That fighting woman shakes people up, added Gould.   "The 'shove it' episode just shows how far we haven't come," he said. "We want them to be 10 or 15 years behind where women actually are so we're not made uncomfortable by them."   One major reason first ladies spark concern is they are not elected and don't have a mandate from voters.   There's certainly nothing new about first ladies who stir controversy. Eleanor Roosevelt set the modern standard for activist first lady, but since her era, criticism surrounded Rosalynn Carter for attending Cabinet meetings and Nancy Reagan for her designer wardrobe and consultations with an astrologer over scheduling.   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who remains one of the most polarizing figures in politics, has said the job of first lady was "a very unusual role."   "I think people see it through the prism of their own experience," said Clinton, now a Democratic senator from New York.   Watson quipped all first ladies had two things in common. "One, they're all married to a president and two, they have been unfairly criticized," he said.

       Charlotte Observer Anna Griffin   At first glance, the Elizabeth Edwards who introduced her husband to the nation Wednesday seems perfect for this packaged, controlled convention -- a place where even the Pledge of Allegiance appears on teleprompters.  In front of photographers, she gazes adoringly at the vice presidential candidate. On the stump, she stays on-message, offering the occasionally funny aside about her weight problems or her two youngest children, but mostly talking about how great her husband is. She's not the kind of newsmaker who would tell a reporter to "shove it," as Teresa Heinz Kerry did this week.  It sounds like traditional stuff, and that's the point: Elizabeth Edwards isn't your typical political wife, but she can act like one.  "Sure, Elizabeth can do `soft and adoring,' " said Elaine Marshall, North Carolina's secretary of state and a fellow Democrat. "That's because she's smart enough to know when to do `soft and adoring.' "  There's a method to her self-effacing comments about dyeing her hair and dieting. Every time she mentions how youthful he looks at 51 compared with her lived-in 55, she's reminding audiences that they're happily married -- no womanizing problems here. Every time she talks about shopping for bargains at Target or carrying her new Secret Service detail while grocery shopping, she's reminding people that despite his fortune, Edwards is a real person, too.  Behind the scenes, Elizabeth Edwards is her husband's chief adviser, the one who listened to the earliest versions of his convention speech, makes sure his schedule includes time with their three children, and polices his staff to ensure that there are never any awkward photos of him in, say, a protective "bunny suit" at Cape Canaveral. (Just such photos were taken of John Kerry.)  In her speech, she made a subtle but serious poke at the current administration: "I married the smartest, toughest, sweetest man I know ... I married him because he was the single most optimistic person I have ever known."  She and her future husband met in law school nearly 30 years ago. Classmates say Elizabeth Edwards was the smartest student in their class.  By now, the story of their courtship is public record: They began dating early in their first year. She was a Navy brat who grew up overseas. Edwards was handsome and chivalrous, planting a chaste kiss on her forehead after their first night out.  They married at the end of law school and spent their first year of marriage apart. Her first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. Her second produced, Wade. Her third, Cate.  She was a talented lawyer in her own right, the family intellectual who specialized in bankruptcy law but focused as much on her children and her husband as her cases. He was the star, the one winning multimillion-dollar verdicts. Together, they carved out a comfortable life.  Then Wade died, at age 16, in a 1996 car accident. John Edwards quit his law practice and ran for the U.S. Senate. His wife stopped working, took Edwards as her last name and underwent a hormone regimen to get pregnant again. She gave birth to Emma Claire and Jack at age 48 and 50.  "She is a tough, tough, tough woman," said David Kirby, a family friend. "No one should doubt that she has strong opinions and a serious backbone."  So far in the Kerry-Edwards campaign, she's been careful to show only glimpses of that. During her husband's presidential campaign, she told reporters she thought discussion of Edwards as a vice presidential candidate was demeaning, a sort of back-handed compliment meant to lessen him in the eyes of voters.  Voters can expect to see that kind of political candor from her. But it's most likely to come in small doses, surrounded by the more typical personal candor.

       USA Today/Gannett News Service Noreen O'Donnell and Glenn Blain   Where some see an outspoken would-be first lady whose candor could trip up her husband, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton sees a woman who can help win new friends for America.  Teresa Heinz Kerry's worldliness, charm and flair for languages — she speaks five — would be an asset as the country tries to rebuild strained relations throughout the world, Clinton said. She compared Heinz Kerry to Jacqueline Kennedy charming the French during a trip with President Kennedy.   "I don't know that we've ever had anyone in the White House who could speak five languages," Clinton said yesterday. "We're going to need a team in the White House that can repair the damage that's been done to our standing in the world, and I think she'll be an incredible addition to that team."   Clinton made her comments during an interview Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention. She insisted Edwards, a North Carolina senator, was the right choice for the vice presidential slot, despite speculation about what Kerry's selection would mean to her political future.   "I have no control over other people's speculation," she said. "I think he's going to assist the ticket. He's a very intelligent, effective campaigner. He cares about the issues that I think most Americans care about."   Clinton, one of the country's most controversial first ladies, said her advice to Heinz Kerry was to be herself and let the American people see her wit, humor and commitment.   The wife of John Kerry was born in Mozambique to parents originally from Portugal. She speaks English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese — all of which she used in her speech to the convention Tuesday night. And as she told her audience: "By now, I hope it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have something to say."   Clinton said Heinz Kerry speaks out on issues because she cares.   "It's not a role being forced on her," Clinton said. "She's not being told to go out and talk about something she doesn't care about. She's just being herself, which I admire."

       AP   Elizabeth Edwards, who spent months on the road helping her husband's campaign for president, is preparing to address a national audience to promote John Edwards' nomination as the Democratic vice presidential candidate.   "She'll be talking about one of her favorite subjects, which is her husband," said Ed Turlington, the general manager of Edwards' presidential campaign.   Elizabeth Edwards should give a strong performance Wednesday night, say members of the North Carolina delegation who know the former law school standout at the University of North Carolina.   N.C. Secretary of State Elaine Marshall, once a practicing lawyer, went up against Elizabeth Edwards in a bankruptcy case years ago, when Edwards represented a creditor.   "She's very bright," said Marshall, who has known Elizabeth Edwards for at least 15 years. "I always liked cases where I had very talented lawyers on the other side."   Last winter in the early primary states, Elizabeth Edwards routinely campaigned on her own or spoke to overflow crowds at venues where her husband stumped. She joked about looking her age, now 55, while her husband still looks much as he did when they met in law school.   She warned audiences she might have to "plead wife" if they asked questions she wasn't sure how to answer. Then she fielded inquiry after inquiry on her husband's views.   On morning television talk shows, Elizabeth Edwards said her husband's vice presidential acceptance speech Wednesday night will combine the Kerry-Edwards ticket's vision for the future and stories about Kerry the man.   Elizabeth Edwards has been the subject of numerous profiles in the national media since John Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate three weeks ago. They invariably recite the same personal details: that she dyes the gray out of her hair, that she struggles with her weight, that she calls herself the "anti-Barbie," that she's an insomniac (on sleepless nights now, she reads, watches C-SPAN, shops online and sometimes Googles her husband).   She made her first solo appearance promoting the Kerry-Edwards ticket last week in Tennessee, where she dedicated a chapel for the Children's Defense Fund and pledged that her husband will help children, especially those in poverty.   Elizabeth Edwards will be introduced at the convention by 22-year-old daughter Cate, a recent Princeton graduate.   "I'll just talk about her and how great she is," Cate Edwards said Tuesday.   After the convention, Elizabeth Edwards will be back on the campaign trail, both with her husband and by herself.   "The strategy is to use her in as many places as we can as often as we can," said Kim Rubey, a campaign spokeswoman.

       CNN Wolf Blitzer Reports Staff   Two of the words you might hear associated with Elizabeth Edwards are "real" and "unpretentious." For this political wife now in the spotlight -- there's no other way to be.  "If you try to pretend you're something else, be something else, you're gonna be uncomfortable and voters are gonna sense this," Edwards says.  She's a bit of a contrast to Teresa Heinz Kerry, who makes no bones about speaking her mind. The confidence is same, but Elizabeth Edwards has a different style.  "I don't know whether the 'outspoken' and 'direct' are the right description of me. I do know that I try to speak with people openly and if it doesn't work, that's who I am. I wouldn't change it," says Mrs. Edwards.  Elizabeth Edwards was born in Florida and spent part of her childhood in Japan where her Navy pilot father was stationed.  She went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for both undergraduate and law school, and married John Edwards just days after taking the bar exam.  A successful legal career followed, along with children Wade and Cate.  But Wade's death in 1996 rocked the family. As Elizabeth Edwards put it, "The music went out of our lives."  In her late 40s she had two more children -- Emma Claire and Jack -- often seen on the campaign trail -- which can sometimes be a challenge.  "What you have to do is just prepare them and hope that you have taught them a little bit of manners. That doesn't mean that they won't occasionally take the cheese heads they've been given by the staff and head butt one another," says Edwards.  As for her role, Elizabeth Edwards says she sees herself as a sounding board for her husband -- and alerts him to things she thinks he should know. There have also been solo campaign appearances -- something she may do more of as the presidential race moves into its final weeks.  "This is such an important election that I have expressed my willingness to do what ever I need to do to get this ticket elected in November," says Edwards.

       The Enterprise Jennifer Kovalich   Teresa Heinz Kerry would be a first lady similar to Eleanor Roosevelt, says John Walsh of Abington.  "She is uniquely warm and she is insightful in a way that is calm," Walsh said Tuesday night after Heinz Kerry's speech to the Democratic National Convention at the Fleet Center.  Walsh, a delegate from Abington, was sitting in the row behind Jim Roosevelt, the grandson of the nation's only four-term president, as he watched Heinz Kerry's speech. "I think she'll be a first lady that will be direct," he said.  When Heinz Kerry took to the podium in a red suit at 10:32 p.m. Tuesday, Tina Turner's hit "Simply the Best" belted through the sound system and Heinz Kerry was greeted by rousing applause from thousands of delegates waving a sea of red and white signs that read, "We love Teresa!"  After an introduction by her son, Chris Heinz, Heinz Kerry wasted no time in getting to the heart of the debate about her reputation for outspokenness.  "My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry. And by now I hope it will come as no surprise to you that I have something to say," she said, eliciting cheers.  In a 20-minute speech, Heinz Kerry retraced her roots from growing up in the dictatorship of Mozambique in East Africa to her marches against apartheid in the late 1950s. She spoke of how special the liberties enjoyed in America are to her before launching into the many reasons she says her husband, Sen. John F. Kerry, should be the next president.  "I know how precious freedom is. It is a sacred fight, sanctified by those who have lived it and those who have died defending it," Heinz Kerry said.  "My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called 'opinionated,' is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish," she said. "My only hope is that, one day soon, women —who have all earned the right to their opinions— instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart and well-informed, just as men are."  Sheila Burgess Hill, a delegate from Randolph, compared Heinz Kerry to such first ladies as Hillary Clinton and Jacqueline Kennedy.  "Hillary Clinton was a very strong lady and elegant. Jackie O. was a strong and passionate first lady," Burgess Hill said. "I think Teresa Heinz Kerry would bring that same passion and elegance as first lady."  While first ladies have no official duties, their personalities and approach to the role have often stirred debate and controversy.  Eleanor Roosevelt, first lady from 1933 to 1945, a period when the nation endured the Depression and World War II, was known for her sensitivity to the underprivileged and her advocacy on social problems.  Jacqueline Kennedy is remembered for bringing glamour, culture and youth to the White House, in contrast to Barbara Bush's grandmotherly demeanor, Hillary Rodham Clinton's political activism and Laura Bush's more traditional supportive role.  Brockton City Councilor-at-large Thomas Brophy, before heading into the convention Tuesday night, said he likes Heinz Kerry's style.  "I met her during the last Senate campaign. She came to Brockton and spoke at the Caffrey Towers (housing complex). She made an incredible impression on me," Brophy said. "I like the fact she speaks her mind."  Heinz Kerry drew attention earlier in the week when she told a Pittsburgh Tribune Review reporter to "shove it" following a speech she made at the Statehouse in Boston.  Brophy said he and others got a chuckle out of the remark.  "It certainly was not as disrespectful as what the vice president said to Sen. (Patrick) Leahy," Brophy said, referring to the expletive Vice President Dick Cheney used during a recent argument with the Vermont senator over Halliburton, the energy company Cheney once led.  Caitlin Brophy, 20, the city councilor's niece, also likes the spunk she sees in Heinz Kerry.  "I've just seen her on the news. She seems exceptionally outspoken. Mrs. Bush, you don't hear from her at all."  Sen. Marc Pacheco, D-Taunton, said Heinz Kerry would be "a first lady of the world."  "She is a very knowledgeable, independent, and extremely articulate individual," Pacheco said.  Burgess Hill, the Randolph delegate, said she does not consider Heinz Kerry too outspoken.  "I think it's important to speak passionately about important issues," Burgess Hill said.  Heinz Kerry did just that in her speech Tuesday night, particularly when talking of her husband and his platform.  She painted the portrait of a man who will move the country forward with new jobs, new technologies that will continue to probe the depths of space, and opportunities for families for access to affordable health care and good schools. She also acknowledged her husband's war record and how that has shaped him.  "For him, the names of too many friends inscribed in the cold stone of the Vietnam Memorial testify to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength. That is why, as president, my husband will not fear disagreement or dissent," she said. "He believes that our voices —yours and mine— must be the voices of freedom. And if we do not speak, neither does she."  With John F. Kerry in the White House, Heinz Kerry said the nation would chart a course for the return of an America that provides hopeful leadership again, shoulders its moral obligations and preserves freedom.  "Together we will lift everyone up," she said. "We have to. It's possible. And you know what? It's the American thing to do."  After listening to Heinz Kerry's speech, Thomas Brophy said he was moved by her history of growing up with apartheid and involvement in the movement against it.  "This is someone who knows what liberty is all about because she saw it when she was younger being all infringed, and I think she conveyed that now in America there are freedoms that are being infringed, people who speak out against the government are being labeled unpatriotic," Brophy said.  Walsh, the Abington delegate, called the speech "wonderful."  "I like that she's extremely focused on her family while at the same time she's working on issues that are important," he said.  Brophy said Heinz Kerry proved she has what it takes to be the country's next first lady.  "She has the class, the poise and will also be a different first lady in that she's going to speak her mind. I like that," he said. "With John Kerry as president and her as first lady, this nation will be in good hands."

       The New York Times Marian Burros/Jim Rutenberg   Ever since voters began telling Teresa Heinz Kerry that they didn't think much of the pumpkin spice cookie recipe her office had submitted to Family Circle's presidential cookie bake-off, an aide said, Mrs. Heinz Kerry, the wife of the about-to-be Democratic nominee, has been thinking how she could tell America the truth: the recipe isn't hers.   In an interview on National Public Radio that was broadcast yesterday, the cookies came up in conversation and in the direct, unvarnished style that people have come to expect, Mrs. Heinz Kerry said: "Somebody at my office gave that recipe out and, in fact, I think somebody really made it on purpose to give a nasty recipe. I never made pumpkin cookies; I don't like pumpkin spice cookies."   Mrs. Heinz Kerry had originally submitted a recipe called Yummy Wonders, but, according to Family Circle, its test kitchen said the recipe did not work. When the magazine called her press office and asked if there had been a mistake, the press office sent the pumpkin cookie recipe without consulting her, said her press secretary, Marla Romash.   Christine Anderson, Mrs. Heinz Kerry's press secretary at the time the recipe was submitted but who now works elsewhere in the Kerry campaign, would not comment and referred all calls to Ms. Romash.  The recipe, and a Laura Bush recipe for oatmeal-chocolate chunk cookies, were published in the July issue of the magazine. Readers were asked to vote on their favorite. In the first bake-off, Hillary Rodham Clinton's cookies won over Barbara Bush's in 1992, and since then the winning cookie has foretold who would enter the White House.  Blame Mrs. Clinton for what has led to cookiegate. In a 1992 appearance on "60 Minutes" she defended her career as a lawyer by saying, "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas." The contest was almost inevitable after that.   Mrs. Heinz Kerry is reputedly a good cook, and good cooks are usually upset when their names are associated with inferior recipes.  Ms. Romash, who when she is not working in politics runs a baking-catering business, agrees with her boss. "If you tasted those cookies," she said, "you'd think someone was trying to do you harm, too."   Ms. Romash would not say why Mrs. Heinz Kerry would think an aide would want to harm her.   Not everyone agrees with Mrs. Heinz Kerry: in taste tests on television programs, tasters were evenly divided, said Susan Ungaro, editor in chief of Family Circle.

       USA Today   Pity Teresa Heinz Kerry. As she prepared to address the Democratic convention Tuesday night, Newsweek's damning cover question earlier this year provided the psychological backdrop: "Is John Kerry's Heiress Wife a Loose Cannon - Or Crazy Like a Fox?"  Talk about a no-win choice. When she snapped, "shove it," at a reporter Sunday, a media mini-frenzy revived the question.  So what, exactly, has happened in the 12 years since candidate Bill Clinton promised an unprecedented policy-making role for his lawyer wife, Hillary? A vote for him, he said, would mean "two for the price of one." Remember how the country seemed so ready for a smart, independent first lady back then? Implicitly, she would help continue the helter-skelter roll women were on toward greater political power.  Quite a roll it was. Politically, 1992 was the "Year of the Woman." Twenty-four claimed new seats in Congress, nearly doubling female representation on Capitol Hill to 54. But that plateaued in 2002 at 74, where the number is today, just 13.6% of Congress.   The reason "you go, girl" has slowed into "not so fast, baby" reflects the nation's ambivalence about what it expects from a first lady - one that's grown as women's lib has lost steam. Heinz Kerry is experiencing it the hard way. She may be one of America's richest women, running a philanthropic foundation, but her unruly hair and Botox injections get more coverage.  First lady Laura Bush has avoided controversy only by sticking with her shy librarian image and such safe subjects as education. But do we really want a first lady whose only option is to return to the 1950s?  In fact, a whiff of change may be in the air. Every four years, the conventions showcase presidential nominees. But the women in their lives also duke it out in competing images. Heinz Kerry and John Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, a lawyer, are still managing to come across as intellectual partners. In response, Laura Bush is addressing such hot-button issues as stem-cell research.  And while it may not be a flood, women are making incremental gains. Hillary Clinton has become a poster woman of hope as a senator, reviving talk of a female president one day. Women have been secretary of state and, currently, national security adviser. Of three in the Bush Cabinet, two are the first women to head their departments.  Still, letting first ladies be themselves, not battering them into seclusion or insipidity, can help break the psychological logjam. To twist President Kennedy: Ask not what a first lady can do for us, but what we might do for her. Answer: Give her a break.

       Boston Herald Jill Radsken   Elizabeth Edwards doesn't shy away from her full figure.    Style watchers said the 54-year-old wife of vice presidential candidate John Edwards doesn't hide herself in dark colors and shapeless silhouettes like many large women do, but rather shines in soft colors and attractive separates.    ``She reminds me of the girl next door,'' said Lesley Greer, general manager of Neiman Marcus in Boston. ``She's a classic beauty.''    Greer described Edwards' style as casual without being frumpy - a natural for American designers to dress.    ``St. John would be a wonderful look for her,'' Greer said of the apparel line that specializes in high-end knitwear. ``It always looks fresh.''   Ginger Burr, president of Total Image Consultants in Boston, said she expects Edwards' style to be slightly refined as Election Day nears but complimented her appearance as being as ``approachable'' as her manner.   ``She has a natural sparkle to her,'' Burr said.   Neiman Marcus' Greer added that both Edwards and Teresa Heinz Kerry present themselves as straightforward, but the wife of the vice presidential candidate comes off as less intimidating.   ``Elizabeth makes it known she wants people to be more interested in what she's saying than what she's wearing,'' she said.

       The Daily Star Jack Mazurak    What Laura Bush or Teresa Heinz Kerry say when they get to a microphone isn’t going to sway voters, area residents and visitors said Tuesday.  Heinz Kerry, wife of presumed Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry and heiress to the Heinz ketchup fortune, spoke Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.  But a cross section of shoppers and workers at the Southside Mall said Tuesday that when it comes to choosing a president, the candidate’s spouse is a secondary consideration.   "It is important, but it isn’t a factor that would sway my vote," Hobart resident Bill Webb said. "You have to look at them as a team and look at their style."  Sara Vanderlan, a J.C. Penney cashier, said she won’t look to Heinz Kerry or Laura Bush when she makes a decision.  "They’re not as important as the candidate’s views," she said. "To some extent she could have an effect, but she’s not the one being voted in."  Heinz Kerry made waves Sunday when she told a journalist to "shove it." Since then, the Kerry campaign has tried to paint her as a stand-up individual who will say what needs to be said.   Laura Bush, meanwhile, has kept a low profile as her husband vacations in Texas.  St. Louis resident Hugh Spalding said candidates’ spouses don’t make a huge contribution, though if they’re extreme, they can hurt the election effort.  "They do have power, because they have an in with the candidate," Spalding said.   He said he was in town for a baseball tournament at the Cooperstown Dreams Park but was spending time Tuesday with family at the Southside Mall because the tournament was rained out.  As a Republican, Spalding said, he’d like to see more of Laura Bush.  "She didn’t get out much. There were too many other issues — terrorism and the wars. There wasn’t much spotlight left for her," he said. "In good times, they have more opportunity."  Meredith resident Paula McCormack said a first lady should be friendly and outspoken while providing a window into her husband.  "She gives you broader perspectives on the candidate — his personality and his qualities," she said.  Marcia Mumm of Boca Raton, Fla., who was also visiting for baseball reasons, agreed.  "She says something about the candidate," Mumm said. "Isn’t who you marry the most important choice you make in your life?"  A New York City man said issues come before spouses when he goes into the voting booth.  He and his wife, who preferred not to give their names, said they were visiting their summer home upstate.  "It’s the husband that is the candidate," he said. "She has power, like in any marriage, but I don’t look at her as much."  He said Hillary Clinton was great in the first-lady role and in a few years, he said, he wouldn’t mind seeing Bill Clinton as the first gentleman.  Sam Bradshaw of Walton said he pays no attention to the candidates’ wives — but he also said he doesn’t follow politics.  "They are going to do whatever they are going to do when they get in office," he said. "I’m not registered and am not planning on voting."  Although those asked Tuesday said a candidate’s wife doesn’t make or break the election, they were divided on what a first lady should be — domestic role model or crusader.  Webb said he admired Eleanor Roosevelt’s fortitude and social work.  "She was more for my generation," he said. "(A first lady) has to be able to withstand the social rigors of the position. She has to be strong."  Mumm said a president’s wife should be clean-cut, wholesome and have good family values.  Another Florida resident, a middle-aged mother from Jacksonville who preferred not to give her name, said Laura Bush has been quiet to the point of nonexistent.  "We know you are there — use the office to promote your agenda," she said.   A first lady should pursue the goals she did before moving to the White House, only more forcefully, she said.  "If you’re not in politics to begin with, then stay out," she said. "Do what you were good at and be strong."

       Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Cindi Lash and Steve Levin   While you're wading through the coverage of the Democratic National Convention, take a moment to ponder this: Whose ties to Western Pennsylvania go deeper, Elizabeth Edwards' or Teresa Heinz Kerry's? If you guessed Edwards, congratulations.  While Heinz Kerry is well known for her Fox Chapel farm and the philanthropic work of foundations bearing her former married name, she can't hold a pierogi to Edwards' long-standing local roots.  Edwards is scheduled to address the convention tonight. While she'll have members of her extended family with her in Boston, others scattered throughout Western Pennsylvania will be watching intently.  One will be Tony Vigliotti, 80, of Brownsville, who was startled to discover while reading a newspaper on a family vacation a few weeks ago that Edwards' maiden name was Anania -- the same surname of the cousins with whom he'd visited, played and shared Sunday dinners decades earlier in Brownsville.  The connection was clinched when he compared a newspaper photo of Elizabeth Edwards to his parents' 1922 wedding portrait. The bridesmaid in the ornate black dress and feather-trimmed hat, Mary Anania, was the cousin of Vigliotti's mother. She'd lived with her husband, Flores Anania, in Marianna, Washington County, and in Brownsville for nearly 20 years before moving in 1940 to Oakland. Among their three children -- they also had two daughters -- was a son, Vincent, now 82, the father of Elizabeth Edwards.  "When I saw [Edwards'] face in the picture, I knew. I see a strong resemblance to her grandmother's face," said Vigliotti, who attended Brownsville High School with Vincent Anania. "My family is all talking about it and I've gotten so many phone calls over it, I can't tell you."  The Ananias lived in a roomy house on Market Street in the business district of the once-bustling town. The house no longer stands, but Vigliotti has vivid memories of visiting on Sundays with his parents and inhaling the smells generated by Flores Anania's concoctions from his work as a pharmacist and chemist.  Vincent Anania was a Boy Scout and a first-string player on the Brownsville High School football and basketball teams before graduating in 1938, said classmate Robert Petriello, former sports editor of the now-defunct Brownsville Telegraph newspaper and the town's current tax collector. He still has his copy of "On the Mon," the yearbook in which he and Anania are pictured, beaming from club and sports team photos. Anania graduated in 1939 from the Kiski School, where he played football and basketball, and was a member of the glee and debating clubs.  He spent two semesters at the University of Pittsburgh before being appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. It was there that Anania, a strapping 6 feet 1 or 2 inches tall, made a name for himself. He was an All Big-East football player and earned All-American honors in lacrosse.  Anania graduated from the Naval Academy in 1945, and over the years his postings took him and his family to Japan, Italy and along the East Coast of the United States. In 1959, he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross after helping pilot a P4M-1Q Mercator reconnaissance flight back to its Japanese base after it was attacked by two North Korean MiG-17s.  His mother eventually moved in with one of his sisters in a large home on Wallingford Street in Oakland. Each year, gatherings would be held there where cousins got reacquainted with one another, and Elizabeth Edwards got her first taste of Pittsburgh. Anania's sister still lives in the area.  "We actually used to visit Pittsburgh fairly often," said Nancy Sims, 52, of Bradenton, Fla., Edwards' younger sister.  Although Sims couldn't remember many details -- she was in a hurry to pack for a flight to Boston for the convention -- she did recall winter drives to Pittsburgh and trips on the inclines.  Her father made a point of telling the children about their Pennsylvania heritage. For an athlete, sports had an important role -- specifically, the Steelers and the Pirates. "We were basically instructed that they were our teams," Sims said.  Vigliotti has never met Elizabeth Edwards, and he thinks it's been at least 20 years since he had any contact with her father's family. Vincent Anania suffered a stroke 14 years ago and is in a rehabilitative hospital in Sarasota, Fla.  Still, Vigliotti is thrilled about Elizabeth Edwards' prospects.  "I think it's great," he said, grinning. "My whole family just can't get over having a relation that may be someday in the White House. We're very proud."

       AP Jennifer Peter   Elizabeth Edwards described her husband Wednesday as ``the smartest, toughest, sweetest man I know'' - a natural born fighter who has always had the optimism to see the ``brighter day ahead.''   Sounding familiar themes from the campaign, Edwards chronicled John Edwards' rise from humble beginnings to legal stardom and - ultimately - to the halls of the U.S. Senate, driven by the desire ``to make the great opportunities of America available to all Americans.''   ``He knew there was a brighter day ahead, even as he swept the floors in the cotton mill. He knew if he worked hard enough, he could be the first in his family to go to college. He knew that he could outwork and out-tough any battalion of lawyers to find justice,'' said Edwards, who was greeted to the packed convention floor with a sea of signs that read ``Elizabeth.''   Edwards also recalled a time her husband dressed up as Santa Claus for an inner-city child care center. ``You know, he even looks dashing in a Santa suit,'' she said. ``If the cause was just and his voice was needed, he was there.''   Edwards has called herself an ``anti-Barbie,'' a down-to-earth, 55-year-old mother who left a high-powered law career after the death of her oldest child, Wade, eight years ago, at age 16, in an auto accident.   She has called that event the ``A.D.-B.C.'' moment of her life. The Edwardses decided to have more children as a way to lead themselves and their daughter Cate, 22, through the pain.   Aided by hormone treatments, Edwards was pregnant with Emma Claire, now 6, during her husband's first run for the U.S. Senate in 1998. She had Jack, 4, when she was 50.   Edwards was introduced by her daughter, Cate, a recent Princeton graduate, who described ``the next Second Lady of the United States'' as a woman ``with a strength that inspires, with a courage that carries on.''   Like Teresa Heinz Kerry, Edwards spent much of her youth abroad, attending school in Japan, where her father - a decorated Navy pilot - was stationed.   She married John Edwards, her law school sweetheart, in 1977, the weekend after she passed the bar exam. She clerked for a U.S. District Court judge and worked in the North Carolina attorney general's office. Since the birth of her youngest children, she has been active in two foundations dedicated to Wade.   While her speech focused on Edwards, she drew comparisons between her father and her husband's running mate, both Navy veterans.   ``Like John Kerry, my father fought for this country,'' she said. ``Like John Kerry, he was decorated risking his life in her service. My father had another thing in common with John Kerry and with so many of our uniformed men and women across this country and around the world: He has the right stuff. I married a man with the right stuff.''

       CNN Sean Loughlin   Teresa Heinz Kerry, an unconventional and outspoken political spouse, declared Tuesday night it was time to "hear women's voices" as she appeared before the Democratic National Convention to make the case for her husband's election to the White House.  "This evening, I want to acknowledge and honor the women of this world, whose wise voices for much too long have been excluded and discounted," Heinz Kerry, 65, told an enthusiastic, receptive audience of delegates and alternates inside the FleetCenter. "It is time for the world to hear women's voices -- in full and at last."  The widow of a Republican senator and the wife now of a Democratic senator, the African-born Heinz Kerry addressed her reputation for speaking her mind -- at times bluntly.  "My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called 'opinionated' is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish," she said to loud cheers. "My only hope is that, one day soon, women who have all earned the right to their opinions -- instead of being called 'opinionated' will be called smart and well-informed, just like men."  Turning to the election, Heinz Kerry called her husband "a fighter" and said John Kerry would lead the nation by "showing the face, not of our fears, but of our hopes."  Heinz Kerry never mentioned the Republican opposition, but praised her husband. She referenced, for example, his military service during the Vietnam War -- a theme frequently advanced by the Kerry campaign.  "He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country," she said.  A wealthy benefactress -- by virtue of the vast fortune she inherited with the death of her first husband, John Heinz -- Heinz Kerry also turned to issues she has focused on with her charitable organizations: the environment, children and women.  "We can and we will create good, competitive and sustainable jobs while still protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our children, because good environmental policy is good economics," she said.  Her speech, delivered in a soft Portuguese lilt, was scripted -- a change in style for a woman known for her off-the-cuff comments.  Heinz Kerry grabbed headlines at the start of the convention after telling a reporter to "shove it" when he questioned her about a speech she had given -- in which she touched on the erosion of civility in politics.  That remark and her penchant for straying from the political message of the day seemed to tickle many delegates at the convention.  Beuenia Brown, a delegate from New York, said Heinz Kerry's candor was refreshing. "I think that when a person is outspoken, I think of them as honest," Brown said. "I don't see them as having to connive. They're speaking from the heart."  Tim Mauldin, a delegate from Oklahoma, agreed. "She's just an example of a woman who doesn't feel it's her place in politics to be quiet."  Heinz Kerry's path to the American political scene was circuitous. She was born in Mozambique, the daughter of a Portuguese doctor and his British-born wife. She became a U.S. citizen in 1971.  Educated in South African and Swiss schools, she speaks several languages, including French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. She sprinkled her speech with words of welcome in those languages.   "I have a very personal feeling about how special America is, and I know how precious freedom is," Heinz Kerry said.  She met Heinz while she studied at a graduate school in Switzerland and he worked as a banker. Heinz, who later became a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, was killed in a plane accident in 1991. The couple had three sons, one of whom, Chris, has been a high-profile campaigner for his stepfather.  Chris Heinz introduced his mother Tuesday night, calling her "a true visionary," "a remarkable woman" and the "next first lady of the United States."  She married Kerry in 1995, and she became a Democrat in 2003.

       Reuters John Whitesides   Teresa Heinz Kerry, in the spotlight on the second night of the Democratic convention, said on Tuesday her husband John Kerry was a fighter who would vigorously defend America, restore truth-telling in the White House and "always be the first in the line of fire."   The sometimes outspoken Heinz Kerry was the feature attraction on a long night of speakers who painted Kerry as a decisive leader who would rebuild the credibility of the White House and send President Bush back to Texas after November's election.   "John Kerry offers hope, not fear," said Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democratic legend who welcomed the delegates to his and Kerry's hometown with a twist on Franklin Roosevelt's Depression-era warning that the only thing Americans had to fear was fear itself.   "Today we say the only thing we have to fear is four more years of George Bush," said Kennedy, who added that his fellow senator from Massachusetts could once again make America "a light to the world."   Heinz Kerry and stepson Chris Heinz were scheduled to close the evening by offering Americans a more personal view of the Democratic presidential candidate.   Heinz Kerry said in remarks prepared for delivery that Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, "earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country."   But she drew a contrast with Bush's decision to launch a war in Iraq and said he would only send American soldiers into war when necessary.   "For him the names of too many friends inscribed in the cold stone of the Vietnam Memorial testify to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength," Heinz Kerry said.   Other speakers planned for later in the evening include Ron Reagan, son of the former Republican president, who will push to lift restrictions that Bush has supported on stem cell research.   ( urlLink ... )  Kerry's running mate, Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, arrived in Boston on Tuesday afternoon before his speech to the convention on Wednesday. His wife, Elizabeth, will visit the convention to watch Heinz Kerry's speech.

       Independent News Rupert Cornwell    The list included Howard Dean, once Mr Kerry's fiercest rival for the nomination and the man who electrified audiences on the campaign trail last year. There was the star catch from the enemy, Ron Reagan Jr, the son of the brightest icon of modern Republicanism. There was the old liberal lion Ted Kennedy, and Barack Obama, the neoliberal lion of the Democrats' future. But this second evening of the Democratic convention belonged to Teresa Heinz Kerry.  The candidate's wife was appearing at a watershed in the campaign, 48 hours before the acceptance speech that could make or break John Kerry's White House bid - and at a time when George Bush seems to be regaining ground.  After weeks of being battered by Iraq and then the announcement of John Edwards as Mr Kerry's running mate, the President led his rival by 48 to 46 per cent in a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, reversing a trend of several weeks. Above all though, Mrs Kerry represented something absent this week, a frisson of unpredictability and a breath of controversy.  In fact, the controversy has already begun. Hours after telling a reporter from the conservative-leaning Pittsburgh Tribune-Review to "shove it", the equally conservative Boston Herald breathlessly unearthed a 1975 book about political marriages yesterday.  According to the book, Teresa, who was then married to the late Republican senator John Heinz, once declared that Edward Kennedy - now a close political ally of her husband - was a "perfect bastard" if he was maintaining his marriage to his former wife Joan merely to avoid upsetting the Catholic vote.  The Herald also dug up some remarks she made in 1976 to the effect that the Democratic party machine was "putrid". Yesterday, the Kennedy camp laughed off the fuss. But the episode only underlines how the extraordinary career of Mrs Kerry (who only formally left the Republican party in early 2003) will provide material galore for the Bush/Cheney campaign's muck-raking Opposition Research Department. But will they choose to use it, and if so, how?  For Republican campaign strategists, those are tricky decisions. Elections are not won and lost by first ladies, and attacking a potential one may be seen as unfair. None the less, first ladies are part of an overall presidential package. If voters can be discreetly made to feel uncomfortable with Mrs Kerry, that may be bad news for her husband in an election campaign as close as this one.  By accident or design, each presidential spouse seems a reaction to the last. The homely Barbara Bush with her twinsets and pearls was the antithesis of the Hollywood-tinged, fiercely protective Nancy Reagan. Then came the strong-minded, smart career woman Hillary Clinton. ("Heck, if you don't like him, don't vote for him," she told a TV interviewer in 1992, when questioned about her husband's alleged infidelities.)  Next up was Laura Bush, the opposite of Hillary. This Mrs Bush is a former librarian and schoolteacher, an unobtrusive home maker whose political contributions extend no further than a dewy-eyed gaze at her husband and uncontroversial speeches about her pet subject of education.  Now there is the very real possibility the next First Lady of the United States will be a daughter of Portuguese colonialists in Africa, owner of five homes and fluent in as many languages.  Mrs Kerry speaks her mind in breach of all the norms of political wife-speak. Her $500m-plus fortune renders her beholden to no one. Indeed, she has made clear that if her husband reaches the White House, she will continue her philanthropic and pro-environmental work. In her White House days at least, Hillary Clinton was a shrinking violet by comparison.  In terms of sheer exoticism, even Jackie Kennedy, with her cosmopolitan background, does not come close to Mrs Kerry. With her trace of an accent, her designer clothes and slightly world-weary manner, she has been described as resembling a famous European actress of a certain age.  If you live in Kansas (or even in large parts of Massachusetts) she must come across as a very foreign creature indeed. Almost certainly, the Republicans will seek to use that perception to reinforce their contention about her husband, that John Kerry is out of the American mainstream.  Last night, however, the unscripted, off-the-cuff Mrs Kerry was deliberately packed away, as she prepared to deliver her prime-time address to this most scripted of conventions. "Normally I don't have a text," she told an interviewer yesterday, "but this time I've been working on the speech for weeks." It would be personal, and she hoped, "an inspiration" to those who hear it.  But did she regret her words to the Pittsburgh reporter? "No, no one likes being trapped or misrepresented."

       The Hill Geoff Earle and Albert Eisele   Teresa Heinz Kerry has emerged as a potential problem for Sen. John Kerry’s meticulously scripted convention strategy.  The candidate’s outspoken wife will deliver a prime-time speech to the convention tonight but has already touched off a flurry of media attention by telling a reporter for a Pittsburgh newspaper to “shove it.”   Her remarks, to the editorial-page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, delivered before Pennsylvania delegates, were seen as a distraction at a time when the Kerry-Edwards campaign is trying to project an image of total unity and harmony.  The comments also have little to do with her core convention role, which is to highlight her husband’s personal qualities and leadership ability.   In a convention environment without much hard news, even the slightest unscripted comment attracts attention.   Mary Beth Cahill, Kerry’s campaign manager, was bombarded with questions about the “shove it” comment during a breakfast with more than 60 journalists hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.   Cahill and another top Kerry campaign aide, Tad Devine, spent most of the hour talking about plans for various speakers ranging from former President Clinton to Sen. Edward Kennedy (Mass.) to help “tell the story of John Kerry’s life” before he and his running mate, Sen. John Edwards (N.C.) address the convention Thursday night.  Then The Washington Post’s David Broder brought up the subject of Heinz Kerry’s comment to a reporter who challenged the veracity of one of her statements to the Pennsylvania delegates. “Who’s in charge of keeping her on message?” Broder asked.  “She just says what she thinks,” a clearly discomforted Cahill replied. “She’s her own person. She’s a great asset to the campaign.”   Devine added, “She has a way of putting things that are very, very powerful,” drawing laughter from the reporters.  When another reporter, Jack Farrell of the Denver Post, observed that the Kerry campaign must be worried about the unscripted remarks of the wife of the soon-to-be Democratic presidential nominee, Cahill replied, “There are things that you can do and things that you can’t.”  Other top Democrats had already been defending Heinz Kerry, despite her outspoken reputation, before the convention even began.  Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) at first demurred when asked to provide some advice to the candidate’s wife on the eve of her speech. “I think she’s going to do great,” Clinton told The Hill last week. “You just have to be yourself.”  “Teresa is fabulous,” Clinton continued. “She’s got extraordinary ability. She’s going to do it on exactly her terms — which is exactly what she should do, and the crowd and the country are going to love her.”  But Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.), who has himself drawn attention for sharp-tongued remarks, offered no advice to Heinz Kerry. “I’m just not going to get into it,” he said.  Republicans, however, have not hesitated to warn that Heinz Kerry’s proclivity for speaking her mind could present a liability for Kerry.   “That’s going to be wild if she gets to be first lady,” said Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.). “You’ll have to have somebody assigned to that.”  Asked about Heinz Kerry’s convention speech, Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho),  replied, “She’s obviously a very strong person. I would guess they would want to show that and demonstrate it.”  Craig also said it would be “interesting” to see what kind of a role she would play as first lady.  Many observers, though, say it doesn’t much matter what any of the Democratic speakers say this week. Party officials will vet almost every word uttered by any of them.  “This convention, as will ours, will be the most ignored in American history,” Sen. Robert Bennett (R-Utah) predicted.  As yesterday’s meeting between the Kerry campaign officials and the journalists ended, one reporter commented, “The ultimate irony would be if the story line from this breakfast is that John Kerry has a woman problem.”

       The New York Times Jim Rutenberg   It was exactly what many Democrats had dreaded: Teresa Heinz Kerry, the candidate's wife, running off the carefully laid rails at the Democratic National Convention here.  On Monday, prevailing images on cable news were not of Senator John Kerry throwing the first pitch at Fenway Park the night before, but those of his wife laying into the editor of a conservative newspaper and telling him to "shove it" before a horde of other journalists. As Mr. Kerry and his aides began what they have billed as a four-day showcase for the candidate's "positive vision for America," they were repeatedly forced to explain his wife's comment.   Then, Mrs. Heinz Kerry took on a staff member. In an interview to be aired Tuesday on NPR, she disowned a pumpkin spice cookie recipe that had been submitted to Family Circle magazine for a bakeoff between her and Laura Bush. "Someone had made it on purpose to give a nasty recipe," she said.  All in all, it was not an atypical 24 hours for Mrs. Heinz Kerry, the billionaire philanthropist who has shown a flair for saying whatever she thinks, whenever she thinks it, in a way that is wholly foreign to the political operatives overrunning this city this week.   When Mrs. Heinz Kerry addresses the convention here Tuesday night, it will be the culmination of a months- long journey for her and her husband's campaign staff in which a "let Teresa be Teresa" philosophy has come to prevail. In part, aides say, that is because she is among the best promoters of her husband, but also because there is no other choice.   Mrs. Heinz Kerry has had a net positive effect on the campaign, infusing it with some welcome spontaneity and excitement, current and former campaign aides say. But it has not come without some jostling for her husband and his staff members, who have learned over the course of several hard months to deal with her unpredictability.  Some campaign staff members had misgivings about Mrs. Heinz Kerry's potential effect on the campaign from nearly the beginning, for several reasons.  Born of Portuguese parents in Mozambique, educated in Switzerland and South Africa, her accent - best described as pan-European with a hint of Africa - was not considered a draw for the crucial voting bloc Howard Dean coined "the guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks."  Then, there was her fortune, now estimated at $1 billion - an enviable back-up campaign kitty that, some feared, could potentially give Mr. Kerry the air of a hanger-on nonetheless.   But, most worrisome of all, there was her personal style.   "There was a feeling early on," said a former staff member, "that she was a liability: The fact that she was from another country, the fact that she wasn't programmed, wouldn't stay on script."  Another former adviser to Mr. Kerry added: "The conundrum was, 'Do you just let her go out there and do her thing or not?' The other choice was to try to jump in and really manage it."  Mr. Kerry, during a telephone interview in June, played down nervousness about his wife among his staff. "I think this, quote, nervousness, has been overexaggerated, and rumored," he said, "and perhaps someone in the campaign had that sense or something, but it's never been a campaign view, or my view."  But Mrs. Heinz Kerry more readily acknowledged it during an interview at the campaign's headquarters in June.  "I tell you something: I would say probably any campaign in this town would have had a hard time figuring out how to use me because they were not used to having someone with my clout, or baggage, or whatever - or experience," she said. She continued, nearly stream of consciousness-like, "Do you feel that you're being railroaded, or do you feel that you're being absorbed - do you feel inferior, or do you feel superior? What is it you feel? So I think any campaign would have had to adjust to that, because most spouses that have come in have kind of fitted into whatever it is."  She added, "I can't be packaged, I won't be packaged. If I have to be packaged, then I can't be part of the process."  She made that clear early on, when, in early 2003 a new public relations handler assigned to her submitted a memorandum detailing how she could take better care with her makeup and hair before television appearances.  Mrs. Heinz Kerry rejected the advice angrily, offended by what she saw as an effort to turn her into someone she was not, several people familiar with the incident said.  That was not the first time Mr. Kerry's campaign ran afoul of his wife, especially when it was under the management of Jim Jordan, who was fired in November.   Several former and current staff members said Mrs. Heinz Kerry was eager to get out and speak on behalf of the campaign and felt as if Mr. Jordan did not do enough to use her on the stump or in the news media. Mr. Jordan's supporters and detractors agree that if he had had a better relationship with Mrs. Heinz Kerry he may have survived, or, at least, survived longer, in his job.  Mrs. Heinz Kerry was reluctant to comment too much on her view of Mr. Jordan, at one point saying flatly, "I don't know Jim Jordan very much at all.''   Mr. Jordan's successor, Mary Beth Cahill, certainly made her available to the news media and on the stump far more often, especially this past spring.  She sat for a prime-time, one-on-one interview with Barbara Walters and was the willing subject of cover articles in Newsweek and People and of a CBS Evening News profile.  "She is exactly what she seems to be, she is her husband's best asset,'' Ms. Cahill said during a breakfast with reporters held by The Christian Science Monitor here on Monday. "The way that she talks about him is one of the strongest views into him - his character - that it's possible to give, and we think that she's great."  People at the campaign said they became more comfortable with Mrs. Heinz Kerry as they saw her success on the speaking circuit, where she mixes deep policy knowledge on environmental and health care issues - honed as the head of the Heinz family endowments - with a casual speaking style.  After the spring, aides said they were pleased with her discipline at staying on message. "She's been disciplined and smart,'' Mr. Jordan, who would not otherwise comment on his relationship with her, said in early July. "Her press has been great, and she's been an altogether terrific asset.''  To be sure, Mrs. Heinz Kerry can connect especially well with women, even those who would be able to provide two week's worth of groceries for their families at the cost of a pair of Mrs. Heinz Kerry's Chanel shoes. At a meeting with mostly poor community leaders on the North Campus of Miami-Dade Community College in late June, she at once delighted the women-only crowd and made herself wholly relatable by saying, "At the end of the day, no one asks a woman, 'Do you need a neck rub? Do you need a drink, honey?' '' Her off-the-cuff, politically incorrect sense of humor, which has gotten her into trouble in the national news media, can also get real laughs, as it did at another recent women's group meeting in Orlando, when she said of China, "Of course, they have more people than ants there.''  Her interaction with the conservative writer occurred after she addressed the Democratic delegation from Pennsylvania, where she maintains her residence. Mrs. Heinz Kerry had told the audience, "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics.'' After the speech, the editorial page editor of The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Colin McNickle, asked Mrs. Heinz Kerry what she meant by "un-American,'' prompting Mrs. Heinz Kerry to argue that she had never used the term and eventually saying angrily, "You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."  The line did not go over well with some delegates here. "I think it could hurt her,'' The Associated Press quoted a delegate from Memphis, Lexie Carter, as saying. "I'm not sure how it will play but I'm coming down on the side of 'it's O.K., but let's cool it - keep a level head, girl.' ''  Mr. Kerry's campaign aides, by now accustomed to finessing his wife's more lively moments, tried to use them to their advantage. And they and their surrogates said she was merely venting at a conservative newspaper that has been critical of her for years. It is owned by Richard Mellon Scaife, a prominent supporter of the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups.  "She was approached by a conservative local rag that over the years has consistently misrepresented her and her family,'' said Debra DeShong, a campaign spokeswoman. "And she's always going to stand up for herself when she feels like someone misrepresenting the truth.''   Senator Hillary Clinton, no stranger to conservative media as a candidate's wife, went one better: "A lot of Americans are going to say, 'Good for you, you go, girl,' and that's certainly how I feel about it.''  Speaking in Florida, Mr. Kerry said, "I think my wife speaks her mind appropriately.''  Either way, the incident renewed questions about whether she would continue to be the free campaign spirit she has been so far. During the interview in June, Mr. Kerry had been emphatic that she would not be reined in. "The folks in our campaign are thrilled with what she's doing," he said. "They're going to let Kerry be Kerry and let Teresa be Teresa, and that's the way we're campaigning, and they don't have any choice in the matter. How's that?''

       The Denver Post Suzanne S. Brown    She's being called her husband's secret weapon and hailed as an "everywoman." People who have never met her say she is warm and approachable.   Elizabeth Edwards is the "It Girl" for the Democrats, whose national convention is underway in Boston.  Sure, Teresa Heinz Kerry is the more visible woman next to her husband, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, on the podium this week. But people may relate better to a 51-year-old woman juggling motherhood, marriage and the South Beach diet than a 60-something philanthropist and political spouse.  It doesn't hurt that, like two-thirds of American women, Edwards appears to be a size 12 or larger. Or that she had a job as a lawyer for many years but gave up her career to devote more time to her family. And that she's credited with being whip-smart and keeping her husband, Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards, grounded.  "I can relate to her, because I'm kind of a big girl myself," says Elbra Wedgeworth, president of the Denver City Council and a convention delegate.  Wedgeworth has "nothing against women who are size 10" but says many of the women she knows are bigger than that and comfortable with it.  "Women today have a lot of responsibilities, a lot of things to do. People relate to Elizabeth Edwards because she is juggling kids and a family," the councilwoman says.  "The thing that is engaging about her is that she is an incredibly accomplished person in her own right," says Nancy Taylor Farel, a Boulder image consultant whose clients have included political spouses. "When you see her, the way she carries herself and interacts with her children and family, she appears at ease.  "People relate to her on many levels - her bravery at becoming pregnant at a late age, and at having survived tragedy (the death of her teenage son several years ago)," Farel says. "She could be our neighbor, a person we feel confident talking to across the fence.  "And even having a movie- star-handsome husband, she's very self-assured," Farel adds. "It's so refreshing in a time when there is so much polish that is put into candidates."  While acknowledging that it's shallow to judge people in the public eye by their clothing, people do it, she says. The image consultant says she'd probably put Edwards in more fashionable outfits. "She looks more like a mom who has been home a lot rather than a woman who has been thrust onto the world's stage."  Edwards' preference for pants and jackets rather than skirts and dresses, and few accessories, seems driven more by practicality than formality. She's more like "a working person than a poster girl for her husband's ambitions," Farel says.  Among those racing to dress Edwards, as well as other political wives, is Ellen Tracy, the New York sportswear company.  "We sent a look book and knew that she likes our clothes," says Laura Holbrook,spokeswoman for the company. "They told us that she was looking for clothes to wear to the convention."  Edwards recently visited the Seventh Avenue showroom and tried on a number of outfits but found just one, a black stretch silk faille pantsuit and a claret-colored charmeuse blouse. Summer suits by Ellen Tracy are about $800 and blouses about $200, Holbrook says.  "It makes so much more sense to wear pants when you're getting out of cars and planes all the time," Holbrook says. "And stretch silk faille is a great fabric - it travels well, and the wrinkles will steam out if you hang it in the shower."  So, is Edwards the typical Ellen Tracy customer?  "We tend to find that the women who like our clothes are well-educated, have busy lives and seek out clothing that is fashionable without being overly trendy," Holbrook says.  And, as it turns out, many of their high-profile customers are Democrats. Tipper Gore, Geraldine Ferraro and Jane Gephardt have worn Ellen Tracy. (To cover its bases, the company also sent look books to Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney.)  Edwards has a reputation as a discount shopper, according to a recent article in People magazine, which listed pantsuits from Marshalls and Saks Fifth Avenue among the items in her wardrobe. She also consulted her staff rather than fashion advisors on what outfits to take on the campaign trail.  "She's a very pretty woman, very appealing, with a great smile, wonderful demeanor and warmth," says Tish Jett, fashion director of Figure magazine and co-author of "Figure it Out," (Sixth & Spring Books, $17.95), which offers dos and don'ts for plus-size women.  The fashion director says she'd like to spend 30 minutes with Edwards to advise her on what to wear. First, Jett says, she'd emphasize "the magic vertical line," and suggest Edwards wear monochromatic outfits that elongate her figure. Also good are patterns such as pinstripes, because they pull the eye up and down rather than horizontally. Jett also recommends wearing navy blue or eggplant rather than black. "It's softer and kinder," Jett says.  Wear suits "all of a color rather than chopping the body in half," she says. "If you're going to wear jewelry, keep it around your face or wear it long. Don't let it fall into your bustline," she says, adding, "Pearls are unbelievably flattering."  To complement her blue eyes, Edwards should consider wearing electric blue, turquoise or pink jewelry, Jett says.  She also recommends wearing "interesting shoes." Not killer high heels, but "kitten heels, or a little bit of heel to make you feel feminine."  But Farel doesn't want to see the handlers tamper too much with Edwards. "It's part of what makes her authentic," she says. "She's not a skinny mini and shouldn't be forced to try to look like one."

       The Herald Sun Rob Shapard   Although he couldn't quite place her, longtime Orange County farm owner Gordon Neville knew there was something very familiar about the lady who pulled into his tree-shaded yard off Old Greensboro Road.   It was in early June, and the lady was in the market for land. She came by the Neville place, known as Mount View Farm, to see some property that Neville and his wife Pat owned.   "When she got out of the car, I had no idea who she was," Neville said Monday. "I kept looking at her, and finally, I said, 'I think I've seen you around Chapel Hill.'   "She said, 'No, you probably haven't seen me around Chapel Hill. Maybe you've seen me in Raleigh,' " Neville said.   And then the name and the face came together.   His eyes lit up, and he asked her, "You're that Edwards lady, aren't you?" And so she was.   Elizabeth Edwards, the wife of Democratic U.S. senator and vice presidential candidate John Edwards, rode with Neville in his pickup truck for a quick tour of the farm that day, but she didn't end up striking any deals.   However, the Edwards family did buy about 102 acres of land next door, adding another item to the family's résumé -- Orange County taxpayers.   John and Elizabeth Edwards are listed in county records as the new owners of 102 acres on the northern side of Old Greensboro Road, as of June 24. They paid $1,316,500 for the land, which is just east of Sesame Road and west of Phil's Creek Road.   Along with the Edwards' names, the county records include a mailing address of 190 Finley Golf Course Road in Chapel Hill.   That's the same address as East-West Partners, the company headed by local developer and UNC trustee Roger Perry.   Perry returned a phone call seeking comment Monday, but a reporter missed his call and couldn't reach him a second time.   The land is about four miles from West Franklin Street in Chapel Hill, and about 2¼ miles from the Carrboro town limits, which reaches almost to University Lake. The land purchased by the Edwards family is within the Chapel Hill-Carrboro school district.   According to Neville, the location within the city schools district was one of the main draws for the family, which now lives in Raleigh and Washington, D.C.   "[Elizabeth Edwards] said they want to come out here and live, out in the country," he said. "The main reason she gave was the school system. That's what she told me.   "She was just as down-to-earth and pleasant as can be," he added. "She's like a regular gal."   Kim Rubey, a spokeswoman for Edwards, confirmed Monday that the family had purchased the land. But she said she would have to call back with any further details, such as the family's future plans for the property.   There was, of course, the small matter Monday of the start of the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Both John and Elizabeth Edwards are scheduled to speak Wednesday at the convention, along with their daughter, Cate. The Edwards also have two young children: Emma Claire and Jack, who are 6 and 4, respectively, according to campaign materials.   John Edwards graduated from N.C. State University in 1974, and went on to law school at UNC, where he and Elizabeth Anania met. They were married not long after graduating in 1977.   About 12 years ago, they set up a lacrosse scholarship at UNC in memory of Elizabeth Edwards' father, Vincent Anania, who was a former lacrosse player and assistant coach at UNC, according to campaign materials.   In 1998, John Edwards was elected to the U.S. Senate. He made a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in this election, but he bowed out as U.S. Sen. John Kerry opened a lead. Kerry asked Edwards to be his running mate this summer.   Neville said that beyond the comments Elizabeth Edwards made about the local schools, there wasn't any discussion of the family's long-term plans for the property. Neville said the lot is completely wooded, and home to a lot of deer.   The Guthrie family previously owned the land -- most recently, brothers Paul and Bobby Guthrie. Their father, Paul N. Guthrie, who was a well-known UNC professor, bought the land in the late 1940s, Neville said.   "Most of the old-timers out here remember that land as the Jesse King farm," Neville said. "He lost it all, plus a lot of land in Carrboro, during the Depression."   The story goes that in the late '40s, Paul Guthrie was getting his hair cut at the Friendly Barber Shop in Carrboro, which was owned by the Sturdivant family. By then, the Sturdivants owned the 102 acres, and Guthrie heard that they were selling the land. He bought it soon thereafter, Neville said.   Neville, 65, said that his land has been in his family since the late 1700s. He still raises beef cattle and runs a neat, well-mown operation, although he described farming as just a hobby these days. He also worked in the paper industry for many years.   In recent years, residential growth has crept westward down Old Greensboro Road from Carrboro and Chapel Hill, with the development of subdivisions like Sturbridge and Stoneybrook. But the vista heading west toward Alamance County still includes a lot of hayfields, farmhouses and ponds.   Neville said that he and his wife haven't heard any major concerns from other neighbors. And Neville said they didn't figure things would change too much if the Edwards family ever moved there, although he said the fact that the land sold for more than $1 million could put more pressure on him to sell some of his land some day.   But Elizabeth Edwards sounded sincere in wanting to build a home on the land at some point, he said.   "It probably won't change our lives an awful lot," Pat Neville said. "We'll probably just invite them to church, offer them lemonade and offer to watch their kids sometime."

       Chicago Tribune Lisa Anderson    When it comes to prospective first ladies, Americans have never seen anything quite like Maria Teresa Thierstein Simoes-Ferreira Heinz Kerry.   If there were any lingering doubts about that, she spectacularly put them to rest on the eve of the Democratic convention here.   After making a speech to Pennsylvania delegates Sunday night, in which she lamented the decline of civility in American politics, an angry Kerry pointedly and very publicly told a journalist to "shove it." Television cameras dutifully chronicled every turn in the peppery exchange.   But it hardly was the first time the Mozambique-born billionaire has tossed around the kind of words or opinions that make political consultants shudder. And it is not the only element that makes Kerry, who speaks five languages and favors designer fare from Chanel, Giorgio Armani and Hermes, an exotic prospective first lady.   Five years older than her husband, the 65-year-old Kerry has said that after leaving the dictatorship of the then-Portuguese-ruled colony of Mozambique, one of the things she most appreciated was freedom of speech--a right she often exercises with a remarkable lack of inhibition.   Speaking in a soft, low voice, still spiced with the accent of her native Portuguese, Kerry is known for sometimes stunning candor. In an famous 2002 Washington Post interview, she said, "I love my husband;" she was referring to her late first husband, U.S. Sen. H. John Heinz III, who was killed in a 1991 plane crash. She also has talked about the prenuptial agreement that she required Kerry to sign to limit his access to her wealth.   As recently as Sunday, she spoke about John Kerry with Chris Matthews on MSNBC's "Hardball" program and told him that "you wouldn't want to have a beer with John, because John is not a beer drinker. He doesn't drink much, period. He's boring that way."  The timing of her "shove it" comment, however, was stunningly unfortunate, coming the night before the convention would be gaveled to order and some 48 hours before she was slated to address the delegates in prime time Tuesday night.   On Monday, CNN repeatedly showed the "shove it" encounter. It also polled its viewers on a question many political observers have asked since it became clear that John Kerry would run for the White House: "Does Teresa Heinz Kerry help or hurt her husband's campaign?"   Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (news - web sites) of New York, a woman who rarely minces words, considered the incident to be more positive than problematic. "I think a lot of Americans are going to say, `Good for you. You go, girl," she told CNN on Monday. She may have been thinking of polls indicating Americans' low opinion of the media.   Candidate supports wife   And John Kerry, the presumptive presidential nominee, firmly backed his wife.   "I think my wife speaks her mind appropriately," he said Monday. In May 1995, Teresa Heinz, who was introduced to Kerry by her late husband, married Kerry, who had been divorced from Julia Thorne since 1988.   What set off the contretemps was a question posed to Kerry by Colin McNickle, editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, a daily with a staunchly conservative bent. Kerry had told her home-state delegation, "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics," according to a videotape.   As Kerry left the gathering, McNickle asked her what she meant by "un-American."   Kerry responded by asserting several times, "I didn't say that," before walking away.   But a short time later she returned to confront McNickle. She asked him who he worked for and produced an acidic smile at his answer, saying, "Of course." Then she turned away, but quickly whipped around and told McNickle, "You said something I didn't say. Now, shove it."   A campaign spokesperson officially chalked up the incident up to "sheer frustration aimed at a right-wing rag that has consistently and purposely misrepresented the facts in reporting on Mrs. Kerry and her family."   Such indecorous sentiments have been expressed even by other first ladies, according to Myra Gutin, professor of communication at New Jersey's Rider University and author of the 1989 book "The President's Partner: The First Lady in the 20th Century."   "That's the kind of thing that can follow you forever," said Gutin. She recalled a moment during the 1984 presidential race when Barbara Bush, wife of GOP presidential candidate George H.W. Bush, sought a way to describe Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate and the first woman to run on a national political ticket.   Barbara Bush told reporters, "I can't say it, but it rhymes with rich."   Although many first ladies have been affluent in their own right, the enormous personal wealth of Teresa Heinz Kerry is another unusual element. Married for 25 years to her first husband, Kerry was left with three sons and most of the Heinz fortune upon his death. She controls the $1 billion Howard Heinz Endowment and is an active philanthropist, especially in such personal areas of interest as the environment and children's issues.   Former Republican   A woman who only last year added Kerry to her name and switched from being a lifelong Republican to registered Democrat, Teresa Heinz Kerry appears to be as strong-minded and independent as a Hillary Clinton, but without the political killer instinct.   Nonetheless, her sterling former GOP credentials may come in handy for the campaign, according to Anthony Mughan, a political scientist at Ohio State University. She can possibly reassure conservative and GOP voters about Kerry, he said, and "make him less fearsome to Republicans, that he is not this massively liberal Massachusetts Democrat who is going to take all your money and taxes and drain America."   In fact, as a stay-at-home mother when her children were young, Kerry is as traditional, in many ways, as a Laura Bush. Wearing her hair in an often unruly and tousled cap of curls, Kerry projects an effortless look, but readily admits to gaining weight on the campaign trail and using Botox to erase her wrinkles.   Last week, in Sioux City, Teresa Heinz Kerry thanked Iowans for helping her "figure out how I would do out on the trail, campaigning for my husband . . . not afraid of making mistakes, but not very sure of myself."

       Philadelphia Inquirer Amy S. Rosenberg   Is there a Teresa factor?  When Teresa Heinz Kerry has her convention moment Tuesday night, will the Kerry campaign be holding its breath, the opposition eagerly awaiting that trademark Teresa candor?  Does her celebrated unscriptedness, still percolating reliably along the campaign trail, and her breathtaking wealth, still causing eruptions of controversy in conservative circles, make her a wild card in the election?  Or has the wife of John Kerry become, through months of generally well-received campaigning, not so plump a target after all (even as she characteristically owns up to plumping up by 10-plus pounds herself)?  Folks on both sides no doubt raised their alert level after Sunday's less-than-first-ladylike "shove it" remark to a journalist (a mitigating factor) from a conservative Pittsburgh paper that has long had her in its sights.  The Kerry campaign is now hoping her convention speech will put back on display the whispery speaking manner, the exotic yet earthy persona, the global deep-thinking perspective, the practiced but never plastic image, the casual hair-in-face glamour, the constant reacting to little intimacies around her that have captivated smaller groups around the country.  Several GOP strategists suggested in recent days that the notion of Heinz Kerry as a liability, some sort of ticking time bomb of flakiness, had pretty much evaporated, though they stand at the ready for the sort of "vast-right-wing-conspiracy/didn't-stay-home-and-bake-cookies/rhymes-with-witch" gaffes that have snagged past presidential candidates' wives.  "Shove it" was not a bad offering.  "That's the nuttiness that we're looking for," GOP strategist Michael Cohen said Monday. "It puts people on notice. There's going to be the watch. The next thing she says will be a big deal."  GOP pollster David Winston said: "Whatever incurs will be self-inflicted. Republicans won't have to say a thing."  Heinz Kerry, 65, whose first husband, Republican Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, died in a 1991 plane crash, told reporters over the weekend that her 20-minute speech - her first with a teleprompter - would cover "familiar themes" and that she was its author.  Heinz Kerry has in fact played well on the campaign trail, giving speeches about her childhood in Mozambique under a dictatorship, marching against apartheid, watching her father vote for the first time at age 71. She says she believes people out in the heartland can embrace the complexity of her ideas and personality, as well as her husband's.  She's been chummy in front of women's groups, motherly with little children (she did not hesitate to try to extract the thumb of Jack Edwards from his mouth during a pastoral photo op); goofily unrehearsed with her husband (they fumbled the hand-holding-on-the-couch on "60 Minutes"). Of Portuguese descent, she can deliver her speech in Spanish. Born in Mozambique, she has occasionally called herself African American.  She has also been willing to take swipes at President Bush for things like not being Socratic enough. ("He actually reads," she said of her husband recently, in an implicit contrast with the incumbent.)  Her supporters insist she has more than proven herself an asset to the campaign, and her improvisational manner helps offset her husband's staginess.  For his part, Kerry seems comfortable with who she is, her frequent references to her first husband and her bluntness.  "He's at his best when he's with her," says longtime friend Wren Wirth. "He's relaxed. She really delights him. He gets it. He thinks she's terrific. You see the chemistry."  And so Teresa apparently is free to be Teresa, though no doubt the campaign would prefer no more hotheaded dust-ups with reporters. Even amid the pleasantries of a Ladies Home Journal interview, John and Teresa managed to disagree with each other; George and Laura did no such thing during theirs.  In any case, most political strategists discount the impact any spouse will have.  "Given how polarized this race is already, I don't even see the vice presidential candidates being a factor, let alone the spouses," said GOP strategist Larry McCarthy, who has known Heinz Kerry since he was press secretary to Sen. John Heinz.  Heinz Kerry's appeal might be strongest with women who like her strong personality, and, billions aside, can relate to a life that has involved both traditional pursuits and ambitious ones. For all her achievement as head of the Heinz family philanthropies - funding programs in the environment, urban revitalization, the arts and education - she has also shown herself willing to go full-tilt for her husband. She has hometown appeal in Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh's mayor calls her Saint Teresa.  "I think Teresa Heinz Kerry, much like Hillary Clinton, is somebody who is true to herself and will be herself," said Lisa Caputo, former press aide to Hillary Clinton. "That's what the American public would want, instead of faking something you're not."  For all her bluntness and humor, much of the time it is at her own expense - talk of Botox, being called sexy at age 65, approving appraisals of John Edward's looks. And until last year, Heinz Kerry was a Republican, which could mute some critics. As she said on "60 Minutes": "First of all, those very same people never criticized my late husband for his money or his wealth. In fact, they used it - and his money was just dandy."  Still, her wealth remains an area of contention. Republicans want her to release her tax returns, and right-wing groups have seized on the recipients of Heinz foundation money, portraying some as extremist and calling her a "bag lady for the radical left."  Wirth, like others who go back decades with Heinz Kerry, predict the public will embrace her. "Regardless of what happens at the speech, not that many people are watching the speech," Wirth said. "When they're in office, and people have a chance to get know her, I think they'll be absolutely enchanted."  McCarthy, the former John Heinz aide, is keenly aware of what it took - both tragedy and resilience - to bring her to this moment. "I don't think she's ever really sought out the limelight. Life just takes some strange twists and turns. I'm happy for her."

       Canadian Press  Ron Fournier     Shove it, then rhyme it with rich. Then roll it in a batch of baked cookies and teas.   Teresa Heinz Kerry joined the company of blunt-speaking political spouses this convention week by telling a reporter to stop misquoting her and "shove it." Barbara Bush set the standard in 1984 when she called Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro a $4 million "rhymes with rich" during the campaign to re-elect president Ronald Reagan and Mrs. Bush's husband, vice-president George Bush. She later apologized.   Nine years later, Mrs. Bush was first lady when future Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her active role in public life by saying, "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas."   Mrs. Clinton expressed regret for the remark, saying she had been referring to "the ceremonial role" of the first lady.   Heinz Kerry has not apologized. Her husband said he's not sorry.   "I think my wife speaks her mind appropriately," Kerry told reporters Monday.   Her mind spoke freely Sunday night, when she told Pennsylvania delegates, "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics." She criticized the tenor of modern political campaigns without being specific.   The editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review asked her what she meant by the term "un-American."   Heinz Kerry repeatedly denied using the phrase. "You said something I didn't say," she told the journalist. "Now shove it."   Some convention delegates were not impressed.   "I think it could hurt her," said Lexie Carter, 52, of Memphis, Tenn. "I'm not sure how it will play but I'm coming down on the side of - 'it's OK, but let's cool it. Keep a level head, girl."'   "It's the kind of thing that could hurt her stature as a potential first lady," Carter said.   Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who worked in several Republican administrations, said most voters won't have any problem with Heinz Kerry's outburst. It might even help her shed a reputation as a cool, regal woman of wealth, he said.   "We've been waiting for the real Teresa, and it strikes me that we're starting to get her," Hess said.   Privately, strategists close to the Kerry campaign agreed with Hess' assessment but worried that the outburst might be a sign that Heinz Kerry might have trouble staying on message during the campaign.   After showing unusual discipline throughout the spring, she made aides wince by calling Kerry running mate John Edwards beautiful and her husband smart - a contrast that played into the hands of Republican critics of the Democratic ticket.   Political spouses can cause political problems.   Nancy Reagan turned to an astrologer to help her husband run the White House, former Reagan chief of staff Donald Regan wrote in a book.   Laura Bush distanced herself from her husband's anti-abortion views shortly after his election. Tipper Gore took on the music industry, a Democratic fund-raising base, before her husband became vice president. Lynn Cheney has not been afraid to speak out during her husband's vice-presidential tenure.   "But it's a short list," Hess said. "Like little children, political wives were supposed to be seen but not heard for much of American history."   Not anymore. Not with Senator Clinton jumping to the defence of Heinz Kerry.   "A lot of Americans are going to say, 'Good for you, you go, girl,"' the New York senator said, "and that's certainly how I feel about it."

       TSM Harry Bruinius    Teresa Heinz Kerry's unabashed approach is a plus for some voters, a concern for others.  When Teresa Heinz Kerry speaks, there's often a glint of mirth in her eyes, as if she were aware that she doesn't fit the classic template for American political wives.  Oh, she understands the game. But in this era of slick political image-making and carefully planned spin, she just rolls her eyes and refuses to play. Her easy self-confidence and exotic looks - not to mention her Portuguese lilt - make Ms. Heinz Kerry seem more a character from a European novel than a future first lady. And her startlingly straight answers to questions most would evade are enough to make any campaign handler squirm.  Botox injections? Of course. Actually, she says she may need another soon. A pre-nup with John Kerry to protect her $500 million-plus fortune? Absolutely, a must. Her husband's running mate? "I have to say that John Edwards is very beautiful," she says.  So Tuesday night, when Heinz Kerry takes the podium at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, many people across the nation will catch their first glimpse of one of the most unusual would-be first ladies in the nation's history. Born in Africa, fluent in five languages, her unruly hair a copper color more common with women half her age, she strikes a figure rarely seen in US politics. "She is absolutely her own woman," said Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill at a Monitor breakfast with reporters.  That's both good news and bad news for political staffers. Asked if the campaign is trying to control what their candidate's wife says, Ms. Cahill offered an indirect answer. "There are those things you can do, and those you can't," she said.  Today some see Heinz Kerry's sometimes blunt candor as a refreshing departure from scripted talking points. Others worry that during a time of such rancorous political divisions, such independence could only inflame the raging culture wars.  "She is definitely a change," says Myra Gutin, a professor at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., and author of "The President's Partner: The First Lady in the 20th Century." "She would be only the second foreign-born first lady we'd have. She's been very candid - some might say unguarded.... Even in her most flip moments, Hillary Clinton was never like this."  Take her name. She freely admits that her legal name is, and will remain, Teresa Heinz. The addition of "Kerry," she says, was simply a nod to the needs of the campaign. "Now, politically, it's going to be Teresa Heinz Kerry," she once told a woman's magazine. "But I don't give a [expletive], you know? There are other things to worry about."  She is far from a demure spouse. Instead of gazing lovingly at her husband while he's speaking, she can fidget and even frown. In one of their first interviews, before Senator Kerry had announced his presidential bid, she flew into a rage in front of the reporter, prompting a less-than-flattering story of the couple.  "Part of the electorate looks at the relationship between a candidate and his wife, and they wonder - not out loud - is this the kind of marriage of which I'd approve, or our circle would approve?" says James Hilty, a presidential historian at Temple University in Philadelphia. "So the Heinz-Kerry relationship is a tad odd in this time of enormous partisanship."  Then, for some, there's the issue of her "worldliness." Maria Teresa Thierstein Simoes-Ferreira was born in 1938 to Portuguese parents in colonial Mozambique. Her father, a doctor, used to take her on his calls in the African bush. Later, when she was studying Romance languages in South Africa, she marched against apartheid when it was a dangerous thing to do. She met her first husband, the ketchup heir H. John Heinz III, who would later become a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, while studying languages in Geneva.  "The worldliness that she brings to things would be a tremendous asset," says Adam Turteltaub, a close family friend. "The fact that she was raised in Africa, and has seen a great deal of the world, and has an international perspective because of that - I can't think of too many first ladies who have brought that in."  Yet "worldliness" is a quality many "red state" voters might find suspect. Her exotic appeal is for others something foreign and perhaps even un-American. Indeed, Senator Kerry has described the "fullness of her womanness," describing his wife as "very earthy, sexy, European. She knows how to speak with her eyes."  It was her late husband who first introduced Teresa to Kerry at an Earth Day event in 1990. When Senator Heinz was killed in an airplane crash in 1991, many Pennsylvania Republicans urged Teresa to take her husband's seat. But she declined, instead taking charge of the family's philanthropic empire. She married Kerry in 1995, after the two met again at an environmental summit in Brazil.  Heinz Kerry remained an active Republican until 2002. She still believes the government should harness the forces of the marketplace for the public good, and as a Catholic, she has sometimes spoken critically of abortion. She changed party affiliations, she says, not because her husband was running for president, but because of the "unscrupulous and disgusting" way Georgia Republicans attacked former Democratic Sen. Max Cleland, a veteran who had lost both legs and an arm fighting in Vietnam. Today Teresa Heinz is chairman of both the Heinz Endowments and the Heinz Family Philanthropies, a consortium of private foundations that control more than $1.3 billion in assets.  "Democratic voters in the East and in California likely will be drawn to her independent, outspoken style," says Mr. Hilty, "while the Bible Belt folks apparently prefer the Laura Bush good-mother, good-wife style."

       Financial Times Joshua Chaffin and James Harding   Teresa Heinz Kerry, whose prime-time speech will be the main attraction at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, was already getting some valuable, if unwanted, airtime on Monday. After telling Pennsylvania Democrats it was time to restore a tone of civility to American politics, she was caught on camera telling a local journalist to "shove it!".   As the Kerry campaign sought to orchestrate a convention that refrains from Bush-bashing and delivers a positive message, the TV networks were airing footage of the argument. "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics," said the wife of John Kerry, the Democratic challenger.  When asked by a journalist from a conservative Pittsburgh newspaper what she meant by "un-American", she said: "I didn't say that." When he continued to question her a little later, she said: "You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."  Over months on the campaign trail, Mrs Heinz Kerry has established a reputation as the one thing that anally retentive, risk-averse campaign managers fear most: a loose cannon.  Whether she is calling her husband's running mate, John Edwards, "very beautiful" or discussing her experience with Botox, Mrs Heinz Kerry has displayed a degree of candour almost unheard of for a political wife.  She even managed to court controversy at an innocuous photo-opportunity. When the Kerry and Edwards families posed for the cameras, Mrs Heinz Kerry was seen clearly trying to stop the adorable little Jack Edwards sucking his thumb - an uninvited intervention in the upbringing of somebody else's son.  "She's shown right from the first days of the primaries that she really shoots from the hip, and I think some people find that very refreshing," says Myra Gutin, a historian at Rider University.  Mary Beth Cahill, the Kerry campaign manager, insisted on Monday that Mrs Heinz Kerry was a huge asset to the Massachusetts senator's election effort. When asked whether the campaign was "sitting on her pretty hard", she laughed, resignedly: "There are things you can do and things you can't."  But the Kerry campaign is presenting her straight-talking, sometimes off-message style as a strength. "She is her own woman. She just says what she wants," Ms Cahill said yesterday, noting that Mrs Heinz Kerry was being given unprecedented prominence by being scheduled to speak at the heart of tonight's prime-time schedule.  Mrs Heinz Kerry and her counterpart, Laura Bush, demonstrate the vast cultural differences separating their husbands, and in a larger sense, the US. While one is independent and outspoken, the other has been described by John Zogby, the pollster, as "the perfect red-state wife, with the perfect smile, who always remains one step behind".  Whether voters find her refreshing or flaky, it seems clear Mrs Heinz Kerry would make a first lady unlike any in American politics.  For one thing, she was not born in the US. The daughter of a Portuguese doctor, Maria Teresa Thierstein Simoes-Ferreira grew up in Mozambique and then studied in Switzerland. Her English, one of her five languages, is still accented from her days in Africa.  She is also independently wealthy, with a fortune estimated at more than $1bn as a result of her first marriage to Senator John Heinz, heir to the ketchup empire.  Mrs Heinz Kerry currently oversees family philanthropic endowments that hand out tens of millions of dollars each year in grants. She was thrust into the role following her husband's death in an aircraft crash in 1991, and has since won acclaim for promoting women and children's health issues, urban environmentalism and other causes.  "She rose to be a leader of the foundation so that it didn't flounder," said Kathy Davis, who has done consulting work for the Heinz Endowments for 20 years. "She's there at the meetings, she's talking to the staff. She's definitely not absent."  The money has contributed to a criticism that Mrs Heinz Kerry can be a bit too dismissive of the sometimes absurd obligations of a candidate's wife. For Mr Kerry, whom she met in 1992 at an environmental summit in Brazil, it has proved something of a mixed blessing.  While Mr Kerry has been able to enjoy her five homes, stretched from Nantucket, Massachusetts, to Sun Valley, Idaho, he has relinquished whatever tenuous claim he might have made to being a man of the people. Republican operatives have also picked through his wife's vast stock portfolio for companies that have moved headquarters offshore or committed other sins that Mr Kerry has blasted on the campaign trail. The central question posed by Mrs Heinz Kerry, however, is whether she is an asset or a liability to her husband's campaign. Even Republicans concede that her presence has helped to humanise Mr Kerry, who suffers from a wooden demeanour in his public appearances. "She sort of takes the rigor mortis out of him," one lobbyist said.  But Mrs Heinz Kerry's unscripted nature also lends itself to gaffes. There is, for example, her tendency to still refer to her late husband on occasion as her "husband".  Despite concerns over her unscripted nature, Mr Kerry has unleashed his wife with abandon. In fact, she often travels on her own aircraft, the Flying Squirrel, campaigning without him.  At a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, on Saturday, Mrs Heinz Kerry presented something of a mixed bag. She was affecting when she told voters in a whispered, accented voice how Iowans had given her confidence early in the primaries when she was still uncomfortable campaigning.  However, as she launched into a lengthy, rambling speech, elderly supporters wilted in the sun. Mrs Heinz Kerry also took the unusual approach of blasting Mr Bush herself, accusing his administration of dishonesty and cynicism. A traditional first lady would have showered her husband in praise and avoided the fray.  "She was kind of down-to- earth," said Sadie MacDonald, a recent high school graduate from Sioux City. Her friends called Mrs Heinz Kerry "plain-spoken" and said she "spoke from the heart".  The senator's wife shows no signs of toning down her act. When asked recently if Kerry campaign handlers had advised her to change her style, she replied: "You know, I can only be me. And I also know that's not what the American people want. They don't want phonies. They don't want pretence - they want real people - and I'm a real person."  And the Kerry campaign is just learning to live with the reality. When Ms Cahill and Tad Devine, another senior Kerry campaign official, were asked at a breakfast for reporters yesterday morning who was in charge of keeping her on message, they - and everyone else - just laughed.

       AP Peter Jackson   Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry doesn't have a problem with his wife telling an insistent journalist to "shove it" when urged to explain her plea for more civility in politics. Neither does Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.  "I think my wife speaks her mind appropriately," Kerry told reporters Monday when asked about the exchange between his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, and the editorial page editor of the conservative Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.   Asked about the response on CNN's "American Morning," Clinton said Monday, "A lot of Americans are going to say, 'Good for you, you go, girl,' and that's certainly how I feel about it."   Heinz Kerry attended a Massachusetts Statehouse reception Sunday night for fellow Pennsylvanians, telling them, "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics." She criticized the tenor of modern political campaigns without being specific.   Minutes later, the Tribune-Review's Colin McNickle questioned Heinz Kerry on what she meant by the term "un-American," according to a tape of the encounter recorded by Pittsburgh television station WTAE.   Heinz Kerry said "I didn't say that" several times to McNickle. She then turned to confer with Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and others. When she faced McNickle again a short time later, he continued to question her, and she replied: "You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."   A spokeswoman for Heinz Kerry later said, "This was sheer frustration aimed at a right-wing rag that has consistently and purposely misrepresented the facts in reporting on Mrs. Kerry and her family."   Vice President Dick Cheney recently came under criticism for using a four-letter obscenity in an exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., on the Senate floor. He later was unapologetic about the remark, saying: "I felt better after I said it."

       Newsday Mary Voboril   Talk about an extreme makeover.  In her slim black slacks, ice blue jacket and bejeweled "Kerry 2004" pin, Teresa Heinz Kerry arrives at the ballroom of the New York Hilton with a certain sexy aplomb, her neckline plunging, her complexion buffed and Botoxed to near perfection.  It's the Jefferson Jackson Dinner, and Heinz Kerry is the keynote speaker for assorted upbeat Democrats - Heinz Kerry, who once trashed politics as "the graveyard of real ideas and the birthplace of empty promises." When some suggested that her first husband, the late Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), should run for president, she had this to say: "Over my dead body." The prospect of becoming a first lady? "Worse than going to a Carmelite convent."  Taking over as Mother Superior in the White House cloister has become a very real prospect for Heinz Kerry, who has long since adapted to the imperatives of a presidential campaign. Here in New York, she tosses back a sweep of Sophia Loren-ish auburn hair and gamely, glamorously holds her grin as news cameras click and whirr, barely blinking as she stares into the truly blinding glare of strobe after strobe after strobe.  Leave it to Teresa: A Democrat for just 18 months, Heinz Kerry - she told a reporter she tacked on "Kerry" for political reasons and that "I don't give a --" what name people use - has been politicking since last year, pounding the New Hampshire pavement ("an awfully cold winter," she recalled in New York), adding 12 pounds to her still-svelte figure ("I have Iowa on one hip and New Hampshire on the other"), addressing such groups as the national convention of the American-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee, trekking to day care centers and hospitals, visiting war veterans and, tomorrow, stepping up to the national microphone as a featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    He calls her 'Sweetie'    "Sweetie," her husband and potential commander in chief calls her, and "my favorite immigrant."  Born to Portuguese parents in the then-Portuguese colony of Mozambique, in East Africa, she sometimes refers to herself as "African-American" and "a daughter of Africa" as well as "Latin." She's famous for her candor: "I'm cheeky, I'm sexy, whatever," Heinz Kerry, who turns 66 on Oct. 5, announced on network television. (She was not available for an interview in time for today's story.)  Tomorrow night, given the stakes, Heinz Kerry possibly will deliver her speech without ad-libs, probably without salty commentary, almost certainly without references to such intensely private matters as prenuptial agreements (yes), Botox (oh, yes), abortion (almost), the possibility of spousal straying (she wouldn't kill, but she would maim) and her emotional attachment to Husband No. 1 ("the love of my life").  The spotlight, after all, is to shine squarely on Husband No. 2, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and the theme is overtly biographic: John Kerry, "A Lifetime of Strength & Service."  There have been lapses, but to some extent, the Heinz Kerry quote machine seems to have been dulled down in recent months, intentionally or not.  "I've wondered whether someone in the campaign sought to tone her down a little bit," says Teresa watcher (it's pronounced Turr-AY-sah) Myra Gutin, who teaches a course on first ladies at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J. "Early on, she talked about Botox and her prenuptial agreement, and now she sticks more to her husband and his abilities.  "I'm sure they wouldn't admit that," Gutin says of any attempt to muzzle her, or at least coach her in the art of self-editing, "but I'd be willing to bet money on it."  So, then: Has anyone tried to tone her down?  "Absolutely not," says a campaign staff member who travels with Heinz Kerry, speaking on condition of anonymity. "And I can't tell you how many people have stopped her while I've been there to say, 'Boy, it's really nice to have someone stand up for what they believe in. It's really nice to have someone who's that genuine.' ... They appreciate a woman who speaks her mind." Also, "she grew up in a dictatorship. Freedom of speech is important to her."    An alpha female    On second thought, who knows what may happen tonight.  As an alpha female - she's a billionaire who runs the billion-dollar-plus Heinz foundations - Heinz Kerry seems to slip her leash, if indeed she has one, with some regularity. Early this month on "60 Minutes," shortly after Kerry announced Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) as his running mate, Heinz Kerry confided that she and Elizabeth Edwards intended to keep their husbands "honest," should the Democratic ticket win the White House.  The meaning was clear - each wife would be a corrective foil for the self-interested sycophants who surround most men in power - but in a political context, the word choice seemed a bit off.  Heinz Kerry later raised eyebrows by touting Edwards as "very beautiful." She and Elizabeth Edwards keep track of such minutiae as schedules, she also said, "because women generally do those things, and the guys just think about big things."  At a Women for Kerry breakfast, she reportedly joked, "We had better get you women some birth control, there are so many of you here!" In April she announced to a gossip columnist, referring to a presidential campaign, "I never wanted to do this. It all seems so bizarre."  But do it she does.  Speaking at the dinner for New York Democrats, Heinz Kerry allowed herself a small smirk before addressing the matter of faux pas, as some see them. In her small, exotically accented, unprojected voice, Heinz Kerry said, "I have been known to speak my mind and express my opinions - maybe you've heard that."  It's a line in her standard speech. To ripples of light laughter, she continued: "My hope is that at the end of this campaign or one day soon, women who have earned the right to their opinions won't be called opinionated. They'll be called smart or well-informed or straight shooters, just as men are."  It would be difficult, however, to argue credibly that Heinz Kerry is not an opinionated woman who is smart, well-informed and a straight shooter. It's just that she's arriving on the national stage during a transitional era for first ladies. For one thing, Heinz Kerry would be the first to have a full-time job. And while she pays attention to couture, favoring Armani, Chanel and Jimmy Choo, Heinz Kerry fits no Barbie-fied template of a traditional political spouse.  The unrelenting scrutiny so afflicted Kerry's first wife, Julia Thorne, that she wrote about it in each of her two books. Politics, Thorne said, "robbed me of privacy and the right to an autonomous life. ... I had to be on guard, carefully monitoring my behavior and appearance in an effort to avoid 'bad press,' gossip or the loss of votes."  Then along came Teresa, four years after the Kerrys divorced in 1988.  Long possessed of an autonomous life in hands-on, mega- dollar philanthropy, Heinz Kerry "doesn't have to fit any mold. She's not trying to be somebody that she isn't already: a sophisticated woman," says her longtime Pittsburgh friend Elsie Hillman, a retired Republican national committeewoman who hosted a wedding luncheon for the Heinzes in 1966. "She's a very bright lady, very outspoken, and her friends enjoy that," Hillman says. Should she become first lady, it would be "very interesting," Hillman says, laughing. "Nothing will be dull."  Apart from philanthropy, Heinz Kerry has sat on several boards, including that of the Brookings Institution and Environmental Defense. Regardless of what happens on Nov. 2, election day, she intends to continue her philanthropic life. She is, Hillman says, "totally committed to Pittsburgh."    'More unique'    Says Wren Wirth, a friend to Heinz Kerry since 1970, "Everybody's unique. But she is ... more unique." She met Heinz Kerry at a beach house, when both had small children. They bonded instantly, dealing, as Wirth recalls it, with rambunctious kids who were throwing food and eating sand.  Wirth, wife of former Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) didn't immediately know that her new friend had married into serious wealth, Heinz being heir to the R.H. Heinz food fortune. Heinz Kerry, Wirth says, gave off no moneyed aura.  Wirth says, "I thought of her then as I think of her now: Remarkably forthright, spontaneous, charming, delightful, very down to earth, very practical, great sense of humor. A breath of fresh air."  One of three children, Heinz Kerry was born to a well-to-do Catholic oncologist. She sometimes went on rounds with him in the still-impoverished nation of Mozambique, dreaming of being a doctor. Reality intruded; in those days there were few female physicians.  Heinz Kerry was graduated from the University of Witwaterswand in South Africa, where she majored in Romance languages and marched against apartheid. She went to interpreters' school at the University of Geneva, and it was in Switzerland that she met Heinz.  Fluent in English, Portuguese, Spanish, French and Italian, Heinz Kerry briefly worked as an interpreter in the United Nations and, at 31, she became a naturalized citizen. (If Kerry is elected, she would be the nation's second foreign- born first lady. The first was Louisa Adams, born in London and the wife of John Quincy Adams.)  The Heinzes were the parents of three sons, two of whom are campaigning for Kerry: Chris, 31, a Yale and Harvard Business grad who left his job at a private equity firm in New York to work in his stepfather's campaign; and Andre, 34, who has worked as an environmental consultant in Stockholm.  H. John IV, 37, is father to Heinz Kerry's only grandchild, a girl, 4. A convert to Buddhism, John IV is a blacksmith who runs an alternative school in Pennsylvania.  It was Heinz, a moderate Republican, who introduced his wife to Kerry in 1990 when the two senators spoke on the steps of the U.S. Capitol for Earth Day.    First husband's death    Heinz died in a 1991 plane crash. His widow and Kerry reconnected in Rio De Janeiro in 1992 at an Earth Day Summit. Heinz Kerry had been sent there as a delegate by then-President George Herbert Walker Bush.  Kerry is five years her junior. In Brazil, Kerry impressed Heinz Kerry by, among other things, speaking to her in French and by taking her to Mass, where he sang hymns in Portuguese. After living together for several months, they married in 1995.  Kerry acquired a high-wattage wife who tends to stand out in a crowd. She may claim to be shy and to have lacked confidence before the primaries, but, according to Wirth, she is possessed of a kind of fill-the-room presence that even has an effect on ambient noise.  "I've seen her do it in a great big room. Even with a lot of people, all of a sudden everything quiets down to her ... " - Wirth pauses to find the right word - "... to her amp. She speaks at certain decibels, in certain tones, and the audience quiets down to meet her."  With more than three months until election day, her precise effect on the electorate is difficult to gauge.  In general, spouses have little substantive impact on voting behavior, exit polls show, though in 1976 some voters wore campaign buttons that said, "I'm voting for Betty's husband," referring to Betty and Gerald Ford. And, famously, some voters had an almost visceral reaction to Hillary Rodham Clinton.  "I don't think Mrs. Kerry - or Mrs. Heinz, as she really is - has yet captured the attention of the public anything like Hillary Clinton in 1992," says Lewis Gould, retired professor of American history at the University of Texas-Austin. Like Gutin, Gould taught a course on first ladies.  With Heinz Kerry, Gould continues, "There have been some blips along the way, but it has not reached firestorm proportions the way it did back then."  (During the primaries Heinz Kerry sometimes fed reporters home-baked brownies.)  Does Gould also think she's toned down her freelance commentary?  "Oh, yeah," Gould says. "She's a fast learner. You don't have to tell her anything twice.  "She's sort of integrated her personality into the demands of the campaign. Remember, she has been the wife of a politician most of her adult life. ... She knows how the game is played, and she's playing it very well."  Heinz Kerry, Gould continues, has largely embraced what he calls the "mindlessness" of campaigns. "You've got to have a stereotypical five or six sentences and keep repeating that until, I suppose, your mind turns to jelly. ... If you freelance at all, you cause more problems than you solve. Because if controversy is generated, it's debilitating: It takes you off message."  And detractors are at the ready. Heinz Kerry, they variously said, "makes Hillary look like a teddy bear" (Floyd Brown, executive director of Young America's Foundation and a board member of Citizens United, two conservative groups.) She is the "bag lady for the radical left" (Ben Johnson, Front PageMagazine.com. Heinz Kerry and her husband? "Cash & Kerry," though Kerry's family also was well-to-do. Radio's Don Imus wondered whether she was "too crazy to be first lady."  It is somewhat ironic that Republicans would trash Heinz Kerry to this extent, however, since she was so closely allied with them for 33 years, switching affiliations in January 2003. That allowed Heinz Kerry to vote for her husband in the Pennsylvania primary, though she also criticized the Republican Party for its conservative drift.  At the Jefferson Jackson dinner, she said the moderate Sen. Heinz probably would have supported Kerry. At other times, she also has said she was appalled at the brutally negative campaign against former Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.). As some Democrats thought, Cleland's opponent, Saxby Chambliss, impugned his patriotism. Cleland is a Vietnam veteran whose war wounds left him a triple amputee.  As for the issue of great wealth, Republicans "never criticized my late husband for his money," Heinz Kerry said on "60 Minutes." "In fact, they used it - and his money was just dandy."  In 1992, Heinz Kerry herself, listing her occupation as "homemaker," gave $5,000 to the Republican Federal Committee of Pennsylvania and $1,000 to the campaign of Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) In 1990, the Heinzes gave $5,250 to the Republican Committee of Pennsylvania.    GOP asked her to run    After Heinz died, Republicans thought enough of her to lobby her to run for his Senate seat. The Howard Heinz and Vira I. Heinz Endowments needed a guiding family hand, and Heinz had been an only child. With the youngest of their sons in high school, Teresa Heinz decided to step in. She still runs the endowments, along with a third foundation, Heinz Family Philanthropies. According to a study by the Los Angeles Times, a 1995 SEC filing shows she also controlled 10 family trusts.  The charities focus on the environment, cultural groups, education and economic development, mostly around Pittsburgh, home to the H.J. Heinz Co. Pittsburgh's Democratic mayor, Tom Murphy, calls her "Saint Teresa."  The Los Angeles newspaper also concluded that Heinz Kerry, who remains a legal resident of Pennsylvania and who owns five homes - including a 23-room Georgetown town house - controls a family fortune worth about $1 billion, double most estimates. In 2003 alone, she earned $5.1 million, the paper said.  "I remember one columnist going after her for the fact that John Kerry seemed to be benefiting from having married this rich widow, which I find amusing," says Carl Sferrazza Anthony, author of the 1990 nonfiction book "First Ladies."  And why is that amusing?  "Because that's the whole story of George Washington," Anthony says. "He married the wealthiest widow in the colony of Virginia. And it permitted him to have his public career, essentially."    Nothing wrong with candor    Anthony also sees nothing wrong in Heinz Kerry's candor - in a "20/20" Barbara Walters interview and elsewhere - about the fact that in 1973, acting on medical advice, she scheduled an abortion while pregnant with a seriously deformed fetus. She miscarried before the procedure was to take place.  "That has not become the headline-grabbing, controversial issue that it might have, had it been discovered later in the summer" and had been exposed as breaking news, Anthony says. "That disclosure up front in many ways disposed of it."  Given a lifetime of wealth and privilege, and given the fact that her public persona can come across, to some, as a bit prickly and temperamental, Heinz Kerry has been called a diva.  But in nearly 40 years, her friend Hillman, for one, has never seen it. "And I didn't get that impression at all," concurs Agnes Varis, a locally prominent Democrat who was seated next to Heinz Kerry at the Jefferson Jackson Dinner.  "She was the exact opposite: Intelligent, warm, cultured. We talked about the Metropolitan Opera - I'm on the board, and she's a personal friend of Beverly Sills."  Far from being Teresa-centric, Heinz Kerry chatted about such things as the need to make opera accessible to a broader audience.  This was no self-adoring attention queen.  "She was so polite," Varis says. "Nice."

       Pittsburgh Post-Gazette James O'Toole   The highlight of the Pennsylvania delegation's weekend in Boston was a welcoming fete under the golden dome of the Massachusetts State House; its star attraction was the state's chief convention luminary, Teresa Heinz Kerry.  Speaking from a staircase just off the capitol rotunda, Heinz Kerry told the crowd that her time was limited because she had to head off to practice the speech she will give from the convention podium tomorrow evening. While she assured them that she had written the speech herself, the outspoken Heinz Kerry said she wasn't used to reading from a TelePrompter.  "As you know, I'm generally unscripted," she said, eliciting knowing chuckles from the crowd.  A few moments later, she offered a perfect example.  As she greeted delegates and well-wishers on her way out of the capitol building, she engaged in a running discussion with Colin McNickle, editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, who repeatedly pressed her on what she had meant during her remarks when she decried "some of the creeping unPennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics."  Heinz Kerry repeatedly insisted that McNickle had mischaracterized her remarks in his questions. After walking away momentarily, she returned to the writer and said, "You're from the Tribune-Review -- understandable. You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."  Asked about the exchange later, McNickel said, "Mrs. Heinz Kerry has a perfect right to say whatever she wants."  In keeping with its attitude toward most Democrats, the Tribune-Review's editorial page have been generally critical of the Kerry campaign. The newpaper's publisher, Richard Mellon Scaife, is a longtime contributor to conservative causes, among them, the Capitol Research Center, a right-wing think tank that has been critical of some of the philanthropic activity of the Heinz family charities guided by Heinz Kerry.  As the Pennsylvania delegates filed into the venerable capitol building, they met reminders of distant and recent history. Bowing to the omnipresent concern about a possible terrorist attack, they were subjected to the strict security checks met at almost every turn in convention environs. The beeps of the magnetometers were accompanied by the strains by a fife and drum trio in authentic revolutionary garb.  If Teresa Heinz Kerry glances to her right when she speaks from the convention podium tomorrow night, she won't have any trouble spotting some of the same Pennsylvanians who cheered her last night. During convention business, the Pennsylvania delegates will be assembled in one of the prime locations in the front of the hall, just below one of the two speakers' stands. Their rows of lightly padded folding chairs are just behind those of Sen. John Edwards' North Carolina delegation and beside those of the New Mexico contingent.  (  urlLink ...  )

       AP Peter Jackson   Teresa Heinz Kerry on Sunday urged her home-state delegates to the Democratic National Convention to help elect her husband president and restore a more civil tone to American politics.  "I need your support. We need to do well in Pennsylvania," she told her fellow Pennsylvanians at a reception at the Massachusetts Statehouse. "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics."  The Pennsylvania delegation was the first to be visited by the wife of presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry, and she said she cherishes her Pittsburgh home because it represents "my American roots." The daughter of a Portuguese physician, Heinz Kerry was born in Africa.  Heinz Kerry criticized the tenor of modern political campaigns, without being specific.  "I remember a time when people in political parties in Pennsylvania talked to one another and actually got things done," said Heinz Kerry, whose first husband, Republican Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, was killed in a plane crash in 1991. "We have to go back to those days when we can do things properly, for the people need it."  "My prayers for you, for me, for the country, for the world, are that we keep this at a high level, with dignity, with respect and with a great idealism and courage that took our forefathers to build this great nation," she said.  Also Sunday, Heinz Kerry acknowledged being nervous about her scheduled Tuesday night speech.  She said she had to practice "a speech that is written on the TelePrompTers, and I'm kind of dreading it, because I am generally unscripted."  Pennsylvania's delegation to the Democratic National Convention revived plans to attend the city-sponsored reception at the Massachusetts capitol only hours before Heinz Kerry's appearance, after the threat of union picketing by local police and firefighters faded away.  Previously, to avoid conflicts with protests by the city police and firefighter unions, state party leaders made plans to hold an alternate reception at the delegation's hotel. But they canceled the hotel event after the firefighters reached a contract accord Sunday.

       San Francisco Chronicle Carla Marinucci    When Elizabeth Edwards sat down with influential and politically minded insiders in San Francisco earlier this year, she demonstrated why she may be a secret weapon for the Democratic presidential ticket of John Kerry and her husband, vice presidential candidate John Edwards.   Instead of the usual niceties about weather, the lunch menu, and her trip, she got down to business with a table of skeptical party activists at the Ritz Carlton Hotel -- and spoke frankly.   "I want to hear from you about any reservations you would have that would keep you from supporting John Edwards,'' she said, looking around at each of the Democratic activists.   She listened to them one by one, and using her skills as a persuasive attorney, answered the criticisms point for detailed point.   "She engaged you, immediately, on the tough stuff," said Martha Whetstone, executive director of the Bar Association of San Francisco. "She invited the tough questioning ... and she was one of the most impressive political people I've ever met,'' said Whetstone, a longtime friend of another famed political spouse, Hillary Rodham Clinton.   Moments such as that one in San Francisco, many of them out of the public eye, may underscore why Elizabeth Edwards, 55, and Teresa Heinz Kerry, 65 -- wife of John Kerry -- have the potential to put their own imprint on the 2004 election.   "They don't directly draw votes, but they do frame the candidates," Barbara O'Connor, professor of political communication at California State University Sacramento, said of political spouses. As in the case of Maria Shriver, a mother of four and a newswoman who served to humanize her sometimes larger-than-life husband, voters look to wives to help "make conclusions about (the candidates) choices in women.''   "There's a transference,'' she said. "If you really like the wives, you transfer that to the candidate.''   With the 2004 Democratic National Convention set to open in Boston on Monday, both Elizabeth Edwards and Teresa Heinz Kerry move from the edges of the campaigns into the center ring, increasing the focus of attention, and criticism, as they prepare for their official introduction to millions of Americans.   For both women, the magnifying glass will provide an ever-more-intimate focus on the personal -- their age, their weight, their dress -- as well as the political, which may be tied to their views on subjects ranging from abortion to the environment.   But already, some Democrats say, these are two women who have proved they have the gumption to take the pressure and go toe-to-toe with their GOP counterparts, first lady Laura Bush and Lynn Cheney.   "A guy who marries a woman that's tough and smart, it says something about their confidence,'' says Garry South, the former senior adviser to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, whose warm and friendly wife, Sharon, was considered a humanizing asset to her staid husband. "Kerry and Edwards didn't have to marry a frumpy librarian from Midland, Texas, to feel like somebody.''   The biting comment about the first lady, widely seen as serene, secure and unflappable in her role, dramatizes the harshly critical arena in which political spouses operate.   Already, Heinz Kerry has felt the sting of criticism, even from more liberal media sources. They have commented on her attitude about her late husband, the Republican Sen. John Heinz (too fawning), her frank admissions (Botox treatments) and her demeanor on stage (too distant). The mother of three, who was born in Mozambique and raised in South Africa, has been alternately described as languid, laid-back and sexy or jarring, blunt and eccentric in style.   Heinz Kerry, whose personal worth is around $1 billion, has earned nicknames like "Terry Kerry, the Pickle Queen'' from conservatives like Melanie Morgan, the San Francisco-based KSFO 560 talk show host. Morgan has said that the candidate's wife has espoused radical environmental organizations through her management of the Heinz Foundation.   Heinz Kerry has become so much of a lightning rod that GOP conservatives in the Central Valley, concerned that they are adding to the Heinz fortune with every french fry, have developed a new brand, "W" ketchup, with the motto "You don't support Democrats. Why should your ketchup?''   (The H.J. Heinz Co., in response, told the Stockton Record that their tomatoes are nonpartisan, and their ketchup "rises above politics.")   But Whetstone says Heinz Kerry understands that in politics there are two options on the spouse's choice of a political profile: to be "superficial and do the beauty queen wave'' or be "independent and have a real life and real interests."   "(Heinz Kerry) has a very different cultural base, and she obviously is not an appendage of her husband,'' she says.   When it comes to winning admirers and winning over critics, Heinz Kerry may have tough competition in her counterpart, Elizabeth Edwards.   A mother of four and an attorney -- no trophy wife, admirers say -- Edwards has won universal raves from Democrats who say she has the perfect mix of smarts, savvy and sincerity. Her compelling life story, which includes the tragedy of her son's death at 16 and her decision to start a new family at 48, has only enhanced her profile.   "Talk about a down-to-earth, bright person,'' says Democratic powerhouse attorney Joe Cotchett, whose wife, Victoria, has hosted both political spouses during stops in the Bay Area. "She is off the charts,'' he says. "She was a great lawyer in her own right. She gives back to the community'' by spearheading a nonprofit foundation that has helped thousands. "I've sat at the table with her and John, and she can dominate the conversation.''   Roger Salazar, a former spokesman for Edwards, says the candidate's wife is "an amazing woman'' who could tackle the toughest campaign schedule. "I spent time with her ... and she would get off a plane from the East and do events all evening without a rest,'' he said. "She's smart, and as well-read and well-informed a person as I've ever met. She and he complement each other well.''   And "complement" may be the operative word.   Heinz Kerry, on "60 Minutes" was keenly on target when she talked about the role she has taken on as her husband and his running mate become the official Democratic nominees.   "Keeping him honest, strong, up when they knock him, and real humble when they praise him too much,'' she said. "And you know Washington. They always do that. You know, you're either a devil or you're a saint, and we -- none of us are either, or most of us are not."

       News Wise   Teresa Heinz Kerry will grab the spotlight with her husband -- Democratic presidential nominee Senator John Kerry -- at the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Boston. That's a good thing, according to one of the nation's leading first lady expert, who believes the perceived "exotic" first lady candidate is "still somewhat of an unknown quantity."   Dr. Myra Gutin is a professor of communications at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., and author of the book The President’s Partner: The First Lady in the 20th Century. Presently working on a biography of former first lady Barbara Bush, Gutin has taught a course on first ladies at Rider for some 20 years. She wishes she had a better sense of Ms. Heinz Kerry -- and maybe will after seeing her at the convention.  Gutin agrees that the Democratic candidate's wife is being viewed as "pretty exotic" -- having grown up in Mozambique, with a father who was a doctor. But she believes that she also seems fairly down to earth -- with some issues that may play as well in the "heartland" as they do with voters in the Northeast.   "She's been involved in a number of issues people can relate to -- particularly education and health. I think that should play very well in the heartland," Gutin says. "They'll (people in the heartland) probably look at her as a little exotic."  If she would become first lady, Heinz Kerry would also be just the second foreign born first lady, according to Gutin -- with the other being Louisa Adams, who was born in London, England.   "To the best of my knowledge, they would be the only two (foreign-born first ladies, should John Kerry get elected). She (Heinz Kerry) does have a slight accent," says Gutin. "She also speaks five languages and controls a couple billion dollars."  It also appears as if the senator's wife is settling into her role on the presidential campaign trail, according to Gutin.  "A few months ago, a reporter for The Dallas Morning News said that they had seen Teresa giving a speech in front of a large group, and then spoke to a small group, and they thought she was so much better with a small group -- being warmer, more animated and outgoing. I have the feeling that she's gotten more comfortable on the national stage since her husband has been running on the national campaign trail," she says, "Even though she's a veteran of senate campaigns with late Senator Heinz, they're nothing like a national presidential campaign. It magnifies any mistake -- like when she pulled John Edwards' son's finger out of his mouth during the first event between the Kerrys' and Edwards'. It's that kind of thing that gets all magnified and blown out of proportion. That's the reality of a national campaign. If there's one thing she's really got to watch, it's the propensity to be honest and shoot from the hip and fall in these places where you're part of the news cycle for a couple of days."  As far as what kind of first lady she'd be, Gutin sees her closer to a Hillary Clinton than a Laura Bush.  "I know that she said that she didn't think it was fair that we thrust presidential spouses into categories, but I think she would be a very active first lady," Gutin says. "She comes from a background that's had her involved in a variety things with late Senator Heinz in the Senate, and now Kerry. She's also been involved with the Heinz Foundation. I would expect her to declare her area of interest and concern -- something she would pursue if she got to the White House.   "Mrs. Bush is a shier person I think, and not likely to cross over in the area of public policy. I could see Mrs. Heinz Kerry possibly doing that, and she's more active."  Gutin also isn't sure that the Republican Party really knows what to do with Heinz Kerry.   "She was married to a popular moderate Republican. So far, they've (the GOP) tried to restrain themselves a little bit. It's like the situation that she was OK when she was a Republican, but now she's a Democrat. How do you portrait her?," she says. "You can't damn her too much, unless you're ready to say that she's really gone over to 'the dark side.' There may be some risk in that."  Regardless of how Heinz Kerry is portrayed, Gutin points out that first lady candidates only have minimal effect of the eventual outcome of a presidential election anyway.  "It's not like the entire decision (of the presidential election) is based on the potential first lady. It isn't. Does it have an effect? Of course it does," says Gutin. "We make some decisions based on the candidate's character, based on their spouse. But when people get in the voting booth, it's not about Laura Bush or Teresa Heinz Kerry."

       Boston Herald Noelle Straub   Teresa Heinz Kerry says her Tuesday speech at the Democratic National Convention will run less than 20 minutes and largely stick to the familiar themes she hits on the stump for her husband.         Heinz Kerry told reporters aboard the campaign plane that she practiced the speech using TelePrompTers last weekend while in Nantucket. She did not deliver it in front of her husband, presumptive nominee Sen. John F. Kerry, but he read the text.         She added the Bay State senator has read his work-in-progress to her as he prepares for one of the biggest speeches of his career.         The potential first lady said her speech runs 13 to 14 minutes, without accounting for applause. She noted former President Clinton will have 45 minutes for his address.         Carrying a coffee cup and sporting sunglasses, Heinz Kerry said she will wear a white or cream-colored skirt instead of one of her usual pantsuits and that Elizabeth Edwards will sport ``soft colors.''         She spoke while awaiting lift-off from Denver an hour and a half behind schedule for a campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa.         When campaigning for her husband, Heinz Kerry almost always speaks about her background growing up in Mozambique, a dictatorship, and not seeing her father vote until he was 71 years old, giving her an appreciation for democracy.         She also typically notes she marched against apartheid in South Africa. She emphasizes educational and environmental issues, talks about improving children's lives and often focuses on the lack of affordable health care.         But in keeping with the campaign's new emphasis on optimism, Heinz Kerry may jettison some of the attacks on President Bush she often includes in speeches.         Yesterday at a rally here on the banks of the Missouri River, Heinz Kerry took several such shots, saying that unlike the president, her husband enjoys history and ``actually reads.''

       The New York Times Jodi Wilgoren   The speech won’t last long, maybe 20 minutes including all the applause. She will wear a skirt, probably white or ivory, rather than the pantsuits she favors on the campaign trail.   And Teresa Heinz Kerry has already started rehearsing on the TelePrompTer, a device she has never before used, in anticipation for the biggest public appearance of her life, on Tuesday evening at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    Speaking to reporters aboard her husband’s chartered campaign plane before it took off from Denver for the flight here Saturday morning, Mrs. Heinz Kerry said her convention speech would likely touch the same themes she has been talking about for months, with some new material. One of her aides said the speech would be missing the protein of a red-meat missive, and was framed more as a conversation with both the people in the hall and the television audience, particularly the women among them.   After practicing with the prompter – one with two screens, not the three she will likely have at Boston’s Fleet Center -- last weekend on Nantucket island in Massachusetts, Mrs. Heinz Kerry said she is not nervous about reading the electronic text because “it’s my language,” meaning she had written the words herself. She said she had not rehearsed the speech in front of her husband, Senator John Kerry, the Democrats’ nominee-to-be, but that he had read the text.   Mrs. Heinz Kerry said Mr. Kerry had practiced his speech for her – but that, as is his habit, he is still very much in the midst of writing and rewriting and rewriting.   She left here after a rally Saturday afternoon bound for Boston, four days ahead of her husband, to continue speech prep and attend events in and around the convention. On Monday night, she is expected to watch President Clinton speak from the family box in the Fleet Center, and on Tuesday, she will be feted at a private luncheon, thrown by Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s wife, Vicki, at the Museum of Fine Arts.  On Wednesday, she plans to drop by a huge reception, at the chic restaurant Mistral, thrown by Bob Crowe, a Boston developer who has been a prolific Kerry fundraiser, and then to return to the family box to watch Senator John Edwards of North Carolina accept the vice presidential nomination. And Thursday, she will likely meet with several convention caucuses and speak to the delegation from Pennsylvania, which she still considers her primary residence.   As for clothes, Mrs. Heinz Kerry, who changed from beige knit pants and a white button-down blouse to white cotton capris and beige espadrilles during the flight here, said Tuesday night’s outfit would definitely be a skirt. She also said Mr. Edwards’ wife, Elizabeth, would wear “soft colors” so the two would not clash. Marla Romash, Mrs. Heinz Kerry’s spokeswoman, told reporters they would have to just wait and see.  “I’ll know more about that once we get to Boston and I look in her closet,” Ms. Romash explained. “Because I’m the one who’s going to say, ‘Can you raise your arms in that suit?’”

       AP   Hailed by Senator Ted Kennedy as the Democratic party's "secret weapon," Teresa Heinz Kerry has been a fixture in her husband John Kerry's election campaign, infusing it with her spontaneity and originality.   Heiress to the Heinz ketchup and soup fortune, the 65-year-old Heinz Kerry has been immersed in the Massachussett senator's quest for the White House, attending numerous election rallies, either on her own or by her husband's side.   Born in Mozambique and brought up in South Africa and Europe, fluent in five languages, when she speaks to immigrants, Heinz Kerry manages to strike a chord by sharing her nostalgia for the homeland.   With women she discusses the difficulties of balancing motherhood -- she has three sons and a year ago became a grandmother -- and a career -- she runs a multi-million dollar charitable foundation -- or the importance of education.   Convinced that her impulsiveness is a welcome counterpoint to Senator Kerry's somewhat dour demeanor, Heinz Kerry often digresses unexpectedly, admitting to Elle magazine last year, for example, that she used Botox, the injected wrinkle eradicator.   Or she improvises on politics as she did last month when she compared Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba with South Africa under apartheid.   Teresa Heinz Kerry was born Teresa Simoes-Ferreira to Portuguese parents. She studied in South Africa and Switzerland before moving to the United States to work for the United Nations.  A registered Democrat since only last year, she was married to Republican senator John Heinz, scion of the Pittsburgh-based Heinz food condiment company, for 25 years. He died in a plane crash in 1991.   Heinz Kerry does not mince words when speaking about the current Republican president.   "I am very angry at the president and his economic policies," she has said. "It's not just, it's not fair, it's not American. The American people are not unfair."   As for Bush's tax cut, which Democrats say helps the rich more than the average American, Heinz Kerry said "it benefited me, but I don't need it or deserve it."   Heinz Kerry usually appears in public in jacket and tailored pants with a shawl around her shoulders. With her chestnut hair often covering her eyes, she affects a natural look which belies her wealthy background.   The Los Angeles Times recently estimated her forture at between 900 million and 3.2 billion dollars.   Since John Heinz's death, Heinz Kerry has headed the Heinz family's charitable foundations -- the Howard Heinz Endowment and the Heinz Family Philanthropies.   She has channelled much of the funds into the defense of the environment and women's rights, including abortion -- topics central to the presidential campaign.   Teresa Heinz and John Kerry met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. She was sent there by former president George Bush.   Kerry, who is five years younger than Teresa Heinz Kerry, divorced his previous wife in 1988. They have two daughters.   Kerry has described his wife as "saucy, sexy and brilliant."   Some have said the marriage has helped Kerry financially.   But Heinz Kerry says that since they married in 1995 the couple have kept their personal accounts separate. Kerry even had to mortgage his half of the Boston family home at one low point to finance his campaign for the Democratic nomination.

       New York Times Katharine Q. Seelye   Two dozen people turned out on Monday to meet Elizabeth Edwards, wife of Senator John Edwards, the apparent Democratic vice-presidential candidate, and they said they were troubled by President Bush. The president, they told Mrs. Edwards, is exploiting the concepts of values and faith. One called him a hypocrite.  Mrs. Edwards did not miss a beat. Tone down the harshness, she said, and do not be "too negative'' and do not use the word "hypocritical.''  "It's not useful, because that kind of language for swing voters - they are tired of partisanship,'' she said. "They don't want to hear how lousy the other guy is. Talk about how your values inform what you are doing.''   Her advice - not to trash the opposition - seemed as unusual for a political spouse as her style was casual. Although the men at the gathering, in a private home, wore suits and ties and the other women wore dresses, Mrs. Edwards wore a red-hooded sweatshirt. With Senator John Kerry's selection of her husband as his running mate, Mrs. Edwards is emerging as a forthright and unpretentious spirit on the hustings, a campaigner who talks freely about coloring the gray out of her hair and struggling with her weight. It is a style that her listeners here praised as a welcome relief from the polished artifice of modern politics.  "She's a real woman,'' said Delainia Davis, 48, a mother of three and grandmother of four and who with her husband, Art, a lawyer, held the event in their book-lined den here. "We're not all Barbie doll size 0,'' Ms. Davis said. "Give me an intelligent, strong woman any day, not that size 0's can't be intelligent, too.''  Another guest, Madeline Rogero, 51, a former county commissioner and mayoral candidate, said: "She's very natural. It's not like she's been handled.''  Of course, Mrs. Edwards is not exactly Everywoman. For one thing, in the four years before her husband joined the Senate in 1999, he made nearly $27 million as a personal injury lawyer, according to his campaign. They own three houses: one in Raleigh, N.C.; a beach house on Figure Eight Island near Wrightsville Beach, N.C.; and a town house in the Georgetown section of Washington that they bought last year for $3.8 million.  Moreover, Mrs. Edwards married a man whom People magazine in 2000 called the sexiest politician alive.  Mrs. Edwards said in an interview in a hotel here over breakfast that she thought that Republicans sometimes emphasized her husband's looks as a way to "diminish" him as a "dumb blond." Still, she spoke approvingly of his being "part of a great communications package.''  "He feels like he's a conduit for a message," she said, "and whatever skills he has that allow that message to get through, that's great.''  Another bit of biography that sets Mrs. Edwards apart is that she became a mother again relatively late in life. Her older son, Wade, died in 1996 in a highway accident when he was 16, and Mrs. Edwards said she and her husband wanted children again to bring joy back into their home. She took hormone shots and gave birth when she was 48 to a daughter, Emma Claire, now 6, and to a son, Jack, now 4, when she was 50.   Their older daughter, Cate, 22, just graduated from Princeton and is to join the Kerry-Edwards campaign before interning at Vanity Fair magazine in New York.  On the trail, Mrs. Edwards is a combination of career woman (she has a master's in English and became a bankruptcy lawyer, obtaining settlements for small-business owners) and stay-at-home mother with exuberant young children. She said, "Sometimes you are mistaken for the grandmother, as opposed to the mother.''  Their son's death is something the Edwardses do not bring up, but it is becoming the portal through which some voters empathize with them.  "They lost a child and still stayed together and created another family,'' said Phyllis Tuchman, 57, a freelance art critic, who watched Mrs. Edwards on Sunday night at the dedication of a chapel at a retreat near here for the Children's Defense Fund.  "I liked that they could make it work,'' Ms. Tuchman added. "That says a lot about them.''  The dedication of the chapel and a dinner afterward for 700 people was Mrs. Edwards's first solo campaign appearance as the wife of the potential vice president. A fast talker anyway, she raced through her typed speech, which was loaded with statistics, and ended saying that there was "nothing more immoral'' than the fact that one of every six children in the United States lives in poverty.  Louise Riggio, 57, sat with Mrs. Edwards at the dinner. Her husband, Leonard, is chairman of Barnes & Noble and was one of two people, with William Lynch, a former deputy mayor of New York, for whom the chapel was named.  "She's so normal,'' Mrs. Riggio said of Mrs. Edwards. She said that during dinner, over plates heaped with fried chicken, pork ribs, beef ribs, macaroni salad, green beans and peach cobbler, Mrs. Edwards told her how hard it was to watch her weight during the campaign.  "She said she put away all her size 10's because she can't get into them and won't be able to until after the campaign,'' Mrs. Riggio said. "It was great to admit something like that. Very human.''  Despite the demands of campaign life, Mrs. Edwards said she relished the campaign itself.  A Navy brat, she was born Mary Elizabeth Anania in Florida, the oldest of three children, and moved constantly - good preparation, she said, for learning how to become comfortable quickly with new people.  She is ambitious for her husband, keenly attuned to what she thinks works for him and what does not. Throughout the Democratic primaries, she advised his campaign on issues large and small. In the interview here, when a photographer started taking her picture, she suggested a different shot.  "Do you mind if I move the food?'' Mrs. Edwards asked in her faintly Southern accent and smiled.   "There was a picture in Esquire of Al Sharpton with his plate in front of him, with the chicken bones,'' she said. "Not good. Your half-empty plate is not a good look.''  She said she was determined to do what she could to help the Democratic ticket, though only things that "translate into votes.''  "I'm willing to listen to anybody,'' she said. "It doesn't mean I'm going to do everything. I'm not a puppet. But I've got ears, and I'm going to use them to make certain I'm doing the best possible things I can do.''  One advice giver has been Tipper Gore, who as Al Gore's wife has plenty of campaign experience.  "Tipper's advice was," Mrs. Edwards said, " 'Don't let it get to you. Just ride the top of the wave.' I had heard that she wouldn't read press clippings. I do. I'll go to the most viciously Republican Web sites and read this stuff, because it just hardens you, it makes you stronger.''  While Mr. Edwards likes to say that he and his wife are "connected at the breastbone,'' she does not bother to paint a picture of rosy harmony. She said that when she met her future husband in law school at the University of North Carolina 30 years ago, they had little in common. And some of those differences persist. "We don't listen to the same music,'' she said. "We don't read the same books.''  Still, she is her husband's closest and most trusted adviser, and collaborating with him will be her central role in the campaign. Although she is passionate about after-school programs and preventative medicine, she said Teresa Heinz Kerry had first dibs on issues to promote.   "I'm sitting second chair,'' Mrs. Edwards said. "So I have to wait and see.''  She said she thought that she could be an effective messenger.  "I come out of a real life,'' she said. "Because I'm 55, I've spent 20 years at PTA meetings and soccer practices, all the kind of things that regular moms do, and I think that makes people feel fairly comfortable with me, which is great. It's just like with John, you want to be a good conduit for the message. And to the extent to which they say this person may share my interests or values because their life is a lot like mine, that's good.''

       ariannaonline.com Arianna Huffington   Teresa Heinz Kerry is a breath of fresh air, so why are the media choking on it?  Almost every story about her these days includes at least one snarky remark – usually attacking her for her refusal to endlessly regurgitate the same pre-approved talking points.  According to the chattering class, Heinz Kerry is – and I quote – "too outspoken," "too opinionated," "slightly zany," "eccentric and unpredictable," "the queen of direct" and – cover your ears, kids – "says what she thinks, when she thinks it."  In other words, she's an unconventional straight shooter. The horror!  (Reporters also seem to have a big problem with her hair, which has variously been described as "unkempt," "unruly," "humidity-frizzed," "voluminous" and "expensively colored a rich auburn" – but that's follicle fodder for another column.)  Even Maureen Dowd, no slouch herself in the independent-thinking department, felt compelled to write not one but two columns in the course of 10 days slamming Teresa for, among other things, being "flaky."  You gotta love this about our media mavens: They are constantly bemoaning the lack of forthrightness in our public figures – the vast majority of whom wouldn't know a straight answer if it bit them in the butt. But when they are finally presented with someone who doesn't (pardon the expression) beat around the bush, they start sharpening the long knives.  They're like a bunch of little kids who have gotten so used to being fed nothing but vanilla ice cream for dessert that a serving of Rocky Road with some sprinkles on top leaves them sputtering and crying, "Yuck!"  Most of the American public, on the other hand, possess a far more developed and discerning palate – and can appreciate more complex and piquant flavors.  And when it comes to spicing up the political dessert tray, Teresa Heinz Kerry is one of the most flavorful and compelling public figures to hit the national stage in decades.  When I first met her in Washington in 1980, she was a very popular Republican wife, with views very similar to the ones she holds today. Now she's a Democratic wife, a philanthropist who oversees a foundation that gives tens of millions to causes like the environment, healthcare and early education, a loving mother, grandmother and stepmother. She grew up in Mozambique, went to college in South Africa where she marched against apartheid, is fluent in five languages and learned so much about medicine from her oncologist father that friends and family have nicknamed her "Dr. T."  And unlike most politicians, she has a natural gift for intimacy and interacts with campaign crowds of 5,000 as if she were sitting around chatting with a small group of friends.  Yes, she is indeed unabashedly open with her opinions on everything from the war in Iraq ("I would never have gone to war this way") to George Bush ("fazed by complexity") to Botox treatments (she's had them).  But isn't that what we claim to want from those in public life? Or are we comfortable with authenticity only when it's a contrivance manufactured to appear authentic?  "I am the product of living in dictatorships," Teresa has said. "It makes you cherish the ability to be yourself, to have feelings and to speak them when asked. People say I'm blunt. I say, 'No, just honest.'"  It's this honesty that has led the media to brand her with the scarlet O for offbeat – a caricature given national credence by a Newsweek cover that trumpeted: "Is John Kerry's Heiress Wife a Loose Cannon or Crazy Like a Fox?"  It was character assassination by headline – especially since the cover line was not in any way reflective of the story inside, which painted Heinz Kerry as warm, smart, alive, funny, and, yes, brutally honest.  It's hard to imagine that headline – which was written, incidentally, by a man – being used to describe a man. As Marlo Thomas once said: "A man has to be Joe McCarthy to be called ruthless. All a woman has to do is put you on hold."  We may have come a long way, baby, but there is no doubt that there is still a double standard when it comes to women in politics – especially political wives – who are supposed to be smart but not so smart that they're threatening, and strong but not so strong that they are intimidating.  It's a high-wire tightrope act, one that's almost impossible to pull off to the political media's satisfaction. And this at a time when girl power is blossoming in other parts of our culture, especially sports and entertainment. Last week's Olympic Trials featured women going faster, higher, stronger than ever before. And our movie screens are filled with indomitable, determined women like "Kill Bill's" Beatrix Kiddo or Keira Knightley's kick-ass Guinevere in the new "King Arthur."  But try to apply these attributes to politics and the media start acting like it's 1958 – they suddenly don't know how to handle smart, accomplished, complex women. Judy Dean wasn't glamorous or supportive enough, Hillary was too smart and too strong and Teresa is too loose-lipped and too unpredictable.  So it really isn't much of a surprise that the political wife the media seem most comfortable with is Laura Bush, who has chosen to take on the image of the perfect 1950s sitcom housewife.  She's the Harriet Nelson of first ladies, the quintessential deferential spouse, praised by her husband for not "trying to butt in and always, you know, compete" and lauded by the media for her ability "to balance strength and subservience." I guess I missed the moment where subservience became a virtue.  When Laura Bush was asked what advice she'd given her twin daughters before sending them out this summer to campaign for their father, she replied: "Stand up straight and keep your hair out of your eyes." Words to live by – if you're Marabel Morgan. Somehow, I don't think those are the same words of wisdom Teresa Heinz Kerry passed on to her stepdaughters before they hit the hustings.  Both Teresa and Laura are scheduled to deliver primetime speeches at their respective party conventions. The contrast between the two – and what this contrast says about the men in their lives – should be stark. Out on the campaign trail, Teresa is given to in-depth discussions about health care and global warming. Laura tends to say things like: "I'm not privy to the policy disputes. I'm not over there at the table where everyone is actually formulating specific policy." Heaven forbid.  "We need to honor women in all their complexity," Teresa Heinz Kerry told me. "It's time that we acknowledge the wisdom women have acquired by managing the chaos of daily life. Women are realists, the glue that holds society together. They bring a reverence to life that's instinctual, not just intellectual."  Thirty-eight million women didn't vote in 2000, many of them because they were so disgusted with our inauthentic politics-as-usual. If even a small percentage of them turn out this November, they could very well end up deciding the election and the direction of the country.  So I propose that we turn on its ear the traditional good-old-boy political litmus test – which candidate would you rather have a beer with? Instead, let's ask the women of America: Which candidate's wife would you rather have a cup of coffee with?

       New York Times Alessandra Stanley   Viewers who missed the Tuesday premiere of a new Fox reality show, "Trading Spouses," can make it up by watching "Washington Wives" on A&E tonight.  This documentary, which follows Teresa Heinz Kerry and Elizabeth Edwards as they campaign for their husbands during the Democratic primaries, is slow-paced, serious and even-handed, everything a reality show abhors, and yet it still manages to pit these two women against each other as foils.   The Iowa and New Hampshire settings may be obsolete, but the film's timing, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Boston, is perfect: next week the wives of John Kerry and John Edwards will be showcased on national television. The documentary can serve as a control against which to measure the hyperbole and omissions in the party's packaging of the nominees' wives. Yet all documentaries, including this one, should come with a warning: the camera does not lie, but film editors punch up the truth. Sometimes it is as evident in well-intentioned news documentaries as it is on an outré reality show like "Trading Spouses."  Mrs. Heinz Kerry's melancholy Anna Magnani manner ("I am just a wife who is interested in the human condition and the world") comes off on camera as pompous and slightly ridiculous, a little like the pampered blond Texas housewife, Tammy Nakamura, who was sent by Fox to live with a low income black family on "Trading Spouses" and complained about the coffee. ("It has to be regular," Tammy proclaims, "not instant.")  In contrast Mrs. Edwards, tirelessly bright and friendly and always eager to turn the subject back to her husband, seems much more comfortable and comforting on the campaign trail. She is the one viewers are set up to root for the Iowa caucus equivalent of Al-Mela Biggins, an out-of-work medical technician who took Tammy's place in the Nakamura family mansion.  Mrs. Edwards never complains, never looks tired or discontented. She is focused on making contact with voters and has a sense of humor. When her 5-year-old, Emma Claire, began acting up on the campaign bus and stuck her tongue out at the camera, Mrs. Edwards smiled apologetically and said, "We didn't raise French children."  In politics, as in reality shows, certain narrative arcs are inevitable: rich, pampered woman are not as likable as their plainer, less privileged counterparts. (Even Jackie Kennedy was widely mocked for her spending and highfalutin taste early in her husband's presidency.)  ABC has its own reality show, "Wife Swap," which it accuses Fox of copying and getting on the air first. (ABC unwisely decided to push back its air date to the fall.) The first episode of "Wife Swap" follows the same story line: pampered rich New York housewife trades places with a down-to-earth rural working mother and is exposed as a complete pain.  The A&E documentary tries very hard to be fair to both Mrs. Heinz Kerry and Mrs. Edwards, but the contrast between them somehow looms larger than any of the other women profiled. Judy Steinberg Dean didn't campaign, so the documentary instead follows Howard Dean's national finance director, Stephanie Schriock.  The Washington writer and hostess Sally Quinn is also interviewed as an expert on Washington wives, and her regal presence (she is filmed at a black-tie function and in the garden of her house in the Hamptons) helps defuse the aura of privilege around Mrs. Heinz Kerry, who is shown only on the campaign trail or in a TV studio. (Mrs. Edwards, however, allowed a camera crew to film the back of her huge Georgetown house.)  Ms. Quinn, who describes how difficult it is to be in the shadow of her husband, Ben Bradlee, expresses pity for candidates' wives but also offers them some pull-up-your-socks advice: "Understand that this is about your husband, and not about you."  Despite decades in Washington Mrs. Heinz Kerry seems to have a hard time remembering that precept when the cameras start to roll. When asked about herself, she replies with vigor and at length. She was born in colonial Mozambique of Portuguese parents, and she tells an African-American television reporter, "The one thing I've inherited from being African-born is that honesty and truth outshine everything else."  A reality show would leave it at that. A&E had the grace to also include a tableau that does not fit the overall impression: a softer moment that did not make many news programs but that is the kind that is likely to be used by convention image makers. At a stop at a school for troubled and autistic children in Concord, N.H., Mrs. Heinz Kerry read a Dr. Seuss book to the children and told them about African and South American snakes. When a child asks whether the Anaconda could eat "one of us?" she replies earnestly, "Two of you."

       AP Connie Cass   At first blush, appearing at the side of a senator husband who borders on glamorous, Elizabeth Edwards seems positively ordinary.      A sleep-deprived but cheerful mom to two small children, she carries a notebook of lyrics for family singalongs; loves to shop the Internet; can chat knowledgeably about the merits of "Teletubbies" vs. "Blue's Clues" or Weight Watchers vs. the South Beach Diet.   Yet Edwards, 55, has led an extraordinary life.   She grew up hopscotching between the United States and Japan, studied the Romantic poets, excelled in law school in an era when few women were admitted. She juggled a successful legal career and family for 19 years. Then — stunned by a terrible loss — she quit work to have more children at an age when many contemporaries were easing toward grandmotherhood.   Along the way, she advised and aided husband John Edwards as he sailed through multimillion-dollar lawsuits to the Senate to presidential ambitions.   "We've always talked about things that we've been doing," she said in an interview, whether courtroom strategies or campaign advertising. "We've always been each other's intellectual equals."   Now, as the wife of the No. 2 man on the Democratic ticket, her down-to-earth appeal and focus on substance over style are a valuable asset for a candidate some opponents dismiss as a handsome lightweight.   Edwards dubbed herself the "anti-Barbie," suggesting her husband is no mere Ken doll, either.   They met in law school. Elizabeth Anania, the daughter of a Navy pilot, had lived in a dozen different Japanese and American cities by the time she was 18. She intended to teach, and pursued a doctorate in English literature at the University of North Carolina. But a tight job market persuaded her to switch to the law school.   There she stood out as worldly, witty and wise for her years, former classmates say.   "She was an absolutely stunning, attractive person, but her real beauty was she was just brilliant," said longtime family friend David Kirby.   John Edwards was just one among a school brimming with young men from small Carolina towns. "I was not actually attracted to him," she recalls bluntly.   When she finally relented to a date, he took her dancing to a loud band at a Holiday Inn. She was unimpressed — until he gave her a gentlemanly goodnight kiss on the forehead.   Goodnight groping was more common in 1975.   "I thought, that was awfully sweet," said Edwards. Gradually it dawned on her that this determined, family oriented, ever-optimistic young man was a real catch.   They were married the Saturday after she passed the bar exam in 1977.   The Edwardses became an '80s power couple in North Carolina. She worked in the state attorney general's office, then practiced bankruptcy law. As his law career took off, Edwards limited her hours to make time for children Wade and Catharine and the PTA, soccer practice and assorted mom duties.   That seems like another lifetime now. Those days were swept away without warning in April 1996, when 16-year-old Wade died in an automobile accident.   Edwards has described the loss of her son as an "A.D./B.C. moment" — a pivotal point, by which everything else is dated and defined.   In her grief, she stopped working, stopped doing much of anything. Even watching TV was too painful. "When you lose a child, life sort of stops for a bit," she said.   She found some solace in founding an after-school computer lab at Wade's high school, where she volunteered every day.   Edwards never returned to lawyering. Instead, she began hormone treatments in hopes of conceiving more children. The couple felt that would be the best way to bring joy back into their home, for themselves and grieving daughter Cate.   By the time her husband waged his Senate campaign, Edwards was expecting Emma Claire, now 6 years old. She was 50 when she gave birth to Jack, now 4. Cate, 22, graduated from Princeton this year with a degree in political economics.   Between pregnancy and newborn care, Edwards couldn't get out much for that 1998 race. But from the start of primary season, the presidential campaign has been a family project.   Edwards speaks up for her husband when he can't be at meetings and keeps an eye on scheduling to ensure there will be family time. All three children make campaign appearances.   "People will always say to me, isn't this hard on you and hard on your family? And it's not really," she said. "We're a strong family."

       AP Jennifer Peter   On the national stage for nearly a year, Teresa Heinz Kerry has refused to play by the usual script.  "I'm not going to be anyone's puppet," Heinz Kerry, 65, said in an interview with The Associated Press. "If I was scripted, I couldn't do it."  There have been few plastic smiles, no fawning gazes at her husband, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. When he grips her too tightly, she winces. If she doesn't think a joke is funny, she doesn't laugh. If someone asks a potentially embarrassing question - about Botox or their prenuptial agreement - she answers, regardless of the headlines she might create.  "If you're a staffer on the Kerry campaign, you listen to her and you gotta wonder every time she gets up what she's going to say," said Terry Madonna, a public policy professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. "To many people, her candor is refreshing but also unpredictable."  Little about Heinz Kerry's life story has been predictable, from her birth to Portuguese parents in an East African dictatorship to her emergence as one of the richest women in America following the death of her first husband, Republican Sen. John Heinz III of Pennsylvania, in 1991.  "I'm a human being like everybody else," Heinz Kerry said. "I feel pain. I've had my ups and downs like everybody. I've had my sadnesses."  John Heinz, heir to the ketchup fortune, introduced his wife to Kerry during a 1990 Earth Day press conference in Washington. Two years later, after Heinz's death in a helicopter crash, Kerry was seated next to Teresa Heinz at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit.  In 1995, they exchanged vows as his two daughters from a previous marriage and her three sons looked on. Yet it wasn't until the elections of 2002, when the GOP questioned the patriotism of Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia, who lost three limbs in Vietnam, that she joined her husband's political party.  "When have we had a candidate's wife who had been in the opposite party? Who has all that money? And who has that rather exotic background?" asked Myra Gutin, a historian of first ladies from Rider University. "She is never going to be the typical candidate's wife."  That, according to her friends and old warriors from the Heinz Senate campaigns, is her strength - and a resource the Kerry campaign should be eager to tap. They describe her as a fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person who has an unswerving loyalty to her own sense of self, even when it would be politically expedient to act like someone else.  "Voters out there think that politicians are all alike, that they don't tell the truth, that they don't say what they think. Teresa is a breath of fresh air and that's what this country needs," said Wren Wirth, one of Heinz Kerry's closest friends and the wife of former Sen. Tim Wirth of Colorado.  While many define Heinz Kerry by her enormous wealth - "They see me as a dollar sign," she says - her roots are more modest. She grew up in Mozambique, the daughter of an oncologist of comfortable means.  She studied at a South African university, honing her fluency in five languages - Italian, French and Spanish besides English and her native Portuguese - which she sometimes whips out on the campaign trail. She met her first husband while studying at an interpreters school in Switzerland.  Heinz Kerry is said to be worth $500 million or more, and she owns five homes. Still, friends and campaign observers say, she has an ability to connect to voters whose lives are quite different from hers.  "She really talked to me as a person," a Kerry supporter, Barbara Adams, 69, of Darien, Conn., said after a recent luncheon fund-raiser in Boston. "What she said seemed to come right from the soul."  After Heinz's death, she was pressured to run for his seat. Instead, she decided to become the chairwoman of The Howard Heinz Endowment and the Heinz Family Philanthropies, helping to steer investments to the arts, the environment, education, children and health care.  On the campaign trail, Heinz Kerry does not always appear comfortable in the spotlight. Friends say she never has.  "I think she likes the politics that is the arena of ideas," said Larry McCarthy, a GOP media consultant and longtime press secretary to John Heinz, "but I think she could very happily dispense with the campaign element of that."  Republicans speculate that Heinz Kerry's candid moments, when she talks openly about her personal and political beliefs, could clash with her husband's more measured approach.  "The biggest danger for Kerry is that his stances on issues are so carefully calibrated that she might speak the truth and mess up the very carefully scripted way Kerry is hoping voters perceive the issue," said Massachusetts Republican consultant Rob Gray. "The more outspoken she is, the more she could end up contradicting him."  Heinz Kerry's youngest son argues, however, that his mother's candor complements his stepfather's style.  "I think some people think John is too scripted," said Chris Heinz, 31, "so in that way, they balance each other."  For a strong woman, Heinz Kerry is soft-spoken, her accented voice strained by stump speeches and the one-on-one conversations she says she so enjoys in the small towns of America. At a recent women's luncheon, she spoke of the need to revive America's "can-do" attitude, of the 20 pounds she's gained on the trail, of the "young man" she married nine years ago.  "I had initial doubts about my ability to be a good partner in this campaign. Whether or not I would hurt, whether or not I would help," she said. "I didn't think I could stay focused, disciplined, strong enough. But I did it."

       Community Times Deborah Mathis    How about that Teresa Heinz Kerry, huh? "Cheeky," she called herself. And "sexy." With "a lot of life inside me."  Thank heavens. It's about time the Stepfords took a hike and let a real woman in the White House.  A woman of not only independent means - and how! - but of independent spirit. What a relief it would be to have a woman in the East Wing who is sovereign, colorful and disinclined to bask in the reflected glory of her very significant other.  It's an interesting coincidence that we are presented this option just when the country is sighing over the example of Nancy Reagan, who patented the Adoring Gaze, which she cast invariably upon her husband with, as we are all now persuaded to believe, heartfelt devotion.  Every first lady since Mrs. Reagan has had her version of the Gaze, though Barbara Bush's seemed more smug than adoring and Hillary Clinton trumped hers with a famous UnGaze during her family's untimely vacation to Martha's Vineyard in 1998, which commenced on the very day that the president admitted, under oath, to an affair with a White House intern.  She may have been the first to conjure up daggers by looking away from her husband's face.  Heinz Kerry has been caught looking at her husband lovingly as he spoke or took questions. But she does not melt into him. That is, I imagine, because she's got his number. She knows what she knows of him in that most private and intimate way that only wives can. She doesn't appear awed by her husband.  He does what she knew he would. Her gaze says, I am proud but not amused. There have been attempts to challenge Ms. Heinz Kerry's fitness for first ladydom by virtue of her vast wealth, an estimated $500 million.  But there is precedence for that. The country's very first first lady was a wealthy woman who, like Heinz Kerry, became so by dent of widowhood.  Col. Daniel Park Custis, Martha Washington's first husband, left his wife with four young children and a treasure that included a Virginia mansion they called, interestingly, "White House."  I don't get the feeling that Teresa Kerry's financial or spiritual independence will make her difficult to digest. To the contrary, I foresee a woman who will become an advocate for issues she earnestly believes in, not borrow an agenda from the first ladies' shelf, like a beauty queen with a one-year tour of duty.  And although Laura Bush is pleasant enough, she has helped perpetuate the reputation of first ladies as an extension or appendage of the man in the Oval Office.  In her feisty, comfortable-in-my-own-skin, mind-of-my-own way, Teresa Kerry could revise the script and prove to men and women alike that it is possible to be both a devoted spouse and an individual.  And sexy? How long has it been since that kind of heat emanated from the White House? Teresa Kerry is 65. As a classy but redoubtably sensual woman, she can do for women of a certain age what Viagra has done for aging men.  Just by declaring herself sexy, she breathes life into the notion that family values and protecting the sanctity of marriage involve more than soccer matches and constitutional amendments.  Oh, bring her on and quickly.  Some of us are so tired of the fakery of perfectionism. The perfect designer suit and the perfect wave, the perfect smile and the perfect word, the perfect table setting and the perfect hairdo. There is so much more to women than photo ops and exclusive sit-downs with Barbara Walters.  Most first ladies have been women of substance, yet most have been content to hide their lights under a bushel. Teresa Heinz Kerry strikes me as a woman who wants to let her light shine, but only when it's natural light, not a cold, fluorescent glow.  It's a new millennium. for heaven's sake. Isn't it time for first lady liberation?

       Boston Herald Andrew Miga and David R. Guarino   On a damp May night on Nantucket nine years ago, John F. Kerry and Teresa Heinz exchanged wedding vows in a small civil ceremony at Heinz's oceanfront home.         The lanky senator's new bride was one of the world's leading philanthropists, beneficiary to a ketchup fortune estimated at beyond $500 million.         The senator's net worth on his wedding day was about $150,000, according to a former aide.         It was a lopsided union - at least financially.         But old friends and political pals say the marriage gave Kerry more than just financial stability. It gave him personal stability, mellowing the hard-charging Bay State senator and lending an emotional ballast to the free-wheeling style Kerry had picked up since he returned to bachelorhood 13 years before.         Kerry's days of philandering with starlets were over.         But also banished were the years of tight finances, hitting up real estate barons for cut-rate apartments and sweating rent checks to maintain residences in Boston and Washington.         Teresa Heinz - she didn't take the senator's name until it was on a presidential primary ballot - was earthy, outspoken and passionate about environmentalism and public health.         She wore an easy sophistication, a North African by birth who was devoted to using her wealth as a means to make the world a better place.         She immediately countered Kerry's cool, aloof persona.         ``When you live with someone, you adapt,'' Heinz Kerry told The New York Times this year. ``With my late husband, we were both kids, young, so you grow up together.         ``With John, there were two adults. I had my baggage, my wounds, my hurts, he had his. The only difference is I came from having been married a long time, 25 years successfully married, and John had been 12 years alone. He had to learn how to share some things which he probably never thought he had to share.''         The wealth Kerry married into was mind-boggling - even for someone born into privilege as a distant Forbes family relation.         Today, Kerry and his wife own five opulent homes - in Idaho, Beacon Hill, Georgetown, Nantucket and Fox Chapel, Pa. - worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $33 million.         Teresa Heinz Kerry jets across the country in her own private jet and has a bevy of staffers to run a $1.2 billion foundation with a global reach.         Kerry has found himself on the defensive when asked on the campaign trail how, given the vast wealth he and his wife control, he can relate to the struggles of average Americans.         The senator responds by noting it is not where people come from that counts, it's what's in their hearts and the values they care about that really matter.         Kerry's campaign also has stressed how, despite his elite background, public service has been the core of Kerry's life - from volunteering for combat duty in Vietnam to serving as Middlesex prosecutor and then at the State House and on Capitol Hill.         Kerry's wedding to one of the world's richest women seemed to energize him as his 1996 re-election contest with then-Bay State Gov. William F. Weld neared and the race began to draw national attention.         The senator's commanding performance in seven televised debates tipped the balance against Weld, a formidable foe, cementing Kerry's image as a tough comeback campaigner.         ``That was a world-class race,'' said veteran Democratic political consultant Michael Shea, who prepped Kerry for those debates. ``Republicans crawled all over him, but he summoned something in himself to win it. It put him on a track to the White House.''         Kerry also had tapped $1.7 million in personal wealth for campaign loans and loan security that enabled him to go toe-to-toe with Weld on the TV airwaves with hard-hitting commercials.         After the Weld race, Kerry soon set his eyes on the presidency.         He nearly developed labor pains mulling a 2000 White House bid for months, debating endlessly with aides and allies before finally pulling the plug.         Months later, during a tortuous midsummer wait, he narrowly missed the cut to serve as Al Gore's running mate - a blessing in disguise as it turned out, leaving him unencumbered to make his own White House bid.         As Kerry launched his 2004 bid, his wife warned that if a rival made personal attacks against him, she would tap her vast personal wealth to respond.         Under federal campaign law, she can fund her own independent TV ads, so-called ``issues ads,'' as long as they are not part of the Kerry campaign.         ``Would I take it lying down?'' she said of potential personal attacks against Kerry during a Herald interview last year. ``My hunch is I would not.''         During the bruising 2004 presidential primary race, Kerry again turned to his personal wealth, using the Louisburg Square townhome he co-owns with his wife to loan his presidential campaign $6 million in seed money.         The money helped Kerry turn the corner in the primaries.         Depending on how the fall race goes, the $6 million loan could be perhaps the shrewdest financial move Kerry has ever made.

       Boston Herald David R. Guarino   As Sen. John F. Kerry's campaign escalates charges over energy giant Halliburton's government deals and ties to Vice President Dick Cheney, there's one thing they don't mention - the Kerry family's own Halliburton payday.         Teresa Heinz Kerry liked the Cheney-run Halliburton enough to buy and sell more than a $250,000 in company stock in 1996, netting a tidy profit of up to $15,000, records show.         The Kerry family Halliburton investment is tucked in the Massachusetts senator's lengthy financial disclosure forms, reviewed by the Herald.         The records, which limit disclosure only to broad ranges, show one of the Heinz family trusts bought between $250,001 and $500,000 of Halliburton stock on May 13, 1996 - while Cheney was its CEO.         In one of many quick turnaround deals in the Heinz trusts, the Halliburton stock was sold less than two months later for a profit.         The disclosure form reports Halliburton dividends of $1,001 to $2,500 and capital gains at the sale of between $5,001 and $15,000.         Kerry spokesman Michael Meehan said the senator himself has not personally or jointly with his wife owned any Halliburton stock, saying Heinz Kerry's ownership didn't benefit her husband. He said the pair have long held separate investments and assets.         A spokeswoman for Heinz Kerry said the investments are made by professional money managers on behalf of family trusts and the senator's wife is only one of many beneficiaries.         ``Any investments in 1996 have little if anything to do with investment decisions in 2004,'' said Marla Romash, senior adviser to Heinz Kerry.         The revelation comes as Kerry dispatched one of his top surrogates, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), to hammer Cheney and President Bush anew on Halliburton.         Lautenberg, in a conference call to reporters organized by the Kerry campaign, seized on revelations that Halliburton is now under investigation for suspected dealings with Iran - which are illegal.         ``This is the biggest scandal yet to hit Halliburton,'' Lautenberg said. ``This could result in major felony charges because it is illegal to do business with a terrorist state.''         The company denied violating U.S. laws but admitted in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that a grand jury investigation is under way into possible business done in Iran by one of its subsidiaries, located in the Cayman Islands.         ``The question must be asked: did this possible violation occur between 1995 and 2000 while Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton,'' Lautenberg asked.         But Meehan said Heinz Kerry's ownership and profit from Halliburton won't temper the senator's continued criticism.         ``Many Americans, John Kerry [related, bio] included, have big problems with multimillion-dollar companies receiving no bid contracts while the vice president continues to draw money from them and then they overcharge the U.S. government,'' Meehan said.

       Boston Harald David R. Guarino and Andrew Miga   After watching his 16-year marriage dissolve under the klieg lights of politics and fame, John F. Kerry got what he wanted in Teresa Heinz - and then some.         Sure, she had money to bolster his bank accounts and his future campaigns.         But Heinz, already a political widow, was the kind of political spouse Kerry's ex-wife, Julia Thorne, could not and would not be. Since they married in 1995, Kerry's political and personal fortunes have skyrocketed.         Now he has a wife alternately called ``sexy'' and his ``secret weapon.''         And, if you believe Kerry and Heinz, she's grounded him personally as he has never been before and driven a jolt of personality into the serious, senatorial Kerry.         ``Just more relaxed and comfortable and calm about life and much broader vision of all the choices of life, if you will,'' Kerry described how he's changed since marrying Heinz. ``Don't define myself by politics. Very comfortable doing lots of different things. Learned a lot about opening up. Being more accessible.''         And Heinz, now Teresa Heinz Kerry for this campaign, admits her maternal and nesting instincts have calmed the rootless Kerry.         ``My husband . . . had really lived without a proper home life from the time (his) one child was 9 and the other was 6,'' Heinz Kerry told a reporter earlier this year. ``When he married me, he got a home life.''         And, of course, he got the money - estimated at between $550 million and $1 billion in worldwide assets from Heinz Kerry's first marriage to Pennsylvania Sen. H. John Heinz III, who died in a 1991 plane crash.         They have five homes, dozens of cars, boats and the Flying Squirrel, Teresa's private jet.         On the campaign trail, Kerry also has a willing, active participant. Sure she talks prenups and Botox, but Heinz Kerry also draws in an audience with her charm and unique brand of liberal-conservatism.         She told Barbara Walters earlier this year that, when her former husband talked about running for the White House, she said, ``Over my dead body.''         Now, she's the first to stand up for Kerry - and hasn't ruled out dumping millions into the race if his, or her, character are attacked.         And, she admits, he wouldn't be a hair away from the presidency without her.         ``I have an obligation to help because you can't do it halfway,'' Heinz Kerry said. ``You either do it or you don't do it. But I had to come to terms with that myself and if I hadn't, he wouldn't have run.''

       AP Genaro C. Armas   Delegates to next week's Democratic National Convention already have an idea about 2008 if presidential candidate John Kerry  should lose this fall: They would favor Hillary Rodham Clinton over John Edwards as their next standardbearer.   An Associated Press survey found that the first-term New York senator is the choice of more than a quarter of the delegates while Edwards, recently tapped by Kerry to be his running mate, was favored by some 17 percent.   Clinton — former first lady, best-selling author, Democratic star and the politician Republicans vilify for fund-raising appeals — often was a top pick of Democrats in opinion polls prior to the 2004 primaries. In November 2002, the favorite candidates were Al Gore and Clinton, with all others in single digits.   Kerry emerged from the primary process as the Democratic candidate, and Edwards was the last major candidate to bow out. Kerry's choice of Edwards to be the vice presidential nominee raised the profile of the freshman North Carolina senator and pushed his name to the top of the 2008 list, if Kerry falters.   Among the more than 3,000 delegates interviewed, or roughly 70 percent of the 4,300-plus who will attend the four-day event beginning Monday in Boston, most were reticent to offer a favorite, optimistic about Kerry's chances on Nov. 2. Some 36 percent said "none" when asked whom they would like to see as the party's candidate in 2008.   Clinton was favored by 26 percent overall and Edwards 17 percent. Among women, Clinton led Edwards 34 percent to 16 percent. The breakdown among men was Clinton 22 percent, Edwards 21 percent.   "It's time. A lot of people tell me, 'She's a sure loser.' It's time for us to try," said Jennifer O'Donnell, 43, a delegate from Cincinnati, Ohio. "Women have got to try for that seat ... we still don't have the access."   Ruth Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said Clinton's showing among this year's delegates is testament to her strength and potential leadership.   "It's about the fact that finally, in the year 2004, when most active leaders of the party are asked to name leaders of the future, a woman is at the top of the list," Mandel said.   New York-based Democratic operative Hank Sheinkopf said Clinton has a jump on Edwards for 2008 despite the publicity Edwards has received in this year's campaign. "The field could be wide open, but Hillary has an edge coming in," Sheinkopf said.   Edwards will have some three months on the presidential campaign trail, time in the public eye as well as an opportunity to hone his skills.   Lachlan McIntosh, 31, of Summerville, S.C., called Edwards "an up-and-coming star of the Democratic Party."   "He understands ordinary Americans and their plight," said McIntosh, one of more than 530 Democrats attending the convention as delegates for Edwards. The North Carolina senator was planning to send a letter to his delegates asking them to vote for Kerry on the first convention ballot.   Told of the AP delegate survey, Edwards' spokesman Mark Kornblau said, "Very interesting." He declined to comment further, adding, "We're looking forward to accepting the (vice presidential) nomination."   Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines had a similar response. "Senator Clinton will be working hard in 2008 to re-elect John Kerry and John Edwards," Reines said.   In the AP survey, Clinton was more popular than Edwards among delegates who were white as well as those who were black or Hispanic. She also was the choice of those who said they were in a union.   Initially, the New York senator did not have a speaking role at the convention, a Kerry campaign decision that drew criticism from several Democratic women. Within days, an intense lobbying campaign by Clinton backers forced the presidential candidate to ask if she would speak and introduce her husband, former President Clinton, on the opening night. She accepted the invitation.   About 2.5 percent of the delegates favored one-time candidate Howard Dean, the former front-runner. Several others were favored by about 1 percent each: Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, who is keeping his long-shot candidacy alive; retired Gen. Wesley Clark; former Vice President Al Gore; and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.   About 3 percent favored Kerry if he doesn't succeed this year. But several delegates tried to dismiss that notion.   "I have a definite preference (in 2008) — it's Kerry and Edwards," said Jim Alexander, 58, a Kerry delegate from Amarillo, Texas. "If they don't win this year, I hope by golly they try again."

       AP   Much has been made of the contrast between Vice President Dick Cheney and his Democratic challenger, John Edwards. But what about the similarities? Cheney's wife, Lynne, introduced him at a campaign event last week in Pittsburgh — and sounded positively Edwards-esque.   "I have known him since he was 14 years old and working as a janitor at the Ben Franklin store in Casper, Wyoming," she said. "I made a list today of some of the jobs he had. He clerked at a candy store. He bused tables in a cafeteria. He loaded trucks for a dollar an hour. One summer he started out working in a bentonite plant, filling sacks full of a hundred pounds of bentonite and loading them onto railroad cars," she said.  "Then — and this will surprise you — he got his union ticket. And as a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he spent six years, on and off, building power lines to help pay his way through school."  She added: "We live in a great country when a young man with small-town roots and values and common sense can represent his state in the Congress, can become secretary of defense, and can serve as vice president of the United States."  The introduction was oddly reminiscent of Edwards' widely praised stump speech, in which he harks back to revisits his hardscrabble childhood in North Carolina, where his father worked in a mill.  But Lynne Cheney's comments were ironic if only because the Republican National Committee has lacerated Edwards for playing up his humble roots, calling him "phony and disingenuous" on the RNC Web site.

       Detroit Free Press Kathleen Gray   "Hey, everybody."   The 18 Republicans gathered in the Birmingham living room of Cathy Neall knew the voice on the speaker phone and its subtle Texas drawl.   First lady Laura Bush was speaking personally to them and an estimated 100,000 people at 6,900 parties occurring simultaneously across the nation last Thursday night.   Before the half-hour conference call ended, Laura Bush had answered questions from a handful of pre-selected party sites about education, the Hispanic vote, and moving from a traditional industrial to a high-tech economy.   She even corralled her husband, President George W. Bush into saying a few words to the faithful, including those at more than 450 parties in Michigan.

       Seattle Post Joel Connelly July 19, 2004   The favorite Seattle restaurant for Teresa Heinz Kerry is Wild Ginger, fittingly given the spiciness that THK brings to the relentlessly bland world of U.S. presidential politics.  The lady's blunt opinions are delivered in a soft, slightly accented voice. It commands attention and can reduce a raucous rally to quiet, respectful listening. A prime-time appearance at next week's Democratic National Convention will increase public scrutiny of the Mozambique-born, South African-educated wife of Sen. John Kerry.  Heinz Kerry, 65, speaks her mind.  In an interview during last week's Seattle visit, she decried the Bush administration for "cynical manipulation," "narrowness of thinking" and "terrifying ignorance" in its failure to address global warming.  "You are an idiot if you don't do anything," she argued.  She recalled a recent experience in the air over Ohio talking with retired Democratic Sen. John Glenn, who 42 years ago was the first American to circle the Earth in space.   "He said, 'We are at 40,000 feet. In space I was not really much further up. What you see of the atmosphere is that it is a little film above the Earth. It is so thin. Yet, it is all we have.'  "I see an urgency -- in the United States alone, and around the globe -- in restoring and preserving a breathing, healthy planet. Already global climate change is showing its face. I talk to farmers, who say things are not normal. I listen to people who deal with earth and nature, and their findings. ... The point is, even if you talk to the most conservative scientists about their scenarios of warming, you come away convinced we have to do something."  Heinz Kerry grew in Mozambique, then a Portuguese colony, the daughter of a Portuguese doctor and medical researcher. She was active in anti-apartheid groups as a university student in South Africa.       Until recently, she was also a Republican -- but of a subspecies now struggling to survive.  She was married for 25 years to John Heinz, heir to the H.J. Heinz condiment fortune and senator from Pennsylvania from 1976 until his death in a 1991 plane crash.  John Heinz was part of a then-numerous group of moderate Republican senators, hailing from the Eastern Seaboard but also such Western outposts as Oregon and Washington.  The GOP moderates' causes included conservation, a legacy dating to Theodore Roosevelt's designating national monuments and wildlife refuges from islands off Florida to Washington's Olympic Mountains.  It was at a 1990 Earth Day rally with John Heinz that she met her present husband, John Kerry.   The two senators were speaking for what was then a bipartisan cause, at a time when the man in the White House -- George H.W. Bush -- was vowing to be "the environmental president."  Bush delivered, too, with 1991 Clean Air Act amendments that provided a successful framework of economic incentives for industries to reduce emissions.  The death of her first husband made Heinz Kerry overseer of two Heinz family endowments now valued at $1.3 billion. She would become one of the nation's major environmental philanthropists, financing such projects as a Pittsburgh convention center cooled by water flowing over its roof.   She encountered Kerry again at the 1992 global conference on the environment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The couple celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary during a May campaign stop in Seattle.  As the wife of a Democratic senator seeking the presidency, Heinz Kerry now argues that "the bipartisan record of many years" has been betrayed under the administration of Bush's son.  She is equally dismayed at Bush's public statements, from his pronouncement that the Kyoto Protocol on global warming was "dead on arrival" to his skepticism of scientific evidence on global warming.  "As president, you have to have some sophistication in speech, if not in policy," she said.   She is not a down-the-line defender of Kyoto. She said it was "perfectly appropriate" for the Bush administration to explore alternatives less penalizing to industrial nations.  "But to say the science is still out is absurd," she added. "People who don't know science like to doubt and vilify scientists."  Heinz Kerry wants the United States, in its trade treaties, to pay more than lip service to labor conditions, human rights and environmental standards. She suggests as a model the so-called "Sullivan Principles," standards set before South Africa's apartheid government by U.S. corporations as conditions for investment.  She wants the U.S. government to end a decade of dawdling and tighten fuel efficiency standards for new cars.  "If we want to be competitive worldwide, we need to build fuel-efficient cars," she said.  "I sat in a new hybrid at the Detroit auto show. It's a nice, roomy car. It's a safe car, for the soccer mom.  "Why should Americans have to buy a Prius? Why can't our manufacturers come up with such cars?"  As a philanthropist, Heinz Kerry has pursued as her primary causes the environment and early-childhood education. She believes -- fervently -- that the education of women is linked to repairing and sustaining the planet.  "People who work in population will tell you one thing: A woman who is educated has a better say in how she runs her life and the number of children she will bring into this world.  "There is no question. Overpopulation is tied to the environment: It leads to desertification, to the mass movement of refugees, to hunger and to desperation."  It's fascinating stuff, fearlessly delivered.  Despite the soft tones, Teresa Heinz Kerry makes Hillary Clinton look like a shrinking violet.

       Toledo Blade Eileen Folen's Column July 19, 2004   If the upcoming election actually matched equals, and I don't think it will, I'd pick John Kerry, not just for himself, as I will likely do, but for Teresa. That's because in my book there's hardly any woman as dull as the wife of a Republican president. Their spirits seem frozen in place with the same hard gel they use to style their hair. Take Laura Bush. Take Pat Nixon. Take Mamie Eisenhower. Take Betty Ford. Take a sleeping pill.  Some, like Barbara Bush, are known for strong opinions, but since they were funneled through spouses, that may be myth. And who knows how much national policy Nancy Reagan's astrologers made? But don't look for Eleanors, Jackies, or Hillarys in GOP ranks.  If these nice women in respectable cloth coats had individual personalities, let alone lives of their own, as modern women are entitled to, they sure fooled the nation.  If they spoke their minds, it was in the most neutral of circumstances. Nancy Reagan has done a lot better since she took up the cudgel of stem-cell research and gave George W. a few good raps with it.  When Mr. GOP President, whoever he is, has a woman out front these days it is likely one of independent ilk like Mary Matalin, a smart political operative, who is married to a hard-nosed Democratic counterpart. If married to a GOP prez, she'd be confined to inanity.  In Cokie Roberts' new book, Founding Mothers, we learn of the active roles the wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters of the Founding Fathers played in shaping their thinking and the revolution itself.  Today's GOP presidential wives aren't of that ilk, though more of them might have been had the late former Pennsylvania Sen. John Heinz not perished in a plane crash in 1991.  He had presidential ambitions and he came with the spirited Teresa, who quit the GOP after it questioned the patriotism of Max Cleland, a Vietnam veteran who sacrificed three limbs to war.  "One of the saddest things about this administration is its cynical attempt to equate patriotism with singing in the President's amen chorus," she said recently in New York.  "The Americans I have met are tired of being told it is unpatriotic to question this President and his administration's policies."  She struck a particular chord with me when she said at the same event that she hoped "that at the end of this campaign or one day soon, women who have earned the right to their opinions won't be called opinionated."  If Teresa Heinz Kerry doesn't get to teach them, perhaps she'll teach Laura Bush how to do it.  The GOP, I've heard, plans to make nasty remarks about Teresa, the wealth she inherited on the most tragic day of her life, and the fact that she is foreign-born. It will only further cheapen itself by demeaning assets it would have cherished had she been its first lady.  I was once invited by a GOP operative to bring weekend visitors to the rather modest Heinz family homestead near Pittsburgh (some may have seen it in that picture-story of Heinz family and Kerry properties), where there was a fund-raiser.  The then-Mrs. Heinz was an interested, gracious, and knowledgeable person, who brushed off her keepers (they worked for her, not vice versa) and took us on a tour of the house, despite a glower or two from the senator.  My friend's children played with her children on the greensward, and we looked at the family's collection of Hudson Valley artists. The Butler Museum in Youngstown, which we had just visited, has a fine grouping of this genre, and my friend's mom, a mover and shaker in West Virginia, had just bought a Cecelia Beaux.  A friend who did a lot of community redevelopment after the steel industry left southwestern Pennsylvania knew Mrs. Heinz more intimately, especially in the years following the senator's death. She said the paralyzing depth of Teresa's grief attested to the huge love between them.  She speaks of Teresa's courage, her strength on days when the loss was nearly overpowering, of her result-oriented, nonpartisan, and generous assistance, through the various Heinz foundations, to put rundown industrial river cities on the mend and to better the environment.  To be sure, fate endowed Teresa Heinz Kerry with the cash and the loss. But it was she who fashioned them into the mettle of the strong, independent, humorous woman she is today. In the White House, she'd be formidable. Because of her, so would American women.

       AP July 18, 2004   Elizabeth Edwards on Sunday was to make the Democratic presidential ticket's first foray into Tennessee since John Kerry picked her husband, John, as his running mate two weeks ago.  The North Carolina senator's wife was to help dedicate a chapel designed by Vietnam Memorial artist Maya Lin at the former farm of Roots author Alex Haley, now a retreat owned by the Children's Defense Fund.   The Kerry-Edwards campaign said this was Elizabeth Edwards' first solo appearance of the campaign.   The dedication capped a two-day symposium on "Building the 21st Century Movement for Children." Participants included journalist Bill Moyers; Ted Shaw, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; former New York Mayor David Dinkins, and Barnes & Noble chairman and CDF patron Len Riggio.   Hillary Rodham Clinton, once a CDF staff attorney, made a similar appearance before the national advocacy group for the poor, disabled and minority children at the same location in 1999 when she was first lady.   At the time the farm's address was still Norris, as Haley had known it before he died in 1992. The CDF changed it to Clinton, another Anderson County town, after it bought the farm that year.   Edwards' appearance follows first lady Laura Bush's trip last week with Education Secretary Rod Paige to Nashville to tout the historically black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha's Ivy Reading AKAdemy literacy program. The program receives federal funding and is part of the Bush administration's No Child Left Behind initiative.   Bush carried Tennessee over favorite son Al Gore in 2000, and is expected to win the state again this year. He has returned to the state frequently, three times this year alone. Last week he was in nearby Oak Ridge to tout progress in the war on terrorism.

       Reuters Patricia Wilson  Jul 18, 2004    Worth an estimated $500 million, born in Mozambique, fluent in five languages, outspoken and "sexy," Teresa Heinz Kerry is not your average political spouse.   The wife of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry (news - web sites) also runs a $2 billion foundation named after her late husband, Republican Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, and occasionally bakes her special brownies for the campaign press corps.   She is known to close friends as "Momma T," only recently added Kerry's name to hers and changed her party affiliation to Democratic out of anger at the way Republicans treated Vietnam veteran Max Cleland during his unsuccessful re-election bid to a U.S. Senate seat from Georgia in 2002.   "I'm cheeky; I'm sexy, whatever," she told CBS in a recent interview. "You know, I've got a lot of life inside."   On the campaign trail, the 5-foot-5-inch Heinz Kerry introduces her lanky husband -- who stands almost a foot taller -- in a soft, accented voice. Often Kerry asks for the sound to be turned up.   She alludes to her background, the daughter of a doctor raised under a repressive dictatorship in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique and schooled in racially segregated South Africa.   "Places where I come from, people didn't vote," she said recently in Raleigh, North Carolina, campaigning with the newly named vice presidential candidate John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, whom she helped "figure out what clothes you need."   Heinz Kerry, 65, admits she is hardly the stereotypical political wife, but says if voters could not accept her, she would have heard about it by now.   She can be outspoken, disclosing her Botox injections, the 20 pounds she says she has gained on the campaign trail, her prenuptial agreement with Kerry and the fact that he was in the bathroom when he got word of his early wins in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.   She is wealthy from her marriage to Heinz, the heir to the Pittsburgh ketchup empire who died in a plane crash and who, she said, was "kind enough to even introduce me to John (Kerry) the day before he was killed."     Merged families     When she and the senator from Massachusetts married at her multimillion dollar waterfront estate in Nantucket in 1995, two families were instantly melded.   Heinz Kerry has three grown sons. Tall, dark and handsome, Chris, 31, was recently named one of People magazine's 50 hottest bachelors. The most politically active of the children, he quit a job at a New York equity firm to join his stepfather's campaign.   Andre Heinz, 34, lives in Sweden, where he is an environmental consultant. He has made a few campaign appearances. John Heinz IV, 37, a blacksmith and teacher who lives in Pennsylvania, has shunned the limelight.   Kerry has two daughters from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. Alexandra, 30, just graduated from film school in Los Angeles, and Vanessa, 27, is studying medicine at Harvard. Both are single and campaign frequently, both with their father and on their own.   Heinz Kerry plans to keep working at the family's philanthropic network if her husband becomes president "because I am allowed to and I will. I would dry up if I didn't."   "I don't want a public policy job," she told Reuters in an interview earlier this year.   Nevertheless, she said she was "a sounding board" for her husband on his selection of Edwards, a former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination and a one-term senator from North Carolina, to fill out the Democratic ticket.   "Her input is important on everything," Kerry told CNN's "Larry King Live." "First of all, she's smart as a whip. Secondly, she's got as much common sense ... (as) everybody that I've ever met."   But the man who will face Bush in the Nov. 2 election quickly disabused the audience of the notion that Heinz Kerry would be involved in policy matters.   "She doesn't want to be a policy adviser," he said. "She wants to be my wife."

       Pittsburgh Post-Gazette LaMont Jones July 18, 2004    First lady Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, have suited up for most public appearances during George W. Bush's first presidential term. The contenders to join their husbands' White House, Teresa Heinz Kerry and Elizabeth Edwards, bring looks to the campaign that are sartorially distinct.  A quick look at style on the campaign trail:   Bush, a former schoolteacher, went from studied bookishness to a more tailored look after moving into the White House. Cheney, an author and history buff, tends to look more designer-dressed in colorful suits.  By contrast, Heinz Kerry is a prime example of how the power of persona trumps all else. She's fond of open-collar blouses under suits and is frequently seen in a dramatic red blazer. Her shoulder-length auburn hair is longer and more voluminous than the cropped coiffures of most women in powerful public positions, but she seems completely comfortable with it.  The men running for high office tend to be more traditional and predictable, sporting khakis for calculated casual and black or navy suits at other times. Neckties are usually blue or red, especially for the presidential candidates. While the colors are associated with the U.S. flag and political party affiliations, psychologists say blue suggests peace and friendliness while red projects power and authority.

       Cox News Service Gayle White and Moni Basu July 18, 2004   One told her husband he could run for president "over my dead body." The other made her spouse promise that she would never have to make a political speech.  But here they are: Teresa Heinz Kerry is riding the campaign trail hard in support of her husband, soon-to-be Democratic nominee John Kerry, and Laura Bush is scheduled to make a nationally televised address to the Republican National Convention next month for the third time.  The once-reluctant first wives - along with their second sisters, Lynne Cheney and Elizabeth Edwards - are a critical component of the 2004 presidential race. In the quest, they must suppress any personal preference for privacy.  Americans have high expectations of any woman who might occupy the White House.  Pamela Macbeth, 33, a Democrat in Henry County, sums up her criteria: "She should be politically charming. She should be well-versed in current events. She should be dignified. ... She should have her own style but remain poised and glamorous. She shouldn't be too flamboyant. She shouldn't be too plain, either."  Americans don't allow first wives to have eccentricities, said Charlotte Grimes, a former political reporter who teaches at Syracuse University. "They are supposed to be smart, but not so smart as to be threatening. They are supposed to be charming, but should not make the rest of us feel dowdy."  Everything about the candidates' wives, literally from head to toe, is under scrutiny. News reports tell us that Edwards admits dying her hair and that Bush's toenails, "peeking out from comfy espadrilles, are bright red."    In the spotlight   Every gesture is analyzed. Powerful media outlets from The New York Times to National Public Radio noted an attempt by Heinz Kerry to extricate 4-year-old Jack Edwards' thumb from his mouth in a recent photograph. "Frankly, if I were Elizabeth Edwards, I'd smack ol' Teresa on the wrist," a Houston Chronicle columnist wrote. Other articles explained that Heinz Kerry was just following up, mom to mom, on Edwards' efforts. Certainly any deviation from a husband's party line - such as Lynne Cheney's opposition to a constitutional amendment defining marriage as heterosexual - is headline fodder. But much of the wives' influence is in private, where they can criticize their spouses in ways that aides wouldn't dare and control decisions from who runs the campaign to what color tie the candidate wears on television.  By all accounts, the four women behind the men in this year's presidential race are strong, smart and very different from one another. Three have dealt with significant tragedies. Two have switched political parties. One was born outside the United States.  Like Martha Washington, who inherited her first husband's plantations before marrying the slightly younger George, Teresa Heinz Kerry was a wealthy widow when she met and married her younger second husband. She grew up the daughter of a Portuguese physician in Mozambique, went to boarding school in Switzerland, marched against South African apartheid and learned to speak five languages.  Before Kerry, she was married to Sen. John Heinz, a Republican condiment heir, whom she told when he considered a run for the presidency, "Over my dead body." After his death in a 1991 plane crash, she turned down overtures to run for his Senate seat, instead assuming hands-on management of the huge family foundations. She is now a registered Democrat. She has three sons and is stepmother to the Massachusetts senator's two daughters.  Heinz Kerry rarely hesitates to speak her mind. A lifelong Catholic, she has said she planned to have an abortion because of a malformed fetus, but miscarried. When asked about Botox treaments, she replied, "I need another one - soon." Asked to describe herself, she once said, "I'm cheeky, I'm sexy, whatever."    A Texan's tale   Laura Bush, on the other hand, is Texas born and bred, the only child in a family that, like much of Texas at the time, was solidly Democratic. At 17, she ran a stop sign, causing a collision that killed a good friend, an event that, she told biographer Ann Gerhart, "made me have more of a perspective on life." She was a librarian at a barrio school in Austin in 1977 when friends insisted that she meet George W. Bush. The couple was considering adoption because of difficulty conceiving when she became pregnant with twin daughters. Although she made her husband promise when he made his first, unsuccessful run for Congress that she would never have to address a crowd, Bush has become an accomplished campaigner. As first lady, she promotes literacy and literature. She vacations with girlfriends and weeps at old hymns. In a family that loves nicknames, her father-in-law calls her "Laura-Steady-as-She-Goes."  Elizabeth Edwards, like Heinz Kerry, is older than her husband. As the daughter of a Navy pilot, she spent much of her childhood outside the United States. She married law school classmate John Edwards in 1977, right after they took the bar exam, and practiced bankruptcy law under her maiden name, Anania. After their 16-year-old son, Wade, died in a car accident in 1996, she adopted her husband's last name, underwent fertility treatments and gave birth to two more children, the younger when she was 50. She acknowledges battling her weight but finds it difficult to refuse brownies on the campaign trail.  After a recent church service in Raleigh, she sought out old friends and church acquaintances. "Hey, y'all," she said, a broad smile never erased from her face. She mocks chagrin at her husband's youthful good looks, refers to herself as the "anti-Barbie," and, when asked once how she can speak so intellligently, replied, "I'm a girl."  Her direct competition, vice presidential spouse Lynne Cheney, moved from Wyoming to Washington in the 1970s when her high school sweetheart husband became part of the Nixon and Ford administrations. She's the author or co-author of several books, among them "Executive Privilege" (1979), about a journalist's dilemma over national security vs. the public's right to know; "Sisters" (1981), a historical romance that includes a lesbian love affair; and "The Body Politic" (1989), a story of political intrigue after the death of a Republican vice president who had a heart attack while in bed with a TV reporter. Her more recent efforts have been children's books about America, including "A Is for Abigail - An Almanac of Amazing American Women."  During the Reagan administration, she was tapped to head the National Endowment for the Humanities, and later advocated dismantling the agency. Her crusade against offensive lyrics prompted the rapper Eminem to bash her by name in later lyrics. She is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.  Cheney has two daughters. One is an open lesbian, the other married with children. "I'm mellower than I used to be," she has said. "It's the grandchildren."    Their mission...   The women in this year's campaign will be used to target particular constituencies and make specific impressions - just as Eleanor Roosevelt energized black voters and Lady Bird Johnson shored up white Democrats after her husband signed the Civil Rights Act, predicted Robert Watson, a political scientist at Florida Atlantic University. Bush and Edwards are expected to project warmth and images of hearth and home, said Watson, author of "The Presidents' Wives: Reassessing the Office of First Lady." Heinz Kerry will likely woo intellectuals and first- and second-generation Americans, especially Hispanics. Cheney, as a former co-host in the conservative chair for the CNN series "Crossfire," can be a firebrand for the harder-core Republican constituency. Conversely, as the mother of a lesbian who balked at the Republican ticket's insistence on a federal marriage amendment, she can soften the ticket's strident image on that issue.  Some observers suggest Cheney's public opposition of the marriage amendment may have been calculated by campaign officials.  "Whenever a wife comes out and says something to the press, it has a meaning," said Catherine Allgor, a historian at the University of California Riverside and author of "Parlor Politics."  "Because it's unofficial, she can't get in trouble for it. Her husband's supporters might carp about it, but it's not an official statement. Just an opinion."  Wives often build up their own fan base on the campaign trail. Supporters of Betty Ford and Pat Nixon produced campaign buttons that said "Elect Betty's Husband" during Gerald Ford's campaign and "I'm for Pat" when people felt less sure of her husband, Richard Nixon. Similarly, at a recent Democratic rally in Raleigh, some people in the crowd held up handmade signs that said "Teresa" and "Elizabeth."  Aside from their own personalities, wives are evalutated for their relationship with their husbands.  Heinz Kerry seemed to be aware of this in a "60 Minutes" interview when she promised that she and Edwards will keep their husbands "honest."  While Americans want their first ladies to provide strength and accountability to the men in their lives, some voters are put off by women whose own personalities or ambitions seem too strong. Hence some aversion to Hillary Rodham Clinton, now a senator from New York.  Clara Haynes, 54, a Republican former federal employee from Toco Hills, admired Jackie Kennedy's style, Betty Ford's openness about her breast cancer and Rosalynn Carter's efforts to be "down to earth." But, she said, "I'm sorry. I just didn't like Hillary."  Laura Bush seems able to balance strength and subservience, said Gil Troy, a political historian at McGill University in Montreal and author of "Mr. and Mrs. President: From the Trumans to the Clintons."  "She exudes confidence and power without seeming threatening. She doesn't rock the boat and doesn't upstage her husband."  Bush, said Troy, "lives by the Hippocratic oath by which first ladies are bound: First of all, do no harm."  Heinz Kerry, on the other hand, is already drawing fire. Talk radio hosts make fun of her scarves - she designed one for the campaign. And some Internet bloggers have posted vicious comments about her pumpkin spice cookie recipe, submitted for a Family Circle magazine bake-off with Bush's oatmeal-chocolate chunk goodies.  "Ooh, the Te-Ray-za's cookies are the color of baby poop," wrote one blogger. "Must be an East African Portuguese Apartheid thing," wrote another.  Criticism of Heinz Kerry may be code for portraying her and her husband as "foreign," said Barbara McGowan, professor of history at Ripon College in Wisconsin. "I guess the positive thing for the Republicans is that Laura is such a bland, noncontroversial figure that nobody's trying to berate Laura Bush."  There are signs that the country is becoming more comfortable with "activist" first ladies, said Barbara Burrell, a public opinion specialist at Northern Illinois University. In a recent Gallup Poll asking people who they preferred as first lady, Bush or Clinton, Bush won overall. But among people under 30, Clinton came out on top.  And, in an open-ended question in December year about the country's most admired man and woman, the winning odd couple was - drumroll please - George W. Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton.  The conflict over Clinton will only increase if, as many people speculate, she makes her own run for the presidency.  Should a woman win the Oval Office, how would Americans respond to the country's first first gentleman?  "I think we can handle it," said Burrell. "But if it's Bill Clinton, all bets are off."

       Boston Globe Raja Mishra July 18, 2004   Elizabeth Edwards, former literature student and full-time mother, and now suddenly a big-time Democratic spouse, quietly addressed a 3,000-person fund-raiser here, closing with a poem by Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney.   "I'm going to make sure I don't mess up this quote," she told the crowd, "so I'm going to read it."   Teresa Heinz Kerry took the microphone next, running her hands through her unruly hair and delivering remarks that were more Oprah than oratory. "The world is chaotic. Life is complex," she said, explaining that her husband could help the nation in such times. She offhandedly called Democratic vice-presidential pick John Edwards her husband's "other running mate."   Like their husbands, these two women now in the political spotlight have vastly differing life stories and personal styles -- with potential political consequences. The Kerry campaign hopes the addition of John and Elizabeth Edwards helps soften the image of the Massachusetts senator viewed in some quarters as stiff, aloof and privileged.   Elizabeth Edwards, a lawyer, seemed nervous in front of the crowds, often rushing through her remarks.   But her forthright manner and unpretentious personality won many fans during the Democratic primary, and the Kerry campaign plans to use her extensively.   In contrast, Teresa Heinz Kerry's rarefied life -- her youth in Mozambique, her mastery of five languages, her enormous wealth -- may remind voters that the Kerrys are very different from most of them.   Individually, each woman could attract voters from different social strata -- Southerners, immigrants, professionals, artists -- or they could cancel each other out. Like their spouses, Edwards and Heinz Kerry present a more complex picture than the baby boomer modernism conveyed by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper Gore in 1992, an aura that helped Bill Clinton contrast himself with the older George H.W. Bush. Many Americans are just now getting a first glimpse at the two new Democratic spouses, and it remains to be seen how the two women will affect voters' impressions of the Kerry candidacy.   Asked about the new partnership on CBS' 60 Minutes last weekend, Elizabeth Edwards said: "I think we need to start looking for silver anniversary gifts. This is a marriage that's working." Heinz Kerry, interviewed on the same program, added, "All we've done is laugh and have a good time." She continued that, "When you're happy and when you feel good chemistry, and you're at ease with yourself and those around you, and have good energy and all that, you laugh. ... It's therapeutic and it's happy."   The Kerry campaign says the two women have become fast friends since John Edwards got the vice-presidential nod last week. They flew to New York together in Heinz Kerry's private jet while their husbands campaigned in Florida. Heinz Kerry has called her counterpart an "earth mother" in several public forums. They do share one tragic connection. Both lost loved ones in accidents: Teresa, a husband, in 1991, Elizabeth, a son, in 1996.   Already, Elizabeth Edwards' role in the campaign appears to be growing. John Edwards has long relied on a small circle of advisers, led by his wife. Several of them have joined Kerry's Washington-based staff, but the advisers that now surround him day to day are relative strangers brought over from the Kerry team. Thus, he is likely to lean on his wife even more.   Elizabeth Edwards, say her friends, is her husband's closest adviser and often critiques his political positions. On the Democratic primary campaign trail, she helped sharpen Edwards' views on issues, including foreign policy, giving her husband reading material on Middle Eastern politics.   To most Americans, she is an unfamiliar face. However, Linda Bilmes, a Harvard public policy professor, knows her well. She recalled their first meeting several years ago, when Edwards inquired about renting her house in Washington, D.C.   "The second conversation we had lasted four hours. We talked about Wade, because I had had a similar loss in my life," said Bilmes, whose brother died when she was young.   Wade Edwards, the couple's firstborn son, died at age 16 in a car crash, sending his parents into a spiral of sadness that John Edwards still only reluctantly discusses. But his wife is more at ease with the loss.   "She's a very real person who has suffered a lot and gone on. She has a tremendous ability to empathize," said Bilmes, still close to the Edwards family. "I liked her instantly."   Dante Scala, a political scientist at St. Anselm's College in Manchester, N.H., said that during that state's Democratic primary earlier this year, "it was John Edwards' wife who made more of an impression than John Kerry's simply because John Edwards didn't have as many surrogates around him as John Kerry. People got to see more of Elizabeth Edwards, and they seemed to like her."   But he doubted that either would have political impact rivaling that of Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1992, the last Democratic first lady.

       NY Daily News Michele Ingrassia July 18, 2004    Men may have women outnumbered in the corridors of power, but on this year's campaign trail, it's the women who are out in force. Sure, they're surrogate voices for the Big Boys, but if you don't think Americans will be looking at the way they dress and wear their hair, at whether they lose 15 pounds on the South Beach Diet or gain 10 eating too many campaign-plane fries — pass the W Ketchup; no, make it Heinz — you miss the point. Politics has become Hollywood; it's all about image.   Laura Bush:    You can hear the, "Oh, George" in her voice every time she speaks. But unlike the early days, when it seemed that her chief role was to tame the cowboy in W., the former librarian has grown into a powerhouse talker and fund-raiser on her own. And thanks to a personal trainer (check the waist-nipping jackets) and friendships with designers like Oscar de la Renta (no more purple plaid suits), the 57-year-old First Lady also looks younger and buffer than she did four years ago.   Lynne Cheney:    She's probably the most enigmatic woman in D.C.: A senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a one-time panelist on "Crossfire" who may be even more staunchly conservative than her husband — the vice president. But Cheney, 63, also has two daughters, one of whom is lesbian and the author of "Sisters," a 1981 novel with lesbian themes that she battled, successfully, to keep from being reissued this year. Want consistency? Check out the helmet hair, the stern suits and the flag pins, which haven't changed in decades.   Elizabeth Edwards:    She's smart, savvy and a native of Florida. And though she's a lawyer in her own right, the 55-year-old traded in her suits to have two late-in-life children — Emma Claire, now 6, and Jack, 4 — after the Edwards' first son, Wade, died in a 1996 car accident. Her strength, though, seems to lie in her sense of humor — her ability to laugh off the he's-prettier-than-you comparisons to her husband and to wave away the brownies that aren't on her South Beach diet.   Teresa Kerry:    With her strange accent (she was born in Mozambique and speaks five languages), her quirky sense of humor and her I-have-more-billions-than-you-ever-will confidence, Heinz Kerry exists in a rarified world all her own. But so far, the 65-year-old heiress and mother of three sons (and two stepdaughters) seems to be connecting, thanks to a willingness to discuss anything from Botox to cheating spouses (she favors the first, not the second). Her biggest challenge: to make herself less Chanel, more Kmart.

       Washington Post  Mark Leibovich July 18, 2004   Elizabeth Edwards is sitting at the Broadway Diner on Friday morning, trying to divulge something fresh about herself. She is trying to muster some piece of information -- pure and pristine and hitherto unknown -- that gets beyond the shorthand of her newly famous profile.     The shorthand comes in 30-second roundups, insta-portraits and woman-in-the-news profiles. It is made up of tidy packets of biographical details that people keep hearing and reading (and hearing and reading) about the wife of John Edwards, the Democrats' presumptive vice presidential nominee: Edwards, 55, is four years older than her husband. They met in law school, and at the end of their first date, John kissed Elizabeth gently on the forehead. She found this really sweet. They got married a few days after taking their bar exams. They celebrate their anniversary each year at Wendy's (site of the first date).   This is how Elizabeth Edwards's public self has been reduced, rendered and rehashed to a flurry of snapshots, a few key pixels of her life. "When you try to convey something in a shorter way, the farther you move from the truth of it," she says. "So you do see, sort of, almost a monochrome picture of yourself. It does resemble you. But it's not truly you."   She is not complaining. She is, in fact, having a blast, excited about the Democratic convention next week in Boston. She's romping through Manhattan on this day, shopping for convention clothes and still ebullient about John Kerry's decision to select her husband.   But Edwards is also acutely attuned to the abnormalities that descend (like Secret Service agents) when you achieve the rank of public property. This is apparent as she struggles to come up with something about herself that is not yet known, that will enrich and advance her profile, somehow.   "I had a banana!" she says, raising her voice in a burst of faux revelation about what she ate earlier that morning.   And now, The Washington Post has learned, she is eating two eggs over light on toast, no potatoes.   Back to the shorthand bio: In 1996, John and Elizabeth Edwards's 16-year-old son, Wade, was killed in a car crash, a blow that spurred John into politics and Elizabeth out of her law practice. Wade Edwards would have turned 25 today. Elizabeth often thinks of how much Wade, who had urged John to go into politics, would be loving all this. It's all so bittersweet, she says, "the adjective that will describe the whole rest of our lives, if we're lucky."   At 48, Elizabeth bore a daughter, Emma Claire (now 6) and, at 50, a son, Jack (now 4). Both were conceived with the help of fertility treatments, which we know because that, too, is part of the standard shorthand -- as well as the tidbit that she dyes the gray out of her hair, struggles with her weight and is commonly described as approachable, outspoken and "real."   Edwards looks like any other woman eating breakfast in New York, except she has guys with earphones and black armored SUVs parked outside. She sits alone with a reporter -- no press aide or entourage, just a tape recorder that she sets down on the table. She talks fast and giggles easily and is absolutely convincing when she says she can walk up to any stranger in this restaurant and strike up a discussion. She has a comfort with new faces that she says derives from her childhood as a military brat.   Edwards is the daughter of a Navy pilot and lived in a dozen places by the time she was 18. "There is no better experience" in preparing someone for the madness of a presidential campaign, she says. "None of these people frighten me in any way," she says, surveying the half-filled diner.   Her eyes are blue, big and busy, conveying a presence and a sense of wakefulness. "Rest is overrated," is one of Edwards's mantras. She sleeps, on average, about five hours a night, and rarely for consecutive hours.   She is a lifelong insomniac. As a child in Japan, she would lie awake with a transistor radio hidden under her pillow and listen to "Gunsmoke" and "Have Gun -- Will Travel" on Armed Forces Radio. She could never just close her eyes and turn off her mind. These days, she reads, watches C-SPAN or goes shopping online.   "I go periodically to the computer and Google my husband," she says.   This tendency accelerated in the days that preceded Kerry's selection of his running mate. On the night before he announced his decision, Elizabeth Edwards fell asleep around 11 and was awakened at 12:30 a.m. by a call from their older daughter, Cate, who had just graduated from Princeton and was in the process of moving. Elizabeth got out of bed and compiled lists of things to do. She wasn't tired. She went online and Googled. She found the now-laughable (but then unsettling) New York Post headline that said Kerry would pick Richard Gephardt. She read this closely. She noted that the story was not sourced, that it said only, "The New York Post has learned" and that it didn't have a byline. She decided not to pay attention to the New York Post. Edwards has a sharp eye for the authentic and is easily offended by artifice. She was militant during the primaries about not putting John in any strange hats, poses or contrived settings. Once, the Edwards for President staff wanted to do a photo op of John flipping pancakes, but it didn't get past Elizabeth. "She said, 'He never does that in real life, why should he do it now?' " says Elizabeth's brother Jay Anania, a filmmaker who lives in New York. (Elizabeth notes that the pancake idea didn't get past John either.)   When people rave about how "real" Elizabeth Edwards is, it could be code for any number of things: It could be that she offsets the smooth, telegenic bearing of her husband. Or that she struggles for the balance between family and career, or that she looks like a real neighbor with whom you could have coffee (if she drank coffee), or that she calls herself "the anti-Barbie" and has dabbled in the South Beach Diet.   She is married to a multimillionaire trial lawyer-turned-senator, but Edwards is at her most impassioned when she describes herself as a player in a "regular American life." "John always uses the word regular," she says. "He used to say, 'That guy's a regular guy.' It's the nicest thing he could say about them. It means there's no artifice there."   Elizabeth Edwards was reading a newspaper story this morning about how Kerry needs to get a dog, how it would enhance his image. She is smirking as she mentions this "silliness, when you do something just for the impression it gives." (In fact, John Kerry and Teresa Heinz Kerry do own a dog, a German shepherd named Kim.)   She is fully aware that most people, if they bother to learn about her at all, will do it in shorthand form. They may learn that she was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and that she's 5-feet-2 and that Emma Claire likes Dora the Explorer and Jack likes the Wiggles and that both kids have outgrown the Teletubbies.   And maybe one or two will notice when Edwards gets up from the breakfast table and heads off to buy an outfit or three for the convention, "something I'll look good in." She leaves with a determined smile and no fuss and a battalion of Secret Service agents who materialize out of nowhere, one of whom is asked by a waiter on his way out, "Is that lady famous?"

       Pittsburgh Post-Gazette LaMont Jones  July 18, 2004   Elizabeth Edwards had to know it was coming.  When Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry chose her husband, John Edwards, as his vice presidential running mate, it was inevitable that part of the intense media spotlight would also shine on her.  After all, this is 21st-century America, and dissecting the appearance of public figures from head to toe -- especially women -- seems to have become a very public political rite of passage. A woman's wardrobe, her hairstyle, even her size are taken by the public as clues to who she is and, in the process, spark more than a little conversation at office water coolers.  Back in 1992, Hillary Rodham Clinton was ridiculed for the headbands she wore when hubby Bill was campaigning for president. As with other first ladies before her, image-makers quickly went to work polishing and refining her appearance. The same happened with present presidential wife Laura Bush, whose brown tresses are decidedly less brown than when she moved into the White House.  And so the scrutiny begins with Elizabeth Edwards, the newest face in this year's race. Will she get a makeover during the campaign and if her husband becomes vice president?  Should she?  She would probably answer "no." In one interview, she declared herself "the anti-Barbie." She's short, dark-haired, plump -- and comfortable in her skin, something other women sense and in some ways admire.  Edwards, the newest spouse in the campaign, presents a picture that is both unconventional and likable. She has given birth to five children, the last two at the ages of 48 and 50. She appears not the least bit self-conscious about her middle-age appearance. She's a 54-year-old woman comfortable in her own skin who projects a realness that many find endearing.  "I guess what I find appealing about Mrs. Edwards is her classic, updated approach to dressing," said Tom Julian, a Pittsburgh native and New York-based trend analyst with Fallon Worldwide. "Her wardrobe does not seem to be hip, trendy or sexy but functional and formulaic for her -- as a mom and a woman on the road with her husband's campaign trail. I kind of think she represents the real shape, look and feel of today's baby boomer and that she stays to classic patterns with shots of bright color to make a statement."  The personable lawyer who gave up her career to raise her family, Edwards' style aesthetic veers toward black pants with unstructured jackets (often black) and a splash of color. She often wears knit tops and rolls up her jacket or shirt sleeves, practical for a PTA mom but perhaps too casual for influential women inside the Beltway.  Yet her wardrobe is unproblematic for some observers.  "I'm more attracted to her face -- hair, makeup and smile, first and foremost," said Julian. "The clothes to me become secondary. Does she need a makeover? She might be better in a few signature looks and pieces from soft but stylish resources like Eileen Fisher or Dana Buchman. But I'm not dictating it!"  Hair guru Philip Pelusi, owner of 13 salons in the Pittsburgh area, said Edwards has a strong identity that is "endearing," she she could "have a little more fun with fashion."   For example, she could benefit from a hairdo that reshapes her bob-style locks, and color highlights would break up monochrome-brown monotony, Pelusi said.  "Hair could probably do more for her than anything else. All you see is one ball of hair, and there's a lot of roundness going on. Round face, shoulders, neck. Shaping it where it contours in her neck a little more would enhance her neck."  Pelusi also recommended thinning her eyebrows a touch "to open up her eyes."  "Nothing major, but minor things can make a big difference," he said. "Otherwise, her character and everything, I think, stands on its own."  Color and jackets become Edwards, and she should continue to wear them, said fashion designer Dana Buchman. Still, Buchman added, Edwards should tweak a few things because being seen on television and onstage places new demands on appearance.  "Now that she'll be moving into prime limelight, she will have to look at herself differently than as the normal, intelligent, active citizen that she's been before. The thing any woman in the limelight has to do is look at herself in a full-length mirror and make sure the clothes are flattering. The ready-for-the-camera once-over is something I'm sure she'll be taking care of."  Things that may have mattered little before, such as flattering fit and shoe condition, are more important when one becomes a public figure, said Buchman, which is why it's helpful to have a professional stylist or a good friend with style to provide an objective perspective.  "I think she's a very good-looking woman, and it's just a matter of sort of looking at how she's put together with an eye toward major public scrutiny," the designer said. "A 'dotting the I's and crossing the T's' sort of thing."

       The New York Times John Tierney July 18, 2004   Now that they're a team, John Kerry is smiling for real and John Edwards has a newly combative look in his eyes. But to Daniel Hill, who has been cataloging body language on the campaign trail since last fall, the most interesting sight now is the face-off between Teresa Heinz Kerry and George W. Bush.  "Teresa and George have the most expressive faces and are the least disciplined and scripted," said Dr. Hill, the president of Sensory Logic, a marketing firm that uses a system developed at the University of California at San Francisco to interpret the movements of 43 muscles in the face. "Both of them show anger with narrowed eyes and tight lips. He shows disgust by raising his upper lip, while she shows it by having the lower lip push down the corners of the mouth."   During Mrs. Heinz Kerry's appearance last Sunday on "60 Minutes," as she and her husband were noticeably fumbling to find a comfortable way to hold hands, Mrs. Heinz Kerry displayed what Dr. Hill calls a "super sneer," in which the lips are parted and the mouth resembles a horizontal funnel. At rallies, he says, she often flashes what he calls social smiles, but rarely genuine smiles like Mr. Bush's.   "Teresa makes me think of a Granny Smith apple - tasty but a bit tart," Dr. Hill said. "The conundrum for Bush is that on one hand he smiles genuinely quite commonly, which is nice and upbeat, but it's combined often with contempt. You can see that either as cockiness or as smugness, depending on how you're oriented to him."  Dr. Hill has only recently noted many genuine smiles from Mr. Kerry. "Since Edwards joined the ticket, Kerry is about as happy a camper as he's going to get, but he's still not very expressive," he said. "Edwards is so smooth and telegenic it's really quite amazing. His genuine smiles have even gone up a notch recently, and he's almost always placid, but lately for the first time he's been narrowing his eyes in a mild expression of anger, as if he's working into the groove of being more combative."  What about Mr. Edwards's opponent, Vice President Dick Cheney? "Only one side of his face moves, and when it does, it's almost always a contempt expression," Dr. Hill said. "Mainly he just doesn't show a lot. I call him the Mana Lisa."

       Agence France Jean-Louis Doublet  July 18, 2004   First Lady Laura Bush has cast herself into politics with a vengeance, imploring American voters, in an ever expanding slate of speeches and television appearances, to reelect her husband, President George W. Bush.   On one Wednesday she was in Oregon, on another day New Mexico, both considered key states in the November 2 presidential election.   On a Wednesday night she braved a guest spot on the late night television talk show hosted by comedy satirist Jay Leno, whose barbed wit is anything but politician-friendly.   Born November 4, 1946, Laura Bush is a librarian and schoolteacher who puts strong stock in reading and a solid elementary education.   In 1977, a few months after they met, the Bushes were married, and she has not worked full-time since, dedicating herself instead to raising their twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, born in 1981.   In her frequent school visits, the First Lady generally avoids campaigning for her husband. But, as was the case in New Mexico, the school visits are often followed by electoral meetings at which she is not shy about espousing the Republican Party agenda.   Laura Bush learned election campaign basics quickly. Anecdotes that work are repeated and refined again and again at stops along the campaign trail. “When George asked me to marry him, he promised I’d never have to give a political speech, and I promised I would go jogging with him every day,” she said.   “Since then, I’ve given a lot of speeches but I’ve never done any jogging. I guess that makes us even.” It always gets a laugh.   Small, full-figured, with sparkling eyes and an engaging smile, Laura Bush lacks the solid and reassuring substance of her mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, herself an American First Lady from 1989 to 1993.   Nor does she possess the intellectual reknown wife of former president Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, who went on to be elected US senator from New York.   Born and raised in the south Texas middle class, wife of the former governor of Texas who became president of the United States, Laura Bush is a study in contrast with the wife of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, Bush’s Democratic opponent for the White House.   Teresa Kerry, born to a Portuguese family in Mozambique, is a billionaire heiress who speaks at least five languages.   But Laura Bush, nonetheless, wields a strong influence over her president-husband.   According to a published account by journalist Bob Woodward, after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when an enraged Bush vowed aloud to capture al-Qaeda chief Osama bin-Laden “dead or alive,” Laura Bush implored him to “tone it down.”   Bush often indulges in an offhanded familiarity when referring to his wife. In a speech a few months ago, before heading for a weekend at his Texas ranch, he called her “the lump in my bed.”   Laura Bush doesn’t hide the fact that several of her oldest friends are Democrats.   She also cultivates simplicity, and told Leno on the Tonight Show that, although “People actually call me ‘First Lady,’ I think I’d just rather be called by my name.”   She is frank about what she sees as her role beside her husband.   “Actually, when he was running for Congress the very first time, his mother told me—Barbara Bush said—never criticize George’s speeches,” she said. “So I really took her advice to heart and never criticized any of his speeches.”   Laura Bush is jealously vigilant over her own and her daughters’ privacy.   When Leno asked when was the last argument she had with the president, she replied: “Jay, what happens in the White House stays in the White House.”

       KOMO July 16, 2004    "Bush on Mars in 2004" bumper stickers were offered for sale and Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of the Democratic presidential candidate, was the featured speaker at a Democratic fund-raising rally Friday.   Gov. Gary Locke and gubernatorial contenders Ron Sims and Christine Gregoire also addressed a crowd of about 800 partisans who paid $50 per ticket.   Heinz Kerry, wife of Sen. John Kerry, spoke at length about her hopes for change in the country.   The rally at the state convention center was a fund-raiser for the governor's race, with the winner of September's Democratic primary - either Attorney General Gregoire or King County Executive Sims - receiving the proceeds.   Around $40,000 was raised, said Sam Rodriguez, Washington state director for the Kerry campaign.   Heinz Kerry talked about the need for leaders who can inspire, while building a country that is stronger and safer at home and respected around the world.   "... We have got to recreate, give a rebirth to the great spirit of this country," she said, "for the sake of our kids, for the sake of the world and peace."   On Thursday, Heinz Kerry met with cancer patients at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance on the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center campus, and participated a health care round table discussion.   She brought up her views on health and wellness again Friday, but also spoke on education, the environment, oil dependency and the war in Iraq.   "Don't ever send a child to war because of our dependency on oil, ever," Heinz Kerry said.   Gregoire received a rousing ovation. She spoke of the importance of the presidential election before focusing on her platform of educational opportunities, job growth and health care.   Sims talked about the need for tax reform in the state. He added he was tired of reading about the recent trend of several state colleges having to turn away transfer students.   And both took their shots at the Bush administration.   "November will be so sublime, so sublime, to see the end of George W. Bush," Sims said.   Locke, the Democratic incumbent, is not seeking a third term as governor.   Dino Rossi, the Republican front-runner for governor, had a fund-raising event scheduled Friday evening with Republican governors in town for this weekend's National Governors Association meeting.

       Seattle TimesBeth KaimanJuly 16, 2004   Teresa Heinz Kerry, meeting with doctors and patients yesterday at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, sharply criticized the Bush administration for its restrictions on stem-cell research, calling it a "crime" to "deny people who are so sick." Heinz Kerry, wife of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., visited the center as part of a two-day campaign swing that included a private fund-raiser last night and an event today, hosted by Gov. Gary Locke, to raise money for Washington's Democratic nominee for governor.  Heinz Kerry said the Bush White House has been the "least scientific administration in history," criticizing its positions on global warming and medical research. At a brief news conference at the cancer center, she said there should, of course, be controls on stem-cell research to help prevent abuses, but added it was "disrespectful of the ethics of medicine" not to embrace the potential for treatment and cure.  In his first year in office, President Bush said he would permit federal funding for stem-cell research only for studies involving stem-cell lines already in existence. Scientists have said that order limits research and the outlook for treating illness such as Parkinson's and perhaps Alzheimer's disease, which afflicted the late President Reagan.  Kerry has said he would remove those limits if elected president. The issue is certain to get renewed attention this month when Reagan's son Ron speaks at the Democratic National Convention to urge stepped-up stem-cell research.  Meeting with cancer patients and their doctors in examination rooms, Heinz Kerry mentioned several times that health-care issues resonate with her, in part, because her father was an oncologist, her daughter-in-law is a doctor, a niece is a professor of medicine and a stepdaughter, Vanessa Kerry, is in medical school.  In more intimate detail, Heinz Kerry told the patients about two of her campaign traveling companions: Peggy Grossman, who survived lung cancer; and Melinda Blinken, wife of a former U.S. ambassador to Belgium, who beat ovarian cancer. She also mentioned the care her husband had received as a prostate-cancer patient at Johns Hopkins University.  Mostly, though, Heinz Kerry asked questions, softly and specifically. She wondered if Claudette Mallon, 67, a lymphoma patient from Ocean Shores, had experienced symptoms before being diagnosed. She asked if Mary Hermans' multiple sclerosis was making her tired in her fight against acute leukemia.  When she walked into Hermans' room, Heinz Kerry immediately insisted that Hermans and her husband, Colin Hermans, who live on San Juan Island, sit in the room's two chairs. She squatted nearly to the floor, finding a perch on the low footrest of the examination table.  "If I may say so, you don't look sick," Heinz Kerry told Hermans after hearing about her case.  "I hope you're right," said Hermans. &nbsp;Heinz Kerry, widow of Sen. John Heinz, is chairwoman of the $1.6 billion Heinz Family Philanthropies and The Heinz Endowments. She also has spent considerable time on women's health issues and talked often yesterday of the need for women to be empowered to make good decisions about their health.

       AP Tim Booth July 16, 2004    Teresa Heinz Kerry has fond memories of her childhood in Mozambique and watching firsthand the work of her physician father.   It instilled a passion for health in the 65-year-old wife of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry.   Heinz Kerry has a daughter-in-law who is a doctor, a niece who is a professor of medicine and a stepdaughter in medical school.   On Thursday, Heinz Kerry toured a Seattle Cancer Care Alliance facility on the campus of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. After meeting with patients undergoing cancer treatment, Heinz Kerry participated in a health care round table with doctors and cancer survivors from the Seattle area.   She spoke of a need to revamp the current health care system and to focus on prevention.   "A good future for medicine, I think, would be to do amazing things with prevention," she said. "Prevention and early detection are so important."   Heinz Kerry listened intently to every story of cancer struggle and survival and to ideas offered to improve the American health care system.   When visiting patients, Heinz Kerry spoke softly and asked specific questions. Mary Hermans agreed to meet with her despite being scheduled to have a painful bone-marrow biopsy Thursday afternoon "because I would support anyone who has a chance to beat Bush. And I like her."   Heinz Kerry was critical of the Bush administration's approach to health care and the current health care system. If changes are not made, she said, jobs will be lost from companies struggling with health care costs.   Tracey Schmitt, a Bush-Cheney campaign spokeswoman, responded that President Bush has led efforts to enact new health saving accounts to offer affordable insurance options for small businesses and individuals. In contrast, Schmitt contended, John Kerry "has consistently voted to block medical liability reforms" that would lower health care costs.   Cancer has affected Heinz Kerry personally. Last year, her husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was treated at Johns Hopkins University.   During the round table discussion, Heinz Kerry heard from local women on their battles with ovarian and breast cancer and of new studies being conducted at Fred Hutchinson and the University of Washington in hopes of halting cancer in its early stages.   Trish May, chief executive officer of Athena Partners, a bottled water company, told of losing her mother 10 years ago to ovarian cancer, then being diagnosed with breast cancer herself.   May overcame the disease and went on to help found Athena Partners, where 100 percent of net profits from bottled water sales goes to Northwest research and education initiatives on women's cancers.   Heinz Kerry was booked for a private fund-raiser Thursday night and was to be featured at a $50-a-ticket Democratic rally on Friday morning.

       AP Ron Word Jul. 15, 2004   First lady Laura Bush's campaign visit here Thursday is one of dozens she and Teresa Heinz Kerry will make across the country this election season, trying to shine their husbands' images and amplify their messages.  And that's important, some say, because in this age of media-driven campaigns, a presidential candidate's wife can help him attract - or push away - undecided voters. And in an extremely tight race, like the one expected between President Bush and John Kerry, anything that moves even a handful of voters into a candidate's camp could be a deciding factor.  "Wives send an indirect message to voters," said Mary Ellen Balchunis-Harris, assistant professor of political science at LaSalle University in Philadelphia, noting that a lot can be told about the candidates by their choice of spouses. For example, she said, Bill Clinton's marriage to the forceful, politically ambitious Hillary Rodham Clinton helped him among women because it showed he would be responsive to their issues.  Laura Bush helps the president by "softening" his image, said Robert Watson, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton who has studied first ladies.  For example, while the president's campaign speeches often focus on the Iraq war, terrorism or the economy, his wife visited a Florida hospital Thursday to discuss heart disease among women. Unlike Hillary Clinton, a lawyer who pushed controversial causes like universal health care and reveled in campaigning, Laura Bush, a former school librarian, has voiced a dislike for campaigning and has championed less-confrontational issues like childhood reading.  Only when questioned by reporters did she delve into controversial issues like the war.  "I'm very proud of my husband. I'm proud of him for leading the United States in the cause of freedom. I'm proud that the Iraqi interim government is now building their country. I'm proud that women in Afghanistan can walk outside without male supervision and that girls are in school in Afghanistan, many for the first time in their lives," Bush said.  While Laura Bush has stayed mostly out of the political spotlight, he said, Heinz Kerry often seeks it out. An heiress to the Heinz ketchup family fortune as the widow of the late Sen. John Heinz III, R-Pa., she became Kerry's second wife in 1995.  Christopher Malone, an assistant professor of political science at Pace University in New York, said "If Laura Bush is the anti-Hillary, then Teresa Heinz Kerry is the anti-Laura."  Heinz Kerry grew up in the then-Portuguese colony of Mozambique in East Africa, the daughter of a Portuguese physician and a mother who was part Italian, Swiss-German and French. The campaign has taken her away from her full-time work on environmental, health care and women's issues as head of the $1.2 billion Heinz Foundation endowment. She is often more blunt and outgoing than her husband.  "She is willing to take a few more chances," Malone said. "They are trying to find a way to make her presentable and tone her down. She is not mainstream American."  Matt Miller, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign, disputed that assertion and called her "a terrific asset to the campaign."  Dianne Bystrom of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University said wives can't afford to opt out of their husbands' presidential campaigns. She pointed to the criticism Judy Dean received when she was not out stumping with her husband, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, when he was seeking the Democratic nomination last winter.  But not everyone agrees the candidates' wives make any difference, even in a close race.  Tim Blessing, chairman of the history department at Alvernia College in Reading, Pa., said "the wife of a presidential candidate has traditionally held no impact on his electability."  "Mary Todd Lincoln was called the hellcat, yet American voters re-elected Abe in 1864. Even Jacqueline Kennedy, with all her elegance and grace, was seen largely as an official extension to her husband and thus no threat to the established order," Blessing said in an e-mail.  "Laura Bush probably has not secured one vote for her husband," he said.

       The New York Times Jodi Wilgoren July 15, 2004   But for the microphone, Teresa Heinz Kerry could have been gossiping with the girlfriends she takes with her on her private jet while campaigning solo across the country.   "When you get married when you're older, it's not the same as when you get married when you're a young little thing," Mrs. Heinz Kerry confided to a mostly female crowd of 1,400 here the other day, all wink and nod. "It's better, and it's not the same."   A few hours later, on another stage, she had more to share. "I have to say that John Edwards is very beautiful," she said in her trademark stage whisper, as a ripple of giggles spread across the crowd of 5,000 at a fund-raising concert. "And my husband is very smart."  For all the talk about the new political partner Mr. Kerry picked in Mr. Edwards on July 6, the past week has also been a showcase for the partner he has had for the past nine years, the woman who sometimes stole the spotlight as she - and her eight hanging bags of pantsuits - traveled by his side. There was Mrs. Heinz Kerry, fielding foreign policy questions on CNN's "Larry King Live." That was her reaching across the dual family portrait to dislodge the thumb from the mouth of Mr. Edwards's young son, Jack. Watch her dancing onstage after rallies, nuzzling Mr. Kerry while others speak, grabbing, somewhat awkwardly, for his hand.  And then there are the surprises that spring from her mouth, like the one about how women mind the details like dates, while "the guys think about big things," or how she and Elizabeth Edwards plan to keep the candidates "honest," or how the word "values," the new theme of the Democrats' campaign, "has kind of been loaded one way or the other."  "I have a certain kind of sense of humor, but it's not necessarily other people's sense of humor, so I have to get used to other people's sense of humor as well," Mrs. Heinz Kerry, 65, confided at the luncheon here. "I had initial doubts about my ability to be a good partner in this campaign, whether or not I would hurt, whether or not I would help, whether youth and strength was better than age and wisdom," she continued. "And I am completely convinced that age and wisdom wins every time."  From the onset of Mr. Kerry's campaign, some Democrats have worried about Mrs. Heinz Kerry, the Mozambique-born heiress who speaks five languages and says what she thinks, when she thinks it. But Mr. Kerry and his aides seem now to revel in letting her be herself, and she has been on the road relentlessly since September.  In June, Mrs. Heinz Kerry campaigned alone 20 days, with her husband 2; this week was the first time she had been to her home in Boston (to be fair, she has four others) in three months. At joint appearances, Mrs. Heinz Kerry goes beyond the typical spousal cheerleading to give longer, free-wheeling remarks. On the campaign plane, Mrs. Heinz Kerry, in large, dark sunglasses and toting a glass of wine - in the afternoon, a spritzer - is often the first to venture into the reporters' cabin.  Later this month, Mrs. Heinz Kerry will give a prime-time speech at the national political convention nominating her husband.  "She has a different style; it's not the conventional you-get-three-minutes-to-introduce," said Ann F. Lewis, the White House communications director in the Clinton administration who is now national chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee Women's Vote Center. "Teresa can talk to large political crowds the way women who are just getting to know each other talk at a neighborhood meeting."  It seems to work, at least among audiences at high-dollar fund-raisers where many of the women share her fondness for Chanel shoes and silk scarves. "We'd vote for her in a heartbeat," said Jean Verbridge of Marblehead, Mass., an interior designer who is part of a Republican women for Kerry group. "She needs to be out more."  Across the room, Doe Coover, a literary agent from Winchester, Mass., said she had previously thought Mrs. Heinz Kerry kept herself "a little bit at arm's length," but found her talk "very intimate."   Mrs. Heinz Kerry's regular riff, sometimes hard to hear in her accented hush, describes growing up in a dictatorship, not seeing her doctor father vote until he was 71, marching against apartheid while attending university in South Africa in the 1950's and longing for the days when "the face of America abroad was that of a Peace Corps volunteer." About half of her solo events are geared toward women, focusing on child care, health care, the environment - issues she knows through her work at the United Nations and the foundation named for her first husband, Senator H. John Heinz III, a Pennsylvania Republican who was killed in a plane crash in 1991.   Then there are those unscripted lines.   "You can talk to the simplest person about any issue," she told the women in Boston, seemingly unaware that the people she was referring to might not appreciate that description. To a crowd of 3,200 in New York a few days before, she exulted, "Women for Kerry need birth control, you've gotten so huge," then went on to say, of her sex, "It's time that we who clean up should have a say in how the dirt should be made."  "It is long overdue that the opinions and knowledge of women be part of the governance of the world," she told a huge rally in Raleigh, N.C., on Saturday afternoon, just after saying that she and Mrs. Edwards were counting down days to the election so their spouses could think big thoughts. "And I hope that at the end of this campaign and from next year on, no woman who ever ventures to give an opinion be called opinionated, and that instead she be called smart, thoughtful, or well informed - all of it, just like men.  "We have to cherish women, their health, their wellness," she added, "because a home without a healthy mother or wife is an unwell home."  While Laura Bush often says she became a Republican by marriage, Mrs. Heinz Kerry did not switch her party registration until after the 2002 elections, to protest Republican attacks on Senator Max Cleland of Georgia (she still votes in Pennsylvania, and thus skipped a chance to cast a ballot during her husband's hard-fought 1996 re-election). Yet she has sometimes been the harsher critic of President Bush, suggesting Monday night that he is "fazed by complexity."  On "Larry King Live" last week, Mrs. Heinz Kerry said that "most Americans subconsciously believe" another terrorist attack will happen, adding that the way Mr. Bush went to war in Iraq was "not diplomatic." "I would never have gone to war this way," she said, sounding more candidate than companion. "Remember, this vote was to give the administration, and Colin Powell specifically, the mandate, so to speak, to try peace. And they did till the end of February. They actually wanted to go to war in September. So, we were able to maintain peace till then. Why not wait a little longer?"  Noelia Rodriguez, who was until seven months ago Mrs. Bush's press secretary, said Mrs. Heinz Kerry's outspokenness was refreshing.  "Teresa is comfortable saying things that are off the script, and Mrs. Bush would never do that, or rarely do that," Ms. Rodriguez said. The two could have an intriguing dinner conversation - or, perhaps, a summit meeting on "Oprah!" - Ms. Rodriguez observed, adding that Mrs. Heinz Kerry "definitely needs to see Mrs. Bush's hairstylist" to tame the unruly mane that often hides her eyes.

       CBS News Donald Luskin July 14, 2004   If John Kerry wins the presidency, his household will be the richest ever to occupy the White House. Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, controls a vast fortune estimated by a Los Angeles Times study to fall somewhere between $900 million to $3.2 billion. Through a series of entirely legal maneuvers, Kerry is attempting to conceal from American voters the full extent of his wife's wealth and her corporate holdings -- and the fact that she apparently manages to pay a remarkably small amount of taxes.   Such evidence as one is able to assemble from publicly available information raises deeply disturbing questions. The Kerry campaign has disclosed Mrs. Kerry's 2003 income as $5,115,000. Using a conservative estimate of her wealth at $1 billion -- at the low end of the Los Angeles Times' estimates -- then we can easily see that her investments yielded only a miniscule one half of one percent last year.   In 2003 even Treasury bills yielded twice that much. Dividends on the S&P 500 yielded three times that much. Long-term Treasury bonds yielded eight times that much. If Mrs. Kerry's investment income really was only one half of one percent, then she is perhaps the world's worst investor. Or if her income is in fact greater, and she has found some way to minimize it for tax purposes, then Mrs. Kerry may be the world's greatest cheat.   Let's put this in terms that people of less extreme wealth can relate to. If you had $100,000 invested last year and your investment income was only $500 -- the same percentage as Mrs. Kerry's income -- then something would be very much out of whack.   Perhaps much of Mrs. Kerry's wealth is held in various types of trusts, the income of which is not reported on her personal tax returns. But if that's the explanation, then disclosing only her personal tax returns would be a deceptive exercise in making her income seem as small as possible to voters.   Or perhaps Mrs. Kerry's taxable income has been greatly reduced by legitimate deductions, such as contributions to charity (including her support of liberal political causes like the Tides Foundation). Maybe Mrs. Kerry has found a way to take deductions in connection with her Gulfstream jet, her $5-million ski chalet in Idaho, her $9 million oceanfront "cottage" in Nantucket, her $4 million estate in western Pennsylvania, or the $6.9 million five-story Boston mansion she purchased with her husband.   We can't know exactly what is out of whack with Mrs. Kerry's income, if anything, because she and her husband have always chosen to file separate tax returns. Mrs. Kerry's separate returns have never been made part of the public record.   The Kerry campaign said in March that it will make the first two pages of Mrs. Kerry's Form 1040 available to the public in October, when her tax preparers finalize it. This will give voters no more than a handful of days to consider what little is disclosed there, before going to the polls on November 2.   Even then, the first two pages of Mrs. Kerry's Form 1040 are a mere summary that will disclose virtually nothing we don't already know. They will not disclose specific holdings; income, profits, or losses from individual investments or partnerships; or whether or not Mrs. Kerry utilizes potentially abusive tax shelters or off-shore entities. Mrs. Kerry's reported taxable income will remain suspiciously small in proportion to reasonable estimates of her vast wealth. And voters will have no explanation as to why.   The Kerry campaign justifies this last-minute pre-election peep at Mrs. Kerry's wealth by claiming that George W. Bush did the same thing during the 2000 election with his 1999 returns. But Kerry fails to mention that Governor and Mrs. Bush's entire joint Form 1040 for 1998 -- the prior tax year -- was made available. By the standard set by candidate Bush, Mrs. Kerry should release her entire 2002 Form 1040 immediately -- not just the first two pages -- and she should do so now.   The Kerry campaign argues that more complete disclosure would compromise Mrs. Kerry's right to privacy. But surely a woman who serially marries senators understands that, from time to time, she may have to forfeit that right.   Liberals have argued that Mrs. Kerry's personal fortune has nothing to do with her husband -- after all, she married it. But then again, so did he.   Legitimate concerns extend beyond wondering just how rich Mrs. Kerry really is, and whether she paid her fair share of taxes. There are also questions about power, influence, and conflict of interest. According to the Los Angeles Times, Mrs. Kerry's "money is actively managed every day of the year, providing capital to Gannett, Anheuser-Busch, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble, among many others." Any of those companies would have a keen interest in Mrs. Kerry’s husband’s policies as president.   Already Kerry's economic proposals seem tuned to serve his wife's economic interests. His proposal last March to end tax breaks for U.S. corporations that do business overseas was designed with a loophole that would let the H. J. Heinz Company — the centerpiece of Mrs. Kerry's family fortune — keep its overseas tax breaks, and get a lower domestic tax rate at the same time.   Voters of both parties should demand immediate and full disclosure of Teresa Heinz Kerry's holdings and tax returns. There is ample precedent: In 1984 the husband of Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro made his tax returns public in response to pressure from voters. Today the stakes are greater in every way. Mrs. Kerry’s disclosure should be no less.

       Today Show July 14, 2004   Laura Bush talked about the advice she's given her daughters, speculation her husband should replace Dick Cheney as his running mate and what she thinks of the Democratic ticket. But the interview started with the subject of Iraq. In light of the Senate's highly-critical report on prewar intelligence, does her husband have any regrets?   Laura Bush:  “You know, I just don't think you can regret that Saddam Hussein's no longer in power. We know he had weapons of mass destruction. We know he used them against his own people. The world is safer. It's safer with a democracy being built there in the heart of the Middle East. Is it tough? Absolutely. Have we sacrificed in our country? Absolutely. But we can do hard things.”  It is vintage Laura Bush. Composed, direct and on message.   Even though she likes to joke her husband once promised she would never have to make a political speech, there is no question the first lady has become the campaign's secret weapon — on the trail, charming crowds, ever present in campaign commercials and ready to play political hardball.    Gangel:  “John Kerry is saying, quote, "No young Americans will go to war needlessly if I'm president," implying perhaps that your husband sent …”   Bush:  “Well, John Kerry saw exactly the same intelligence that the president saw. He also voted for the resolution to use force against Saddam Hussein, as did John Edwards. You know, are they sorry that Saddam Hussein's no longer in power? You know, I just wonder if they're sort of stuck because they can't give any credit to anything good that's happened because it would be credit for President Bush.”  She is her husband's staunchest defender, but also brushes aside some recent controversies: On Ron Reagan — the son — addressing the Democratic Convention, supporting  embryonic stem cell research, breaking with President Bush:    Gangel:  “Is this embarrassing for the Republican Party at all?”   Bush:  “No, I don't think so.”   Gangel:  “Do you think he's being used by the Democratic Party?”   Bush:  “Well, I'm not going to say that.”  And on attacks from Hollywood celebrities at a John Kerry fundraiser:   Bush:  “I think they're just part of what happens in a campaign.”   But she's eager to talk about Dick Cheney.   Gangel:  “Your husband was very direct when asked what he thought of John Kerry's vice-presidential pick. John Edwards versus Dick Cheney.”   President Bush had said: “Dick Cheney can be president.”   Gangel:  “What do you think of John Edwards? Do you think that he matches up to Dick Cheney?”   Bush:  “Of course not. Absolutely not.”   Gangel:  “There has been a lot of speculation your husband would have a better chance of winning if he replaced Dick Cheney with someone else. Maybe Colin Powell? Is there any basis for that speculation?”   Bush:  “No.”    Gangel:  “It's not going to happen no matter what?”   Bush:  “No.”  On a personal note, the Bushes are clearly happy to have some new help. Daughters Jenna and Barbara are now out on the campaign trail.   Bush:  “I'm sure she's [Jenna] giving him a lot of advice.”   Gangel:  “Did you give them any advice about this stuff?”   Bush:  “Yes, like stand up straight. Keep your hair out of your eyes. You know, that sort of advice.”   Gangel:  “For so long they didn't want anything to do with politics and you were very good about giving them their private space. What changed?”   Bush:  “Well, they grew up, you know? They're 22 now. They'll be 23 in November. They graduated from college. Jenna actually said to her dad that she didn't want to look back on this last campaign of his and be regretful that she wasn't a part of it.”    Gangel:  “How do they feel about going public. Are they nervous about it?”   Bush:  “They are nervous. They've written introductions of their father that they intend to give at some point when they're traveling with them. But, so far, they felt too unsure of themselves to actually give their introductions. So they're just traveling with him now.”    Gangel:  “They have made their debut in Vogue magazine with a stunning photo shoot. Do you have a favorite photo?   Bush:  “I like the picture of the girls walking in the restaurant in the more casual clothes. I think it's terrific.”  But going public also means the first daughters are giving away some family secrets.   Gangel:  “They say that you love to clean. And they say that their father is very funny with teasing boyfriends. Here's the quote: ‘He's not the shotgun-dad type. He's the joking around to the point where he scares the heck out of them type.’”   Bush:  “He is very, very funny. And he's a lot of fun to be with. And I think even the boyfriends have liked to — you know — like to be around him. And I am clean. I'll admit it. I love to clean. So I was always working on Barbara and Jenna to clean their rooms—with very little success, I might add.”   Finally, Laura Bush says she knows the next four months will be brutal. But that said, the "secret weapon" is ready.   Gangel:  “Do you feel the campaign's already tougher than usual?”   Bush:  “No. Not really. I mean, I think they're always tough, every time. We just forget between elections how tough they are. And I think our children are finding this race very tough as they watch from the sidelines. But when you're in the midst of it, you know, that's what it's going to be. You know that's what politics are like.”   Gangel:  “Goes with the territory?”   Bush:  “It does.”  Expect to see a lot more of Laura Bush. She will speak at the Republican Convention, and expect people to compare her with Teresa Heinz Kerry. In many ways they are very different, but they do share one thing—both have changed parties in their lifetime. Mrs. Kerry used to be a Republican, and a long time ago, Laura Bush, then Laura Welch, was a Democrat.

       Chicago Tribune John McCormick Jul. 12, 2004   This western Pennsylvania city may owe its post-World War II prosperity to steel, but it's the ketchup that made Sen. John Kerry's wife so famously rich.  That wealth has afforded condiment heir Teresa Heinz Kerry and her family a long legacy of philanthropy, something almost certain to help her second husband's appeal in an important section of a key electoral state.  The Heinz name -- now strongly associated with that of the Democratic presidential candidate -- is plastered across numerous high-profile buildings and cultural institutions throughout the city.  There is Heinz Field (home of the Pittsburgh Steelers), the Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, the Heinz Memorial Chapel and the Sen. John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center -- just to name a few.  A recent analysis of public records by the Los Angeles Times showed Heinz Kerry, 65, controls a family fortune worth an estimated $1 billion. If elected, the couple would rank as the wealthiest to occupy the White House.  The Heinz family has long been known for its philanthropy, especially in the Pittsburgh area. It has funded art museums, scholarships, charities, hospitals, literary awards, symphonies, women's health programs and more.  Boosting his ties to the area, Kerry has spent several weekends during the campaign on the estate his wife owns northeast of the city. The Massachusetts senator also announced his running mate, Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, at a rally in downtown Pittsburgh last week.  The $4 million property, one of five homes the couple own across the country, includes a nine-room Colonial and a carriage house. It is where Heinz Kerry raised her three sons and where she is registered to vote.  Pointing to the loss of steel and industrial jobs, Heinz Kerry seemed to mention the charitable work her family has done for the area as she posed on the wooded estate for the first family portrait of the new Kerry-Edwards political clan last week.  "It's been 20-plus years now, almost 30, that people in this area have been hit by loss of jobs," she said. "We have worked very hard here to try to turn this place around."  The Mozambique-born matriarch went on to point to several political battlegrounds that she also views as needing the help Pittsburgh has received from charities and public investments. "America is full of places like the Ohio Valley, Youngstown, West Virginia," she said.  Heinz Kerry's first husband, Republican Sen. John Heinz, died in a 1991 plane crash. He had served in the Senate since 1977 and was a member of the House for three terms before that.  At the regional history center that bears the Heinz name, there are only a few mementos from his political career, one being a campaign bumper sticker that features his name printed in ketchup red.  Still, half of a floor in the museum is devoted to Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co., a major employer and a company with more than 130 years of history here. Ketchup bottles line several displays as visitors enter the exhibit.  The company's story began in 1869, when 25-year-old H.J. Heinz began selling horseradish to grocery stores in the Pittsburgh area. Four years later, he started making ketchup.  The young entrepreneur anticipated that an increasingly urban nation would welcome the convenience of ready-made products. "Many women appreciated the ease of simply opening a bottle of sauce or a crock of preserves," the exhibit states.  By the time of H.J. Heinz's death in 1919, the company was one of the largest food processors in the nation, selling condiments, sauces, pickles and preserves around the world.  The exhibit also lets visitors in on the secret of how the "57" in the "Heinz 57" name was selected. There were more than 57 varieties of condiments at the time, but H.J. Heinz simply liked the number's sound.  Today, the company makes more than 4,000 varieties. Although the bottles don't carry the Kerry name, around here they might as well.

       AP July 14, 2004   The Democratic National Committee has released its lineup of the big-name politicians speaking at the convention this month, and it contained every major Democratic star except one.   There were Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, near the top of the list. Al Gore was there, too, and so was Ted Kennedy. Even the wife of the Iowa governor made the cut. But Hillary Rodham Clinton, the junior senator from New York and one of the most prominent names in the party, was nowhere to be found.   That caught the attention of many Democrats -- including people close to Hillary Clinton -- who wondered why the party had not invited one of its best fund-raising draws, a former first lady who packs a room like few others in her party.   It is not exactly clear why Clinton was not on the list. According to the Kerry-Edwards campaign, the answer was simple: She did not ask to speak, while other officials did.   "She never asked," said Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for the Kerry campaign. "Obviously, Hillary Clinton is a leader in the party and is working hard to elect John Kerry." But Cutter said she did not know whether each speaker, including Clinton's husband, had formally requested time.   Other Democrats had different theories.   Some wondered if the Kerry-Edwards campaign was worried about being upstaged by a woman who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, most likely in 2008. Others speculated that the campaign was worried that Clinton may be too polarizing a political figure to showcase during an event intended to appeal to the broadest political audience.   The speculation about Clinton's political future has heated up since Kerry's announcement last week that his running mate would be John Edwards, the youthful and charismatic senator from North Carolina.   Many Democrats say the decision means Edwards could present a powerful alternative to Clinton in 2008, if Bush wins this year.   Some Democrats wondered whether this potential rivalry was behind the decision to keep Clinton off the list of convention speakers.   "It's very interesting," said one prominent national Democrat who asked not to be identified because he did not want to provoke either side. "A lot of 2008 presidential politics may be at work here. It certainly gives Edwards a tremendous edge to keep her off the list."   But Peggy Wilhide, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Convention Committee, and Cutter said Clinton would have a role in the convention: She would be part of a special segment featuring all the female senators in the party led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who is the dean of the female senators.   If Clinton felt snubbed, it was hard to tell from a statement her office provided Tuesday. "Sen. Clinton is looking forward to attending what will be a great convention and continuing to work hard to elect John Kerry and John Edwards," said Phillipe Reines, her spokesman.   Democrats say the convention will be one of the most significant events of the campaign for Kerry, particularly because large numbers of voters do not begin focusing on the presidential race until the convention season.   It is intended to highlight what Kerry's advisers want to be one of the main issues of his campaign -- that Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, has the background to lead the nation in perilous times.   Kerry will be introduced by Max Cleland, a former U.S. senator from Georgia who lost two legs and an arm during the Vietnam War.   In addition, Kerry will be joined by some of the men from the Swift boat he commanded in Vietnam.

       BALTIMORE SUN Tanika White July 13, 2004   When Sens. John Edwards and John Kerry posed for a political family portrait last week, their wives, the potential first and second ladies, stood out for blending in.  Elizabeth Edwards wore a plain gray pantsuit and minimal makeup. Teresa Heinz Kerry, her hair humidity-frizzed, sported a blazer with linen pants.  The images that appeared on front pages across the country the following days were sleepily all-American. The "Casual Corner" Edwards and the "Ann Taylor" Heinz Kerry were dressed like your cubicle-mate at work, your next door neighbor, or this week's carpool mom.  O where, O where has Jackie O gone?  "Times have changed," said Dany Levy, editor-in-chief of DailyCandy.com, an e-mail bulletin of style and trends. "There was a time when Americans very much liked having a first lady that they could look up to and aspire to, in a Jackie O sort of way. The spotlight has shifted, I think. First ladies have become more figures of respect. I think it is a move to appeal to every woman, and not make the first lady be sort of an intimidating figure."  No matter the president, vice president or political hopeful, over the years the American public has been drawn to what his wife wears. During a depression, a cold war or a time of heightened terror alerts, the fashion sense of a political wife still means something. It says something about her. It says something about him.  Observers have already had their chance to size up Teresa Heinz Kerry. The outspoken millionaire tends to look the part, albeit in an understated way. She's been spotted in Chanel and cocooned in a pashmina. Still, much of her wardrobe leans more toward the simpler Ralph Lauren, king of high-end American fashion.  Kerry's naming of John Edwards as his running mate brought another wife into the public eye, Elizabeth. From her first photo-op, hand-in-hand with her husband, the style-conscious started in with the scrutinizing - and comparing her, looks-wise, to her handsome husband.  She's plump, with a kind smile, older than he is. Her plain-Jane jackets are a bit too snug. Like many American moms, she's even flirted with - and admittedly failed at - the South Beach Diet.  But in news accounts of both women, personal style has taken a back seat to other aspects of their lives - their family backgrounds, for example, their wealth, their motherhood, their professional accomplishments.  Elizabeth Edwards was herself once a practicing attorney and is a dedicated mom. Philanthropist Teresa Heinz Kerry is, among other things, famous for being heir to the $500 million Heinz Co. fortune.  In this day and age, those things mean more to Americans than what they pull out of the walk-in closet every morning, experts said.  "I've followed all of the candidates and the candidates' wives since January," said Myra Gutin, historian and author of The President's Partner: The First Lady in the 20th Century. "And truthfully there hasn't been that much attention on fashion."  Possibly because there isn't much of it to speak of.  Unlike the ultra-chic Jacqueline Kennedy, who lived in Oleg Cassini, waved to the American public in Chanel and ran errands in Valentino, today's political wives seem stuck in dress-down Friday.  They may be, some observers said, purposefully trying to avoid stealing their husbands' thunder - or worse, embarrassing them.  "I think the wives of political candidates, like doctors, observe the maxim 'First do no harm,'" said Lewis L. Gould, a retired professor from the University of Texas who has edited biographies of first ladies. "If there's a certain amount of modest dowdiness, it's because it's really politically dangerous if you do much else."  Over-the-top fashions or a really awful sense of style can give political opponents and the scrutinizing public too much fodder for fault-finding, Gould said.  "Today's first lady has to deal with an increased public awareness of style and fashion," said image consultant Dianne M. Daniels, noting that no one - especially the wife of a political figure - wants to end up the subject of harsh media criticism for fashion faux pas. "Conservative seems to be the rule."  Presidential hopeful Howard Dean's wife, Judith Steinberg, sparked many water cooler conversations during her five minutes of fame for adamantly refusing to buckle to the pressures of being a candidate's other half - whether the pressure related to her anti-fashion, or her successful medical practice.  Steinberg's work-in-the-yard clothes, limp hair and no make-up made a definite statement: I'm a doctor, not a political appendage.  "Almost all of these women are women who have achieved something on their own," Gutin said. "I think that the expectation might be to have the achievements speak for themselves."  Today's wives of the political powerful are often themselves working women. Coiffed hair and haute couture don't fit into their lives any more than such luxuries would in any one of ours.  But, like it or not, they are undeniably thrust into the public eye. And no amount of family money, professional accomplishments or public favor can protect them from amateur fashion critiques.  Hillary Rodham Clinton - although a high-powered lawyer - still took painful hits about her fashion errors (remember the headband?) and her thick ankles, said Gina Pia Bandini, editor-in-chief of the online magazine FashionFinds.com.  Eventually, despite her credentials, Clinton was forced to change her style. As a governor's wife, Clinton wore thick glasses. On the campaign trail with her husband, she dabbled with those regrettable headbands. Today, as a senator, she has a more classic, professional look - black pantsuits, chic but easy hair.  The makeover comes with the territory.  "The job of first lady does demand that you start to pay some attention to your clothes," Gutin said. "Even someone as venerable as Eleanor Roosevelt had to go to a designer or a dressmaker for her clothes eventually."  Despite the perennial focus on what political wives wear, experts said, most first ladies start out fashion-backward.  "I think Jackie Kennedy was the anomaly," Bandini said. "Basically, first ladies are usually pretty dowdy, though they were better coiffed [than Edwards or Kerry]."  Nancy Reagan, though expensively dressed, still came off like someone's wealthy, overly powdered grandmother. Mamie Eisenhower was frighteningly frumpy, and Mrs. Andrew Johnson smoked a pipe. Lyndon Johnson was a thousand times better-dressed than Lady Bird.  "No one looked at Rosalynn Carter and said, 'Wow! Look at what that lady has on,'" said historian Tim Blessing, from Pennsylvania State University and Alvernia College.  The difference, experts say, is that today's first ladies don't necessarily have to be fabulous, but they do have to be somewhat fashion-conscious.  Hillary Clinton had to sit for a Vogue cover. Laura Bush, never a big shopper, has become buddy-buddy with designer Carolina Herrera and warmed to her fashion advice. Mom-in-law and former first lady Barbara Bush improved her off-the-rack style as well.  "Over time, she shed a little bit of weight. She started to be dressed by Arnold Scaasi. She became a little more up-to-date," Gutin said.  In our nation's infancy, presidents often came from aristocracy, so it was expected that their wives would dress more like princesses than pilgrims.  Today's first wives may warm to the idea of designers and color swatches, but Grace Kelly or Jackie O, they'll likely never be.  "These women are saying, 'Of course I want to look good, but what I do is more important,"' Gutin said.  And besides, Levy said, the wives of Edwards and Kerry - the two latest subjects of style-watchers - are doing their part on the campaign trail just by being who they are.  "These women aren't eyesores or slobs," she said. "They're just your basic upstanding American woman. It says more about the president himself if he's chosen a good woman and not a bombshell. If John Edwards were to be married to an Anna Nicole Smith type ... now that would be something to talk about."  In the end, history-buff Blessing said, first ladies can do little to help a man get into the White House or stay there - whether she's a style icon like Jackie or style invisible like Laura Bush.  "Obviously, a wife can harm a husband whether they're in politics or in business. But can they help them? The answer is: Not a whole bunch," Blessing said. "If a politician is a yahoo, it really doesn't matter how turned out his wife is."

       Chicago Tribune Jeff Zeleny  Jul 13, 2004    The moment the Democratic presidential ticket arrived here on a recent afternoon, Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards embraced their wives, waved to the cameras and walked down the steps of their campaign plane to greet a line of dignitaries waiting on the tarmac.      Elizabeth Edwards went her own way.   For days, she had been shaking hands with strangers. It was now time to set politics aside and find the little girl and boy with pink and blue knapsacks, and through the crowd rushed her children, Emma Claire, 6, and Jack, 4, whom she took by the hand and led away from the commotion.   Democrats believe Elizabeth Edwards' poise and wit will validate the vice presidential candidate and serve as a selling point for swing voters. But Edwards--a former bankruptcy lawyer, teacher and one of her husband's best political guides--bristles when comparisons are drawn to other political wives, insisting she is simply trying to get accustomed to having someone carry her suitcase.   "I'm 55 years old," she said in an interview aboard their campaign plane as it flew from West Virginia to New Mexico. "I lived most of my life out of the public spotlight where it never crossed my mind to model myself after somebody."   The Democratic running mate's lively, down-to-earth wife may offer a complement to Teresa Heinz Kerry, who last week gently referred to Edwards as "Mother Earth." As Teresa Kerry introduced her at a Cleveland rally last week, she noted that Edwards, like her husband and John Kerry, was a lawyer. But she added, "She can talk people-talk too."   Elizabeth Edwards was an accomplished lawyer, but she ended her practice after their teenage son, Wade, died in a 1996 car accident.      Tragic turning point     Neither Edwards nor her husband dwell on the loss or are eager to have it become a campaign story, but it is only through that tragedy that their family portrait can be fully explained. At age 48 and 50, she had two more children, saying it was the only way to bring joy back into their home for her and her husband and their daughter, Cate, 22.   As the Democratic team introduced itself last week, the young Edwards children became an instant attraction. To audiences around the country, Kerry repeatedly told stories about the families' dynamic tableau -- "Jack is the new campaign manager. He's running the show!" -- that stood in sharp contrast to the Republican ticket.   But Edwards said she is determined to guard her children from being used for political advantage through television commercials or too many appearances. Even though John Kerry's references to her young son were touching and genuine, she said, the attention also could be wearisome.   "Yes, I think there are things that are too much," Edwards said. "I kept wanting to say, `I appreciate how much you are attracted to Jack, but Emma Claire is actually standing right here.' Like a normal parent, you have to give them the same attention."   On the campaign trail, no one avoids explaining that Edwards had children at a late age and looks older than her 51-year-old husband. In fact, last week, her husband told a crowd of senior citizens in Florida that her AARP card arrived just before Jack was born. She tells voters her husband is the same person she married him 26 years ago and adds, "To my chagrin, he looks exactly the same."   She does not, however, disclose details about her pregnancies to audiences.   "There are a few things that I don't talk about. I would say that I took hormone shots, but I won't talk about fertility or things like that. It's not ladylike!" Edwards said with a laugh. "I don't want a blow-by-blow of your operation or your things, and I'm not giving you one of mine."   Edwards said that like many Americans she has tried the South Beach diet. While too much attention may be placed on image, she conceded that images are important in a televised political world.   "People make judgments based on appearances, but we spend too much time on it," she said. "To me, the issue has to do with my own personal comfort about whether I'm being self-conscious or whether I can let that part go and not worry about it."   As she stood on stages from Ohio to Florida to New York, she received booming applause from Democrats, who said they found her refreshing, enlightening and inspiring.      Powerful persona     "There's a powerful maternal aspect about her," said Karen Ballard, a nurse in Manhattan who saw Edwards at a fundraising breakfast last week at Pier 94. "She has a real warm personality. She doesn't seemed rushed."   During the Democratic primary, Edwards often traveled by herself on campaign trips and waited for her own luggage at baggage claim. On one flight from South Carolina to Washington, a prominent commentator dressed down a flight attendant for not delivering a cup of coffee. Edwards witnessed the scene and offered a kind word of assurance to the shaken young woman.   Earlier in the primary campaign, Edwards candidly voiced her frustration to strategists that her husband's candidacy seemed to be stuck. One confrontation, according to a former adviser, helped spark new ads emphasizing his optimism and character.   "Elizabeth is very blunt. She does not censor herself," one former aide said. "John really relies on her to know the right thing to do. She's not very political, but she always advises him on what is the right thing to do."      Life-changing moment     As the Edwards family waited to hear who Kerry would select as a running mate, she said she was not as anxious about the choice as the timing.   Then, she said, "What happens of course, is the ball drops, then all of a sudden your world blows up."   With her young children, Edwards said she isn't sure how the fall campaign schedule will unfold. She plans to play an active part, but she said she gave the Kerry campaign one piece of guidance: "Don't feel like you need to have me do something to keep me happy. I only want to do things that make a difference and translate into votes."   A hint of her role emerged last week when she reminded an audience in St. Petersburg, Fla., that she was born in Florida and that her parents and a string of aunts and uncles still live there. It is, after all, one of the biggest battleground states and the place that decided the 2000 election.   While she prefers speaking to small groups, Edwards proved in Raleigh last weekend that she could master a far larger crowd. As thousands of admirers, stretching a block in either direction, shouted that they couldn't hear, she cleared her throat and fixed the problem.   "I'm an old high school cheerleader," she said. "I'm going to see if I can make those fellas in the back hear."   And she did.

       TIME James Carney July 11, 2004   When Elizabeth Edwards was a bankruptcy lawyer in Raleigh, N.C., she spent much of her court time in the "second chair," providing advice and often doing the heavy legal lifting for the lead attorney on a case. Being second chair was less glamorous than taking the lead, and it didn't come naturally to someone so outspoken, eloquent and whip-smart. But it gave Elizabeth what she wanted—more manageable hours and more time to spend with her children. And it was great training for advising her husband through a meteoric six-year rise from political neophyte to vice-presidential nominee. "I feel like I've honed my skills as a sounding board as well as anyone possibly could," Elizabeth said last week. "I try to be effective and honest, someone who tells him when what he's saying doesn't ring true."   If John Edwards can sometimes seem too smooth, too charming, too eager for his own good, Elizabeth, 55, is his antidote. More than just a wife and the mother of his kids, she's the gravitational force that keeps his feet on the ground, the buffer between the man she knows and the political commodity he's become. Early in the Democratic primaries, when the candidate's schedule called for him to perform the photo-op ritual of flipping pork burgers at the Iowa State Fair, Elizabeth nixed the idea as too phony. Later, when she felt the ads produced by her husband's media consultant, David Axelrod, didn't convey who he really was, her objections led to Axelrod's being replaced.   A Navy brat who moved often and spent nine years in Japan, Elizabeth Anania majored in English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was halfway through a Ph.D. program in American literature when she decided to trade in Henry James' The Ambassadors for Black's Law Dictionary. It was at law school, in her civil-procedure class in 1974, that she met John Edwards, a country boy four years her junior. He says he found her "smarter and more sophisticated than I'd ever be." On their first date, he took her to hear a band at a Holiday Inn. "It was not love at first sight," she recalls. But Edwards persisted and won her over with his sunny outlook on life. In July 1977 they married at a small Chapel Hill church with no air conditioning. Despite vastly improved finances, Elizabeth still wears the $11 ring that John slipped on her finger that day, and they still celebrate each anniversary the way they spent the first one: by dining at Wendy's.   For the next 19 years, their life seemed to approach perfection. They had two children, Wade and Catharine; John's career as a trial lawyer took off, making them fabulously wealthy; and Elizabeth managed to juggle her own legal work with the duties she cared about most: attending PTA meetings, shuttling the kids to soccer games and making their Halloween costumes. One year, when Wade and his friends wanted to dress as parts of a golf course, she figured out how to make real grass grow on cardboard. The idyll collapsed in April 1996, when Wade, 16, died in a freak car accident.   Both parents were devastated, but Elizabeth had the hardest time coping with her grief. She quit work, changed her surname to Edwards (she had kept her maiden name at marriage) and stayed home, finding numbness, if not comfort, in watching the Weather Channel with the sound off. Eventually, she and John plunged themselves into creating memorials to their son, including the Wade Edwards Learning Lab in Raleigh.   Elizabeth has said they decided to try to have more children to bring joy back into their home. It wasn't easy, but through intensive fertility treatments—the details of which she declines to discuss—she got pregnant. Elizabeth was 48 when Emma Claire arrived; she gave birth to John "Jack" Atticus at 50. However, she is by no means eager to be a spokeswoman for those trying to push the limits of reproductive biology. She was lucky, she says: "I don't want women to think, She did it at 50; so can I. It's extremely difficult to have children at a later age."   If her husband becomes Vice President, Elizabeth's first job will still be raising her kids. But she'll venture into issues, especially education. As one Edwards adviser puts it, "She has the smarts of Hillary Clinton and the charm of Tipper Gore." Friends say she would bring a refreshing lack of pretension to her new life. "She never puts on airs," says Washington pal Bonnie LePard. "In fact, sometimes she doesn't even put on shoes." (Elizabeth, LePard explains, once joined a campaign strategy meeting at her home barefoot and dressed in overalls.) Mostly, though, she would continue to be her husband's top adviser, second chair to his lead.

       Newsweek Melinda Henneberger      Wouldn't you just know," Elizabeth Edwards says with a rueful laugh, that her son Jack would choose the moment of the big Kerry-Edwards family portrait last week to stick his thumb in his mouth for the first time—a moment captured for posterity in a rather large photo on the front page of The New York Times. "He never even did that as a baby! So now mothers across the country think I let my 4-year-old suck his thumb!''   By all indications, however, mothers across the country can also relate. At campaign stops, women in particular mention approvingly how "real'' Elizabeth is. They like that she looks like a regular mom, not a supermodel, and admire that she went on to have two more children—she had Emma Claire at the age of 48 and Jack when she was 50—after their older son, 16-year-old Wade, died in a freak highway accident in 1996.   At a rally in West Virginia on Friday, Sharon Rockefeller, the wife of West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, introduced Elizabeth this way: "She connects to real people. She has book smarts and she has street smarts, and she has a lot of common sense, too. She cuts to the chase.'' Elizabeth doesn't seem to feel she has to hide the book smarts, either, and pays audiences the rare compliment of assuming that "real'' people can be moved by poetry.  Addressing the crowd in West Virginia—while standing on tiptoes so she can reach the microphone—she speaks with quiet, articulate passion, and quotes from a favorite poem by Seamus Heaney: "History says, Don't hope on this side of the grave. But then once in a lifetime, the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme.'' Edwards and Kerry can be that wave, she promises, "the kind of wave that brings a ship to shore.''   Mary Elizabeth Anania Edwards was a Navy brat who moved around a lot as a kid, and met her husband in law school at the University of North Carolina. He is several years younger than she, and came from a more modest background, yet they were alike in the ways that mattered, she has often said, and she fell in love with his sweetness and almost limitless sense of the possible.  They married the Saturday after taking the bar exam, and she went into bankruptcy law, getting settlements for small-business owners, mostly. Eventually, though, she cut her hours back to part time so she could be home with Wade and their daughter Cate (who recently graduated from Princeton) in the afternoons. She quit practicing law altogether after Wade died—not as a retreat from life, but to support her husband's new career in public service and to mother their new children. "We wanted to reintroduce joy into our lives, not replace Wade,'' she says simply.  The Edwards and the Kerrys, who live only a block apart in Georgetown, do seem to be having fun together on the road. When John Kerry sits down across the aisle from Elizabeth on the campaign plane and sees that she's giving an interview, he shouts, "You go, girl!" Teresa Heinz Kerry says that when the four of them are together for dinner, there's "a lot of irreverence around the table. She's so smart, very warm and also knows how to survive tough challenges.'' Heinz Kerry's first husband, Republican senator H. John Heinz III, died in a plane crash.  Elizabeth often speaks of "parenting Wade's memory'' by trying to make a difference in the world, as he would have wanted. And Heinz Kerry says, "I understand that because I do the same thing with Jack's memory ... Having the two babies is another affirmation, and I admire that, too. If I had a 'Farmer in the Dell' life I would have liked to have tried to have a baby with John'' Kerry, whom she married at 55, she says, then laughs at her wistfulness. "But at some point, the shop is closed!''  Describing the day Edwards was chosen as Kerry's running mate, Elizabeth says, "I had a hair appointment, and the hair guy was so nice to come and do my hair at my house, so while I have color on I run upstairs and throw underwear in a bag.'' As she's talking, an attendant on the plane comes by with the dessert tray. Does she want a brownie? "The answer is yes,'' sighs Elizabeth, who is on the South Beach diet. "But if you go away I'll be happier in the long run."

       AP July 11, 2004    Teresa Heinz Kerry -- wife of presidential candidate John Kerry -- is coming to Idaho.  She's the guest Saturday at a Ketchum fund-raiser hosted by former U-S ambassador to Belgium Alan Blinken and his wife, Melinda.  Blinken says Heinz-Kerry has funded many programs in the Wood River Valley -- including the Galena Lodge emergency medical service training. And he says she's been an enormous supporter of the hospital in Blaine County.  Blinken says the presidential candidate will not attend the luncheon. John Kerry last visited Idaho in March.

       AP 7/11/2004    Lynne Cheney, the vice president's wife and mother of a lesbian, said Sunday that states should have the final say over the legal status of personal relationships.    That stand puts her at odds with the vice president on the need for the constitutional amendment now under debate in the Senate that effectively would ban gay marriage.   "I think that the constitutional amendment discussion will give us an opportunity to look for ways to discuss ways in which we can keep the authority of the states intact," Cheney told CNN's Late Edition.   The Senate began debate Friday on an amendment that defines marriage as a union of a man and woman as husband and wife.   Supporters acknowledge the proposal is endorsed by only about half the Senate, well short of the two-thirds needed to approve a change in the Constitution. Still, a vote would put lawmakers on the spot in an election year as they seek to balance backing traditional marriage and gay rights.   Cheney has two daughters, both of whom are working in his campaign. The Cheney's gay daughter, Mary, is director of vice presidential operations for the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. She held a public role as her father's assistant in the 2000 campaign and helped the GOP recruit gay voters during the 2002 midterm elections.   She has been less visible this year while traveling with the vice president or working at campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va. As the election nears, she will play a more public role, campaign aides say.   President Bush said in his weekly radio address Saturday that legalizing gay marriage would redefine the most fundamental institution of civilization. A constitutional amendment is needed to protect marriage, he said.   During the 2000 campaign, vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney took the position states should decide legal issues about personal relationships and that people should be free to enter relationships of their choosing.   When Massachusetts' high court ruled last year that gay couples are entitled to wed, the issue became a very hot political topic. Republicans hope it will take votes away from the Democratic presidential ticket.   Both Bush and Cheney have voiced their support this year for the proposed constitutional amendment. Their Democratic rivals, Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, oppose the amendment.   The Democrats also oppose gay marriage, but defend a gay couple's rights to the same legal protections as those conferred in marriage.   Asked Sunday about her husband's stand on gay marriage in 2004, Lynne Cheney said, "I thought that the formulation he used in 2000 was very good.   "First of all, to be clear that people should be free to enter into their relationships that they choose. And, secondly, to recognize what's historically been the situation, that when it comes to conferring legal status on relationships, that is a matter left to the states," she said.   Lynne Cheney said the situation in 2004 is somewhat different from the one four years ago because of the Massachusetts court ruling and its effect on states.   Asked again about the difference between the Democrats and the Bush administration on the amendment, Cheney reaffirmed her preference for local solutions.   The vice president's press office had no immediate comment Sunday.   ( urlLink read the transcript  of wolf blitzer's interview with mrs. cheney)

       The Christian Science Monitor  Gail Russell Chaddock  July 12, 2004      Dressed in basic beige, with wash-and-wear hair and toddlers in tow, Elizabeth Edwards could be the average suburban mom - except that she's not.  Some analysts suspect she may be sharper than anyone on the presidential ticket. As a law student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Elizabeth Anania dazzled classmates, including future husband John Edwards, with her intelligence, humor, and grit.   A classmate recalls watching Elizabeth stop a professor cold after a 20-minute grilling on a case. "The goal was to humble her, and it didn't happen," says Glenn Bergenfield, an attorney in Princeton, N.J. John Edwards, seated a few rows behind the "raven-haired beauty," took note. They were married the weekend after both completed bar exams.  Now, as her husband's closest adviser, she defends his public image as sharply as she once defended herself: No goofy hats (or helmets), no stock shots of dancing at campaign events, and no "trophy" wife. Mr. Edwards describes his wife as his conscience. "The smartest lawyer I know is my wife, Elizabeth," he says.  Yet few women in public life have mastered the art of gentle self-deprecation as effectively as Mrs. Edwards, who calls herself the "anti-Barbie," and also, "a window to John."  Married to one of America's most successful trial lawyers, Mrs. Edwards could dress at the level of her bank account. Instead, she drives herself about town, carries her own bags, and chuckles about the time she had to duck into a thrift shop to replace a stained blouse before a campaign event. It's a personal style that fits a campaign anchored in John Edwards's life story of hardworking textile families in tough times. It also fits a job requirement of the wife of every American vice president: Don't upstage the first lady.  "It is important that the first lady and wife of the vice president get along publicly, and that is not always the case," says Craig Schermer, historian at the National First Ladies' Library in Canton, Ohio.  Elizabeth Edwards and Teresa Heinz Kerry have many life experiences in common, from a cosmopolitan childhood to sudden tragic losses: Mrs. Edwards lost a son, Wade, in a traffic accident in 1996; Heinz Kerry lost her first husband, GOP Sen. John Heinz, in a plane crash in 1991. Both see themselves as "sounding boards" in their husbands' campaigns.  Some political insiders say that Heinz Kerry's regard for Mrs. Edwards was a factor in the decision to choose John.  "She's an amazing woman.... She's suffered loss, and she didn't drown with it," Heinz Kerry said on an interview with CNN's Larry King Live last week.  But there are also differences. While Heinz Kerry speaks her mind on a wide range of subjects, from public policy to botox and her pre-nup agreement with John Kerry, Mrs. Edwards makes a point of keeping the focus on her husband.  "Elizabeth Edwards is extremely skilled, and clearly knows politics: She knows what to say and what not to say," says Larry Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia, who recently introduced her at an event at the University of Virginia law school. "We're seeing more and more professional women who happen to be married to men who are in politics. They're learning to avoid the minefields that Hillary Clinton stepped in," he adds.  Both Heinz Kerry and Mrs. Edwards make a point of saying they do not intend to make policy along with their husbands - a clear reference to Hillary Clinton's high-profile role in managing healthcare reform in the Clinton administration's first term.    In many ways, Elizabeth Edwards's story is as compelling as her husband's. Her decision to have two more children, after the death of her son, speaks to the high value of family in her life.  "Elizabeth and I were 30 and 26 when our first son Wade was born, and it is a glorious fact that Elizabeth was 50 when she had our beautiful son Jack," writes Edwards in his book, "Four Trials." Daughter Emma Claire is 6; daughter Cate recently graduated from Princeton.  The eldest daughter of a decorated Navy pilot who flew missions over North Korea and China, Elizabeth spent her childhood on the move, living in Japan, Florida, and Washington. It's one reason she so values home and family life, friends say. Her father, known for once flying an unarmed cargo plane like a fighter jet to avoid incoming MiGs, could hold a room with his stories, often hilarious. It's a talent Elizabeth shares.  "From the time she was a toddler, she was extremely impassioned, blazingly intelligent," says her brother, Jay Anania, now a New York film director. He recalls that while other kids sang cartoon theme songs, she would sing "Summertime," in perfect pitch.  But he adds that her capacity to excel at anything was not without effort. During a recent trip to Florida to help their mother, Elizabeth worked all through the night, while the family slept. "She says rest is an overrated activity," he says. "I thought she would be the one who was tired, but at the end, it was me."  After law school, Elizabeth practiced bankruptcy law and volunteered for community activities such as the PTA. The Edwardses' Raleigh home was a neighborhood hub, with Elizabeth holding court, friends say. Teenagers liked talking to her, especially around a box of warm doughnuts from Krispy Kreme, the unofficial state food. (An aide reports that she used to buy them for Wade's soccer games, hot from the oven, and always brought a box for the other team.)  Family note that she always talked to her children like adults, without the $10 words. "No matter how young they are, she still speaks to them like adults, as in: 'You're responsible for putting this back here. You know that, and the reason is, if you don't, some one else will have to,' " says Mr. Anania. "She loves being a mother. It's a role that she esteems more highly than any other, despite the fact that she is extremely active in other things."

       AlterNet Liz Cox Barrett June 16, 2004   Outspoken. Wealthy. Powerful.  These are the adjectives de rigeur in any news profile of the 65-year-old wife of Senator John Kerry, as one press outlet after another this spring weighs in on the momentous question: Teresa Heinz Kerry, burden or asset?  Heinz Kerry is hardly the first recipient of this kind of attention. Virtually every auditioning First Lady in recent decades has been the focus of this media-manufactured debate. During the 1992 presidential campaign, the media made hay over the so-called "Hillary Factor," as opponents of Bill Clinton waxed eloquent about the perils of admitting an independent, successful woman with an activist bent into the White House's East Wing.  This year, it is Heinz Kerry's turn.  As a prominent and successful woman, she's the kind of political wife that draws heightened scrutiny during a political campaign. "It happened to Geraldine Ferraro's husband, to Hillary Clinton, to Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife," says Cliff Shannon, the former chief-of-staff for Senator John Heinz. It may explain why Laura Bush got off relatively easy. She recently told USA Today, "I don't think I got as much attention when we ran last time as [Heinz Kerry] has." And she's right. The last two women to vie for first spouse, Bush and Tipper Gore, had both long since left their careers -- as a librarian and a photojournalist, respectively -- by the time they hit the campaign trail in 2000.  No current career, one less stone for political opponents to unturn.  Hillary Clinton's liberal activism was the focus of Republican attacks in 1992; this year, it is Heinz Kerry's philanthropic work. She is the chair of the Howard Heinz Endowment and the Heinz Family Philanthropies, and a board member of the Vira I. Heinz Endowment, reportedly overseeing assets of over one billion dollars.  Leading the attempts to give her the "Hillary treatment" thus far is the Capital Research Center (CRC), a conservative, Washington-based organization that studies the spending of nonprofits. Grant Oliphant, who served as Senator John Heinz's press secretary and is now executive director of the Heinz Endowments, says that the CRC has "aggressively tried to drum up interest in the notion it would be a conflict of interest to be an active philanthropist and also be First Lady."  In April, CRC published a report titled "The Heinz Foundations and The Kerry Campaign" which concluded ominously:    The United States has never had a wealthy spouse overshadow its president. But Teresa Heinz Kerry leads and funds philanthropic foundations and she sits on the board of directors of highly political nonprofit groups that receive her foundations' support and that can advance or frustrate the policies of her husband, should he become president. That's unprecedented political power. More public scrutiny of Heinz Kerry's public role is in order. While there is still time.   The reality is that people on both ends of the political spectrum have publicly lauded Heinz Kerry for her philanthropic activities in western Pennsylvania. According to the Boston Globe, her foundations have poured nearly $200 million into an array of environmental causes, including large sums for cleanup projects in western Pennsylvania and a riverfront park in Pittsburgh -- all of which have helped turn that region into an environmental model for the rest of the nation.  Oliphant, who served as Heinz Kerry's speechwriter and spokesman, is confident that attempts to paint her as an out-of-control liberal will fail, if only because of her Republican background. "Teresa comes out of a Republican past, she believes strongly in fiscal responsibility and sort of a more open approach to social issues which was consistent with moderate Republicanism for a long, long time," he says.  Contrary to what the CRC may claim, Heinz Kerry's strong support for the environment is not part of her liberal agenda but dates back to her days as a Republican senator's wife, when she reportedly helped persuade John Heinz to support the 1990 Clean Air Act. In fact, Heinz Kerry was a registered Republican until January 2003. And when her first husband died in a plane crash in 1991, she considered making a run to fill his seat.  Myra Gutin, a professor of communications at Rider University in New Jersey and the author of a book on first ladies, says, "I found it fascinating that [Heinz Kerry] seemed to be a rather popular Republican wife when she was married to John Heinz. And now she's being painted as somebody ... a little bit out there, somehow untrustworthy."  Republicans have at times gone to ludicrous lengths to distort the image of an opponent's wife in the past. During the 1992 presidential campaign, conservatives "found an old article [Hillary had] written for a law journal years before in which she said in certain cases children should be emancipated. They translated that into [saying] she was anti-marriage, anti-children." Gutin has no doubt that Heinz Kerry's words and actions will be the target of such creative interpretation.  Apart from attacks by her husband's political adversaries, every potential First Lady also has to grapple with the caricatured persona the media creates for every major player in an election cycle. With Heinz Kerry, journalists seem to have zeroed in on her tendency to be "candid" -- or alternatively blunt, outspoken, or impolitic. "[Teresa] is forthright in sharing her opinions. She really doesn't believe in beating around the bush," says Oliphant. "In our culture which purports to want all of those things for public figures it's supremely ironic to me that whenever someone like that comes along they get the daylights beat out of them for just those attributes."  According to conventional press wisdom, her candor combined with her seeming foreign-ness (she was born in Mozambique and speaks Portuguese-accented English) makes her seem a little, well, different, which could be a thorn in her husband's side. Take, for example, Newsweek's title of its May 3rd cover story: "Is John Kerry's Heiress Wife a Loose Cannon or Crazy Like a Fox?"  Heinz Kerry has tackled the criticism head-on, often pointing out to reporters that being outspoken is seldom viewed as a disadvantage in men. She also told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that as an immigrant she relishes her freedom to be open in her adopted country:   If you say 'speaking your mind,' it can sound like I'm coming out to make a point. But if you say 'enjoying your freedom.' it means I can say something without going to jail or losing a job. I think that's something that the press misses when they say, 'She's too frank, or she's too honest.' I'm enjoying that. I'm enjoying the freedom.  Oliphant sees three factors at play in the negative attention received by women in politics, particularly potential first ladies, today. "The first thing that's changed -- and I'd say Hillary was the first to really be the victim of it -- there are no limits anymore in terms of political attacks," he says. Next is the Internet, according to Oliphant, which makes it easy to launch disinformation campaigns against political foes.  Finally, there is our culture's ambivalent relationship with powerful women. Much like Hillary Clinton, Oliphant says, Heinz Kerry "is willing to stand up for things she believes in, speak out for things she believes in and she has strong credentials as a professional and wants to be taken seriously even if she's the president's wife." An expert on women in politics who did not want to be quoted by name, agrees: "Women who are strong leaders and a little out of the mold or role, it's like: target. [Teresa's] in a very contentious environment, so it's going to be no-holds-barred."  However, while the CRC will undoubtedly continue to call for "more public scrutiny" of Teresa Heinz Kerry, any attempt to give her the "Hillary treatment" will be that much more difficult, if only because her admirers include conservatives like Shannon. As he puts it, "She's smart, complex, has a lot of resources, and to her credit has spent the larger part of her life either raising three good children or devoting herself to causes she believes in. If that's a signal of evil, well, then I say may we have more of it."

       TRIBUNE-REVIEW Karen Roebuck July 10, 2004    Elizabeth Edwards, wife of the presumptive Democratic vice presidential nominee, is no stranger to the Pittsburgh area.  In fact, Edwards and her family used their grandmother's home on Wallingford Street, Oakland, as a permanent address and visited often while they moved to Japan, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and Washington D.C. during their father's naval career.   So it was especially significant when Democratic presidential contender John Kerry -- whose wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, owns an estate in Fox Chapel -- chose Pittsburgh to announce the selection of U.S. Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina as his running mate, said Jay Anania, a filmmaker and New York University professor and brother of Elizabeth Edwards.   "It has such resonance in our family, so it was especially nice. It just felt very appropriate for us," he said.   "I never lived there, but I visited millions of time," Anania said. "All of our cousins grew up there -- the group of cousins we were closest with."   Edwards' father, Vincent Anania, was born in 1922 in Brownsville, Fayette County, and spent part of his childhood in Oakland. He attended the University of Pittsburgh, playing offensive and defensive end on the football team, until he transferred to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1942, according to his son.   Elizabeth Edwards was named after her mother. Elizabeth Anania, 80, also the daughter of a Navy pilot, met her husband in Pensacola, Fla. The couple have three children, Edwards, 54, Jay, 53, and Nancy Sims, 52, who lives in Bradenton, Fla.   Anania served 32 years in the Navy and retired as a captain. His son said he received numerous medals, including the Bronze Star and Distinguished Flying Cross, the highest peace-time flying award given for an act of heroism.   Flying over Russian air space in the early 1960s, Chinese MiGs shot and severely damaged his plane, but he managed to land safely back in Japan after flying just 12 feet over the ocean, according to his son.   The elder Anania, 82, no longer able to talk after suffering a stroke 12 years ago, lives in South Florida with his wife.   "He was the most loquacious, hilarious, physical, fun machine," his son said. "It's too bad (he can't talk), because he could tell great Pittsburgh stories. He just loves, loves, loves Pittsburgh ... Whenever he talked about it, he just glowed."

       The Dallas Morning News Colleen McCain Nelson March 18, 2004   When John Kerry came down to breakfast at the St. Regis hotel, he found his wife and her girlfriends in a fit of giggles.  "We have fun on the campaign trail," Teresa Heinz Kerry told him. "You work, but we have fun."   The woman who never wanted any part of a presidential campaign says she is surviving life on center stage with a little help from her friends.   "I told John, you could take your friends with you to campaign," she said. "I've just figured out how to enjoy this."   As she criss-crosses the country, Mrs. Kerry is coming to terms with the role of political spouse.   The chairwoman of the Heinz family's philanthropies, Mrs. Kerry is accustomed to being the boss. But she's been panned for her candor, as pundits debate whether she's a political asset or simply impolitic.   "I have opinions because I run a big foundation," she said in an interview. "I'm chairman. In that sense, leading, you have to be persuasive. You have to have ideas."   During the early days of the campaign, she shared her thoughts on everything from Botox (good) and prenups (necessary) to Wal-Mart (bad for small towns) and infidelity (punishable by maiming).     Honest or offensive?     Such freewheeling comments have become infrequent, and Mrs. Kerry says that she would not contradict her husband's policies publicly. But she said it is her frankness that appeals to the voters she calls "folk."   "I think people feel empowered and encouraged by honesty," she said. "Folk want thought and inspiration."   Being blunt likely will yield mixed reviews, said Myra Gutin, a professor at Rider University in New Jersey who teaches a class about first ladies.   "Some are impressed and will be supportive of honesty," she said. "But such candidness could be offensive to some."   To be sure, the campaign trail has been rocky at times. Headlines have questioned whether she is an asset or an Achilles' heel.   Mrs. Kerry shrugs them off, comparing headlines to midriff-baring mini-skirts.   "They're trying to attract attention," she said. "What can you do?"   Ultimately, though, questions about Mrs. Kerry aren't likely to have much impact on the election, Dr. Gutin said. "In the end, we vote for the candidate," she said.   Mrs. Kerry never sought the spotlight that comes with a presidential campaign.   Raised in Mozambique and fluent in five languages, she came to the United States to marry John Heinz, heir to the Heinz family fortune, now valued at $550 million. The moderate Republican was later elected to the U.S. Senate from Pennsylvania.   Teresa (pronounced teh-RAY-zah) Heinz quashed any presidential aspirations her first husband might have had, saying "over my dead body."   Mr. Heinz introduced his wife to the junior senator from Massachusetts in 1990. A year later, Mr. Heinz died in a plane crash.   She married Mr. Kerry in 1995, but she didn't immediately warm to a presidential bid.   She was a registered Republican until her husband launched his campaign, and she only recently started using his name.   Mrs. Kerry, whose chestnut hair and olive skin belie her 65 years, said she looks forward to a life after politics. But she is committed to helping Mr. Kerry defeat President Bush.   She keeps her own schedule of nearly non-stop campaign events, crossing paths with her husband only occasionally. Mrs. Kerry said life on the road has been bearable because of her friends.   "I'll be in the front seat, trying to do an interview, and they're in the backseat trying to distract me," she said, laughing as she re-enacted the scene.   During this stop in Houston, two of her friends are wandering the halls of the St. Regis while Mrs. Kerry does interviews and prepares for a fund-raiser. Decked out in jeweled "Kerry 2004" pins and cracking jokes in French and English, the women have no trouble entertaining themselves.   "J'adore Texas!" one announces.   "It's never dull," Mrs. Kerry said later.   Some of her buddies affectionately call her Dr. T - a nod to her maternal manner and concern for their heath. And Mrs. Kerry credits her friends with providing the laughs along the way.     Serious endeavor     Still, politics is a serious endeavor. And Mrs. Kerry earnestly addresses questions, speaking in paragraphs, not sound bites.   In the early going, events were confined to small-town coffee shops and public libraries in Iowa and New Hampshire. Now, she and Mr. Kerry play to larger crowds in made-for-TV events.   "I want to keep the quality of intimacy of a sort, of close thinking, drawing people in," she said. "If I went to listen to somebody, and I was considering whether or not to vote for them, I would want to know how they think more even than their positions."   Mrs. Kerry knows her life would change as first lady. But she said the position would provide her a microphone to discuss the issues she focuses on in her philanthropic work: protecting the environment, improving education, providing economic opportunity and promoting the arts.   She declines to compare herself with first ladies past and present, saying that she does not know Laura Bush personally but adding that they have a mutual friend who speaks highly of Mrs. Bush.   "Probably in another world we would have been friends," Mrs. Kerry said.   She admires Hillary Rodham Clinton's intelligence and focus. "If she'd been a man, I think she would have been president before Bill Clinton," Mrs. Kerry said.   She has no plans, though, to emulate Mrs. Clinton or any of the women who came to the White House before her.   "I think you just have to be who you are," Mrs. Kerry said. "One just hopes that one is strong enough to remain who one is and become what one is supposed to become."   Mrs. Kerry is settling into the role.   "I always had visions when I got to be 65, I would be doing ... trips that I never had done that I'd like to do," she said. "And now I'm 65, and I'm doing this. This is my trip. And it's a great trip, but it's not what I had envisioned."

       BBC News Online  Kathryn Westcott  27 January, 2004      Journalists love Democratic front-runner John Kerry's wife Teresa. The flamboyant, multi-million dollar heiress of the Heinz food empire has delighted commentators but rattled the nerves of campaign managers.   "Outspoken" is a word that is most commonly used to describe the 65-year-old.   She has spoken candidly about using Botox, prenuptial agreements, and said she would "maim" any husband who was unfaithful, adding jokingly that she "might be into 18-year-olds".   In November, she described the Democratic debates as a silly waste of time.   But Teresa, along with the other First Lady nominees, can only expect the attention to intensify as campaigning heats up.   "The First Lady provides a context into how you evaluate the president," Lewis Gould, who is currently editing a series of books on modern First Ladies, told BBC News Online.   "The spotlight begins to apply itself to every detail of the potential presidential family, so issues of how the children are raised, what the potential first lady does, the background and heritage all come into play."     Emphasis on marriage     All the Democrat wives, with the exception of Howard Dean's spouse Dr Judith Steinberg, have spent a significant amount of time on the campaign trail. They are playing the ultimate supporting role in a presidential campaign well, by letting voters know that they are standing behind their man.   But if Mrs Heinz Kerry's outspokenness has proved controversial, keeping quiet can be equally testing.   Dr Steinberg has incurred the wrath of many for shunning the campaign trail. Her preference for concentrating on her work as a GP has been criticised for defying tradition.   Many people see her as a role model for independent women who balance careers and children, while feminists applaud her refusal to be reduced to an adjunct of her husband.   But, most commentators conclude that her absence could be a possible liability to her husband's chances.     Gert Clark has played a more traditional role of political spouse    "Americans want First Ladies to have an independent life, be their own person but at the same time, they want them to defer to the idea that presidential elections are the most important thing that we do as a nation every four years. A candidate's family should be eager to participate. When Dr Steinberg said she didn't want to campaign, she was pushing the envelope as far as the autonomy of the First Lady goes," says Mr Gould.   "This reflects the ambivalent attitude Americans have about the role of women in society still and the additional assumptions about their inferiority."     Flexible     However other First Lady scholars believe there is scope within the role of the First Lady for ambitious and independent-minded women to prove themselves.   Myra Gutin, who has taught a course on First Ladies and written books on the subject, believes Dr Steinberg may not have given the institution as much credit as it is due.   "We've never had a professional First Lady before. Dr Steinberg says she would like to continue practising as a doctor if her husband became president. It would be difficult but I think it could be done," she told BBC News Online.   "There is no First Lady mould - it is a position that can accommodate anyone. Since Eleanor Roosevelt, we had the most active first lady in Hillary Clinton and now we have Laura Bush, who is one of the least active."   Hillary Clinton, a lawyer, gave up practising when her husband became president. Nonetheless, her White House work is widely seen as having prompted a backlash against her.   Her unpopularity with many Americans was not because she was active, Ms Gutin says. It was because she crossed the line and was active in areas of public policy.   "A First Lady can be active in the things that we might think of as more traditional feminine concerns. For example Lady Bird Johnson was interested in environmentalism and Roslyn Carter with mental health.   "The role of First Lady is not a stifling role - a woman in that position has to do with the job whatever she wants. Laura Bush has specific interests in education and literacy but has not gone as far as she could have done in promoting them."   Ms Gutin says she believes Ms Heinz Kerry is the sort of person who would seize the podium afforded her by her office to carry out a lot of good works.   Ms Heinz Kerry has devoted herself to overseeing and revamping the billion-dollar Heinz family endowments and has been described by the New York Times as one of America's leading philanthropists.   She has been showered with awards for her efforts on behalf of the environment, education, women, children, health issues and the arts.   In a recent interview, Ms Heinz Kerry criticised people who had asked her what existing model of First Lady she would follow if her husband's political ambitions were successful.   "I'm going to be me," she said. "I will continue to do my work. Just because a woman is a spouse she shouldn't be expected to look one way or act one way.   "I'm surprised sometimes that in America, a liberated country, we expect the wife of a president of the United States to be, in essence, a modern chattel. It's not right."

       VEJA Roberto Pompeu de Toledo 18/02/04   "Pronuncia-se Tuh-ray-za." Assim a revista Time ensinou a seus leitores como dizer o nome da mulher do senador John Kerry, o provável adversário de George W. Bush nas eleições presidenciais americanas deste ano. Sigamos as instruções da revista. O "tuh" da primeira sílaba, na boca de um americano, soa mais ou menos como "tã". O "ray" da segunda equivale a "rrrrei", pronunciado com aquele "r" inglês que rola na língua antes de dar lugar à vogal que o acompanha. "Za" é "za" mesmo. Temos então que o nome da referida senhora deve ser pronunciado Tãrrrreiza. Vá lá: aceite-se, tendo em vista as limitações da língua e do palato de um americano. Mas nós outros sabemos que não é bem assim. O nome dela é Teresa. E Teresa é Teresa, três singelas sílabas que devem ser entoadas sem medo, sem "ãs" ou "eis" a entravar-lhes o fluxo, leves, alegres e soltas como bandeiras ao vento.            A Teresa em questão é uma grande figura. Talvez mais ainda que o marido, é a grande personagem da atual temporada eleitoral – uma personagem cuja história, entre outros lances marcantes, tem Moçambique e molho de ketchup em seu caminho. Teresa nasceu Maria Teresa Thierstein Simões Ferreira, em Lourenço Marques, cidade que seria rebatizada Maputo quando o país de que é capital, Moçambique, se tornou independente. Observe-se de passagem, para atentar agora em aspectos de grafia, que na imprensa americana Simões é Simoes e Lourenço é Lourenco, além de Moçambique ser Mozambique. Cedilha e til não fazem parte do repertório local, o que impede a apreciação de Teresa em toda a sua justa e complexa dimensão. Só quem tem til no nome e nasceu num lugar com cedilha sabe o que isso significa.            Teresa nasceu numa rica família portuguesa, e cresceu em meio aos impulsos contraditórios de uma confortável vida entre os colonos brancos, de um lado, e a penúria da população circundante, de outro. Estudou na África do Sul e na Suíça. Na Escola de Intérpretes de Genebra, foi colega de Kofi Annan, hoje secretário-geral das Nações Unidas. Mas esse não foi seu encontro mais importante. Maior foi o encontro com o ketchup, ou melhor, com John Heinz, dono do ketchup, dos picles e da maionese que levam seu nome. Teresa, que fala cinco línguas e queria ser intérprete da ONU, acabou no mundo das conservas, que no caso da marca Heinz também não deixam de ser multinacionais, e apresentadas em variados idiomas: casou-se com seu proprietário. Ei-la milionária. E, logo, ei-la também mulher de senador. John Heinz, eleito pelo Estado da Pensilvânia, exerceu o mandato até morrer num desastre de avião, em 1991.            Atenção para o lance seguinte. Não bastassem o nome Teresa, Moçambique, a cedilha e o til, agora é o Rio de Janeiro que entra nesta história. Na Eco 92, a conferência ecológica realizada na capital fluminense em 1992, Teresa se aproxima do segundo senador, e segundo John, da sua vida. Senador John Kerry. Militante ecológica, ela veio à conferência como representante de ONGs americanas. Kerry veio como político interessado em questões ambientais. Três anos depois, casaram-se.            Não se imagine Teresa no papel de mulherzinha de político, como Laura Bush se esforça para alardear que não é, mas é. Segundo alguns próximos, ela foge de tal modelo ainda mais do que Hillary Clinton. Sua independência calça-se, em primeiro lugar, numa fortuna de 500 milhões de dólares, herança do primeiro marido, em segundo em sua ativa gestão à frente de uma das maiores organizações filantrópicas dos Estados Unidos, os fundos Heinz destinados a causas sociais, calculados em 2 bilhões de dólares, e em terceiro lugar em sua personalidade forte. Teresa tem opiniões. É católica e a favor do aborto. Defende com paixão causas ecológicas, educacionais e assistenciais. E, aos 65 anos, além de bonita e divertida, conserva-se atenta aos truques femininos. Aplica Botox, conforme admite sem vacilar. E numa entrevista, quando lhe perguntaram o que faria se o marido a traísse, respondeu que não o mataria. Não. "Eu o mutilaria." Já se vê que John Kerry pensará duas vezes, caso uma Monica Lewinsky venha a cruzar-lhe o caminho. Sobre o governo Bush, ela o qualifica como "o mais cínico, o mais venal e o mais maquiavélico" que lhe foi dado conhecer, em seus 32 anos de Washington.            Teresa, ou melhor, John Kerry, é mais do que um candidato. É o chefe de um movimento de libertação. O agente da luz em quem estão depositadas as esperanças de destronar o cavaleiro das trevas que se entocou na Casa Branca. Tanto melhor que, a seu lado, tenha Teresa. Para nós, em caso de vitória, isso significará uma primeira-dama que fala português. É a língua do "ão" forçando a porta da Casa Branca. O til e a cedilha pedindo passagem. De quebra, é o Rio de Janeiro a figurar, na memória do casal presidencial, como berço de sua história de amor. Alguma coisa isso deve valer. Sem falar que os povos de língua portuguesa seremos os detentores da verdade sagrada, indivisível e indiscutível de que Teresa é Teresa, não Tuhrayza.

       Courier Des Moines Bureau TODD DORMAN   First lady Laura Bush said Wednesday she intends to take a more active role in her husband's re-election effort as the campaign trail brought her to western and central Iowa.  "I think people know me better than they did," Bush said during a stop at Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines. "I do enjoy it. I like to be with people and politics is a people business."  The first lady toured a children's health center and touted the "Reach Out and Read" program. The effort enlists pediatricians to stress the importance of reading to children and to provide books to their young patients at check-ups.  She also read aloud to a group of 4- and 5-year-olds from the hospital's employee daycare center, surrounded by TV cameras, bustling aides and tight security.  "Did you like it?" Bush asked after reading "I Love You Little One," eliciting a chorus of "yes" from the children. "Yeah, that was sweet."  Bush also stopped in Council Bluffs, where she visited a public library. And she attended at a private Republican Party fund-raiser in Omaha, providing yet another sign of her more active political role. So far, the first lady has helped raise more than $5 million for President Bush's re-election drive.  Unlike four years ago, Laura Bush plans to spend the next few months campaigning apart from the president. This weekend she will make a series of stops in New Hampshire and Boston.  "I've been very busy and I'll continue to be really busy," said Bush, who expects a close race in Iowa and nationally.  "It's tough. We'll be working very, very hard. As you remember, the last race was also close and evenly divided and I think that's just a fact of life right now in American politics," she said.  But the first lady had little to say about her husband's rivals after Democratic hopeful John Kerry tapped U.S. Sen. John Edwards to be his running mate Tuesday.  "As you all might guess, I'm solidly for Bush-Cheney," she said.  Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, is taking a high-profile role in her husband's White House bid. Heinz Kerry campaigned in Iowa a week ago.  And although there will be presidential and vice presidential debates, Bush rejected the idea of a first lady debate.  "I just don't think that's actually necessary," Bush said.  Bush said she already is engaged in a national duel with Heinz Kerry over cookie recipes, with the first lady's oatmeal chocolate chunk cookie matched up against Heinz Kerry's pumpkin spice cookie recipe. Family Circle magazine readers will pick a winner.

       NEW YORK TIMES Sheryl Gay Stolberg  Thursday, July 8, 2004   America got a fresh glimpse of Elizabeth Edwards and witnessed a thoroughly modern breed of political wife.  She appeared steady and solid Wednesday in taupe pantsuit and sensible heels. When her husband, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, made his debut as a vice presidential candidate on national television, it was Elizabeth Edwards, looking the middle-aged mom that she is, who held together the family tableau, maintaining a firm grasp on the hand of their 6-year-old daughter, Emma Claire, to prevent the little girl from twirling about and wrecking the photo opportunity.  "That is the real Elizabeth," said Tricia Arnett, one of her good friends. "Her most important job in the world is mother, and she's probably the most unpretentious person I know. I think you saw that coming through today."  But at 55, Elizabeth Edwards is much more than the mother of John Edwards's children. Smart, blunt, hilariously funny, she is a professional woman in her own right and also her husband's most trusted political adviser - Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton rolled into one. Like Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Edwards has been a successful lawyer; she practiced bankruptcy law until 1996, when the Edwards' son, Wade, died in a car accident at age 16. Like Barbara Bush, she shows her age more than her husband does, and is not afraid to say that it irks her when people remark on how much younger he looks.  And like Nancy Reagan, she is fiercely protective of her husband's image, so much so that when John Edwards's media consultant, David Axelrod, did not live up to her exacting expectations during the senator's bid for the Democratic nomination, a new image-maker was brought in to advise him. Elizabeth Edwards correctly understood that her husband's sunny optimism was his greatest political asset, Axelrod said, and she was determined that voters see it.  "There is no doubt that she was very involved in the process and that she had a very strong proprietary sense of how John Edwards was going to be presented," he said. "There's no doubt that she and I had our moments, but I came away from it with great respect for her."  On Wednesday, in the first public appearance of her husband's campaign for the vice presidency, Elizabeth Edwards kept her remarks brief and to the point. She and John Edwards and their three children, Cate, 22, Emma Claire, and Jack, 4, had spent the night at a farm outside Pittsburgh that belongs to John Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry. "Any endeavor that starts in an environment like this has got to have the wind at its back," Elizabeth Edwards said, as the two families stood side by side in the lush green hills. "I feel completely confident about this race."  On the campaign trail, she lends a kind of gravitas to her husband; John Edwards's advisers say voters give him credit for choosing a partner who seems so down to earth and to have coped so well with the death of a child. And women who have had trouble conceiving are well aware that Elizabeth Edwards, who began having children again in her late 40s, had fertility treatment to begin her second family.  Unlike her husband, whose rags-to-riches story is well known, Mrs. Edwards, born Elizabeth Anania, grew up in a sophisticated middle-class family. The eldest of three children, she spent much of her childhood moving back and forth between Japan, where her father, a navy pilot, was stationed, and the United States. She met John Edwards in law school at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  As her husband became a successful trial lawyer in North Carolina, Elizabeth Edwards practiced law, eventually cutting back her hours to part-time. But when Wade died, she withdrew from work entirely. She found a way out through Internet support groups and charitable work.  As to how she will juggle the demands of motherhood and the campaign trail, friends acknowledge it will be difficult. The family rule, said Ellan Maynard, a friend, is that one parent is home at all times. But on Wednesday, that rule was broken, and probably not for the last time.  The New York Times WASHINGTON America got a fresh glimpse of Elizabeth Edwards and witnessed a thoroughly modern breed of political wife.  She appeared steady and solid Wednesday in taupe pantsuit and sensible heels. When her husband, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, made his debut as a vice presidential candidate on national television, it was Elizabeth Edwards, looking the middle-aged mom that she is, who held together the family tableau, maintaining a firm grasp on the hand of their 6-year-old daughter, Emma Claire, to prevent the little girl from twirling about and wrecking the photo opportunity.  "That is the real Elizabeth," said Tricia Arnett, one of her good friends. "Her most important job in the world is mother, and she's probably the most unpretentious person I know. I think you saw that coming through today."  But at 55, Elizabeth Edwards is much more than the mother of John Edwards's children. Smart, blunt, hilariously funny, she is a professional woman in her own right and also her husband's most trusted political adviser - Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton rolled into one. Like Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Edwards has been a successful lawyer; she practiced bankruptcy law until 1996, when the Edwards' son, Wade, died in a car accident at age 16. Like Barbara Bush, she shows her age more than her husband does, and is not afraid to say that it irks her when people remark on how much younger he looks.  And like Nancy Reagan, she is fiercely protective of her husband's image, so much so that when John Edwards's media consultant, David Axelrod, did not live up to her exacting expectations during the senator's bid for the Democratic nomination, a new image-maker was brought in to advise him. Elizabeth Edwards correctly understood that her husband's sunny optimism was his greatest political asset, Axelrod said, and she was determined that voters see it.  "There is no doubt that she was very involved in the process and that she had a very strong proprietary sense of how John Edwards was going to be presented," he said. "There's no doubt that she and I had our moments, but I came away from it with great respect for her."  On Wednesday, in the first public appearance of her husband's campaign for the vice presidency, Elizabeth Edwards kept her remarks brief and to the point. She and John Edwards and their three children, Cate, 22, Emma Claire, and Jack, 4, had spent the night at a farm outside Pittsburgh that belongs to John Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry. "Any endeavor that starts in an environment like this has got to have the wind at its back," Elizabeth Edwards said, as the two families stood side by side in the lush green hills. "I feel completely confident about this race."  On the campaign trail, she lends a kind of gravitas to her husband; John Edwards's advisers say voters give him credit for choosing a partner who seems so down to earth and to have coped so well with the death of a child. And women who have had trouble conceiving are well aware that Elizabeth Edwards, who began having children again in her late 40s, had fertility treatment to begin her second family.  Unlike her husband, whose rags-to-riches story is well known, Mrs. Edwards, born Elizabeth Anania, grew up in a sophisticated middle-class family. The eldest of three children, she spent much of her childhood moving back and forth between Japan, where her father, a navy pilot, was stationed, and the United States. She met John Edwards in law school at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  As her husband became a successful trial lawyer in North Carolina, Elizabeth Edwards practiced law, eventually cutting back her hours to part-time. But when Wade died, she withdrew from work entirely. She found a way out through Internet support groups and charitable work.  As to how she will juggle the demands of motherhood and the campaign trail, friends acknowledge it will be difficult.

       WASHINGTON, June 17, 2004 CBS Dotty Lynch    Teresa's Pumpkin Spice vs. Laura's Oatmeal Chocolate Chunk. Cookies are the latest gimmick in campaign '04. Family Circle magazine started a First Ladies' Cookie competition in 1992 after Hillary Clinton's famous proclamation about not being a wife who sat at home and baked cookies and had teas.   Some homemakers were outraged and Hillary had to eat crow and bake cookies to prove her feminine bona fides. One nice thing about the 21st century is how far we've come on the cookie front and how neither Laura nor Teresa has to apologize for baking or not baking cookies or for being themselves.   In a delightful interview with CBS News' Byron Pitts this week, Mrs. Heinz Kerry showed her outspoken, playful and very charming stuff. At 65, she would be the oldest first lady in U.S. history, and with net assets of $500 million from her late husband, she is a modern-day Martha Washington. After a Washington Post style section piece last year that included some very frank statements by Heinz-Kerry, pundits had a field day predicting she would demolish the campaign. However, so far she has been a trooper, slogging through the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire and generating more awe than shock.   She appeared in the Kerry campaign's $25 million bio-ad buy referring to her husband as having "generosity of spirit." Kerry adviser Tad Devine said he was blown away by the off-the-cuff phrase. "We would never have come up with a line like that," he said.   Laura Bush is also appearing in ads with her husband and has her own spots on education on the Web. This week, she's off campaigning solo at rallies in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Minnesota and talking issues. Mrs. Bush is the strong, sweet type who, with her smile and confidence, seems to keep her rambunctious husband and daughters in line. Where Teresa provides a wild earthiness to the reserved Kerry, Laura is the one who tames the more spontaneous Bush.   There are those who thought Laura Bush would be a throwback to the pre-Hillary years, when a wife knew that her place was in the East, not the West, wing of the White House But Laura Bush has carved out a role of her own. She has traveled abroad and has said she wants to go to Afghanistan and Iraq. She also seems a tad more moderate than her husband on social issues, although last week she gave interviews to all the networks opposing – nicely, but firmly – Nancy Reagan's position on using embryonic stem cells for medical research. .   Both the Bush and Kerry campaigns have strong women at the top. Karen Hughes, who unapologetically left the president's side to relocate her family back to Texas, will be back full time in August. Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill is a tough-as-nails Mother Superior. She runs the campaign with a firm hand and has her troops terrified of speaking to reporters without authorization. The communications departments of both campaigns are headed by women: Nicolle Devenish for Bush-Cheney and Stephanie Cutter for Kerry. None of these women appear to have much time for baking right now, but talk wistfully about making time for real life later on.   Donna Brazile, Al Gore's campaign manager in 2000, is so comfortable about cooking that she named her memoirs "Cooking With Grease, Stirring the Pots in American Politics." And each chapter begins with a recipe or meal that is a political metaphor. Her chapter titles – Garlic Grits, Jambalaya, Smothered Chicken and Stuffed Po' Boys – give the book texture and spice without being cutesy. "Chapter 14. Dirty Rice: Louisianans like their rice and their politics the same way – colorful and dirty. I didn't realize just how down and dirty the electoral process could become…."   You get the drift.   Brazile is gutsy and her book describes hard times and tough battles inside campaigns, as well as against Republicans. She is a hardball pol as well as a nurturing woman, and her book is a reflection of both.   Women still have a way to go in politics but the past few years have seen a new mold evolve. These gals don't want to be called cookie, but they don't mind baking them and letting the world know they enjoy it.

       Alexander Bolton THE HILL   The selection of Sen. John Edwards (N.C.) as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee has swelled the budding rivalry between him and Sen. Hillary Clinton (N.Y.), who is believed by many to be eyeing the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008.   Observers, including those close to Edwards, say that his place on the ticket has secured a political future that had been endangered by his decision earlier this year to retire from the Senate to focus on his White House bid.   But Clinton’s allies, while enthusiastic about Edwards’s selection and the possibility of knocking President Bush out of office, say Edwards will have no discernible advantage in a future Democratic presidential primary should the Kerry-Edwards ticket fall short of victory.   The former first lady has eschewed discussion of the impact of Edwards’s spot on the ticket on her own political ambitions.  In a statement released yesterday, Clinton declared: “I am excited by John Kerry’s selection of Senator John Edwards as his running mate. I have worked with Senator Edwards for years, including our efforts together to improve healthcare and to strengthen AmeriCorps, and I know him as a tireless advocate for middle-class America.”  Political analysts say Edwards will likely be Clinton’s chief adversary, and vice versa, in the 2008 or 2012 Democratic presidential primary, assuming that New York’s junior senator decides to fulfill the dream of running for president that many political observers ascribe to her.   “This choice sets up a very interesting Democratic presidential primary down the road between Hillary Clinton and John Edwards,” said Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown University. “Whoever is the vice-presidential choice becomes one of the top favorites in the following election, whether it be in 2008 or 2012.”   Ross K. Baker, a Rutgers University professor of political science, said a contest between Clinton and Edwards “would be a battle of two of the Democrats’ most incandescent personalities.”  Steve Grossman, who served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1997 to 1999, described Edwards as one of the few politicians who can match the luminosity of the Clintons.  “It was December 1, 1998,” Grossman said, recalling a time shortly after Edwards was elected to the Senate and Clinton’s husband, then the president, attended an event. “We had a big fundraiser in D.C. and Edwards was expected. … The door opens [and Edwards walks in] and in a room with the president of the United States, John Edwards lit up the room. It was as if an incandescent bulb walked in the room.”   Among Sen. Clinton’s most partisan critics, Grover Norquist, a conservative activist close to Bush, crowed that Edwards’s selection as the running mate would hamper Clinton’s anticipated future presidential bid.   Norquist said Kerry has “just told [other] Democrats that the presidency is a closed shop for at least eight or 12 years.”  “Edwards will have a leg up,” Norquist said. “Hillary will have to claw through him.”  But Paul Begala, a senior political adviser in the Clinton White House, said Edwards would not receive much of a boost for 2008 if Bush prevailed in November.  “Losing is not good,” said Begala. “Losing is bad. [Sen.] Joe Lieberman [D-Conn.] was on the ticket that got more votes [than the winning Bush-Cheney ticket], and it didn’t do any good the next time around.”  Yet Begala was enthusiastic about the selection of Edwards and Democratic prospects for winning back the White House, as were other Clinton allies.  “I think it’s a terrific choice,” he said. “It sends a message of optimism and energy and a focus on the future.”  Steve Jarding, who formerly headed Edwards’s leadership PAC, New American Optimists, offered a different analysis of what the vice-presidential nomination would mean in future political battles.   “This clearly elevates him,” said Jarding. “There was some question if he wasn’t running for reelection and he wasn’t on the ticket, how do you keep his star rising.”  “Now that he’s on the national ticket, that gives him a forum [to stay in the public spotlight] well into the future,” he added. “This is a guy whose future is established because of this selection.”  But Jarding said he did not envision Edwards and Clinton as adversaries. “Whether they should meet down the road, that’s certainly possible,” he said. “Rather than being adversaries, they will complement each other as advocates for change.”   During the one full election cycle that both Clinton and Edwards have served in the Senate, from 2001 to 2002, they developed a rivalry as two of the biggest fundraisers in the Senate Democratic caucus.   Clinton edged out Edwards by raising $3.3 million through her leadership PAC, HILLPAC, while Edwards raised $3 million through New American Optimists. Their leadership PACs far outpaced those of all other Senate Democrats, except for that of then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (S.D.), who raised $3.28 million through DASHPAC.  Nevertheless, her spokesman, Philippe Reines, said, “Senator Clinton has been working hard for John Kerry’s election, and will do whatever she can between now and Election Day to make him the next president.”  Melanne Verveer, who served as Clinton’s chief of staff when she was first lady, agreed, and said she herself was enthusiastic about Edwards’s selection.  “I know she’s going to work really, really hard for the ticket,” said Verveer, who acknowledged Edwards’s political strengths — which Clinton herself is sure to weigh as she contemplates her political future.  “He brings a lot of energy to the ticket,” said Verveer. “He’s a very attractive campaigner. He proved himself to be quite formidable during the campaign process. His theme of two Americas when the middle class is contracting and not expanding is very compelling.”  As for whether Clinton, who will turn 65 before Election Day 2012, would be too old to pursue the presidency should Kerry-Edwards triumph, Verveer said, “We just had the Ronald Reagan example fresh in our minds, and he wasn’t a young man when he ascended to the presidency.”

       Shannon Augustus CNSNews.com   The selection of North Carolina Sen. John Edwards as the Democratic vice presidential running mate sparked more curiosity Tuesday about the political future of former first lady and current New York Sen. Hillary Clinton.  According to Clinton's former press secretary Karen Finney, the former first lady was never interested in being Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's running mate. "She said it fairly consistently," said Finney. "She has been very consistent on that. She was fairly consistent about not running in '04, and then she didn't run in '04."   Dr. Mahmood Monshipouri, professor of political science of Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, believes that Mrs. Clinton is interested in the presidency but will run only when the time is right.   "I don't believe she is not interested in the position. She is interested in politics. She enjoys politics. She probably calculated and became convinced that this is not the right time to run," Monshipouri said.   He added that Mrs. Clinton may have seen the war on terrorism as a discouraging factor to mounting a candidacy this year.  "She felt like if she gets in this race then her hands will be tied up in terrorism, and that will put enormous pressure on the way she wants to run the country," Monshipouri said, adding that Clinton wants to run a country where she can "shift the debate from foreign policy to domestic policy."   There is growing speculation about whether Mrs. Clinton wants Kerry to win this year's presidential election because of the fact that a Kerry win in 2004 would almost certainly eliminate her as a candidate in 2008.  But Finney said the New York senator "is happy to do whatever it is John Kerry will ask of her in terms of campaigning to support the ticket." She said Mrs. Clinton is a devoted senator and, for the time being, is focused only on serving the people of New York.   "She is as excited as all Democrats today about the announcement of John Edwards added to the ticket. And I know she is committed to serving her time in the Senate and representing the people of New York State. That is what she said she's been committed to doing and that is what she's been doing," said Finney.   But Hillary Clinton's political future is unlikely to be limited by her job on behalf of the Empire State, according to Monshipouri.  "By being senator from the state of New York, I think she has intentionally given the impression that she wants to stay at the center stage of American politics," he said. "I see her right in the thick of the American politics. She will always work on an opportunity to step in when the time is right, according to her calculations," added Monshipouri.

       Revista VEJA Alexandre Oltramari  24/05/2004     Nos oito anos em que seu marido governou o país, a antropóloga Ruth Cardoso, 73 anos, deixou duas marcas: o empenho com que manteve sua vida pessoal e familiar longe dos holofotes e o afinco com que levou seu trabalho à frente do Comunidade Solidária, o principal programa social do governo tucano, no qual conquistou o respeito até de adversários políticos. Nesta entrevista, a primeira que concede desde que deixou Brasília, Ruth fala sobre sua vida pessoal na época do governo, a rotina num palácio e o papel de uma primeira-dama - termo, aliás, que ela detesta - e critica a política social do governo do PT, que julga assistencialista e permeada por uma visão estatista. Depois de uma temporada de um ano em Washington com o marido, Ruth voltou ao Brasil há pouco mais de dois meses. Seu tempo, agora, é dividido entre os netos e o comando da Comunitas, uma ONG voltada para a área social. No escritório da Comunitas, em São Paulo, a ex-primeira-dama recebeu VEJA por duas horas e deu a seguinte entrevista.    Veja  - O presidente Lula foi criticado por dar à primeira-dama, Marisa Letícia, uma sala no Palácio do Planalto, embora ela não tenha função no governo. O que a senhora acha disso?  Ruth  - O problema não é a sala. É a conduta. Ela está fazendo algum jogo que não deveria? Até agora eu não soube de nenhuma interferência. A primeira-dama não foi eleita, não recebe salário, não é parte do processo político. Apesar disso, tem um papel importante, com alguma influência. Umas têm mais, outras menos.    Veja  - Por que a senhora não gostava de ser chamada de primeira-dama?  Ruth  - Acho um americanismo desnecessário. Isso começou nos Estados Unidos e agora está virando moda até na França. Mas não faz parte da nossa tradição. Ninguém nunca se lembrou de chamar de primeira-dama dona Sarah Kubitschek, que ocupou espaço num governo com grande visibilidade. Lá nos Estados Unidos, tem um significado tradicional. Aqui, não. Mas, como o termo já foi introduzido, agora não adianta reclamar.    Veja  - A atual primeira-dama costuma acompanhar o presidente num grande número de eventos públicos. No plano simbólico, qual é a importância disso?  Ruth  - Deve haver alguma. Mas eu sempre tive mania de trabalhar. Sempre tive muita coisa para fazer. Tinha todas as minhas atividades, que me tomavam muito tempo. Precisava viajar para avaliar as ações do Comunidade Solidária. Estive presente em todas as situações em que se supunha que a presença da primeira-dama fosse importante. Mas isso tudo diminuiu muito no mundo. No início, durante as reuniões presidenciais, todas as mulheres acompanhavam o marido. Com o passar do tempo, isso mudou. O fato é que há uma diferença de estilo. Não se pode comparar Danielle Mitterrand, que tinha uma ONG na qual criticava o governo do próprio marido, com madame Chirac, que no início não tinha muita participação política, mas depois chegou a disputar uma eleição.    Veja  - A vida longe do poder é menos emocionante?  Ruth  - Voltamos a ter a vida que sempre tivemos. Vou ao supermercado, freqüento restaurantes, concertos, teatros. Faço tudo o que fazia antes. A idéia de que vivíamos num mundo mágico não é verdadeira. É muito agradável voltar a ter mais liberdade e privacidade. Mas eu não gosto quando se faz um corte assim. Parece que saímos do Olimpo e voltamos para o mundo real. O presidente da República não é um rei. Brasília faz parte do mundo, sim. Quando chegamos ao Palácio, sabíamos que um dia sairíamos de lá. Há um mito sobre esse assunto. Até porque o Alvorada possui uma ala privada. Tínhamos uma vida em família. Não jantávamos no salão de banquete quando estávamos apenas os dois.    Veja  - Não é complicado viver em um palácio?  Ruth  - É muito simples. Está tudo ordenado. Há quem organize as cerimônias, você sabe onde tem de ficar, o que precisa fazer. É verdade que às vezes é um pouco repetitivo. Mas tivemos a oportunidade de conhecer pessoas muito interessantes.    Veja  - Fernando Henrique já disse, em tom de brincadeira, que sente falta apenas da piscina do Palácio da Alvorada. A senhora sente saudade de quê?  Ruth  - Sabe que ele continua repetindo isso? Eu também gostava da piscina, mas não é nada que me faça falta no dia-a-dia.    Veja  - A senhora, que sempre foi muito ciosa da privacidade pessoal e familiar, não acha natural que haja curiosidade popular sobre a vida dos governantes?  Ruth  - Não. Essa esfera não interfere na vida pública. Defendo arduamente a distinção entre a esfera pública e a esfera privada. Lutei durante todo o tempo em que nós estivemos nessa posição pública para que se preservasse a vida privada. No Brasil, respeita-se pouquíssimo isso. A diferença entre nós e os americanos é que eles, ao elegerem um governante, acreditam piamente que estão escolhendo também o homem, o cidadão, o pai de família. Isso faz parte da mitologia americana. O Brasil não é assim. Quando uma coisa é grave, ela acaba se tornando pública naturalmente.    Veja  - Em parte pelo discurso do PT, em parte pela biografia do presidente Lula, imaginava-se que a área social seria o ponto alto do atual governo, mas não é isso que vem ocorrendo. O que aconteceu?  Ruth  - A pergunta deveria ser respondida pelos petistas. Foram eles que criaram uma expectativa e ainda não encontraram uma maneira de devolvê-la aos brasileiros.    Veja  - Mas qual é o principal obstáculo?  Ruth  - Existem algumas premissas quando se fala em política social. A primeira é parceria. Isso precisa ocorrer em todos os níveis. Com o governo, com a sociedade civil, com as universidades. A concepção do PT é estatista. Nela, o Estado tem de fazer todas as coisas. Eu já acreditei nisso no passado. No mundo contemporâneo, no entanto, a coisa não funciona assim. A visão estatista dificulta muito. Temos um arsenal de gente que conhece, que vivenciou, que tem experiências novas que precisam ser aproveitadas. A sociedade brasileira não é amorfa nem apática, como se costuma descrever. Nem o Brasil tem um número tão grande de pobres que os impeça de ser mobilizados. Minha experiência mostra que sempre que abrimos qualquer possibilidade, no lugarejo mais afastado, as pessoas respondem. O governo não pode fechar os olhos para essa realidade.    Veja  - Quando o presidente Lula convoca os brasileiros a acabar com a fome, ele não está propondo justamente isso?   Ruth  - O caminho é esse. A mobilização existe. A resposta é positiva. A questão é se o governo está criando parcerias. Se está aproveitando os recursos humanos que aí estão. Ou se está agindo como um grande mobilizador de uma idéia, não de um fazer. Recolher dinheiro e produtos não é parceria. Parceria é a definição de um objetivo comum. Não existe parceria sem descentralização. Está faltando combinar isso. Hoje, falta um diálogo no qual os parceiros tenham igual possibilidade de interferência. Falta avaliação, falta prestação de contas, faltam objetivos comuns. Não pode existir fórmula pronta. Políticas assistencialistas não têm diminuído a pobreza.    Veja  - A política social de Lula é assistencialista?  Ruth  - O Fome Zero, que foi o que apareceu no começo do governo, era extremamente assistencialista. Distribuir alimentos não sustenta o desenvolvimento de ninguém. Mas depois houve algumas mudanças. Não tenho informações detalhadas para avaliar. Aliás, acho que faltam informações para todos os brasileiros. Informações sobre como essas ações estão se desenvolvendo. Hoje, não tenho como avaliar, embora ache que deveria ter. Até porque é preciso avaliar os programas enquanto eles estão sendo desenvolvidos. Não adianta, no fim de um programa, dizer se ele foi ruim ou bom.    Veja  - Existe um problema de gestão na área social do governo ou houve apenas uma expectativa exagerada por se tratar de um governo do PT?  Ruth  - A expectativa não pode ser usada para explicar tudo. Agora, até a economia se aproximou da psicologia. Tudo na economia agora virou questão de expectativa. Veja que, com relação à política econômica, havia uma expectativa negativa em relação ao PT. Mas os petistas tiveram a visão necessária para perceber que o Brasil não pode viver isolado. Por isso, ainda que tivessem um discurso diferente, mantiveram o rumo adotado no governo passado. No caso das políticas sociais, talvez eles ainda estejam reexaminando a questão, adaptando-se à realidade. Não é fácil governar. O PT já aprendeu bastante e ainda está aprendendo muito. Eu gostaria de uma definição mais clara sobre a maneira de fazer as coisas. Há pessoas muito preparadas no PT, mas há problemas.    Veja  - Que problemas?  Ruth  - Eles estão partidarizando demais a máquina pública. Isso é criticável. É muito grave. É claro que o partido precisa dar o rumo do governo. Mas na Europa, por exemplo, a burocracia pública é muito enraizada. E muito consciente de seus deveres. Há um controle para que as pessoas possam saber se ela age com o rigor e a independência necessários. Isso é fundamental para o desenvolvimento democrático de um país. No Brasil, porém, o PT partidarizou a burocracia além do limite.    Veja  - Na última década, sobretudo durante o governo de Fernando Henrique, passou-se a gastar mais com os pobres e surgiu uma grande variedade de programas descentralizados. Mas nada disso reduziu a desigualdade. Por quê?  Ruth  - A desigualdade está aumentando no mundo todo. No Brasil, já era imensa, inaceitável. Precisamos reduzi-la, não há dúvida. Mas essa meta não pode ser alcançada rapidamente. Até porque, se existe uma herança maldita, é a desigualdade de cinco séculos. Não podemos medir isso de um ano para o outro. A melhor maneira de combater a desigualdade é a educação. Mas para aumentar a escolaridade média da população brasileira, que é imensa, leva-se dez anos.    Veja  - Com os dois mandatos de seu marido, a senhora está entre as primeiras-damas mais longevas do país. Qual o papel de uma primeira-dama?  Ruth  - Primeira-dama é um ser humano, não é uma Barbie. Não podemos ter um modelito que sirva para todo mundo. Assim como não existe modelo para presidente, não pode existir modelo para primeira-dama. Cada uma desenvolve o trabalho para o qual se sente mais apta.    Veja  - Uma primeira-dama desfruta uma posição privilegiada para influir em decisões do presidente da República, não?  Ruth  - Eu não tinha poder algum. Não fui eleita para nada, como qualquer primeira-dama. Tinha apenas uma posição privilegiada para conseguir apoios e firmar parcerias na área social. Sempre me mantive totalmente afastada do governo. Nunca participei de reunião com ministro nem com ninguém da área governamental. Aliás, há exemplos de crises conjugais muito sérias por causa disso. Basta lembrar o ex-presidente da Argentina Carlos Menem e o ex-presidente do Peru Alberto Fujimori, cujas mulheres, em algum momento, tentaram interferir politicamente. Aí dá problema.    Veja  - A senhora discutia sobre o governo com seu marido?  Ruth  - Muito pouco. Tínhamos tão pouco tempo juntos que esse não era o nosso tema preferido. Ele me contava sobre suas dificuldades e idéias, mas eu nunca tive interferência no governo. Quando havia coisas que eu sabia, porque tinha estudado, dava minhas opiniões. Mas governar não é levar em conta a opinião da mulher nem a do assessor. As avaliações e as escolhas são muito mais complexas. É por isso que governar é tão difícil.    Veja  - O que a senhora acha da possibilidade de seu marido se candidatar ao Palácio do Planalto em 2006?  Ruth  - É um problema dele, mas acredito na resposta que ele vem dando quando é perguntado sobre o assunto. Primeiro, que essas coisas não são definidas de antemão. Depois, que ele acha que já deu sua contribuição e que agora é a vez de outras pessoas. Um dos grandes problemas do país é a dificuldade de criar novas lideranças. Isso acontece em todos os partidos. O fato de um ex-presidente dar uma opinião já o transforma em candidato. Tudo vira um jogo eleitoral.    Veja  - A senhora já pensou em disputar uma eleição?  Ruth  - Não. Estou contente com o que já fiz. Sempre participei ativamente, com posições claras. O que eu sei fazer melhor é fazer as coisas acontecerem.    Veja  - É uma crítica aos políticos?  Ruth  - Não. Só acho que não estou apta a fazer política partidária, assim como os políticos não estão aptos a fazer o que eu faço.

       USA TODAY  Judy Keen and Richard Benedetto  June 30, 2004        Laura Bush never really was just a demure librarian.     In private, she has always been more independent and opinionated than the docile public persona she perfected for her husband's first presidential campaign. But a more confident, glamorous and outspoken first lady is now on display for what she wistfully notes will be her final campaign.   The Betty Crocker hairdo has been replaced by a sleek coif with streaks of blonde. Her toenails, peeking out from comfy espadrilles, are bright red. She still prefers to talk about education and reading, her pet issues and avocations, but she can dish up justifications for the war in Iraq, too.   In May, she exchanged quips during an appearance on The Tonight Show. When Jay Leno asked if she had gambled or seen a Chippendales show during a stop in Las Vegas, she replied with a version of the city's advertising slogan: "Jay, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."   She conducts solo news conferences when she's traveling and parries with reporters who challenge her husband's policies on controversial issues. Her voice is so soft, it's hard to imagine her yelling. But there is steel in her tone when she dislikes a question.   Reminded in an interview that a favorite reporting technique is to press her to define differences between her views and those of President Bush, she asks, "Is that what you're going to try to do? 'Would you please get into a debate with your husband? He doesn't have to debate John Kerry; he can just debate you!'"   The meek spouse caricature was always off base, says Regan Gammon, a friend since they were 8 or 9 years old. "Somebody must have said, 'Well, she's quiet, and she's a shy person.' But she's not necessarily quiet, and she's not shy," Gammon says. "She's a sensitive person. She's not a loud person."   Laura Bush's values, image and opinions are not just fodder for fashion magazines or Beltway buzz about whether she supports abortion rights or disagrees with her husband's opposition to embryonic stem-cell research. They could become an important part of the campaign as voters compare the wives of the two candidates.   Political spouses don't shift many votes, but their styles and personalities help fill out voters' perceptions of the candidates. Teresa Heinz Kerry, 65, is wealthy, blunt, exotic and a very visible part of her husband's campaign. Laura Bush, 57, is all Texan. She was born in Midland, the only child of a family of modest means. She's more ordinary than exotic, but she's becoming more direct and visible.   In 2000, she made only a few solo appearances, sticking for the most part by her husband's side. This year, she has raised $5.5 million for her husband's campaign.   She doesn't volunteer any policy differences with her husband but implies that there are some. "I understand why he holds views that he holds, and I know he understands me, and our values are very much the same," she says.   She can deliver a message for the president, as she did earlier this month when Ronald Reagan's death fueled speculation that Bush might soften his policy on embryonic stem-cell research. Even though her father also died of Alzheimer's disease, she went on network and cable TV shows to say that the president's position had not changed.   "The role that (political spouses) play is to help define their husbands," says Brad Coker of the independent Mason-Dixon Poll. "Laura Bush probably appeals to stay-at-home mother types and Heinz Kerry probably appeals to more independent-minded working women."   Polls show that Bush appeals most to women over 50. A USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll taken this month found that 52% of Americans said Bush fits their idea of a first lady; 43% preferred the Hillary Clinton model.   In an interview, Bush hints that she's mindful of the high profile of Heinz Kerry, who was on the cover of the May 3 issue of Newsweek and has been the subject of many, mostly positive, profiles. Bush says she doesn't recall getting quite as much attention four years ago. Asked if she knows Heinz Kerry, her reply is innocuous but has a slight edge: "I never have met her -- that I know of."     Humanizing her husband     There is nothing pretentious about the way Bush travels. She rides in a black Chevy Suburban rather than a limo. Her motorcade is modest: just four vehicles and a police escort that doesn't use lights or sirens. She stops for traffic lights.   At a recent rally in Fort Washington, a Philadelphia suburb, about 1,500 supporters -- more women than men -- waved signs that said "W stands for Women" and greeted her with a roar. Bush came onto the stage wearing a finely tailored sage green pantsuit to long and loud cheers. As she began to speak, one woman shouted out, "We love you!"   Now her job is to humanize her husband, who has trouble attracting female voters. His campaign advisers are so confident she can help in that regard that she has been prominently featured in several campaign TV ads.   "She is one of the best assets the campaign has and is one of the most popular public figures in the country right now among Republicans, independents and many Democrats," says Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for the campaign. But she came in third in the 2003 USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll of most admired women. For the second year in a row, Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York was first. TV talk-show host Oprah Winfrey came in second.   At three recent political stops in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Minnesota, she gave the same stump speech, which she read from a text. "I'm here to talk to you about why it is so important to re-elect George W. Bush," she began.   Her speech has segments on domestic issues, the war on terror and Iraq, and volunteerism. It ends with a plea: "He's worked hard for us. Now it's our turn to work hard for him," she said.   In each speech, she told the same joke about riding around the Texas Panhandle with her husband during his unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1978. You get to know a lot about a man traveling in a car with him for a month, she said. At each stop, the joke got good laughs.   She used the joke to segue into a key element of her message: that she knows the president better than anyone and can attest that "he is the strong, steady leader we need for these historic times." The line got strong applause, as did this one: "I've known him for 30 years, and he has the character and the courage to meet the demands of our time."   Her message on Iraq was upbeat. Things are improving, she said, and the "picture we're getting on TV is not quite right." She mentioned that in Iraq and Afghanistan, millions of girls are going to school for the first time.   She talked about the effectiveness of her husband's tax cuts, improvements in the economy, education reforms and the Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors. She spoke in calm tones that seemed meant to reassure.   "She's a good mother, a good wife, a good American citizen and a lovely, lovely lady," said Pat Brown, 63, a county elections worker from Chesterland, Ohio. "She's a big, big help to her husband."   Lindsay Stull, 27, a fifth-grade teacher from Cleveland, came to hear Bush talk about education, but remained undecided. ''I appreciate what she said on education, but I still have to see if the vision comes through to reality," she said.     Shunning the 'traditional' label     Some critics see a bit of Nancy Reagan in the loving gazes Laura Bush casts at her husband when she shares a stage with him. And in a biography, The Perfect Wife, that was published this year, Washington Post reporter Ann Gerhart concluded that the first lady has been too indulgent a parent, permitting 22-year-old twins Jenna and Barbara to get away with bad behavior. The twins, recent college graduates, both got into trouble for underage drinking after their father became president. They will work on his campaign this year -- their first venture into politics.   Laura Bush's priorities as first lady have been mostly traditional, a deliberate shift from the activist political agenda of Hillary Clinton. Early childhood education, literacy, library funding, women's health issues and freedom for women in the Middle East have occupied much of her time.   But she always carved out time for herself. She left Washington for several days, even weeks at a time, to vacation with her Texas girlfriends and visit her mother, Jenna Welch, in Midland. This spring, she spent nearly three weeks helping her mother sort through her possessions before she moved into a retirement home. They discovered the letters Harold Welch, Laura's father, wrote to his wife during World War II. He died in 1995.   "If I had had to do that after she died, it would have been a much different experience, but instead it was fun," she says. "We had a lot of memories and a lot of laughter."  Before the halfway point of her husband's term, there were signs that Laura Bush was tiring of the conventional approach to what Pat Nixon called "the hardest unpaid job in the world." Her aides made sure reporters knew that she disliked being called a "traditional first lady." She often says that she doesn't even want to be called "first lady."  While she has often been guarded in revealing her advice to her husband or unwilling to signal a hint of discord, every once in a while she opens up a bit. After Sept. 11, she didn't seem to mind when word got out that she had advised her husband to knock off macho taunts, such as his pledge that Osama bin Laden would be caught "dead or alive."  During his speech in Charlotte, N.C., in October 2002, the president said she couldn't be there because "she needs to sweep the porch because the president of China is coming." A couple of days later, reporters asked her if she liked the joke. She mouthed "no" and shook her head.   In an interview, Bush says she has thought about the issues she would focus on if her husband wins a second term. She's excited about a program that helps middle- and high-school students who can't read catch up. She wants to continue working to "make sure governments respect women," particularly in the Middle East.   She has "of course" considered the possibility that there might not be a second term, she says: "That just is a fact of life in politics."  And the prospect of moving home to their ranch in Crawford, Texas, whether it happens in January or four years later, doesn't prompt much consternation.   "No matter what happens in the election," she says, "we'll be OK."

       AP   The wife of Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards met Saturday with a group of women to talk about their problems getting health insurance.  Elizabeth Edwards was at St. Francis Hospital, where she had a discussion with five local women who have had problems getting or paying for health insurance.  Edwards said listening to peoples’ concerns is the best way to come up with policies that will help them. She said all Americans are entitled to the same health care coverage.  ‘‘We want to know if the answers we have actually end up helping your particular situations,’’ she told the women.  Christine Neumann-Ortiz, one of the participants, said she felt Edwards really listened to her.  ‘‘She was able to lay out a very comprehensive plan about at least, their proposal,’’ she said.  Phyllis Mills, another participant, said she was surprised at how down-to-earth Edwards seemed.  ‘‘I was really impressed with her because she was very concerned about me,’’ Mills said.  John Edwards also talked about health care in a campaign stop Saturday in Fargo, N.D. He called for changes to prescription drug programs and said he and presidential nominee John Kerry would ‘‘stand up to these drug companies and stand up for the American people.’’  The North Carolina senator said that as president, Kerry would allow lower-cost prescription medications to be reimported from Canada and free the government to negotiate lower drug prices from drug companies.  Elizabeth Edwards planned to attend church in Milwaukee on Sunday, then campaign in Green Bay in the afternoon.

       The Washington Post Michael Kinsley   Maybe I missed it, but it seems as if Laura Bush has not had her Lady Macbeth Moment. This is the period, hallowed by tradition if not actually written into the Constitution, when the media discover that the president's wife is the power behind the throne. She is not the sweet helpmate she appears to be. Underneath, there is steel. In fact, she is a (insert a word -- there are more than one -- beginning with "b"). She is her husband's closest adviser and a fierce protector of his place in history. She curbs his partisan instincts or, alternatively, she keeps him on the ideological course. A well-known male rival for the president's ear has been fired on her instructions.  Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush all had their moments. It was a challenge to fit Hillary Clinton into this template, but with a few little fixes (the demure helpmate stuff had to go), she was squeezed in. But when does Laura Bush get her turn? For almost four years she has loyally played along with the treacly conceit, assigned to her at the beginning of the administration, that her only public policy passion is libraries. As far as anyone knows, she has never questioned or failed to obey the instructions of the president's official advisers and spinmeisters. Of course, neither has her husband.  Then last week she suddenly popped off about stem cells. But this was hardly her breakthrough moment. A lot of Republican politicians and operatives spoke out about stem cells last week, all miraculously making the same argument -- an argument so embarrassingly silly and disingenuous that it could only be an official campaign talking point. Anyone thinking for herself would have a hard time getting it out without giggling.  As Laura Bush put it, George Bush "is the only president to ever authorize federal funding for embryonic stem cell research." She noted that "few people know" this. Few may have known it, but many might have guessed. It is true indeed that Bush's predecessors, from George Washington to Bill Clinton, failed to fund embryonic stem cell research. Even Abraham Lincoln. Not a penny for stem-cell research from any of them. Historians believe this might have been because it didn't exist yet. But that's just a guess.  George Bush gave this nascent research a tiny sliver of money and piled on a smothering load of restrictions. As Laura Bush did not note, that makes Bush the only president ever to authorize federal rules against stem cell research.  It is characteristic of George W. Bush that he would not see, or have no patience for, the irony of justifying a policy on moral grounds and then, when it comes under attack, claiming that the policy is not having the very effect he is supposed to want. Meanwhile, it is characteristic of the Bush political machine to be utterly fearless about insisting that things are the way it would be convenient for them to be, despite all evidence that things are the way they really are.  The purpose of Bush's stem cell policy is to discourage medical research using embryos. Bush is supposed to think that these clumps of a few dozen cells are every bit as human as the people who will suffer or die from diseases that stem cells could cure. He had better believe that, because stem-cell research uses embryos being discarded by fertility clinics and doesn't actually add to the embryonic death toll at all. Only a deep conviction about the humanity of these microscopic dots -- which have fewer human characteristics than a potato -- could justify sacrificing real human lives to make the purely symbolic point that these dots are human too.  Scientists are in agreement that Bush's policy is succeeding. Stem cell research has been drastically slowed. Yet Bush surrogates now pretend that the policy's real success is its failure to stop this research completely. Hey! You're supposed to think all those embryos being used in privately funded research are human victims, remember? It's a huge tragedy, remember? Stop bragging about it.  In a display of her husband's famous compassionate conservatism, Laura Bush scolded that "it really isn't fair to people who are watching a loved one suffer" to overplay the promise of stem cells. She said, helpfully, "We don't know that stem cell research will provide cures for anything."  As someone with a loved one (myself, as it happens) who has the disease (Parkinson's) for which stem cells hold the most promise, please allow me to say: Thank you so much, Mrs. Bush, for trying to make sure that I don't get too hopeful. While your husband and Sen. John Kerry make a major issue out of who is more optimistic, it is inspiring to have a first lady with the courage to say: Let's be pessimistic! Optimism is unfair!  But talk is cheap. While Laura Bush is destroying hope by the traditional method of spreading gloom and pessimism, her husband is bringing the pessimist's art into the 21st century by actually destroying the objective basis for hope. While she battles rhetorically against false hopes, he works to ensure that there is no hope at all.  On balance, I think I prefer her approach.

       Ohio News Now   The wife of Democratic vice presidential candidate John Edwards visited Ohio Saturday and spoke with members of military families.   Elizabeth Edwards was in Vandalia, north of Dayton, where she had a question-and-answer session with 25 people. Edwards said she feels that she has a special relationship with military families because she grew up on military bases around the world. Edwards' father was a Navy pilot.   Edwards said military families tend to be more respectful of the president's office, regardless of their position on the war in Iraq. But she said that doesn't mean those families don't have opinions, and don't vote on those opinions.

       Sunday Herald Ros Davidson    One is mouthy and colourful, a multilingual Mozambique-born ketchup billionaire. The other is serene, openly adoring of her husband – and, it has to be said, something of a nonentity.  The 2004 presidential race is also a battle of two spouses : Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of the Democratic contender, and Laura Bush, the First Lady. Although the conventional wisdom is that Americans do not vote on the basis of a candidate’s spouse, this year could be different.  Between 55% and 65% of undecided voters are female – and Heinz Kerry could be just the woman to energise them, according to Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior political scholar at the University of Southern California and a contributing editor of the Los Angeles Times. “The whole campaign is about undecided voters in the battleground states,” she says. The race is so tight that each campaign team is looking for anything that gives their candidate an edge – and the wives could yet be the key.   To supporters of George W Bush, Heinz Kerry is another Hillary Clinton, polarising and distracting. For those backing John Kerry, she has everything Laura Bush does not: opinions, soul and independence.   The opening line from her much-anticipated speech to the Democratic Convention in Boston last month has already become famous. “My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry. And by now I hope it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have something to say,” she announced as the delegates roared. Indeed, the 65-year-old is famous for saying what she thinks, when she thinks it – such as telling a journalist from a right-wing newspaper to “shove it!” on the eve of the Democratic Convention, or claiming that re-electing George Bush will mean “four more years of hell”.   She has also fielded questions on foreign policy on CNN’s Larry King Live, and talked about how she marched against apartheid while she was a student in Johannesburg.      Often she is the first to walk to the back of the Kerry-Edwards campaign plane to jaw with the press: in typical Teresa style, she may be wearing shades and carrying a glass of wine. And once she told a TV interviewer, with a mischievous smile, that she’s sexy, that she uses Botox and that she made her husband sign a prenuptial agreement. (She inherited her fortune from her first husband, the Republican senator John Heinz, who was killed in a plane crash in 1991.)   But she can also be insensitive. “You can talk to the simplest people about any issue,” she once told a crowd in Boston. On another occasion she told 3200 Democratic women: “Women for Kerry need birth control, you’ve gotten so huge!”   At a recent campaign stop in Wisconsin, she even seemed to overshadow her husband. At a brewery, John Kerry walked up to a female employee for a handshake. But she looked right past him and asked: “Where’s Teresa?”   According to one insider, the Kerry campaign team made a decision early on to “let Teresa be Teresa”. In the last few days, however, she has slipped slightly from view, amid rumours that she and her husband have been arguing so much they have slept in different hotel rooms.  Despite this, Celinda Lake, one of the Democrats’ senior political strategists, is confident that Heinz Kerry will increase the turnout of single women, which should give her husband a major boost. More women vote Democrat than do men, and polls have suggested that single females respond favourably to outspoken women such as Heinz Kerry. In the last presidential election, more than 21 million single women – nearly 50% of those eligible – did not bother to vote.   Laura Bush, on the other hand, couldn’t be much more different. Her recent campaign work in key battleground states was dubbed the “I’m not Teresa” tour by the press: several days of scripted sweetness and devotion. The closest she has come to controversy is talking about stem-cell research, but even then she merely hinted that there were two sides to the issue, staying above the political fray.  She has also been careful to visit female-owned businesses and remind potential supporters that her husband has two senior female advisers, Condoleezza Rice and Margaret Spellings, who deal with national security and domestic policy respectively. “ That means that in the White House women are in charge of everything abroad and everything at home, which sounds about right to me,” she has said .   Yet Bush’s focus has almost always been on her husband, in stark contrast to Heinz Kerry, who prefers talking about ideas. Bush has started almost every recent speech with a version of “I’m here to talk about George Bush” or “I’m proud of my husband”. A new television advert for the Republicans sums up her role: she listens as her husband talks emotionally about the September 11 victims. She exudes love for George, but is grave, wholesome and silent.      Perhaps because of this, she has become one of the Bush campaign’s strongest assets. Yet she has also started to show a more light-hearted side, joking with chat-show host Jay Leno about gambling and her formidable mother-in-law Barbara. And she has become a key fundraiser: her take this year is $10 million.  Her low-key approach also means she gives her critics little ammunition. In one recent poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Bush had an “unfavourable rating” of 12% – less than half Heinz Kerry’s 26%. The best most of her detractors can do is point out that, as a former librarian and school teacher, she shelves her books at home by the Dewey decimal system. However, a new anti-Bush play by the celebrated writer Tony Kushner does depict her reading to dead Iraqi children.   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, downplays the importance of the two women . “Each campaign is trying to spin this First Lady thing to their advantage,” he says dismissively. But that, of course, is the point: when an election promises to be this close, you need every advantage you can get.

       The New York Times  Randy Kennedy   In some ways, Laura Bush is the White House's stealth campaigner.  When her motorcade winds through the streets of Washington to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, it includes no limousine and sometimes it even stops at red lights. In fact, perhaps the only clue a passing driver may have that the first lady is inside one of the black sport utility vehicles is the team of Secret Service agents facing backward in an SUV near hers, staring vigilantly out an open back window.  On the road, meanwhile, her campaigning has generated far fewer headlines than that of her husband's other main surrogate, Vice President Dick Cheney.  But as she begins several weeks of solo barnstorming in states crucial for her husband's re-election, Laura Bush is becoming an increasingly visible and effective part of White House strategy, largely because she is seen as someone above the rough-and-tumble of the political fray.  In the last four months, she has been steadily raising her profile, projecting an image much more assertive and assured than she did during the 2000 campaign. She has joked with Jay Leno, made the morning news-show circuit and appeared in Internet campaign commercials. She has also proved to be a formidable fund-raiser, generating $10 million for the campaign this year while speaking at more than a dozen events from Maine to Missouri.  And less than three weeks from now, in what will undoubtedly be her most important public moment of the 2004 campaign, she will give one of the prime-time speeches at the Republican National Convention in New York. (Her every handshake, smile and speech on the campaign trail are being recorded for a videotape that will be shown as she is introduced at Madison Square Garden.)  Bush, 57, makes little secret that while she has no problem with public speaking, political campaigning is not one of her favorite pursuits. But ever since giving her first stump speech of the year, in Las Vegas in May, she has skillfully turned her lack of political polish to her advantage.  She reads from prepared remarks in the careful manner of the schoolteacher she used to be, rarely varying her tone or volume, even when the speech seems to call for doing so and her words are eliciting cheers.  But she often makes prolonged eye contact with individuals in the audience, and when she loses her place in the speech, which does not happen often, she smiles and forges ahead, sending a kind of tacit "Y'all understand I'm not a politician" message to her listeners. Then she often spends more time than her handlers would like shaking hands, posing for pictures and talking to supporters.  "What she does up there is exude the love she has for her husband and the respect she has for him," said Bette Duncan, a co-owner of an electronics manufacturing company, who went to hear the first lady speak in Grafton, Wisconsin. "And that's refreshing in politics. It's not all 'me, me, me.' Laura is just a great woman."  In her busiest campaign swing so far - six states Monday and Tuesday - Bush's main target was women, who polls show do not support her husband in the same numbers as men.  She is clearly aware of her image as a first lady who has not been involved in policy making or political infighting, and - except for comments on Monday in support of the president's policy on stem cell research - she assiduously avoids contentious issues, never referring to her husband's opponent.  Instead, she delivered reliable applause lines this week to groups of women who own small businesses in Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota, reminding them that a woman, Condoleezza Rice, advised her husband on foreign policy and another, Margaret Spellings, advised him on domestic policy.  "This means that in the White House, women are in charge of everything abroad and everything at home," she said, breaking into a smile, "which sounds just about right to me."  She also assures women that her husband, George W. Bush, feels strongly about equal opportunity.  "And he has three strong women at home who won't let him forget it," she said of herself and their twin daughters.  Laura Bush's team carefully picks campaign stops that will bolster her wholesome, nonpolitician image, like a quilting shop in Minnesota. On Monday she made an unannounced stop at a flag store in North Toledo, hugging the owner, Howard Pinkley, and buying a $5.95 copy of a flag etiquette book called "Honor Our Flag."  She said that despite the spoken prenuptial agreement, often retold, in which her husband promised he would never force her to give a campaign speech, she had helped him campaign almost since the beginning.

       BET.com   The GOP is beginning to play the race card.  In a bold move to attract African American voters in key battleground states, a group of Republicans calling itself People of Color United, has begun running radio ads on Black stations in Cleveland, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Mo., and other urban areas with large minority populations.:: AD ::  The focus of some of these ads: Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry. In one ad, the announcer says “his wife says she’s an African American. While technically true, I don’t believe a White woman, raised in Africa surrounded by servants, qualifies.”  According to news reports, in the 1990s, Heinz Kerry described herself as an African American. But William Marshall, Jr., director of African American media affairs at the Democratic National Committee, says that Heinz Kerry has not described herself as an African American in recent times.  But the issue does come up on the campaign trail.  He said that at the recent Democratic Party convention, “a number of female delegates began shouting ‘an African American woman in the White House, an African American woman in the White House.’ That happens a lot whenever she encounters large groups of African American women. Out of love and respect for her, they address her that way.”  Heinz Kerry was born in Mozambique, in south-eastern Africa, to Portuguese parents, and at the convention she affirmed her African roots.  People United, based in Washington, D.C., is the latest in a number of nonprofit groups that is taking out ads to influence the outcome of the upcoming Nov. 2 elections. The group shelled out $70,000 for the air time on the Black stations, and one of its backers, J. Patrick Rooney is the former chairman of Golden Rule Insurance, Co.   Rooney, who is white, told The Washington Post in an e-mail, “I support [the] group because the genuine word for the Black community should be heard, not white folks saying for them.”  In her adult life, Heinz Kerry has become a powerful woman, who like many African American women, is known to speak her mind. She is the head of the $1.2 billion Heinz Foundation., which funds programs in the environment, urban revitalization, the arts and education. Her personal fortune is estimated to exceed $1 billion.

       Omaha World-Herald    The first lady has shown that politics needn't permeate intellectual life.  Campaign season tends to bring out an extra dose of snideness in political comments. In that light, it shouldn't be surprising that some Democratic partisans have sought to build up Teresa Heinz Kerry by making snippy remarks about Laura Bush.   The current first lady, it's whispered, is a tiresome "Stepford Wife" throwback - way too prim and proper for today's enlightened era.   It's a silly claim. A first lady need not follow any particular personality type, whether traditional or untraditional, as long as she displays a basic maturity of temperament.   That is a quality Mrs. Bush abundantly demonstrates. She deserves credit for approaching the role of first lady on her own terms, with an impressive self-awareness and composure.   Her character was put in high relief by a recent hostile biography titled "The Perfect Wife" that was an unintentional self-parody of liberal condescension. The text was saturated with exasperation that a woman of Mrs. Bush's intelligence inexplicably refuses to adopt a left- wing agenda.   One of Mrs. Bush's most commendable acts has been to demonstrate that the serious discussion of American literature need not be hijacked by ideological zealotry.   White House conferences she hosted on female writers of the American West (including Nebraska's own Willa Cather), Mark Twain and the writers of the Harlem Renaissance brought together academicians from across a broad political spectrum. A constructive tone marked the discussions.   Even left-leaning scholars critical of her husband's policies acknowledged the seriousness and depth of knowledge the first lady brought to the gatherings. In short, she demonstrated that politics need not invade every corner of intellectual life.   That is a refreshing lesson, the product of a serious and thoughtful intellect.

       US Newswire   Elizabeth Edwards, wife of Democratic candidate for vice president John Edwards (news - web sites), will hit the campaign trail on her first solo trip this Friday, August 13th. She will travel to Ohio to discuss key issues in the presidential campaign, particularly how to make America's economy work for the middle class and the importance of affordable, quality and reliable health care for all Americans.    Senator and Mrs. Edwards believe that with a Kerry-Edwards Administration, the American economy can truly turn a corner with their plan to lift up middle class families by creating decent jobs, enacting tax cuts that help middle class families pay for child care and college for their children, and ensuring affordable health care.   Elizabeth Edwards will highlight these important issues as she takes a tour of women-owned businesses in Columbus and meets with African American leaders in Cincinnati.    Elizabeth Edwards has been active on the campaign trail over the past few weeks, connecting with voters on issues ranging from women's initiatives to health care. Mrs. Edwards is an attorney who has been married to John Edwards since 1977. They are the proud parents of four children: Cate, a recent graduate of Princeton University, a 6-year-old daughter, Emma Claire, and a 4- year-old son, Jack. Their first child, Wade, died in 1996.   Details of Mrs. Edwards's trip are below:  WHEN: Friday, Aug. 13 -- 2:15 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Tour & Discussion With Working Women Stop 1: Location: Moda Verite  2:15 p.m. to 2:25 p.m. -- 641 N.

       Washington Post  Ann Gerhart   The plane crashed.   There were no survivors.   The freak midair collision between a small plane and a helicopter killed the senator from Pennsylvania, the pilots, and two little girls who had been skipping in the schoolyard at recess when the flaming metal fell from the sky.   One moment, Teresa Heinz was puttering around her Georgetown home, waiting for her husband to call so that their youngest son could share the great news from the day's mail. He had been accepted to Yale, his father's alma mater. The next moment, that life was gone. At 51, she was a widow with three boys, the heiress to a $500 million fortune grown from pickles and ketchup, new leader of a philanthropic family and chief caretaker of its legacy.   Within days of the April 4, 1991, tragedy, she rejected calls for her to assume John Heinz's Senate seat. Instead, she was determined to take over the Heinz endowments, with combined assets of more than a billion dollars. They were headquartered in Pittsburgh, a once wealthy, enlightened city guided by the industrialist paternalism of the Carnegies and the Mellons and the Heinzes. By the mid-'80s, the region's big steel was dead, many of its workers unemployed and hurting, its slag heaps and brownfields scarring the original beauty of the hilly topography, its three rivers polluted.   She was decimated, personally, and "that place" -- her city -- "was decimated psychologically and economically. My job was to go home. That was my instinct," Heinz Kerry recalled in an interview aboard the campaign plane on Friday. She told herself, "I have to mother my kids, and I have to mother Pittsburgh."  Trained as an interpreter, fluent in five languages, a native of Mozambique who didn't become a doctor because she thought it would interfere with being a wife and mother, Heinz Kerry knew nothing of fiduciary responsibility or the machinations of charitable works. She had heart. She had intuition and intellect.  And she had a whisper of advice from her late husband: After his death, someone handed her a sheaf of singed and soggy notes in his handwriting. They had fluttered to earth from the wreckage.  The senator had been working on his plan for the Heinz foundations on the flight. His widow studied the notes, reflected on conversations they had during their 25-year marriage, drew on her own experience in founding a preschool and aiding Soviet Jews. Then, through the canyon of her grief, she began to reorganize the foundations according to his wishes.   Over the past 13 years, as the firm guiding force of the family philanthropy, Teresa Heinz Kerry has helped choose who gets the $50 million to $70 million the charities pass out each year to educational, environmental and cultural programs. She hands out the annual Heinz Awards, which bestow $250,000 on leaders and thinkers in those areas most important to John Heinz. She has a think tank in Washington. And, through her own personal philanthropies, she helped develop a prescription drug plan for senior citizens adopted by the commonwealth of Massachusetts.   Even now, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, as she jets to campaign rallies and works on her Tuesday night speech, Heinz Kerry is huddling with her chief of staff, Jeffrey Lewis, going over analyses of similar drug blueprints for Rhode Island, Virginia and Idaho.   The very breadth of her work, and her very deep pockets, have caused some conservatives to question her influence and its potential for conflicts of interest should her husband of nine years, Sen. John Kerry, become president. Foundation officials and Heinz Kerry dismiss such concerns. She has said repeatedly that while she and Kerry talk about issues, she has never offered him advice about policy. And he has never set foot in the endowments' offices in Pittsburgh.  As she has molded the charities, so has the work molded her. She is a visionary, say those who have worked with her closely, but a highly pragmatic one. "I have grown confident," said Heinz Kerry, in her thinking and agenda. "I am not afraid of making mistakes. You can tinker," in life and in philanthropy, she suggested, and you can fail. "The value is to figure out why things do or do not work."  Once so grimy and gray, Pittsburgh now glistens by day and glitters by night, its spectacular skyline reflected in the water.   It has a vibrant arts and cultural district right downtown where the red-light district used to be, anchored by the historic Heinz Hall built by her late father-in-law for the Pittsburgh Symphony. There are two venues, the Byham and the Benedum, which rival Europe's finest opera halls for opulence. A new modern stage was designed by Michael Graves. The performance spaces and galleries have brought eclectic restaurants and a fledgling movement to convert some gorgeous old buildings into jazzy new condominiums.   Pushed by Heinz Kerry, Pittsburgh has become the most environmentally progressive city in the nation, proclaims its mayor, Tom Murphy, who has taken to calling her "St. Teresa."   Programs are underway to build residential housing on top of slag heaps and an island where a rendering plant once stood. A wide swath of open space will be landscaped with hiking trails and bicycle paths and perhaps a light rail line to link neighborhoods.   A new, 1.5 million-square-foot convention center swoops up over the Allegheny river. Unlike the dark box it replaced, the new center, clad mostly in white aluminum with a stainless steel roof, appears as if it might sail off upriver. Its halls are flooded with daylight; its thick cable supports are exposed throughout the halls, soaring toward the ceiling. With its water recycling systems and its energy-conserving skylights, it is the largest certified "green" building in the country.   The banks of the rivers have been purchased for incorporation into a city park that, including the water itself, will be the size of Central Park in New York. Native grasses have been planted along miles of former parking spaces, where people now stroll, bike and rollerblade. The city's two new stadiums sit behind the riverbanks, and open space is under development between them.   Heinz Kerry's thinking threads through all of the revitalization in this city of 338,000. She has remained true to the ideals of her late husband, an only child who headed the endowments for only four years, after the death of his father.   It was her idea to hold a design competition for the new convention center. She funded it, "and then she was out of it. She doesn't exercise her own eye," said Janet Sarbaugh, who heads the cultural programs of the endowments. The jury chose Rafael Viñoly, the architect for the Kennedy Center expansion. It was Heinz Kerry's idea to form a river life task force of public officials and private foundations and other civic leaders.   At a joint board meeting in 1999 of the two family endowments, during a discussion of urban design, Heinz Kerry jumped from her seat and went to the large windows of the offices, high above the Allegheny river. She was dismayed, gazing at a housing development across the river. It had all the visual appeal of a standard-issue La Quinta Inn.   "We have got to make sure that what happens on the riverfront isn't schlock," she said, recalls Maxwell King, the endowments' president, "so that it doesn't fill in in a haphazard, episodic and dysfunctional way. Because once it's filled in, there is no way we can come back and change it." Such was her passion and conviction, he said, "it was the only time the board spontaneously appropriated a million dollars," thereby launching a comprehensive waterfront plan.   Heinz Kerry held meetings and hosted a dinner at her family farm outside Pittsburgh, and through those many discussions a plan took shape.   "Teresa didn't invent the rivers, and she wasn't the first person to think about doing something on the rivers, but she applied that very creative and intense and elliptical thinking, always returning to the topic," said King, former editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer. "So that what finally resulted is a stark six or eight levels of quality higher than it would have been without her. And it ain't just the money; it's her mind."  Certainly, financially strapped city officials, arts and cultural leaders and endowment staffers would be loath to criticize a benefactress backed by billions. Those who work for and with her say Heinz Kerry is demanding and questioning, and they swear they love her for it. Presented with a proposal, Heinz Kerry will fire back a series of questions, "and that could be five to 50, and it may start on a Monday and finish on a Friday, and you may be writing and ginning up memo after memo, and we will be going back and forth," said Lewis, her chief of staff. "And it's interesting intellectually. This way, there is someone else challenging your thinking, which is the fun part, once you've done all your analysis." She will get out her calculator and start adding up numbers.   Heinz Kerry is, said William McDonough, an architect hired to collaborate on several foundation projects, "a humanist who can do math." She wanted him to use narra, a "non-extinct" rosewood, in his redesign of the foundation offices, but only if the price was competitive. The order, for $75,000 of the wood, jump-started the formation of a small company in San Francisco to find the material and deliver it. Then local cabinetmakers crafted with the narra, and their familiarity with it led in turn to other designers placing other orders.   "Teresa has this capacity to help people find their own strengths," said Grant Oliphant, who was press secretary to John Heinz and now is associate director at the foundations. "That's why she is so effective as a leader. I think it's why her friends call her 'Mama T.' She really pays attention to what people have to offer and tries to draw that out of them."  "She can be very strident about it, but she wants to nurture," said Doug Root, the endowments' communications officer.  When consensus has been reached, she gets out of the way.   "I don't mess with people," Heinz Kerry said. "I just want them to be accountable." She believes in newer "venture philanthropy," using the monies like venture capital, to incubate ideas. She does not believe in endlessly bailing out struggling institutions, which may have become dependent on the largesse of their wealthy supporters. "That annual giving has to stop," she insisted. The foundations have imposed outside experts on foundering groups as a condition of the grants.   The symphony learned the hard way whom it was dealing with when she bluntly refused the board's first request for $30 million for its new capital drive. The symphony had to cut costs, fix its long labor problems and increase its subscriptions. Then it got $20 million. Similarly, Heinz Kerry said, when the opera company was projecting costs over its agreed budget, its board cut one of its offerings that season to save the money, and, Heinz Kerry said, "we gave them a $150,000 prize check, as a reward for making the tough decision. We don't live in the era of the old habits." In 2002, the endowments were greeted with howls of protest when, along with two other groups, they withdrew $3 million in literacy funds they had put into the public schools.  There have been failures.   Impassioned about early-childhood development, Heinz Kerry spurred the foundations to provide educational programs for low-income preschoolers and raised money from other sources. But, after three years, the endowments pulled the plug. They had spent more than $30 million and served fewer than 700 students.   In keeping with Heinz Kerry's insistence on learning from mistakes, the endowments then commissioned two studies to determine what went wrong.  She is not the sort of rich woman who can move through Pittsburgh's cultural district, admiring the meticulously restored gilt on the historic theaters' proscenium arches, and not see the many homeless people panhandling on the sidewalks outside.   "One of my dreams is to bring real life back to downtown," she begins, and launches in a ruminative, discursive discussion of how to solidify the economic health of Pittsburgh's downtown by linking its residents more easily by water taxis. To listen to her idea in its entirety makes clear the thoroughness of her thought -- it has to do with supporting an emerging young middle class and growing a tax base. It also reveals how her mode of expression is hardly an easy fit for the highly scripted, strictly disciplined message delivery necessary in a presidential campaign. (Even her name is conflicted. In the campaign, she is known as Heinz Kerry; at the endowments, she is Mrs. Heinz.)   Her visions are at once lofty and practical; she is animated when she talks about them. Her eyes flash; her hands swirl through the air. Leaning forward in her airplane seat Friday, her face lit up as she remembered seeing two egrets along the river, and the discovery of a clam "this big!" -- she spread her fingers wide -- where the Allegheny and Ohio join, sure signs of returning water quality.  And, "It is wonderful to see kids make friends with the water," she said, in a city where parents always warned their children, "Don't go down to the river." She wants to expand rowing programs to reach disadvantaged children. "It's such a demanding sport, and can you imagine someday a U.S. boat [competing] with African Americans and Indian and every other ethnic group? Wouldn't that be wonderful? It would look like America! Rather than just these skinny white kids?"  Asked what made her proudest about her work, she said, "Mostly, I feel proudest of the commitment of people to believe."   "In the early years," she said, "I would go once a week and meet with every chief [grantmaking officer], and I would ask them: 'What are your dreams? What stands in the way? Dream!' "  A conservative think tank, the Capital Research Center, has published research that charges the Heinz endowments with funding environmental organizations that "pay for groups sponsoring thinly disguised anti-business drives and partisan political campaigns."   Oliphant calls the allegations "ridiculous" and unfounded, noting the centrist nature of the Heinz family's values -- John Heinz was a Republican. King points out that all philanthropic groups are forbidden from funding political advocacy, and that any grant monies disbursed can flow only into the specific project funded, not an organization's general budget.   "People are usually talking about conflict of interest, and where that usually gets murky and dark and worrisome is in areas where people might personally profit from their official roles," said Oliphant. "We're talking about giving away money here. We're talking about charity! We are buttoned up to a T on every one of our practices, and Teresa subscribes to that as much as any of us; she's been the author of much of it."  What is clear is that there is no precedent for such a powerful woman to rise to the position of first lady. Eleanor Roosevelt created an independent portfolio once she was in the White House, mused King, but "Teresa would bring it in with her."   Having fought to make the transition from being a fairly traditional and shy woman to being secure in her own influence and opinions, Heinz Kerry is disinclined to give up her job. The lawyers have scrutinized her relationships to the endowments -- she chairs one, serves on the board of another, and heads the family philanthropies based in Washington -- and declared there is no conflict.  But demands on her time and the tortured expectations for the proper deportment of a first lady might conspire against her. In her work, her counsel and creativity are prized. In the campaign, they can be a liability.   Asked how she would manage in both roles, she said, "I don't know how I would do it because I have never been here before.  "Normally, it is: 'What's going to be your cause?' I don't have a cause. My cause is a better quality of life -- stronger, healthier, more self-sufficient -- more able to be whole." Throughout the nearly unimaginable drama of her 65 years, she seems to have accomplished this wholeness for herself. And now she is dreaming she might extend it to everybody else.

       WorldNetDaily.com    Some of those who attended Teresa Heinz Kerry's address to the Democratic National Convention's "gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender caucus" – an event uncovered by the "straight" media – believe the would-be first lady broadly hinted at her covert support for same-sex marriage.   Greeted with thunderous applause – and chants of "Teresa, Teresa, Teresa – from the crowd of 200 last week, Mrs. Kerry told the group: "I know that I am welcomed and I am grateful to be welcomed. I'm grateful to you because you symbolize family. You symbolize strength and hope. You symbolize resistance. And you symbolize tolerance. For that we are all thankful to you."    According to a report in the Washington Blade, Mrs. Kerry outshined other speakers who included Rob Reiner, Ben Affleck and "Sopranos" television star Steve Buscemi.   "You are in a sense pushing the envelope," she said. "We have to respond with policies that reflect the capacity and the tolerance of all Americans."   The Blade reporter suggested Mrs. Kerry was possibly referring to her husband's position of support for civil unions rather than gay marriage.   "But," she continued, "because things are difficult doesn't mean they won't happen."   She told of how she was moved at a campaign appearance a few months ago in Washington state, when a man told her in a question and answer session that his relationship with his mother was strained and told her, "I want you to be my mother."   "It was clear that he had not made that peace with his mother and he wanted someone who loved him," Heinz Kerry said. "And so, at least, if nothing else, you'll have a mom in the White House," she told the crowd.   Added Heinz Kerry: "You can call me Mama T."   That remark prompted the homosexual delegates to jump to their feet chanting "Mama T!"   "If my child ever came to me and said, Mom, or if my husband's daughters told me, 'This is who we are and this is what I plan to do,' then I would feel as a mother free to share my joy, my pride with all my friends, no matter what circumstances ... or understanding of the culture, in the same way that if my son would say, 'I want to marry this wonderful girl.'

      Post-Dispatch  Cynthia Billhartz   Don Massey, 40, of St. Louis is waiting to enter the rally for Democrats John  Kerry and John Edwards at Union Station last Thursday, when he hopes out loud  for a glimpse of Teresa Heinz Kerry.   When asked why, Massey expresses an admiration for her brains and feistiness -  only he uses a saltier term for the latter attribute.   "Women don't have to sit back as the first lady and keep quiet," he says. "I  think we can handle them in a dual role."   Patricia Patterson, 61, of Oakville, agrees, citing, first, that Heinz Kerry  doesn't just talk about issues such as protecting the environment, she sticks  her money where her mouth is through her endowment. And second, Patterson  admires the quirky billionaire's unpredictability and off-the-cuff utterings.   "I love it!" Patterson says. "Americans can handle the truth. And aren't we  sick of people who are so handled and so packaged?"   Later in the day, Heinz Kerry is seated at a table in a sunny, glass-roofed  rail car that's rattling from St. Louis to Jefferson City, when I mention  Massey and Patterson's comments and remark that Heinz Kerry seems to have fans  of her own.   But the same traits that endear her and Elizabeth Edwards to some voters -  their bluntness, intellect and strong opinions - might be a turnoff to other  voters, some of whom are still undecided. I ask whether either woman ever  thinks about putting her guard up and retreating.   "Never," says an adamant Heinz Kerry.   Edwards, who is sitting across the table, shakes her head and says: "I think  it's really important for all of us to be exactly who we are at all times.  Americans are very good at being able to see pretense. Whether or not they  prefer somebody strong or somebody meek, I think people respond positively to  the fact that you are who you are and that you don't pretend to be anybody  else."   Besides, adds Heinz Kerry, America is not a country of weak women.   "Any woman who deals with the earth, any woman who raises kids, any woman who  doesn't wear white gloves all day - that's a strong woman," she says. "And what  is most interesting is that the older women I bump into - the really older  women, the 80-year-old women, the 100-year-old women - they're the ones who  love what we're doing the most."   And it's not just women, she adds. She sees the faces of men who are also  excited.   "I look at them and I think, these are people who have felt - for one reason or  another - diminished or frustrated or unjustly treated; and they see someone  being frank and open to them and they like it," she says.   On the train   Teresa Heinz Kerry, 65, and Elizabeth Edwards, 55, are campaigning with their  candidate husbands on an 1,800-mile whistle stop tour that began in St. Louis.  During the trip, the women will no doubt speak to dozens of journalists along  for the ride. For better or worse, I am among the first to interview the two  women together.   Shortly after the train makes a brief campaign stop in Washington, Mo., I slide  across the table from Heinz Kerry and notice a rectangular diamond the size of  a ballot box on her left ring finger. On her left wrist she wears a $1 yellow  Lance Armstrong bracelet.   John Kerry wears one, too, she says in her lilting Portuguese accent, and  mentions that the cyclist recently called to thank her husband for supporting  his cause.   A smiling and chipper Elizabeth Edwards settles into the seat next to me and  jokingly asks if they should just start talking. Four campaign assistants take  seats nearby.   I begin by asking the women how losing loved ones has changed them and how it  binds them together.   Heinz Kerry's first husband of 25 years, Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., died in a  plane crash in 1991. Five years later, the Edwardses' son Wade died in a car  accident at age 16.   Heinz Kerry points out that everyone experiences great loss. What binds her and  Edwards together is the suddenness of their losses.   "You feel robbed," Heinz Kerry says. "And maybe what you do is you go on with  your life every day, living a little bit for that person."   Sure, she was sad. "But you hug the sadness," she says, crossing her arms. "And  then you celebrate their life, and you go on."   For the past decade, Heinz Kerry has celebrated by heading the billion-dollar  Heinz family endowment her late husband left her and channeling time, money and  energy into issues that were important to him while he was in the Senate.   And at least once, she celebrated his life by cutting loose on a ski slope. She  sliced non-stop from top to bottom with the same style and efficiency that  Heinz always employed rather than cautiously poking along the way she did  before he died. It was almost as though she was moving on his legs, she says.   But it was the death of her 19-year-old younger sister some 40 years ago that  brought about one of the first, and perhaps most pronounced steps in the  refashioning of Heinz Kerry.   Her sister, she says, was irreverent, funny, brilliant and sexy. Heinz Kerry,  on the other hand, went about her business as "a stick" to whom no one paid  attention.   "And when she died," says Heinz Kerry, "I thought, why did somebody like her  die and not some bland person like me?"   Edwards and the assistants grin at the incongruity.   Edwards says Heinz Kerry was probably experiencing survivor's guilt. Edwards  suspects the boy who was in the car with her son Wade, when he died,  experienced it, too.   "You wonder why you were left behind," Edwards says. "You know the way you  described (your sister), Teresa, could also be a description of you. Maybe she  is alive in you. . . . you're funny and brilliant and sexy."   "But not like my sister. Not like my sister," says Heinz Kerry, insisting that  she's still shy and must force herself to be assertive.   The Edwardses responded to Wade's death in 1996, by first taking time off from  their successful law careers and going into seclusion for several months. They,  then, created a foundation in his name that funds after-school programs and  scholarships.   Thanks to fertility treatments that Edwards won't talk about, she gave birth to  two children, Emma Claire, 6, and Jack, 4, while in her late 40s.   "I think (death) strips people back a little bit and then some part of them  emerges. It's a part that was always there but wasn't always at the forefront,"  she says. "I think it's really brought out a very good part in us even though  both of us would trade it in a second for the people we love."   Earth mothers   Edwards seems deferential to Heinz Kerry throughout the interview, allowing her  to answer questions first. Heinz Kerry, in turn, seems affectionate toward  Edwards, whom she has called "earth mother" to the media.   Heinz Kerry means it as the highest compliment, she says, then launches into an  explanation reminiscent of a stump speech.   "I like to think of myself as an earth mother, because I'm rooted . . . I'm  rooted, too," Heinz Kerry says. "That's why I love Iowa, those people are  rooted, too. And I love people in Pennsylvania, because they're rooted -  there's no B.S. I love that."   Being rooted, she stresses, does not mean being rigid.   "Because rigid breaks, rooted moves," she says, swaying gently like a young pin  oak. "You know who you are, which is different from being rigid."   "It's being open to your emotions and being willing to express them. All of  that is part of it," chimes in Edwards.   Edwards once called herself the anti-Barbie. She said it because someone  described her husband as a Ken doll.   "And we all know the Ken doll, you can put your hand on each of the ears, pinch  his head together and there's nothing in there," says Edwards. "He couldn't  possibly be Ken because, in fact, he's intelligent and strong. And my way of  describing that was to say that's not possible - I'm the anti-Barbie."  Heinz Kerry points out that Barbie is not an earth mother, because Barbie is  manicured.   "And as you can see," says Edwards, holding out her unpolished nails and  laughing.   Then the conversation turns to Edwards' anti-Barbie weight - a subject she's  been pretty open about. Before she can respond, Heinz Kerry deflects the  attention.   "I've gained weight," she announces. "Campaigns are naaaasty things!"   Edwards says Heinz Kerry warned her that dieting would be impossible while  campaigning.   "I've put away a lot of clothes that I can't wear right now," says Edwards.  "It's very hard when your life is so unstructured. . . . It's just harder for  me (to diet right now). When my life has some more regularity I expect to go  back to a more regular weight."   She does see her Rubenesque figure as a way of connecting with the large number  of American women who don't fit the pencil thin image often portrayed in the  media. Looking like them, sounding like them, talking about the things they  care about - it all helps, she says.   "You know, I'd like to say that's my reason, but it's not," she says, laughing.   The train is nearing Jefferson City, where the Kerrys and Edwardses must  detrain and campaign, as an assistant twirls her finger at me to wrap things  up.   Whether it's a certitude can be debated, but many people believe you can define  a man by the woman he marries. I ask Heinz Kerry and Edwards what being wed to  them says about their husbands.   Both agree that it means the candidates are secure with themselves.   "They don't mind sharing the podium," Heinz Kerry says, chuckling and then  growing introspective. "They like good conversation, they like to have a pal  who can tell them what's what, and they clearly like affectionate women,  intelligent women, motherly women."   Edwards says she and Heinz Kerry are the type of women who demand honesty and  directness from their husbands; traits that make the men good leaders.   Both women know that they sometimes make mistakes in the things they say and  do. To err is human and they're human, they point out.   And, yes, sometimes their husbands will comment on those goofs and miscues, by  gently inquiring if they're tired.   But, says Heinz Kerry, they'd never ever scold or ask their wives to behave  differently.   John Kerry knows better, she says.

       Washington Post  Mark Leibovich    Laura Bush has heard enough Teresa questions.  "Every interview," the first lady says, shaking her head when asked how often she's being queried on her outspoken counterpart, Teresa Heinz Kerry.   Teresa, Teresa, Teresa.  "It was the last question I got from the St. Paul reporter at the last event," Mrs. Bush says. She got Teresa questions from reporters in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan on Monday, and in Wisconsin and Minnesota Tuesday. And there's still Iowa left to go before Mrs. Bush wraps up her two-day tour of scripted sweetness and devotion to George W. Bush -- in other words, her "I'm Not Teresa Tour."  Mrs. Bush is sitting in the back of a black Suburban en route to the St. Cloud, Minn., airport. She has just finished telling the workers at Gruber's Quilt Shop how great they are at making quilts and how great her husband is at being president.  When asked (and asked again) about Heinz Kerry, it is inevitably in the context of Heinz Kerry's recent hits of unintentional news, such as when she told a reporter to "shove it" or said that hecklers chanting "four more years" wanted "four more years of hell."  Mrs. Bush always offers some gracious variation on how she understands what Heinz Kerry is going through. Public life can get tense at times. "She and I are actually in the same boat," she says. "I'm sure we have empathy for each other."  First ladies seem to be publicly defined in relation to one another. Is a first lady or prospective first lady like Jackie Kennedy or Nancy Reagan? It's like descriptions of hail -- is it the size of a marble or a golf ball? -- as if first ladies exist as some kind of environmental phenomenon that come in a handful of predetermined sizes.   "Back four years ago, I always got the question, 'Are you going to be like Hillary Clinton or Barbara Bush?' " Mrs. Bush says, waving out the window to a group of supporters holding signs that read "W stands for Women." She says she believes that the American public actually has broad and nuanced perceptions of first ladies. But the media are inclined to use a shorthand.   "It's easier to put people in a box, let it be either/or," she says. "The fact is, all of the women who have been married to presidents have been much more complicated or complex than people perceive."  Is Mrs. Bush more complicated and complex than her public image?   "Sure," she says, and leaves it at that.  Either way, Heinz Kerry is much more likely to be called "complex" or "complicated," for better or -- at Laura Bush's campaign events -- for worse.   "I prefer Laura to someone who can say 'shove it' in five different languages," says Patricia Ott, of Southampton, Pa. She is holding a homemade "Laura Is a Lady" sign Monday outside the Sheraton in Langhorne, Pa., where Mrs. Bush just accepted the endorsement of the Pennsylvania Medical Society's political action committee on behalf of her husband.  You can finish a lot of sentences about Laura Bush with the words "on behalf of her husband," just as Mrs. Bush herself will begin a lot of her sentences with "President Bush plans to," "I'm pleased George Bush is committed to" and "I'm proud of my husband because -- "  Mrs. Bush doesn't talk about whether she's had Botox treatments or signed a prenuptial agreement -- both among Heinz Kerry's greatest hits. For that matter, Mrs. Bush will rarely discuss herself at any great length beyond how it relates to her role as the president's soul mate, best friend and chief character witness. "I'm here to talk about George Bush," she says as a mantra, and strenuously avoids mentioning John Kerry by name.   Her adoring audiences rarely mention Kerry, either. They are far more likely to mention his wife, which makes for a slightly weird dynamic.   Unseen but oft-invoked, Heinz Kerry elicits strong and at times nasty reactions. "Telling someone to shove it in public is inappropriate in my view," says Helene Hartman, of Yardley, Pa. She supports Laura Bush because she supports her husband and, more than that, she "brings a level of dignity and composure to the role of first lady."   "I thought Mrs. Kerry talked mainly about herself and not her husband and I didn't like that," says Alison Rasmus of Heinz Kerry's speech at the Democratic convention last month. Rasmus, a Republican, like most of the people who attend Mrs. Bush's carefully screened events, is in a Toledo hotel to give a "warm Lucas County welcome to Mrs. Laura Bush."  To many admirers of Laura Bush, Heinz Kerry is viewed as being outsize to the point of distraction. The Bush-Cheney campaign seems acutely aware of this sentiment. Mrs. Bush visited six midwestern battleground states over a 36-hour period on Monday and Tuesday, speaking in cookie-cutter hotel ballrooms, in cookie-cutter phrases, in cookie-cutter suburbs and exurbs of Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Detroit, among other stops. (Campaign officials say that Mrs. Bush's heavy schedule was set well in advance and had nothing to do with Heinz Kerry's recent headlines.)  In Langhorne, Mrs. Bush comes as close as she ever will to making political waves. On the three-year anniversary of her husband's decision to ban federal funding for research on new lines of stem cells, Mrs. Bush says that opponents of the president's policy are giving "false hope" to people whose loved ones are suffering from diseases that could conceivably be cured with help from studying such cells. She is interrupted several times by applause from the crowd of 300 medical professionals, several of whom wear white lab coats even though they're in a Sheraton function room.  A few hours later, Mrs. Bush is at a Radisson in Toledo, talking to a group of female small-business owners, dozens of whom are grinning behind her on the stage. She talks of President Bush's compassion, how he shares "our values" and how his tax policies have been a particular boon to women entrepreneurs. As she often does, Mrs. Bush notes that a woman -- Condoleezza Rice -- is her husband's chief adviser on national security and that another woman -- Margaret Spellings -- is his chief domestic policy adviser.  "That means that in this White House, women are in charge of just about everything abroad and everything at home," Mrs. Bush says. "And that sounds about right to me." She smiles sweetly, and the crowd laughs and Mrs. Bush moves on to more testimony about President Bush.  On the way to the Toledo airport, Mrs. Bush will make a "spontaneous" stop at a flag store. She will tell 1,200 supporters at a Boys and Girls Club in Royal Oak, Mich., that the president understands their values.   And she will get through an entire 20-minute interview on the way to the St. Cloud airport without being asked once what she thinks of Teresa Heinz Kerry, a woman she has never met.  "Very good," the first lady says, commending the reporter on his restraint. " 'Cause I wouldn't have really told you."

       Pioneer Press Bill Salisbury   Laura Bush would like to chat with Teresa Heinz Kerry.  The first lady thinks she and the wife of Demo-cratic nominee John Kerry have a lot in common.  "I don't know her. I never have met her. But I have a lot of empathy for her," Bush said in an interview Tuesday after she spoke at a campaign rally at Gruber's Quilt Shop in Waite Park.  "In a lot of ways she and I are in the same boat right now. We're the only two women in America who know what it's like for your husband to run for president in 2004.  "I suspect that if we met each other, we'd probably have a lot to talk about," she added with a laugh.  Bush came to Waite Park to make a pitch for her husband to about 250 female small-business owners and political supporters who were handpicked by the Bush-Cheney campaign. She said her husband has "created an economic environment where women entrepreneurs can succeed and small businesses can flourish and grow." And he has a plan to keep the economy growing, she said.  Before she spoke, about a dozen businesswomen who support Kerry held a forum in neighboring St. Cloud to complain that President Bush has not done enough to hold down health-care costs for small businesses or provide an educated work force.  After her 18-minute speech, Laura Bush sat down to talk in her soft Texas drawl about how important Minnesota is in the presidential election, her growing role on the campaign trail and the side of the president the public doesn't see, as well as Heinz Kerry.  This was her second trip to Minnesota in less than two months, and it came on the heels of the president's visit to Mankato last Wednesday and Vice President Dick Cheney's stop in East Grand Forks on Friday.  "Minnesota is really important to us," the first lady explained. "We barely lost last time (in 2000), and we really want to win Minnesota.  "We have a lot of friends here. We're obviously not taking any vote for granted, but we do have … a lot of volunteers who have signed up across the state.  "I think you'll be seeing more of us," she said, adding that twin daughters Barbara and Jenna Bush are likely to make the next campaign swing through the state.  Their frequent visits are a sign that "Minnesota's 10 electoral votes are very, very important to the Bush campaign," said Lilly Goren, chairwoman of the College of St. Catherine political science department.  Laura Bush is a popular figure who can be an effective surrogate with business and professional women, Goren said. A Gallup Poll last year showed she was the third most-admired woman by Americans after Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.  Two-thirds of Americans have a favorable impression of her, while only 12 percent view her unfavorably, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll taken last month.  Such opinions could help the president shrink the gender gap in Minnesota. A Pioneer Press-Minnesota Public Radio poll last month showed that although the race was a statistical dead heat — Kerry led Bush, 45 to 44 percent, among all voters — women preferred the Democratic candidate, 47 to 37 percent, while men favored Bush, 46 to 40 percent.  Her stop here was part of a two-day, six-state campaign trip, and she said she expects to step up her travels as the election nears. She started Tuesday with a morning rally in Grafton, Wis., and ended the day with a speech in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  "I love events like this one today," she said. "It's fun for me to get to see these very outstanding businesswomen across the United States who are making such a huge difference not only for their employees but also for their whole communities."  Her speech was delayed by 30 minutes because she insisted on stopping her caravan so she could shake hands with about 150 people who showed up to greet her arrival at the St. Cloud airport. She also took time to tour the quilt shop with owner Sue Poser, who built the business that employs a staff of 23 in just six years. "It's such a wonderful success story," the first lady said.  Poser, a political independent, said the event almost didn't happen. When a Bush-Cheney scheduler called to ask to hold the rally there, Poser said the woman who answered the phone told him, "I'm sorry but we don't take solicitations," and hung up. Only when he called back and explained he wasn't asking for money did she let him talk to Poser, who said she was honored to host Bush's visit.  Wearing a wide smile through most of her remarks, the first lady appeared to enjoy the event. "I actually really like it (campaigning)," she said later. "If you like to be with people, then it's a lot of fun."  Because her husband "ended up being a war president," she said, most Americans only see him when he's talking about very serious issues. As a result, they "don't get to see the side of him that I see all the time," she said. "So I don't know that they know that he's funny and fun and has a very sweet, soft side."  On Tuesday, the first lady put a friendly face on the Bush-Cheney team that softened its serious image.

       BBC News Online  Clare Murphy    There was a similar dispute over Teresa Heinz Kerry's request that a reporter "shove it" after he questioned her on the use of the word un-American at the Democratic convention.   Democratic aides say her outspokenness is an asset rather than a hindrance. They hope she will appeal to assertive women - much as Hillary Clinton did and still does.   And indeed, while Mrs Kerry may not be conventional, she does not appear to hold any passionate, outlandish beliefs that could embarrass her party.   Although she was formerly a Republican, her detractors have had to go back nearly 30 years to find a book in which she called Democratic politics "putrid".   Laura Bush - who enjoys popularity ratings her husband may well envy - has taken on a more glamorous and outspoken persona for this campaign - her husband's last.   Although she still clearly prefers to talk about education and reading - her personal projects - she has also started providing justifications for the war in Iraq.   Americans have long admired the apparently intimate and loving relationship she has with the president, who, for his part, has been very public about his love for his wife.   But do popular spouses and children translate into votes?   The pervading wisdom is no, but with the few undecided voters so crucial in what is a neck-and-neck race - this year the family could have more than sentimental value.

       La Junta Tribune Democrat   After Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry's rally in La Junta on Saturday, Fowler Tribune Editor Candi Miell had the opportunity to have a one-on-one interview with Teresa Heinz Kerry on the train before they headed out on the rest of their trip.  During the short interview, Miell talked with Teresa Heinz Kerry about the importance of voting.  Q - Why do you encourage people to vote?  THK - The job that we have to do, all politicians have to do, is to link and connect the dots in the absence of one's involvement. It is also important to understand that a democracy isn't a guaranteed thing just because it's in the books. A democracy has to be lived and enjoyed and exercised for it to work and, eventually, to survive. How we bring that notion to American people depends on a lot of things - depends on how much time they have in the evening at the table to talk about life, to talk about issues. It depends, up to a point, on people's cultural experience meaning what their parent's did and what they talk about. It depends also on what they see in the news and what television they watch. So, we have a huge job as a country to make people first aware and then excited about the possibilities of their government. It could be very exciting. I go all over the country and there are different dilemmas that face different populations so there isn't one answer that fits everything, but, generally speaking, I think it starts in the home - discussion of anything starts in the home. Expectations start in the home, standards start in the home, learning starts in the home. And we know full well that doesn't take place everywhere. So then, your question is very good. How do we fill the gap? How do we motivate that? One would hope that in the workplace people would sit at lunchtime and have some interesting discussions. There's so many ways we can do things. It requires leadership and a certain amount of respect for the possibilities. It's a difficult reality and I think it's going to take all of us to work on this Š so our children grown up, or my grandchild grown up, will have a more participatory society. I know it can be done, it just takes exposure, education.  Q - How important are women's voices in politics?  THK - I think extremely important. Women are the mothers of the world. By that I mean they mother their husbands, they mother their sons, they mother their fathers, they mother their children. Women culturally have been that. So, women's voices are extremely important and women have got to know how very valuable a positive role on themselves, individually, is and not just at home. It's vital. And we, those of us who are community leaders Š need to find ways of allowing women to understand that so that they value it. Without values, without feeling a sense of value, they're not going to invest very much because they don't think they'll make a difference.

       Omaha World-Herald  Marianne Means   The competition for the role of first lady is a subtext of the presidential campaign. We don't vote for president's wives, but they do influence how we view their husbands.   This year, the contrast is clear between Laura Bush, 57, and Teresa Heinz Kerry, 66. It's pas- tels vs. fire- engine red, ladyfingers vs. ginger snaps, sugar vs. salsa.   Lady Lau- ra so far has been a relatively unengaged political partner, keeping her comments bland, content to play a traditional role. Defining her job conservatively has made her a popular, inoffensive figure, although her deferential ap- proach is the despair of women's-rights advocates.   By contrast, Heinz Kerry is a sophisticated original. She is actively committed to affecting public policy, and she's not afraid to speak her mind.   Consequently, she is getting the harsh, early-Hillary treatment, drawing conservative scorn for being an uppity female and news-media needling for being unscripted and unpredictable.   She is showing plenty of spunk. This is a political companion who can take care of herself, just as Hillary Clinton has. (With one difference: Tempestuous Teresa has no known ambitions to testify before Congress or to run for public office herself).   President Bush thinks the contrast between his wife and Kerry's helps his own image. He has made a point of saying that the best reason to vote for him was to keep Laura Bush in the White House. Democrats fumed that he was trading on Laura's popularity and picking on Teresa.   As a nation, we still have difficulty adapting to the concept that, intellectually and politically, women can do anything men can do. Verbally and legally, we pay homage to the idea of equality. But, deep inside, we still harbor a double standard by which we judge the genders.   Ever since Jacqueline Kennedy filled the White House with antiques, presidential wives have had special projects. Their tasks have varied widely in importance, depending upon the interests of the women themselves.   But their good works are not supposed to upstage the major public-policy decisions being made by their husbands. Rosalynn Carter, for instance, was viciously criticized for sitting in on Cabinet sessions, a practice suggesting too intrusive a wifely role.   The Constitution says nothing about the responsibilities of a president's wife, but that great document was written before women won first the vote and then full legal rights. Now, many women hold well-paying and visible professional and political jobs; 14 sit in the U.S. Senate, a record high.   Yet Heinz Kerry is usually put down as "opinionated" or a "loose cannon." She is seldom mentioned without a crack noting that she is a billionaire. But she is so much more.   She runs a family foundation with the vast fortune she inherited when her first husband, ketchup heir Sen. John Heinz, died in a plane crash. She is not a mere figurehead; she shapes its every policy move.   She has earned 10 honorary degrees for her charitable work. She won the 2003 Albert Schweitzer Gold Medal for Humanitarianism for her efforts on behalf of the environment, health care, education and the rights of women and children around the world.   She delivered an eloquent, emotional speech at the Democratic convention. But it got far less attention than she did for telling a pest writing for a right-wing Pittsburgh paper to "shove it."   Conservatives demanded she apologize. You'd think she had echoed Dick Cheney's "F" word. He didn't apologize, and she didn't either.   If the Kerrys reach the White House, she intends to remain in charge of the Heinz Foundation, which is virtually a full- time occupation. It would be the first time a first lady held outside professional employment.   In her speech, she appealed for understanding. "My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called opinionated, is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish," she said.   "And my hope is that, one day soon, women - who have all earned their right to their opinions - instead of being called opinionated, will be called smart and well-informed, just like men."   Both Lady Laura and the Tempestuous Teresa are intelligent, articulate women. It would serve the nation well if they could be persuaded to debate on television, as their husbands will.   Such unprecedented drama could excite voters in a way dull, policy-laden speeches cannot. We could see through their eyes what our presidential candidates are like when they are offstage and off message. And it would affirm, once and for all, the importance of a good first lady.

       AP David Espo   The hour was late, the day had been long, but Teresa Heinz Kerry felt like dancing. As a six-piece Mariachi band played at the train station Saturday night and her husband signed autographs a few feet away, she began to sway to the music. A young gentleman in the welcoming party, Javier Martinez of Albuquerque, gallantly offered his hand and soon they were dancing to the lively strains of "El Rey."   Autograph duty complete, Kerry stepped toward the couple, smiling and clapping his hands in appreciation of their style.   Martinez, 22, bowed to invite the Democratic presidential candidate to break in. He demurred. Martinez gestured again. This time, Kerry agreed and took his wife's hands into his own.   The dancing was considerably less lively, and within seconds, Mrs. Kerry lost a sandal.   Kerry bent over without hesitation, picked up the shoe and placed it on his wife's foot. The couple embraced to the strains of Cielito Lindo — "My Pretty Little Sky."

       NEWS.scotsman.com Sahm Vemter   AS A would-be Democratic First Lady, Teresa Heinz Kerry nailed her radical colours to the mast with stories of the struggle against South African apartheid while a student in the country.   But now contemporaries from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg say her participation in an anti-apartheid protest march, which she used to describe her fearlessness, was an isolated event.   John Kerry’s billionaire wife is remembered either as very religious or beautiful, but certainly not as a radical political activist.   In April 1959, students and lecturers donned their academic gowns and marched on the Johannesburg City Hall. Banners announced their opposition to the government’s attempts to ban black students from campus. Teresa Ferreira, as she was then known, was among the 3,000 or so who marched that day, as she reminded US Democratic Party members at their convention in Boston.   She told delegates: "I learned something then, and I believe it still. There is a value in taking a stand, whether or not anyone may be noticing and whether or not it is a risky thing to do."   Colleagues from the time say her participation in the march should not be seen as indicative of a broader involvement in the anti-apartheid movement which became known as the "struggle".   "She certainly wasn’t in the broad left, nor was she active at all in the fight against university apartheid," Alf Stadler told Scotland on Sunday. A student at the university from 1957 to 1961, Stadler went on to become a Professor of Political Studies at the institution.   Stadler maintains the protest in which Heinz Kerry was involved drew virtually the whole campus. "Everyone was on it, it was the formal protest of the university."   The protest, for which permission had been granted by the authorities, was led by the university’s vice-chancellor, W G Sutton, a man Stadler claimed was so cautious he virtually would not "leave his office without permission".   "A lot of students got clobbered," said Stadler, remembering some of the anti-apartheid protests on campus. But "not as many were involved in what eventually became known as ‘the struggle’ as pretended to be," he chuckled.   He said of Heinz Kerry’s references to her participation: "She’s trying to make some kind of personal role... but it’s not working."   "I don’t remotely see this lady as having indulged in that kind of thing," said Stadler, referring to a range of anti-government protests by students.   Situated on the edge of downtown Johannesburg, the Wits campus, as it is known, was a divided one. Fraught with political tensions, meetings in the Great Hall often broke out into fights. Some students’ anti-apartheid activity involved sneaking into the city centre at night, sticking up political posters, and attending rousing political rallies at the City Hall.   Some students went further, joining and forming organisations which led to their arrest, imprisonment, and "banning" - a process by which the government made it illegal for a person to be quoted or to be in the company of more than a few people at once. One former student, John Harris, who formed the Armed Resistance Movement, was hanged in 1965 for planting a bomb at Johannesburg’s railway station.   A senior South African politician who attended the university at the same time as Heinz Kerry and who was "banned" by the apartheid government for his political activities said he had "no recollection at all" of her.   Paleontologist Professor Phillip Tobias, one of the principal organisers of the march, says he does not remember Ferreira. But he added: "I do not think any student who went through those events could remain untouched by it. She must have been "sensitised in the fight against racism".   One of three children of a Portuguese doctor and his wife Irene Thierstien, Maria Teresa Thierstien Simoes-Ferreira was born in Mozambique, then a Portuguese colony, which gained its independence in 1974, 13 years after the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique began a guerrilla struggle.   Her primary school years at the Baraso Convent were interrupted when her father took the family back to Portugal, to further his medical studies. She returned to Africa for her high school years, from 1951 to 1956.   South Africa was at the time in the grip of a rising resistance to the relatively new racist rule of the Nationalist Party, which was settling in for a long reign. It was beginning to clamp down on anti-apartheid political organisations, including Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress.   At the end of an impressive high school career, Heinz Kerry went on to the University of the Witwatersrand, where she graduated with a BA in languages on March 26, 1960.   Heinz Kerry was known for her intellectual abilities and her devout Catholicism. She attended mass every morning at Roman Catholic Maris Stella Convent High School in the coastal city of Durban.   "She made quite a mark for herself," said the school’s headmistress, Eleanor Hough. Heinz Kerry received an award for academic excellence in her final year and was given the Old Girl’s Achievement Badge after having been judged "the most outstanding girl" at the school.   The American public is still trying to figure out what to make of Heinz Kerry. About four in 10 view her favourably, three in 10 unfavourably, and 27% said they haven’t decided, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll last week.   The unfavourables had increased from 19% in early July to 31% in a recent survey. Two-thirds view First Lady Laura Bush in a favourable light, 12% view her unfavourably.   In her adult life, Heinz Kerry has become a powerful woman, accustomed to speaking her mind. She is the head of the $1.2bn Heinz Foundation and her personal fortune is estimated to exceed $1bn.  A WORLD APART  When Teresa Heinz Kerry arrived in South Africa in 1951, the resistance to white minority rule was growing daily.   Political groups, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s passive resistance strategy, embarked on a campaign of defiance against unjust laws.   Just as the young Heinz Kerry was completing her glittering high school career, 156 activists, including Nelson Mandela, were arrested and charged with treason. The trial lasted longer than the period she spent at university. All were acquitted.   Five days before she graduated in 1960, police opened fire on a crowd of black people, killing 69 in the Sharpeville massacre. They had been protesting against mandatory ‘pass’ books.   Political groups, including the African National Congress were soon banned. In less than a year Mandela was jailed for leaving the country illegally, and in June 1964 he was jailed for life for sabotage.

       Hartford Advocate Sheila Gibbons    The women married to presidential and vice presidential candidates have become increasingly active in their husbands' campaigns and policies over the last century. But despite growing recognition by the press of their broadened role, some recent coverage doesn't seem to have caught on. The women are too often treated as decorative add-ons whose field of operations rarely extends beyond the strictly personal.  In the July issue of Washingtonian magazine, for instance, Russell Warren Howe chooses to emphasize Teresa Heinz Kerry's entertaining skills. "One place where tradition prevails is an old mansion on the 3300 block of O Street. You can sit down there at a table covered with fine linen -- a table to which servants bring cuisine on heated china plates, and where the hostess, Teresa Heinz Kerry, chooses the menu and directs the kitchen."   Howe, a former president of the Foreign Correspondents' Association of Washington, then goes on to compare Heinz Kerry to Pamela Harriman and manages to slight another influential woman by recalling Harriman as a legendary hostess and consort to famous men rather than in her role of a lifetime: ambassador to France.   In a June interview with the Kerrys, CBS News' Byron Pitts homes in on the couple's amorous side. Instead of getting Kerry to talk about the kinds of endeavors his wife has supported, or the kinds of interests that must hold such a power couple together, we hear Kerry describing his wife as "Saucy. Sexy. Brilliant." Heinz Kerry concurs. "I am sexy. I have got a lot of life inside," she tells Pitts. Pitts then manages to rub in all that ageist stuff about women over a certain age.   "You do not hear many 65-year-old women say they are sexy." Unfazed, Heinz Kerry pleasantly zings him back. "How many women of that age have you asked?" she said.   In her May 3 cover story for Newsweek, reporter Melinda Henneberger chooses to worry that the Kerrys aren't sticking closely enough to gender-role scripts.   "Does he [Kerry] worry that she communicates a perhaps too-European brand of confidence in herself as a 'lot of woman' -- at a time when he is being derided as 'looking French?'" This is psychological silliness and a strange fixation on appearances at a time when serious and substantial policy issues, such as how long U.S. forces are going to be in Iraq, might actually be on readers' minds.   Later in the article, headlined, "Teresa: Is John Kerry's Heiress Wife a Loose Cannon -- or Crazy Like a Fox?" Henneberger quotes Vanessa Kerry, the candidate's daughter, as rejecting the notion that her stepmother should be "muzzled." Speaking for many women, Vanessa Kerry said, "How offensive to her and to all women."   Even CNN's Judy Woodruff, a seasoned political journalist from whom we usually receive top-flight analysis, offered a disappointing take on first ladies. In a piece for Newsnight with Aaron Brown that aired the day Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate, Woodruff reduced recent first ladies to labels. She spoke of "controversial Hillarys," "glamorous Jackies" and "demure Lauras." Then she went on to assess one who could be next: "Teresa breaks the mold ... she's always outspoken ... hard to package and impossible to rein in ... Some in the senator's campaign say she speaks her mind too much."   Then Woodruff wrapped up the segment by commenting on the difference between Heinz Kerry's pumpkin spice cookie recipe ("different, an acquired taste") and Laura Bush's oatmeal chocolate chunk cookie recipe ("traditional") in a Family Circle readers' contest.   It's almost surreal that someone like Woodruff, who has carved a distinctive role for herself as a judicious journalist, would resort to the implication that cookie-recipe ingredients are metaphors for the women themselves. In the present strained geopolitical climate, weren't there other observations to be made about the important advisory and quasi-ambassadorial role played by the presidential partners?   Why the "qualifications" for first ladies get treated in such a narrow way confounds those of us who have considered their role.   In their review of the treatment of first ladies in textbooks on government and the presidency ("sporadic, spotty and sometimes non-existent"), Anthony Eksterowicz of James Madison University and Robert P. Watson of the University of Hawaii found that the activities and influence of the first ladies have become more overtly public and political over the 20th century.   "First ladies wield influence in private as behind-the-scenes advisers and in public as hostesses, advocates of charitable projects and as political operatives," they say.   Nevertheless, more than 200 years after Martha Washington originated the role, and more than 100 years after Edith Roosevelt became the first lady to obtain formal staff assistance, some reporting continues to pen these women into a no-win situation.   If she attends her husband's cabinet meetings, as did Rosalynn Carter, there's a suspicion that she's meddling in policy. If she chairs a policy committee, as did Hillary Rodham Clinton, she's labeled "co-president." If behind her interest in fashion and decorating is a single-minded devotion to her husband and a role as his closest adviser à la Nancy Reagan, she's a dragon lady who is to be feared.   But if she's absent from the campaign trail and occupied with her own pursuits, as physician Judith Steinberg Dean was during the Democratic primaries, the press speculates on her capacity to take on the role of first lady.   And if she's reserved and keeps her opinions to herself, that's noted as well, but only with the faintest of praise. Detroit News columnist Laura Berman, writing in 2001, said, "No first lady has ever seemed more blandly appropriate for the position than Laura Bush. If the cliché of the first lady is that of the supportive wife enhanced by careful dress, Mona Lisa-like smile, aptitude for background poses and well-chosen causes, Laura Bush fits and then some."   The media's critical and wary coverage of these women implies that independence and critical thinking in first ladies may be liabilities for their husbands and, by extension, the nation. It reflects a fundamental discomfort with women ascending to power at the sides of men who, by all accounts, need and love them for their smarts and their hearts; not their zipped lips and cookie recipes.

       The New York Times Ginia Bellafante   Teresa Heinz Kerry has presented herself to Americans as a multilingual free spirit, a woman with a taste for a 70's-era Jacqueline Bisset coiffure and a habit of tossing a sweater over her shoulders, as if her political outings demanded no more of her than patio luncheons in Nantucket. Her gold tank watch rests loosely on her wrist; her favorable position on millennial-era cosmetic enhancements remains a matter of record. Were she to take up residence in the White House as first lady in a John Kerry administration, no one would expect her to fade into the chintz.   She is in many ways a contrast to Laura Bush, who has sought above all to look imperturbably well-kempt. After nearly four stressful years in the White House, Mrs. Bush's smile remains dependably attractive, her hair neatly clipped and her neutral suits, one indistinguishable from the next, are as proper as schoolgirls' uniforms.   And so another battle of sorts has intensified following the Democratic National Convention — this one over the many contrasts in taste and appearance and comportment between the potential first ladies. It is a pageant that many might prefer did not exist, but which nonetheless occupies a corner of voters' minds.   In the popular view, the scrutiny and fascination with the style of first ladies began with Jackie Kennedy, and redoubled with Nancy Reagan and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But a focus on fashion is not so exclusively modern a preoccupation, either by the electorate or by first ladies themselves.   Fashion memorably concerned a number of presidential wives who predate the mid-20th century, a few of whom wielded a distinct influence over the tastes of American women at a time when the celebrity culture's tentacles were not yet so all-entangling.   Mrs. Kerry's look of vague aversion to the constraints of political life, in fact, might call to mind Grace Goodhue Coolidge who, as the wife of Calvin Coolidge, who served as president from 1923 to 1929, arrived in Washington to observations that she "kept her wits at the end of her tongue." With her lean frame, the result of a passion for hiking and swimming, Mrs. Coolidge was, in the opinion of the historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony, America's first ambassador of women's sportswear.   "It was the 1920's, Gertrude Ederle had swum the English Channel and there was this great sense of excitement about women and sports, and Grace Coolidge embodied this new athletic ethos," said Mr. Anthony, the author of several books about first ladies and life in the White House. Newsreels captured her in mountain gear at the couple's vacation home in the Black Hills of South Dakota. She adapted herself to flapper style in a manner so admired that she was awarded a gold locket by the couturier Charles Worth on behalf of the French garment industry.  Mrs. Coolidge adored red and named her dog Rob Roy as a sly show of disapproval of Prohibition. In the June 1927 issue of Vanity Fair, she was named to the magazine's Hall of Fame because, as the magazine said, "she is the first lady of the land and the wife of the President of the United States; because she is one of the best liked and most charming hostesses in Washington."  Few political wives, though, have ever commanded quite the sartorial attention that the country heaped upon Frances Folsom, who at the age of 22, on a June day in 1886, became the wife of President Grover Cleveland, a man who was nearly three decades her senior.   As early as the 1870's, the press was tuning in to what women were wearing to presidential inaugurations. But the arrival of Mrs. Cleveland created a new kind of frenzy about fashion. "The papers absolutely loved Frances Folsom," said Alden O'Brien, costume curator at the Museum of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Washington, "because she was so pretty and it was just so newsworthy and charming to have this incredibly young woman in the White House."  The press, to Mrs. Cleveland's distaste, nicknamed her Frankie. Many women began shaving the backs of their necks in emulation of her close-cropped haircut. "People always say, `Oh, Jackie was an American princess,' but Frances Cleveland really was," Mr. Anthony said.   Although she had not granted her consent, Mrs. Cleveland's image began to appear on a mind-boggling array of products from liver pills to women's undergarments. Her preference for shoulder-baring clothes managed to arouse the ire of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which petitioned her to dress more conservatively, saying that her style posed a threat to the chastity of young American women. Comparisons to Britney Spears do not seem out of place.  At one point during the Cleveland presidency, a gossip report declaring that Mrs. Cleveland had abolished the bustle from her wardrobe knocked the fashion industry on its head. According to "Presidential Wives: An Anecdotal History" by Paul F. Boller Jr., when Mrs. Cleveland read this fabricated item, she decided the rumor was not worth denying and stopped wearing bustles publicly.   Her affinity for the retail industry also showed itself in her habit of holding Saturday afternoon teas at the White House for department store clerks, a group that one White House official, Mr. Boller writes, called "that great rabble of shop girls."   Going back even further in American history, Dolley Madison, whose travels to Europe gave her a taste for the look of classical imperialism, managed to popularize turbans for women when she returned home. Her own turbans were decorated with bird of paradise feathers.  And consider too, the fame of Julia Gardiner Tyler, second wife of President John Tyler who married him while he was in office in 1844. A socialite of New York and East Hampton, Mrs. Tyler had been given the name the "Rose of Long Island" before she reached the White House.   Widely acknowledged to have been a great beauty, she had scandalized her family by appearing in an advertisement for a clothing merchant in 1839. A year later, she and her sister Margaret Gardiner had toured Europe, in search of vibrant social life and wealthy husbands. A chronicle of the trip was published in the 1920's as "Leaves from a Young Girl's Diary."  One suspects Mrs. Heinz Kerry would have had quite a time with the Gardiner girls, and probably improved their Italian, French and Spanish — and their Portuguese — to boot.

       AP Nedra Pickler   Forget polite sensibilities. Many women along the Democratic campaign trail are telling Teresa Heinz Kerry to keep speaking her mind. To them, the sassy, gabby wife of presidential candidate John Kerry is a key part of the package they want to put in the White House.      These women don't care that Heinz Kerry doesn't always follow the etiquette rules for potential first ladies. Like when she marches up to a persistent reporter and tells him to "shove it" or when she tells Republican hecklers that they want "four more years of hell."   Dawn Davis of Muscatine, Iowa, excitedly greeted Heinz Kerry as the tour came through her home state Wednesday. Davis says she isn't ashamed to acknowledge that she's been known to tell people to shove it and go to hell. Just thinking about all the criticism of Heinz Kerry was enough to get her going.   "Women should not feel that they should kowtow to anyone else's option," Davis said in a rapid-fire rant. "I told her, you keep speaking your mind and don't let them change you. They just criticize her because they don't have anything else to hang it on. And that's the truth."   Heinz Kerry's opinions have opened her husband to criticism. After Kerry joined his wife in responding to the hecklers by calling them Bush's "goons," the Republican National Committee put out a press release headlined, "Kerry's Positive Campaign? Goons Taking America To Hell."   First lady Laura Bush said that even though she's not likely to respond in kind to hecklers or reporters who make her angry, she can understand why Heinz Kerry does. "It's not easy when your husband runs for president," Bush said Tuesday night on Fox News Channel's "The O'Reilly Factor."   Heinz Kerry told a rally in Hannibal on Wednesday night that growing up in the African dictatorship of Mozambique has made her value her right to speak out as part of the democratic process.   "We have to get to a point in our story of America where we don't have to fight for the things that are ours, which is our voices," Heinz Kerry said. "Women have been an intrinsic and powerful part of the history of this country and it is time to listen to their wisdom."   A portion of the American public is still trying to figure out what to make of Heinz Kerry. About four in 10 view her favorably, three in 10 have an unfavorable opinion and 27 percent said they haven't decided how they feel about her, according to CNN-USA Today-Gallup polling.   The number who hold an unfavorable opinion of Heinz Kerry has increased from 19 percent in early July to 31 percent in a recent survey. Two-thirds view first lady Laura Bush in a favorable light while 12 percent view her unfavorably.   In her adult life, Heinz Kerry has become a powerful woman accustomed to having the leverage to speak her mind. She is the head of the $1.2 billion Heinz Foundation and has a personal fortune totaling hundreds of millions to more than $1 billion, depending on who is estimating.   Heinz Kerry usually campaigns on her own so that she and her husband can double the ground they cover in the campaign. This week, she's been by her husband's side as he tours the Midwest by bus.   "Here in Wisconsin, we appreciate women with strong opinions," Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin (news, bio, voting record) said as she introduced Heinz Kerry to an uproar of thunderous applause and hollering from female voices at an event in Beloit.   The crowd response was even louder than it was when her husband was introduced.   Kerry almost always introduces his wife by applauding her for saying what she thinks. And that includes when she's speaking to him.   When he suggested at the Beloit event that Heinz Kerry translate a question that was posed to her in her native tongue of Portuguese, she fired back, "Hello? I didn't get paid to be an interpreter here today."   The crowd laughed and so did Heinz Kerry, before she obliged and translated.   The two went on to Monroe, Wis., where they greeted workers at the Joseph Huber Brewing Co. As Kerry approached employee Lisa Mahlkuch for a handshake, she looked right past him and asked, "Where's Teresa?" Kerry pointed behind him and Mahlkuch started waving excitedly, dropping the hand of the presidential nominee without so much as another glance at him.   "I supported whatever you say!" Mahlkuch said as Heinz Kerry approached.   Asked later if she has a little of the same sass, Mahlkuch says, "I'm the only woman working with 31 men. What do you think?"   While in Monroe, Kerry and Heinz Kerry also visited Baumgartner's Cheese Tavern, where Heinz Kerry walked around the store with a Limburger cheese sandwich with raw onions and mustard on rye. She waved the stinky sandwich in the face of everyone around her.   "This is how I'm going to get some privacy on the bus," she said as people recoiled with scrunched-up noses.   Heinz Kerry explained that she doesn't like cheese unless it stinks. "Cheese that doesn't taste is just empty calories," she said.   Her cheese knowledge impressed Bruce Schuman and Leanne Wuthrich, a married couple from nearby Broadhead who frequent the tavern. But Heinz Kerry's knowledge of cheese isn't going to make Schuman vote for her husband.   "A lot of people like cheese," he said.

       Rapid City Journal   Everyone does things and says things they are sorry for, first lady Laura Bush observes. And she's not necessarily talking about plain-speaking Teresa Heinz Kerry.  "I think I had a little girl who stuck her tongue out at the press last week. I shouldn't have brought it up, but it happens," Bush said Wednesday on "The Early Show" on CBS. Daughter Jenna, 22, laughed and stuck out her tongue at news media July 20 during a campaign trip to St. Louis with her father.  Photographers caught the waggish pose as Jenna sat in the presidential limousine.  "I didn't actually know about it," her mother said. "I was hiking in Glacier National Park with no news, no telephones. So when I got off my hike I called her and she sort of went on about it like she was sure I knew about it, which I didn't."  Her advice to her daughter? "Maybe you should work on your issues of impulsiveness or something," she recalled.  Bush wouldn't offer similar advice to John Kerry's wife, who has told an insistent reporter to "shove it" and responded to Bush supporters' chants of "Four more years!" by saying "They want four more years of hell."  When asked if Heinz Kerry's "shove it" comment was appropriate, Bush said: "It's hard when your husband's running for president. It's hard to be scrutinized and to hear the criticisms, and I think that's really what the fact of the matter is in what she said."

       Palm Beach Post Editorial   Here's the most important point about Teresa Heinz Kerry in relation to the presidential election: She's not on the ballot.  We're not naive. We know that even if Mrs. Kerry isn't on the ballot, she's on the ticket, along with Elizabeth Edwards. On the other ticket are first lady Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney. Collectively, they form one of the smartest and most interesting groups of spouses to appear with yet another all-white-male main cast. It's fascinating to wonder what the campaign would be like if the roles were reversed. Certainly, one wouldn't have to fear for the country. If men had all the answers, most of the campaign's big issues wouldn't be issues at all.  But Mrs. Kerry won't be behind the desk in the Oval Office, just as Laura Bush doesn't run meetings in the Situation Room. Yet it seems that some voters always have a problem with the Democratic nominee's wife. This year, those who oppose John Kerry are making an issue of who he chose to marry.  Not knowing Mrs. Kerry any better than her critics, we will assume that there must be a lot of good about her because of how close she is to her three sons and two stepdaughters. We also will assume that about Mrs. Edwards, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Cheney, for similar reasons. And, clearly, they all are women made from strong stuff. Mrs. Kerry speaks five languages and runs the $1.2 billion foundation that carries the name of her first husband, the late Sen. John Heinz. Elizabeth Edwards has a law degree. Book-lover Laura Bush was called "comforter in chief" for her strong public role after the 9/11 attacks. Lynne Cheney chaired the National Endowment for the Humanities and served on the board of Juno Beach-based FPL Group.  However serene she looks in public, any first lady is her husband's bluntest and most protective adviser. At some point, it would be good for the country to accept that there is more to such a woman than the Adoring Gaze. That acceptance should come even before the gaze has to come from a man.

       The Miami Herald Elinor J. Brecher   When John met Elizabeth, he wore a "surfer-boy" haircut and Western shirts with pearly snaps.       On their first date, he took her to a loud bar where they could barely talk.   Plus, she was four years older.   "No way," thought Elizabeth Anania, a naval officer's daughter, now Elizabeth Edwards, the Democratic vice presidential candidate's wife. Then came the good night kiss: a peck on her forehead that changed everything.   "That was 1974, and there were not very many gentlemen," she recalled, following a campaign appearance Monday in Miami. "I thought that was the sweetest thing."

       AP   Teresa Heinz Kerry knows what her role is on the campaign - and she says it's not interpreter.  During a town hall meeting hosted by Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, a woman stood and said she had a question for his wife but she wanted to ask it in Portuguese. Kerry motioned for his wife to join him on stage and he held Heinz Kerry's hand as she listened and then responded in Portuguese.  When she was done, Kerry leaned in and whispered in his wife's ear. She pulled back and responded, "Hello? I didn't get paid to be an interpreter here today."  She laughed along with the crowd, then explained that the woman had thanked her for mentioning the Brazilian and Portuguese people at the Democratic National Convention last week.  Heinz Kerry's father was a Portuguese doctor working in the African country of Mozambique, where she was raised. Heinz Kerry said she also told the woman that she met Kerry at an environmental conference in Brazil in 1992.  "So for you environmentalists, we're together for the environment first," she said.  Heinz Kerry speaks five languages and was an interpreter at the United Nations when she first moved to the United States.

       AP Mary Dalrymple   Teresa Heinz Kerry, the outspoken wife of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, told a rally exactly what she thinks of the prospect of a second Bush term.   With a Bush supporter chanting "Four more years! Four more years!" through a bullhorn from the back of a park Monday evening, the candidate's wife stopped herself to respond. "They want four more years of hell," Heinz Kerry said.   The pro-Kerry crowd erupted in applause and began its own chant: "Three more months! Three more months."   Heinz Kerry quieted the audience so she could continue her remarks, which touched on her life, her husband and the importance of getting involved in political causes.   Kerry gave her a long hug and a big smile when she finished.   "She speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth, and she's pretty quick on her feet, too," Kerry said.   The Bush supporter didn't back down.   "Bush, Cheney! Bush, Cheney!" he said as Kerry started to speak.   At nearly every stop during the first days of Kerry's coast-to-coast tour, the candidate has praised his wife's tendency to speak her mind.   Last week, during the Democratic nominating convention in Boston, she told a persistent reporter to "shove it" and to stop misquoting her when he repeatedly asked her to expand on her call for more civility in politics.

       Salon Rebecca Traister July 28   As presumptive candidate for first lady Teresa Heinz Kerry took the stage at the Democratic National Convention Tuesday night, tottering on precariously high heels and wearing a suit in fire-engine, take-no-prisoners, Nancy-Reagan red, it felt a little like watching the Olympic gymnastics final competition. Would she hit her marks? Would she stay within the lines of competition? Would she complete the triple-back-flip dismount equivalent of referring to her husband as John Kerry, and not John Heinz?   She nailed it. And more than that, she elevated the sport of having the wife of a presidential candidate prove her mettle in front of party delegates from all fifty states to a new level.   The pressure she faced has been building over a year that has garnered her a reputation as unpredictable, dangerous, batty, and, as she put it on Tuesday, "opinionated." Heinz Kerry has already shown that she is a broad with a set of brass balls. She has steadfastly refused to shut up, cursed at inappropriate moments, talked about abortion and Botox, voiced her frustrations with a Republican party of which she was a long-time member, pulled little Jack Edwards' thumb out of his mouth in front of cameras, rhapsodized about her heartbreakingly obvious love for her dead husband John Heinz, and been unable to control her habit of looking like a distracted housecat during her husband's stump speeches. On Tuesday she told NPR's Susan Stamberg that not only had someone in her office supplied Family Circle's First Lady bake-off contest with her supposed recipe for pumpkin spice cookies, but that "somebody really made it on purpose to give a nasty recipe." "I never made pumpkin cookies," Heinz Kerry said. "I don't like pumpkin spice cookies." Her biggest headlines of this week's convention came after she got pissy with a reporter from a right wing Pittsburgh newspaper and told him to "shove it."   What all this has gotten her was a sweaty-palmed, high-anxiety build-up so dramatic that she could have feasibly made an Elvis-style walk through the Fleet Center hallways a la Bill Clinton in 2000. Instead, she appeared quietly after a touching introduction by her extremely handsome youngest son Chris Heinz. In her lilting accent she began by evoking the ever-present ghost of her first husband, and telling her sons that he would be very proud of them.   She greeted delegates in each of the five languages in which she is fluent. Then, rather than demonstrating how well she's been domesticated by Team Kerry, she talked about herself. She declined to discuss fireside chats with her husband, or his devotion to their Brady-Bunch batch of kids, or his penchant for renting Jim Carey movies, or something equally humanizing and fuzzy and dopey and controlled. Heinz Kerry instead told the nation about how she spent her student years in the late 1950's protesting the encroaching apartheid regime in Johannesburg, South Africa, and lost. "I learned something then, and I believe it still," she said. "There is a value in taking a stand whether or not anyone may be noticing and whether or not it is a risky thing to do."   It was a clever note to strike, since these days, everyone notices every stand this woman takes, and they are all more than a little risky. Then, almost unthinkably, she decided to use her platform to gracefully stick a shiv in everyone who has attacked her over the past week, and over the past months. Citing her credentials as an immigrant and naturalized citizen, Heinz Kerry voiced her "personal feeling" about America and about "how precious freedom is."   "My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called 'opinionated'" -- and here Heinz Kerry deployed killer air quotes -- "is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish. My only hope is that, one day soon, women -- who have all earned the right to their opinions -- instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are." It was a sentiment so simple that it was radical. Radical in that it returned to the most basic tenets of the feminist movement. It was about as obvious as that old t-shirt slogan: "Feminism is the radical notion that women are people."   Here was a woman -- with a foreign birth certificate, graduate degree, Republican resume, two husbands, three sons, and 500 million dollars in the bank - who has held fast to the most American and democratic of beliefs: that it is her right as a citizen to be her own wacked-out, Botoxed, pumpkin-cookie-hating, dead-husband-loving, Socratic self. But she has repeatedly been weighed on a scale set for women expected to whittle away their personalities until they are as anemic as their waists or their libidos. Even the smartest and most dynamic of our recent first ladies, and yes, I'm talking about the Senator from New York, have sometimes given in and allowed themselves to be shaped into what the pollsters say they need to be: content when they are really restless, reverent when they are really questioning, loving and supportive when they really want to take a pair of garden shears to their husband's wandering members.   Of course the speech was not all as invigorating as her discourse on women's rights -- her whispered tone and hypnotic cadence can get downright soporific. Things got a little worrisome when she started to talk about the Galileo and Hubble spacecrafts; she was, alas, briefly in orbit herself. But that's part of what this woman is: weird and rambly and generally unpredictable. In fact, if there were one real complaint about her appearance on Tuesday, it's that her husband's team of handlers seemed to have persuaded her to stay on script.   Commentators would soon start picking apart her performance: She didn't talk enough about her husband as a person; she was wonky; she was dry; she was quiet. A few generous observers did acknowledge that she looked hot. But in the end, she gave a speech that answered them all. Part of her point was that according to the principles that she and her husband advocate, she could have read the phone book on-stage for an hour. It is her right to speak at all -- and to say whatever she feels like saying -- that is at stake when we talk about questioning our government, participating in the process, demanding what we deserve from our leaders. Speaking of Kerry, Heinz Kerry said, "he believes that our voices -- yours and mine -- must be the voices of freedom. And if we do not speak, neither does she."   Let her keep speaking.

       Salon Geraldine Sealey July 28, 2004     Teresa Heinz Kerry didn't talk about her Botox, her prenup, or how good-looking John Edwards is. She didn't say she would give up her fortune to have her dead husband back, or tell George W. Bush to "shove it." But in her highly anticipated prime-time speech before the Democratic convention on Tuesday, she defended her right to say any or all of those things.   "My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry," she said. "And by now I hope it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have something to say."   In convention parlance, Heinz Kerry "stuck to the script." She's known for freewheeling ad-libs, but her speech was on teleprompter, a device she used for the first time. Although she penned her own remarks -- her husband read them beforehand -- all texts delivered from the podium had to be "vetted" by the campaign. Still, that didn't keep Teresa from being Teresa.   Indeed, her personality beamed through Democratic Party control. She is fluent in five languages and sampled them all with greetings in English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese. She captured the crowd by relating how she grew up in Mozambique under a dictatorship, and described how her upbringing and journey here as an immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen inspired her independence.   "My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called 'opinionated,' is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish," she said. "My only hope is that, one day soon, women -- who have all earned the right to their opinions -- instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are."   Above all, Heinz Kerry came to tell the American people why her husband should be president of the United States. Earlier this week, she was misunderstood when she remarked that no mortal is qualified to be president, although her husband "was pretty close to it." But now she spoke without qualifications.   Many Americans say they do not know enough about Kerry, and his wife's speech helped bridge the gap. After being warmly introduced by her son, Chris Heinz, she wove praise for "John" through a series of issues dear to her. A dedicated philanthropist, she oversees an estimated $1 billion fortune inherited when her late husband, ketchup heir and GOP Sen. John Heinz, died in a plane crash.   "With John Kerry as president, global climate change and other threats to the health of our planet will begin to be reversed," she said. "With John Kerry as president, the alliances that bind the community of nations and that truly make our country and the world a safer place, will be strengthened once more."   Heinz Kerry stayed dignified and elegant -- like "a great European actress," someone on CNN said -- but got in a passing swipe at rival George W. Bush. "John is a fighter," she said. "He earned his medals the old-fashioned way -- by putting his life on the line for his country."   But her performance was being scrutinized not for what she would say about Kerry so much as whether she would go "off-message." On Sunday, Heinz Kerry was caught on camera in a confrontation with an editorial writer for a Pittsburgh newspaper owned by right-wing philanthropist and Whitewater figure Richard Mellon Scaife. She eventually told the journalist, as everyone in America has no doubt heard by now, to "shove it."   She and the campaign then endured two days of endless questioning in the media -- "Is Teresa Heinz Kerry an asset or a liability?" -- just in time for the Democrats' big moment. But Kerry himself seemed unfazed by the "shove it" affair. "I think my wife speaks her mind appropriately," he said on Monday.   In an interview with CBS, Heinz Kerry spoke for herself passionately and persuasively. "I defended my rights," she said. "I defended my freedom and personally I defended my integrity, and I think any American would do that. And I would certainly applaud them for doing that and find them very weak if they didn't."   Heinz Kerry has made clear that as a political wife, she will not be boxed in, focus grouped and stifled with a tight smile and a stiff wave. When stumping for her husband, she is known for making creative and daring statements like this argument for condom use: "I keep saying that if you're really Christian ... you want an alive body that you can make into a Christian, rather than a dead one that's hopeless."   Heinz Kerry's authenticity and originality are characteristics many Americans admire, or say they admire, in political figures. When John McCain delivers unexpected, unscripted moments, he is called a "maverick." But when Teresa Heinz Kerry speaks her mind, she is called "kooky," "bizarre," "offbeat," and a potential vote-killer for her husband. This double standard is not lost on Heinz Kerry.   But the media fascination with Heinz Kerry also stems from how she stands in contrast to bland political personalities. Campaigns are so choreographed these days -- especially the conventions -- even the slightest excitement is enough to perk up reporters whose eyes have long ago glazed over. Hours before Heinz Kerry's speech, CNN's Anderson Cooper asked Kerry's stepdaughter, Vanessa Kerry, if she thought the "shove it" brouhaha resulted from "reporters with nothing else to report." Vanessa, clearly tired of the controversy, replied, "Yes, actually."   It may also be that reporters just don't know what to do with Heinz Kerry. "Because she is so unique she is an unusual commodity for the press," Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said. "But it's really what the American people will say. They want someone who cares, who has a heart, and who speaks her mind, and that is what she does."   But outspoken, passionate and frank women are also often -- still -- threatening and polarizing. Just ask Hillary Rodham Clinton. Heinz Kerry's poll numbers aren't quite as divided as the former first lady's, but an ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that Heinz Kerry had twice the unfavorable rating as Laura Bush: 26 percent had an unfavorable view of Heinz Kerry; 12 percent of Bush.   And Laura Bush doesn't have to contend with negative media coverage as does Heinz Kerry, who has faced pressure to release her tax returns. The Scaife-owned Tribune-Review has been on her case publishing factually dubious "investigative" pieces on her estate and charities that have migrated into other conservative publications. And Tuesday, a 1976 story from the Boston Herald surfaced with critical comments she made then about Ted Kennedy, prompting both the Kerry campaign and Kennedy's office to say they were all good friends and that the excavation of the 30-year-old story was the work of Republicans.   Howard Dean, who knows a thing or two about impassioned and spontaneous outbursts, and whose wife, Judy, was also dissected and labeled by the media, came to Heinz Kerry's defense at a Take Back America conference Tuesday afternoon. He pointed out the "shove it" hype and reminded listeners that the Pittsburgh paper was owned by Scaife. "That trumps the Boston Herald," he said. Dean shook his head, chuckled, and compared the Herald to the National Enquirer. To the roar of the crowd, he said, "Kerry's gonna win the election because of his wife. She's fantastic, isn't she?"   The delegates at the Fleet Center seemed to agree, the thunder of their applause filling the hall. "There is a value in taking a stand whether or not anyone may be noticing and whether or not it is a risky thing to do," Heinz Kerry was saying. "And if even those who are in danger can raise their lonely voices, isn't more required of all of us, in this land where liberty had her birth?"

       Daily Press Kathleen Parker   "How do you solve a problem like Tere-zah?"  All week I've been whistling the tune from "The Sound of Music," mentally substituting the name Teresa for Maria.  "How do you catch a cloud and pin it down? How do you find a word that means Teresa? A flibbertijibbet! A will-o'-the-wisp! A clown!"   Not that Mrs. Kerry is any of the above — far from it — but finding the right word to describe this unconventional potential first lady has spinmeisters and wordsmiths politely stumped. Democrats' protests to the contrary, she is a bit of a problem for the man who would be president.  It isn't so much the content of her recent "shove it" remark to a reporter, which doubtless millions applauded in vicarious appreciation, but rather what her volatile reaction suggests about Mrs. Kerry's temperament and a clear sense of entitlement that precludes all but acquiescence from the hoi polloi.  Suffice it to say that people with a billion dollars at their fingertips don't hear much from "No-men," while the need for grace under fire rarely comes up.  Mrs. Kerry's now-familiar "shove it" comment followed remarks to the Pennsylvania delegation during which she lamented creeping incivility in public life, noting that "un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits" are infecting politics. As if to demonstrate the point, she told a reporter to "shove it" after he asked her to clarify what she meant by "un-American activity."  An exasperated Mrs. Kerry denied ever saying "un-American," told him to "shove it" and huffed away. It wasn't precisely Cheney-esque, but no one would confuse the ketchup heiress with Laura Bush.  No matter how hard the Kerry camp spins her outburst, regular folk — those so beloved by the two-Americas, two-John ticket — see it as behavior unbecoming a first lady. As matters evolved, Mrs. Kerry's speechwriters came up with a clever way to mute the controversy by introducing a feminist conceit and opening the floor to discussion of the more politically palatable question of equality.  Mrs. Kerry isn't arrogant or abrasive, as some might have inferred. Why, she's a woman of deeply held conviction and a champion of free speech. Voila! Salud! And molto bene, while we're at it.  Addressing the Democratic Convention Tuesday night, Mrs. Kerry gamely hinted at her outburst, inviting a group wink, laughter and cheers: "By now, I hope it will come as no surprise that I have something to say."  Then she burnished the raw image of a bullying rich woman with brush strokes of gilded rhetoric:  "My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called 'opinionated,' is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish," she said, "and my only hope is that one day soon, women, who have all earned the right to their opinions, instead of being called opinionated will be called smart and well-informed — just like men."  Hear, hear, though I'm not sure that telling a reporter to "shove it" qualifies as smart and well-informed. Never mind that hoping women can have a public voice is about 30 years late. What's next, bra-burning?  First ladies continue to baffle us as we try to sketch an appropriate image in a world of evolving gender roles. We want someone strong yet feminine, accomplished but not too ambitious, maternal and wifely, but not smothering and subservient. Recent first ladies have run the gamut.  Nancy Reagan was viewed as too doting, gazing like a Labrador at her master, while Hillary Clinton wasn't "wifely" enough, famously displaying her Rodham charm by declaring that she wasn't the stay-at-home, cookie-baking sort.  The two Mrs. Bushes earn consistently high ratings among both Democrats and Republicans. The senior Mrs. Bush is everybody's no-nonsense mom — strong, kind and humorous. As for Laura, what's not to like? An attractive, feminine librarian, she's an utterly uncontroversial Tollhouse wife and mother who enjoys reading to kids and publicly defers to her husband without seeming obsequious.  Then comes Teresa, a native of Mozambique talking about un-American traits, an extraordinarily wealthy woman who, whatever charms she may possess, clearly isn't used to playing by the usual rules of civility toward lesser mortals. The rich really are different than the rest of us, but the smart and well-informed ones let the little guys believe otherwise.  At least until their husbands get elected to the White House.

       Bluefield Daily Telegraph Barbara Hawkins   Senators John Kerry and John Edwards want to return the United States to a high point in moral authority - a beacon in international relations, Mrs. Elizabeth Edwards said during a telephone interview with the Daily Telegraph during a Wheeling campaign stop Saturday night.  Speaking out about the Iraq war, the wife of the Democratic vice presidential candidate said the goal of the Democrats will be to regain the nation's international role, rebuild alliances, get the "targets" off the American military and the bill-paying hand out of American taxpayers "pockets."  Although her voice was slightly raspy from the night air along the river in Wheeling, she was excited about the reception for presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and her husband, Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., who is vice president on the Democratic ticket. They, along with Theresa Heinz Kerry, the Kerry and Edwards children and staff members were preparing to board their campaign bus to Zanesville, Ohio.  "That's the hometown of Zane Gray," she said. "We are so excited about the turnout here in Wheeling. They said it was 15,000 people and this town only has 35,000 residents in it. Earlier today we had between 20,000 and 25,000 in Harrisburg, Pa. A police officer told me it was the largest crowd they had since John Kennedy campaigned there."   Edwards - a lawyer who met her husband in law school and the mother of four children who live in a town of about 1,000 residents in North Carolina, said she understands the economic depression the candidates have witnessed in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  "We see the need for jobs everywhere," she said. "In our hometown the mill where John's Dad worked is closed, the lace factory has closed, the chicken factory closed and the mobile home factory has closed. All those workers lost their jobs.  "We see it all across this country ... the need for jobs ... we recognize it ... and we have seen it in our lives too," she said.  She said one of the targets of the Democratic nominees will be economic responsibility throughout the United States.  "Both Sen. Kerry and John are fiscal conservatives," she said. "Sen. Kerry voted for the balanced budget amendment and is concerned about the deficit. He wants to make certain we conduct ourselves as fiscal conservatives, because that's what we are. He has pledged to spend taxpayer money responsibly. My husband feels the same way."  She recalled that in the year 2000, Allen Greenspan said he "didn't know if it was good to have zero national debt." She laughed saying, "It's going to take a lot of discipline but the deficit has to be tackled again."  Edwards, who introduced her husband at the Democratic convention Wednesday night and obviously relishes the campaign activities, said not only with the team of Kerry and Edwards attack the national economy and seek to provide jobs for the people and economic stability for the country, "Sen. Kerry has a real plan to regain our international role high ground which this country has always been known for until now ... We have the greatest economy in the world and are the greatest military power in the world, we need to be sure our government behaves in the same way. We will return moral authority. We will be a beacon in international relations."

       Los Angeles Times Robin Abcarian    Teresa Heinz Kerry is a political wife unlike any this country has seen. But can she affect an election? Some think it's possible.   An heiress to immense wealth after being widowed by a Republican senator from Pennsylvania and now married to another senator — Democratic presidential nominee John F. Kerry — the 65-year-old Heinz Kerry is a philanthropist who is foreign-born and unafraid to speak her mind. And as this year's fight for the White House enters its final months, she increasingly evokes curiosity and interest.    Heinz Kerry's nationally televised speech at the Democratic National Convention was among the most anticipated moments of the four-day event. "My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry," she began. "And by now, I hope it will come as no surprise that I have something to say."    Indeed, that notion has become a minor theme of the Kerry campaign. He made brief note of her outspokenness in his nomination acceptance speech Thursday. And on Saturday, in Greensburg, Pa., Kerry told a cheering crowd, "Teresa, she speaks her mind, and she speaks the truth, and we love her for that."    For President Bush (news - web sites) and his campaign, however, such references to Heinz Kerry may be welcome news.    Republicans long have viewed First Lady Laura Bush, a former librarian with a low-key manner, as a political asset to the president. And throughout his term, Bush routinely has invoked her name in political speeches. On Saturday in Pittsburgh, he said: "Today you'll hear some reasons why I think you need to put me back into office. But perhaps the most important reason of all is so that Laura will be first lady for four more years."    The self-deprecatory line almost always draws a chuckle from Bush's crowds. But it may now resonate even more, given the differences between Laura Bush and Heinz Kerry — differences GOP strategists think could work to the president's advantage.    Bush campaign advisor Mary Matalin said of Heinz Kerry: "One thing is irrefutable — she is a distraction. She's one of those polarizing people."    But Democratic pollster Celina Lake predicts Heinz Kerry will prove an asset to her husband's White House hopes, especially among single women.    Lake, who has polled on the issue, said single women responded favorably to "strong, independent" women, such as Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (news - web sites) (D-N.Y.). "I think Teresa will be wildly popular with them," Lake said. "I think she could have an impact on increasing turnout."    Most voters, of course, decide who to support based on their attitudes toward the presidential contenders, not their families. Still, for some, such attitudes can be influenced by reactions to those near and dear to a candidate.    Both campaigns "are trying to find a way to spin this first lady thing to their advantage," University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said, but he considered such efforts a stretch in terms of their effect on the election.    A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that Heinz Kerry's unfavorable rating, 26%, was more than double that for Laura Bush — 12%. Nearly half, 47%, had no opinion about Heinz Kerry.    It is too soon for polling data to accurately measure reaction to Heinz Kerry following the Democratic convention. Based on anecdotal evidence, however, women seem to have responded more enthusiastically to her than men.    "She seems very bright," said Sally Williams, 29, who lives in suburban Chicago and plans to vote for Kerry. "My brother and husband thought she was kind of a know-it-all. Ah, men."    That divide, if widespread, could prove a double-edged sword for the Democrats. As pollster Lake's comments indicate, party activists think larger turnout by unmarried women could significantly benefit Kerry. In the 2000 election, more than 21 million single women — almost half of those eligible — did not vote.    But the Democratic ticket also is hoping to run better among white males than did party nominee Al Gore (news - web sites) four years ago. Among this group of voters, polls showed Bush bettered Gore by 24 percentage points.    Heinz Kerry's message as a campaigner — though sometimes rambling — is usually tailored to women.   On Friday, she told a crowd of about 15,000 in Pennsylvania: "It is long past due that the voices of women be heard. In full and at last. The women, the grandmothers, the great-grandmothers, the mothers and wives, they are the caregivers, the caretakers of this planet. Listen to them."   One undecided voter who has been paying close attention to the campaign is Doris Blankinship, a 47-year-old AT&T customer representative from Orlando, Fla. A registered Republican who voted for Bush in 2000, she enjoyed Heinz Kerry's speech on Tuesday and said that the candidate's wife might affect her vote.   Blankinship was impressed by Heinz Kerry's references to being an immigrant. "She wants our country to be strong, she wants our country to do well."   By contrast, she said, "I'm not really impressed by Laura Bush. She's for education and she cares, but she's kind of out of the loop. She doesn't seem to be as involved with things as Ms. Kerry."   But Albert Marshall, a 41-year-old marketing manager from Dallas, was underwhelmed by Heinz Kerry's speech.   "She didn't strike me as particularly comfortable," said Marshall, who did not vote in 2000 and hasn't decided whom to support this year. "I guess I would have expected more [in the speech] about her husband and what a great guy he was, and frankly she did very little of that."   Marshall said he wouldn't base his choice in November on a candidate's spouse or family. "I guess if she did something stupid, maybe…. But I don't think she did."   At a suburban St. Louis shopping mall, lawyer Kim Coffman, 33, said she admired Heinz Kerry, but thought her candor could turn off some voters.   "I think there's a fear, particularly among men, that she's going to run the show," Coffman said as she pushed her 18-month-old son in a stroller. "So I think she's a potential liability for Kerry, if men — or even women — view her as threatening."   Coffman said she was still undecided in the Bush-Kerry race.   Some voters responded negatively after Heinz Kerry, in view of TV cameras and reporters, told the editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on July 24 to "shove it" as he pressed her with a question she thought misconstrued remarks she had made moments before. The Tribune-Review, owned by billionaire Republican Richard Mellon Scaife, and Heinz Kerry have long been at odds.   Linda Volkman, 55, a craft maker in St. Louis, had always voted for Democrats until 2000. She plans to vote again for Bush, and said she found Heinz Kerry's outburst crass. "She has a lot of money and no class," Volkman said.   Meredith Collins, 52, an administrative assistant in Seattle, said she would vote for Kerry, but she was concerned that the run-in with the journalist suggested that Heinz Kerry was "not media savvy enough." Telling someone to "shove it," said Collins, "is a long way from Jackie Kennedy."   During her speech Tuesday, Heinz Kerry shared some of her own history, touching on her childhood in Mozambique living under a dictatorship. But when she spoke of her husband, it was to emphasize his positions on topics such as national security and global climate change, not his personality.   Many political experts said that as a result, she failed to accomplish what they thought should be her primary mission: to humanize her husband.   "People would have identified with hearing her say, 'I have a great husband, and I have been lucky twice,' " Sabato said, referring to Heinz Kerry's first marriage to the late Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.).   Sabato added: "This is America; schmaltz sells."   Reaction also was mixed to what was the most quoted line in Heinz Kerry's convention speech.   To thunderous applause from her audience, Heinz Kerry said: "And my only hope is that one day soon, women who have all earned their right to their opinions, instead of being called opinionated, will be called smart and well informed, just like men."   Ruth Mandel, an expert on politics and gender at Rutgers University in New Jersey, thought many women reacted positively. To what she called Heinz Kerry's, "I am woman, hear me roar" passage.   Sabato thought that some men saw it as "feminist state of the world comment, and they were threatened by it."   Matalin found the line "a bit of a throwback to victimology feminism."   Matalin added: "I've been called outspoken all my life. It's a badge of honor."

       Canton Rep Charita Goshay   If you were to ask Laura Bush for the time, she wouldn’t tell you how to make a watch, but make no mistake — she could.  Smart and congenial, tough-minded and gracious, Mrs. Bush is well-liked and respected, even among people who wish she was married to someone else.  It was she who gently tamped down the president’s “dead-or-alive” gunslinger rhetoric immediately following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  Though Laura Bush stands by her man, she does not march in lock step with him. She is a reader and thinker. He is curiously uncurious. She supports a woman’s right to choose. He does not, but she’s smart enough not to allow others to make an issue of it.  Sen. John Kerry may indeed be a war hero, but there sometimes is a flicker of fear in his eyes. Why? Because unlike President Bush, Kerry can never be quite certain what his wife, Teresa, is going to say.  A billionaire bombshell who’s also a bomb thrower, Teresa Heinz Kerry is unlike anything American politics has seen. Depending on your view, she can be a breath of fresh air, or a tempest. That’s because unlike her husband, she means what she says and says what she means, damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.  While Heinz Kerry’s outspokenness may well serve as source of amusement for us civilians, for political operatives, it is the stuff of which nightmares are made.  Camp Kerry seems to have long given up the ghost in trying to mold Heinz Kerry into a Stepford Wife, deciding instead to hold their collective breath and “Let Teresa be Teresa.”   As a result, fat chance that the editorial writer whom she told to “Shove it!” will get an apology or a chance to redeem himself for allegedly misquoting her.  Someone forgot to tell Heinz Kerry that when it comes to first ladies, Americans are flip-floppers. We say we value smart, opinionated women ... as long as they keep it to themselves and live somewhere other than 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., where some of the current staffers probably cross themselves and avoid looking directly into the eyes of Hillary Clinton’s portrait as they walk by.  As an immigrant who grew up under a dictatorship, Heinz Kerry took us at our word when we said that Americans have a right to speak their minds — even a politician’s wife.  When rumors surfaced about a possible affair between John Kerry and a young intern, unlike stoic Hillary Clinton, Heinz Kerry publicly declared she would maim any husband of hers who suffered from a case of the wandering eye.  One must assume that such a woman is more than enough for any man.  The current sniping at Heinz Kerry was curiously absent when she was a Republican senator’s wife who referred to Democrats as “scum,” and Sen. Edward Kennedy as “a perfect bastard.”  Though things obviously have changed, Kennedy won’t get an apology, either.  Such frankness is enough to give Beltway matrons the vapors.   They may have to get used to it.

       Irish Independent Lisa DePaulo   AT THE Democratic convention in Boston last week, 60-year-old John Kerry officially accepted his party's nomination as presidential candidate. Is he finally about to become the star of his own movie? Or will someone who has always been more exciting, charismatic and controversial once again get all the attention? Well, yes, someone probably will. And not just Bill Clinton - who gave the prime-time speech on day one of the convention - but also Kerry's wife, who, unusually for a candidate's spouse, had a prominent speaking role. But then Teresa Heinz Kerry is a most unusual political wife.   March 2003: As her private plane, the Flying Squirrel, lands in Newark, New Jersey, one of her aides is already on the ground, and visibly nervous. On this day Teresa Heinz Kerry is not only trying out her new name, she's also making her maiden solo voyage on the Democratic presidential campaign trail for her husband. Which in itself is cause for alarm. Will she remember to call this one, which is to say the live one, the one running for president, her husband? For months now, the press has been on poor Teresa's case for her seeming inability to keep her husbands straight. Her staff have had to remind her - coach her - to please use the phrase "my late husband" when referring to the deceased Senator John Heinz III, to whom she had been married for 25 years when he died in a plane crash in 1991 and with whom she had three children. But that she continued to call her first husband her husband (it's a Catholic thing), and not the current Senator John, apparently was not going to fly in a presidential campaign.   "There is a supposition," says Teresa, "that you can't love more than one person. I mean, mothers love many children at once. If you grow up with somebody and love them, of course you miss them. He taught me aboutlife. He gave me three sons. What the hell, I will always love him."   Immediately after Jack Heinz's death - she calls Heinz "Jack" and Kerry "John" - Teresa (pronounced Te-ray-zah) was thrust into the role of head of the Heinz family, whose ketchup fortune started in a pickle jar in Pittsburgh. She inherited an enormous sum, an estimated $550m at the time (Jack Heinz was an only child). The Los Angeles Times has put her current worth at more than $1bn. She also inherited the responsibility of running the family's billion-dollar-plus worth of charities. She's utterly devoted to the cause.   But the rumbling in political circles is that Teresa Heinz Kerry is a "loose cannon", too "outspoken", too "opinionated". Reporters call it "the Teresa issue". Of course, has there ever been an American First Lady candidate who wasn't put through the wringer, either for saying too much or not enough? Yet, even inside the Kerry campaign they're worried about things like . . . her hair. Compliment her fabulously unruly mane of coppery brown curls - which, let's face it, not a lot of 65-year-olds can pull off - and she replies, "That's not what [the campaign people] say!" She admits that "this is hardly the First Lady's hairdo", but she likes it. (And styles it herself.) "This isn'texactly 'the rules' for First Ladydom," she says. Perhaps the rules can be changed?"I have to get there first."Then there is the matter of the Gaze. Despite being married to her second senator, Teresa apparently missed the class where you learn how to do the fawning, doe-eyed wifely stare. Even Hillary got that one right. While Kerry delivers stump speeches, sheoften stands awkwardlybeside him onstage, fidgeting with a hairclip or her wire-rimmed glasses or the Chanel bag that always hangs from her shoulder, her expression suggesting she'd rather bein Pittsburgh.   She has also been known to tap him on the arm in mid-speech to correct him. This may be particularly dicey, because word on the Kerrys is that they fight like Taylor and Burton. "Fight or argue?" Teresa corrects. "Debating" the weighty issues of the world, which is what she says they do, is "a good thing, no?"   And in fact, when you see the Kerrys together, theintense bond between them - not to mention the sexual chemistry - is hard to miss. Quite frequently you'll see them nuzzling each other's necks in rapt whisper, his enormous paw around her shoulders pulling her close. But not always. At one recent fundraiser, two important donors separately remarked that she sure looked annoyed with her husband as she satin a corner glowering while Kerry revved the crowd from the podium. "I was exhausted," she says later. "They think I should always be looking adoringly at him."She sighs.   TERESA will tell you her husband is best "when being shot at", and that definitely proved to be true in the Democratic primaries. But it could also describe Mrs Kerry, who was unfazed when rumours exploded in the press last February that Kerry had had an affair with an intern. The gossip soon proved untrue, but for a while all eyes were on Teresa. Would she crumble? She wouldn't even dignify the rumours with a comment. Teresa has been a gift to the American press, tossing off lines like this one to the style magazine W - that the idea of being First Lady sounded "worse than going to a Carmelite convent". Imagine such bons mots spewing from the mouth of the poised Laura Bush, who has yet to utter anything more controversial than the fact that she likes to read books. Not surprisingly, it was Teresa, not Laura, who was the subject of a Newsweek cover headline that asked, 'Wife a Loose Cannon - or Crazy Like a Fox?'   In fact, as John Kerry enters the final stage of the battle for the White House, two things are clear about his wife: she is not going to change, and she could just be the most interesting and controversial First Lady ever.   Back in Newark, a hundred or so Democratic Women for Kerry are gathering to meet the lady they hope will be the next First Lady. They're well versed on his resume: the Vietnam War record (he is, as he likes to point out, the only candidate actually to have fought in a war) and all the other macho stuff. (He owns guns! He windsurfs! He's hot!) And thank goodness,because it nicely counteracts the "liberal from Massachusetts" tag that they knowis unhelpful. More important, of course, they see him aspro-women.   "Look, he's not Clinton, but who is?" says one woman. But as another quietly notes, maybe he won't have Bill's problem, either.   The Democratic women get their $125 worth as the candidate's wife covers everything from the problems to be faced in postwar Iraq (which she presciently says will be bad) to the Bush tax cut ("It benefited me. But I don't need it or deserve it") to why a woman should buy Clinique sunscreen (it doesn't have the nasty ingredient octyl methoxycinnamate that, based on her research - and she researches everything, sometimes late at night on Google - is bad bad bad).   To listen to Teresa is to get an education on all things great and small. (Did you know that "rabbit is the healthiest meat you can feed a child"?) Lately, the topics include prostate cancer, with which John Kerry was diagnosed in 2003 - although it was Teresa, not the doctors, who carefully monitored his PSA test results and recognised the problem. (The cancer was detected at an early enough stage to be removed by surgery.)   Chris Black, a former CNN reporter, was brought on board as Teresa's chief of communications in September 2002, rather urgently, after disaster struck in the form of a Washington Post article.   In Mark Leibovich's profile of the Couple Kerry, Teresa picks a fight (or was it anargument?) with Kerry in the presence of the reporter (she will later gripe that he was in their company for only "12 minutes", but apparently that was enough), admits to keeping a shrine to her deadhusband, talks about how one of her sons "hates" her, implies that she's had more difficulty in her life than Kerry - who served two tours in Vietnam - and generally left the impression that John Kerry did not measure up to Jack Heinz. And possibly not toTeresa either.   When the article came out, she went into a panic for two weeks, then realised "she needed help", says one friend. She discovered, says another, that she "needs to learn to self-edit", that she couldn't just say anything, because what she meant and how it came across could be two very different things. Like the shrine. It is true that she keeps photos of Heinz in each of her five homes but, as one of her friends convincingly argues, "Imagine, if your father died tragically, then your mother remarried and got rid of allhis pictures."   The real problem is that Teresa cannot be reduced to soundbites. She has lived a life almost unbelievable in its extremes - extreme ill fortune and extreme good fortune. To appreciate Teresa is to realise that everything she does, everything she is, is driven by both the losses and the loves. She is a person who can be at once hot and cold, modern and old-fashioned, beguiling and distant, selfless and self-absorbed, earthy and grand. She is also a person who would undoubtedly do great things if installed in the White House, because she would simply have to.   Exhibit A is her handling of the Heinz endowments. Teresa doesn't just give away huge amounts of money; she does it passionately and personally. Typical are the Heinz Awards, quarter-million-dollar grants given annually to scientists and artists chosen by Teresa. Outside the family business, she has taken on other causes, such as a seniors' prescription-drug programme that Teresa, a private citizen, pioneered and drove through the Massachusetts legislature. Yet she has no "political agenda" for herself, friends point out. What they mean is that she isn't Hillary.   "She's not trying to be co-anything," her husband says. "She's my wife and she's helping, but she wants to pursue the things that define her."   The funny thing about Teresa's meandering speech in Newark is that the women in the room are enthralled by it. When it ends, almost all of them jockey to greet her and ask her more questions.   Soon after, she is whisked off to the next event, at the Portuguese Sport Club. The local Portuguese community, which has put out a buffet of home-made food, is thrilled that Teresa has come to talk to them, as she is no doubt the only candidate's wife who can actually speak to them in Portuguese. Teresa speaks five languages fluently, but this is her native tongue. As she tells the crowd, she was born and raised in Mozambique, the daughter of a Portuguese doctor whom she would accompany on weekends into the bush to treat the poor.   The former Maria Teresa Thierstein Simoes-Ferreira vividly remembers accompanying her father, a well-to-do oncologist, on the days when he'd venture into the poorest regions of Southern Africa, where "people would walk miles and miles and miles" so that their children could be treated for all kinds of terrifying illnesses.   "You know," she tells me one day, sitting in her elegant Georgetown townhouse with her collection of Dutch masters on the walls and snapshots of Jack and John scattered in silver frames around her, "some of my happiest times were in the bush -with a cement floor and a thatched roof, taking care of sick people. So I always knew that if I didn't have my wealth I could still be happy doing that. And that's a very, very comforting thought."   Her father wanted her to become a doctor. "Now I regret that I didn't," she says. But she didn't believe at the time "that women could be successful mothers and wives and doctors".   Much as she worshipped her father's work, she also aspired to her mother's role. "What did she do?" she repeats a bit testily. "She was my mother. She was her husband's wife, her father's daughter." When Teresa was a teenager, her mother was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that left one side of her face deformed, despite 26 operations in 40 years. Teresa says, "I remember going with her to the doctor and her saying, 'Don't make my grandchildren frightened. Just make me look all right.'" The cancer spread to her brain and she died five years ago, at Teresa's Pittsburgh home.   After boarding schools (she was taught by British nuns in South Africa), Teresa studied Romance languages at a Johannesburg college, then went to the University of Geneva's School of Translation and Interpretation. It was there that she met the dashing Heinz, who was taking a year off from Harvard Business School to work at a Swiss bank. Both were 24. They'd just started dating when she got a call that her only sister, Gita, had been in a car accident in Lisbon. "Her last words to me were, 'You're going to marry Jack.' She was dead the next day."   Teresa had to go to Lisbon to identify the body. Then she moved back to Mozambique to be with her parents, but continued a very long-distance romance with Heinz.   Mourning was already an integral part of the Simoes-Ferreira household. Several years before Teresa was born, her father was driving a car that crashed.   He survived but her aunt didn't. "It changed his character," Teresa says. It got worse after her sister's death. "He let the pain control him. Not control him," she corrects; he still did the work she so admired him for, but he let the "pain stay there in a way that made him despondent". For 56 years, until he died in 1986, her father wore a black tie every day. The only exception was Teresa's wedding to Heinz in 1966, when she begged him to wear a blue tie she had picked out in Paris. He did, just for the wedding. "I wanted him to get out of that," Teresa says. "It's not that you don't feel pain. But you have to put it in a place, then go on with life."   The day Heinz's plane crashed in 1991, into a school yard in Philadelphia while he was travelling the state on senate business, Teresa had just turned 52. She and Heinz were devoted to each other. Not that they didn't havetheir problems, says Teresa, particularly in the earlyyears of their marriage when she was holed up on the Heinz farm in Pittsburgh. Shehad never been to America before meeting Heinz. "I was alone on the farm. I had no friends, no family in this country. He went to work at seven in the morning."   She says she got out of her slump by making babies. In six years she gave birth to three sons and wanted more. But three other pregnancies ended in miscarriages. One, in 1984, put Teresa in a difficult position. She was, and is, a pro-choice Catholic. But it's not just rhetoric. When she was 46, she became pregnant after taking cortisone for an allergy and doctors advised that the baby was likely to be born deformed. After much agonising, she arranged an abortion. Then, two days before the procedure was due to be performed, she - "thank God" - miscarried.   It was Heinz who first introduced his wife to Kerry inthe spring of 1990. It was a year before Heinz's death and both senators were speaking on the Mall in Washington for Earth Day.   The next time Teresa and Kerry met was at Heinz's funeral. Then, in 1992, the first President Bush chose Teresa as a delegate to the world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro. At a dinner during the summit, John and Teresa ended up deep in conversation about the environment. They spoke to each other in French for part of the night. But it was the next morning that most impressed Teresa, when Kerry, who is also a Catholic, asked to accompany her to Sunday mass. Teresa recalls how he stood in the pew behind her and recited a prayer - in Latin.   "I thought, how many men can do that?" she says.As a handsome single senator (the triple whammy in Washington), the divorced Kerry was linked to an array of women, from television actresses to reporters.   This was not exactly Teresa's style. She recently told the Boston Globe that she didn't have to worry about people looking for skeletons in her closet but couldn't speak for her husband. "I presume there aren't any," she says today. "I don't know, what skeletons? Dead girls?" She laughs.   Teresa says she took it slowly with Kerry, who is five years younger. The biggest obstacle, she says, wasthat they had to integratetwo established, independent, powerful lives - not to mention egos.   They also had to blend two families. Teresa admits that it wasn't the Brady Bunch at first, but she has developed a warm relationship withKerry's daughters, Vanessa(a Harvard medical student) and Alexandra (an independent film-maker who made headlines when sheshowed up at Cannes in a super-sheer dress).   Teresa's own three sons, John IV, Andre and Chris, have blazed very different paths. John, who has given Teresa her first grandchild, lives reclusively as a Buddhist and a blacksmith and runs a school for troubled youths. Andre lives in Europe, where he worked for the environmental group Natural Step. Chris, her terribly handsome youngest child, who once dated Gwyneth Paltrow, has left investment banking to work for the Kerry campaign.   TERESA'S friends maintain that Kerry did all the wooing. "I wouldn't say that," says Teresa, smiling. "We both were intrigued. But how many women did he go out with - and I don't know - who could talk to a parliamentarian from Japan about the global environment? How many women did he know like that? So you become an entity that is more plausible, let's put it that way."   Kerry says, sweetly, that what he fell in love with was "the fullness of a woman". Which is to say that, in addition to being brainy and accomplished, Teresa is "nurturing and incredibly loving, and fun, zany, witty . . ." And sexy? "That's what I meant by the fullness of her womanness," he says. "Definitely sexy. Very earthy, sexy, European. She knows how to speak with her eyes." To visit the Heinz-Kerry homes is to notice not only the shrines to Heinz but also the love notes from Kerry. "To Terezin h a bella, with love and love and love and more love, John," reads one card tucked into the frame of a photo of the two of them looking deliriously happy. (Terezin h a is Portuguese for "Little Teresa".)   The press has taken great delight in itemising the vast fortune Kerry acquired when he said "I do". From the $35m private Gulfstream jet painted ketchup red to the $800,000 boat to the $8,000 bicycle he uses to tool around Nantucket. In a recent article in Newsweek, was noted that the couple's five homes are worth $4.9m (their ski getaway in Ketchum, Idaho), $4.7m (townhouse in Washington), $3.9m (the family farm in Pennsylvania), $9.1m (Nantucket beach house) and $6.9m (Boston residence).   They both insist, however, that Heinz's fortune won't be used to install Kerry in the White House - as evidenced by Kerry's tireless (and successful) fundraising so far - unless, as Teresa puts it, "their honour", his or hers, is attacked. Only then would the Heinz stash be tapped.   STILL, tongues wag. "Every time John Kerry goes to bed with his wife it'sa fundraiser," quipped the conservative columnist Tony Blankley, quoting an anonymous source.   Teresa is ready for the assault. "Oh, that was wonderful what's-his-name," she says. "He could have made the point in a less coarse way. But that doesn't bug me." If people want to cast aspersions, "that's their problem". OK, but does she have a pre-nup? "Everybody has a pre-nup. You have to have a pre-nup. You've got three kids with somebody else, you've got to have a pre-nup." She pauses. "Here, have more. Chicken's not bad for you."   We are lunching in her Georgetown home, in the room where she got the call telling her that Jack had been killed. She has had her staff prepare one of her mother's recipes, a Mozambique curry, and the table is set with precious antique silver. She is wearing her uniform - a Chanel jacket and trousers. On her left hand she's wearing the huge square-cut diamond engagement ring she got from Heinz and the simple gold wedding band she got from Kerry. But Kerry says he doesn't have an issue with the ghost of Heinz. "I've never felt threatened by it. It would be cruel and insensitive if she didn't celebrate his memory. I've told her sons I'm not there to replace anybody, I'm there to be whoever I am."   And the same goes for his wife. Change her? Tame her? "Teresa's gonna be who she is. And I want her to be who she is." Indeed, Teresa may be his secret weapon: she may be mercurial and a little outre at times, but she's authentic. Voters like real, and thatquality might just soften her husband's perceived arrogance. (Teresa insists he is merely "shy".)   The topic turns to Hillary. "I don't think I could have coped so well. I would've been like . . . " She makes a gunshot noise. "I used to say to my husband, my late husband, 'If you ever get something, I'll maim you. Not kill you, just maim you.' And we'd laugh, laugh, laugh."   She says she has never once, in either of her marriages, worried about infidelity. "I have never. Not for one day. Because what I expect of them, they have a right to expect of me. Maybe I'm into 18-year-olds." "That was a joke," Black says.   And with that, Teresa Heinz Kerry is ferried off to her next campaign event.

       Irish Independent Online   SHE HAS been described as outspoken in several languages, and certainly Teresa Heinz Kerry has often left listeners in no doubt as to what she thinks.   Of the Bush administration, she said recently: "I understand why so many of our friends around the world are so mad at us. We've let them down. In a democracy, the one thing that cannot be done is to destroy its trust, its hope, its idealism. This administration is the most cynical, the most venal, the most Machiavellian . . . in my 32 years in Washington."   Nor has her husband escaped the effects of her forthright ways. When Kerry said he didn't suffer nightmares about his service in the Vietnam war, she contradicted him and mimicked him having a flashback: "Down! Down! Down!"   During a recent TV interview, Kerry was asked how he felt about marrying into a fortune. "It's one of the reasons I was cautious," he replied slowly, pausing as if to reckon with the hardship of instant massive wealth. "But then emotions and feelings take precedence and you take what comes with it."   "Gimme a break," Teresa interrupted with a jocular note of warning to her voice. "I came with it. Come on!"   And how will conservative sections of the US press and public react to a woman who has said, "Swearing is a good way to relieve tension"?   One thing is certain - Teresa Heinz Kerry will be the last to worry about it. As she told CNN: "They keep asking, 'Who's your favourite first lady? Who are you going to be like?' I say, 'I'm going to be me'."

       The New York Times Damien Cave   With her Euro-African accent, $500-million fortune, and penchant for free association, Teresa Heinz Kerry is not an easy person to describe. Her fans and foes have called her everything from outspoken and refreshing to churlish, polymorphous and distant.  Now, "organic" can be added to the list.   Chris Heinz, Mrs. Heinz Kerry's youngest son, used the term on Tuesday, while introducing his mother to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Mr. Heinz, who works as a fund-raiser for his stepfather's campaign, buried this compliment in a long line of adjectives.  "My mother in my heart and mind is a force," Mr. Heinz said, "spiritual, organic and loving; smart, funny and wise."   Perhaps he was being cautious because his family's fortune comes from ketchup. But in a political age that hungers for cultural code-words - from NASCAR dads to latte liberals -"organic" may take on a life of its own.   The word clearly connects with an expanding slice of American consumer culture. First used in the 1940's to describe pesticide-free farming, organic is now a marketing tool for everything from soap to nuts. According to the United States Agriculture Department, 73 percent of all grocery stores in the United States now carry organic products. By 2007, some experts estimate, the organic industry will bring in $30.7 billion, roughly equivalent to the revenues last year of Archer Daniels Midland.   The spread of the organic label into areas like Gummi Bears and detergent has helped make the word a form of group identification.  Mark Lipson, a policy director at The Organic Farming Research Foundation, which gives grants to researchers, says that organic is now "shorthand for a lifestyle" that includes support for, say, alternative energy and holistic medicine.   Mark Katz, a humorist and Democratic speechwriter, says that organic may also be a potent political tool.  "Among a certain set, organic is code word for 'She's one of us,' " he says. "People who drink soy milk know what she means."  Does that make Mrs. Heinz Kerry an organic soy latte liberal?   The possibilities for parody seem endless. Republicans have frequently used liberals' consumer choices - Volvos, chardonnay, hot tubs - to suggest that those who claim to fight for middle and lower classes actually fail to share their folksy, down-home values.   For Mrs. Heinz Kerry, who was schooled in Switzerland and inherited her money from her late husband, John Heinz, the issue is particularly sensitive.   She has already has been pinched by Republicans for comparing Senator Kerry to a "fine aged wine." Tagging her "organic" could alienate those who already see her as aloof, says Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review. The word, he says, "still has a very mother-earthy feel."   But Mr. Lowry admits that the term hardly packs as much punch as "holistic" or "new age," or even "latte liberal," which may mean that for now, organic is still a compliment.   "Organic means either free of pesticide or unprocessed, and both of those are very nice things to say about your mom," says the writer Calvin Trillin. "I think free of pesticides is particularly nice."
