       we completely re-did my room. it looks soo pretty. painted the walls a really pretty green color, got a new dark dark purple carpet, new bedding thats green and purple and beige and all these frilly cute pillows. plus a mirror and some paintings for the wall. it looks so cute. and we did it all on a budget of like 200 dollars. oh it looks so friggin cute.       thats pretty much all i've been up to. we destroyed the rest of the house in the process so yesterday it took me almost all day to pick that shit up. oh well it's done now and my room is worth it.      my birthday is 13 days away. i'm going to get a tattoo that should be funnnn and painful.      not much else is up... school starts soon :( back to 4Cs ! and jeff wants to hook me up with his brother steve.  haha WE SHALL SEEEEE

       hey   nothing much going on here lately.  went downtown last night but jeff decided to pull another cinderella and leave at 10pm, so then it was shitty.  THANKS JEFF.  and now--hm  it is shitty out today, i hope it rains and thunders and lightnings.  then i can just sleep all day because the boys are going out with their aunt and uncle.        there's not much else to say... certain someone has been trying to cause some more bullshit drama, but i'm just letting it go because it's so fuckin retarded.      oh, britt moved to michigan to live with her dad.  she said he is excited to have her there and she seems excited too so that's awesome.  shes goin to community college like me haha go britt.      thats all for now.  lata :)

        life is good. school is good. everything is pretty damn good.      all the bullshit drama that seemed like it would never end is finally OVER for good. so now is the time to start over... a new start and the chance to really kick ass and show the people who didn't think i could do it that i really CAN kick ass and be successful.       i am going to be taking real estate classes this fall, to get ready for the real estate licensing test. i never really thought about becoming a real estate agent until recently when i found out about the course. it seems like it would be interesting and it could be something i would be really good at.   just wait everyone, i'm about the become the next fuckin donald trump. hehe. maybe not, but i still think it's a good plan!       i have until the beginning of september off from school so i am going to make the best of the end of the summer. my birthday is on the 29th... yay i'll finally be 18. it seems like so much time has passed but im not even fucking 18 yet. this is the fresh start. i'm excited.   moving out of this house into a house in harwich. saw it today and its gorgeous. so that should be happening right around the end of august / beginning of september.       so it's cool, everythings good. i'm just glad that it's finally time to leave the drama in the past and move on.      so this is my new journal, for a new start. enjoy :)
