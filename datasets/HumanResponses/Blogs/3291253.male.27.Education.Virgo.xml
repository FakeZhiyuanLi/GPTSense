       urlLink Yahoo! News - BUSH YOUTH?   Regardless of what this article says on Kerry and Bush, I found surprising what it says about the "real estate bubble fueled by low interest rates [that] has deprived the vast majority of Americans under 30 of even the hope of buying their first home. "  I also want a home, I also want a life, but it's so hard. My job and my position is hard. I can't do what my father did when he was my age.   So sad.

      My tennis elbow is a bit bad today. You know, I don't play tennis. I just spend my day here sitting in front of the computer. It hurts like hell actually.  Today doesn't feel like its going to be really hot. The weather was hazy but nice, it was fresh but humid. Who the hell cares?  Well, if you live in a place that can become an inferno in less than 2 hours you would. Temperatures around 38C are expected later this week, that means it will probably feel like 45C in this humidity saturated hell hole. To the imperialists, 45C is way too hot.   But it is a bit unfair to call it a hell hole, it can be a beautiful place, with gorgeous mountain framed sunsets and spectacular cloud effects. I enjoy watching the mountain every time I drive home from work. I can get lost in its deep misty ravines and am myself mystified by its white faces of rock around its tops. I wish I could be a cloud, and roll down its green sides, scratching the unscratchable depths of my soul with the tips of its evergreens.   Too bad... I could have been a poet or a thief...  if you know what I mean.   I saw a tv programme (  How I like this girl. I wonder what music she likes.

      Why is it that we don't know what we want? Most of the time we do, but for some moments, especially the most painful, we don't have a clue about what we want.

      Ok.. this is my last blog of the day. I want to get teh hell out of here. The AC in the office is unsufferable. It's so damn cold. Really, I hate sharing my office with tons of people. Well, they are 8 .. but still, it's too much for me. I need my privacy.   My quest today is to find a way to post images in my blogs. Images are so much nicer. I hope I can find a free option of course.    Cheers!

      I think I am a moderate fan of  urlLink Cosmic Baby . I could be much more of a fan if I could actually afford to buy any CDs. But hell, he's one of the great when it comes to electronica. It sure feels a bit wrong when teens nowadays believe that there is nothing greater than Moby or whatever electronica they listen to, if they do at all. I also miss Future Sound of London. They made me so happy, and they still do whenever I get to listen to them. I get so bored of having the same CDs. Sometimes I catch a bit of sample from them in the Discovery Channel, that always makes me smile. But it is also sad that we can't continue to enjoy their sounds, but somehow we can still listen to Madonna and U2 even after 20 years. So lame. Perhaps I should build a list of groups that I would have loved to never let go of ever. Maybe someday.

      I am putting to good use the Blog This button on my google bar.    urlLink Hyperreal  is a site that is reminisent of the first sites I was such a fan of back in 1996 when I " mosaiqued " my way through the internet. We've come so far now with all this. I used to be cool back then. Very first outlaw web page in my university. Now I am one of the drones. Help! Please Help!

      Ok.. here's something useful:  urlLink turux   I don't know who does this site. I don't know what it means. I just know I love it so much. It is to me the first, finest, and only proof of real electronic art. The feeling to me is indescribable. Although of late I have been wandering off the real techno freaking path, I am still a techie. This site helps me jump from thecno to electronica. It's just sublime. I hope someone reads this and agrees with me.

       urlLink gmail swap: checking for invitations   Ok.. what's this about "active" bloggering? I think I failed to read the fine print on this page, or is there? I want my account. Do I have to keep blogging to get one? Well, I will blogg you all to death.   Just so you know, I got an account at blogger.com even before I knew it was a "gateway" to get a gmail accoun.  Not that I will ever get one.  Just my luck.

      Well... cheking this site out :  urlLink www.gmailswap.com  I found out that supposedly if I were an active blogger in this site, I was going to be invited for a gmail account. But to my luck, I wasn't. I then thought that because I was a Mexican and I put that in my profile I wasn't being invited. It's so obnoxiuos when geographical specific content is offerd in sites. My latest outrage was when I wanted to check out the episodes of the not so popular animated series of The Clone Wars that in my country appear on the cartoon network (I'm not bothering to create links for this things, that goes to show you that I am still indignated). Well I connected to the cartoon network site and when I tried to watch the damn cartoos, that I don't even like that much anyway, the browser spewed out somehting like  "This content is not authorized for your region" . How about that? Sucks. Well anyway, I hope that my offer for a free translation of documents in the site will prompt anyone for a gmail swap.   I don't think that's going to happen.

      After reading this subversive piece of journalism  urlLink  "DEMOCRATS FOR GUNS" (Ted Rall)  I began to shiver with rage. What would happen when all you stinking democrats vote for Kerry and put him in office? Yes, I have heard from very trustworthy sources, that as soon as Kerry steps in office (something that we must seek to avoid at all costs), he will completely ban the use, breeding and petting of possums. I mean, what the hell is that? It is since the beginning of this great nation that we have been cultivating the art of breeding and training possums for our own enjoyment and protection. Who will protect my kids from potential, possum wielding strangers? We must fight for this right.

      Hell...  I have never felt comfortable enough with anyone to really tell the first sexual experience I've ever had, so I have a bit of a problem with first times. Some people may even say that I don't give a good first impression, but as they get to know me, in time, they change their minds about me. I find that hard to believe, I think they actually confirm that I am a pompous ass and just realize that I am rather harmless and decide they can actually get by without giving a damn about me.  So without further ado I give you what hopefully will be endless pointless observations on my life and pretty much a complete waste of time.
