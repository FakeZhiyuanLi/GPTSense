      Sorry all for not having updated this in a while.  I know some of you have been eagerly anticipating the every word of my next post.  Especially you over there...yeah, I'm talking to you.  The truth is I haven't been in the greatest of moods lately and for that reason have not felt like writing anything.  Couldn't exactly tell you the reason for my melancholy demeanor as of late...guess I've just been in those ruts that I seem to find myself in every now and again.  Anyway, I thought of the title for todays post while blasting Memphis Bleek this morning on the train.  It describes my situation right now to the tee.  Got my mind right, moneys been right, and with the recent news about Vegas being under terrorist watch only a week before my vacation there, I am now ready for war!  If you think Al Qaida's gonna stop the kid from doing his thing down in Sin City, you are sorely mistaken!  Bring it bitches!!!  That's all for now.

      Let me start off today by saying Happy 23rd Birthday to my good friend Nicole!  I had a good time celebrating with you last night at Jade Terrace.  It was good to get up with people whom I hadn't seen in a long time, VIP was hot, and the bottles were poppin'!  Which leads me to todays thoughts.  If you see me with a drink in my hand, PLEASE TAKE MY CELL PHONE AWAY FROM ME!!!  Its become a terrible habit that when somewhat intoxicated I will call any and everybody for no good reason at all.  I just checked my call log and I called about 50 people last night.  I left my man Rick a voicemail and didn't remember doing it.  And I actually made a date with a female and would've never known about it if I didn't get a call asking what time we were getting up.  Now all of these are miniscule in comparison to the last thing that occured.  Don't you just hate the feeling when you get someone you care for pissed off at you and you know its your fault?  Well apparantly that's what I did last night while drunk.  Didn't even realize I did it until I had what I'd call an extremely unpleasant phone conversation this morning.  I swear if I wasn't such the charming, witty, loveable individual that I am, I'd have a lot more enemies due to my sometimes pedomorphic behavior while drinking.  Anyway, time to focus my thoughts on getting back on this persons good side...I'll holla.    ~FIN~

      Here's a riddle for you...    Question:   WHAT HAS TWO THUMBS AND LOVES GETTING HEAD?           Answer:       THIS GUY!!!     Thought of the Day:   Head is good.  The people that give it, great.  But like anything else, too much of it can cause it to lose its luster!  :-)   Now onto other things...let me start of by saying I appreciate the comments received about yesterdays posting.  Both of you left reasonable arguments, and I can't say any of you are wrong because you are two different people.  To "keep it real", you definitely brought forward some arguments that I hadn't thought of in the past.  It sounds like you have definitely been through, or am currently going through the particular scenario.  If you're letting it be known that you do have those feelings, but just have trouble letting them out, at least you are communicating.  But if you do have feelings, and say and act as if you don't when you really do, that is when a problem arises.  With that said, there is one comment made by "Anonymous" that speaks louder than anything else that was said...        "stuck on stupid" was in reference to the fact that she lets what happened in A, affect her relationship in B. If you weren't over A, then way jump into another scenario, therby hurting someone else in the equation? Wouldn't it have been better to give yourself time by yourself?"   It would be better to heal you wounds before jumping into another battle if you catch my drift.  If I treated every woman I met based on what an ex-girlfriend or two did to me, the new woman and I will never progress.    Now enough of this relationship mumbo-jumbo, lets talk about the fact that I'm going to Vegas in just  15  days!  I don't have time to think about being a one woman man, the SAVAGES are trying to get things poppin' in two weeks.  This will be my first venture to the west coast, and from what people have been telling me, Las Vegas is definitely the place to be.

           Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to present you with two scenario's followed by a simple question at the end, and I'm curious to hear your feedback on the question.      SCENARIO A  Boy meets girl. Girl really likes boy. Boy and girl speak for months and become extremely close to one another. Girl pours out all of her emotions to boy. Boy eventually plays her.   SCENARIO B     Another boy meets same girl. Girl really likes boy. Boy and girl speak for months and become extremely close to one another. Girl (thinking about last boy) decides to conceal her emotions. This boy has genuine feelings for girl, however, girls reluctance to show emotion to boy is misunderstood for disinterest. Boy leaves girl.   Question...is the girl more hurt in Scenario A? Scenario B? Or does each scenario hurt equally???   Over the past few years I have been faced with this reoccuring theme. A woman has been scorn in the past and now she feels she cannot let a new man over that emotional wall that she has since built up. Instead she pushes him away not letting him get the chance to meddle with her inner-most feelings. On the inside she may be filled up with emotion, but on the exterior she continues to hold a cold and indifferent demeanor. At this point, a good man will probably try to take into account the things you have gone through, and attempt to ease you into a more comfortable position. But no matter how much time and effort he is willing to put in, you can't help to think about how much it resembles a situation that has gone bad. And eventually, after this man has been there for you time and time again, one day when you least expect it he is gone...possibly forever.  I guess my point with these two scenarios is that the pain that you feel when a situation goes awry is not because of the emotion you show, it is the simple fact that that emotion exists. The only way to avoid feeling the pain is to not have any feelings at all, and its unhuman for that to happen. The fact of the matter is that life is not easy. You are meant to experience pain, because without it we would not know the true meaning of joy. So the next time that somebody makes you happy, cherish them for all they are worth. The possibilites of what may occur are endless.   ~FIN~
