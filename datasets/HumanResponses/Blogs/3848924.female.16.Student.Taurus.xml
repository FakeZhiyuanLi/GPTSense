      today was my first day to work out in a week. i woke up around 9:00, then got already to go outside and run. i ran three miles thru out the entire day and then had to go mow the grass. so i put on my bathin suit (straight country lol) and hopped on the lawn mower. considering i have 70 acres. and i would be mowin until the sun went down, i put my bathin suit on along with some tannin oil so that i would get some color outside. Today was a pretty normal day, no rat infested motels or no salt and sand..just a regular day. maybe tomorrow will be better...but doubtfully possible!

      Its the day after the "Fourth of July" and im here ALL sunburned and in so much pain..lol. I went to the beach (freeport, to be exact) for the fourth. its was fun. i had a great time. i got to spend it with the friends i love and care bout so very much! so gettin burned was totally worth it. we swam OF COURSE...got completly stared down by perverts that just "happen" to get drunk off their ass. but i dont blame them...bout gettin drunk lol. the popped fireworks and then went to the "motel"...this wasnt just any motel now..Me, my best friend monki, her brother chris and his girlfriend walk in our room, only to fine roaches ALL over the walls!!! it was soo freaky. i was uneasy stayin there, but i had jut got out the ocean and was salty and DESPERATLY needed a shower, so i got my things to take a shower, and then i walk in the bathroom and the shower is nuthin but three plastic walls (that looked like they could be counter tops)and nuthin but a inch thick bottom lap so that the water wouldnt run into the floor. so i just say "okay" then take my shower, get it over with. when i get out the shower, i go to climb into bed and decide that i would prefere clean sheets cause if there are roaches, that prolly means that the sheets arent clean either, right? so i change the sheets, when i go to lift up the matress to tuck the sheet it, the bed frame falls apart! it was so hilarious! after i get everything situated i get in the bed, and lettin you kno i shared the bed with another person..i have a thin sheet over me and i realize that the room is HOTT! i laid under the sheet five minutes and broke a sweat it seemed like. not to mention havin a hot body next to you that puts off heat and me bein up against the wall! the roach infested wall, that has blood smeared on it from smackin masquito's! but spite all that..i ha a great fourth, and this will be an experience that i will never forget as long as i live. everytime i stay at a motel...this will enter my mind. "the famous fourth of '04" lmao...i dont think i would have made it thru that experience if i didnt have my best friends wit me.
