      it's true, I'm actually up and functioning at 8 am.  it's a beautiful, crisp morning too.  the songs of the birds as they gather their young for food is rather comforting right now.  yesterday I couldn't hear them.  yesterday I built up my own little world.  yesterday it seemed as if someone had stolen part of my being, part of my soul.. considering something had accomplished to rip half my heart out while it stood their snickering.  that had to be the case.  what else could have left me feeling so empty?  if I was an alcoholic, I'd have the worst hangover of my life today.  if I were a drug user, I'd be typing this from a hospital bed, and only if I managed to out live the overdose.  yesterday's one of those days that you don't wish on your worst enemy.  it brought out so many different emotions I wasn't sure what one to feel half of the time.  and they're still colliding inside, wondering who will take charge of this remarkable day.  I'm fairly sure that exhaustion will take over.  I'll be left feeling so drained and eventually dispassionate for a while, or so one can hope..  it's strange how I seem so much more in tune with what's taking place around me right now.  I can hear every sound within the silence.  the sky is bluer then I've ever seen it before and not a cloud to block my vision for miles.  it washes over me, trying to cleanse the thoughts of yesterdays from my mind.  the sun's golden arms realize I need comfort as they descend to embrace me with a peculiar warmth only received from above.    with a cup of coffee in hand and a newly lit cigarette, I'm finding today will be tolerable.

      I think I finally got the hang of this, or at least the basics for now.  it really shouldn't be so bad.. and I think I just might enjoy it :)

      I can't get the thing to show up, so it's staying as is for now.  maybe I need to go change all the little settings?  I will check on that really quick before I head out.  this is getting to be a pain!  I hope it's all back to how it should be in the morning.  all newbies have it so bad or am I just really slow at it?  I think it's time not to blog..  oh, and before I forget, congrats to all you Detroit Piston fans!  even though I don't care for basketball, I wish the city of Detroit my best on this evening.  I was going to make some crude remarks about how we've celebrated in this area before, but I think I'll keep them to myself for now.. this damn thing just might actually post lol    take care!

      I'm thinking this might not be such a great idea.  the damn thing is causing me more grief then what it's worth lol  I want it pink, damn it.. with my posts in it, not some randomly generated ones!  is that too much to ask for?  hehehe    actually, I had to start a new blog thing cause I couldn't get into my other one (and it was new too).  what a pain!  well, I finally did get into the other one.  piece of advice for the newbie bloggers, never hit that anaccountplease thing in the settings area.  it changes your damn user name to anaccountplease!  after they got the password thing working, I realized it wasn't my password that was messed up at all, it was the user name.    I did get into it, finally and really messed the second one all up by changing the name of the webpage lol eventually I just said to hell with the other one and took that info from it and brought it into this one, the first post.    now if I could only get that post to show up (and not three damn times I hope), and turn my page the pretty pink rose color..

      well, well.. here I finally am.  actually, I never thought I'd be able to post one of these blogs.  every time I tried to log in, I kept getting a message.  after changing some info and getting a new account (and yes, I still want my other one, damn it), I finally get to post.  I'm not touching a single thing in the settings till they get this fixed.  I hope to hell that's soon tho, cause I want to play with it!  I love messing with stuff for the first time, seeing how each thing works.. but to be honest, I won't be testing out all the chit in here for a long time and only cause I don't know enough to do so.  but I'll learn, sooner or later!  and hush to those that think you know me and figure it will definitely be later..  "smack"  after messing around on the internet late last night, I came across a few postings by "bloggers" and started reading.  some were pretty interesting while others left a bit (ok, a hell of a lot) to be desired.  what it all seemed to boil down to tho, was basically typing to one's self.  I figured that would be a piece of cake!  if anyone can sit for hours on end, typing about nothing, that would be me.  also, I thought it would give me the chance to get back some of my writing skills.  if this could make me write in complete thoughts/sentences, then it's well worth the time.  let's see how far that goes lol one thing's for certain, it seems a bit strange putting things in print that someone might actually read.  I'll decide later if I want to really put some thought into this, or just use it as a sounding board.  we shall see..   take care!
