        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIFE IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER!!!!!!!!       &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It has been a few days since I last wrote in my blog. Things are better today than the other day. Brent finally talked to me yesterday and we made up. Spent all day today together and no fighting. With all the stress the two of us are each under ( some things are the same for the two of us and some are different) it really takes a toll on our marriage. But I love him unconditionally and I know that he loves me as well. I will do everytihing in my power to make everythin better for the two of us. He is the best thing that has happened to me and I am not going to lose him with out a fight.         &nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp; Madison was pretty good the last few days I guess except for tonight when we told her to pick up the bag of chips that she had dumped all over the floor she wouldnt do it. She sometimes acts as though she cant hear us when we are talking to her and it pisses both Brent and I off to no end. We have to spank her every once in a while and I dont mean beat but a light crack on the butt so that she knows what she is doing is wrong. We feel bad after doing it but what else are we to do. U know.&nbsp; Tonight Brent took us out to eat at the bowling alley in Charles City. Damn that tasted so good for a change.&nbsp; Not much else to type tonight.        &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Patti Rae       &nbsp;

             I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO ANYMORE!!!!!!!! MY LIFE SEEMS TO BE IN RUIONS!!!!!!     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;         Well he said that he is leaving me!!!! I cant let him go he is my world along with mattie. Last night i was tryin to help out a girl friend and get her in a better relationship but she wanted me to see how far the&nbsp;guy could be trusted. So she asked if i would test him. He is a nice guy and everythin but eventually he started havein cyber sex.&nbsp; So I played a long in words only wasnt doin anythin physically. Well my computer logged off cause remote computer problems with iowa telecom. I couldnt get back on here last night. So this morning when Brent got home from work he tried like 5 times to connect and then it finally connected. Well when he did my messanger came up. I guess he was talkin to one of the guys at work and they told him about the message archives. So he found the convo that i had. Cause i couldnt get back on last night to delete it.&nbsp;He says that he is leaving and he has nothin to say to me. When tryin to explaine everythin to him i told him that he is the only one i want and have wanted since we got together. He said that isnt what it seems and that I can go fuck myself and move in with that guy. Hopes i am happy with him.&nbsp; I dont want anyone but Brent. I cant imagine my life with out him in it. He left here at like 1:00 this afternoon to go to work which he didnt have to be there til like 5 but said he was goin to try to go get his hair cut first. Come on it doesnt take an extra 2 hrs to get ur hair cut. I begged him not to go to sit and talk to me and he said when he was leavin that he would be home in the morning. Man I hope that is a good thing. Maybe he will be cooled down enough to talk to me and let me explaine everythin to him,I dont want    him to leave me. That is the last thing that I would ever want. If he did or does leave i know that it   will kill me if he does and hurt mattie too. He wasnt what i had in mind of "Mr, Right" growing up, But now that image has changed of what "Mr. RIght" was to what "Mr. Right actually is. That changed the day him and&nbsp; I met. Brent is what i actually have always wanted and more. He completes me 100%. I know I bitch alot about some shit he does but everyone bitches about things their soul mate does. I know he bitches about what I do, but i know he loves me and he hope he knows i love him with all my heart and soul.&nbsp; So I dont know what to do anymore. I cant live with out him though I know that much. BRENT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I WANT AND EVER WILL WANT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. U HOLD MY HEART IN THE PSALM OF U R HAND. Think about that before u do anythin u will regret and the fact that we have been through so much shit and have made it ths far. As far as u signin up on that site  imatchup.com why?   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Patti Rae

         Patti Rae &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;         Today started out pretty good I guess u could say. My mother in law came up and spent time with my husband and our daughter. That made Madison's day gettin to see her grandma. I got to talk to Jannel today on here through messanger. She sent me some pics of the girls. They are getin so big. I miss them all so much. I so wish they would come back, but I know that will never happen. Can always dream though cant I! She is so stressed out with Tim right now and I cant blame her. He from what I hear resembles Jacob in a way. Not good at all. She also told me that omg Cindy Tieskotter has a boyfriend and he is not much older than her. That is always a good thing, dateing someone like ur parents age is WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Madison has watched her Charlette's Web 2 and right now is watchin the Lion King. She never wants to go to bed!!!! LOL! No she is not the splittin image of me . Ok maybe she is. Then she will grow up to be a Redneck Woman just like her mommy. I have a lot more to say but need to get answers first before blowing up about this. FYI about Brent and think he is looking for another woman on here. But I found a girl that he was talkin to So I will either type back tonight or tomerrow on what is goin on in my head and in my life.&nbsp;        &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;    Patti Rae      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       I'm back!!!!! Better run. Today was a better day than yesterday. Brent and I dont seem to be fighting anymore. Which is great news. I love him so much and our daughter does as well. I dont know what I would do with out him here with us. He really does complete me. He bought me a&nbsp; new cd today with the song Redneck Woman. I love that song. We went looking for a new van for me today in Waterloo. Found a couple I like however dunno about prices. So who knows when I will get a new van. Not me!!! LOL. Madison has been really good today. She is gettin to be so big. I want to just shrink wrap her so she cant grow anymore. I want to keep her little, however that isnt going to work. She is so smart for a 2 yr old. I was told last week that she talks like a 5 yr old. Time has gone by so fast.&nbsp; Today my leg hasnt hurt a hell of a lot that too is a good thing. I have had a lot of things going through my head today everytime I turned around I heard Finger Eleven's song "One Thing" . That brought in to mind Peterson. I miss her so much. She was one of the greatest people I ever met. She had a awsome personality. Easy to get a long with. And willing to listen to me when haveing problems. I better stop cause i am gonna start cryin and I know Sargent will if she reads this. So if u do read this Christie--- Think of Kellogg, Jeff, and probly Beve. That will give u somethin to laugh at. What u have been told about the first two and what everyone would imagine how the third one is. You would know though. U love him honey. Dont deny it!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mr and Mrs Beve!!!! LOL. I suppose that I should go for tonight and spent time with Mattie and Brent.

       A little fore warning I am very scatter brained. My mind just jumps from on thing to another in no time. So here I go. My whole life seems like it is fucked up. I mean i get into a fight with my husband and he&nbsp; says that he's leaving. Then he doesnt know if he is or not. My family says that i can forget about them and everythin over there&nbsp;and&nbsp;i love my husband .My left femer was broke in three spots and they inserted a rod in my leg. and put three pins in it. Now two of the screws are bent and one of the breaks hasnt even started healing. Since that day my life has been so turned upside down it isnt even funny. Nothin i do makes anyone happy. I sometimes feel that things would be better if i had died in that accident. I know that is not right for me to say but is true. I feel like a burdon on everyone and cant take it anymore. To me the only one that would have affected i mean really affected is my two yr old daughter Madison. I love he so much. She is everything to me. I just cant stand things anymore cause everytime i turn around im fighting with someone else. If it isnt my husband ( who I love so much), it's my parents, and if not them it is my brothers.I am at my witts ends here. Like i said before not mattter what i do i cant please anyone. This accident has put such a strain on my marriage. We had only been married a few days shy of 3&nbsp; months when it happened. I suppose I better go check on Madison.
