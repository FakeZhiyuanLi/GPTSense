      Well, it's officially Memorial Day and we have made it in early at 1AM. That's a good thing though b/c this $^&@ was begining to wear me out. Last week my job sent my check to Atlanta and I had to wing the weekend w/ limited funds. Thankfully, we went to kick it w/ some people from MS and were well taken care of. As a matter of fact they sent us home w/ enough BBQ to last a week.   As of this moment, I am still LIT and hopefully won't make many mistakes. But if so, whateva, cause I ain't spellcheckin tonight. Talked to my sister today. She is really growing up fast. I know it's gonna be trouble in the future b/c she is turning out to be a real cutie. But, she got it honestly. She's my lil' world right now though. I'm glad all my lectures are finally sinking in.   Tonight we went to anothet house set and I was talking to some Delta's from back home. One of them was the cousin of my ex. She is really an aiight person. Brought back some crazy memories, but not enough to make me miss that crazy shit we used to go through.   My new "interest" is arriving on Tuesday and I must admit that I'm looking forward to her arrival. J-Dot and Frat are cool to chill w/, but they definitely ain't her. Plus, to be honest, I'm gettin tired of kickin it. Shit takes too much energy. I'd rather catch a movie or do a picnic anyday. Damn, I gotta find out what the hell has me talking like this. She had to have put roots on me! If so, it's some good ass roots!  Found some of my high school classmates and associates on the MS Sexual Offender website. Seems they were pulling an R Kelly and happened to get caught. God , please no daughters for me. If so, I'm going to jail. I can see that shit a mile away.   Life can be so tricky sometimes. U can have everything and still feel that something is missing. I have a lot to be thankful for, but still feel some type of void. Wonder why. Should be happier, but am in limbo right now. I keep having these crazy ass dreams about Mama. All of them relate to the hospital or her death bed. Damn I miss her so much. Outta all the people in the world, I had to lose the person that meant the most. Think that's the void I referred to earlier. I think about it all too much. Sometimes it hits home so hard that all I can say is "damn."  The room is spinnin a bit, so I gotta bring this one to a close. All in all, life is still treating me well. Just gotta remember that the only thing constant in this world is change. So, I welcome the challenges to come!

      Well, the last post was all about organizing, doing right, and a myriad of other things that appeared to make me a Do Right Man. However, we have started the weekend up and it's only gettin betta! Last night was crazy as hell. We went to this chick's house and we were already DONE before we entered the door. Talk about crunk! Then, they had mo' Vodka to make the situation a whole lot worse. It was cool though. Just hope my luck doesn't run out. I've heard a lotta stories about DUIs. I try not to get behind the wheel after drinkin, but I've been on a roll for the last couple of weeks.   WHY am I being tested? Just when I was so thankful for meeting Miss Right, God goes and throws a curveball at me. This girl stopped by the social and definitely had my #1 fettish...a GHETTO BOOTY! And I do mean GHETTO! Then to complicate matters even more, her roommate has made an offer to "hook me up." I didn't make any advances, or even ask one question about her. So, in all actuality, it ain't my fault this time. But, all in all it really doesn't matter. I ain't gonna act on it. What I've built over the last few months is much more valuable to me and I wouldn't compromise it for anything. Damn, is this really me talkin?  Well, I must admit that some people are just the epitome of ignorance. Sorry, for saying it like this, but REAL NIGGAS! The guard in my building always greets the whites with such enthusiasm and gives the blacks a brief hello. Why in the hell are we still dancing a jig for whites in the year 2004? I'm to the point now that I don't even want to speak to his ass. I give a brief "alright now" and just decided to keep it moving.   I've come to the conclusion that people have many sides...myself included. Even here on my posts, I notice a vast difference...and there are only three. I'm thankful for the ability to be diverse though. I've yet to go into a bad neighborhood and feel intimidated. Hell, I've seen them all my life. I just trip when my classmates talk about SW DC. I'm like "this is what you call bad?" Also, we were talking about how the women up here are so different than those from the south. Women from home are just so down to Earth. Even last night this one girl went on and on using 10-letter words every 15 seconds. I was thinking to myself "please shut the $%&# up!" It's been like that w/ nearly every social setting we've been in. And it ain't just cause we're law students. Then again...that might be the answer. Most of the socials have been by, for, and all about law students, w/ a bighead PhD. student here and there. I just know that if this one fails to work out(which I can't imagine), I'mma start dating teachers, dentists, whateva. Just no more lawyers, my last 4 have been exactly that.   In conclusion, we've got big plans for the whole holiday. I'm making my first drink as soon as this post is done. Imma just do right Mon-Thurs and the rest of the week will be "whateva comes to mind." Still way to happy to be real right now. Sumn's gonna happen to ruin it. I can feel it. So, am I going to kick it hard this weekend? As Dave Chapelle would say WHAT????? YEAH!!!!!!!!

      Well, wouldn't you know it? Only made it into day two before I began to slack. I'm really starting to think that this may not be an everyday thing. But, Imma try my best. Overall, today was a good day. I did however feel the drastic kicback of having drinks on a Tuesday night. I've got this one frat who's a bad influence when it comes to kickin' it. I think he's got it down to a science. As for me, just can't seem to manage socializing and going to work. It pretty much has to be either/OR. So, that ain't really a hard decision. Thus, I'm sitting in the apartment right now and enjoying every bit of it. Which brings me to paragraph two.  I've decided to organize my life a bit more. I'm a planner to the heart. Quite frankly, I've got my life planned out over the next 2 years. But as for the time being I have decided to better my diet(tonight I'm grrilling chicken and making linguini w/ Alfredo sauce) and work out daily. This will more than likely exclude weekends, but 5 outta 7 days ain't bad. I've set a goal of a firm 185 by this summer's end. That shouldn't be too difficult since I'm at about 175 now. As I was returning from my lunchbreak today I started thinking about Atlanta and how I am 100% sure I'll be spending the rest of my days there. I wouldn't live in DC if my name was LIVE IN DC. I like the excitement, but when I start thinking about raising a family, the cost of real estate, and proximity to family, it's relatively simple. I'm looking forward to those days. Lord knows I'm disgusted with living off of financial aid.  As for random thoughts...1).why in the hell do I like "Soul Food" the series so damn much. I've never followed a TV show, per se. But, damn that show is on point. It's full of drama and I guess the fact that it's got black folks in it is a major plus. Lord knows I get tired of flipping channels and never seeing anyone who looks like me. 2)Found out that the little girl from "Family Matters" turned into a porn star. That's horrible, but I know Imma try to see for myself. Curiosity! 3)My ex dissed my law school and said she was glad she didn't go there(after she had been rejected twice). This was a kick in the face considering it's my law school. Said it was unaccredited. Howard Law...as long as it's been around. Whew! Thank God for opening my eyes after being closed for over 5 years. 4) Lastly, I've learned thatr I despise 5 star restaurants. They're uncomfortable. U monitor your every move. And the food is always nasty as hell. I went to one last week and the whole time was sitting there wishing I was at Olive Garden or sumn'. Don't care how many cases I ever win, I'm not going to change. Give me a full meal w/ "regular" lettuce leaves. Not "real" leaves. Hell, felt like I was eating the shrubbery from the back yard. I was appreciative though. My boss is extremely caring. I try to go all out for her. She's helped me a lot.  In short...organizing, relaxing, and remaining optimistic!

      Well, finally took out the time to do what I have been promising myself I would do for years. I've always wanted to chronicle my life, but was just too damn lazy to do so. Then, my roommate told me about this BLOG site, so here I am...pulling a Doogie Howser!  Man, so much has changed in the last few months. I am nearing the end of law school and have a new job that provides a substantial amount of legal experience. I am begining to develop a really close relationship with my lil' sister. I think Mama's passing contributed to that a lot. I knew that it was going to kick in eventually. Today as I was leaving Howard, I actually thought about calling her. Crazy huh? It is just so strange not having her a phone call away. But, I don't complain and hardly ever discuss it w/ anyone but my sister. Only she knows how I truly feel.   I worry about her sometimes. It just seems like every damn lil' idiot that expresses some interest in her is a damn fool! Not that I'm overprotective, but "what's up joo" ain't exactly how they should address me when meeting for the 1st time. Wheeew, I pray I only have sons. I do feel that Mama is pretty satisfied w/ the way things have been going in my life though. All the way from Lanier High to Howard Law. Hell, one day Imma write a book!  As for personal life issues, I have met a wonderful person and for the first time EVER can truly say that I have been faithful. Crazy I know! But, at 27 it's probably time to start akkin' right. Lord knows, it takes a hell of a lot of time and energy to have more than 1 serious "emotional interest." Plus, I sleep better just knowing that I don't have to do crazy things anymore like hide my caller ID or the all too famous cell phone on "silent" trick. Boy, I must have been a damn fool! I thought I had it going on back in the days of Gorgeous Rho! But, u live and u learn. So, I'm more of a man now and Lord knows I don't plan to be married more than once. So, whenever I do jump that broom, my wife will have a GOOD MAN. A lil' arrogant, but hey I am in a field that beckons this attitude.   In summary, started a BLOG, missing Mama, loving lil' sis, enjoying my new job, adoring my new ride, kickin' it w/ new roommate, high level of like re: new personal interest, returning to HU Law. On about an 8 right now on a "lovin life" scale of 1-10. God has truly blessed a brotha'!!!!!!

      It's been a minute since I've decided to post a new entry. My last post was filled with fury and disappointment. I blasted off so much that I haven't posted since. It was ignorant and one that I am not proud of. So, I removed it! I thought about never accessing this page again b/c I find myself holding back a bit. Too many people have access to it, which in turn forces me to write for them, even when it's unintentional. Some things I just can't say!  So much has happened that it's impossible to track it all. The most shocking occurrence was one that ended w/ me being denied new housing. My old roommate decided to move out in the middle of the lease for absolutely no reason(other than he liked another apt.) and that resulted in us being hit w/ a 3 month penalty in addition to atty. fees. I'm talking a whopping $5500. So, as I'm looking for a new place, this issue raises its ugly head and I'm denied. It doesn't matter that I had lived there for 2 1/2 yrs. and was not once late. Nor does it matter that my old place of residency is willing to explain. Denied is denied and now I'll have to fix it. Damn, I hope we never meet in public!  I talked to my ex today after quite some time. I felt bad for her b/c she lost her mother right before I lost mine and explained that she cries a lot. She has been on CNN and in all the local papers b/c a physician refused to treat her after a cooking accident b/c her father is against tort reform and the physician's wife has been lobbying for it. Initially, I thought it was a lawsuit packaged and ready to be printed out, but come to find out, it's legal. He issued a referral, which qualifies as assistance. It's not exactly mandatory that he does the treatment himself.   I hope all women realize that there is one thing a man hates to hear. Men always sit around talking about wondering when women go to the bathroom. It's just something we never see you all doing. I'm sure we know the answer once a marriage comes into play. But, in relationships, men never want to hear about it or imagine it...period. I can deal w/ "period" talk and even a quick "pee" story. But, anything in re: to #2 and I'm like "damn." Everyone has to go. That's just a normal bodily function. But, until I'm about 5 yrs into a marriage, I'd prefer to be left in the dark on this one!  Random thoughtz:  Why in the hell do squirrels have "huge" balls? I saw a squirrel in the park on my way to work and his balls were about 1/3 the size of his head. They were damn near dragging on the ground. Then again, maybe he was an exception. He was probably just God's gift to the lil' squirrel chicks in his tree!  Will I ever get used to the racial disparities throughout every single facet of life? The majority of the attys in my office are white. But the suppor staff is black. Guess who does most of the work? The construction work going on next door is full of blacks and Mexicans, but the supervisors standing on the hill are ALL white. Guess who's digging, plowing, and doing all the dump truck driving? The subway workers are mainly minorities, but as I passed the main office last week I saw a white guy sitting on his azz surrounded by...you guessed it, US as he proceeded to give out instructions. I could go on but my page would probably run out.   Overall, things are pretty good. I still miss Mama every day. Damn, there's so much to ask. She reminded me of Balki on "Perfect Strangers" in that she had the craziest ideas sometimes but was ALWAYS right. I'm so damn sure I'll never run across that ever again in life.   I have this feeling that I've created a subpar post today. I usually pride myself on my writing and trying to get a little creative, but the inspiration is not here today. My lil' sister should be up in the coming weeks. I gotta show her there's more than Jackson, MS out there. My relationship is good as always. Wonder where inspiration comes from? I had a good day today. Why am I not in a better "writing mood" then?

      I might be on to something...this is mt 2nd post in 2 days. That everyday shit just seems impossible. Things just come up in life a I simply can't do it. I commend those who do though. Well, I was brainstorming during my walk past the nation's capitol this afternoon. I looked around and really wondered when "we" are going to make progress. The majority of the homeless are black. The majority of the politicians are white. This trickles right on down to the damn interns. I just attribute it to our trip across the Atlantic almost 500 years ago. That will have everlasting effects.   I know it sounds crazy, but I'm sure my family will have a black physician, dentist, accountant(if for some reason I can't count my own $), and insurer. I just believe in supporting my people. A black person will go to a white dentist much faster than a white to one of us. I'm not being racist...just honest. I know someone who is seriously contemplating what med school to attend and many(mostly us) have been telling her that Howard and Meharry are sub-par. I'm speaking 1st hand when I say that Howard Law produces some of the finest lawyers this world has seen. ((Thurgood Marshall & Vernon Jordan to name a couple). The "you need our schools" attitude drives me through the roof. But, that's life and I've grown to expect some things.   I often wonder about satisfaction. What truly makes one happy? Am I nearing this stage? I like my job, but am I satisfied with it? I like my life, but could there be more? Must one eventually just say, "hey this is as good as it's gonna get for me!" The only thing I'm sure about is family. I just think back to the most difficult portion of my life, which ironically was about 6 months ago. When I lost my mother, friends were few and far between. I even took special notice of those that attended the funeral. The common denominator through this turmoil was my family and "Miss Special." I've defined happiness in my mind and it's not unattainable. Family--- that's it. As long as I'm able to provide for them, vacation every now and again, and keep a smile on my wife's face, I'm good. Damn, I'm really getting afraid of this new guy I've become. What if I have lost my nupish ways for good? If I was in college now, I'd probably be recruited by the damn Sigma's! Well nah, still gotta consider my looks.   Overall life is still good and appears to be getting better by the day. As for random thoughts:  -What makes someone say "hey, a bomb threat to The Hill during Reagan's Memorial is a good idea today!" (it happened) -How do people 2nd guess God when the heart beats w/ no effort, we breathe in our sleep w/o knowing, procreation takes little effort and is highly desirable, not one person yet has died and returned to tell a "truthful" story. I liken it to a 6 month old child in front of a computer. Just b/c he doesn't understand the internet, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It just means his mind isn't capable of comprehending what is actually taking place. That's my take on the afterlife!  -LN

      Again, I have neglected to be consistent. I'm not too sure how many days have passed me by, but this ain't a marriage, so I'll post when I please. Well, I've broken all the rules. I'm having drinks on Tuesday(which by the way were good as hell), didn't lift a single dumbbell, and am about to get deep into this Finals game in the next few moments.   Ronald Reagan died and the city is pretty locked down on Friday. But, my lucky azz has to report to work anyway. It's cool though. Although all my people are off. As far as updates, I didn't get around to calling my brother, but will try to meet w/ him this weekend. This is really close to being some Oprah Winfrey shit. But, then again...isn't life that way?  I cooked for a woman for the 1st time in my life last night. She said she loved it and the fact that the plate was "clean" coated a brotha's ego 100%. The truth of the matter is, I'm feeling her more than anyone I have ever been with. We connect on an intellectual level, as well as others. She's spiritual, but not a "Bible bugger." She's more than cute, so I gotta call it sexy. Sometimes I feel that she may be as intelligent as me.  Hell, maybe even a bit more. I think the ultimate turn on is a woman who has hips and brains(not necessarily in that order). I just don't wanna end up w/ someone who makes me think, "Damn that's a difficult question. But, I know if I don't know, then she sure as hell doesn't!" So, it's working out fine. Either I have found "Miss Special" or I'm just aging way too fast at 27.   Random thoughts: -Why the hell did T.I. violate probation just to end up right back where he started? -Is there some type of covenant against pre-8AM construction, cause I'm about to go postal if I don't get more sleep in the morning.  -Why do Big Butts look so good when it's probably the funkiest part of a woman's body? -Why did Condeleeza Rice make the comment that the civil rights movement was unnecessary? -Why R no blacks in the Senate? -Why are airplanes always 95% white? -Why are buses always 95% black? -Why is HIV the number one killer of Af. Am. in my age group, but I don't know anyone who has died from it who's 18-35?  -LN

      Well, I've been away for quite awhile now, but have some downtime since it's the weekend. It's drizzling outside and the temperature is in the lower 60's. As I look out my 8th floor window, I can truly appreciate a rainy afternoon. Lately, life has been moving a bit quickly. So, I welcome a little calm every now and then.   I'm not sure why I love days like this, but they're alright. I guess it goes back to me liking things that others tend to dislike. Don't know why but I am partial to the simple things. I rarely ever wear clothes w/ stripes or checks(never), can watch Forensic Files for hours, and actually love a lil' poetry here and there. I should write again. I actually got a standing ovation for my last piece. Anyway, as I've said before people always have two sides. The other "me" loves to do happy hour, freestye, and act a damn fool. Guess it's normal to get a little crazy sometimes. It provides for a healthy balance.   I've been thinking about meeting the 1/2 brother that I never got the opportunity to meet before. It's cool though. He's 4 years older than me, which means Dad wasn't cheatin', so I'm all good with that. He lives in the DC area and is an airplane pilot. I was blown by this. It ain't exactly a lot of brothas who R doing that. Wonder if he looks like Dad, me, or my sister? Guess time will reveal.   Been thinking about the law and what I plan to do in the coming months. I'm not 100% sure about anything. I know I plan to be successful, but I'm not dying for a few $$$. A lot of attys leave here from heart attacks at a young age. It just happened to a successful lawyer back home. Another had a quad-bypass and he's only about 39. That worries me. I want to be able to provide for my family and be happy at the same time.   I was once told, you sleep 8 hours, work 8 hours, and the other 8 belong to you. So, if you're going to be working for 1/3 of your life, be sure to do something that you enjoy. Otherwise it's not worth it. Brilliant thought...yet somewhat fictional. The lady working the window at Popeye's might not be extremely happy with her position, but being happy on the job is minute when you've got to put food on the table. Don't know where I was going with that, but I plan to enjoy my job. Lord knows I've paid the price to at least have an oak desk and good ass retirement plan!  In closing, the kicking it thing has slowed a bit. I might not be built for it in the long run. I actually ended up losing 2 lbs in the process and got off track a bit. I'm saying it now...that shit ain't worth it. I'm too "laid back" for that. Have I been fakin' over the past few weeks. Pretending to have fun? Did those days pass me by in my early 20's? Anyway, I'm gettin' back this week and will resume cooking, working out and sticking to the plan. Focus, cause these damn distractions....

      Every now and then I get a little inspired by certain occurrences in life. Whether it's positive inspiration or negative. I woke up this AM to a phone call from my cousin. Now this is my road dawg. We go back to the days when I was 2 and he was 0. Well, he's been arguing/fighting/tire slashing/email checking/camera settin' up/ with his wife for the last 6 months or so. I told him this AM that I found it odd that the last 30-40 times we've spoken, they've been having REAL problems. I could write a book on all that has taken place! And it ain't even my marriage. This brought me to the question of when do you know when it's time to REALLY let go.   I'm not one for true BULLSHIT when it comes to relationships. But, ironically I've never had to deal with much drama in my time. I've had my share of disagreements, but never had anything involving police or even a complaining neighbor for that matter. To this day I can still have a productive conversation w/ all of my ex's(not that I exercise that option much).   Some things are just NOT rocket science. If you have 2 people trying to prove two conflicting points of view, NO ONE is going to win that debate. Thus, before I dedicate 1-2 hours of my life to arguing, I'll just walk away. I do not argue...period! Leaving allows both parties to cool off and eventually come back to have a peaceful discussion(in most cases).   Now there were times when things got pretty hectic and I had no way of avoiding the loud noises. I remember during my days of "Kappa Konfusion" I actually had 2 real girlfriends on my small HBCU campus. Both were quite popular, which led me to believe that they actually knew about one another and just let me get away w/ that stupid $#i% for whatever reason. Anyway, we'll refer to them as #1 and #2. Well, I was on my way to pick out a tux for the AKA ball(further revealing that I thought they knew, if I was willing to be out in public). We stopped to check on my car since it had stopped on the highway the night before. Well, as #2 and I pulled up, #1 also pulls up too nicely stating "I just came out to check on your car for you"(so thoughtful, right?). Well, a dispute instantly takes place and my BRILLIANT ass decides that we should drive to a nearby parking lot and talk things out. We arrive and to my surprise they are not even trippin too hard on me. Then, one threatened to leave if I didn't pull off w/ her at that very moment. So, I just walked back to campus with a lot to think about.   This is where it gets funny. I called them both about 3 hours later and got no answer. So, my best friend and I decide to go back to  the parking lot. NOOOOO. They CANNOT still be here for over 4 hours. Yep, and when I got out the car it was ON! They went OFF. "We know this. We know that!" They knew  everything . It was like they instantly became best friends!!!! I really did not realize I was doing the same things in both relationships until that very moment. I was like "what the hell was I thinking?" So, to bring this one to a close...I ended up having to "pick one." We stayed together for 3 more years, but I really do think I should have just started from scratch. And yes...I still have decent relationships with them as well. Didn't quite make it to the AKA ball that year though(smile)!  Anyway, I have decided to write about whatever I choose. I was a little reluctant b/c so many people have this address. But, the people that are a significant part of my life understand where I am at this point in my life. And if anyone decides to form a negative opinion...that's kool too. I feel that this blog will be more interesting if I post what I want to post.  I'm an upstanding person of good moral character. However, this does not mean that I haven't been through a million and a 1/2 episodes of "Real World Shit." To those readers that appreciate my entries, look forward to a spicier version. So, yes...this is the rebirth of Lawnupe!  Random thoughtz:  If humans had the ability to know our date of expiration, would we really want to know?  Am I too old(27) to get a Kappa diamond tattooed on my arm?   When the human body automatically reproduces blood that is lost, scabs over any skin that is broken, and maintains a constant temperature of 98.6, how can some still doubt God's existence. It's almost like being born w/ a pre-installed self-repair kit!  What type of law am I going to practice and how many of my dreams will somehow fall short?  Am I gifted in some type of unique way or am I just a hard worker?  -LN

      As I sit back and look at the gray sky, which is almost a powder blue at this moment, I am able to exhale from a long days work. Every now and then I think about how fortunate I am at this point in my life and it really makes me appreciate the opportunities that I've been given. I'm content w/ my lifestyle right now and I suppose...this is my intro!  Last Sunday I went to a church that "pissed me off (hope He understandz)." I was optomistic about the service and really started that Sunday off in a good mood. The first 15 minutes were okay. Then it happened! They crunk up the damn organ and kicked off the damn concert. Lil kidz shaking, big kidz shaking, young, old, cripple...it was mandatory that you MOVE SUMN'. And if that wasn't enough, every other 5 mins. was "shake handz time." So, I'm shaking hands, standing up, sitting down, hugging(I'm serious), and the whole nine. I'm not one to do thingz just because everyone else is doing it, not even in the house of the Lord. So, eventually I said the hell w/ it. I sat down and just listened. I'm not knocking it, but it just wasn't for me. I'm used to a more conservative environment at church. This was more like Ty-Bo! So, needless to say, I'm trying someplace else.   My roommate went home for the weekend so I decided to spice things up a bit last night. I cooked pasta w/ garlic bread and even went all out w/ candles and a little bit of Jazz. It got me mad points...I could tell. Makes me wonder if I shoulda tried this good guy thing long ago. It was relaxing to be able to spend some time together as the night winded down.   I wonder what age men start to lose their sexual drive. I have heard that 25-30 are supposed to be our best years. But, I'd be lying if I said I haven't fallen asleep a couple of times lately. What the hell is wrong with me? Then again, that makes it all the "mo bettah." Nothing like waiting for about a week and then letting it all go! Just makes you think, "God made this for Me!" Something about that seems blasphemous!   The world is strange sometimes. You can have up moments and down ones as well. I'm at the point in my life now where I want to define happiness and have been trying new things. A well rounded relationship, exercise, family communication, etc. For some reason though, all the bad shit is just so exciting! I wanna balance this thing well, but at times I just get in the mood to say "man, whateva." Life isn't fair, but you've gotta take the cards you're dealt. I have real life childhood friends that became crackheads. I'm only 27. None of my guys I grew up with are doing a whole lot right now. I just sit back and think...I too shot basketball, stole plums from Mr. Anderson's backyard, slipped an extra Airhead in at the candylady's house, but for some reason things turned out differently for me. I've always wondered why this law school thing couldn't have included more of us. The other guys were just as smart!   Random thoughtz:  -Does saying "Rick James, Bitch" at the BET awards make Rick James feel he's on top again?  -Why am I suddenly stuck on this "thick" fettish? Don't notice anything below 145 lbs. (I'm trippin).  -What the hell happened to Tevin Campbell. Wasn't he supposed to be the next Mike Jxn?   What would Tupac be doing if he was still alive? If we would have lost Malcolm X at the age of 25, we would have only lost a streetwise pimp named Detroit Redd!(Something to consider).  -Do most black w/ $ sub-consciously look down on those w/ less $. I've heard some awful conversations at school and everyone seems to be afraid of Southeast DC.   -What if makind is far less important that we think and at this life's end the lights simply go out...forever?   -LN
