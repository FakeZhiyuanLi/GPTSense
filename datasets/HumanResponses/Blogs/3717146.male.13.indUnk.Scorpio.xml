       I'm so glad its here. It felt great to sleep in this morning. Well, today should be an easy-going day. Just gonna go to EB Games and buy a game, not sure which one yet.. Then, I'll either invite my friends over or go over one of their houses and spend the day playing videogames, watching movies, bikeriding or something else. Well, nothing much to talk bout.

       Well, today was the last day of school for me, and I'm not happy. Why? Well many things. Today was not a good day for anybody. Since a lot of people are moivng or going to other high schools, everybody was kinda upset. But, we made the best of the situation and just had fun with our friends one last time. The other reason why I'm upset is because my best friend and I are pissed off at each other. We both got in trounle in math and somehow he got all the blame and was pissed that I got him in even more trouble by knocking over this thing we were working on and he had to pick it all up and re-assemble it because of his "bad additude" Worst off, we never got to work things out, you know, apologize. It'll be sad to not see Chloe, Chris, Sean and Brian again. Brian and Chloe are moving, Chloe out of state. Sean and Chris will be going to a diffrent high school so I'll only see Sean and possibly, but not likely Chris when they come over to my neighbors house. Good thing I'm friends with my neighbor!  On a  lighter  note, only a few more days until I leave for Maine! Plus, now I can sleep in late(lol), and do whatever I want all day long. Well, thats about it for today. Gonna hang out 'round the house for the rest of the day and maybe talk to my friend Evan.

       Only one more day of school! I would of gotten out Friday, but stupid snowdays messed it up. I'm still a bit tired from yesterday. The graduation ended at about 7:30 PM and the dance lasted till 10. And it sucks cuz I went to bed at 11 and had to wake up for 6.   Well, today was simple. Stupid school BBQ with "Rockin Ronnie" as DJ. Kinda pathetic in a way.   Tomorrow will be sad. Why? Cuz a lot of my good friends like Sean and Chris will be leaving for another high school. Also, some of my friends will be moving out of state. I hope I can see them at least once. But overall, tomorrow will be easy. Half Day, most of it spent in homeroom. Seems like a bitter-sweet day to me..
