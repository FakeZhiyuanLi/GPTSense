        I had the day off.  Shari and I mainly hung out, then went to the park with the kids. I'm trying to teach the kids some baseball, but they lose interest after a bit.  Went to eat, came home, yadda yadda yadda.... Just another day in paradise. Then paradise, it became!  Shari took a shower, told me she had a surprise for me.  She came down and had a very sexy outfit on for me.  She put on some dance music, and stripped.  Damn, was she hot!  She grabbed a cat-o-nine-tails, a whip, a paddle, and a vibrator, then laid on the bed and started kissing me.  I used the whips on her, and the vibrator on both of us, at the same time. I blindfolded her, and kissed her in places where she didn't know where I was going, a huge turn on for her. Then we made love, I finished an hour and a half later.  The night turned into the best sex we've ever had.

         Jeremy agreed to watch Lukas for the day, giving Shari a chance to work.  He said anytime we need him to babysit, I'll only be 10 bucks a day, no matter how long in the day.  Pretty good deal.  I picked up Lukas, went home and picked up Shari later.  Nothing exciting today.

       Not really a whole lot went on today, just hung out with my friends for the first time in weeks after work.  My wife works also, but hates her job at Wal-Mart. As far as my writing goes, I gotta keep it up, no matter what, but I need more motivation, which is the main purpose of this journal; let out my thoughts and happenings and see if what I can get.  Tommorow I work late, and will probably be too tired to write, but I'll give it a shot.         Just a few more days till payday, for the both of us! Gotta get my car paid and get the loan back up to date, the problem being that this week we can only do one or the other, being that we both started our jobs a week ago and haven't worked enough to get full paychecks.  The car payment can wait another 2 weeks hopefully, the bank already sent out a letter about the loan. I will be served a court summons in 10 days if I don't bring the loan back up to date by then. So it's obvious what will be more important.

        Went to work till 8pm, again, Shari had the car and took Will to the fair.  The hole in her pocket cost us 150 bucks while she was there.  Went home, went to Wal-Mart, got some food for Lukas.  That would be it for today.
