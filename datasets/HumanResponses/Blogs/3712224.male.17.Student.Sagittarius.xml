      Did you know you can taste mint through your eye?, i just found that out....its not a good idea to take a liquid ice mints and pinch it between your fingers and watch them explode.....they hurt quite a lot when theyre in your eye...however tasting something through something other than your tongue is pretty cool...  Well, at 5pm friday, im leaving to Kalifia for a while, wont be back till July 3rd...i dont wanna go....*

      You're not your job.  You're not how much money you have in the bank.  You're not the car you drive.  You're not the contents of your wallet.  You're not your fucking khakis.  You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.   Well! Now I remember WHY I never go to public pools!  1. Fact: There's more unrine than chlorine. 2. Fact: There's way too much unidentifiable objects. 3. Fact: There's way too much unidentifiable mucus/goo/bodily fluid. 4. Sunburns 5. Annoying little punk six-year-olds who can school you on the diving board.  And, today I have come to the conclusion that Quintin Tarantino is indeed God.

      In the beginning, there was a blank page, and then Enrickay said, Let there be Blog! and there was Blog! But Blog was empty and boring. Then Enrickay said, Im going to bed its 2 in the flippin morning!  And so He went to bed. Only to return the next day to fill Blog with wonderful things.   (Or not so wonderful things, whichever mood he happens to be in...)    Quote de Randomo:   "Don’t take life too seriously; you’ll never get out alive."

        *Receiving messege*    *From: Supreme Global Command*    *Topic: Today*      The end of Yesterday.      Silver harp cords twang.    The song of Fate echos,    Through the timeless Void.    Eternity harkens to its call,     And hears lament.    And Knows the saddened melody.    The last song of Fate plays.    And with a heavy heart,    Eternity takes away the light,    Buries the ashes of time,     And watches the cosmos pass away.....      *End Messesge*     etouq modnar- There is no such thing as right and wrong, there's just popular opinion.

      ||i’  u r lani hul num peryo te elhath marlu udaineve’  Just saw King Arthur, holy crap, that was an awesom movie, I loved every bit of it. And the near nudity and kick assedness of Keira Kinghtly (Gwenevere) upped the movie from a 9.99999 to a 12.5. And call me sick....but with the knives, the warpaint, and a bit of blood, Keira was one hot ass-woopin Pagan.
