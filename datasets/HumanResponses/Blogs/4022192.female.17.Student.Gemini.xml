      i figure if you wanna get to know me, you gotta know my friends first. thoughit's a little more complicated than that. you see, i call myself a floater.not because i can swim or anything, which, as terrible as it is, i cannot,but because i travel between different groups of friends. sure i miss somethings. but hey, i love all of them in their own ways, and i don't not mindnot being a part of only one group, i love it that way.    Group One  description: seven mostly cute, straight-edge, soon-to-be college freshmen (except one), one of whom is my  urlLink boyfriend .  reasons why i love them: eight boys + one girl = attention galore. greatmovie-partners, advice-givers, and cuddle-ers. easy to tickle. always a sourcefor good "clean" fun (though all have dirty minds). can feel like i'm corruptingthe innocent.   reasons why i don't fit in: not a guy. i like to, as they call it, party.i have created some jealous tensions, and i have more sexual experience thanten times them all combined.    Group Two  description: five fabulously fun, dare-to-be-different, new york city girls, all except one my age.  reasons why i love them: ROCKY HORROR GAL PALS (equally in love and obsessedwith both the cast and the movie itself). actresses all. intelligent conversationalists.internet trend-setters. seem to feel blessed to have me. best underwear partiesever.   reasons why i don't fit in: they're too damn intelligent. while i maybe up to their acting, i cannot sing for the life of me. i cannot keep upwith their trivia and have not been around from the beginning, and in fact,was hated in the beginning.    Group Three  description: three almost as short, same-aged, fly chicas.  reasons why i love them: goofy as all hell. love categorically girliethings (shopping, boys, etc.). always excited for a night out. have wonderfulsame-size-as-me clothes.   reasons why i don't fit in: they're too damn pretty, and i'm afraidof competition over boys, grades, etc.. i have friends of whom they don'tapprove.    Group Four  description: too many to count riotous alchies and the like. aka, any thing's funny when you're that fucked up.  reasons why i love them: source for any drug, and center for drunkendebauchery. understand a need for "relaxation." parents are always away.serve up cute guys and good times.   reasons why i don't fit in: have drifted away from them recently findingother passions. i care too much about school and am never up on the gossip.   Group Five  description: two i-hate-everything-so-choose-to-be-outcast sorta-punk boys.  reasons why i love them: really chill people with interesting and differenttheories on life. fun to scare people with. good music and movies.   reasons why i don't fit in: rather soap-opera-like relationship withone of the two. i have other friends besides them. i do not hate the worldor myself (most of the time).    Group Six jess  *group order does not at all mean order in my heart  **royal apologies to those who object to being placed in stereotypicalcategories such as these. you have my permission to hit me.   ***there are also some glaring exceptions of which i am fully aware,people are part of a group but who do not reflect the picture of it i havemade. you know who you are. please don't kill me.

      at the request of some very wonderful people (one in particular), and as you, my readers (that's right, all two of you), can see, i have started a blog. now, as a self-proclaimed commitment-phobe i must first warn you all that you should not expect consistent updating. you see, it is my belief that the people who would have the most to write about are too busy doing it to actually be writing about it. this is not to say that i recently have nothing to do, just that i've decided to devote an occasional hour of my life (from sometime between two and four in the morning) to the maintenance of the blog in question. but i digress. i also probably spelled that wrong. that is why for this said entry i shall propose a disclaimer:  warning. the material you are about to read (maybe next week) is not suitable for people who don't already know and love me. for only those eight million will be able to forgive the constant spelling errors and probable obsessiveness that shall comprise my ramblings to come.   my advice? sound stuff out and skim (says my insecure self)....please love me—i—mean—it (says my vulnerable self)....suck it up and die (says my irritable self)....but most of all, read and love because anything i write turns to pure gold (says the happily me self)

      she wakes up. gently batting her eyes, the color has been drawn from her face (and the bed and the carpet and the...). "i just had the most wonderful dream" she says, bewildered, (pointing to the other people in the room) "and  urlLink you  were there, and  urlLink you  were there and  urlLink you  were there...."   but unlike my southern friend, mine was not a dream. eeeeeee.
