      11/29/2229                        Chapter one Josh Johnson                                  Journal one     	 Swords clashed and everywhere men were crying out in pain.  	Friends were bellowing their victories to one another as they fought side by side. 	The cobblestone road was dark and slick with heavy rain and the life’s blood of hundreds of royal soldiers and local peasants. Scores lay helplessly, dying. Their lives trickled away in streams to mingle in pools with the blood of enemies and neighbors alike. Despite the obstacles, a battle unexpected raged in the center of the small town. 	Women and older children’s' faces pressed to windows, watching in horror as their men and boys were slaughtered. 	 	The reason for the battle was the rebellion of the people in the kingdom. Many did not agree with the laws and rose up together after many months of preparation. There, in the center of the square was a young boy, nearly a man. The boy said a few un-recordable words, as they were magic ones. As he spoke there was a great flash of lightning and a seemingly unconscious girl, a beautiful girl surrounded by light that disappeared as she came to rest in the boy's arms. The fighting had come to a complete stop. There came a gasp and a woman screamed as she shoved her way to the front of the crowd. 	"What has happened to my daughter?! Please just let her alone! What have you done to her?! Esmarinda! Can you hear me?! Answer me!" The woman fell to her knees sobbing incoherent words to the ground.  	"Do not despair my good lady, she is only sleeping. She will not wake until the time is right. I shall take all the women folk of any man that was fighting here today, or any man that fights in a war from this day on. You must spread the news. If you get worse and don't release your pride and anger you will not only never get your women and girls back, you will loose your boys up to the age of ten. This will continue until you yourselves are taken prisoners in my possession, in my kingdom!” the last sentence he yelled yet he didn't raise his voice. This was because he was a mage of some kind. An arrow was shot straight at his heart yet it did not pierce him; it fell away in flames, landing harmlessly on the ground.   	He spoke more magic words and a silver mist settled over the town and was gone as suddenly as it had appeared. The women and girls were gone. No flash, no boom, no smoke, they just disappeared. So did the boy. 	This went on for a long time, year after year. Girls and women disappearing, the wars never getting better, but never worse. The words of the boy, now named The Thief, spread across the lands. The reason he was called The Thief, was because men from all over the kingdoms searched for the boy, his kingdom, and their loved ones, for centuries, never succeeding, or least never returning.... 	 	"Excellent job Johnson!" Boomed a voice coming from all directions at once. 	"Huh? Wha?" I said, confused 	"Your paper, you did a great job. As usual."  	My English teacher. Ok. I was back on track. I must have been dreaming about it as I read it to the class.  	My name is Joshua...er.... Josh Johnson, I'm 15, and I have brown hair and eyes. I am 5 foot 11 inches, which makes me as tall as my dad was when he left.  	He left when I was two, but not permanently, he just went on a journey. He was an adventurer, which is why my mom fell in love with him.  	 	My dad disappeared on his last trip, and was never heard from again. My mom and I know he is alive, but he was pronounced dead because they didn't want to search any longer I guess. He said, right before he vanished, that he had found a window or a door into another world. It didn't seem to be dangerous, so he said he would continue to investigate. The entire team he was with at the time of the disappearance didn't have any idea what happened, they had gone completely crazy when they were found. They were put in an institution because they had tried to kill themselves shortly after they were sent home. The five men were completely useless because they didn't make any sense to the examiners that questioned them. They made perfect sense to Mom and me though. They said that there was a lot of multicolored light and a long twisty tunnel just after Dad stepped in front of the window. When the light was gone, so was Dad. Pretty freaky no? He was a really brave man.  	Mom loved books alot, which is where I got my love of reading and writing.  My favorite subject is English, because, as you can see from my homework assignment, on the page above, I have a crazy imagination. I always get A's. I don't do to well in math and history, or, for that matter, much of anything else. I mean I get B's and C's. The only things I'm good at really is, well, science, English, art, and P.E., but only because I like it. Esmarinda, I don't know why you were in this dream of mine, because as you know, I didn't know you yet. That's probably my stupid destiny kicking in again. Oh well.  OK. Back to my story. 	The last bell rang but I stayed seated. I learned never to try to get out first when you're only second priority. You will get knocked down, squashed, and left behind. The line went passed in the regular order. Jocks and cheerleaders, Normal people, the foreign language speakers, then the computer geeks. I squeezed my way in between the Jocks and the Normal people, all the while getting pinched, poked, stepped on, and shoved. I weaved my way to my locker, as I got there I ran into a girl that I thought I'd seen before. She gave me a beautiful smile and said, 	"Hey, like, you're new here, right? Like, I'm Kim. What's your name?" 	"Josh. No, I've been going here for a year." I replied in a monotone. She was all ditzy girl, of that I was positive. 	"Oh, well you're pretty cute, but I already have a boyfriend " she said, slightly abashed "Well, it was, like, nice to meet you" Her smile still bright "Josh." she added. She looked passed me with a delighted look on her face.  	Wonderful, now I'd get a bashing from her boyfriend for talking to her! Why does this have to happen?! Now I'll have to run around the block five or six times to loose him and get yelled at for being home late. 	 "Hi Robbie!" I turned around and saw my best friend and ex-enemy Robert Bryant. He gave us one of his rare, award-winning smiles. He gave Kim a one armed hug and a quick kiss. Realization dawned on me and apparently it showed on my face. This was Kim Jansen, Rob's girlfriend! Rob's grin widened as he saw the look on my face, he winked at me. The look on his face said "Duh!"  I rolled my eyes at him and winked back. Kim was to busy flashing smiles and batting her eyelashes at Rob to notice we were talking behind her back.  	"Look, Kim, I gotta go now. Um I'll call you later on today. Okay?" Said Rob as he detached himself from her grip. 	"Uh-huh," She replied not seeming to listen. Just to see if she was, I said, 	"Can I kiss you goodbye?" 	"Sure." Was the reply. 	"Are you a ditz with no brain?" I asked her in an innocent voice. 	"Oh yes." She replied smiling sweetly at Rob again. 	"OOH! Ouch!" Rob said wincing. I raised my eyebrows and coughed, covering up my laughter. 	"I just wanted to know if she agreed with me." I told him, innocence dripping from my voice. 	"Whatever. Can we leave now and you can lecture me on girl qualities the whole way home." Rob told me   "Crap! Now I actually have to listen to what you say."           I snorted and headed outside with Rob trotting after me. 	While he grabbed his hoverboard and stuck it under his arm to follow me, I was already thinking about my next assignment for class, another story, then I realized Rob was talking to me. 	", And I think she is just really sweet, and she's sincere too. I really want to stick with her!" Rob said with a worried look on his face. 	"She's fine if you really like her. If she's just for show then loose her fast dude cause she'll weigh you down. If you do love her, then I approve. Not that you care that I think she is, no offense, a brain dead cheerleader.” I finished with a twirl around a pole that sent my long coat flying. I spread my arms wide." Not that you would change your mind if I didn't like her." I laughed 	"So what are you doing today," Rob asked me laughing as I did a cartwheel tumbling into the neighbors' grass and doing a summersault, landing on my feet "Besides trying out for the cheerleading squad?" I made a face at him, and then pretended to think hard. 	"Hmmmmm..... I was thinking about the circus in Spain--- but the one in Italy sound much more sophisticated.  I can see it now," I spread my hands in front of me, imitating a headline on a newspaper, ""JOSHUA JOHNSON NEW ACROBAT FOR THE ITALLIAN CIRCUS EARNS MILLIONS!!!!!" Sounds great, has a wonderful ring to it, don't you think?" I grinned at him "Oh, and I was planning to go to the golden state, get a tan, and find a girl on some beach." 	"Man, sounds like a busy afternoon, you going to have time to get to the theatre and have time to play me a round of chess?" 	"Holy Monkeys! I forgot about theatre! Are you sure it's tonight!?" I yelped, fairly alarmed, having not practiced my lines at all. 	"Positive Josh, you have been reminding me all week to practice my lines, and I checked with the coach, it is tonight. Please don't tell me you forgot to practice!?" 	"Looks to me like Italy, the squad, and chess will have to wait! I need to practice, you going to help me?" 	"Gasp! You. Forgot. Theatre!? Dude is your brain skewed? When have you ever forgotten theatre!? Oh yeah, you had an English assignment. How stupid of me, you have to get an 'A' on every one of those stupid story projects." he rolled his eyes and leapt sideways falling on top of me as someone blew past on a hoverboard. He quickly jumped back up and yelled after the maniac driver. 	 "Oy! If I am singed or so much as bruised I'm calling my lawyer! I'll sue!" 	"What lawyer?" I asked dryly curious. 	"He don't know that." Rob replied. 	"Got it." I nodded and my phone rang. 	"Hello? Josh he-----" 	"Josh," a woman's voice gasped, interrupting me "Please... Come… Home...” the woman was my mom. 	"Mom? What's wrong?" the other line went dead. I called home then Mom's cell, but no one answered. 	"What's up?" asked Rob. I closed my phone and answered, 	"Mom just called, she needs help I think. She sounded bad and she wanted me home. I'll call you later." I frowned  "Hey, can I use your board? It might be important" 	"Sure, here. Hope everything's all right." He looked slightly worried as he handed me the board. 	"Thanks. I'm sure it'll all be fine. I'll give this to you later. See ya." 	"Yeah, see ya." 	I jumped on and pressed my foot on the gas. As I sped down the road I swerved around people getting many curses on my health, and a few  'Stupid teenagers! Shouldn't be allowed to ride anything faster than a row boat!'  That's what they would like, but I'd like to see them try to take away our speed! 	As I pulled up to the front door, I noticed it was open. That's strange; Mom never leaves it open like that. There were skid marks on the  driveway and the street beyond to and from the house. I wonder what's going on.  	As I entered the house, I noticed other strange things. A vase, shattered on the floor, a chair knocked over, and an upended table with a broken glass of water beside it. Things did not look normal here 	"Mom, where are you?" No answer. 	"Mom?" still nothing. I ran through the entire house calling for Mom. Needless to say, I didn't find her, but I found something else. A letter on the counter that said:     	Dear Mr. Johnson, We have taken your mother to the Shadow Woods Hospital. Please accept our apologies for the broken vase and anything that may have been disturbed. If you give us a call, we will give you information on your mother's condition. We have someone coming over to your house to take care of things for a while, or you may call us and you may stay with any local relatives. 				Sincerely, 			Shadow Woods Hospital     	That shook me up a little. Mom in a hospital!? What happened!? I have to call them; they'll give me answers! I rushed to the phone and found the town directory, dialed the number, and waited. They answered on the ninth ring; I was about to hang up. 	"Hello, welcome to Shadow Woods Hospital’s Customer Service Center.---" 	"Yes! I would like to speak to the doctor for---" 	" If you would like to make an appointment, press one. If you would like to speak with a supervisor, press two. If you would like to hang up, press three." It was a recording. I quickly followed the directions and after a few long minutes, I got through to a real person. 	"Supervisor, how may I help you?" A woman's voice drawled, bored. 	"Um, My name is Josh Johnson, my Mom is there and they left me a note and I dunno what's going on and---" I rambled on until the woman interrupted me. 	"Sweetie, slow down. Now tell me what's wrong. Your Mom is here right?" 	"Yes and I---" 	"What's her name Hon'?"  	"Mary Johnson. Is she---” 	"She's here. She's been diagnosed for an acute heart attack." My heart nearly stopped 	"Is she ok!? Is she dead? What happened?" 	"She's not dead, but she's not doing to well honey. Hold on, her doctor is right here, you can talk to him." 	"Hello?" 	"Is she going to live!?” I blurted out, panicked. 	"She has left this world son. How old are you?" I dropped the phone.  Dead...Dead...Dead...DEAD! 	"Son? Son?" the Doctor shouted, his voice muffled by the distance between the ground and my ear. I picked up the phone and said 	" Thank you sir." and hung up. I began to shake, going into a state of shock. The backdoor opened, and I desperately thought Mom! I knew she couldn't be dead! Of course in my heart, I knew the truth My Mother, the one who loved and raised me, was dead. 	The pottery from the broken vase crunched under heavy shoes and I jumped nearly a foot. Was it the person who came to take care of things here? They probably would have knocked. Then who was it? As I turned to go out the door in my room, which lead outside, (which can be VERY helpful for sneaking out) I jumped again. A hideous face, belonging to a mutant animal/human mixed thing, was pressed up against my window. The thing sneered and, gets this, roared. The neighbors won't be too happy to have a human half-breed running around the neighborhood growling and snapping at people. I was living proof, except the human/animal thing part. Man, this stuff never ends once it starts, does it!? You finally get what you want, find out it isn't all that great, and things keep adding to it to make it just the way you want it. By now you are absolutely sick of it and don't want it anymore. Wonderful. The thing broke my window and I became all about the now. I ran the other way, straight into another mutant thing, just my luck. Thankfully I'm not really big, in height, weight, or muscle, so I slipped around him, it, whatever. I flew down the stairs with the guys right on my tail. They kind of looked like those flying monkey things on The Wizard of Oz, without the wings. They were blue and everything. Way freaky, no? The guy right behind me dived and grabbed my legs and I fell on my face. Ouch. I squirmed and wriggled then I kicked his face as well as I could with my feet being held together and all. I kicked one more time as hard as I could. I heard something break and the thing, let me loose. I bolted for the front door, blasting past a man who looked stunned. No one could be more stunned than me. In the past few minutes, my mom died, things breaking all laws of science attacked me, and there is a stranger in my house I've never seen before in my life. I'm afraid to ask, but can things get any worse!?
