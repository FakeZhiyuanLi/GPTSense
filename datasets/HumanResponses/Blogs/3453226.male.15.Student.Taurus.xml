      One day, 3 women, a blonde, a brunette, and a red head, traveled to America.  Because they skipped customs, they were taken to prison and charged as being communists.  After a quick trial, all 3 were sentenced to the chair.  The red head was up first.  "I just graduated from theology school, and I know the grace of God is with me.  Because of this, I will not die."  They threw the switch, but nothing happened.  They quickly let her go.  The the brunette was up.  "I graduated from Law School, and I know the judicial system will save me."  Again, they threw the switch, but nothing happened.  They let her go too.  Then the blonde was up.  "I just graduated from an electrical school, and I know for a fact that this chair won't work until you plug it in."

      I have had many requests to put in a post about the annoying teachers at my school.  We all have them, but not all of us get to put them on a web site.  Probably my number one least favorite teacher is a guy named Mr. Wright.  Take his actions last week for example.  "Sorry about this, but I am required to teach you guys how to write a college level research paper.  Seeing as how we only have 2 weeks left of school, I think it is a good idea I spring this on you now.  I don't know what I want from you guys yet, but go ahead and get started, I might feel like coming up with those details later."  Another one of my particularly distasteful picks would have to be my orchestra teacher, Mr. Kibler (Keebler).  He decided to let only the upperclassman on the computers in the room, and password protect the computer and give all the older kids the password, leaving us freshmen and sophomores with bull.  "I decided you guys aren't good enough to go on the computers, so I shut you all off of them.  When you guys have a study hall, you're just SOL."  It's not that he's a bad teacher, he's just freakin' annoying.  Now that I have had a turn to vent, I invite you all to share some of your annoying teachers with the rest of these great readers.

      Hey guys I'm here!  I've been gone a long time down here in SC. I haven't been able to log onto the internet because the internet is hooked with the cable company, and since they're such screw-ups down here it'll take another month or so for me to have cable, internet and a ground phone line. Once I'm up and running I'll be more active on this site and my own! Glad to see that Liz took some time to tell you guys that I'm still alive (thanks Liz!) Anyway, gotta run, at a new friends house! Bye all!   P.S. Andrew... you be good now.

      It's summer time and I've spent the last two days playing solitaire and Zelda.  Wow, I am a loser. My mom just said to me, "Why is it the rich people get so much stuff!?!"  Then she went into this lengthy explanation about bank accounts and other stuff.

           Well, the last day of school was today, and all I can say is FINALLY!!!!!  This summer is going to be a blast for all of us, but one chunk of it will be missing.  One of my best friends, Goran, will be moving to Myrtle Beach (lucky bum!!!).  Today is probably the last day I will see him for a long time, until that is, the big bus trip to go to Goran's new house!!!!  Sign up @ Marsbar988@aol.com.  Until then, farewell Goran.  East will miss you, and so will I.  Peace out!!!  P.S.  Check out the photo below!

      Well, since we all love the song "Dare You to Move," I went on a mission to find out exactly what the word "fallout" means.  As we all know, the word occurs in the song at the beginning of the second verse where the lead singer (blonde guy with the very nice hair, though I must admit, I prefer the bassist's hair.) sings, "Welcome to the fallout, welcome to existence...Et cetera."    Below is the dictionary definition:     fallout n.   1.  The slow descent of minute particles of debris in the atmosphere following an explosion, especially the descent of radioactive debris after a nuclear explosion.    Jiggawats?  I don't know about y'all, but I had to read that a few times before I understood what was going on. Mildly understood. I really don't understand.  I couldn't explain it to you that is (that means don't ask.)  So what is Switchfoot trying to say here?  Is it the apocalypse brought upon my nuclear war?  Switchfoot has Christian themed music (Joc saw them at Creation.) so maybe this has a deeper meaning?  Did the Straylight Run have to look up what fallout meant too, and then named their song "slow descent" because of the definition?  All I know is that I was being mislead as to what "fallout" meant....and they told us to use context clues in school...psh...
