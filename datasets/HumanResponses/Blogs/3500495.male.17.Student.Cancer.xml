               College applicants all have their own life stories: collections of past events, surroundings, and cultural experiences that not only define what kind of people they have become and how they carry themselves for the present, but also their reveal their level of maturity and ability to function as members of society in the future.  Since a number of aspects and conditions have influenced my development and growth as a person, I find it extremely difficult to single out a sole influence that determined who I have become.  However, the one aspect of life that has set me apart from the group, the event that has taught me to regret the transgressions of the past and yet remain optimistic about the future, the one part of life that has defined, influenced, and motivated me to succeed in life is my father’s desertion of my family when I was barely old enough to comprehend what he had done. 	Though the loss of a parent may seem extremely tragic at first, growing up with only my mother and younger brother has taught me a great deal about life that most teenagers unfortunately do not experience until going off to college and living on their own.  While I became forcefully more acquainted with domestic chores such as cooking for my family, doing laundry, and even gardening, the experience has also brought me to deeper, more meaningful discoveries such as the value of hard work and determination.  To this day, I believe that I can accomplish anything if I work hard enough at it; when I go out and truly work at something, I never let any obstacle stand in my way nor allow any ties restrain my unfettered freedom and goal of doing my best, doing the best, at anything I do.  Whether it be playing Chopin Etudes on the piano, out-driving my friends on the golf course, delegating at Model United Nations Conferences, or getting straight A’s in school, all of my successes (and failures) stem from a sense of self-reliance, responsibility, and diligence all resulting from growing up taking care of the house while my mother went to work. 	Coupled with a disdain of evil in the world and education at a Catholic high school, my resulting strong system of morals and ethics allow for me to have sympathy for the people of the present and optimism for the society of the future.  Growing up in South Florida, an area of strict obligation to follow absolutely no moral code, I aspire to greatness, morality, and most of all happiness.  Still, only strength of mind and resolve to work diligently at a goal with allow me the resolve to meet my objectives. As one esteemed professor once told me, “Persistence overcomes resistance.”  I believe that if you work hard enough at something, persistence will indeed overcome resistance.  Never let anything get in the way of your dreams.

       Boom baby!  I know I swore I'd never make one of these things, but here I am doing it, and here's my blog for the whole world to read and understand my feelings (as if they cared).    It seems like even the people that are close to me don't care about my feelings.  Especially girls.  Hardy har har!  I actually have more guy friends that care about my damn feelings.  Ahh the wonders of girls...Though they have that motherly, caretaker look on the outside, it seems like deep down, girls are nothing but selfish, self-advancing bitches.  Funny how everything this species does it motivated by their own advancement in the world and how everything that a girl says or does is motivated by some deeper desire to get something out of you.    Let's take a certain person for example...ohhh a girl I used to have a thing for at the beginning of the year.  She shall hereon be named "Sweetcakes."  Now you have to understand that back when I liked sweetcakes (aka back when I was stupid), I thought that she was this nice little perfectionist girl who did everything to please others, worked her hardest at everything she did, told jokes, tried to make conversation and keep people happy, went out once in a while not to seem like a loser, was proud of herself, who she was, and what she was to become (all in all, a female version of me).  But oh boy was I wrong.  As it turns out, I had some really great conversations with Sweetcakes, she was an intersting person, funny, and fun to hang out with.  Naturally I was attracted to her (someone please slap me) so I asked her out on a date.  We went bowling.  Oh joy what fun, I won two games and let her win 2 so that she could be appeased.  Keep the girls happy and they will make you happy.  Anyway, 3 hours and $42 later (I was ready to strangle the cashier but decided not to embarrass myself in front of sweetcakes), I took her home.  You know what I got out of this?  A friggin peck on the cheek.  Yea thanks for spending my money, bitch.  So anyway, later I told her how much I liked her and apparently this was a very bad thing to do.  I got the whole "lets just be friends" speech and that was the end of sweetcakes, the selfish, no good, money wasting, whore.  Later I found out just how utterly narcissistic this miracle was.  My friend wanted to throw a party and sweetcakes told her she couldnt have it that weekend because she (sweetcakes) would be out of town and couldnt make it.  Of course, my friend laughed in her face.  This girl absolutely pisses the hell out of me.  Always needing to be accepted, sweetcakes will engage in 10-minute conversations with people we dont even know.  Once at the beach, someone hit this lady in the head with a volleyball and sweetcakes went over and apologized for a full 15 minutes, no exaggeration.  She also sucks up majorly to teachers which pisses me off, though Big Mac has the ability to detect this and hates "that spanish whore."  Big Mac actually gave me weird looks back when I was in the stupid stage.  But anyway, I'm over sweetcakes (repeat x3).    The rest of my girl situation you ask?  How about this...I haven't had a single girlfriend since middle school, I've had 3 stalkers in one year, and all I really want is a good friend thats a girl...someone that I can talk to, someone that I can relate to, share my feelings with.  Ugh!  Hey! Wanna hear another girl horror story?  This one's kinda unresolved at the moment and though it sucks, well whatever.  So at school I do this thing called Model United Nations, which for those of you that don't know, is basically a debate team where everyone gets assigned a country and then has to argue foreign policy about certain topics ranging from the war in Iraq to conservation of water.  So what we do is our school sends like 30 kids to the different conferences (such as Georgetown, Duke, and UF) and we all do our thing yadda yadda.  I really only do MUN because I like to travel and get away from home and my family.  I hate all the work involved, I dont like spending time with Big Mac, the kids are mostly nerds, and it costs a shitload.  But anyway, on a recent MUN trip I met this really really great girl from my school, shes a year younger (stupid sophomores) but man is this girl perfect.  She's hott (u should really see a pic), nice, smart (straight A's), friendly, funny, fun to be with, athletic (mmm those gymnasts are flexible), and she has this great personality that you wouldnt believe.  The girl is every nerd's dream girl: sexy, smart, and she plays video games.  Back to the point, I got to know this girl because I was her mentor of sorts, teaching her how to do MUN, she was in my committee and I had to get her acquainted with how we do things on MUN trips (heh heh).  So anyway, we talked a lot, and became really good friends!  The girl is so cool and she thought I was like godly cool.  However I guess she only thinks of me as a friend...which is err was alright with me cuz I really like spending time with her and whatnot, and its only natural for a guy to be attracted to a girl he likes to spend time with.  Is it possible to have girls that are friends that we dont see as potential girlfriends?  Who knows.  So one night months later, shes telling me about her new boyfriend who I happen to know from school: hes a loser, stupid, drunken, pothead.  I was like WTF! dont do this to me you stupid whore, you can do so much better than this piece of shit bf that u picked out.  She was like what?  I was like ugh! I used to like you but if this is what you go for in guys then I guess I terribly overestimated you.  She's all like "what? you like me?"  Keep in mind, I am terrible at hiding my feelings, especially when it comes to girls, so either this girl is blind or I got lucky and could hide my feelings pretty durn well.  At any rate, she just recently broke up with her bf, or rather, he dumped her to go have sex with someone else.  And I'm like oh dont worry you can do so much better than him anyway.  Right.  Anyway I'm supposed to go over her house some weekend to play video games lol.  Maybe I'll ask her for a date sometime and things will be good.  I can't believe I actually still like her after all the stupid thigns she's done.  Maybe its cuz I want to change her?  Is it possible for us to like people that are below us because we want to raise them up to a higher level?  My Fair Lady all over again....Funny how I played Henry Higgins when we performed the play in school.  A sign of things to come...  So there you have it!  Two failed relationships with girls right down the friggin toilet.  All in all, Girls SUCK!  lol  But don't worry, I'm not gonna turn gay on you guys.  Gay is definitely not something I want to be.  Don't get me wrong, Gays are cool with me and all until they try to start something lol.  Keep in your seperate sphere! Back back I say!  So yea, enough about girls, since they suck and always will suck (literally and figuratively).    Tired...will write more later.
