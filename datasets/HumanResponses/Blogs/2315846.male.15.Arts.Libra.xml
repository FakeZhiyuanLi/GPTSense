        urlLink      urlLink Aragorn .  urlLink Clark Kent .   urlLink Neo . Reluctant heroes that only want to live out normal lives. But history and destiny prevent them from living out their usual day-to-day activities. Many want desperately to be someone they are not. But  THEY  want desperately not be someone they are suppose to be. In the end their real persons came to the forefront and they fulfilled their dreams of bringing about the truth that evil will be eventually overcome in spite of the tremendous odds.  THEY  can do it because they belong to their universe that allows them the possibilities to fulfil those destinies.  Ours, in the real world has an altogether a different setting. We 'fulfil' ours in the realm of fantasy, sci-fi and movie magic, where the will of man to be masters of their lives and when possible, even of the universe, has always been food for imagination. There will always be this secret wish of wanting to be someone to change the world in a spectacular fashion and get to play hero along the way. Who would you like to be?...

       After much attempts & patience...    Thanketh "Fral" for thy honourable invitation (s)  (I had to highlight your efforts =p).    For my maiden post, it'd be a really unfortunate one :   I dealt an (unintentional)&nbsp;big blow to the local percussion scene in&nbsp;the name of publicity, thanks to the negligent me&nbsp;- & the blow backfired. Now both parties are hurt, thanks to the negligent&nbsp;me. I seem to have landed myself in big trouble with many of my mentors & forefathers&nbsp;in the local percussion scene&nbsp;just because of one message.   I'll never be an advertiser in my life - Never.   Trust me, you won't wanna offend anybody - I definitely won't want to.&nbsp;Especially so, if the offended is THE intended audience themselves.   Now I'm beginning to see where my insensitivity leads to.   Well done.&nbsp;

       A friend swears that this was heard of a priest during the eucharistic prayer:  "Let-us-pro-claim-the-mi-se-ry-of-faith!"  Sigh!  I know the feeling.

        Some of what transpired today have given me much food for thought. We all have the capacity to do good but there are times where we go after a certain line of action and convincingly assure ourselves that it is harmless when we know deep down in our hearts it is most certainly  WRONG .    We then become a paradox to ourselves. A situation that becomes a vicious circle that perpetuates one wrong doing after another. Is it no wonder then we always find ourselves in one terrible predicament after the next? Unless, of course, we  break  the cycle.    For many, this ' breaking ' or ' spiritual surgery ', of excising the malignant tumour of our lives, is a tough call. But as they say, ' no pain, no gain '. We can spend tons of money, effort and time to want to look good and be presentable as the next Miss World. But we can't  even spare to lift a finger to cure and overturn our wretched life and eventually save our souls.    Such times we live in! Hamlet was right. To be or not to be. That is the question...

       When to a wake this evening. The deceased was the same person whom I had earlier tried to see at Changi Hospital last Thursday morning. Better yet, I shall be doing the funeral Mass also this Monday morning. What can I say but that God is a great joker!...

       Finally, Mr Black showed us what he is capable of! :D   The moral of the story is: The guy with the gun doesn't always win.   In fact, you'll be surprised at just how lethal  trumpets  coupled with some  yelling  can be (Jos 6:5). :P   Be guai and don't pray pray ok?

       Overheard at a talk on the Lord’s Prayer:  “There was the Big Bang … then one star died and our Earth and the Solar System were born ...  See how we’ve come from the stars?  That’s why when, at night, you look up at the stars, you feel a connexion.”  “Then there was the Black Death in the 13th Century which led to the discovery of Penicillin.”  A friend not given to hyperbole like I am, and whose words are always weighted with wisdom, had this to say of the speaker and the talk: What a scream!

       This is not the ideal of ‘premiere’ messages to post.  It gives the wrong idea.  It suggests arrogance.  And me, arrogant?  Never!  Fr Aloysius put me and another at the helm of overhauling a parish programme.  He calls us ‘consultants’.  I usually brand myself as the Resident 'Kay-Poh'.  But seriously, what we do really, I think, is to be in touch with our God of surprises in searching for creative ways of doing things.    Besides the two Resident 'Kay-Poh's, there are also the ‘do-ers’.  It sounds awfully dismissive and, dare I say it, perhaps even a tad disdainful, of me to call them such, I know.  One of our tasks is to inspire these ‘do-ers’ into appreciating the ‘wherefores’ above the ‘hows’.  I’ve tried.  I’ve often suspected, however, that we’re banging our heads against the wall.  Fr Aloysius and my partner-in-crime, happily, are more sanguine.  Don’t get me wrong, these are genuinely nice people whom I like and who have a great capacity for giving to God and church.  I’ve often been humbled by their dedication. (You’ll see more of that in a moment.)    Sadly, I’ve recently received further confirmation of my secret suspicion …  The ‘poetic license’ I claim is in entertaining inspiration that comes at the last minute.  I mean, it does have more than an inclination for the eleventh hour, doesn’t it, inspiration?  The do-ers have, of course, been absolutely brilliant in executing these last-minute plans.  We're helpless without them.  Absolutely!  I once asked for materials for craft at 4pm on a Saturday.  And, voila!  All was ready by 9am the next day! Oh, bless them, they’re daar-links!  I finally received a plea to spare them of such late notices.  This I entirely understand for it is legitimate and it’s not the cause for any concern.  A plea that I ought to listen to and respect.  They went on to suggest, however, that when ideas come late they can always be executed the next time around.  Sigh!  In this suggestion, I thought, they showed lack of an appreciation for the right activity at the right moment.  And so, in their ‘doing’, I suspect, they hadn’t spent time to see how the realisation of each ‘project’ was a deeper and more fruitful way of approaching the matters and issues at hand.  And therefore, making the ‘project’ a necessary hassle.  How can one put this succinctly?  Indeed, if one doesn’t see the ’holiness’ behind the hassle, then, yeah, of course, the hassle becomes just another hoax!  Hai-yah!  I know it's unfair of me to latch onto this one remark of theirs and come to such a conclusion. However, I can't help but feel that it's indicative of deep differences in approach ...  Worse, I thought I might’ve heard a faint longing for those days when everyone knew exactly what’s to be done for the next session because it’s always the same, leaving little for the imagination … ad infinitum, ad nauseam …  'You think I should come off my high horse?

        With the anaestheasia wearing off and the numbness setting in, I gave the cab driver directions to head for ' urlLink  Katong  church  ' as I left the Dentistry faculty after my dental appointment there. The words came out in slobbering tones and saliva almost flew out from my mouth as I tried to articulate the message. Still, we reached our destination with not much mishap...    Listening is certainly an art and the cabdriver was patient and certainly understanding with my predicament. Getting the message across is another activity that needs to be clear, concise and correct in order to get the desired effect.    I had a phone call this morning at 8.00 a.m. I had just got up then and was still a little groggy. It was a request to go to Changi hospital to see a patient there in the ICU ward. Took down all the details of the ward and bed location, patient's name. The caller insist that I can go down as there would be at least one family member there and that the nurse on duty had assured them that they will allow the priest to enter. However, the caller forgot to leave behind a contact number in case of referral, and I forgot to ask. Rushed down to the ward but found everything to the contrary. No one family member was there and that I was told by the nurse-in-charge through the intercom that I cannot come in except during visiting hours. Bleaahh!    Made arrangements,   through our office,   for another priest to go instead  and rushed off for my dental appointment. Samuel Butler (1835 - 1902) said that " Life is an art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises ". In my case it was probably the other way around...

        Send in my piece for the editorial page for the forthcoming parish newsletter...     &nbsp;   To conduct the last adult confirmation preparation class this evening...     &nbsp;   A niche to install in the columbarium&nbsp;in the afternoon...     &nbsp;   Series of activities and work that define the day. Doing all those and whatever that may crop up along the way, it can be easily forgotten that I may only need to do the following:    a.  act justly -&nbsp;trying to be fair to people who don't want to listen is an act of acquired taste .    b.  love tenderly - try loving the dog that bites the hand of the master...     c.  walk humbly with God - especially when we are going against the other equally 'important' god since time immemorial, ' No Time !' .     &nbsp;   Can we get anymore complicated than this?...     &nbsp;

       Today is my turn at the Advisory Counters. Today, I set out to encounter God for 5 solid hours in the people I meet, who ranges from the  absolutely docile  to the  absolutely demanding/irritating . Today, I set out to bring the Christ that I have encountered over the weekend, yesterday, today, to the people I meet. Today,  My Daily Bread Chp 107 Nature and Grace  tells me   "Nature is irritated at unkind and harsh words, but grace knows how to keep an even temper in the face of cruel and mean persons."   and it ends with a prayer, similar to one that has been  imbued  in me...    "Grant me grace to be more for You and less for this blind and unreasoning self within me. Amen."   May this prayer be for you as much as it is for me.  My duty begins in 3 mins...

        A new beginning for this entry that charts a new course for thoughts and ideas on what we are doing with our lives these days. Each of us have one life to live. What are we doing to give it values that matter most and enriching the moment with worthwhile activities?    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

         Thank You .  That was the design printed on the card sent to me thanking me for the funeral conducted for the deceased whom I had tried to visit in the hospital last month. The same deceased family whom I was wondering if they were concern for the  urlLink priest visit at the hospital  when the deceased was in ICU then.  Anyway, it was thoughtful of them to sent a thank-you card as this is the first one I received since I started doing funeral services in this parish. They said  "We will always remember the beautiful ceremony you conducted in the church  ". I was, initially, rather  urlLink reluctant  to celebrate the funeral for them but I thought it was the only Christian and compassionate thing to do and the deceased deserved a decent farewell. So, my entire focus for that celebration was for the deceased and I was having mixed feelings about how the rest of the family were taking to the funeral mass as half of them were non-Catholic.  Now I know.

       His Grace came down on Sunday evening to confer the Sacrament of Confirmation to 105 then-confirmants. After using his previous story* at a couple of Confirmation Masses, he gave a new one today:   There were 3 men who were vying to catch their last train home. So they ran & ran, and they knocked into a small stall where a small lil' boy was selling apples for a living. 2 of the 3 men continued running; the 3rd ran for a while - then he stopped. He went back, and picked up the spoilt/damaged apples. Giving some money back to the boy as compensation, he noticed that the boy was blind. Taking the money, the boy anxiously asked:       "Are You Jesus?"    *The previous story:   There were a few parishoners attending Mass in a village church, when suddenly a few guerillas stormed in, armed. They surrounded the parishoners, struck with much fear. And then, they asked this question - "Whoever believes in Jesus Christ, pls stand."      The priest stood up first (=D) . One, two, then three...Only a few stood up - the rest remained for fear that they'll be executed. Indeed, they thought their worst fear was becoming a reality, when the guerillas led the ones who stood up, out of the church & closed the doors behind them. Those in the church was waiting for the worst to happen... BANG! - BANG-BANG! A few gunshots were fired... And cries erupted from the church.      The guerillas opened the doors, and to the surprise of those inside - The priest &amp; the few others with him were safe & sound. The guerillas brought them back inside the church &amp; then they said: "Those who were inside the church just now, you don't deserve to be in here." They apologised to the priest & asked them to continue with Mass...     What His Grace was trying to convey in all of his homilies for Confirmation Masses, is that we must be witnesses of Christ. In his current story, he highlighted the importance of kindness &amp; compassion to others - A simple act like that can mean so much to others...Through simple actions, we can bring Christ to others. In his previous one, he touched on faith &amp; courage that is imparative for us to be witnesses of Christ in all kinds of situations.  We should reflect periodically, if not always - our actions, and ask ourselves if our actions are testimony to Christ's Presence in us. And if they are not, what should we be doing to rectify them?  That's the challenge.
