      So today the news is mainly about a possible terrorist threat, a plane possibly being hijacked from Canada to hit a U.S. target, lots of scary "clear and present danger" talk.  Apparently they are just re-releasing old details because they think there is an "imminent" attack.  The thing is, every time this stuff hits the news, I do get nervous.  Tell me I am paranoid, and just slightly too far under the influence of the American fear machine.  I'm sure I am.  But the thought of risking anything to go to this miserable client meeting next week just makes me angry.  Actually, it's the thought that I even have to consider this stuff that makes me really angry.  But anyway.  Game 2 tomorrow night - Go Flames Go!  And it sure does look like  urlLink the mayor of San Jose is a good sport .

      My uncle died last night, from cancer.  The memorial service will be the same weekend as my grandmother's, in June.  A and I already have made travel arrangements to be in Kingston then.

       urlLink      So tonight we find out who  urlLink Calgary  is going to play in the Stanley Cup Finals.  I'm still getting over the fact that we are IN the finals.  I mean, I have been a Flames fan since I moved here, and A has been one pretty much his whole life, so we have gone to as many games as we could - but we never even guessed it would get this good.  I mean, the freaking FINALS!!!!  I am a LITTLE excited.  I have to admit to a huge crush on Miikka too.  I just like how calm and modest he seems, and heck - he's an amazing player.  The picture above is the only I've ever seen when he's smiling.  Maybe it's a Finnish thing, who knows.

      Last night we went to see Troy in Eau Claire, and then had a beer.  The movie made me think of my  urlLink first year Archaeology course , with the German professor (can't remember his name), who was so completely the stereotypical professor of Classical Studies, and how we'd have to memorize a bunch of slides, then write one-pagers on them for the exam.  I honestly don't think I retained much of anything.  I mostly remember how he described how  urlLink Schliemann  had excavated Troy but done it wrong, so all the layers were jumbled up, to support his own theories - which ended up confusing everyone interested in ancient Greek culture for years.     The movie was pretty good, even if kind of predictable ("Hey!  The Trojan horse!", "When is Achilles' heel going to come into it?").  Peter O'Toole was great, the actor who played Hector was really good as well, and Brad was, well, Brad.  We did see his naked bum again.  Yum.

      I can't stand the leaders' debate.  I wish I could just stand up there, ask a question, and say "if anyone interrupts anyone else, consider yourself having lost my vote."  Honestly, it's so completely unproductive.  Paul Martin seemed flustered, and Jack Layton does a super annoying hand thing, and is also the absolute worst at talking over everyone else.  Stephen (ugh) Harper seemed composed and calm, but he just can't disguise his agendas.  You know, it's really too bad Gilles Duceppe is a separatist, he seemed like the most reasonable, logical and well-mannered one there.

      Well, here I am at 26.  We had a nice dinner at  urlLink the Livingroom  on Friday night, with C and B.  We shared a cheese fondue for an appetizer which was amazing, and some kind of crepes that were basically fajitas, and then I had the gnocchi for my main course.  We were too stuffed for the Bernard Callebaut chocolate fondue for dessert, so we'll have to go back another time just for that.  A tried to make me a cake yesterday - he saw something on the Food Network and wanted to be ambitious.  I was in the livingroom and suddenly heard some banging and swearing coming from the kitchen, and when I went in there was cake all over the counter and he had turned around and walked away from the cake, like it had offended him somehow.  Apparently it's not easy to make a layered cake, you have to flip it over just so...  We went and saw the new  urlLink Harry Potter  as well.  This is the one about my favourite book, so I was looking forward to it, but didn't want to build it up too much in my mind.  It was much darker than I had even expected - I mean, I didn't want another Chris Columbus movie, but we've definitely taken a leap beyond what I would consider a kids' movie at this point.  Good, all in all, but not what I was expecting.  I felt like there were pieces missing.  The great thing about this book was the smart plot, and how many different pieces came together in the end perfectly.  I didn't get the same sense of satisfaction from the movie.  We cooked dinner for A and V tonight at their place.  J is adjusting much better to being a big sister.  She's so funny - she told V that she was a "really good parent" and her dad that he was "a great man".  It might mean more if she had more than a 3-year-old frame of reference.  P is officially a member of the family now - she's so small, it's hard to believe people start out that way.  We had a nice snuggle tonight, she seems to be a good sleeper.  Earlier this afternoon I went shopping and somehow lost something I'd bought.  This has never happened to me before.  It wasn't in any of my other bags, or my purse.  Maybe I  am  starting to lose my mind, I didn't realize it started at 26.

      Argh.  I can't believe we lost Game 7!  It was a great run though, and really brought the city together.  I think that's pretty important too, considering how many people came here from somewhere else, and need something to reinforce that this city is home.  I went to the Saddledome to watch the game on the big screens they set up, with C and B, who is back from London and Russia for a few weeks.  I was in the line-up for the women's washroom between periods, and almost was at the front of the line, when a girl and her mom were coming out of the washroom, walking past me.  The girl had an ice cream cone, and all the ice cream fell off suddenly in one big ball.  On to the floor.  The gross, wet, dingy, stepped-on, sewage-and-whatever-else-covered, 1000-women-a-night, Saddledome washroom floor.  The mom picks up the ice cream, sticks it back on the cone and says, "five second rule!".  I almost gagged.  What kind of person doesn't realize that the five second rule does NOT apply to the washroom at Saddledome?  I mean, come ON!  When I got back to my seat C and B were eating ice cream, and I couldn't even look at it.

      I'm stuck in Timmins tonight and tomorrow night visiting a client.  This place is a Shania Twain circus.  The first thing you see when you leave the airport is a huge billboard advertising the International Shania Fan Convention.  The hotel I am staying at has a Shania Twain suite, and there is a Shania Twain Convention Centre down the road.  It's frightening.  So anyway, I'm super lonely, combined with highly nervous about this meeting.  The last few days have been total chaos and I haven't had a second to myself to sort out my head.  A's family has been visiting since last Thursday, and as nice as it is to see them, it's just too many people in the house for an extended period of time for me to deal with and stay sane.  Two hyper toddlers are fine in moderation, but not for days on end in a small house.  Literally there was nowhere to go to sit down and be alone, which is a big deal for an introvert like me.  It just sucks my energy out completely.  Then in the middle of the night, I guess very early Sunday morning, I got a call from my cousins saying it was time.  So I pulled myself out of bed and went to their place to stay with J, and barely slept.  The new little papoose was scheduled to come home yesterday, after the lawyers and social workers were through with things.  I have seen digital pictures, and she is gorgeous.  I am focusing on how happy I will be to meet her and hold her when I get home, and that is helping me through this trip.  I am holding off on celebrating officially until the 10 days are over though.  But I barely slept on the weekend.  All this, plus lots of pressure at work.  My boss thinks I'm negative.  I am - for this ONE client.  I like all the others.  I think this position is just wrong for me.  It doesn't play to my strengths.  I don't have thick skin, and I'm no good at being fake.  If someone tries to manipulate me, I just resent it and lose all respect for them - I can't just take it in stride.  I also think they don't fully understand what I go through with this account, and what it's like to constantly be putting out fires that our company has created for ourselves.  When the client relationship is generally positive, even if there are a few bumps now and then, I am fine with it.  But when it's an ongoing adversarial relationship where the main contact is a manipulative, fake, egotistical brat it's different - especially if some of his concerns are legitimate because of stupid things our company has done.  I am not an apologist.  I can't live my life this way.  And honestly, it's just not worth all the heartache it causes in my life.  I should have just stayed in the role I was in.

      It's bloody hot.  We seem to only be able to find enough strength to lie on the couch in such a way that no one's body parts touch.  But as a trade-off, it's  urlLink Stampede , which means free concerts, beer tents and feeling nauseous after too many of Those Little Donuts.  I never in my life thought I would actually own a cowboy hat, but after being through three Stampedes with near sunstroke and dressed in a distinctly un-western style (yes, Stampede is something you "go through"), last year I caved and bought one.  Heading out this year I was told I looked "sexy, in a  urlLink Terri Clark  sort of way", but soon discovered that cowboy hat wearing while carrying on a conversation is slightly more complicated than it may seem when you are drinking beer with hundreds of your closest friends in close quarters.  a) A is 6'6'' tall.  This means that the hat blocks any and all conversation below him.  It's okay to talk to people around my height, but my neck gets tired after a couple of hours of regularly craning to say something to A.  On the plus side (?), everyone else can discuss him right under his nose.  b) Talking to people my own height is no easier really.  When anyone leans in to hear better, the hats bonk, since no one is used to wearing them ("Oops!  I'm sorry."  "Sorry!" (adjust hat) "What was I saying?").  Even people pushing to try to get by in the crowd ended up bonking my hat from behind, so I'd bonk the person next to me, etc., in one long hat-bonking chain reaction.  New Stampede accessory next year, I think:  boots.

      We got home from work tonight and there was a note under the kitchen door (that leads to the downstairs apartment) on a big chunk of cardboard.  The note was from the girl downstairs, who is moving out after the entire basement flooded last weekend in the torrential downpour.  She wasn't even home when it happened - she was camping, but we were checking on her place for her.  The flood wrecked the carpets, seeped into the walls and ruined a lot of her stuff, including her school yearbooks and family bibles which were sitting on the floor of her closet, and that I tried (not very successfully) to salvage as soon as we discovered the mess.    A read the note to me tonight while I was doing something else - "she says thanks for helping her out, and there are 15 plant pots in the laundry room if you want them, but you might want to repaint them."  Ummm, okay.  Turns out there are 150 - yes, 150 - mini plant pots in the laundry room, just waiting for me to find uses for.  Each painted pink, with purple letters spelling out her name and "Jason", with a wedding date in 2002.  Plus three packages of party bubbles.  What on earth does she think I am going to do with this stuff other than throw it out?  Because I have 150 mini cacti looking for homes and I'm really going to go through the trouble of re-painting them?  Anyway, I guess that explains the wrapped-up dress in her closet I saved from hanging in the water, and why she was kind of an emotional wreck when she moved in two years ago.  She seems happy with her new guy, so I can only wish her the best and hope our next neighbors are as nice.  It's strange to finally know some of the background story after living so closely for quite a long time.

       urlLink     On Saturday, on our way home, A and I noticed a huge menacing-looking black cloud just above the city, on an otherwise blazing hot day.  Halfway home it started to rain.  Then pour.  Then it was like someone was just whipping each droplet at us, and then finally they added huge chunks of hail to the mix.  About 10 blocks from home, I thought the windshield was going to break.  Lots of people had pulled over under trees, which really didn't help against the hail (now going horizontally), but it was impossible to see more than 10 feet ahead of you.  We kept going since we were almost home, passing a manhole cover that had popped off and which was emitting about 6 feet of muddy water, straight up like a kind of urban geyser.  The streets were overflowing rivers in spring, complete with rapids.  We went through an intersection where the water didn't go over the hood of the car only because we were going about 10km/h.  By the time we turned down our street, we couldn't pull in because of the lake in front of the driveway, so we parked in the backyard and when we got up the courage to jump out and run into the house, my foot first landed in an icy knee-height puddle.  And then, before you knew it, it was over, leaving banks of hail in its wake.  By the time I thought to get the camera, the water had died down to an ebb and the sun was shining again.

       urlLink      This picture of Saturn's southern hemisphere taken by the Cassini spacecraft cameras shows a banded appearance due to winds, as well as dark cyclonic ovals. Credit: NASA   I haven't had a whole lot to say lately, and I'm not sure why.  Maybe I'm still absorbing everything that happened in June.  I had an ultrasound this morning to determine whether there is anything wrong with my breast.  I had noticed a change a couple of months ago and my doctor sent me to have it checked out.  According to the doctor at the radiology clinic, there are no visible anomalies, just denser breast tissue (which happens), I just need to keep an eye on it in case there is a change.  I'll talk to my own doctor when he gets the results next week.  I'm really relieved, but it's one of those things that makes you wonder, deep down in your heart, what life has in store for you.  On the ultrasound screen, everything inside you looks like galaxies and star clusters and vague fuzzy greyness.  And you know that your whole life and self and consciousness depends on all those cells getting it just right, all those little systems working in tandem to keep you, the sum of it all, breathing and pumping and awake and alive.
