         DEAR ANGEL..      you say it or you don't,     but i can see it in your eyes,     some words are not worth saying,     they try to remain in your heart.     i saw it years ago inj your eyes,     what were you trying to say from your smile.      this lovely destiny was like a game for me,     strategy, logic, moves everything it had for me,     this wild game was great to play,     but as per rules, for every wrong move i have to pay.     i am paying for the move i made long ago,     but now i love her even much more.          i have seen the world around     beautiful oceans, just like your eyes.     beautiful flowers, just like your smile.     life goes on miles and miles..     share your kindness, share your smile     life goes on miles amd miles..          life in not a play, it is full of dangers,     take care sweetheart, take care DEAR ANGEL.          --NIL

      MAIN AUR MERI TANHAI (jagjeet singh)  awara hai galiyon mein, main aur meri tanhai. jaye to kaha jaye hum, har mod pe ruswaii, main aur meri tanhai.  yeh phool se chehre hai, haste hue guldaste. koi bhi nahi apna, begane hue sab raste, rahe bhi bhi tamasha hi, main aur meri tanhai.  armaan sulagte hain , seene mein chita jaise. kaatil nazar ati hai,  duniya ki hawa jaise. roti hai mere dil par,  bajti hui shehnai. main aur meri tanhai.  akash ke maathe par,  taaron ka chala gum hai. pehlu mein magar mere , zakhmon ka gulistan hain. aankhon se lahoo tak ka, daaman mein bahar aayi, main aur meri tanhai.  ---js (R)

       MISSING YOU BADLY.  i am lonely here, searching you everywhere, life is where..... you are  i can see only you wherever i see... i can't sleep, i can't stop thinking, i can't live without you,  i am lonely here, searching you everywhere, life is where..... you are  the time seems to stop here, every where is a kind of depression, impatienty is all around, body is alone, soul is full of thirst.  why not your face get away from my eyes for a moment, i can pass days and nights, but life is hard to pass alone, i can't say anything to you even if i want, how can i express my grief to you.  i am lonely here, searching you everywhere, life is where..... you are  whenever there is a slight sound, it felt that you came here, you scented my life ,like a scented rose to me , there was a time when we never got apart,but now the distances in my heart.  i am lonely here, searching you everywhere, life is where..... you are  i remember the old memories when i am lonely, these loneliness speaks to me, i cry hidind from everybody, there been a long time since i smiled,now only tears say my story.  i am lonely here, searching you everywhere, life is where..... you are  i can see only you wherever i see... i can't sleep, i can't stop thinking, i can't live without you.  ---nil

         HAZEL EYES.           close your eyes and     imagine a lake without water,     imagine a tree without leaves,     imagine the moon without stars,     imagine a leaf lying worthless on the ground,     imagine a body withou HEART.          close your eyes again and     imagine me lonely, alone among thousand people.     no-one to share joy and pain,     no-true friends and nothing to gain,     leading a life which is smooth but dark,     trying to forget the memories of morning lark.          close your eyes again     imagine yourself standing on a shore,     under a palm tree, behind you are the mountains, feeling sad and bore.     waiting for someone to appear from the sea,     gives you a blessing , and sets you free.     imagine a flower without its colour,     AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL WITHOUT YOU.          overcome your grief, stand tall and     save the lake to turn barren,     save the tree to turn fossil,     save the moon to turn alone,     save the leaf before anyone steps on it,     save the body before it dies....     ---nil

         LET IT BE ME.    a bird hibernated for a year or so,   her first flight, after her feathers grow.   sparkled from the sunlight were her eyes,   she forgot her mainland and she flies and flies.   created new friends, created new foes,   memories of her mainland finally goes.      forgot her hometown, forgot her trust,   forgot the first book of love, whose love was just.   week gradually passed, eighth day was pleasure,   ninth day was fun, tenth day was leisure.   the eleventh day was a pause in her life,   she had a pool of memories, in which she dive.   she cried for her friends, she cried for her foes ,   she cried for her mainland whose memory never goes.   she cried for her hometown, she cried for her trust ,   she cried for her first love , whose love was just .      she now takes challenges, each day as a goal,    feeling hostile , away from her home.   sparkled from the tears, were her eyes,   she remembers her mainland and she cries and cries,   no true friends and no true foes,   memories of her mainland never goes...      --- nil     you can mail me by clicking-     urlLink mailto:swapnilmail123@rediffmail.com
