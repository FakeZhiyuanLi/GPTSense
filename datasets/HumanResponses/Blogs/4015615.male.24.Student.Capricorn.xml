      So I got this weird headache. Not the kind of headache that's characterized by numb pounding (like my first sexual experience), instead it's sharp, stabbing pain in my temple...like my first bah-mitvah. That was a reach. Sorry.  I tried not to think about it but every 20 minutes or so it became intensely painful and caused me to grit my teeth in anguish and wait for it to pass. It was like this for about a day or so when my lady convinced me to go to the ER. I have little faith in doctors and so actually driving down to the emergency room is a big move for me...right up there with missing my daily shower. So they shot a few quick questions at me, got my insurance and then threw me in an operation room where a girl holding ice over her eye sat waiting with her mother. The nurse curtly told me to change into a smock and lie down on a very uninviting table. When she left all I could think was, "People have died on this table...people have come here, bleeding and screaming and then they died"  ...  I sat on a chair next to the table and read my book. I listened to the girl and her mother talking but the mother was less intelligible than Mayor Menino on muscle relaxants and I couldn't make out a damn word she was saying. Someone finally came in (not a doctor!) and talked to me about my headache and looked in my ears and eyes. This was proceeded by many 'hmmmm''s and 'let me go read about something...' 20 minutes later and 3 more people 'hmmmming', I was sent out the door with a prescription for Motrin. This is why I hate going to the doctor's.  The headache finally went away but it took plenty of Motrin. As I told Hollywood Rick, this was enough Motrin to anesthesize a leg getting ripped off. Even though I was kinda pissed they just gave me some over the counter crap to take, I was really glad when I woke up the next morning feeling better. I couldn't imagine having to get CAT scans and the like.  Off to Fire Island this weekend with the lady and old Tony is going to be there as well. It'll be like The Flintstones meet the Jetsons or Scoopy Doo meets salmonella.  Hope people got to see Kerry speak last night, it was pretty amazing except for the "hair pollution" slip.

      As has been my habit for the past couple weeks, I went out of town for the weekend. This time, I visited my lady's&nbsp;home&nbsp;in Brooklyn, NY&nbsp;since her mom was out of town and it would be a great opportunity to make out with no one to hassle us.   What's more, a Japanese touring company&nbsp;came to Lincoln Center to&nbsp;perform an adaptation of Haruki Murakami's, The Elephant Vanishes. Murakami is my favorite author and non-English word to say besides "fongule" so when my lady surprised me with tickets to this show I surprised her with a hickey the size of Kansas.   The&nbsp;play itself was beyond description; the director who was British, somehow captured Murakami's blend of the mundane with the insane&nbsp;by&nbsp;putting on&nbsp;visually&nbsp;magnificent play. It was all in Japanese with English super-titles but&nbsp;what makes Murakami so great is that his themes can transcend the sometimes superficial East/West culture differences. I didn't get up to wizz once, and those who know me can attest to the impressiveness of this&nbsp;feat.&nbsp;   We finished off the evening with dinner at a fancy downtown eatery and some Die Another Day on cable. All in all it was a lovely day.   That night, however, my lady and I waged another battle of wills in the bed. For weeks I had been kidding her&nbsp;with the inevitable fact that someday, probably someday soon, one of us would fart&nbsp;while asleep&nbsp;and the other would be awake to hear it. Now, regardless of the fact that girls don't flatulate or poop, this situation seemed to cause my lady some concern. I reassured her that with my high fiber, no-nonsense diet that I would, in fact, be the first one to break the olfactory/aural silence. Regardless, we've both been sleeping less and waking up more often lately and that night when I woke at 6 for another wazz she has migrated into a different&nbsp;room in the apartment.   I know a girl who trained her boyfriend to leave the room ANYTIME he had to fart. Even at night. Then again, my father says that the true test of&nbsp;a relationship is subjecting someone to the Dutch Oven after drinking a couple beers. I promise I'll let everyone know when the cease fire is ended.   Lastly,&nbsp;while walking out of my lady's father's apartment I noticed a small wooden scroll type thing nailed on the doorframe. I asked&nbsp;if this was a Jewish doorbell. She&nbsp;scoffed at my&nbsp;Wasp/Wop&nbsp;ignorance and corrected me by saying it was a Mizuzala (sp?). OK, now I love the Chosen People and all but where are these words coming from? I swear they make them up on the spot to confuse us and then laugh about it in their world-financial headquarters 50 miles under the earth's surface.   Keep it comin', sucka!!!

      I've just done 100 pushups. I didn't want to but my friend,  urlLink Tony &nbsp;urged me to do it.&nbsp; What's more, he finally bullied me into starting a blog again. So my atrophied chest and writing skills are&nbsp;now aching as I try to flex them again.   Some background: I'm a 24 year-old grad-student at a small liberal arts  urlLink university &nbsp;in the northeast.&nbsp;I came here one year ago after a failed&nbsp;attempt to integrate into society after college. Now I'm living with a mathematician and a chemist and  trying  (see: failing) to write a thesis.   During one of my first few months at my new university I stepped into the student grocery store to buy some microwaveable food (since I can't cook anything besides&nbsp;the&nbsp;piece of cardboard I pop and lock on...oh shit, oh shit!!!) and while browsing, I overheard the following, "Should I buy meatsauce, or is that like, offensive?" The girl was genuinely asking her friend whether some Prego might be interpreted an insensitive gesture. Now, prior to this I had been a big fan of the offensive humor. I never met a Corky Thatcher joke I didn't like. In the coming year I hope to be able to chronicle for you the in's and out's (I have a girlfriend!!!) of my life at this University.   So that's my pitch: classic fish-out-water story for today's modern paraplegic whore. I hope you'll be able to tune in for more installments.    today's sermon comes from the Book of Jacob: "So fuckin, you want to&nbsp;make the first move on the bitch, here's what you do...just like, fuckin, chill out on the couch or whatever and then when the time is right just take your dick out and  put it in her hand.  She'll know what to do with it, foo. I mean what else is she gonna do?"

      My eyes are melting as I write this. I can't even look at my computer screen for more than a couple seconds and I'm trying hard to just stare at my keyboard. Let me explain: a couple days ago I signed up for eBay to purchase a new game for X-Box. After a quick sign up, I began to bid in a frenzy and within a couple days I had 2 new video games at my doorstep, and one more in the post as we speak.  The games I won were GTA Vice City, Psi Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, and Medal of Honor II (this one doesn't count as I'll explain) and I probably spent $60 for all 3, a damn fine deal. I think that drugs, alcohol, video games and the like are expensive for a reason. Most people (myself included) are not far removed in evolution from the famous experimental monkey who would press a button that delivered stimulation to the pleasure center of his brain so much that he neglected to eat and drink and soon died. So, my wallet and my hypothalamus got together and struck a deal to betray my poor old eyes and here I am, squinting and fighting the urge to go play some more. After 7 or so hours of game playing today I am beginning to consider myself one notch lower on the Darwinian scale. Luckily, grilled cheese and homemade fruit shakes (my new favorite thing) kept me alive.  Vice City is the game that all parents groups can hold up as the example of how ridiculously violent video games have become and no one could argue. Most people have played it, or watched some poor addicted shit like me play, but for the few who haven't had the pleasure of doing a drive-by in a golf-cart I'll try to catch you up. The game is set in 80's Miami and scored with awesome New Wave and Cock Rock tracks through and through. You run around a vast city environment and do anything you want. Run over an old lady? Sure. Have sex with a prostitute in your car? You betcha! What about Ice T's favorite past-time, cop killing? Of course! And delivering pizzas? Yeah that too, but did I mention the prostitutes? Anyway, it's great fun and I have zero arguments for those who would attack me for playing such a morally reprehensible game. I am here as a receptacle for your 24 righteous indignation needs.  I started playing Psi Ops just tonight, I was scared to start it up because I didn't want to be doubly addicted. For me, it was the difference between being a pothead or a complete basehead as Jacob would say, and I've always been careful not to cross that line in my chemical abuse. So I got Barney to try it out first. Alls I can say is, damn...It's a pretty standard run and shoot type of game except that your character is imbued with psychic abilities that let him do things like lift up an enemy, hold him in mid-air and throw him into a wall repeatedly until he gives up. Or, OR....you can (with your mind) pick up a canister of gas, throw it at him and shoot it in as it approaches him. And that's just the beginning! As the game progresses you can take control of bad-guys' minds and make them walk off a building or attack their buddies, or create a wall of fire, and on and on. There is a 300lb. programmer out there somewhere who is due for a big, wet kiss on his balding head.  I fucked up on Medal of Honor and bought a copy that is only compatible with UK X-Box so I can't play it. This might be a good thing because I've lost money on it and it might help to stem my budding abuse.  I know I was supposed to write about Hartford Strippers but I can't think of that right now, I might have a seizure and shit my pants. My eyes are feeling a bit better now and it's only quarter to 11...one more game? I just need one more game....please...just to let me down easy? One more? You fucks! Ahhhhhhhhh!

      I used to have a tendency to spend weekend nights at home or doing something that Christian Coalition would approve of during college. Needless to say this kind of habit was widely disapproved of during "the best years of our lives" by one saucy Italian in particular.  "Why don't you go out? YOU NEVER GO OUT!"  "I dunno, I think I just want to watch Requiem for a Dream again."  "I can't believe you. You know, Rick really wants you to go. He said so."  "He did? Ehhhh, OK, let me get my dancing shoes on."  But somehow, I've been to more parties in one year of grad school than I attended during my entire tenure at Emerson and this summer I've been heading out every weekend to new cities and orifices to have a good time. So, despite what some linguini-sucking, bocce-ball playing, jump-rope-using fuckasses might tell you, I've been more active than a venereal disease at Rutgers lately. But last Friday I decided that, hey, why not stay in old M-town this weekend and relax with the rubes? It's been so long since I've been harassed by drunken red necks and called a "queer-ass". So there it was, a veritable cornucopia of opportunities for entertainment in M-town lying before me like a Jennifer Lopez  urlLink Thanksgiving .  My roommates, the mathematician and the Kenyan chemist suggested we go GALAXY BOWLING (AKA black light bowling, aka the Right-wing conspiracy's brilliant tactic to co-opt Dark Side of the Moon)! The mathematician, Barney, checked the web site for prices and times and found out that the lights go low at 10:30...and so do the prices! 3 hours of bowling for 10 bucks!!! Anyone raised in the burbs can back me up on the sweetness of this deal. However, past experiences have taught me that with glowing balls and Floyd on repeat come legions of pre-driver's license teens.  Growing up in Los Angeles, Bo Jackson and the Raiders imbued me with a "commitment to Excellence" so I wasn't about to let some pock-covered shit with crew-cut pubes beat me to the lanes, I wanted to get there right on time. After some twists and turns through some anonymous nighttime town, we pulled up to T-Bowl.  T-Bowl's exterior serves as an example of what the U.S. might have looked like if the Soviet Union won the cold war. The crumbling outer walls were faded pink and neon green, not unlike the color of Valentine's candy hearts. The parking lot was empty...strange, I thought, maybe the teens are still out back sucking down grain alcohol.  But what the exterior lacked in refinery the inside made up for in (absolutely no) ambiance. I can safely say I've never been so sure that I was gonna have a bad time immediately after walking into a place. Maybe 3 lanes were being used. One was occupied by a couple guidos and their skinny girlfriends who were fiercely and meekly (respectively) tossing their balls down the lane. Then, off in a corner of the place, some kind of family was making the rounds between bowling and playing those claw-prize games which were strangely overrepresented, totaling 5 in all.  Oh, and there was no black lights on. In fact, this bowling alley was more lit up than Dope Jacob on Dope Jacob Day. This wasn't right at all, surely the morbidly obese clerk would remedy this situation post haste!  "Uh, where are the blacklights, the web site said that black light bowling started at 10:30."  "We need to update the web site."  "Could you turn off the lights, I mean there's like no one here."  "No, uh, this is family hour...and it's 10 for 2 hours."  This is when one of the subtle nuances of the craptacularity of the suburbs came into play...if this were the city, we'd be out the door and into the nearest gin joint making fun of that tittied clerk over some libations, but when you drive for 20+ minutes into an area where the only other option for fun would be pissing on brand new Kia's, you got no options.  So bowled we did. The lanes were so greasy that every time you got your beaten-up ball back it would be covered in lube. Big black lubed balls: not hygienic. It also made for shitty bowling, your ball didn't seem to roll as much as it did glide down the lane, and more often than not it went right into the gutter. Moreover, the place was falling apart like a  urlLink Danza  comeback.  Not even entering a wacky handle on the bowling computer could save this night because every time you might be able to laugh at "Kenyan Thunder" you were instantly depressed with an ad for "The Best Birthday Party in the Universe at T-Bowl!!!"  After the guidos had taken out their Zitti aggression and the family in the corner had one enough stuffed animals to fill another teen girl's bed with tragic prizes we were the last ones left. The clerk then began some hardcore bowling in an adjacent lane that caused him to sweat in odd places: his forearm, shoulder, haunch...  Well, I'd had enough, it was time to go back to my world of cocaine, Gucci, and liberal moral relativism. Speaking off, tune in next time for Hartford strippers!!!

      Recently, my mother, a traditional kinda Italian gal, has become more vocal than usual about the possibility of my lady and I tying the knot. Just to be fair, this wasn't a novel topic coming from her. Ever since we've moved to Santa Barbara she's been talking about having a wedding at our house and how exciting it would be. I imagine she began having these thoughts as her 4 years of redesigning of our house were coming to an end and a void suddenly opened up in her creative world. Since then, she's had no problem with petitioning all her friends and family members that are in relationships (of any duration or commitment) to consider our house as a possible location. When family friends visited last summer after not seeing us in probably over 10 years she delighted in offering wedding services to the son of an old friend whom had brought his girlfriend along. The couple, noticeably surprised by the offer smiled coyly until the subject was changed and my mother distracted.  So it didn't come as an immediate surprise when my mother informed me that she thought my lady might be "the one". I told this to Tony and he vowed to refer to my lady as Neo from now on.  When I asked my mother why she might believe this to be so, she just replied, "I dunno, I just have a feeling," which means that she's pooled the information she regularly garners from psychics, astrologers, and hidden messages in Dr. Phil's mustache to come to this conclusion.  But my mother's confidence, despite ever meeting my lady, is worth something. I'm usually the one to plan out the next 10 years with someone. Even though my mom probably loses some bladder control at the thought of having her own  son  getting married at her house, she has always offered words of caution when thinking too far off in the distance.  "I wish I would have dated more before I married your father," is my favorite. Basically my mom is telling me that her marriage is kinda F-ed and I should get out there and spread my seed into a crowd like a shotgun blast.  So, as I prepare to jet my lady off to the West coast for her first meeting with the rents, here's to hoping that my mother won't immediately ask where we want the salsa buffet table--next to the Guatemalan paper guest book or the Rose path photo nook?   A reading from the book of Jacob: Blow is blow.
