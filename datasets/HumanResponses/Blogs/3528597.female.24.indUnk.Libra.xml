      Thesis defense in t minus 2 days and counting.  For the past two days I have been feeling terribly stressed.  Being completely psychosomatic I haven't been thinking stressed thoughts or worrying, but I have a knot in the pit of my stomach.  My bodies way of saying, "You should be stressed!"  I had misattributed* it to being nervous about meeting old friends.  They were super cool (and by using that phrase I reveal myself to NOT be super cool).  And I still feel weird today, so it must be the thesis stuff.  This project will, eventually, drive me crazier.  On a happy note, I did go out to dinner with two old friends I had in elementary school.  It was neat to see that, while not the 13 year olds I said good bye to 11 years ago when I was shipped off to Catholic school, on a very fundamental level they were still very much the same.  Dinner was nice.  I came home early.  Gabe would be proud, I did not stay out late drinking and dancing at the black cat.  I came home so I could finish my work.  Next time I will not be so restrained.  When did I get responsible?   * This appears to be spelled incorrectly.  Spell check wanted to replace it with masturbated. (giggle) ** Also does anyone else think it is weird that "blog" comes up as misspelled on the blog spell check?

      I have decided that the blog is the perfect, time consuming, excuse I need to avoid putting together my thesis defense.  If you are heather (my thesis adviser) and reading this, be assured I have been working very hard. I just can't slave *all* day.  I was hoping to put a link to my webshots on the main blog thing, not just in a post.  But I can't figure it out right now, though honestly I didn't look very hard.  So I have will put the link here:   urlLink pictures     I don't know if that worked, but there is html stuff floating around.  I am looking to get more pictures up.  One of my projects for this month, aside from my thesis, was to make albums of all the photos I have neglected for the past year.  Another project was to get all crafty and make marriage party invites/announcements.  Both of these tasks involve high quality printing.  However, the printer here is about 8 years old and barely functioning.  So I am kinda lost.  I will have to do albums on the web and print them off later.  Poo.  Must...Work...Must...Stop...Procrastinating...

      Thanks to the blog of Anna I have found two old friends from elementary school.  As it turns out, there is a whole little online world full of people I would never have bumped into in real life.  It is just now that I realize how backwards I had been living for the past few years.  Absolute craziness.    As an update for those of you who don't already know.  I am almost done with my Masters in Clinical Psych from Penn State.  I was working as a therapist at a community mental health center and receiving training while going to school until I came home (DC area home) in May.  I now have a background in HIV prevention (my research area) and acute mental health disorders (my clinical area).  Psychosis and sex.  How can you go wrong?  Once I finish my thesis, which keeps getting delayed, I will move north.  As I write my boyfriend is en route to Alaska with all of my stuff.  He just graduated from Penn State law school and found a great job in Alaska (where he is originally from) and I am moving with him.  We will be getting married in July (at the courthouse, not a wedding) after I get up there.  I will need to find a job and such.  I hear the winter in Alaska makes people crazy, so work will be plentiful, and I will make connections to get meds if the winter drives me nuts as well.    For those of you who have been following the saga... The pre defense defense is on Monday.  The room has been selected.  The paper has been compiled.  The committee has been notified.  If everything goes according to plan I will have the official defense scheduled by the end of the month.

      I have officially begun my journey into the world of blog.  I ended up here by complete accident while searching for old friends on the web and avoiding thesis work.  However, it seems as good a time as any to start posting the day to day randomness of my life for the world to read.

      So I had a super sucky stay at a super sucky hotel followed by a not so hot thesis defense.  I almost thought I wouldn't have to go back and do it again.  However, the puppeteer of the Universe hates me and has been trying to make this project drag on for as long as humanely possible.  Now the official count is...  price of new suit for defense - $ 140  price of hotel room - $ 70 price of printing millions of copies of the same paper - $15 dollars  having to go back and do it all over again in two weeks at the request of protocol obsessed academicians  priceless.

      How is it that, when I first started this blog I thought I had many things to write about.  However, now that I have been traveling around the country, staying in luxurious hotels, and having an absolutely wonderful time, all I can write about is my BWI shuttle problem.  Along with my new car I will also ponder this.    Things to ponder...  -My feelings on SUVs.  -Why I don't share more interesting stories on the blog. -The completely random nature of my comma use.   -Why my grandmother keeps inviting people to my after wedding party, who(m?) (whatever) I have never met before, and then thinks  I  will be offended when other members of our family tell her it isn't appropriate.   -Why my grandmother is inviting anyone to my party in the first place. -Why America is the only place in the world that deems shorts are appropriate attire. -What it is about shorts that makes them so offensive to me in the first place. -All the reasons, one month ago, I thought it was a good idea to send every one of my bikinis to Alaska and bring my super goretex rain gear to Virginia. -The fact that Bed Bath and Beyond creates registries for commitment ceremonies in addition to weddings.  Cool. -If it would be appropriate to purchase a dinner set of japanese plates and make my parents bring them up to me in Alaska. -Do I really think any of my friends would buy me an 80 dollar sheet? ---To be continued when I have more time to ponder

      Back from New Orleans.  Once again the Big Easy did me in.  However, this time it wasn't the hurricanes.  Instead it was the 90 some degree weather and the remmains of a stomach bug from last weekend.  I made it to three dinners, a music in the park, an IMAX showing of Harry Potter, and the botanical gardens.  I missed Marsha Ball at the House of Blues, and shopping on Magazine St.  I will just have to go back later...either when it is cooler or I become smart enough to avoid touring the botanical gardens at noon on a day that could fry small children in cars.    Today I did have quite the adventure at the airport.  When I arrived to catch the plane to New Orleans I found a parking spot right next to the shuttle pickup as the shuttle to BWI was approaching.  I flew through e-ticket check in and had a new security line opened up for me when I was stuck behind a very large tour group.  The total time from my car to my gate was about 20 minutes or so.  I was then asked to fill out a marketing survey for the airports service from parking to the gate.  Granted, they got flying reviews.  "How long did you wait for security?"  "I didn't."  "How long did you wait for the shuttle?"  "I didn't."    Today, however, when I got off the plane (mind you I was sick and dizzy and hurt) I found my bag and promptly got on the wrong shuttle.  At the AMTRAK station the driver realized I was lost and tried to help me figure out which shuttle I should get on when we returned to the terminal.  He asked "Long term parking A or B?"  "There is more than one lot?" I replied.  He sighed and went back to driving.  He let me off at the terminal.  I got off, went back to a bus stop, only to realize I didn't have my bags.  So I found security, who found me a transportation person, who found me a courtesy phone, whose operator told me to find the shuttle and retrieve my bags.  Duh.  I finally found my driver who was not as helpful this time, found my bags, and found a bus to long term lot A.  I found my car and drove the hour home.    What an adventure!   Now  I want the marketing lady from BWI to ask me about my trip.  While I am quite aware this whole mix up was 100% my fault, I would enjoy blaming it on the airport.     I think Gabe is out negotiating for my new car today.  I hope it ends up being something lovely.  I may be getting a Subaru sedan instead of an SUV.  I don't know if that makes me happy because I associate SUVs with middle aged conservative white guys, or unhappy because I will soon be living in the one place on the planet where an SUV could be considered sensible.  I will ponder that tonight.

      Today I had lunch with my grandmother.  Gigi has a very interesting view of the world.  Every time we go out and talk I am always amazed at the ideas and misperceptions she has about me.  For example, today we were talking about Gabe and I buying a house.  Now, for those of you who don't know, I am completely employable and looking towards a fulfilling career in the field of mental health and addictions counseling.  That is why I spent 6 years in the higher education system.  That is why I am in debt for tens of thousands of dollars.  However, today she asserted that I must be looking forward to making Gabe sandwiches for work and doing laundry and staying at home with the new puppy and keeping house.  I protested slightly and she corrected me.  Apparently, I  love  cooking for Gabe and I  love  doing laundry and I  love  staying home.  Won't I just make him so happy!  Now, don't get me wrong.  I actually do enjoy cooking and will probably end up doing the laundry.  For some reason Gabe hates laundry.  The easiest way to get the bathroom cleaned was to declare it "laundry day" and tell him I would fold clothes if he would scrub something else.  But that isn't the point.    The point is I have no idea how she got the notion I was planning on being a housewife.  Before this she declared I would hate going to visit my friends in Japan (wrong).  I would love for her to bring _____ (insert random person) to my wedding (wrong).  I love ham (I am a vegetarian and have been for YEARS).  I want to keep my car (It is listed in the paper for sale).  I think she secretly snoops around to find things out about me and then insists I believe/do/think/enjoy/want the opposite just to drive me nuts.   By the way if anyone wants a 97 Saturn coupe, email me.  I have one to sell for cheap.  Today I ponder...The intentions of my grandmother and the possiblity my thesis may be done in less than a week.

      I have arrived in Japan and am exploring Otsu by myself for a little while.  I have discovered a couple things in the few hours since I have been here.  1.  Everyone and everything is very tiny.  The space bar on this keyboard measures less than 2" wide.  The counters in Jen's apartment are lower than my hip.  I hit my head on the bedroom light fixture three times yesterday.  Everything is mini.  In turn I feel like a huge bumbling sweaty oaf in comparison.  Not the place to come to boost one's self esteem.  2.  The Japanese love English words.  There was a sign outside this internet cafe that said *internet*.  Yet, there was not a single person in the place that knew what "internet" meant and I had to resort to miming using a keyboard to convey my need for a computer.  Today I am going to the local department store to try and purchase fun Japanese things.  Maybe some yam ice cream or a little seaweed flavored ramen or a nice salad with little dried fish instead of croutons.  So very interesting.

      I PASSED.  COMPLETELY PASSED.  I turned in my final, and this means FINAL, thesis project today.  On the 14th of August I will officially have a Masters of Arts in Applied Clinical Psychology, with a concentration in Health psychology.  FINALLY!!!!!  On a completely unrelated note...  (Bearing in mind that my dogs name is Peanuts, and that my grandmother is older and may not pronounce words as well as the rest of us....)  I have an activity for all of you.  First, stand up and retrieve a piece of bread from your kitchen.  Seriously.  If you are at work, find something to eat that is slightly squishy.  GO. GET BREAD!  Now.  Take the piece of bread and eat it, chewing it up into a gooey paste in your mouth.  Don't swallow.  When the bread is properly masticated say the following three times fast..  "Peanuts, Peanuts, Peanuts"  If you are in an office space, or have a roommate, say it loudly to get the full effect...  Now say "Peanuts loves to roll in dead fish"  Then  "Your parents must get so mad when peanuts rowdy and chases the cats around the house"  Then  "I just love Peanut so much!  She is so wrinkly!"  Then  "Peanuts isn't stinky!  You should wash peanuts off more often"  That was my dinner conversation with Gig a couple nights ago.  I could have died.  When my thesis advisor asked me the name of my dog and, after I told her, exclaimed, "You named your dog Penis?!?" I decided it was time to change the name.    And I thought "Peanut" was adorable.  Sigh.

      So I have finished my time in Japan and moved to Alaska.&nbsp; If anyone out there has the opportunity to travel to Japan I highly recommend it.&nbsp; It was a wonderful experience.&nbsp; Once I have my own computer up and running I will post some pictures and commentary.&nbsp; It was a trip filled with memorable, exciting, and beautiful experiences.&nbsp; I spent one night lounging in a wooden tub of warm water in a rooftop garden at a Japanese bath and&nbsp;watching fireworks go off across a lake to signify the opening the the midsummer festival when two stars cross in the sky.&nbsp; Just amazing.  &nbsp;  I am now at a computer in Alaska.&nbsp; For the past week I have been learning how to function in my new home.&nbsp; I am almost proficient at navigating the roads and not completely offending people with my pushy east coast attitude.&nbsp; If life moved any slower up here, I would be going backwards.&nbsp; I think I will love it!  &nbsp;  The house shopping has been going slowly, of course.&nbsp; We have found a few places that fit our needs, but were already sold.&nbsp; We have found another place that is still being built that is just the right size on just the right amount of land.&nbsp; We figure if we try and bid on it when it is still just a frame we may have a chance of snapping it up.&nbsp; Today we go out looking at houses again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      For the past two weeks I have been devoted fully to the hunt for a nice house.&nbsp; A house close to town with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a decent sized yard.&nbsp; Until this morning we had been looking at houses in the 160-180 range.&nbsp; Assuming that we could find something suitable, but not glamorous for that price.&nbsp; This is Alaska for the love of Christ.&nbsp; A state larger than Texas with fewer residents than the Dallas/Fort Worth area.&nbsp; There should be plenty of cheap land, right?   NO!&nbsp; WRONG!&nbsp; No land for you!   We saw cute little houses next door to apartment complexes with missing windows and cars junked in the front yard.&nbsp; We saw houses in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw houses with yards that would require hauling in tons (literally)&nbsp;of top soil to cover the gravel yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw fix'r up houses that I could pull the siding off of with my fingernail.&nbsp; The final straw came when we saw a perfect house, small but made for a couple.&nbsp; Large master bed and bath small side rooms.&nbsp; Nice lot, close to town...but when we went in the garage there was a giant tank of water.&nbsp; Apparently when&nbsp;a well has a low flow a "bladder" is used to collect water and store it until it is needed.&nbsp; The realtor told us not to worry, bladders had to be installed if the output of the well was lower than 3 gallons per minute.&nbsp; If it was a solid 2-3 gallons per minute and the well wasn't deep, it wouldn't be an issue.&nbsp; We checked the paperwork.&nbsp; The output was 3/4 gallons per minute and the well was 200 ft deeper than standard.&nbsp; The house could have run out of water .&nbsp;  The only house in our price range we liked  didn't have water. &nbsp;   We went home and rethought our plans and upped our housing allowance by 20,000 bucks.&nbsp; This morning we found the perfect house.&nbsp; Large lot.&nbsp; Awesome bedrooms.&nbsp; Giant kitchen with oversized side-by-side fridge.&nbsp; Mud room.&nbsp; Deck.&nbsp; I can not reveal the location of this house because it would completely jinx it.&nbsp; When our bid is accepted and our earnest money taken, I will put up tons of pictures.&nbsp; I am in charge of the financing as I understand money and Gabe is going to draw up our bid.&nbsp; The next step is shopping for furniture, appliances, and shoes.&nbsp; I firmly believe every house needs a few new pairs of shoes.&nbsp;   Wish us luck.
