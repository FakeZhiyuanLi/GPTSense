      Reading autobiographies is one of my favorite things to do. (In fact, I have a story in the works centered on the time in my life when I happened to be reading Malcolm X's, but that's for another time.) I aspire to write and be paid for doing so, and Thoreau said that he required of every writer a brief account of his or her own life. I've sat down many times looking to start at the absolute beginning of my life, birth in Syosset, New York, but the details are sort of not there. There's nothing there, as a matter of fact. I don't remember a single thing about my early life. For all I know, I could have been born in a German whorehouse and shipped off to the States when I was seven just in time for my first memory, a birthday party at Kids Kingdom.  So this time, instead of trying to start at the beginning of my life, I'm going to start at the beginning of high school. It's all an immediate memory for me, since it just ended about three months ago, and some fairly interesting stuff happened over those six years (I attended the same school from seventh through twelfth grade, so it's six). Of course, I don't plan to do this all in one entry. I'll probably take about nine or ten, depending on the way I choose to do it. The plan is for it to chronicle the last six years of my life. When I started this post, the plan was for me to begin the high school stories here, but now I think I'll let this become sort of a precursor to the actual thing.  When it comes, I won't warn you or anything. Be ready.

      I'm getting comfortable here.  I write a lot, and most of it is garbage. But on occasion, I'll look back at my (literally) twenty notebooks-full of work and just randomly select something and read it. On even less frequent occasion, I like what I find. Here's a poem that I must have written in early 2002, tenth grade. In the notebook it was entitled Angel, but here, we'll call it nothing. This is also my only decent work on Poetry.com. Seriously, look for yourself. Everything else reads like a six-year-old's homework. Just go to Poetry.com and search for Last Name: Delaney, First Name: Mike Francis. Here's the poem.  you are the angel whose wings I fly upon each day  You are the foundation that supports my nightly slumber.  your lips bring smiles to my face and your eyes bring tears to mine  Earth is turned back to recover past pain and skin is opened, pouring red.  to show thickness of committment   I will watch you  Because of you the rain fell upwards.  beaches of green compete with eyes full of remorse and your music is kept with the slightest of guilt in my functionless except for you brain  And you drowned in it.

       Newly begun Tuesday. The music of the moment is Doughty’s Rockity Roll. Yesterday (from whence I still haven’t slept) was a good day, and the un-hectic nature of the days leading up to my departure is soothing. Colin woke me up around 11 AM, but he only looked blurry and said words. I don’t know which ones. I ended up waking a few hours later, but he had gone and so had any sign of life in the house. I wandered around until I encountered some people like Aunt Andi and such, but I felt some recollection of voices emanating from the living room when Colin had first woken me up. I suppose I wanted the voices and the life and the activity back, having lost the opportunity to participate.    I called Colin, and he eventually told me he had gone to Kim’s parents’ home for some time, ours being desolate, and would be back later on. He would be, but there was something in between. I had an appointment with the chiropractor at 4:30, so I got my keys, phone, and wallet, and moved off. I merged onto Nicholls Road just fine, but when it came time to make the left onto 347, traffic had suddenly become very thick, and I decided not to cut someone off. I went past 347, being early anyway, and took a long drive around Stony Brook. When it came time to go back, I did, and after the successful drive (re: without getting lost), I had my appointment and scheduled another for Wednesday the twenty-fifth, the day before I leave. Might not be able to make that one, needing, among other things: a haircut, two books from my new list that I don’t own, a shave, a shower, clothes, and time to pack. Hectic, I know.    Currently reading The Great Gatsby, and I’ll be putting whatever I’m reading in this regularly. I’ll also jot some poetry and lyrics myself and post them up. Whatever I’m feeling like at the time.    College remains two days away as I type, but I guess it’s hourly creeping up. My roommate, Roman, seems like a nice guy and we should get along well. This is a time when I as a young man have gotten advice—some sought out and some not—from every possible source. Colin maintains that it’s an easy, fun experience, TupacBoard friends insist that I concentrate on my GPA, still others offer good advice with proper questioning, but I haven’t quite thought of the questions. That’s really the big idea: I don’t know what to ask because I have no idea what I’m starting in a few days. It could be good or it could be bad, and I haven’t the slightest clue whether it will even lean to either side.    And so for today: I have a dentist appointment at 1:00. Michael J. Gulotta, my dentist, is a good guy. When he saw my name in handwriting, though, he mistakenly saw Michael J. Delaney, which was a bond. “Michael J’s are the best, aren’t they?” I couldn’t let the guy down, of course, so I nodded and told him that we were. During that visit he told me I had three cavities, those being the reason for the visit today. I’ll be numb next time I write.

      I mentioned that I'd be posting whatever poetry or lyrics or thoughts I had on my mind in here, so here's the first batch.   calm man blowing into the night  as the rain raged on he became something like a photograph  it becomes apparent the man is not a man the death begins its quest to  belittle all that is!

      Let me put this all down on paper for you.  It's Saturday night. I'm alone in my room, my dad and my cousin Denis are sitting in the living room watching the Jets/Colts preseason game (which the Jets won, and if preseason meant anything I'd be really happy about--in any event, Pennington looked great), Aly's at home with apparently no chance of making it out to see me, and Kara is at work, set to sleep at a friend's house. (She's house-sitting.) It's about 10:30.  The idea strikes me.  "I liked The Exorcist. I really loved it. Come to think of it, it's one of my all-time favorite movies. I haven't seen the second one, but The Exorcist III was also a very decent movie in its own right. I should round up as many people as I can and take a trip out to Island 16 and see Exorcist: The Beginning. Tonight!"  Well, that was probably one of the worst ideas I've ever had. And I've had some bad ones.  So I told Denis about the idea, and he was in. Kara took some convincing. Then, Aly surprised me by calling and saying that she'd be able to come out after all. And so around 12:20, the four of us sat in the darkened-green chairs at Island 16. As soon as I took my seat, I noticed that I was in the one spot in the entire theater that was actually positioned so that the seat in front of it is higher, thus partly blocking the view of your average 5'9" white male. I'd say something like, "I wish my entire view was blocked," but that'd be trite and unfunny.  Now, there are movies that aren't good. There are cheap gross-out flicks. And there are movies that fall so impossibly short of their goals that they end up as jokes instead of actual films. Exorcist: The Beginning is all three. Not to mention probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen such hits as: Jaws: The Revenge, 28 Days Later, Mrs. Doubtfire, and more! First off, it's the most unnecessary, binding-in-your-seat gore-fest I've ever encountered. Secondly, the acting, script, and all the other things-that-have-to-be-good-if-a-movie-is-to-be-in-and-of-itself-good were horrible.  Roughly an hour into the film, the four of us decided that the forty dollar total we had spent on the tickets was better spent on nothing than on actually watching the entire thing, so we left.  And that's it. Don't see the movie.
