       Goodnight my love...   Yeah, that was Keith's away message last night. We talked a lot online last night, but nothing of real importance... he was thinking about things yesterday but when I asked him he said he didn't have any major revelations and he needed more time... It was so good to read that away message though. It made me all happy and fuzzy. That kid in *general* makes me all happy and fuzzy. I hope this lasts... I'm already getting nervous that he'll lose interest again. He's playing my SG for a song at the TSS show on July 9, and he'll have to play it before that to make sure it'll work and stuff, so I know I'll see him but still... I have thet doubtful feeling and I really hate it.

      Wow... after I wrote my last entry things got intense. Josh called my cell and I called him back and ended up bawling on the phone... which I feel bad about, but I couldn't really hold it back. Keith got online and didn't bother to IM me, so I put up an away message that was simply a sad face. He IMed me almost immediately asking what was wrong. After a little beating around the bush, I said that I just didn't feel good enough for anyone. So he decides to rattle off a list of how wonderful I am. The full list is: "You love good music, Rock the guitar, Piss Dean off, Write, Stare at stars, Dreamy, Intense, Pissed, Hot Damn!, Cookie Dough, Box, You got it all but it's just too hot to handle." Now at the time it pissed me off incredibly because I was thinking  Yeah, but I still wasn't good enough for you, was I?  So I said it. He came back with yes I am, and that he does still like me a lot, which actually came as a huge surprise. Apparently he sees me as confusing as well, and wasn't sure of what I wanted as well as what he wanted. We didn't really talk that much more in depth about things, but I think it was good that we both updated each other on our feelings I guess... Josh was on the phone the entire time and made things so much easier because he kept saying what an idiot and a douche Keith was, and how he wanted to stab him and bludgeon him with a bat. It made me feel so much better, thanks bunches Josh, it meant a lot to me! Keith also said his friends are growing sick of hearing how lonely he is, though I'm not all too sure of how valid a complaint that is, when it's pretty much his own damn fault he's lonely. I'm here, I've always been here, and I'll always be here for him. So it's his fault he's lonely. He says he's not sure what he wants, but I think that's mostly BS. He's scared. He even admitted it himself that maybe that's what it was since him and his ex were together so long and the breakup was hard on him. It's not that he's not over her, I think he's just scared of getting close to someone again. Which is just frustrating and confusing. I hope this thing works out someway, sometime soon.

      TSS show tonight... ended up being allowed to use the car, so me and Jesse went out to Forward Hall. Bah. I don't even know... Keith frustrates me sooo much! Since Monday, he's acted so nice and all excited to talk to me, and tonight he acted like he was just putting in the requisite time talking to me so he wouldn't be rude. It's so frustrating. A few things he did was his way of flirting, other times it was just like he was forcing himself to talk to me. One time he walks by without looking at me, the next minute I see him staring at me from where he's standing with his friends. I just don't know! Maybe he thought Jesse was more than my friend, or I don't even know... maybe I had wishful thinking and he's not interested in me again. *extreme sad face* Maybe I'm just plain too UGLY AND BORING AND JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH! I don't even fucking know, apparently that's what it is.

      Went down to Cal U with Dean today and it was a disaster. Enough said. TSS show tomorrow... hopefully I'm going. I'm really excited to see Keith, I probably shouldn't be, but I am. I have so many emotions running through me about that kid. Hope, doubt, happiness, sadness...   I feel like there's a chance, but at the same time I feel like I'm still not good enough for him. I feel like I'm not good enough for *anyone*. It's so frustrating. Kate said last night at the show she saw a couple guys that she wanted to talk to for me, but I'm so completely consumed with Keith she didn't bother. And I can see her point. I can like other guys, and be interested in other guys, but emotionally I'm still tied to Keith for some God only knows why reason. That kid frustrates me to no end.   And your taste still lingers on my lips Like I just placed them upon yours And I starve I starve for you!

      More with the random lyrics, that was from "Televators" from the Mars Volta. I didn't get to talk to Keith much today, he got online at like 2 in the morning, IMed me saying "Hi" like 4 times, got off, said "hi" two more times, got off... lol I'm pretty sure his AIM was fucked up where you hit Enter and it looks like it doesn't send but it does... because he got online again, IMed me, and said "hi" and then "Just saying goodnite, bye" so I don't know if his AIM was still fucked and he was just giving up, or if it was late and he wanted to go sleepy. But either way, I thought it was sweet that he was trying to figure out his AIM for so long just to be able to say goodnight...   Despite that, I still feel like I'm walking on glass around him... I feel that at any given moment he's just gonna randomly lose interest, like, at the snap of a finger. I know that technically you can't stop liking someone you like that much in the matter of one day but... still, just judging from the past... I'm scared. I wish tomorrow didn't exist, and we could go straight to Thursday, where I can hang out with him all day and then the next day will be Friday, the show.  But to discuss something that's NOT Keith in this journal, (shocker I know), I'm talking to Amy right now and I feel really bad. She's having problems with Matt and I'm really trying to try and make her feel better and give her some decent advice. Seems like what I did with Caro the other night. I can't STAND to see my friends sad, especially when guys make them feel badly about themselves. No guy is worth compromising your feeling of self-worth. I know, I know... I should talk, right? It seems like I can give other people advice, and convince them that they're not worthless and stuff, and really mean it, but I can't make myself believe it about *me*. Oh well... I'm outies. xoxo.

      Alright, this entry is a response to one Kate wrote in hers. I suppose if she wrote an entry to explain what was going through her head, so will I. I can understand why you dislike Keith, hell, if I were you I'd hate him too. I completely understand why you hate him like you do, and to be honest, you probably have a right to. That's not what pissed me off last night. I started getting mad when online you said that your mom read this. That just kind of ticked me off because I don't think that it's really her place to discuss things I write in her with you. At the time, you're the only one who had the link to this site, for a reason. Now the only other person is Caroline. So I said I had to go, and then you called me. Whenever you talk about Keith, I feel like you're cornering me in. Like, you'll ask if we talked about dating, and if I say yes, you'll start asking all these questions about if he really wants to, and when, and all this stuff. Maybe I shouldn't, but when you talk like that, I feel boxed in and when I feel boxed in I get defensive and just shut down all together to the person I'm talking to. And then I said I had to go, and you kept trying to call me, and that pissed me off because you knew I didn't feel like talking.  And don't even try to say I didn't answer because I was waiting for Keith, that has nothing to do with it. But the thing that pissed me off more than anything was I looked in your profile and it said "I know something you don't know. Bitch." I mean WTF... Kate, I just don't know how long I can keep fighting like this. I know you don't want to see me hurt again, but I think as my friend, above everything else you should  respect my decision . And if he hurts me again, worry not, I won't be calling you to talk about it. So don't worry about that. Above all, it's my decision, I'm sorry, that's just the type of person I am to forgive people and whatnot. Maybe you've never felt the way Keith can make me feel. I don't know. All I'm saying is, respect my decision, and don't critisize me for it.

      Random Brand New lyric for ya... I'm not all too sure of what to make of today. It was somewhat intense. I came home from work and Keith had left me two voicemails, which made me smile. He said he'd call me back later, but he never did. So around 2 I was bummed, slapped an away message up, and sat on my roof. I looked in and saw that Keith IMed me so I came back inside to chat with him. He seemed a little miffed at first that he had called me twice but then I explained I had work and it was all good. At one point he said he had been thinking a lot, and I think he wanted me to ask about what, but I knew that he had been thinking about "us" and I didn't want to pry, so I just kind of said thinking was good. Then he said he wondered what would ever happen to us, and I said I wondered too. Five minutes later he said he was sleepy and he was going to bed, so we never got to chat on the phone but it was ok, I guess. Maybe he'll call me tomorrow, maybe I'll call him, who knows... I feel like I'm on pins and needles, just waiting for things to change. I hope things go smoothly in the next three days, because once we hang out Thursday and Friday I think it'll be good... I hope. And also, I'm so so upset about Caroline. *sad face* She's so upset over the guy she likes/hates and it really upsets me. Usually when my friends have guy problems it doesn't affect me because it happens to everyone, but Caroline is so smart and so talented and the guy is just so.... ugh. I can't stand it! I just need to survive until Thursday... then all will be good...

      Still frustrated. Keith didn't get online tonight. I haven't really talked to him since like... Tuesday, and I miss him and want to talk to him. But at the same time I'm thinking that whatever feelings he has for me are probably gone now... if he's not making the effort to even get online to talk to me, I'm guessing they've fizzled out... so tonight  I keep thinking along the lines of "Well... I'll see him next Friday and then he'll be interested again," but at the same time I'm like wait a minute... it shouldn't *be* like that. The whole thing between me and him is just so wrong and I don't think it'll ever be right again... I don't know, it could be my paranoid feelings, but I'm thinking it's not. On one hand, I truly believe that if he would get his head on straight and make an effort and stop being scared, we could really be something. I mean... after having off and on feelings since like November... that has to mean something. But on the other hand... his head ISN'T on straight, and I DON'T see him making an effort, and he IS scared. So that completely negates my theory of anything working out. When I talk to that kid or hang out with him, I feel like I have really strong feelings, but at times like this I just feel like the only reason I have those feelings is because I have no one else... It's just a big fucking circle of frustrating, because it's like I like Keith because I don't have anyone else... but as Kate pointed out, it may not be fair to get involved with someone else because of my pattern of going back to Keith, therefore I have no one and like Keith. *sad face* It's so frustrating and I'm so lonely...

      Holy fucking shit I don't remember being this pissed off in a really fucking long time. First, Tuesday night Keith says maybe he wants to do something Wednesday. So I say I'll call off work if he wants to, and he says he'll let me know the next day. Then he had to make a phone call but maybe he'd be back online. Never gets back online, and never fucking calls or anything the next day. So he doesn't get online last night so not only did he not let me know what was going on, but I didn't even get to talk to the kid. He gets online tonight, we talk for like two minutes, he says he'll be right back, and here it is, fucking 2 and a fucking half hours later, and he never got back online. Wow, I'm glad to see I'm so important to him. I mean Jesus Christ I'm not asking for a lot, just maybe a little fucking attention and um, maybe for him to fucking talk to me once in a fucking while but apparently in the last three days that's just been too fucking difficult for him. But you know, maybe that's what he does to girls he "still likes a lot." Bull fucking shit. All he wants to know is that some girl likes him, and hey, that's all he fucking needs. Gets his ego boosted up and he's good to go for another fucking two months until he gets lonely and needs someone to boost him up again. Why the hell do I even bother with that fucking kid. Someone please tell me because I don't even fucking know. Is he attractive? Not really. Treat me well? Um, not so fucking much. Extremely cool? Negatory. Please someone tell me my fucking logic in why I waste so much fucking time and fucking energy into thinking about that fucking kid. Oh, I know why. Probably because I can't get anyone else. I'll never meet anyone else and I'll probably be alone forever. And no I'm not exaggerating. Call me up in 20 years and I'll still be fucking alone and fucking emo. Guranteed. I don't really give a flying fuck that Josh thinks that's ridiculous because obvious-fucking-ly it's the truth. All I'm fucking good for is to makeout with and talk to once in a while. That's all I've ever gotten. All if Keith thinks I'm so goddamn fucking awesome, then why the hell has he been putting such a fucking spectacular effort into not caring about me at all, and not wanting to hang out at fucking all, because he only suggests it when he has nothing going on, and even fucking then he has to wait until the last fucking minute until something better comes up, and even fucking then he can't have the goddamn fucking courtesy of at least calling or LEAVING AN IM MESSAGE saying he can't hang out. I mean for fuck's sake is it really that fucking hard? Apparently I'm just not worth the fucking trouble. Awesome my ass. I'm just fucking worthless.
