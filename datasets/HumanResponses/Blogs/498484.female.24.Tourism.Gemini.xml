      Back to work....After DMB....Same ole same ole. Said goodbye to Dave, Lori, and ? aka my future niece or nephew.  They are so cute together, I wish someday I could be that cute with someone.  (SHH don't tell anyone I thought that..lol...yall know my stance on marriage)  They are so happy and I love them both so much.  Its nice having family around.  So anyway...You might be thinking....DMB concert is over and now what will Amie do with her next 365 days.  Well let me tell you.  I'm going to go check out Tim McGraw!  He is sexy and can sing really awesome.  Cowboy hat and some tight jeans, just makes the lil country WV gal come out ;-)  Its rare I know, I know.  Ok...I'll admit it now.  I have turned into a girlie girl.  STOP...I know its sad...But I've changed so much since college yall.  I guess I've finally started to find out who I am. Its fun :-)  I still have some of my old vices bugging me, but it's time for me to stop the stupid shit.  DMB has put a shitty lil grin on my face for over 48+ hours.  Just think of how bad I'm going to get watching Tim McGraw.  Then later Josh Groban.  Its a fun summer.  One of the best of my life.

      Ok...So maybe I won't give out details on my rage.  Its all gone now anyway!  I got to see Dave Matthews Band 2 nights in a row up in Pittsburgh.  IT KICKED ASS!!!  The first night we got company tickets at the last minute.  God bless Brent!  I gave away my lawn seats.  We were 13 rows back!  I saw everything!!  VIP parking and the VIP Bar.  In the middle of the concert I was screaming and holding up my beer, he looked RIGHT AT ME!  It so rocked.  The 2nd night we were in section 7.  Pretty nice seats again.  I took my brother for his birthday.  The seating was better the first night, but the music...Damn...He tore up the stage the 2nd night.  Next year I will be at both concerts again!

      I am a ball of rage.  Complete anger and hate.  I'm going to explode soon.  I'm so pissed off I'm not thinking clearly.  Details will come later...

      I'm becoming a depressive alcoholic again. This must stop. NOW!  I drank two bottles of wine and 2 beers.  Drove home like the stupid ass I am.  I'm so lonely here.  I miss all of my friends.  Why can't I ever just find a good group of people to hang out with?  People who can have fun without alcohol or drugs.  Is it this generation all together or just the people I find.  I don't understand.  I miss movie nights, going to Denny's for fun, playing euchre, and just hanging out.  Why does it seem that nobody wants to do these things anymore?

      Apparently I'm going through one of my I NEED TO GET OUT OF TOWN! phases.  It usually hits about once a week.  I just need to remind myself that instead of saving money to move, I bought cute shoes and lots of beer. I'm really going to try to cut back my spending this time.  Its gotten a bit ridiculous.    For some reason I have been listening to country music.  Its very mellow and laid back.  After working all day its kinda nice.  The only downfall is that it makes me want a beer.

      Ok.  So, I have decided to try the Blog thing again.  Its been over a year and a half.  Life works in strange ways.  I'm still in the Wheeling area.  Most of my friends have gone.  All I do is work and work and work.  I found the man I would marry.  Unfortunately he is gay, very gay.  So I'm trapped in this cycle.  Is it worth it to be 24 and a supervisor at a hotel in Wheeling, just to get experience?  Or rather should I move to the Carolinas and hope for the best.  I've gotten every job I have applied for.  I'm at a crossroad.  To stay in Wheeling and get the management experience or say screw it, I'm 24 its time to move away.  If I had a partner in crime to run away with I would.    I know, its a usual posting from me.  I ramble.  Deal with it.
