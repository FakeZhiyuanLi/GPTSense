      i just finished with a week of softball camp. ugh. thank god christine was there, or i definitely would have quit. sweating in the hot sun for 7 hours while you get taught how to "catch and trap" is not my idea of fun. i dont care how much i love softball...how many times can you tell a person "not to create angles in baserunning"? oh well...christine is so freaking awesome and i had so much fun with her!!! haha we got in trouble sooo much for talking and not paying attention...go figure!! anyways...  i just feel so tired...i dont know why. ive just been thinking about some pretty important stuff for a while now. have yall ever done that? and then notice how much little things dont matter when you compare them to other stuff? yea. thats pretty much where i am now. ive been thinking about a lot of things, but the main thing is my relationship with christ. thats what should be the most important, crucial thing in my life. and i hate to admit it, but right now its not. and that makes me really sad. i just dont know how to do that. the most frustrating, heartbreaking thing is knowing what you want but not knowing how to get it.

      wow i had a great week. I LEARNED HOW TO SURF!!! it was incredible. ive always wanted to learn. the feeling of a wave breaking under your feet is sooo awesome. everybody should surf. but remember--a rash guard for your stomach is definitely worth it. but even while i was having the time of my life, i kept thinking about&nbsp;all yall back in aiken, everything happening in my&nbsp;life,&nbsp;and especially a certain person. it was driving me crazy...and who it&nbsp;is really surprised me...i didnt think that i liked&nbsp;this guy more than a friend. but who knows, i guess anything can happen...i was thinking about it, and looking for&nbsp;the right guy&nbsp;is like looking for seashells, even though that sounds really gay...you can look up and down the beach all day long and not find anything, and then when you think you find a good shell, it just washes out with the tide or turns out not to be the right one. then after all that, you just look down at your feet and theres what you were looking for the whole entire time...it was right in front of you, where you least expected it.

      im not one to cuss. i think its somewhat unnattractive and uncreative. i mean, you have to be creative to not cuss. some of my favorite non-cuss phrases include (most of yall will recognize these b/c i say them a lot) dagummit, holy crap, and, my personal favorite, "what the heck?" i remember once when i was little i said "what the hell...?" in front of my mom. now, i dont remember who i heard say that phrase...all i remember is the taste of ivory soap. i grew up in a southern baptist christian home (my dad used to be a pastor), and i was taught never to use profanities. but at the church that my parents and i go to now, the pastor cusses in his sermons. hm. so the question is...whos right? does god really care whether you use colorful language or not? i really dont know the answer to that. i can just guess. people like to use the phrase "what would jesus do?" or "wwjd?". i guess that can be applied here. but when i think about it, i can see jesus in his carpentry shop, missing the nail and hitting his thumb with a hammer instead and saying--"damn, that hurt." maybe im a heretic for saying that, but its just what i think. ill admit, some words do give a certain effect to what youre saying. one of my favorite rap songs (i cant remember what its called or who its by...) has a line in it that says "back up, b****, get the f*** out my way." now, if a huge black guy said that to you, youd get out of the way. but if he just said "excuse me sir/maam, would you mind stepping out of my way, please?", that would be a different story. you see, theres a certain ring to what you say when you use cuss words. they get the point across. the famous line "frankly, scarlett, i dont give a damn" wouldnt have been the same if rhett had told her "frankly, scarlett, i dont give a dagnabbit." its just not the same thing. the more i think about it, im pretty sure that it depends on the person and what he/she is thinking at the time. as long as you dont curse god or anything hes made, i dont think that he really cares whether you cuss or not. its whats in your heart. somewhere in the psalms it says "out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks" and i think that is so true. so i dont think it matters whether you cuss or not, as long as your heart is in the right place. once again, thats only my opinion and i know it doesnt apply to every situation. what do yall think about this? i want to hear your opinions, so feel free to leave a comment. ^^hey just to clear this up, my pastor doesnt just cuss all the time. and not every sermon. haha so dont think i go to some satan church lol^^

      the other day, i was talking to a friend about something that really pisses both of us off. we were talking about how girls always badmouth guys for thinking about sex 24/7. now, ive read statistics that say guys think about sex every 8 seconds, or 10,000 times a day. i guess thats an average? or else it must be wrong, because that cant be right... anyways, what pisses me off is how we (girls) act surprised when a guy says something fresh to us...and yet we walk around in ass-tight miniskirts and shirts that practically have flashing arrows pointing to our cleavage. now is there something wrong with this picture? or are girls really clueless? i think that if we really loved and appreciated guys, we wouldnt first of all wear something that would start them thinking (or try our best not to, because what girl doesnt like to know they look good?), and second of all, we wouldnt come down on guys so hard for something that they, to a certain point, cant control. thats just my opinion, and i understand it doesnt apply to every situation. but really, am i right, or am i just completely missing the point here? tell me what you think.

      i love to write. theres something about it that makes me believe that im doing something worthwhile. not that im a good writer, which im not. ive been journaling for about a year now, and its really awesome to be able to track my progress in life. im such a different person than i was a year ago. when i read entries from way back when, it makes me wonder if the change was sudden or gradual. its scary to think that if i changed that much in a year, what am i going to be like a year from now? what about five? fifty? i guess im just one of those people that worries about the future. who knows? only god does....

      im done.  thats right...im done.  im finished with trying to please everyone and make everyone happy but myself. the only thing that matters now is what i live my life for.  ive chosen to live it for god.  and if any of you have a problem with that, then i dont really need you. but ill guarantee you that as soon as you see the change in my heart...youll want to be right there with me.  im going to be happy. i am determined to let jesus christ make me happy.  tonight was a rough night. i was lying on the floor trying to clear my mind and think of the good things in my life. i thought about god and about all of you, all my awesome friends...my incredible boyfriend...my family...my dog, my cats...everything. and i realized something.  i dont understand life.  all i know is that jesus christ is life. hes the only reason im here right now facing my problems instead of running away like i used to do. hes the only reason that im sitting here typing at midnight getting my frustrations out when i havent finished my homework yet and i have so many apologies to make....  so right now im want to apoligize. i want to say im sorry for being someone im not. im sorry if i led yall on. but now im different. im not scared anymore. im jessie lanae eisenmann and im in love with jesus christ. call me a jesus freak, call me a fanatic, say what you will...i dont care. and its too bad if i change my lifestyle and it offends you for some odd reason. oh well. youre the one missing out on real life...life with a meaning and a purpose. if you really respect me and love me for who i am then youll respect my relationship with god because hes in me and im nothing without him. and right now im really not worried about anything thats happening...because i know that god is handling it for me like he has time and time again and like he always will.  if you only remember one thing that i wrote tonight, if you only get one thing out of this entry...i want it to be that yall know that you can rest in christ. no matter what happens...no matter what...god is there. hes always been there. hes always going to be there. hes wants to be close to you...closer to you than your own heartbeat.  and nothing...nothing...could ever change that.  so now you can all call me a different person...you can tell me that ive changed...because i am and i have.  the holes in my heart arent there anymore.  god must have some heavy-duty spackle...  :::jess:::

      "tears, idle tears, i know not what they mean, tears from the depth of some divine despair rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, in looking on the happy autumn-fields, and thinking of he days that are no more....."  thats from a poem by lord alfred tennyson...dont think im depressed or anything i just absolutely love that poem. im addicted to poetry i really am. when you get a chance, read the whole poem at poets.org and tell me what you think about it. just gives you the chills, doesnt it?  life is getting good...

      summers almost over and im trying to get my life back to somewhat normal by then...  im reading this book called "growing deeper in jesus christ" by ty saltzgiver...i recommend it to anyone and everyone that has a thirst to know jesus more than ever before. while i was reading i found my verse for this year...  "but whatever was to my profit i now consider less for the sake of christ. what is more, i consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing christ jesus my lord, for whose sake i have lost all things. i consider them rubbish, that i may gain christ and be found in him"...philippians 3:7-9  wow. i cant believe that i can actually get to a point in my relationship with christ that everything else would be "rubbish" compared to it. thats really hard to imagine. i love sports, my friends, my family, and i have big dreams for myself...how can all that just be rubbish? the answer lies in the fact that if the need be, i could give all of that up and not be diminished. as saltzgiver put it..."we can fool our friends and even decieve ourselves, but trying to fool god is an effort in futility. we must be hones with ourselves and with jesus or we will never grow to any depth with him"...so right now if i said that all the components of my life are "rubbish" compared to knowing jesus christ, i would be fooling myself. but i feel like if i dont do everything i can to get to that point in my relationship, it would all be a loss..  i also found this quote...it helped me out a lot maybe itll help you too...  "rest in the lord. let your intellect, your judgement, your reason,  rest in god"...james hamilton  ive found that ^^that^^ is the only thing that you can do when everythings going wrong and theres no one that can help you. dont worry about it...god takes care of us through everything because he loves us.

      i took a walk tonight...i never noticed how beautiful aiken is at twilight...the sky fades from a warm clay color at the horizon to a clear slate blue...and at this time of year you can just feel fall starting...well anyways i was walking my dog and trying to gain a perspective on everything...because ive changed since i talked to someone last night ((who helped me out more than he knows)) and i have a newfound hope...not in people, not in myself, but in god. because i know that no matter what happens ill always have him in my life. i thought about everybody, everything...the people that i love, the people that love me...and i want things to be back like they used to be...except better.  so i want yall to know that im doing what i can to make this situation turn out right...even though it prolly wont  and im back to my old self...and god is giving me the strength to keep it that way......

      love is patient, love is kind your mercy moves me every time  when you found me hiding out i thought you would take a hammer to my brow but you pushed away the crowd and cried, and pressed... your lips against my head  i was standing in the smoke...rising from the gun i was drunk i couldnt stand...drowning in a bottle oh, you found me, i covered up my head  i was swearing by the truth...i was living lies i was holding out a hand...to take what was not mine oh, you found me, i could not lift my head

      im so afraid, when i reach emerald city at the end of...the end of my road behind the heavy curtain what i thought was born of wisdom will turn to me and ask my advice  i hold my hammer looking for a wall looking for a rescue, looking for a sign, i claw the heavens hands made of straw ive got to find the truth and im running out of time i just want to go home, i just want to go home...  caught up in a whirlwind, i call my own religion the kind that runs away...runs away from home all the little voices running through my mind could not sing me peace or give me peace of mind   so i lay down, in this field of flowers and try to dream of a place that i love but i cant remember how to find the warm and tender kisses from the mouth of my god
