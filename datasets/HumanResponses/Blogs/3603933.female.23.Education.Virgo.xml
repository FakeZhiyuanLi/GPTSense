      I went to Target yesterday to pick up some medicine and walked out with Reeses peanut butter cups (the miniature ones), Reeses Scoops, and Peanut Butter Toast Crunch.    I just started to really love peanut butter.  I used to not like it at all.  Now I love it.  And I guess yesterday I was craving it.  And yes, that is Peanut Butter Toast Crunch cereal, as in Cinnamon Toast Crunch but not cinnamon, peanut butter.  I am now convinced it is the best food ever invented.  If you haven't tried it you should.

      I haven't had internet access since last week - since we moved into our house and the cable wiring is messed up.  Thus we can't hook up our cable internet and our phone lines were having problems too.  But now our phone lines are back up so I'm using dial up connection.  It's amazing how I rely on internet so much now, I was about going crazy this week without it!  But I am okay now, and I can finally post all that has happened.  A lot.    We are in our house.  I have everything unpacked except for one room - my office.  But hopefully I will finish that this week.  We love everything so far.  Except for the cable wiring.  And soon we will start painting everything.  There is only one room that we don't want to change.  The purple bathroom.  Really, it's cool.  Yesterday I had my 3rd interview for the homeschooling job.  I found out I was up against one other person.  They said that they would let me know by today.  And at 3:30 today the phone rang and it was them...they offered me the job!  I accepted and am thrilled beyond belief.  I still can't believe I got it!   I am going in tomorrow to meet the girls I will be teaching and work with the current teacher to look over curriculum and things like that.  I am excited.  And then today is my wedding anniversary, two years ago today Kyle and I were getting hitched.  He was so sweet, he came home with flowers and this perfume I've been wanting and other nice little presents.  Then we went out to dinner to celebrate life.    I talked to my mom today and was telling her how much is going so well right now.  My life is pretty much perfect, I said, so what is going to go wrong?  Something has to go wrong, it's just too good.  My mom said that God gives us seasons of joy and to be glad for those.  Yes, but my season has lasted for over two years!  And it just keeps getting better.  And what about seasons of sorrow?  She said that a season isn't just six months, it can be a while and to be glad for it.  More than that though, God is what gives joy, and by following God and making good choices joy results.  It was good to talk to her.  It is getting late and I actually have to get up for work tomorrow.  Later.

      There's so much I could write about but I just don't have the time.  The last few days have been a whirlwind of fun and nervousness and it's not finished yet.  Within those days I had Lila for one afternoon, hung out with Suzanne, went to the doctor, had my interview, watched the Hartges kids for a night,and went into my new house for the first time.  Hanging out with Lila was a blast - we smam, went on a walk, and just hung out.  We spent a little time with Jaden and Suzanne too.  I think I could get used to this playing with kids all day thing.  My doctor told me I need to eat more salt - yes!  I love salt.    Watching the Hartges kids was cool too.  Kyle and I went over and made dinner, then the kids came home and we hung out.  They are 5 and 7.  They also have a 9 and 11 year old, but they were with their parents.    Oh yes, and the interview.  It went...alright I thought.  There were 60 applicants, and I was the 12th person she had interviewed.  Some people have already had second interviews.  I wasn't feeling to0 optimistic when the teacher who interviewed me said good-bye, but then a half hour later I got a call back to come in for a second interview.  Today at 3:00!  I'm meeting with the father of the girls.  I'll write later about how things go.  And our house...we went in last night to check it out, see what cleaning needed to be done.  The previous homeowner are awesome - they cleaned everything perfectly and it is all ready to be moved into.  It's exciting.  We might move some things today but most everything will be put in tomorrow.  It will be nice to get settled in and get all of our food unpacked.  I just ate Cheetos for breakfast (as I did yesterday) because that is really all we have in our closet.  But I have to admit, it's kind of fun.  Cheetos are good.  And they taste salty, so I'm just following doctor's orders, right?

      I'm in the middle of three books right now.  Actually, I just finished one so I guess that makes it two, but I still have that third one on my mind.  The books are Catherdral, by Raymond Carver; Blue Like Jazz, by Donald Miller; and Ivanhoe, by Sir Walter Scott.  They are all very different but I really like them all.    Blue Like Jazz was recommended by a ton of people I know and I am reading it while some of my friends read it too.  Here is a taste:  Author's Note: I never liked jazz music because jazz music doesn't resolve.  But I was outside the Bagdad Theater in Portland one night when I saw a man playing the saxaphone.  I stood there for fifteen minutes, and he never opened his eyes. After that I liked jazz music. Sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself.  It is as if they are showing you the way. I used to not like God because God didn't resolve.  But that was before any of this happened.   Excerpt from Chapter 2: I believe the greatest trick of the devil is not to get us into some sort of evil but rather have us wasting time.  This is why the devil tries so hard to get Christians to be religious.  If he can sink a man's mind into habit, he will prevent his heart from engaging God.    Cathedral, a recommendation from Dan, is refreshing. I had never read Raymond Carver before and now I want to read everything.  Cathedral is a bunch of short stories written in a minimalist style.  This is the book I just finished.  When I read it, I felt like I was people watching at a park.  Actually, it was probably more like peeping into people's windows at night.  A very close look at life.  Ivanhoe, well, I have been reading this for what seems like forever.  I think I bought it at a yard sale a couple of years ago because I had heard of it and it looked like a book I should read as an English teacher.  I think I picked it up to read a few months ago.  I read a couple of pages a day, if I have more time, I might get a chapter in.  It's set in twelfth-century England and has crusades and chivalry and all that.  It was written in 1812 so the language is different but it's also cool.  I am always looking for book suggestions so if anyone has any recommendations let me know.

      Depression hit today.  Or maybe just reality.  The reality of no job.  I've been looking for a job since my student teaching ended in April and today was one of the first times that I really felt discouraged.    I've been sending out resumes to every English teaching job that I can find, though that's not very many.  There just aren't many jobs out there.  I've also sent out a few resumes for jobs working with kids in other areas (counseling, youth services) but not many there either.  So today I just wanted to crawl back into bed and not get out for the rest of the week.  I even tried it.  But it only lasted a couple of hours and then I got hungry.  Then I went running.  It's my sanity, one of the only things that gets me out of my apartment sometimes.  I always feel better afterwards - an hour to think, to pray, to clear my head.  It helped.  Then I showered, wrote out my frustrations, and then I heard a little beep.  My cell phone had a message.  Turns out that during my run someone had called me to set up an interview!  I called back and we played phone tag but we finally talked this evening.  It's for a position homeschooling two girls, a second grader and a fourth grader.  I have an interview on Thursday at 3:30.  The girl who is the current teacher is the one conducting the interviews and the one I talked to tonight.  She seemed so nice and I felt comfortable talking with her right away.  Even though I'm a secondary teacher (grades 7-12) she said she'd still like to meet with me.  She is actually secondary as well but she taught the girls.  She even graduated with the same degree that I have (Secondary English - Major, Religious Studies - Minor) so that was kind of cool.  She did mention that there were a ton of applicants though - so this won't be easy.  Another cool thing is that the family has two other kids that are going to Lansing Christian next year - a school that I went to and have worked with the last few years.    So now I have butterflies in my stomach and I will until Thursday.  Even if I don't get this job, I needed this to pick me up.    Funny how God waits until I feel like I just can't take anymore...

      I am surprised I am up so early considering the time we finally made it home last night.  A good night.  An interesting night.  Kyle is still sleeping.  He will probably still be sleeping for a few hours.  The wedding started at 6:00pm.  It was the first wedding I had been to at Riverview and it was very nice.  Kirsten and I were talking about what we'd be doing there for Nicole's wedding and it's exciting to think about that!  Then we headed over to the reception which was in Mason - soon to be my town!  We were all starving and there were some appetizers so we ate some of that and hit the bar.  From that point on it was Sangria, Malibu Punch, dinner, a little dancing, a lot hanging out outside, and a lot of interesting conversation.  Oh, and the dj was...what did he call himself?...Smooth Cruisin' I think.  That added comedy to the night.  It was a great time though.  I got to see a lot of people from the Amsterdam trip that I really miss spending time with and talking to.  And then I got to know some other people a little better that I usually see around but never talk to more than a few minutes.    Jen and I were talking about friendships/relationships last night and we got to talking about confronting people when they've offended you and losing friendships over fights and things like that.  I've been thinking about that and I really think that if two friends get in a fight (and I don't mean something ongoing or super deep) and then it's over because of that fight, then it wasn't really a friendship.  What I love about my friends - my best friends being Kyle and Nicole - is that we can be real and ugly with each other and we are still that close.  Plus, I am not one of those avoid-conflict people and I even sometimes start little fights on purpose.  So I guess that I might see it differently if I hated fighting. But I think back to my best friends in high school, the friends that I was close to for years and felt like family with, and we would get mad at each other and in fights but we loved each other like mad.  But we weren't the type to talk about each other behind people's backs either, we'd deal with stuff.  I do have a lot of people now that I would consider very close friends that I've never fought with.  I don't think I HAVE to fight with someone to be their friend - but I do think that'd if something did come up we'd make it through.

      We can now officially call ourselves homeowners!  We closed yesterday and everything worked out.   There was one small glitch - we thought we'd be able to move in right after closing and it turns out the homeowners can't be out until June 24th, so we have nine more days until we can get in.  It actually works out even better this way because the homeowners are paying us rent for everyday they stay in the house. Also this way we can get everything packed up and moved in on the same day since I have so much time to pack still.  We are scheduling Saturday, June 26th, as our moving day. Anyone who wants to help come on over!  Also, anyone who is moving and needs a real estate agent and mortage person, go through Lon and Rebekah McCracken (unless my dad moves here and has his real estate license, then you could go through him too!).  They were excellent to work with and SO MUCH FUN!  They made what could have been a very painful process painless.  If you need their numbers I have them.  And here is the link to some pictures of the house http://homepage.mac.com/kranzoky/PhotoAlbum1.html  Keep in mind that all the stuff in the house is the homeowners.   We plan on painting quite a few of the rooms and putting in wood floors through the entire first floor.

      I always hear "nothing's final until the closing" when people are buying a house.  Well, now I know the true meaning of that phrase.  I am buying a house.  So far, everything has gone smoothly.  Extremely smoothly.  Until today.  And closing is set for 2:30 tomorrow. The homeowners found out today they have a lean on their house for $7,500 that they weren't aware of.  All leans are required to be paid off before a house can be sold.  So if closing is to proceed, they have to come up with that money and pay it to the city of Mason by tomorrow.  Actually their real estate agent has agreed to pay $3,500 hundred of that because it is her fault that they weren't aware of this.  So they just need the rest of the money. The only other option the homeowners have (besides paying the money) is to relist the house for that much more.  Even though I feel upset about it, I feel even worse for the homeowners going through this.  They have already moved out of their house, which means they are probably paying rent in some apartment.  And they are buying a house in Connecticut - probably a difficult process since they live here.  And then this comes up.  I just have to remember that if we are meant to be here then we will be.  We are finding out tomorrow morning what's going on.  I'll keep you posted, and if we do end up getting it I'll post pictures of the house. Until then...I'll be waiting and living out of the boxes that are already packed

      I am teaching Sunday School to 4th and 5th graders tomorrow.  The topic: Samson and Delilah, the story from Judges where Samson reveals his weakness to a woman and God takes away his strength. Here is an example of why I do NOT follow the curriculum. (This is straight from my curriculum book given to the Sunday School teachers) **** Teacher Says:  Let's play a game to find out how Samson might have felt about listening to Delilah's constant nagging.  Instructions:  Have kids form groups of five to ten and stand in a large circle.  Choose one person to be "Delilah."  The players standing in the circe will be "Samsons" and will hold their arms up in a strong pose.  Have Delilah go from player to player inside the circle and try to lower each of the Samsons' arms while saying in a sad, whiney voice, "Oh, Samson!  What makes you so strong?"  Encourage Delilah to use dramatic facial expressions or a silly voice and to push or pull down on each Samson's arms to make him or her laugh and become weak.  AFter Delilah has succeeded in weakening each of the Samson's in the group, choose another Delilah and continue the game until everyone has had a turn to try to weaken the Samsons. ****  Who writes these curriculums?

      Everyone else seems to have a blog so I thought I would have one too.  I don't know who will read it but I guess it might be sort of therapeutic to write about life.  And since my sister and parents are too far away, this could them know what's going on with me.  I love that my sister has one so I know what's going on there.

      Spent the day driving up North to Kaleva with Kara, then back to Lansing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to pick up Kara's three dogs - Roo, Dark Star, and Kya (sp?).&nbsp; Kara and Jay are moving back to the Lansing area (which I am VERY happy about!) and she has been driving back and forth like crazy to take care of the dogs for a couple of days and then come back here to work on the house her and Jay are fixing up.&nbsp; Today we were going to bring all three dogs back with us as they have the kennel ready at their new house.  Didn't exactly work out how we had expected.&nbsp; We got to the house after a three hour drive.&nbsp; Dark Star and Roo got in a massive dog fight.&nbsp; It was crazy and very scary.&nbsp; It was crazy because these dogs have been together the last four years.&nbsp; They are very cool dogs - one is a beautiful Husky and the other a Lab/Shepard mix.&nbsp; Then there is Kya, a big version of Bali, and super sweet.&nbsp; They all love each other.  But today Roo was having dominance issues or something.&nbsp; Kara put down some food for the dogs and Dark Star and Roo started fighting over it.&nbsp; And I mean really fighting, locked onto each other.&nbsp; Kara was screaming at the dogs and trying to separate them, I was screaming at Kara to not get right in the middle because I was scared to death she would get hurt - that they would bite her trying to get to one another.&nbsp; We tried everything to get them apart and finally Kara got ahold of Roo and threw him in the other room and we slammed the door to separate the two.&nbsp; Kara had blood all over her khakis, her floors - Dark Star's beautiful face is really cut up.&nbsp;   Needless to say, we couldn't bring them all back in the same car.&nbsp; We brought Roo back and left the other two up north- Kara and Jay are going back Friday to get them.&nbsp; She is afraid that she can't ever put the two dogs together again.&nbsp; So I'm interested to hear how they do on Friday.&nbsp;   Definitely a day I will remember.&nbsp; It was very nice spending so much time with Kara too.&nbsp;

      I am working right now on a freelance editing/research job based on the  urlLink Scopes Monkey Trial .&nbsp; It is extremely interesting and challenging - challenging for my own beliefs and life.  The trial was a famous trial that took place in the 1920's, and was pretty much a debate between conservative Christians and evolutionists.&nbsp; John Scopes was tried for teaching evolution in a school, which at the time was illegal.&nbsp; There's a whole lot more to it than that though.&nbsp; Inherit the Wind is the famous movie that was made based on the trial, but there are a lot of facts that have been twisted and it's not completely accurate.  I am reading through the actual transcript of the trial and doing some research within that.&nbsp; It is causing me to really scrutizine certain passages in the Bible and&nbsp;interpret these&nbsp;for myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: The Creation Story, Joshua's Battle (where the&nbsp;sun stands still), The Tower of Babble, The Flood, etc.&nbsp;  I&nbsp;have always&nbsp;known of these stories&nbsp;but never taken everything literally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;creation - I&nbsp;always thought the seven days represented periods of time, not actual days.&nbsp; But&nbsp;there's a lot&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;finding out&nbsp;that may be causing me to re-evaluate my beliefs, or at least search deeper.&nbsp;  Now if only I had time to learn Hebrew and Greek.

      Incident Type: Burglary  Complaint's Name: Price, Daniel  Victim's Name: Kranzo, Melissa  Mr. Price (complainant) stated that he and the victims are staying at the incident location for vacation and Mrs. Kranzo (victim 1) observed an unknown black male walk out of the condo.&nbsp; Mrs. Kranzo siad that she and another female were at the pool and when they went back to the condo the male walked out holding Mrs. Kranzo's brown and red pocketbook.&nbsp; Mrs. Kranzo confronted the supsect and at first he said he knew someone inside the condo.&nbsp; The supsect then said that he found it outside the door and was going to return it.&nbsp; Mrs. Kranzo received her pocketbook back and she went inside to check on Mr. Everett (victim 2) and Mr. Price, who were sleeping.&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspect had left the scene when Mrs. Kranzo walked back outside.&nbsp; Mr. Price said that they were not going to report the incident but found that a brown leather wallet was missing that belonged to Mr. Everett.&nbsp; Mr. Everett said that the wallet contained approx. $50 in U.S currency, 1 debit card, 1 Blue Cross/Blue Shield card, 1 Michigan Drivers License.&nbsp; Mr. Everett stated that he cancelled the debit card.  _____________________________________________________  So that is pretty much it.&nbsp; It's not completely right though.&nbsp; First of all,&nbsp;I don't own a "pocketbook," rather I carry a bag.&nbsp; (It's funny that he called it a pocketbook, it makes it sound like an old lady leather purse)  The other untruths 1) I did not come back to the condo with anyone else, just me. 2)&nbsp;The didn't say he was going to return the purse, he actually said that the door was open and my purse was laying in the doorway and he didn't know what was going on. 3) There was a lot more conversation between me and the guy.&nbsp; I think he was really confused when he was caught in the act! 4) Matt's wallet wasn't really stolen.&nbsp; Kite had accidently picked it up and taken it with him for the day.&nbsp;   So nothing was taken.&nbsp; Just an interesting event to keep things exciting here!

      Today we had&nbsp;a minor scare. &nbsp; I came home to the condo and found a guy with my purse in his hand outside with the front door wide open.&nbsp; I got the purse back (I had to ask for it twice) and it turned out nothing else was missing.&nbsp; Dan and Matt were both in the condo but were sleeping when the guy came in.&nbsp; &nbsp; I will post the police report - it's a good summary of what happened - but I don't have it on me right now.&nbsp; I will do that tomorrow so you guys can get all the details.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It was bizarre. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I am getting a new puppy! &nbsp; Not Bali, as I originally intended.&nbsp; Another mini dashchund though, but a reddish brown color, not black and tan.&nbsp; She is seven weeks right now but I will be getting her in a little over two weeks.&nbsp; She is being shipped from Georgia.&nbsp; I didn't know they shipped puppies, but I guess they do.&nbsp; It's very safe and temperature controlled, don't worry. &nbsp; I need a name for her now.&nbsp; I had a boy dog name all picked out, but no idea about a girl dog name.&nbsp; Suggestions welcome, but nothing typical.

      We are here.&nbsp; It was an interesting trip.  &nbsp;  We started out Friday around 5:30.&nbsp; We made it to Chelsea, MI, where we hit a lot of traffic.&nbsp; Then heard a wierd noise.&nbsp; It was our car overheating.&nbsp; By the time we got out of traffic and off an exit it was 7:30.&nbsp; No shop open to get our car looked at and fixed, but luckily we have two guys that know something about cars.&nbsp; (Matt Everett drove down with us)&nbsp; We stopped at Meijer and the guys bought an oil pan, thermostat, and some other tools and flushed the radiator and changed the thermostat.&nbsp; We were on our way again at 9:30.&nbsp;&nbsp; The car still overheats whenever it is in traffic and we now know it is because the fan is broken.&nbsp; But we made it to Myrtle Beach alright.  &nbsp;  The drive was good.&nbsp; Good conversation and I hardly drove at all.  &nbsp;  The last two days here have been rainy so Suzanne, Jaden, and I have been hanging out in the condo while the guys have practiced and played a couple of times.&nbsp; Today there is a lot of sun and it is HOT so we are going to hit the beach.&nbsp; After we bring the car in to the shop that is.  &nbsp;  We only have internet access in the forum (part of the church) so I don't get online very often, but I'll try and keep posting whenever I can.&nbsp; Dan, Suzanne, Noel, and Nicole are also here so their blogs should reflect what's going on too.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I can't believe we are leaving for  urlLink LT  in two days.  This is my first LT and I am pretty excited.  It helps that pretty much all my friends will be there too.  We just found out recently that we are going because Kyle is playing drums.  The band this year will be sweet. And I'm looking forward to the hot, sunny weather. I am a southern girl living in a northern state (well, I was born in the south, does that count?)  There's a lot to do before we leave.  So much that I probably shouldn't be using my time writing this blog, but oh well.  I began priming my kitchen.  What was supposed to be a three day project is turning out to be much longer.  It took me one day to take off the border and tape the walls.  The day after that I had to sand and start priming.  Today I am hoping to finish the priming, but that probably won't happen.  I will probably finish tomorrow and then leave the painting until after we get back.   We are doing Martini Olive and Simply White in the Kitchen.  And we are also painting the cabinets.  Everyone wants to know why we are painting over brand new oak - it's just not our style.  If anyone wants to explore colors for a room,  urlLink Behr  has a pretty cool website.

      This has been quite an interesting weekend.  Today I went to my good friend Meggan's wedding.  It was an Applebee reunion and it was nice seeing some of my old friends.  The wedding was pretty thought provoking for me.  Concerning religion and ritual and symbolism in religion.   Catholic Wedding.  My first real Catholic wedding, and my first real glimpse at Catholic services as an adult.  I went to a Catholic church once when I was in middle school.  I thought it was beautiful - the service, the communion, the building, the formality.  After that I had a positive feeling towards Catholicism - I also have grandparents that are as Catholic as can be and a very close friend who is a strong Catholic.  By strong Catholics, I mean that they don't just call themselves Catholic because they go to church.  They take God very seriously and go deeper.    After witnessing what I did today in church though, I wasn't left with such a pleasant taste.  I see how ritual can make things empty and how the symbolism of the religion can be easily lost on people.  I don't know how to explain it really.  I've always thought that Catholics are Christians, as long as they follow Jesus as God's son and their savior.  I still do feel this way.  I guess I see Catholicism as a way that some people choose to express their Christian spirituality, but I also see that a lot of people choose it as a way to feel "heavenbound" when they really aren't.  The other big part of today is that I now have roomates Jen and Eric moved in today and we now have a lot of food and two cats!  This will be an experience but I know it will a good one.   Tonight we all watched the movie the Butterfly Effect.  I wasn't expecting to like it 1) It is called a thriller and I don't like scary movies 2) It is a popular advertised "hollywood" movie 3) It has Ashton Kutcher in it But I really did like it.  The whole idea behind it was kind of cool and it kept me interested.  I wouldn't watch it again or anything but I liked it while watching it.  Now it is late so I should go to bed.  The wonderful thing about right now is that I don't have to set the alarm tomorrow - no agenda for the day.  That's a wierd feeling and a good one.

      Another perk to my new job - free horse lessons!  Since the family I work for owns a  urlLink horse stable  and a lot of horses I can ride whenever I want to.  Not that I have ever really ridden before.  I think I have been on a horse twice before.  Once when I was really young, so young that I can't quite remember it.  The other time was when I was a junior in high school and my famiy took a vacation in southern Ohio.  All I remember about that was that my dad rode a horse named Flash and that was hilarious.  Flash: the slowest and most rebellious horse you can imagine.   Today after I finished working in the classroom I went out to the  urlLink stable  with Annaliese (one of the girls in the family) and we went to the pasture to pick out Star, a beautiful (though slightly fat) horse.  I have never been so close to so many large animals without a fence.  We just walked right into the pasture and about five large horses came right up to us - I got to pet them!    Annaliese then took me to the indoor arena and she taught me how to sit on the horse correctly first.  Then I learned how to trot and how to move with the horse so that while trotting it didn't feel bouncy.  I never really saw myself liking something like this but it was very cool.    I am going to keep taking lessons I think.

      What did you do for the fourth of July?  Kyle and I were not good patriotic Americans.  We didn't watch the fireworks, we didn't wear red, white, and blue - we went smimming and ordered pizza in our hotel room.  It was very fun.  We went to Chicago for the weekend to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.  We have a goal that by our 50th anniversary we will have spent one anniversary in each state.  So far we have hit Hawaii (honeymoon), Virginia (last year Virginia Beach) and now Illinios.  Next year I am thinking either Montana, Iowa, or Kentucky.  We've gotta hit them sometime, and I want something other than big city.    Chicago was cool.  We did Ikea.  I would never have imagined how many people would be there.  It was quite an experience.  We got a lot more home decorating ideas - as if I don't have enough from TLC or HGTV.  Now all we need is money to implement those ideas, and time.  We also went downtown and did "Taste of Chicago."  It was a lot of food, a lot of people, and music.  It was like a hybrid Woodstock and Common Ground.  We walked around for a while but then left to walk the city and then went back to the hotel pretty early.  There was a pool and we swam with some other unpatriotic kids while the fireworks went off.

      I am once again traveling.  Only for a few days though.  I made it into Philadelphia last night at around 1:30am.  I had been scheduled to arrive at  9pm.  There was delay, after delay, after delay... but I actually don't mind being in airports.  I had my computer and a book and a lot of interesting people to look at.  By then end of the trip I had even made some airport friends - funny how sometimes being in bad situations is how you have a good time getting to know people.  And this morning was very cool because I got to see Mason after not seeing him for an entire year!  Mason is my friend Steph's little boy - Steph is my friend from way back in the day, when I used to live here in PA.  I visit her every year and the last time I saw Mason he was just turning 1.  Now he is 2 and it is crazy how big he is!  And everything he says!   It is very nice to be back with Steph again.  Even though we don't see each other all the time, whenever we get back together it is like we haven't lost any time.   I do already miss Kyle and Iri.  I have to say though, last night was the best sleep I've gotton since we got Iri.  I actually slept for five hours straight!  I think I might go back to bed in a little bit here: I got up at 7am when Mason and Steph were leaving for work.  They will be gone all day and it is SO NICE to have a full day to just do whatever I want...which will be reading, sleeping, and running.  I am reading a book  Girl with a Pearl Earring  by Tracy Chevalier and am almost done.  I really like it, the simplicity of the writing is very beautiful to me.  I think I'll finish it now and then go back to bed. This is the life!

      My life is never again to be the same.  Our new puppy arrived!!  I picked her up from the Flint airport this morning.  She came in a nice little travel case and seemed to adjust to Kyle and I just fine!  She was great on the car ride home and we have been playing with her all afternoon.  I think we tired her out a bit because she is curled up in my lap asleep right now.  I will post pictures tonight - she really is the cutest thing ever!   Her name is Iri.

      We finally have dial up internet in our cabins so we don't have to drive an hour to use the computer anymore!  It's getting pretty late and we have a long day tomorrow so I won't write much.  Tomorrow we are going to Montreal to spend the day in the city and check it out.    Today was a good day.  Began with all of us girls doing an 8 mile bike/run.  Joey, mom, and Nicole biked, I ran.  It was pretty cool because we ran 4 miles to a bridge where the guys had driven the wave runners too.  We watched them drive around the water for a while (and fall off a couple of times) and then came back.  Chaz came really close to us and sprayed us with water - Joey and I got soaked.  So the whole way back we were really wet and we are trying to think of a way to get back at him.  Sometime during the next couple of days he is going to get a bucket of water dumped on him when he is least expecting it.  Then we went to a winery in the afternooon and it was awesome.  Did some wine tasting and ended up buying a very expensive bottle of an incredible dessert wine.  (It is half the size of a regular bottle of wine too.)  Don't worry our wine loving friends, Nicole and Chaz got a bottle too and if you're lucky me just might share!  Really though, it's the best wine I've EVER tasted.  It's called ice wine, and super sweet and the highest alcohol content of any of their wines.    Then we did our usual Euchre playing and ate yet another incredible dinner.  And I ate steak.  And it was so good.  Can you believe it?

      We are in Vermont now.  We drove about an hour to Burlington so that we could use the wireless internet and do all the computer stuff.  If I could sum up our experience so far in one word it would be - rustic.  The cabins, the area, the mouse droppings, the termites... Not that it's been bad, but there really are termites and mouse droppings!  So we've been here for two days and had many interesting experiences.  It has been SO FUN though.   Check out Nicole's blog for some more details too.  She's here with me.  It's my parents, Rick and Joey, Nicole, soon to be Chaz, Kyle and myself.   A few things about the trip so far-  Burlington, VT is one of the coolest cities ever.  It's like a mix between Boston and East Lansing.  The people are VERY friendly - random strangers have been coming up and talking to us as we are sitting here on the internet.   I drove a wave runner by myself for the first time today.  We are staying on Lake Champlaigne (a huge lake, often considered the sixth Great Lake) and my parents brought their two wave runners.  It was pretty fun.  Nicole, my mom, and I woke up early and biked 12 miles this morning.  It is beautiful here.  Rolling hills, mountains, the coastline.  I have also had amazing runs and want to try different routes every day that I'm here.   We did the biggest grocery shopping I have ever done in my life yesterday.  We all guessed how much the total would be - my dad and I thought we were guessing high when we guessed the mid $300s.  Turned out we were low.  $438 was the total.  Thank you mom and dad!!  And as I write, I am sitting outside on Church street in Burlington.  It's 10:15pm - Chaz was supposed to be in at 10:00 but he is unfortunately still sitting on the runway in Lansing.  Poor Chaz!  So it looks like we will be in town for a while, hoping he gets in tonight.  There are tons of bars and little shops on the street with internet access.  Imagine Grand River but much cooler and much bigger, and the road is blocked of so that only people can walk on it.  It's a Monday night and it's still hoppin.  We just saw a girl and a guy get in a fighting match in the middle of the street - oh, they are fighting again right now!  They are right next to us now.  Lots of college kids, lots of drinking it looks like.  We should be back in town tomorrow so I will try and post more then.
