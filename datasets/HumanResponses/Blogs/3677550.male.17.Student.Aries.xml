      went to queensway with gl ws hm gene and chuan... bought 2       t-shirts for $20... realised i am facing financial crisis... and later jack's place for father's day celebration... i really can't be a spendthrift now... if not i have to beg my mum again for daily expenses... well anyway... i felt so bad the whole day... i think i need counselling... but who cares? along the way home on the bus 855... gl and ws were just tempting us to ask them what was so amazing about something that we do not know... and eventually never say out...eugene was so gian to ask everytime.. that reminds me of a scene which happened 4 yrs ago... jingyi and the gang... being so secretive about every word and such... at that point of time... i felt so devastated then... looking back... i was that "eugene" who was so curious and lastly ended up in despair... why shld friends keep so many from each others? what the hell are friends anyway...? well at least for today i did not felt that agitated about those things... but somehow i did not felt too happy about it... aries... go to hell... well... going to jack's place soon... that's it for now...

      well here i am again... i forgot the passwords for all the previous blogs i attempted to write and maintain... yes, attempted, which meant i failed... haha... definitely getting bored these few months, so i decided to ATTEMPT one more time... note that i nv use the word "last" =p  well here goes... i dyed my hair... pure golden... sucks... not what i expected but brooding over won't help i guess? i'll have to learn to get use to it... and NO WAY i will dye it back to my original black unless for some cases like SP dun allow me into the compound... bleh... hope won't though... haha.. well and now i am working as a installer and able to go to different ministries of singapore... but who cares right... truthfully... though this job does not drain ur energy physically, i think psychologically yes. since i took this job up from derek i dun think it's nice to quit and whatsoever... and to think that i was looking forward to it before the work began! 3 mths of idling sure sucks... but work sucks more =p well 5 more days to endure and it'll be over! hmmm... but poly's starting almost right after the job... and for once i hopw the holiday would stretch longer... perhaps a week or so? haha... i can continue dreaming...  but nowadays i felt so lifeless... returned from work at about 6pm everyday and since my bro had ROD, he's at home almost everyday and anytime... so that means i can only use the com at a later time like now, 12AM, A-M! wanted to play lar... but all offline... so for now being online is just as good as lying on my damn bed and that's the reason i turned to this blog once again... for the whole week it'd been like this... i hate to spend days like this... it's totally like a fucking walking dead who wants to be dead than wandering around and accomplishing nothing... tends to get a bit jealous and angry when i see somebody else i know doing something and i for now grumbling over nothingness... sunday is father's day and my bro decided to buy something that costs $60 which means each needs to pay $30... i checked my amount in my bank... one word, pathetic. i really regretted volunteering to lend huge amounts even to pple that i am close with... if one day they EVER return me i would have $600 more in my account... it's so fucking fucked up... and my couz is telling me whether i can give him the $ for the 4 days of work first... i lent him so much for his o lvls last october (8 mths ago) and he haven't return 1 cent back and now he wants me to give him the $ to buy his poly stuffs... i talked to him about this 2 mths ago and he said he will try to return... try? i can't feel the afford put in... idling around in the holidays for so long... and complaining that he can't find jobs... i just cannot believe it man... i know talking about money matters will hurt feelings but hey, i have feelings too ok? i really cannot believe there are pple who can withstand this... it really boils my blood when i thought of this... can't blame me right? i borrowed $350 from you and 8 mths not 1 cent returned although i promised you i'll return asap. and out of the 8 mths... 6 mths are holiday... i worked and earned $800 for the first mth...and idle at home for the rest of the holiday... bought a hp plan and still happily tell u i got handphone now, but still failed to return u ONE CENT yet.... i am really fucking pissed off... i dun care whether relatives or what or cold-blooded... try putting me in ur shoes... I AM NOT ANGRY ABOUT THE MONEY, IT'S THE LACK OF SINCERITY IN IT. i can't fucking see an afford in it... fuck it... yes... fuck off...

      headache... project + emotions all clashing together... felt like exploding at one time... now feeling a bit better... coz the project proposal is almost done... can considered done oso... then emotions part... 习惯了。。。 haha... just that i can't take 2 blows at 1 time... i will become lunatic... will try to be serious most of the time liao... not a kid anymore... laughing over small lame matters is a definite no-no... say goodbye to the old me... this process is just like morphing of small insects... a total change... just that i am still in the process of it... and when time comes, i hope i would be a better man...

      went for cip briefing with wx gang, jh and ch... danny too.. i personally think that the project is totally bullshit... yes... shit... ok so nvm... let it be... i wonder why SP wants us to do cip hours, this ain't even helping anything except for the CC... ass club...  went prata with gl and hm... i realised i can't really control myself or tell myself what i want to do... no matter what i tried... i am still the same old me... the useless me... i feel tired psychologically with all these things happening... now i understand why some pple get 忧郁症... at first i tot they were just scaring themselves, and only imaginating things that aren't real... although i know some are purely imaginations... the brain is one sophisticated thing to mess with... it ain't as easy as u think it could be... and i, here trying to control it, gets controlled instead... so it is not up to individual to choose what they can do... and it's totally played by the brain... the more u resist, the more agony u will get... i wonder whether i really should get some counselling from some professionals.... i really have no idea when i will turn mad... i can barely take it now... and if one day this whole system breaks down... i am none other than one mind-dead human....   yea, and today i changed the blog website... main purpose is i dun really feel like letting others read or know my things... those dark side of things... perhaps one day though, but not now... my mind now told me i can't trust anyone that much....

      omg... i really can't stand myself anymore... during the starting of the practise, i was doing quite good until they changed to a different style; to change the story and mood immediately after 2 person had acted... must volunteer to replace one of the 2 actors there... but wtf was i doing?? didn't dare to volunteer coz my english speech sucks... and u need to change quickly so as to catch up the partner... and i did nothing but watch the show only... had a feeling the instructor is a bit disappointed in me... coz he still praised me at start... then no one tot... haizzz... i am so freaking disappointed in this junk me... and i still dare say "i am gonna fight for it no matter what it will cost me".... grrrr.... that was my limit? i can't believe i am such a weakling... NEXT WEEK, by hook or by crook, I WILL STEP OUT AND MUMBLE SO WORDS OUT AT LEAST, if not... i better off be dead...

      4 hours of lessons today, and i nv really listened to what the 2 teachers said... maybe a bit lar... but i know though my body was there, my soul wasn't... too indulged in my own thinkings... fancinations... all the things... and the worries... do i&nbsp;still stand any chance because of my height? i hope it won't really affect much... guys, if u have any ideas how to grow taller, do tell me :p  well, came back home and checked my inbox... there, i received a reply from the threatre compass cca... some sort of cca lar... it say that i can go... and welcomed too... no need experience oso... nice... every tuesday 5.30... to dunno what time lar... i really hope i will enjoy the training there... coz u won't know how excited i am... and i suddenly noticed a change in me... bit more matured... perhaps?

      well i think the urge is still there... suddenly i felt that there are nothing more meaningful than having fame... this feeling's so awkward... and excited as well... i know these kind of things almost impossible lar... but i think i need to do something for it before i really fail it? cuz in that case at least i tried...&nbsp;i wonder, what would make my way nearer to my dreams? firstly,&nbsp;join the drama cca? i suddenly felt like acting... my emotions are always swinging up and down... sometimes, i just want to have a try in acting... perhaps it might fit, who knows? secondly, i think i need to cut down on my weight and transform the fats into muscles... hmmm maybe not like those "world's strongest man's muscles" lar... theirs are too nice to be true... what i meant was... can see a bit of muscles can liao... the shape, 6 pacs... can continue dreaming :) Thirdly, must cut down on food... i think i am doing well in this sector... compared to few bowls of rice and always "foraging" for food when hungry... now for certain i cut down a lot from it... heh... Fourthly (got this word meh? LOL), need to get myself tanned... now my skin colour looks like ah gua... haha... feel offended when pple say it... but i also noticed it's quite true lor... so no point blaming a person who's not distorting any facts... Fifth, try not to&nbsp;act stupid and laugh when i am too happy... sometimes i am disgusted by this also... but cannto help it mah... my own self... but i will try to kick this habit away... LASTLY, my height. 170cm... very short for a guy... but i know this one i can't do anything about it lar... genetic what... my mum merely 155cm, my elder&nbsp;bro 171cm, my dad 170cm, it's almost impossible that i shoot up to 180+cm right? lol... yeah... these are ALL my long-term goals... i am hoping i won't give up halfway... i have to bold this day's blog up so i won't forget about it...  "一时的放弃，一生的忏悔"

      OMFG... the movie "Brotherhood" is damn freaking nice man... i'll recommend it to everyone i know... i hope in the future more movies like this will be firmed again man... the storyline is so good... touching too... and the war effects are very realistic... and the last point is that it shows the cruelty of war... both parties suffer, especially the soldiers and the civilians, while the head of the countries which started the attacks rest and relax at the office... damn them... nice show again, i must say... hehe... last but not least, both the chio bu are really chio... but a pity they only act for a short time...  as the movie progressed, i realised Won Bin is really damn handsome man... tanned... and got the looks... a fine body shape as well... i am aiming to be like him... so i am gonna exercise till i am near that stage... haha! they say Zhang Dong Jian is more handsome than Won Bin... but i dun think so leh... he might look more macho lar coz he bit older and mature mah... if i am a girl... i would choose Won Bin as my idol instead, rather than Zhang Dong Jian... but all in all... they both did damn well in the movie... acting skills, expressions... all are great... hope the same director for this movie would produce even better or at least the same standard as "Brotherhood" and then show in singapore... coz i realised got many shows from other countries singapore nv show one... except those super famous ones such as spiderman 2 and harry potter and such...

      hmmm... spent 2 hours with wei xian and ker yun (my sisters! dunno how i end up as their bro one oso) and did homework... haha... rarely these kind of things happen to me, but it did! so i finished the homework and happily went home... well... it's quite seldom since i spent such a long time with pple whom i only knew for 2 weeks and behaved as if i knew them for years... the feeling's so great... and they are BOTH gals somemore... a bit knowing how to socialise liao... great... =)  but... at the same time... life's getting pretty empty and dull... those days we spent time on programmes which we used to enjoy are almost extincted, and we are living in our own world now... sounds pessimistic? maybe... but at least the mind is telling me this lar... i missed my secondary life... truly madly deeply... but i know this can't get me to anywhere coz time cannot go back... am oredi feeling the loneliness of an adult liao... sad man...

      gl just said he just broke... 4th time... he's really  an unlucky one... well he told me now he realised the value of true friendship... "one fault, one thing realised"... sounds appropriate now to me... i noticed that a long time ago, but still can hardly express myself that well... i am so ashamed of myself for being what and who i am... and i am still thinking of a word worse than "ashamed", coz it might mean more to me... there's still this thing... which is still blocking the passage of openness... still unrevealed... no one will understand it i guess... the simple reason being it is i dun understand myself either... when i dun, who ever will? few years back i thought this problem will sooner or later be resolved... who knows... after 5 to 6 years... it is still out there somewhere, hidden, and unnoticed... maybe i need some therapy to clear the doubt out? whatever....

      well poly started a few days ago... basically, my class ar... a bit quiet lar the boys... so made me quiet too... 7 boys to 15 gals, quite a ratio... overwhelmed by gals... haha.. but better than my friends lar... with 1 gal and 20+ boys in EEE... haha... hmmm anyway... for now it's quite bored to stay in class... we are not united yet... but i sincerely hope for a change in the times to come... when can i myself be an extrovert?  well.. i really missed the sec 4 and the holiday period... that's the time when hanming,guanlin,weisheng,benjamin,eugene,shenlin and me going out almost everyday without fail... go KTV blah blah and even at times when we so sian we even go directly to a void deck to talk cock... missed those days... really... but a few weeks before the poly started... hm and gl got themselves a gf... lc began to feel ostracised... ben and gene indulging in their jc lives.. sl working like a machine... then only left me and ws... yea... few common topics between me and him... so the time we spent outside is lesser.. and now since the poly started and everyone went in a different course as each other... we merely met up... and even if we did, the most is around an hour's time... or maybe lesser... perhaps it's time to "change" to another group or so... now i know why all those who are older than me faced the "group-separation"... it's because it's really something very hard to keep with... i won't know how long this thing will last, but i certainly cannot bare to let the friendship go just like this... i dunno about the others, but i'd really cherished every moment we had together... and i hope they felt it too... good luck in my future endeavours man...

      the committee members of my class and a few others spent so much of their sweat on the programme for DCP day which was a dance lar... samuel and danny still very determined with their "no" which made the whole plan fall apart... i really dunno why lar... can't they be on a bit for that day only? it's not as if we need to perform every week or every month or wad... it's only once a year, and next year we'll be all different class... count themselves as guys somemore... even the girls so on liao... they like kids lydat, so naive... especially that samuel... the notoriously known as the bo chap king... danny must have been influenced by him a lot lar... the danny few weeks ago is not himself anymore... i have no ideas what they are thinking of.. to join in the dance so difficult meh? it's not as if they are dancing solo... it's the whole group... haizz... forgot there will be some anti-social people one lar... i oso dun wan to care so much... i be myself and i am already contented with it... too busy with my own life to intervene others... haha... anyway, got a pathetic 33/40 marks for the CP4001 test... careless lar... if ppm things i had listened to what the teacher had said i shld have gotten full marks... haha... "if"... nvm lar... next paper will try to strive harder... time to get on with exercising too... this few days i have no time for jogging and such... but if got time i definitely must go liao... got input no output really very jia lat... oredi got a bad comment from one of my classmates liao... sigh... it is that significant ar?

      went to swimming pool early in the morning to cook my skin a little... though not much difference... but if one day got difference no one will be white liao... went marina bay with the gang except sl who's not free and had a feast there... buffets... something that i will not ever touch if there are no really important occasions... pay $$ to stuff my stomach and torture myself and gain weight oso... sigh... worst thing that could happen... when resting for a while during the buffet, went to the bowling area with hm and watched... talked for 1hour 15mins... ard there... not talk actually... was complaining about tons of things... i didn't knew that i could complain that much... and somehow regretted complaining that much...what's the use of complaining anyway? it's a short-term "feel-better" effect but there's a danger for the future at the same time... ok lar, most probably that will not ever happen... not going to talk abt that anymore... anyway, $3.90 for one game of bowling is... cheap -.-... siao one... how can we children ever afford it... bleah... signing off, bad things corrupting my head again...

LOL... the dream's still there... ok lar anyway... was planning to skip ah leung's lesson... but that ky took my bag and even went into the females... so in the end went for the lesson lor.. lucky got go, coz for once i finally listened to leung's lesson :p... even jia hui said i wear contact lens look better... i want to wear it leh... but my eyes dun allow me so... few hours tired like hell liao... dunno something wrong with the lens or my eyes... coz the optimist oso said my eyes are dry from one look... and those who have dry eyes will surely have disadvantages in wearing contact lens... but i think xi guan jiu hao lar... must xi guan... at least now putting and taking out of the lenses isn't much of a problem now/.. from 30mins cut down to 10mins... lol... hmmm... was thinking of throwing the present contact lens and open new pair... my right eyes cannot tahan the present one... i hope it's the fault of the lens and not my eyes... lens can change but my eyes are permanently there... haha... tml going marina bay... will try to cut down on the food... must adept to eating slowly and less in quantity... if not really hopeless... tml going swimming pool to tan myself a bit... my face just look... sissy -_-... my stomach is actually darker than my face sia... dunno got what pigments in my face that will remove tanned skin... zzz... strange enuff... haha... tata for now...~

      i will not doubt everything then. just feel that everything's not all right, in fact, not right at all... dunno how to explain it... but the atmosphere totally sucks... guess? nah... another imagination will arise if that's the case... well... forget it.  anyway, went to Giant and bought 2 fans. 1 of them being the lousier one and the promoters are promoting it... kena faked... luckily my dad there... bought 1 instead of 2 of the same sucky fan... this is when experience comes in handy... anyway, try not to believe in promoter's words lar.. if there's a chance
