      omg last nigt i was at gabbys house and me and her and cassie and erin and jake and chris all went for a walk then these three black guys come up and push through us and decide that they r gonna walk with us. then they start to hit on erin and they grab her and mentioned something about tappin that and they were checking me and cassie out and ...they left jake alone cuz they liked his hat! but chris is like so awesome... he was talkin to them and tryin to distract them from us the whole time. and if he wasnt there then god knows what would have happened to us...but then this car pulled up and they started talkin to the people inside thats when i got really scared cuz i thought more people were gonna get out. so we went into someones backyard that had people in it and told them so some of the adult guys go out there and get the license plate number and call the cops then the guys leave...and it turns out that those guys have been breaking into people houses have held a boy up at gunpoint and walked up and punched an 8 year old boy in the face for no reason! those little bastards! they threatened to kill chris as they were leaving too...and if we didnt go to that persons yard chris would prolly have ogtten jumped and us girls prolly would have gotten raped! im just glad everyone is alright and thank god that chris was there!!!!! but anyways other than that jake and gabby go out! ...again this is their 3rd time. i made gabby promise me that if it doesnt work out this time that she wont try again becuz really after 3 times its not gonna work ever! so yeah and um....ed that little bastard broke up with cassie and wont tell her why...actually wait he didnt break up with her he jhad lee do it! and then he told cassie that he still wants her and then he goes and tells erin that hes lookin for someone new! that little whore!ugh.....but anyways that about it i guess......ok bubi now     listening to: bush-glycerine
