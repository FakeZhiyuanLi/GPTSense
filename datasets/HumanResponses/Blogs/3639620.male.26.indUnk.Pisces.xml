						   I Think that I am getting a little bit behind with all this.......................  17th, June, 2004 - 1:30am  Back in work again - - - - - FUN.....  But how cool is this years Big Brother.. How cool is it getting, now that there all running out of cig's.. I know its tight not letting them have more. But it is helping to make compelling viewing & I suppose that's what Channel 4 intend in achieving this year. Hence the Evil tag.. I know it started out shit hot. Each contestant slightly being the opposite of one another etc. Then after a day or two it didn't at all seem that way. But now, it's all starting to come together.. Will those two dizzy knobheads come out from that secret room any time soon. Just to really kick off with Victor, Jason & any of the others that get in the way? Or could the others beat them to it?? Do you think there is a possibility that Kitten could return. Just to turn the tables & cause yet more riff's within what already is a small enough house?? There are hundreds of possible things that could happen. Which I do think Channel 4 will pull out the hat, some time soon. More viewers are switching on all the time & the more that do turn on. The better it seems to get..... So well done Channel 4 & the big brother crew. I know the late night show is helping me stay awake during my night shift. Also keeping me from doing any work. Which I class as a good thing.. Lets just hope it gets better as the time goes on? So to all the wankers in the house.. "Keep it up". I may just have to log on the web site once I finish work. Just to get my fix (bloody hell, how sad am I getting). Well as long as it stops me sitting there gorping at a blank screen which is doing absolutely fuck all. Which is a good thing & so I'm proud of being one of the many (well sort of) Big Brother devotees...  There goes the alarm again in one of the rooms. So I'll be back soon.................  The moaning old sod. He had rang his alarm only to tell me that his pillow had been the wrong way round! How can a pillow that is the same on both sides, be the wrong way round? Because I don't have a clue?! Sometimes when it is warm at night & you turn the pillow over, it is nice. Just to find out that it's lovely & cool.. But that wasn't the case. These are some of the silly things that we have to put up with at night. I know it cant be helped. But sometimes it calls us away from more important things.. Sod it. I am going for a fag & a some fresh air. OH & kill this big, black hairy fucker of a spider which is running across the carpet.. FUCK HOW I HATE THE BLOODY THINGS. Plus the crunching noise you hear when you step upon them, can sound nice..  While deep in thought outside. Miles away in a far away galaxy. Thinking about how nice that big double duvet would feel smothering me right now... It suddenly dawned on me that the nurse I have to work with tonight. Does not like the staff to go sit in the lounge, on one of the many, nice, cozy armchairs. He makes you sit near the office, on one of those hard plastic chairs. The kind that you once found in schools when you were younger. You know the type? I understand why we do have to sit out there. Near to the office. It is a little easier to hear everything going on & also giving you a better view of all the corridors.... After a few hours, sat on one of these things. Your bum starts to get quite numb. Your legs begin to wonder off to sleep. No matter how many times you get up, walk about, go for a fag, or go to do one of the rounds (every 2 hours or so). Your backside knows that you've to return. You never really recover from that strange numbing feeling that carries on well after the walk home.. Long after a quick smoke, a shit & a cold can of beer. Yes I know its only 8 in the morning. No I am not an alcoholic.. It's a good way to relax once I get home. Well think of it this way. Most people finish work, go home & open a bottle of wine, or whatever.. Well that is all I am doing.. You have to think that it is my night time.... I just hope that one day, my mum doesn't catch me supping one. Bugger knows what she would say or do... Well back to those plastic chairs & my numb bum. It's not till you awaken well into the afternoon. That the slight feeling of constipation starts to depart.  Only for the fact that once I've eaten my breakfast (it's my morning remember), had a shower, shit & a shave. A quick, but slow & long relaxing smoke. I have to go back to work, to sit on those horrible plastic chairs once more. Although on the walk up to work. I do try to remember who it is that I have to work with. Hoping that it isn't Tony. That it's someone else (I can dream). It is not till I turn the corner along the long drive way going in to work, see his clapped out Burgundy Ford Escort parked near the entrance. That my rear starts to cringe with fear, of yet another night of numbness caused by the bloody chair... Right, well as I had being saying before I rudely interrupted myself.. When Tony is working downstairs with you. He doesn't allow you to sit in the lounge, on one of the nice cozy armchairs. This means that I cant get my fix of big brother.. So I just have to have a wonder up the stairs. With a glimmer of hope that they could be watching the telly. Which they normally are & to the chance that Channel 4 is switched on?  I think I'll go to have another ciggy & then take my chances upstairs...  This home that I work in. This nursing home which I help to care after 60 elderly people, all with dementia, alzimers. Well the company really does make me laugh. The company which owns over 90 similar homes all over the country. Anyway. There was an article in The Independent newspaper not so long ago. Babberling on & on about the need for all these immigrants which are currently flooding our hospitals & homes. & the need to help staff all or most of the country's staffing problems, due to the fact that no-one is willing to come work in them.... Well Westminster have recently employed 80 people from Poland. Payed for the flights & give them 4 months rent to help them out. We currently employ Nurse's & career's from Bulgaria, Romania, Africa & some from the Philippines. Well anyway, the article mentioned that no-one is willing to work in homes anymore. For what ever stupid reason they gave.. It went on & on about all this for 2 pages. All about giving them training -     BLAH     BLAH     BLAH.... Although they did some how forget one simple thing.... The reason why they cant get any staff working within Westminster homes. The simple fact is that Westminster pay bloody terrible wages... I mean terrible. Almost pathectic. Who in this day & age can afford to work for a measly 4.60 (English pounds) an hour. YES, I know I am, but I'm one of the few that does not mind that much. One of the few that enjoy the job. Care about the people I look after. It really does not matter if the staff are good or bad. For some unknown silly reason we can not leave.. Then Westminster have the cheek to start paying anything to & above a pound more an hour for this foreign care staff. Which they have just payed the cost of them getting here, training, English courses at the local Collage. But then we get some cock & bull storey that they will not, can not give us anymore pay. Unless the minimum wage goes up, then they are able to? Although these people come over here, doing the same good as me. Having maybe never doing this kind of job before. Then pay them a lot more.. It really does PISS me off. It doesn't bother me that they may have come here to escape poverty, war. It is the simple fact that this money driven company (Westminster Health Care), are willing to pay them all more. The money that they have spent on flying them all here, help them all out in accommodation for 4 months (which is far from cheap around here). Couldn't the company use this money in different ways. Like more equipment for use in the home, More facility's for the residents & possible better wages. Better wages would pull in better staff, so they wouldn't have the need to import staff from a country far, far away. It all makes sense to me. But to the suits high up there in the big flash car's, It doesn't. As long as the job gets done, in whatever way, does it matter. No.. Or the fact that these staff don't speak much English. The people I care for can't understand me or the other staff to well, due to there condition. So the confusion from listening to the foreign staff, must be hard. I do feel sorry for the old dears. & I do in some silly way, feel sorry for the staff brought over here. They come here with a promise of a better life. Loads of money. Better living. Being able to send loads of money back home to there family's. Tell them that they will be doing this & that once they arrive. Then to be thrown into the deep end... Not given much help with anything... They cant go home, which a few would like to & have done. All because they had to sign a 2 year contract, which is there green card. The heads of the company do not really care much. They all see the job being done. The bills being paid, which is over 500 pounds a week for each resident living here (there are 60 people living here) & this is not the poshest home Westminster own. They do make a lot of money. Hell... They don't give a monkeys. It isn't them which has to deal the family's complaining & getting upset, when the mother or father is being looked after by some rude, incompetent member of staff, who cant even speak the English language very well. When every single member of staff of shift is foreign. Then when I come back to work later that day, it's all up to me to sort out & clear up all the silly mistakes that have been made though out the earlier shift. The nurse's have to deal with someone who maybe getting sores due to being sat in their own feces & urine all day long. Just because the staff can not be bothered to see to them... You may sit at home watching these programs about ill treatment that goes on within our Nursing homes. You may sit in disgust. But when you have to work in some of these conditions. Knowing there isn't to much that you can do about it all. Knowing that if you complain, nothing will probably be done about it. Knowing that there is more chance of me getting the sack or being shown were the door is. Than there is for them. Knowing that there are yet more foreigners on the way next month. So they all don't give a fuck... All the staff could leave, but they will be replaced by someone... But this ill treatment isn't just being caused by these foreign members of staff. But it does make up for a large percentage of it. & more being the kind that goes unnoticed due to residents illness & the fact it could be an accident or has been brought on by causing harm to themselves in one way or another. But as long as me & a few hundred other career's still go to work in these homes, underpaid, understaffed, overworked (working 13/14 hour shifts). As long as we come in & try our hardest to do the job we are paid so little to do. Then maybe we can try to make a difference. Maybe make these people's lives a little better than what they already are. If just only for the sake of the family, who never really come to terms with there parents illness... We can & do make a difference. We do at times deserve a pat on the back. We do deserve that holiday we have struggled to save for.......  (Time for another fag before the round...)  Well that must have been one of the quickest rounds yet... Is it a good thing or bad thing that it didn't take to long? The next round will tell....  Now bloody hell I've got a mammoth of a spot under my bottom lip. It's small & sore. One of those spots that sticks out a mile, even though its not very big. I BLOODY HATE THEM. I used to get them all the time. Used to. If I'm lucky, it's just the odd one now. I think it's through work, all the germs & crap floating around. Well I think it is... Some spots you don't mind. They go just as fast as they arrive. People don't notice them as much. But it's the  other kind.. One's with the big heads on them. Look sore as hell. You know the type. The one's you just need to pop in front of the mirror, just to see how far the puss will fly... I know that I should leave them alone, sometimes you just can't help it. I will leave this one. I promise... Hopefully it will have gone by Thursday morning, before I get on that plane. The only problem is that it's where I shave. So I'll have to make sure that I'm extra bloody careful... Anyway talking of planes & flying. I'm really starting to look forward to Portugal. I think it'll be a lot of fun. I've never been there before, so I have no idea what to expect. Apart from the sun that is & my tan could do with a top up. Plus it'll be a little warm-up for lanzarotte next month, with Linda, Rick, Helen & her kids. Which is definitely going to be an experience. Never have I thought I would be going on holiday with anyone else's children. Apart from my own. Which I don't see my self having for some time... I'm just glad that we have our own Villa, with what looks like a rather large private pool. It is set back from the main road, not to far from all the bars, but just far enough away for loads of peace & quiet. Though having Helen's children there is a dornting feeling. Although I'm starting to think that it will not be that bad. I' still going to get my own space & in a way, we all will. I suppose we are all going to get our fair share of looking after George (the youngest child). Lucky we all do get on. So it'll be fine. I shouldn't worry. I am still going to get my time with Linda, which I am really looking forward to. We haven't really been away with each other before, well. Apart from the odd weekend somewhere, just not a week. Luckily we both know we can live under each others feet for a week. We managed quite well baby sitting Helen's house the time they went away. I just hope Lin can manage living with me, this time around... The hot sun. Me & my drinking. Though over the years, it has got less & less. I just can't hack it anymore (getting old I think). But I am sure she will be sat by my side in the bar's, drinking just as much as me. If not more.. I have already been away. Last month, a week in Wales. It may not be to everybody's taste, especially not a 26 year old. But I enjoyed it. It was a relaxing break away with my dad. Which I think he enjoys, only for the simple reason he hasn't seen to much of me over the years. Well since before my parents divorced. He thinks that he has let me down in some way or another. He has explained once or twice, why he feels he let me down & I do understand. I just don't think he should feel so strongly about it all.. It is not his fault. A lot is down to me. I control my own life.. I know I have not made the best of it so far. I do hope to change this all soon. But I do worry with the fact he thinks this way... It is really nice to speed a week with him. Even if I do get on his nerves with my fussiness & me laziness. But that is me, I can't change that. He just puts up with it & I am proud of anyone that can do that. Especially my mum & stepdad. Who over the years, has put up with a lot. I know I can be a real bastard at times. & before I forget. I need some more underwear & a few other bits for Thursday. So that means I am not going to get any sleep in the morning. I will just have to make sure I get an early night. I know I can not though. Linda is coming round. I really don't think she wants to hear me snoring from 7 o' clock. Especially since we haven't seen to much of each other recently, also I may not get to see her to much over the next week & I'm going away. So I'm going to be miles away from her. I know I'll be missing her terribly. I am already. Sometimes it just can not be helped, we both work long shifts. Her through the day, me at night. So its inevitable that we can not see each other as much as I would like. We have to live with it, even if we don't want to. Hopefully it will not be for to long. As we are planning to move in together soon. Maybe once we get back from the holiday next month. So I am just going to have to make the most of tomorrow afternoon & through the night. But make sure I get my backside to the barbers in the morning.. I know that she doesn't appreciate sitting there, while I have funny shapes cut into my hair. She panic's In case my haircut gets a little to drastic, which one day will. So she patently waits with nerves of steel, one eye half shut. Hoping that it does not happen in the near future. Although tomorrow I will be having something slightly different done, compared to what I already have done. Just not to sure what yet. But I am sure that me & the barber can come up with something. Well, it needs to be done & before I go on holiday... It is now 5:30 in the morning. My brain is feeling like it is wasting away. I can't think, let alone write anymore. Although I am sure something will pop into my head before to long. It is bloody freezing out here.  I am quite shocked that I haven't smoked to much tonight. It was all I seemed to do the other night. My lungs went numb. So it is a good thing that I have give them a break.. Well I have had my last tuna fish buttie, my umpteen packets of crisps & by heck, I am still bloody starving. Also very sleepy, so I think a nice cup of coffee is needed. 2 sugars & a drop of milk. That should keep me awake, hopefully till at least 8. When I may be able to at last get some sleep. Even if it is only for an hour or two.......................................  So good morning......................

						   It was 1:30 tuesday morning. I've been stuck in this building since 9 o' clock last evening. But for what feels or seems forever..... Why did i choose to go on nights? Maybe, to retane my sanity? Maybe to loose everything? Maybe hell knows?! How do i know & how would hell know?? Is hell ment to know all? Because i'm buggered if i know or care......... Well anyway. Working nights, i suppose has to be better than working through the day in this fuckin morbed dump of a place........ I say that. Just sometimes i do wish to be back working through the day again. Being able to sleep at night once more. Being able once more to enjoy the sunshine through out the day.. Instead i have to sleep in it... Well. Sort of sleep during the day. Because it aint that easy. I dont think it is anyway. People do manage. I just dont - but it'll probbly come in time... So while i wait for sleep to over come me. i can normally find myself sat staring deep into a flickering, flashing 15" monitor. Waiting for some useles file to finish downloading... Files which i may never, ever use..... But you never know..... One day i just may need them??? So while i sit, waiting, hoping that i may just need the use of them... I need more space apon my hardrive.... I need to buy yet more room. Which is pointless. BUT I HAVE TO HAVE IT....  I Dont have to work on Wednesday night anymore... I managed to blag my way out of it... Which is a good thing. Seen as I'm going to Portugal early thursady morning & i realy didn't fancy leaving work to go straight to the airport.... Plus i would have spent the next 3 days, trying to catch up with my sleep. I dont think Rick would appreciate it. Me being knackered all the time we are there. Seen as though he is paying for it all. Well i think he is. He says that he isn't & that he got the holiday free from work.. Which i can beleive. But for some reason i just cant......! But the worst thing is. He said i didn't need to take any money... & that he'll pay for drinks etc. I know the hotel is half board, so at least i will get to eat something. But some gut feeling, tells me that he hasn't or wont have enough money to carry us both... & thats whats really starting to bother me. What if he hasn't enough money..... Because i haven't & feel rude asking someone if i could borrow some. As i owe my mum 100 quid & i need to give Lin 90 quid towards the car (& i dont think that i have it). Its just the little things like having enough to buy a drink or 2. Or a packet of fags... Rick told me not to bother about that. He kept telling me that at the time he booked the seats on the plane. But now he doesn't.. It's like he has forgot he said it. Or just presumes that i will take some money, seen as he saw me spend loads the other week...... Bugger knows if i know what to do....? At least i'm guaranteed a good few drinks at the airport. Rick the fucking star (he can be sometimes), has booked us two in to the V.I.P lounge in the airport. So we get free drinks (i hope). Ohh.... I have got some money. I got 20 quid that my dad gave me the other day for something... Which i haven't used. So i can take that, which i'll use to buy 200 cigs once i'm there...... Well if i cant drink myself to an early grave, i can at least smoke till i'm breathless.. And While we are over there, England are playing the second game of the UEFA cup.. I just hope they atleast win. Or Draw. I really hope they dont loose AGAIN. Like they did with France. I think we are not to far from the staduim in Portugal that the game is being held in. Which is a good thing. Least we know there will be a good atmosphere... As long as there isn't any fights etc. I think we'll be alrite. I'll just have to come to terms with the fact i have no money to take. Apart from the 20 in my pocket......................... Well I'll keep my fingers crossed that there may be some in the bank that i hadn't accounted for..... (I CAN HOPE)  Ok. I'm goin having a cig before the round starts & to get away from these to moaning buggers that i have to work with. Dont get me wrong, i do enjoy working with Joan & jacque.... But they dont half do some bloody whining. & i thought i was bad... Well Kingsize Mayfair cigarettes... HERE I COME............................
