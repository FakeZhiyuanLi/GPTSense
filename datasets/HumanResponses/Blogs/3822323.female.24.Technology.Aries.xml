      The ongoing saga of decorating...  Hopefully by the end of this week it will be done. We have painted the living room. Well, Abi did it, I left patches so she is giving my side of the room a second coat....  I have been reduced to giving the skirting board and the archetrave a coat of primer - and nothing else! I am however still expected to clean all the brushes at the end of the day, even when I have not painted! The injustice!  Dad is down this weekend to help tile the kitchen - he has the know how, and more importantly all the tools.  I will, when its all done, post some links and photos on my website.  urlLink visit me   ciao

      To all you shoppers out there!  My story begins late last night.....  I spent a considerable amount of time going around the Sales and was totally dis-heartened to return with only one item! I battled the crowds and I rummaged with the best of them but dissapointment was my only purchase.   This poor display of sales techniques questioned my feminimity. What happened to that savy woman of not so long ago? Well I set out this lunch time to find her and find her I did. Horray!   There were bargains to be had and by golly I bought them all. Whether the items will inevitably be worth the financial heart ache is not a question we should ponder on too heavily. Besides a bargain is a bargain and I have not met a red blooded woman that can resist the draw of those bright red Sale signs!  Now before the wave of shoppers guilt envelopes me and resentment towards these new additions to my wardrobe consumes me, I would briefly like to pay hommage to my favourite items:  1) The tan suede shoes - may you forever reside by my heel. 2) The brown silky halterneck - always will you be my sexy little friend. 3) The cardigan too big for me - may you shrink in the wash.  With that over with I would like to make a plea to the man in my life (Hi Lover!)....don't berate me for my frivolity. When the monetary burden strikes down on me, don't dismiss me, hold me and help by filling this gaping hole in my my wallet. That is all I ask!  Until the next shopping trip....happy shopping!

      Post number 1 on my first blog.  Currently at work down on the south coast of the UK. It's July 2nd and its freezing down here - here being Titchfield, Hampshire, center of the Universe.  I don't really know what to say at the moment, I was surfing the parts of google that I have never been too - yes i'm that bored - and i found this blogging malarky.  Expect to find lots of rambling on here in the future.  laters.
