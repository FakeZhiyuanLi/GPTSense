      excuse me.excuse me. i forgot to mention that i love this. a blogger what a novel idea as kitkat would say.  and excuse me. i realize there's smethng u may not know about me. i'm a writer. a real one. well, i know you can't tell frm these heah posts. but i is! official.  giving a writer a place to rant is an Archway to my homie cookie. pleaz! with that said i shall become my own god now. that's all writing is. a divine tendency. which is why the ability to read is essential to freedom. writing is self knowing self. enuf to tell smeone else about theyself!! homieonthehomefront cookie theorized, quite accurately i might add, that l.boogie's current state of confusion is cause she's running away from her own genious. her-self. boom! dig the equation:  god divided by creating=writing=freedom=self=beautiful ain't it?

      It's 5:55 on the AM. I ain't got no business being up but I ain't been to sleep yet. Writing, thinking, trying to find my soulhome.  And this is all I know:  I live this dream and somehow I find my visions unreal.   This being my first blog composition, I'll keep it like a snack.  I'm dedicated to learning. Clark ain't taught me much yet, but El Azteca in the sun did today: Most dayz I leave the house looking more than a painting. Cause I believe in style as a means of motivation and expression. Motivate innovation and you've freed a mind, dig. But I'm politicin' with a fellow younGod about folks staring at me all the time. Being-of-light he seen my plight and was like 'such is the life of mavericks'. I couldn't feel it at the time, lovin my personal bubble the way I do. And you know how you can always feel eyez on you? El Azteca in the sun wasn't nuttin new.  KitKat & Cookie was on the scene, loungin loverly. We ready to sip Coronas and appreciate melted cheese. KitKat got in my mind, 'what are they lookin at?' I was getting that ol' itchy feeling and went with my reflex; I got loud. 'i don't know. but i'm sayin they need to! ...befo' i! ...' By the time my chicken enchilada was before me I felt oxymoronic. What is inspiration without vision? I been illin' over the very thing I'm supposed to be for.   If I'm the star I claim, then I gotta be cool wit shinin.   My beef was my own belief. I live this dream and somehow find my visions unreal. But what's mo' real than me?  IN OTHER WORDS...If you gon' do it, don it.

        GoldyLocks & Candy. Officially    When we first met I was a mere 18 to his 40 years. He owns a music store,Rhythm, down the street from the all girls' college I attended. When I first saw him I thought of the caramel in a Twix. We would talk for hours, me lounging across the counter, lipgloss shinin, talkin Jay-Z and feminism. Sometimes I'd stick around until closing time & he'd offer me a ride back to campus. We'd sit in his vintage Bronco until the stars started blinkin. Once I pointed out my freshman dormroom window, he said, "Oh, so that's where I throw the peebles." Our flirting was clandestine and innocuous, the perfect accompaniment to an unspoken and mutual attraction. We'd go on semi-dates and he'd attend events I hosted on campus. Then came the hateration. Being that he was the only consistant cuteness within walking distance of campus & the provider of urban tunes, several brownies at my white-washed college craved his dirty drawers. Some caught on to us and not-so-casually-or-nicely confronted us about it, individually. Goldylocks thought it best that we cool it so as not to lose any business. I was hurt but acquiesced none the less.   Time went on (like 2 years)...I left school, visited Rhythm less and saw him less than that.    Then one day we went to the movies, our first date since I left school. It was great! We didn't want it to end so we picked up some beers, a blunt and went to hang with my roomie AlmondLaRoc & her grrlfriend BelleLaBalls. Between smoke & spirits I revealed my undying love for GoldyLocks to Almond & Belle as he went outside to retrieve smething from the car. "I think he thinks he's too old for me but, I just want him so bad & for so long!" When Goldy came back he had a couple & smoked a lil'. "I heard what you said when I left. I don't have a problem with our ages. We can do this if you want." There it was, the open door. Suddenly, I felt panicked and trapped! What could we possibly be to each other: me, a serial neo-polygomist with hopes of children before age 30; he: a 40+ DJ/store owner with no desire for a wife or kids, ever. Would a relationship destroy our 4 year friendship? And if it did, where the hell would I buy my music then?!  Me: "I'll be leaving ATL at the end of the summer."    Goldylocks: "What?! Why?" Me: "Um, it's just time." Goldylocks: "Well, we gotta hang out before you leave for good."  We went to see Dogville, an obscure yet original film starring Nicole Kidman. Drinks afterwards. I was on a celibacy kick & loathing myself for it. Goldy was looking fine as ever over the rim of my coke&rum. I had made a decision: I was gonna get wit Goldy before I left the city. He was dropping me off & came in to use the bathroom. This was my chance. All nite I was mulling over what the hell I was gonna say. I've never been a very good seductress.   Goldy: "Thanks. I thought I wasn't going to be able to hold it." Candy: "No problem." silence. Candy: "So that was a great film." Goldy: "Yeah, really well made." silence. Candy: "So...we'll have to do it again sometime soon." Goldy: "Definitely." silence. Goldy: "Well. Give me some love and I'll leave." long long hug. the pull away. and i go for a kiss on the cheek. he responds to my lips directly. WE KISS FOR A LONG LONG TIME. Goldy: "I've been waiting to do that for 5 years." Candy: "Yeah, me too." kissin kissin kissin Goldy: "Just tell me if you want me to leave." Candy: "I don't want you to leave." kissin kissin kissin Candy: "Do you want to make love to me?" Goldy: "You know I do." heavenly ascent upstairs to Candy's bedroom. the door closes behind us.  the end.

       "It's been a long time. I shouldna left you without a dope beat to step to..."   so here... Recently over cranritas with Homeboy&KitKat at my favorite bar ElMyr to subject of demeanorsandsuch arose. KitKat: "You're a bitch". Now, I'm used to hearing this & have come to accept it to some degree. I don't mind really. Love me or leave me, fah real. So this post is  DEDICATED TO MY FELLOW SO-CALLED BITCHES . "Fuck em grrl, fuck em, fuck em grrl, fuck em" Cause see I figured it out. People scared. Scared to be themselves, scared they ain't enuf, and they scared to want to be more like us. I know cause I used to be scared too. Then I was like, "why?" See I'm committed to honesty, for myself and the world. Cause I been misunderstood --guess god ain't listenin to that prayer from no Ninas--tryin to be nice. Then I get trapped into false representations when I'm really like "Hell naw, that shit wasn't aight. Gimme my shit back!" Ya dig? So several new year's eves ago I was I figured that out that nice shit was way back. I mean, I'm southern but not a southern sidewalk, that hospitality only goes as far as my nerves will permit.   And for what? Futhermore, what is a bitch? It's become a very subjective term. mY bitchDome can be broken down in a short list of adjectives: audacious, brave, bold, dauntless & raw. And for those who know and love/hate me, I am divine + feminine = a DiVa! Stylin fine oh so divine...  diva: Italian, literally, goddess, from Latin, feminine of divus divine, god -- DEITY  I was born and raised this way, unabashedly might I add. Seems the general consensus is that being a bitch is something to be ashamed of or apologize for. That all depends on the totality of the individual. I can safely say I'm a sensitive bitch, caring and considerate of others BUT not at the cost of my conscience or consciousness. Fuck em grrl, at the end of the day it's all about truth. Feelings ain't got shit on that.

       Fallin Into Bosoms: Seasonal Semen  The weather's warmed up along with the bodies of earth. I am like most young fleurs, around this time of the year. SunStar explained it perfectly concerning a chance encounter she had with a gang of beautiful construction workers: "The pollen just does something to me; I mean, how can one not be affected with semen floating around everywhere?" Admittedly, more than the pollen has been doing something to me. Goldylocks and me created a spell to which I am bound. Doing nothing with my moments but reliving past ones of naked brown limbs wrapped around electric whispers. Damn. KitKat has been estranged from me for sometime seemingly due to the same semenal sabbatical. Her & Jumanji, so tender and wild. Meanwhile, my heart is flippin around trying to figure out its position. See...I'm not supposed to fall in love with my honeybee. It's forbidden in the established code of SPU (serial polygomists united; yes the pun is intended & deliberate). We just play birds & bees in the movies, not in reel life. So I'm wonderin, how do I turn off my heart's automatic pilot. He's my friend, he's friendly, fine, funny and we pollinate like the world's rarest must. Dammit. As a SP of SPU, I have long believed in the body's ability to participate in fornication's fabulousness without obligating the heart to the finality of monogamy. I believe a grey area of coolness exists in the often turbulent pool of pollen & petals. Surely, friends can fool around and remain logical. To hell with Hollywood and automatic pilots.

      Change is in the air so pack your bags, we're moving. The time and place are often shielded from our view but we can feel the ground rumble. Stagnation means death to the spirit.  But be forewarned, 'all movement is not forward and all change is not growth'. (Ellen Glasglow) Today I got some Buddhist 'wisdom energy' via my inbox that went something like:   We are not compelled to meditate by some outside agent, be it God or other people. We are responsible for our own suffering and our own cure. We have created the circumstances in which we find ourselves, and it is up to us to create the circumstances of our release.   The fucked up part is what do you do when you don't know how or what to change? I guess there's really no definite way of knowing what's best. Just hold your breath and jump with intuition in your back pocket.
