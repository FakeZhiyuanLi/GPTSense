						   So, Harry Potter Day has come and gone. I think I'll need to see the movie again before I make a final decision; right now I'm rather ambivalent. A few points:  What I didn't like: - Camera tricks that just looked cheap. Still no good CGI. OK, but not REALLY good CGI. - Not enough explanation about Harry's Dad, and how James' old friends ended up where they are now. They left out a few things that are going to be important later for background, and I'm not sure they were good decisions - No creapy Voldemort asides. Also, they left out the explanation of the Dementors and the Dark Side (used in that Star Wars kind of way). Also may be important later. - Guy who replaced Richard Harris was crap. Forgot his name, liked him a lot in Toys. - Not enough Quidditch. No Wood!  What I did like: - Hermoine punching Malfoy! That few seconds of film was SO worth the $10. It was everything I thought it should be. - Faster pace, and fewer classroom scenes. Those don't translate so well onto film. Although, as an aside, we aren't seeing nearly enough of Nevil(Sp?). - The guys who play Fred and George REALLY grew up. They're yummy. - Even with as much stuff as they took out, they were true to the spirit of the book.  My biggist problem is actually with a decision that I very much understand, but do not agree with. The movie is very obviously targeted to teens and young adults. Which makes sense, as they buy movie tickets. But this is a story about 13 and 14 year olds. The books become more mature as the characters do, and that's as it should be; I just think this movie went farther than it should have.  OK, now off to bed. Have to be up at 7 to volunteer. Nighty Night!

						   Well, Happy Hour Wednesday turned out to be interesting. No Ex, and the Boy only showed for about 10 minutes before running off to a work meeting, then to visit with Ex alone. Roommate K and AD and I left Happy Hour and headed over to the Neighborhood Pool Hall, where poor AD went on a bender which necessitated taking her out to the back parking lot to throw up, as she destroyed the bathroom.  Poor girl. We got her back to her place very late when she had stopped heaving, and stayed over to be sure she was OK. Roommate K left for work in the AM, I spent most of the day keeping AD company etc. then went to see the Boy who was working from home.  Hung around and had dinner with the boy, got home after dark. I was up at 7 this morning for reasons no one could describe, especially me. The door installers have been here since 8, which seems to me to be an exceptionally long time to install a door; but what do I know.  Tonight, great large group to Betheda for the third Harry Potter Movie. I've watched the first two movies and re-read the first two books this week in preparation. Great fun, should be a total blast. Especially looking forward to Hermoine punching Malfoy!  Woo Hoo; door installers just left. Now I shower, put in laundry, go to the store, come home to check on things, and go get my phone fixed. Stupid thing has conked out on me. The damn phone is brand new too; I've only had it two weeks or so. GRRRR. No clue what set it off; but if they say it's due to jostling I'll need to get a new purse. No way to avoid jostling and banging in my summer purse.  Well, I'm off. I'm sure I'll have to log on and review the movie later. Tah.

						   So, the Boy's Ex came into town tonight. Should be fun, especially if she comes to happy hour. Tomorrow night Roommate K and AD and I are going to the Democracy for America Happy Hour at Hawk & Dove. The Boy is supposed to bring her.  Right now, I am drinking entirely too much red wine and listening to the Chess soundtrack. Lovely musical. Love story, history lesson, and cold war leftover. And all revolving around an essentially dull board game! Also includes asides about colonialism and commercialization. Gotta love that. Great fun, especially the "Opening Ceremony", which includes the Arbiter's song, and the opening of the second act, more commonly known as Murray Head's 1980's pop classic "One Night in Bangkok".  In college when I needed a pick-me-up during a long night of studying, I'd listen to Chess (keep in mind I mean the original London Version here, not the crappy American Version), and the Alley Theatre soundtrack of Jeckyll & Hyde. The Broadway version is much inferior. Trust me. Do yourself a favor and find the original soundtrack. You'll thank me.  AW seems to be in the process of ignoring me, which I find vastly amusing as I came back early from my Grandmother's funeral in New England to throw her a graduation party she showed up late to, and then she forgot my birthday. Go figure that I'm the one IMing her and calling her and she's blowing me off. I don't know how much more I can really take. I understand that she's upset about the Boy and how much time I spend with him, but I told her from the beginning, if she needs me I'm here, just call or show up. And this was when I was working; I told her to come to my office if she needed me that badly. Her choice not to take me up on it, and to refuse about 100 invites to go out; now she's blowing me off.  Ah, "Nobody's Side". Excellent song, and just the mood I'm feeling.  Never be the first to believe, never be the last to deceive.  Words to live by.  Nighty Night. Gotta concentrate on the "Mountain Duet".

						   What I did today:  - Weeded Herb garden for an hour. Was disheartened over how little I had done. Stopped to take pictures of the mess. - Shower and breakfast and dish-washing. - Applied for 1 job on my stack, then checked the news online. I then checked everything else I could think of to check online and signed off. - Wrote and send card to Brother A. Went to put it in the mailbox, and found I had missed our Mail Woman. As a bonus, I got my Beatles CD. - Weeding, interrupted by rain and lunch. Snood.  Snoooood!   After this exciting day, I am still not done weeding, which of course means there is still Basil in the sink which should have been planted today. Sigh.  On the up side, I have not bought cigarettes, and I have not killed any dogs, cats, or chickens today. On the down side, I am not done with what I planned to do today, and I did not get the chance to go out.  Better luck with the rest of today, I suppose. Happy gardening!

						    So, nothing new today.   Except the chickens, which arrived late last night. FOUR to replace the one previous Chicken.  The weekend was an excellent time for re-focusing, for getting some reading and knitting done, and for being around people again, which after a week full of dogs and cat and dead chicken was nice.  Today, I am appreciating the glories of my own taste in music. Love the Boy, but an entire weekend of another person's music; well, it's like wearing someone else's clothes. It feels vaguely thrilling and illicit at first, then you just want your own clothes back or you will walk around naked  so help you god .  To Do this Afternoon: - Apply for the stack of jobs on my desk, which I was supposed to have begun at 1 this morning, when I finally shut off The West Wing and came in here to use the computer. - Clean out the hideously overgrown herb garden, trim back the Leaning Towers of Parsley, possibly plant the parsley seeds and just pull up the old plants (?) - Plant the basil which Roommate K so kindly brought back from the farm yesterday. She had an excellent weekend, BTW. - Wash the dishes which collected while I was away. Don't ask me when my not having a job made me chief cook and bottle washer, but there you go. - Find places to store various gifts for upcoming occasions until I need them. Write out cards for birthdays and Father's Day. Write and send Brother A's High School Graduation card. He's the last one. I only have 1 more cousin starting High School this year, other cousins and my bros are now out (and in the case of Brother J, married). Weird.  Well, TTFN. Live Long and Prosper. Who am I kidding; I'll post again today; I have nothing else to do.

						   Had a weird experience at about 2 this morning. Went into the kitchen to get water, and the window was just swarming with flies. It felt very Amityville Horror for a few seconds.  The most wonderfult thing about this Blog thing is that I can just freeform, pretty much secure in the knowledge that no one is reading (although I know JF has stopped by at least once). Helps with the massive writer's block I've been having the past few months.   Perhaps I cannot write effectively while happy. That's something to think about, especially if I choose to pursue this as a career. Not the blogging; no one journals on innane subject matter as a career. Well, ok technically newspaper columnists, but I've never had much interest in journalism. Also, they tend to work the "Issues of the Day" into their work.  I'm almost packed for the Farm this weekend, and feeling very glad that I decided to go. I was feeling the need to kick the dogs yesterday (which I thankfully resisted) so getting away will work wonders I'm sure. Two bathing suits for two days seems excessive, but I'm not up to trying them on today, so I figured I'd better bring two to be on the safe side. Also, if I just tan instead of swimming, that's a whole different suit. Before anyone jumps all over me with reminders about the receeding ozone layer, and the increased risk of skin cancer with each sunburn; I'd just like to say that I really don't care. I was a jaundiced baby, and I tend to become sanguine when I'm pale. I just flipping look better tan. Not only that, but I've spent too much time in my life worrying about what other people think, and being down on my looks. I love the heat, and the sun. I'm very tactile; I love the feeling of being drenched in sweat, I like wearing as little clothing as possible, I love the way sunlight smells, how it makes everything taste and feel better.  That was a really excessively long paragraph.  Seriously, there is nothing better than the warm sun; except being in the warm sun with someone who'se willing to lick the salty sweat off your body and fetch you cold drinks. I need a cabana boy in the worst way. Or maybe I just need to junk the serious fiction and write sweaty erotica. Either way.  Won't post again until Sunday or Monday, so I'll stop spilling my guts now, I suppose. If you get the chance, head to the water sometime this weekend. Even if it's only the tidal basin, or a local pool. Close your eyes, take a deep breath and smell the sun and the water together. There is so much possibility in that smell; so much hope and joy and so many good memories. At least for me. Enjoy!

						   So, had to do the dreaded "empty out my drawer and shelves at his place" today. Was planning to use his computer and do some meditation on the situation, but alas, Mr. Workaholic had taken the day off of work. So, there I was, stuffing shit into bags and all grumpy that I won't get to burn that CD for Roommate K before we head out to the Farm for the weekend. Stupid Boy.  Worst part is he's got this group of friends who I'm pretty sure don't like me (Social Anxiety, Social Anxiety) and he was on IM when I was there. Well, that's nowhere near the worst part. The worst part is going to be AW, who will give me the "I Told You This Was A Bad Idea Way Back in August" speech. And the fact that his timing is absolutely shitty. And the fact that he's cut himself off from me. And that I can't just go give him a big hug. Although, really, I couldn't do that before; he hated when I hugged him just because he needed a hug.  Today this is just consuming me, and I know nothing good will come from that. Still, a little wallowing has only landed me in the hospital twice before, so I'm sure I'll be ok. Today's motto is: Never get attached to lovers.

						   So, the Boy has decided we should just be friends for a while. We talked about it a little bit, and I understand his point of view. He's younger than me, he doesn't have the best track record with relationships, and he's a workaholic. He doesn't want to change, and he thinks I deserve better, so the best thing to do is split up now before either of us gets hurt so badly that it destroys our friendship. We've been great friends for over a year, and only dating for 5 months.  I'm a sad, sad woman. I love him, and he hurt himself a lot by making what he thought was the best decision for both of us tonight, and I can respect that as much as my gut tells me he's wrong, and as much as I hate facing being apart.   What I don't understand is allowing your head to lead your heart so much. I've been through Jefferson several times, and I truly believe that the best way to lead, both in politics and in relationships, is with the heart. The Boy believes in pragmatism above all else. He does not do or say anything that is not calculated. I seriously doubt that he's made any decision leading with his heart in a long time. I hadn't dated before him for several years after the messy breakup of a 5 and 1/2 year relationship. I took a big risk with my heart, and he knew that. I suppose that's why this should end here; part of me truly believes that we would have married and survived, while part of me agrees that we had no future together, and this is for the best. I guess that's my head and heart argument right now.

						   This is how my mother referred to Ronald Reagan when I was growing up. Keep in mind that I was almost, but not yet, 3 years old when the man was first elected President. For most of the first eleven years of my life, I was informed pretty consistently that Ronnie was evil. I've never liked the man very much, if only because I was  flipping  sick of hearing about what an ass he was.  I guess this is what kids born in 1990 or 91 with Christian Coalition parents heard about Clinton. That's a scary thought.   Anyway, the city is under siege today by visiting mourners. This will add to the usual congestion on the roads and the Metro. Not to mention that the summer tourist season is in full swing. As AW says regarding the plethora of visitors to our nation's capitol, "If it's Tourist Season, why can't we shoot them?"  I watched some of the coverage of the ceremony where they placed the body in the hearse to take to Air Force One. Since I've lost two grandmothers to Alzheimer's, I sympathize with Nancy and the various children; it's an awful disease. That said, the clips the news channels are showing in tribute just made me angry. You can say what you want about revisionist history; as far as everything I have learned over the years, the Cold War was for all intents and purposes over when Reagan came into office, at which point he riled it up again. Despite that fact, the man is getting historical credit for ending the Cold War. Gotta love US History; if we don't like what happened, we'll just make shit up.  Well, I just got a call from Roomate K saying that she's getting off of work early because of the funeral. I'm going out to meet her; braving the crowded Metro and the erratic mid-afternoon bus to the Metro. Today, in honor of The Great Communicator, if anyone asks you to win one for the Gipper, shoot them.

						    So, the past few days have been interesting.   First, in my ongoing quest to receive unemployment benefits, I got a call late Friday from the Unemployment Office saying they had questions. Keep in mind I filed a month ago, or more by now. Finally got hold of the woman Tuesday early afternoon, and it turns out my last employer, who I was with for the better part of a year, decided to try to screw me. Think I handled it just right though, so I'll know tomorrow if they're sending me money. If they don't, I'm going to have to go back to the last temp agency and grovel. Which I hate, although they'll probably take me. I just want to find a permanant job. Is that too much to ask?  In other news, MS called me last night to ask if I would come help with a fundraiser her office was holding on the Hill. Gig payed $50, so I said OK. Turned out to be a blast, although I believe I embarassed myself in front of a lovely Congresswoman whose husband I used to work for. Mr. Congresswoman has gotten some bad press lately, and I asked after him, and mentioned my association with him. Silly me. I felt like an ass afterwords. And of course, with my anxiety I just started shaking like a leaf after it occurred to me that I had embarassed myself. Damn chemical disorders! Chronic social anxiety just blows.  Feeling better about my ambivalent assessment of the Harry Potter film, as a friend who is at least as big an HP nut as I didn't like it at all.   Caught up with The Boy on my way home from the fundraiser; he was sitting in a bar with a couple we're friends with (CC and JJ) and popped out to grab me as I walked past. He gets plus 5 Good Boy Points for grabbing me, but in true my Boy fashion, immediatly lost 3 Good Boy Points for refusing to stay at my nice air-conditioned house while his AC is out of commission. Well, maybe only minus 2. I'll decide tomorrow, depending on wether our planned dinner in occurs here or there.  It's a late night for me, although not as late as some I suppose. Going to get outa here now and do naughty things, alone sadly. Young children, avert your eyes. Squirrel out.

						   So, I've been dealing with a huge excess of veggies all week. I've made a casserole, plans for potato salad tomorrow, and I just finished a batch of corn salsa. Had to throw away two more tomatoes from the Farm Stand today, which was sad.   The good news, of course, is that we won't be short of tomatoes for a long while, as our garden has started to produce small tomatoes already. We also have the first chilies coming in. Once again, sadly, the squash in our little garden didn't make it. Last year we got a few cucumbers, but sadly I don't think Roommate/Landlord planted any this year.  Had lunch with AW today, which was really nice as we haven't spent any significant time together in months. Had a good meal, picked up a few gifts at the Franklin's General store, and got coffee. It was nice. Her boy seems to be working out well, which is good. She's constantly ending up in relationships with losers, so it's nice to hear that things are going well. Wish I could say the same.  The nails of death (acrylic nails I got for Brother J's wedding over a month ago) are starting to break off, so a lot of time in the last few days has been devoted to filing etc. Annoying, but necessary. At least I'll be able to type more effectively when I go back to work.  Meeting Roommate K and AD for drinks and hanging out later, so I'm going to go file some more, then head out. Ciao!

						   The Trip to the Farm was a total blast. Friday we were treated to a car ride up, rather than the usual bus ride, and CD's were played at loud volume. That night we watched an old Cole Porter Musical on DVD (there was even a brief sing-along!) and made it an early night. Gotta love Cole Porter. The film we watched Friday was  Silk Stockings  with Fred Astaire. Another little gem of the Cold War. And yes, I am SO a product of my times.  Saturday we were up at 7:30 to set up the Farm Stand, which is about 10 miles from the house on a main road to Ocean City. We were out until 5, when we went home. The original plan was to rest, then drive out to Ocean City Saturday night. What we did instead was head out to a Mexican restaurant that had pool and Karaoke.  Sunday we were out all day as well, although K's Mom stayed at home and we ran the stand alone. Moved some furniture Sunday afternoon, then piled into the car with most of the leftover veggies and trucked on home. I woke up today with sore muscles from carrying crates of vegetables and playing catch for 2 days, but it was worth it.  Great fun, nice and relaxing, the best antidote I could have imagined to the hellish week I had last week. Today I've been putting up the leftover tomatoes for sauce and trying to figure out what the heck to do with the veggies. I made a zucchini and squash casserole, and I'm about out of ideas. There will be salad, of course; and we have about everything for pasta salad, potato salad, and blueberry pie. We will all be eating a lot the next few weeks.  I've been listening to the Oldies station all day, having a great time of it. Maybe it's a little superstitious, but I believe that food always comes out better when you cook to oldies. I prefer Motown and Do Wop, but I suppose Folk and 60's Pop works just as well. I've been hearing ads for the upcoming Tom Jones concert in the area, and I'm becoming jealous. Not that I'm a big Tom Jones fan, but it sounds like SUCH campy good fun!  Roommate/Landlord wants to bring his Boy out to the Farm when the tomatoes come in to pick them. AD also wants to come out one weekend, possibly bringing her Boy with her. My Boy never had an interest in going to help, or even just to chill out. No fun. Guess I'll just have to sit on that one. Haven't spoken to him since Thursday, when I went over to get stuff. Hope he's OK. I was furious, and I'm still angry and hurt, but I still want him to be OK. I'm such a sap.   Well, I'd better head to the store; I need more cheese for the casserole, and cigs. Hope Y'all have a good afternoon.

						   So, for my (record-breaking) third post of the day...  Found out tonight, much to my disappointment, that Roommate/ Landlord's flight leaves Sunday night, so there will be no trip to the Shore this week. In addition, AD has invited me to a party Saturday Night, which invitation I rejected as I thought I would be out of town. Must e-mail tonight and call tomorrow to see if the invite still stands. Could be fun; at very least, it'll be a distraction.  Been binge eating all of the junk food in the house. Sad state I'm in, especially since I've spent the better part of 3 weeks on the Peanut Butter and Jelly diet. Guess I'll just fix it tomorrow. Or, you know, eat more. Either way.  In short, the evening went from pathetic to depressing. Hopefully, tomorrow will be better. The plan as it stands is to wake up early and clean the kitchen and bathroom. Or, sleep late and mope. We'll see.  I hope that if someone somewhere is reading this, they find their lives less pathetic than mine. Glad I can can make someone feel better. Squirrel out.

						   So, cleaning dwindled throughout the day. Discovered a fun new game on Yahoo Games. Googled Gentile to see what types of hits I would get. Evidently someone named Sam has a blog in which he (or she) mentions their own name a lot. Lots of sites in Italian, which I kind of figured.  Having a low energy, low mood afternoon. Haven't cried yet today, but it's early. Bound to happen sooner or later.  Devoted a lot of time today to thinking about the Boy (this should shock no one). Still seeing the logic of all the people who say to let him come to me, let him work out whatever is going on then get in touch with me when he's ready. As K says, "Don't wait on him, but don't offer to take him back."   Although all of the above is logical, I'm scared that he's never going to get in touch with me. I hate the fact that I trusted him enough to let him hurt me. Should know better, based on past experience. All men leave eventually, just the way of my life.  Latah.

						   So far this morning I have:  - Continued cleaning under my bed, and reorganized my junk drawers. Threw out much additional crep.  - Thrown all of the Boy's stuff into a box for when he comes to feed the animals on Sunday. Very tempted to put in a note telling him exactly what I think of the books he lent me. I have no clue what he was thinking by lending me those 2 books in particular, but let's just say that his lousy taste in fiction lowered his stock about a million points in my eyes. I mean, really, I know he's not illiterate. No clue what that's about, and suppose I never will at this point.  - Continued the moving of wall decorations, and hung some which have been sitting in boxes for years. Threw away my Australian photo-collage, as I was uninspired by what I had, and I want to save the aboriginal art to possibly replace a battered Degas poster. Internal warring over said poster. It's a print of my favorite Degas Ballet painting, but it's old and battered and ripped and basically held to the wall by my will at this point. My musical posters remain in the closet, as I just have no room for them. Hung my MTA-NYC Subway Map instead.  - Seriously considered opening a bottle of wine I've had on my shelf for 2 years (the vintage is my last name, which makes me smile). Thought better of it. Will reconsider at some point.  Nothing terribly exciting, but it's not yet noon. Boredom something terrible, especially since I can't turn on the radio because Roommate/Landlord is still asleep. Grrr. Anyway, gonna go take trash out, even though I think I missed today's pickup. TTYL.

						   Once again, Bingo! night has come and gone. Now that they're more used to us, people are being chatty and really helpful. AD came with, and even won money! Go AD! We offered to bring them a watermelon from the Farm Stand for next Tuesday, and they accepted, so I guess there will be a part 3 to the continuing Bingo! saga. Gotta say, that even on Thursday nights, when it's all paper Bingo, it's still cheaper than a night out dancing or playing pool. And no hangovers.  Today was a karma cleansing kinda day. Tomorrow I picture more of the same. Listened to some music, took down the old bookshelves and turned the bottom 2 shelves into a nightstand table, which meant I had to move my bed.   I then cleaned out a ton of stuff from under my bed, and re-discovered a paper lamp my Aunt LG got me for my birthday a few years back. Hung the lamp, which meant screws in the 8 foot ceiling. All by myself, too!   Threw out a lot of shit, including disks and CD's from the Boy I broke up with a good 4 years ago, and a stuffed animal from my Biological Mother. It felt good, sometimes it's just freeing to know that you can let go of material things, and that the sentiment attached to them will be lost as soon as they're out.  Put away pictures which I've had hanging around since the last time I attempted to clean, with a much lower degree of success. When I was just about running out of things to do, my new bookshelves were delivered! Very cool, as I was not expecting them to arrive until tomorrow. Go Target! Also moved some posters and stuff. I feel much better about the new arrangement. My bed is now way too close to the door, but I'll deal.  Well, I expect exhaustion to set in any time, so I'll just go away now. Night.

						   Well, tonight I saw the Boy. We did not speak, but I saw him. Other than being wrinkled, he looked okay.  Alright, he looked lickable. I wanted to kick his skinny ass so hard he hit the wall. It kinda scares me when I get that angry. I chain smoked a whole lot, and tried desperately not to look at his beautiful face across the room. He's SO gosh darn pretty. Of course, I'm vomit-inducingly in love with him, even as pissed at him as I am right now, so there it is.  I got drapes! They're tab-top sage green cotton drapes, although I was extremely tempted to get the fake suede ones in the same color. I think they'll coordinate well with the terra cotta color of the walls, and blend nicely with the dark wood of the trim and my furniture.  I also bought shoes. Two pair, even. And yes, I remember that at about 2 this morning I was convincing myself that I didn't need more shoes. Buck that. I got GODDESS shoes. Really sexy, bright red (they match a little red dress K convinced me to buy, which I will probably never wear) with ankle straps and 3 inch heels. I also got the shoes I went there to get.   To backtrack, I've been looking for a pair of comfortable, low to mid height heeled summer shoes, which can be either casual or a little dressy. Open toed, also, and cheap. Found 'em! Only took me trips to 4 shoes stores since March. Now I can toss a couple of pairs of shoes I think I bought back in college. Or not. Well, maybe in the Fall. I threw out a pair of summer shoes last Fall. The problem with shoes, especially in Summer, is that I have very wide feet with high arches, and I don't wear leather, so finding shoes is a nightmare. Once I find a pair I like, I hoard them until they literally fall off my feet. For example, I bought espadrilles for my college graduation, pretty much soley because I was wearing a gold linen dress, and they had gold flowers on the soles. They cut into my feet, and they were heavy as all hell. I wore them for almost 2 years before they literally fell apart as I was walking across Capitol Hill. Good thing there are shoe stores in Union Station. Incidentally, I still have the dress, although I never wear it because I can't seem to find a pair of shoes to match it.  Okay, so I may have a little problem with shoes. Fetish? Perhaps. All I have to say to any snide remarks is, try having sex in high heels some time.  Anyway.  I'm exhausted, and if anyone is reading this, I'm sure some part of this rant has offended them. I personally blame it on 2 cups of coffee with sugar, followed by Beer. Not usually a beer drinker, but I figured that if I started drinking my Vodka I might not stop. And I don't want to spend tomorrow puking so much. Nighty Night.

						    A Strange Thing just happened to me.   I attempted to sign into my account to post here, only to discover that I had been signed out. Even stranger is that I did not sign myself out, and I did not write down my password, etc in my password reference place when I started this account, so I had to do a re-registration thingy and change my password. Very odd.  It's  good thing I'd previously planned on going out today, as the weather is grey and miserable all over the area. As an added bonus, Roommate/Landlord has finished teaching for the summer, so he's in the basement sleeping and I cannot insulate anything today. In all likelihood this means that at just about the time my Fiberglas burns from yesterday have healed, I will have to start again. I'm angry about this lack of household improvement only because I was in a groove yesterday before I had to stop and clean up, and I'll probably forget what the heck I'm doing before I start again.  Been searching through my CD collection the last few days, looking for gaps I need to correct. I'm a music and movie junkie, can't get enough, good or bad. I'm partial to romantic/comedies and Sci/Fi as far as movies go, but my musical tastes are much more varied. Thus, the gaps. Things I enjoy, which I just don't have the time or money to find and procure. With all the free time I have, and the help of my Amazon.com Wish List, I have begun to at least decide on a few things I will need to get when I have the money.  The first things I will focus on are Country and Reggae. I went through a big Reggae phase in middle school, but I never bought the artists I liked when I switched over to CD's. Had a lot of them on downloads, but downloading has become so chancy, and I cannot afford to be sued in my near-destitute state. Country music is one of those things where I have a certain small group of artists in the form that I enjoy, and most of the rest of it drives me nuts. I am, however, being dragged to see Gretchen Wilson later this summer, so I figure I should at least get that. All I have right now is Mary Chapin-Carpenter and Nanci Griffith, who is really more rockabilly, which is of course my favorite portion of Country music. I'm going to have to buy a Brad Paisley CD for a friend (ick) but if I ever try to buy Brooks and Dunn, just take me out and shoot me.  Alright, I'd better get going or I'm going to miss the infamous erratic mid-afternoon bus to the Metro. Gotta love public transportation. Squirrel out.

						   Had a very productive day. Began with a trip to the store to get cigs and dryer sheets. Went on to working on the insulation project in the basement, and washing a ton of dishes.   Roommate K came home and decided we should go out. I agreed, but neither of us could think of anything to do, other than playing tennis, which was out because of the rain. It POURED this afternoon. After we'd pondered for a while, I remembered that today is Tuesday. Tuesday and Thursday our local volunteer fire department has BINGO! My roommates and I have all been meaning to go, but we always forget. Well tonight, we remembered.  BINGO was great fun. It was real old school bingo, with the kitchen open, and the old people, and the whole nine. We didn't win, but it was just SO great. We people watched, and played all but a few of the games. They even let us smoke inside! We're so going back, and bringing more people.  Roommate/Landlord leaves for Eastern Europe on Saturday, so my usual weekend trip to work the Farm Stand with Roommate K will be all shot to hell this week. I may go out Saturday night if his flight is early enough, so that I can get a cut of Sunday's profit.   If I stay in town, not much to do. AW is out in the boonies with the 'rents, AD has her Boy and shows to work all weekend, My Boy is still not speaking to me, Roomate K will be at the Shore without me, Roommate M has apparently decided to get a life (which is actually good, as I was beginning to worry after him) and CC and (Male) JJ are also no longer speaking to me. (Shock! Shock I say! Assholes.) Female JJ is frantically planning her wedding for this fall, and JF is in NY, which is almost as far as my folks. In short, too few people who I care to see live here, and fewer still care to see me. My social circle blows sometimes.  Anyway, it's only Tuesday, so I may just think of something yet. Stay tuned, all you people out there, of which there are none. In the meantime, the grand plan for tomorrow is to buy new drapes for my room. I got a bookshelf today, to finally replace the crappy grey plastic one I bought in college, and I've been wanting to replace the curtains in my room since I re-painted, coming up on two years ago. The cat ripping the shade on one window was what finally decided me. It's just not as much fun to buy household goods while out of work, but I'll deal.  The latest deal on the job front is that I got a call last Thursday from someone I used to work with asking for my resume, but have not heard back. I worry that they can tell I fudged it a bit, or ran a credit check and saw the unemployment, but nothing to be done about that. I still think I deserve some time off to get my shit back in order. However, if anymore shit pops up (say for example, my Aunt G's brain tumor needs to be removed, or my Mom's cancer comes back, or my Birth Mother writes to me again) I'm just going to throw in the towel on getting together. Perhaps whatever force runs the universe and all its wondrous elements just does not want me to be happy.   Oh sure, I get fleeting moments of happiness. I danced with my cousin's baby at my brother's wedding. The Boy and I had great sex, and he was considerate of me most of the time. I have great friends to go on road trips with. Those things aside, perhaps I am not meant to have a successful relationship, a great job, a clean well managed home, or an empty reading list. Let's not even get into the fact that I'm supposed to have kids by now.  Best line in  The Princess Bride : Learn to live with disappointment.

						   Yet another weekend out at the Farm, working the Farm Stand, has come to an end. We thought we were busy last weekend, but we had no idea. We sold about 140 DOZEN ears of corn Saturday and Sunday. My cut of this weekend's profits was roughly half of our total for last weekend, and it was split 4 ways unequally. I'm sore and tired and sick of the air mattress in the unfinished guest room, but it was such a good time.  Miss P who works at the Liquor store to one side of the stand brought her granddaughter G to visit with us today. Visit evidently means leaving 2 girls with a mobbed Farm Stand and a four-year-old for 8 hours. She's a cute little kid, but she's got a boatload of issues for 4. She's sweet, and a bundle of energy, so she about wore us out and managed not to annoy too much as she begged for attention and got underfoot. I have no idea how Miss P manages it when we're not around and she has to bring G to work.  The  Friday Recap  is that nothing happened Friday. There was potato and pasta salad made, I packed, I caught the bus to the Eastern Shore. Luckily, there's still salads left tonight, so I can get some for myself.  The Nails of Death are about gone. No idea whether that's good or bad. Painful, though. Still missing the Boy, painfully. He's still not speaking to me, which really irks me. My Mom told me tonight it's his loss, and I know that's true, but I lost too; no one seems to understand that.  Well, smoke, then bed. Night.

						   So, interview went well, need to settle a few things on Tuesday, but for now I am off to the Shore! Will be leaving in a bit to pick up K and AD from their respective offices in an attempt to beat the traffic. Also, need to clean out the car and throw the last few things in.  This morning worked out perfectly. Got there a bit early, filled out paperwork, typing test, did the interview, and away I went by noon. Got home, cleaned up a bit, took the garbage out, cleaned the cat box (fun) and got to eat lunch. Printed directions for the drive (2 weeks I've been asking K's Mom for directions, got them around 1 today) and got out the cooler for the drive.  That's about it. See you Tuesday.

						    Name the Disney Cartoon   (Hint, it's a short, not a feature.)  So today, when I was all excited about taking this job I mentioned, starting on Tuesday, I got a call from a headhunter. This is a woman who sought me out in April, when I was still working, and did a telephone interview with me. Haven't heard from her since.  Well, today she called me back, to tell me about a job. She sent me the job description, which is just fascinating. It is, in short, the job I've been looking for all these many months, since before I lost my last one. I have an interview tomorrow, which I'm dreadfully excited about!  K and I went out tonight searching for a dog door. After hitting Home Depot and PetSmart (where I came very close to getting another cat) we decided to just buy one on the Internet. When we got home, 1776 awaited me! Joy!   Went to see JWS tonight to use his CD burner. In the year and a month or so than I've known him, he has never so successfully ignored me. We spoke a bit about trivial things, but nothing big, and not for very long. Got the heck outta there ASAP, and headed home, to get ready for tomorrow.  Decided I'll make my life easier by just wearing the same outfit as to my interview of earlier in the week, and my bag is mostly still packed from the non-trip last weekend, so all I really have to do is throw stuff in the car in the AM, do the interview, run home, throw more stuff in the car, then sand until it's time to pick everyone up. Perhaps I'll even get some of that out of the way tonight, and stuff a few things in the trunk. At least, I should return Roommate/Landlord's jacket to his vehicle, before I adopt it and hate to give it back at the end of the summer. It grew chill Wednesday night, and additional clothing was required.  Wish we'd taken a picture when we went to see Life of Brian. We decided to dress up for the heck of it, and we looked darn good, all 3 of us. AD calls us "The Posse", which is apt as we do travel in the same small circle, pretty much always together. It's much fun when we all drag other friends or guys along, then just ignore everyone else. Great friends. Tomorrow, the ROAD TRIP! Only 2 hours, but should be a blast.  Talk to you Tuesday, unless I squeeze an update in post-interview. In the meantime, happy 4th to all who might visit, live long and prosper, and watch 1776 if you get a chance. You'll thank me.

						   And boy, is my time being stolen. Been wandering around all day, nothing much accomplished, listening to Cab Calloway and surfing the net. Of all the things I set out to accomplish today, all I have managed to do is send JWS an e-mail which was slightly less than polite.  At least I'm showered and dressed. Looking good, too if I might say so. Haven't called back about the job (can you say self-sabotage, boys and girls?) and obviously haven't left the house.   I'm currently debating the wisdom of driving to Georgetown in the middle of the day (stupid, I know) or at least taking the car to the metro so I am not at the mercy of the bus. Of course, I could just not go. I'm seriously considering this as an option right now. After all, if I go and the dress fits and all, I still might have to wait until Tuesday to purchase it after paying for the plane ticket to Chicago, and I'll need gas money for tomorrow. Plus, there are so many stores in Georgetown, that seems like a bad idea right now. Better to just call about the job, change into fatigues (my Mom's word for grungy housework clothes) and get cracking on the sanding, as I may have less time next week.  Okay, now that I've talked myself out of going, I'm going to go ahead with the new plan. Oh, and more links.   urlLink Bare-bones PC humor

						   So, the in-office interview went very well. Will have to communicate with them tomorrow to see if it pans out, but it looks like all is a go! I should have a new job, at least for the rest of the summer, beginning after the holiday! Not terribly challenging, this position, but it's money, and it should keep me from going too crazy.  We (K and AD and I) tried to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight, but could not get tickets for our preferred venue, so it was beaten out by a showing of Monty Python's "Life of Brian". Which was great fun, truly enjoyable film; not as great a film as Holy Grail, but funny.  I have made 3 new DVD acquisitions about which I am terribly excited.  Peggy Sue Got Married, Annie Hall, and 1776.  1776 is one of my favorite musicals, and is really a better movie than a stage production (I saw the revival on Broadway with Brett Spiner). Also have the original Broadway soundtrack from 1974. Annie Hall is just one of my top 5 favorite films of all time. Definitely on the Desert Island List. Peggy Sue, not Desert Island List material, but it fits into my whole movement to buy all of my favorite 80's movies on DVD. Got most of the Brat Pack stuff. Still need The Big Chill, and a couple of others.  The Desert Island List: Annie Hall, as I mentioned Casablanca Ghostbusters Citizen Cane Empire Records Breakfast At Tiffany's The Sound of Music Pretty In Pink Arsenic and Old Lace The American President Bringing Up Baby My Fair Lady Monty Python and The Holy Grail Schindler's List X-Files: Fight the Future  Of course, that's if I can only bring 15. Somehow, that's always the number I get when people ask. So there they are. No Cole Porter, I know. But choices must be made.  I also got some new CD's today. These I had ordered when my Mom gave me birthday money, and they just arrived! Bette Midler and Cab Calloway. I know, I have strange taste in music. I heart Bette! The Cab Calloway I mainly got to have, if that makes any sense. I enjoy the music, but it's not my favorite. It is, however, an influence on many other artists I also enjoy.  Is it wrong of me that I like Bette Midler's version of "Miss Otis Regrets" better than the original? I feel guilty somehow.  Anyway, tomorrow I have a jaunt planned to Georgetown. I asked to try on a dress at a little boutique in Dupont Circle, and they didn't have it in my size, but they have it at their sister store in Georgetown, so I'm going to try it on. They said the color is a bit different, so even if it does fit I may still not get it, but we'll see. Even if I don't, this may be my last day of leisure for a while, so I'm going to enjoy it. Friday will likely be spent in packing, laundry, and home repairs. Monday we are going to the beach rather than heading back to the city Sunday night, which should be a great trip. Three girls in the car, radio (or CD) blasting. Fun times.  Going to call JWS tomorrow also, to see if I can pop by to use his CD burner. As I speak to him so little, no point in trying to sneak in on the DL. I'd inevitably pick a time when he was home. Off to bed now, tomorrow I might have a job! Stagnation is ending! Now if only I could figure out how to get home repairs done while working all week and all weekend, I'd be set. Latah.

						    Sorry, I seem to be out of interesting titles at the moment.   Tonight K and AD and I went with AD's Boy to see a friend of his sing Jazz standards, his first semi-professional paid singing gig! Was expecting...well, I don't know what. I knew from the party Saturday that the singer was nice and cute and laid back, but wasn't sure about the singing thing. First, we got lost on the drive up, and took a lovely tour of scenic Rockville and Gaithersburg (for those not in the know, far from home, farther from Downtown DC). Once we found the place, it was packed, and there we were, 4 of us crowded around a little table, AD's Boy's friends across the room. Food sucked. But the singing. WOW. This guy has an amazing voice. He doesn't have much presence, though, so I don't know how the career of singing will work out, but what an instrument. I was impressed.  Fun evening, one of the guys who hit on me Saturday was there and was attentive again. It's sweet, but so far too soon to even contemplate dating or responding. Also, I'm far too wrapped up in JWS, even now. It's really better to wait until you can hold an entire conversation without mentioning the Ex before you start dating a new one.  AD's Boy is wonderful, I am reminded of this every time I see him. One of those guys you think doesn't exist until you meet one. He's madly in love with AD, is totally honest and genuine, calls her beautiful and wonderful in such an offhand way that it's an even bigger compliment, and is polite to and interested in K and I because we're AD's friends, and he plans to stick around for a while. Also, he collects really interesting, intelligent, and handsome friends. I'm proud to be accepted, in a way. We'll see how it all goes, but I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him and his Boyz in the future.  Anyway, there was Jazz, there were friends, there was fun, there will be sleep soon. Better stop blathering and be off. Ciao!

						   And no, I'm not referring to JWS.  Last night, K and I decided to have a girly evening, to celebrate the lack of guys in the house right now. We (I) cooked dinner (Fettucini Alfredo), then we watched a bad horror movie and painted our toenails. While I cleaned up from dinner, she reserved our flight to Chicago. Very excited about the trip. We're going to visit SS, and possibly meet up with some of my old co-workers from when I was working there a few years ago.  After I did the dishes, I went to take the trash out, and one of the dogs escaped. He does this every once in a while, and usually we just let him run around for a while and wait until he comes back, but there's been a lot of police activity and road construction around here lately, so we tried to catch him before something BAD could happen. Took almost 2 hours. Stupid f-ing dog.  After the dog was safely home, we read tarot cards. Haven't broken mine out in over a year, way pleasantly surprised at the outcome. And now K has her own deck, so she can practice and such if she so desires. Lucky I had a spare unopened deck around, as she did not have one, and she gave me a very interesting reading.  I'm fascinated by the art of divination. The imbuing of your spirit and energy onto a concrete object for the purpose of seeing a situation or aspect of yourself, and extrapolating what might happen in the future based on current conditions, is really one of the best ideas man has come up with. I understand why Catholics and others do not fully approve, but it seems silly. After all, you can't base your life on a tarot reading. All you can do is see where you are now, and where you're headed if you stay on the path you are on right now. Your tarot reading can be different every day, or every hour. Doesn't mean it's wrong. Just means something about your attitude or situation has changed since the last time.  Of course, there are other parts of divination I believe are bunk, and some I believe are regularly misunderstood in popular culture. Horoscopes, for example. A Horoscope is pure BS unless you know the exact place and time you were born, and take that information to someone who can create a star chart based on what the planets were doing at that time. I don't get behind tea leaves much, but I can see how it is possible to get an accurate reading with them the same way you can with tarot cards. The crystal ball, I think if it were done correctly by some of those rare individuals who see auras, could work. I at least understand the idea enough to see the plausibility. I don't think it's particularly reliable, though. After all, all your aura reveals is your personality, not your future. Egg yolks and sand, I have no patience to even study, I think they are so far out there. Egg yolks also remind me too heavily of dealing with dark forces, and I shy away from that. runes; eh. About as reliable as dice, or viewing victory at Monopoly as a sign that you should go into business. Too much self-interpretation involved, too much room for human error, not enough concentration can possibly be placed upon the toss for it to be reliable for more than a few seconds as an indicator of your life path.  So anyway, that was last night.  This morning, I got a call regarding a job. Very excited that I've at least got another prospect, none of my recent resumes have worked out, not even so much as a "Thanks, but no thanks" card in over a week. And the person who called last week about another job has still not gotten back to me. Will have to see. I'll update later. For now, I am going to go sand, with the phone close by. Cheers!

						    Name the Cole Porter Musical.   Been a mostly-productive day thus far. I've decided that as Roommate M is moving out (most of his stuff has already departed, now it's all about money issues between him and Roommate/Landlord, to be conducted via e-mail) this is the perfect time to redo the empty room.  I'm kinda a dork about the house (see references to insulation project). It's not mine, I've been wanting to redo the bathrooms and replace the electrical system since we moved in, I love the place. Home improvements such as painting and gardening often fall to me, as I am most interested in them. I repainted my own bedroom, and we all took up the carpet in the main area earlier this summer. Roommate K and I decided that we'd get rid of the rest of the carpeting while Roommate/Landlord is away, so why not do the walls?  Why not do the walls? How about because they need to be sanded, then washed, then sanded again, then spackled, then sanded, then primed, and THEN painted. Got about 5 square feet done before I said the heck with it for a while. Somehow, I expect that we'll be showing the room with a ladder in it.  I know a couple of people looking for places, and I know K would prefer that no one move in, so we may just have to go the stranger route. I fully expect her to have the same reaction to my cousin her brother had, which was "that B* is related to you?". Hate that, as my cousin might as well be my sister, and while we are very different, we like one another very much. Well, we shall see.  Got a letter from my insurance company (regarding my health insurance, which I lost as part of my employment ending) and it seems that I am eligible for individual insurance. I plan to call and see what's what, hopefully they will let me get anti-depressants. I don't care what the Boy says, I think the last week or so indicates that I NEED to be medicated.  Hereafter, the Boy will be refered to as JWS, as he does not want to be the Boy any longer. Says he hasn't been reading this, but as no one seems to be having a problem finding it (so much for free form) it's better to lay off him a bit. I just don't trust him not to lie to me, as he's been making a habit of it lately.  The Dog Pack has beeen ill-behaved all day, and my patience wears thin. So does my appetite. Binge eating, definitly over. Go me! All this, and kitchen cleaning! the stove was so gross, I had to let cleaner sit for 30 mins, then go at it with a scowering pad. It's better now. Another home improvement I want to get done is to replace the burners on the stove, and the burner pans. And the insulation still needs to be finished. And I'll be gone most weekends. Wow, lots to do. Don't feel like it right now, though. Maybe later.

						   So, I stopped by the Boy's place today. OK, so after I drove Roommate-Landlord to the airport, the car just kinda steered itself that way.  Right.  We had a good talk, right up until the point when he told me that he's bad with relationships, bad with emotions, and there is no point in my waiting on him getting his shit together, as he has no plans to change.  My reponse:  When you grow up, give me a call.   Somehow, I don't expect that call anytime soon.  We made out a little. He mentioned that I looked good, and because I'm such a sap, I was excited to get even a backhanded compliment from the boy who offered to put his size 6 girlfriend (me) on a diet. Then, after instigating the whole thing, he reminded me that making out with someone you're trying to get over is BAD. Not sure, but I think he was more talking to himself.  If nothing else, I'm glad I went over, because now I don't feel so much like this whole episode was my problem. I get paranoid about that, as my last major breakup, the guy cited my depression as a major reason. Now, I feel pretty secure in knowing that my problems and his are two separate things. Still hurts like a bitch, though.  Also glad, that even though this will make things worse, I got to kiss him again. This has reassured me that I was not just idealizing a bad relationship, that there was potential there. Not to say that it's anything to place hopes of a marriage on, but there is more than lust and sexual compatibility.  In other news, my poor Mom, who has been having an employment crises of greater proportions than mine, has suffered another setback. Wish there was more I could do, but I offered to go into business (catering) with her, move back home and all, and she refused. Feeling worried about her, especially since in the midst of all this, she's had a irregular Pap. If you don't know what that might mean for a cancer survivor, you don't want to.  In the  Saturday Update , I did get in touch with AD, who brought Roommate/Landlord and I to the party with her. It was a total blast, I did things I haven't done in years. Best of all, I broke out the Good Camera. The camera my parents bought me when I turned 19 and decided I wanted to take up photography. The camera I love so much I never use it. Well, I used it, and I think I got some good shots. The All-Female orgy, alas, got no pics. Neither did the Hippy Smoking Loungue. But I was happy with the shots I got. I also got hit on a few times! Yay!  Roommate/Landlord was repentant regarding the flight schedule misunderstanding, and was a good buddy all weekend. Gotta give him props. Will probably post excerpts from his travel journal as he sends them. He is potentially a better writer than I am, except that he'd rather teach elementary school. Well, we need good teachers as much, if not more than, we need good writers today, so I guess he just gets more props.  Been talking to AW again lately, who has surprised me by being more understanding than I ever could have hoped. She gets mad props for not saying anything evil about the Boy, who looked and tasted utterly yummy today, btw. She's a good egg, and hopefully this spell of friendship and understanding signals the end of our yearly tiff. I suppose that was what was going on. We fight about once a year, don't speak, then something will happen to one of us, and the other forgives, and it gets better. Thank God she's been feeling forgiving, as I've been in a bad way, and up until now I haven't been able to get through to her. We'll see, but I hope for the best.  Next weekend, AD and AW may come out to the Farm with K and I. Woooo! Should be interesting. AW and Roommate K don't always get along, but they're both cool, and AD evens things out. And more veggies! Stay tuned for the cooking update.  Gotta go sleep (or drink more) now, so I'm gonna head out. Night.

						   OK, not so much of a caper really, but it's been interesting. We had someone come to look at the room today, who is about to make his decision ASAP. By tomorrow we may have a new Roommate, J. Sweet guy, has a girlfriend, laid back and friendly sort of person. We shall see. We also did a couple of phone interviews, but if he's willing to put the money down, we're willing to take him.  If this works out, the trip to Roanoke will be a go, which means 4 weeks in a row with dog sitters. My cousin, MS who I have mentioned, will be coming by this weekend as JWS will be out of town. Actually, he will be out of town for the next few weekends, so things may get a bit tricky with sitters. We have MS, and S who works with K, but those are the only other two who have been here before, and this will be MS's first time here so she may not be ready to help out again so soon. It kinda cramps your style to have to drive from VA to the other side of DC twice a day. I plan on doing something nice for her trouble.  As part of my new posting links fetish, I Googled "Secret Squirrel" today, and I was WAY more excited than I should have been to find  urlLink this . Imagine, I took my nickname, turned it into what I thought was a creative blog name, and lo! I have discovered a cartoon show I previously knew nothing about. In honor of my new discovery, I will forever adore the person who buys me one of  urlLink these .  I'm posting another letter now, and that will bring us up to date with the Roommate/Landlord correspondence. He hasn't written recently, so hopefully he will soon. I worry. Night all.  July 6, 2004  I have unlocked the mystery. I now know the reason why my beverage of choice when out on social engagements is a cup of tea. It's not that I really even like tea that much...It's that when you get  a cup of tea, regardless of the establishment's policy on free refills, you always get a free refill. No food service worker, regardless of the establishment's class, will say no when you request another cup of hot water. Then the tea-bag remains for a second cup. Sometimes even a third. I've found that as folks here are bussing the tables/bars while I'm drinking my tea they will  take away the little dish and throw away the tea-bag if I'm not being vigilant. I am now sure to strategically place the used tea-bag in a location between my arms that would require reaching into my personal space to retrieve. God, I'm a Jew.  There are plenty of public urinals around Amsterdam. There are signs strategically placed around Amsterdam pointing to them which are  remarkably inclusive. Besides just having the word "urinoir", a visual aid is also provided, showing a picture of a man urinating.  Street music is everywhere. There are dozens of folks all over  Amsterdam on corners playing music, usually with creatively created instruments. Two of my favorites are the guitar and violin duo who play American rock songs of the 70's and the young girl who flutes on her dollar store recorder. There are tons of bums everywhere. I haven't taken any in with any personal interest, even though they are constantly coming up to me. Sometimes I tell them I might have something for them if I see them again, but I've never run into any twice. I haven't even again seen the English lad with blistered and tattooed hands who asked if he could borrow some money so he could afford to spend the night in the Christian youth hostel. He made sure I knew it was a Christian hostel.  I went to the Otherside cafe again. One of the Portuguese-Dutch I had met the other day was there. He nodded a hello my way, a kind gesture I was not expecting. That doesn't do anything to knock El Salvador off of the "greatest people in the world" pedestal. I'm not sure if lack of eye contact is a cultural thing. On my trips I typically make eye contact with people as I walk the streets and nod a simple hello. Here if someone catches me making eye contact they quickly look away. Either everyone feels a little guilty here or I'm just scary looking. The Black African immigrants here are about the only ones who can establish eye contact long enough for me to nod.  Of course right after that hello comes a pitch for cocaine or ecstasy.  Cal was in a mood last night. One of the boys had put a paper towel in the toilet and caused it to overflow. He went on whining to me for a long time about the mischievous things they do, and how he is sick of running a brothel and may have an opportunity to run a hotel in Spain. Yuan, the Asian fellow, got a lot of abuse from Cal. Whenever Cal wasn't looking he'd slip himself a little drink or try to offer his services outside of the bar so he could keep the entire cut of the money for himself. He kept jumping over to every man who walked in, often chasing them away before they could even order a drink from the bar.  Amsterdam will probably be easy to forget. Tomorrow I am off for  Latvia, and I can see Amsterdam becoming an insignificant little pleasure of this trip, even though I enjoyed it. I more enjoyed the time I spent in Szczecin with SZ's family. Perhaps that was because he was there.  I'm going to the Ann Frank house today. I promised myself I would. It's the next stop. urlLink

						   Sorry I've been neglectful the past few days, but my life has degenerated into a mass of home repairs, interviewing roommates, fretting over the job search, and cleaning and laundry. Sanding is almost half-done, which is exciting, for me at least.   Will be at the Eastern Shore again this coming weekend, then a weekend off. May go cause some mischief, I haven't decided yet. I've also received an invite to go visit the Roanoke Girls, we'll see if it pans out. Also, if the roommate interviews between now and then don't work out, I'll need to do some interviews that weekend.  Two letters today! Enjoy.  July 4, 2004  Hey to all those forwarded to. Happy 4th of July!!  The BBC World station in Amsterdam has no advertising for Coca-Cola or Duetche Bank. All the adds are for countries.  I decided to look for an even cheaper hotel then the one I stayed in last night for 65 euros. I managed to find one less then a  block down the street for 50 euros...The Stablemaster.  Leather pride flags hung from the building. Most of the businesses  hang flags representing various nationalities and sexual orientations. The Stablemaster reception is a small leather-bar complete with a dark-room. It took me a second to realize I was at a reception desk among the red lights and the leather-sex artifacts and artwork on display. For six euros they have jerk-off parties 5 nights a week in the bar, "a great way to start your vacation."  There was one single room for 50 euros that had been previously available. Too bad I didn't find the place when I first got there.   To get to my room I had to go up a long winding staircase to the very top, where the attic room at the tip of the "Tower Phallice" was mine...All mine. Has a decent view of Amsterdam, a TV, plumbing, and a cartoon poster of about a dozen or so men in various outfits of leather and helmets having sex with each other. I am so staying at the Stablemaster. I AM THE STABLEMASTER!  I did stop into a gay bar last night and sipped on some cranberry  juice, talking to a man from Pittsburgh who turned out to be the owner. He expressed concern over his business, which used to do so well. Despite the fact that every hotel room is loaded with backpackers from around Europe, tourism is a problem...It's all about the USA. Since 9-11 and the falling value of the US dollar tourism has dropped, which although there still are European students, this does not help gay Amsterdam which is apparently suffering.  Which is a shame since the scene here is  overwhelmingly integrated.  Most people have been incredibly nice, except for the occasional Dutch with no patience for the weary traveler. The tourists have all been great though, except an errant string of arrogant bastardism in the Japanese tourists. I guess one would expect a town where everyone is high to be pretty nice.  July 5, 2004  A number of establishments have become places to visit as I make my daily round of Amsterdam. Only one of the places I like has one of those damn people who want to collect 50 euro cents from you to  use the bathroom. With a bladder like mine, I'd just as soon find a  sewer.  I'm constantly drinking water, so of course with that comes the  constant need to pee. I keep one bottle of water and fill it up regularly, using it until I loose the bottle.  Then it's time to buy a new one. Yesterday I lost my bottle, so I thought I'd stop in the Stablemaster bar to get a bottle of water, and talk to the man who runs the place. I really wasn't planning on attending one of the Stablemaster's jerk off parties.  However when I walked in the door, (actually I had to be buzzed in) the receptionist, who has become quite familiar (I think he owns the place), answered the door in his under-ware and invited me in. Already in an awkward position I went with the flow, where I was required to remove all clothing before entering the bar. However I obtained permission to wear boxers. I'm such a prude.  I went in, there were a few men sitting naked at the bar and a few  others upstairs in the dark-room. Nobody was talking...Incredibly boring. And to add insult to injury when I ordered a bottle of water they only had glass bottles, hardly the kind of water carrying tool I want in my pocket. This was a tragedy, because despite soaking up the interesting atmosphere, my main objective of the visit was to get a plastic bottle of water. I left quickly. The receptionist asked if I didn't like it. "It's boring. Nobody is talking."  That bar is not one of the regular places I go on my rounds. Neither are the insides of the window boxes where the whores advertise  themselves in the red light district. Last night I was walking by and the whores did their typical beckoning, until I passed a set of three windows where three African women were on display. One of them took the aggressive approach and opened the door, calling me over.  Unable to resist I went and spoke to her.   She told me what she could do, and not wanting to make her feel unattractive (as well as with the confidence of being in Amsterdam) I said I was a gay. The prostitute told me I was an abomination, shoed me away and shut the door. However, the other two women (really just one...Kate was rather quiet) started yelling things at me, and I unsuccessfully  tried to defend myself by stating that whores are in no position to judge me.  I ended up inside the glass window, the red curtain open for all to  see, having a debate with the women on the politics of sexuality. Their main and repeated argument was that I can't have a baby by having anal sex...That was why I am an abomination. I tried to defend by saying that they used condoms with their clients...This also prevents conception...So how is it worse?   There was no winning either way. During our argument a client came in for Kate, so she closed her curtain and did her thing. Kate was quite beautiful.  She yelled "bye assfucker" when I left. It was great.    One of the places I'm probably going to go to after I finish writing  this letter is a coffee shop in the part of Amsterdam that looks like it has the potential to become the unintegrated gay center, as many of the businesses elsewhere in Amsterdam are not doing as well. A youthful (20's and 30's) gay and hipster crowd hangs out there, and you can hear the European techno sensation Miss Kitty blaring. I spoke to some Portuguese residents of Amsterdam, as well as the guy who was working there. They talked to me, but I felt like they saw me as a joke. That seems to fit in with my theory of the friendliness of tourists here and the shady rudeness of the locals.    Another place is the bar run by the man mentioned in my last letter  from Pittsburgh. I often go and talk to Cal in the evenings, as he is a fun conversation and has a lot of knowledge to share.  Cal was a chemical engineer for many years, working in areas all over the world before he left the field, moved to Amsterdam and took over the business of a gay brothel. There are a number of boys for hire. They don't strip like in Montreal, but just talk to people who walk in and try to seduce them. All the ones I have met so far have quickly realized I wasn't in the market and don't try with me. This is rather disapoiting because it's fun when they try.  Except for the Asian...he never quits. Cal always makes fun of him, but his relationship with the boys shows a lot of care. He claims he doesn't ever have sex with the boys, and if someone comes in off the street and tries to hustle he kicks them out.  The cost of an hour in one of the rooms with a boy is usually (I think) 120 euros (Though I once overheard the Asian offer free  services--brought to a quick halt by Cal).  45 of those euros go to the boy, 60 of them the government, and the rest goes to the bar. A  surprisingly bad deal for Cal.

						   Before I proceed to another letter from Roommate/Landlord, I'll note a few things from the day. Got a new backpack for $5, went out for cheap Mexican, which was quite tasty, and watched  Independence Day , which I haven't been able to bring myself to do since 9/11/01. Was pleased to find that it's still enjoyable.   Also, the Great Roommate Search has begun. We posted the ad on the usual site, with a few additions and Roommate K as the contact. Hopefully interviews should begin soon for the new occupant. More on that later. And now, on to the letter!  July 3, 2004  I like Amsterdam.  I think I'll stay awhile.  At first glance Amsterdam looks a bit like Europe meets Katmandu.  At any point you can hear the eerie ringing of bells that go off every 15 minutes from one of its magnificent structures that stand out like amazing Cathedrals, but tend to be shopping malls.  The trash covered roads are thin and take you on an endless walk through the narrow streets while cars slowly creep their way past the hoards of thousands that never stop walking the streets. These streets hold quite a few secrets.  Sprinkled all over Amsterdam like a bit too much Parmesan are little coffee shops, who do sell coffee. Their main ware is Marijuana, though. Every shop has a menu with a wide selection of marijuana types among the pictures of Bob Marley and aliens that dominate the wall decor. It's legal to smoke it in the shops, but word on the street is you can be fined if you take it outside.  There is something very Arab about Amsterdam. I feel like most of the people I have met who actually live in Amsterdam are Arab or Persian or whatnot. It's not just the food....Even the language sounds Arabic, perhaps it is. Arabian music fills the streets from all the various food establishments, competing with the rap that comes out of the pot "coffee shops". They are not all Turkish; I have met some from Morocco and Pakistan so far.  Occasionally in Europe I have come across an establishment that sells bagels. I've had a couple, always purchased from a friendly Asian. I think the Asians have cornered the European bagel market.  Yesterday, after eating an Arab meal I started to venture through the streets.  I first stopped at a coffee shop, where I bought a joint and sat in the company of other travelers who spoke of the world in smilies, and unlocked the secrets of the universe in a manner that is only college-kid-smoking-pot.  Then I walked. Shops all around displayed ads for magic mushrooms and all things sexually related. Then I saw her. She was a thin Asian woman, her feet encased in a pair of delicate white high-heel shoes at the base of her panty-hose. She wore a white bikini, her loins cleanly waxed and her breasts begging to pop out through her top. Her face was thickly covered in makeup, her lips puckering as she beckoned me over to her window with her finger. It was like looking at a mannequin in a fancy store, her standing  behind glass and framed by red neon lighting. To her left was an endless parade of glass windows; each with a different whore of all colors, shapes and sizes to choose from. It's hard not to laugh when they look at me and act sexy.  The entire red light district of Amsterdam is literally covered with  thousands of whores on display in windows, and the men walk by,  occasionally stopping and visiting the whore of their liking. Last night I was sitting in a coffee shop with some English students who were in Amsterdam for their friend's 18th birthday. I was asked if I had visited a whore yet. I said no. I was told that I hadn't explored enough and needed to go find the girl of my dreams. Who knew she was in a glass cage in Amsterdam?  Amsterdam is the only city I have been in where the gay sex scene seems more conservative then the straight sex scene. I haven't seen any apparent male whores, and all the gay bars seem rather classy, even though some of them have dark rooms in the back.  So I'm going to Riga on the seventh of July.  There are a number of  cheap airlines that can take you anywhere in Europe quite cheaply.  I was able to get a flight from Amsterdam to Riga for 49 euros; a price significantly cheaper then the train ride to Amsterdam from neighboring Germany. This means I won't be going with my original idea of training and boating through Scandinavia and across the Baltic sea. Who really cares about Sweden anyways?  So, I'm off to venture more...Perhaps I'll visit the Ann Frank house. Or perhaps I won't.

						   I'm sorry I haven't done this earlier, since I did mention that I might post Roommate/Landlord's travel journal. Got a huge volume of messages from him over the weekend. I thought I should start with this one. Names have been changed to protect the innocent.  July 2, 2004  It's been a rough time from SZ's parents. They have pretty much  figured out who I am at this point, but his mother didn't know that I would be staying with her sister in Poland. SZ didn't mention it when they talked on the phone, but when Aunt Y got on she went on about how great I am.  It was then that SZ's mom asked to speak to him again and said "You know and I know, and I don't like it."  Aunt Y gave me a nice knicknack from Poland, a painted easter egg made of wood.  She also wanted to give me some music, as the late grandmother's room is overflowing with untouched CD's.  At first she thought she should give me some Jewish music, but I accepted something Polish.  I ended up staying in Berlin last night again out of convenience, since there was no direct route to Amsterdam and I didn't feel like getting on another train for six hours.  So I gave Berlin another chance.  I found a great cheap hotel.  When I got to the door I had to buzz  myself in, where I was greeted by a wide wooden staircase leading me up to the reception desk.  Several old German women sat around smoking cigarettes and drinking from tall glasses.  The receptionist took me further up the steps, through a long elegant dining room, and down another hallway of rooms.  The whole place had an air of an old mansion that had been partitioned into little tiny rooms, the original doors, wood trim and windows remaining.  My room was tiny and the bed fell apart if you moved around too much. It had a certain odor like that of a carpet that has been peed on by animals, and although it has been cleaned a thousand times over you can never really eliminate the stench.  However, judging by the picture of the pantless man in leather as you walk in, and the flyers for various golden shower parties around Berlin, the piss smell may have been part of the decor. I spent the night walking around Berlin's gayest district, talking to an attractive young man at first who abruptly and violently walked away when I denied his sexual request.  A group of guys were talking on a nearby corner, and one of them said something to me in German. I stopped and chatted, as other guys joined the corner and all started to pretend that they didn't know each other and were travelers from other countries. Some of them were rather aggressive in their approaches, as they greeted my by  grabbing my balls or nipples, and listing all the things they would like to do to me.  I found myself constantly slapping hands away.  It was fun.  I don't think any of them were gay. Judging by the way some of them  had the same approach to other men who walked by, as well as the one who claimed to be from Spain, I think they were all prostitutes.  The next morning I got up in time to have 20 minutes to catch a train to Amsterdam. They always check for tickets on the trains. I arrived in Amsterdam almost two hours ago.  No country has ever  brought about such confusion in me.  I couldn't figure out how to use the pay-phones, there were no street signs to guide me, and I even needed help logging onto this computer.  Every hostel and cheap hotel was booked.  I went from hostel to hostel, only to be told that they were all booked until Monday.  This town is crammed with backpackers from all over the world.  Who knew so many people like Marijuana?  Fortunately, there comes a luxury with traveling with a hidden amount of money:  I can afford a luxury hotel once in a while.  So I paid 120 euros to spend the night in the Golden Tulip.  As soon as I got there I took advantage of the amenities a fancy hotel has to offer:  I took a shower with a bar of self proclaimed luxury soap.  Anyways, I had a little meal at a falafel stand and now am going to  journey through Amsterdam.  Everywhere I've been in Europe so far is full of falafel stands.  It seems that the Arabs (or Turks...I haven't figured it out yet) have completely cornered the food stand market.  Anywhere I go I can get a falafel.  It's not just for Israel anymore.

						   Another fabulous weekend in the country. The trip up was quick and painless, there was pool at Pepperjack's (which I highly recommend to anyone who ends up in Easton this summer), then the work began.  Poor AD has a bad reaction to the heat, and Saturday at the fruit stand was a scorcher. K and I got her a Personal Cooling Device for Sunday, and she was much happier about that.   We barely sat down either day, and skipped dinner both nights to sleep, as we were all exhausted. K's Mom even stayed to help both days (she usually leaves after setup, and comes back to help take down) and with 4 people working we were spent. Not much in the way of music and catch, either, as we were just too busy to bother with changing the CD's or taking long breaks. We even slept through the fireworks on Sunday, which was sad as a helpful customer gave us the skinny on a prime observation point, and promised to save us a few beers.  We had fun though, there was much silliness and mocking, as per usual with the posse. Today, Monday, was just perfect. We were all up at 7, after entirely too much sleep, packed up, said goodbye to Mom and her Significant Male, got greasy food, went to Wally World for cheap CD's and new swim suits for the others, and headed to Ocean City!   Had a total blast, we spent almost an hour just cruising once we got there, we were having such a blast in the car, observing the people. I love that place, it's SO campy! Great fun. After a while we found parking and hit the beach. It was perfect weather, not too hot, but not so cool that you couldn't go in the freezing Atlantic. Not a cloud in the sky, and most of the weekend tourists had checked out, so not terribly crowded. We body surfed, I sunbathed while K and AD slathered on the sunscreen, we boy-watched, we ate greasy pizza, and just generally goofed off. We only stayed for about 5 hours, but that was all we needed. K and AD are both bright pink now, after many applications of 30 sunscreen. The only thing I applied more than twice was my face, and I'm fine. Gotta love my Italian heritage sometimes. Who am I kidding, I love it all the time, but more in the summer.   On the way home we stopped at the outlets in Queenstown, where I got 3 pairs of pants for $5 each! K got a pink backpack, which she's very excited about, as well as $5 pants of her own; and AD got a new suitcase for an upcoming business trip. All in all, a very successful, fun, productive, exhausting, and refreshing weekend.  When K and I were unloading the car, Our neighbor D poked her head out the bedroom window and said she has some extra furniture, and we should come over Wednesday night to pick it up if we want it. I'm very excited. We certainly have enough furniture, but free stuff is always appreciated.  When we left the animals for the weekend, my cat was running low on food, so I left a can of tuna, with a note saying that she should eat that if she ran out of the regular stuff. When I arrived at home, there was a full bag of cat food, and the glass I use to fill her drinking bowl was full of water. Very sweet. Love me, love my cat I suppose.  Well, I'm exhausted again, and my skin is feeling a little tender, so I'm gonna try to get to sleep early. Hope everyone had a great holiday, and I'll write more in the morning. Nighty night.

						   Do as other Bloggers do. Nothing new to report today, except that the primer coat is finished in JH's room, and that the CMA music festival was great fun. Also, the Posse went for coffee tonight, and K has recovered her lost ID, making going out much simpler. Therefore, I will proceed directly to a link.  urlLink This one is for K, who has an Anya-like hatred of bunnies . Also, a letter.  July 9, 2004  I spent yesterday allowing Girts to show me around Riga. He was a good time, although I'm not sure if his purposeful crashing into women was normal behavior or if he is a nutcase. At one moment he broke out into a rendition of "Don't Cry for me Argentina."  I'm not sure if he was singing out of inspiration from the Broadway musical or Madonna. Madonna certainly has her little foot in a lot of places.  We stopped in numerous cafes where he knew people, usually because someone who worked there was of his hairdressing clientele. Cafes can be synonymous with bars, as anywhere you can get a cup of coffee you will likely be able to get a shot of vodka, and the vodka flows like water. Despite my lack of interest in alcohol I found myself accepting a couple drinks from a man with the word 'derby' embroidered on his shirt, just to be polite.  Included in this drinking was an introduction to Absinthe. It took two attempts because on my first attempt the glass exploded while I was stirring the flaming beverage. I let Girts take care of the flame in the second attempt.  There was great music in the background when this unfortunate incident happened. There is live music coming out of every orifice of Riga, and very little of it is done by beggars. At the outdoor restaurant where I drank my Absinthe there was a country band singing Latvian versions of American songs. At one point they broke into a Latvian version of Johnny B. Goode.  With the ingestion of beverages comes the need to urinate. I envy dogs...Whenever they have to go, they find a convenient tree and can relieve themselves with no social stigma attached.  Girts also took me to a perejok cafeteria for lunch (which is the Russian name...Latvians have a different name that I forget). Perejok are those filled breads that Pesya serves, usually with meat or potato. Here they had them filled with anything imaginable, and each one cost only pennies. I had a field day.    I made it to a dance club last night. The people there danced with much more expression then in American nightclubs, and one could even interact with anyone in a friendly and inexplicit manner as one danced. This is a phenomenon I have only known at weddings.

						   I'm speaking, of course, for those of you who have been on the edge of your seats, waiting for the next letter from Roommate/Landlord. Well, it's all you've been hoping for. Before I get to that, I would just like to announce that I have begun priming JH's room, a whole day ahead of schedule! Thus, you have had to wait until tonight for the 'morning' post. Suck it up. Deal. This is not about you.  Okay, I'm sure no one really cares, so I'll stop pretending that if I had waited until tomorrow to post this, an angry mob would have broken down my door, berating me for depriving them of the word from Latvia. It was fun while it lasted, though. Enjoy the letter, and wish me luck with the painting. I'll need it.  July 8, 2004  I just ate a big ball of bread filled with cabbage and I don't know  what else. It cost 20 cents. Everything in Latvia is either priced  equivalently to the USA or is significantly cheaper.  Riga was a cold and rainy mess when I arrived, leaving me with the desire to sleep the day away. I did. I spent the night lurking through the streets of Latvia.  Across from my hotel is Origo, the fabulous shopping mall. After my  long nap I made it there just before all the stores closed and purchased a few items from the grocery store and had a small meal.  I had the worst falafel I have ever had, not that it was bad...Just the worst. This may be due to the fact that the kebob places here  are not run by people of Mediterranean descent, but by Latvian students who were waiting for ten o'clock so they could go home.    Latvians are beautiful. I found a hip little spot close to my hotel. Riga is bustling with bars and clubs all over the downtown area that run late into the night. The market for them was surprisingly high for a Wednesday night. I went into the little bar/clubbish place (paying the 1 Lat entrance fee) and ordered myself a tea. When I returned to my table after talking a walking tour through the establishment, Girts had sat down at my table.  Girts is a 22 year old hairdresser who knows about a dozen or so English words. Those words were adequate for us to carry on a conversation for an excessive amount of time. His style was a bit different from most young Latvian men, possessing a strong likeness to David Bowie. He went to great lengths to compare the USA to Latvia, and to explain why the USA is not good right now despite his limited vocabulary.  I got a chance to see his home, which ended the rumors I had heard that Latvia was a wealthy country. Girts entered a code to open the font door, which led into an empty courtyard of high-rise apartment buildings. We crossed it into his section. As we ascended the stairs the hallways were not well maintained, like many buildings you find around New York City.  His apartment consisted of a front room, kitchen and a bedroom. The  kitchen had a small stove with two or three burners, and the refrigerator was about half sized, containing only what I think was a bottle of ketchup. He had piles of things everywhere. There were pipes running across the ceiling of the kitchen and a tiny metal door was embroidered on the wall. Inside the door was a place to burn wood for heat. Perhaps you could burn coal there too, but he had wood.  There were two beds in his room and the walls were wall-papered with  newspaper. A row of books in Latvian, Russian, and a few in English laid in a pile on the windowsill. Among them was a Latvian-English  dictionary that became a communication  helper. Two other boys shared the room with him. A mat acts as the bed for the third boy.  Girts made me some Latvian tea consisting of green leaves, twigs and  crumbled orange rind. He handed me the cup, blowing on it to show me how to move the floating rind to the far side of the cup so a clean sip could be had.  I enquired about a bathroom, and he took a key and exited the apartment where a few bathrooms were available for the entire apartment house. Much like my hotel, there was no shower. I enquired where the shower was and was told there isn't one. Girts showers at work, where one is available.  When I left the apartment to hail a cab, a young man and woman who looked about 22 approached Girts and me. They asked for the time and I asked if they spoke English. The man spoke a little. Girts claimed he was an Englishman, leaving the lines of communication quite limited.  When I showed my watch to the man he decided it would look good on him, and started asking if I liked the girl (who happened to be gorgeous in her white pants with sequins on the buttocks which seem to be the current trend in Latvia). She put her hands on my hips, making my wallet itch. I stepped back and the man asked us if we wanted to go with them to a disco. Girts made me go back into the apartment with him and suggested I stay until morning because it was dangerous outside. I made it back to the hotel OK despite.

						   Why haven't I been writing? This is an excellent question. Usually, after a semi-non-eventful weekend on the Eastern Shore of MD, I LEAP! back to my computer to jot down my thoughts and attitudes (and of course, our vegetable haul and my plans for it) posthaste. Why did I not do this yesterday?  The 4400. 'Nuff said. Had great fun watching the premier, especially after a weekend filled with family quarrels not of my family. Will not spill the dirt here, let's just say I was treated to fighting the likes of which I have not heard since I was a small child, while Roommate K slept soundly. The show, if it lasts, promises to be a cultural phenom the likes of my beloved X-Files. Have I ever mentioned here that I'm a diehard Phile? Probably not. Life has a way of getting in the way of my rants, at least when I'm trying to cull down a day into easily managed chunks.  I should be ready to paint the empty room by Wednesday, which is most exciting, as we have a new Roommate, JH. The search is over! He won't be moving in until later in the month, and then only a few things at first, but we like him well enough, and he had the cash, so we took a gamble.  Spent a great portion of today chain smoking and working on the room. Also, as it's Monday, the dog pack were EVIL! Some days it seems easier to just open the front door and return them to the wild. Wouldn't be much of a point, though, as they always come back.  I have a few solid pages of fiction under the belt from last week, not sure what to do with them, though. A few people know bits and parts of things I wrote about, so I feel awkward about handing the file over to anyone just yet. Still, I feel the need for feedback. If JWS were more communicative (and not away on business at the moment) I'd give them to him, as he's a big supporter of me chucking the office career and devoting myself to writing fully. He gave me a copy of the Writer's Market for Valentine's Day earlier this year. I, of course, am just the type of sap to find this romantic.  Next weekend - Roanoke. Road trip down should be interesting, have no clue what the music of the moment is with the Roanoke Girls, but I'm guessing it has very little relation to my current vibe. However, Files will be watched, Mexican will be eaten, and laughs will be shared, which can only be good. As much as I hate to say it, or to miss out on cash, a week without veggies will be good for me. I'm just worried about how hard I'll crash the following weekend when I need to be up at 5 again.  Got a bunch of letters from Roommate/Landlord tonight, I'll take a break from sanding and post them in the morning, as opening a new window to open my e-mail and copy and edit the letters seems like a whole lotta work at the moment. Right now, I'm gonna smoke, change, and sleep. Squirrel out.

						   Another Letter. Also, a new home repair project.   With the carpet off of the floor and patiently awaiting pick-up on the curb, I have turned my attention to the hardwood floor beneath. K stayed home today to catch up on the sleep she has been sorely missing whilst working 7 days a week, and in the PM she jumped in to help with the floor. We got all of the trim up, removed the staples, rented a sander from the Home Depot (TOOLS!!!) and returned it, all in a matter of hours. I love having help with the house; it's so much more efficient!   Tomorrow, I go over the edges with the hand sander (I started tonight, but my arms were sore from earlier and I didn't get very far) and put the finish on. I'm excited that the room renovation is coming to an end at last. By Wednesday at the latest I should be back on insulation detail. Which means I should have the basement back in order just in time for K's cousins to be in town!   Roommate/Landlord will be so surprised to see what we've accomplished while he was away. Plus, we get to deduct repair costs from rent; you gotta love that. No progress has been made on the dog door project, or the kitchen, but there's still time. At least I'm down to 2 color schemes for the kitchen. We'll need to get the flooring relaced first, though, so I'm thinking it will have to wait until next summer at the latest.   Well, other than home repairs, and gearing up mentally for the convention next week, nothing much has been going on here. We're toying with the idea of a large group for BINGO! in August; stay tuned for updates. Last, but certainly not least, these TWO letters from Roommate/Landlord will bring us up to date. Post post, I plan to finish my lone beer, and retire for the night. Sleep tight, kids. Squirrel out.   July 20, 2004   Oh, Russia. Yesterday was a series of trials, beginning with my plane ticket to Krakow this Saturday,&nbsp;which I bought over the internet.&nbsp; After 5 days of waiting in Riga for my 'overnight' FedEx tickets, they still hadn't arrived. I figured I'd go to the airline office and have a new ticket issued.&nbsp;I called their St. Petersburg office.&nbsp; They said there was nothing I could do, and I would not be permitted on the plane without a ticket.&nbsp; They suggested I buy a new one.&nbsp; Sure, here's another $400 for a new ticket...in fact take $800 just in case there's a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;After arguing with the woman on the phone she suggested I call their main office in Warsaw.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; They suggested I buy a new ticket.   Next stop, Fed Ex (at a U.S. phone number). I checked my tracking number on the internet, which claimed tracking had stopped somewhere in Memphis.&nbsp; I called to see if I could change the delivery address.&nbsp; Apparently my tickets were in Britain.&nbsp; Latvia was an option on the website, and they promised 24 hour delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said I had to call the issuer, travelocity to change the shipping address (assuming they can make it to St. Petersburg before Saturday).   I called travelocity, who were actually quite pleasant.&nbsp; The woman was going to arrange it so I could pick up my tickets at the airport on Saturday.&nbsp; However, the LOT office was closed.&nbsp;She needs to check, but she thinks it'll be OK.&nbsp; I'll call tomorrow and confirm.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess this is what I get for dealing with a Polish airline.&nbsp; Polish bureaucracy can be so backwards and inefficient.&nbsp; E-TICKETS POLAND! GET WITH THE PROGRAM!   My phone bill from the hotel was about $40 US; a&nbsp;third the price of my hotel.&nbsp; Fortunately, as I explored yesterday I found a nice bed & breakfast for $40 a night.&nbsp; It's closer to the section of town I would prefer to be near and has a rather homey feel. I prepaid for 4 nights. If I only reserved it for one day I would have to re-register my hotel location with the Russian Federation every day for 30 rubles.   I took a detailed walk through the streets of St. Petersburg, finding it easier to orient myself with the road signs in Russian script.&nbsp; This experience has allowed me to understand better what a child must be going through when they learn to read.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to slowly work out every sound, and process it to figure out what the word is.&nbsp; Sometimes comprehension of what I read comes with a delayed reaction.&nbsp; Though spoken Russian I don't think I will ever understand.&nbsp; It's fun when I come across a word that has become familiar, and my brain is able to read the word without putting any effort into processing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like looking at a picture instead of a word.   The streets have some similarities to Latvia, although on a much larger scale.&nbsp; Mostly, the flashing lights of casinos.&nbsp; However, the casinos are&nbsp;overshadowed by the candy cathedrals and magnificent architecture that put much of the world to shame.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can hardly walk two blocks without running into a building that makes you stop and stare, numb to the drool that's dripping down your chin. I'll have to take some pictures.   My night-walk was eventful, at one point a crusty white sedan with three occupants pulled up beside me and a man started talking to me in Russian.&nbsp; I said I only spoke English and the man got out of the car.&nbsp; "Where is new club?" he asked.&nbsp; I didn't know. He continued to shout "gay, gay, bodybuilder, new club," and grabbed at my chest or belt, or place my hand on his chest again.&nbsp;I think it was hard for him to understand that even if he had the body of fitness celebrity John Basedow, I wasn't interested.&nbsp; After several&nbsp;minutes of me&nbsp;slapping his hand and backing away, they drove off. I watched as they sped away and I turned around, where two men were walking in my direction.&nbsp; As they got close to me they both jumped away, and one of them raised up his arms as if I was pointing a gun at him. I have no idea what was&nbsp;going on.   Then I met Joseph.&nbsp; After I was unable to answer his Russian question he asked me in English what the time was.&nbsp; We continued a conversation with his limited English and my limited (I can say peredjok) Russian.&nbsp; He sipped his beer as we continued chatting by one of the canals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen groups of boys sitting around drinking beer all over St. Petersburg, so it was fun to get in on that.&nbsp; Then Mochby, a man of about thirty with origins in Uzbekistan came over and joined the conversation.&nbsp; His English was at least as limited as Joseph's.&nbsp; He did know how to say 'sportsman'.&nbsp; He asked if I was a sportsman and started making boxing gestures towards me.&nbsp;Then he grabbed me by my jacket, and I struggled to get away.&nbsp; He held on tighter and I squirmed backwards, eventually escaping his grasp to find Joseph with his hand in my pocket, reaching for my wallet.&nbsp; I tried to defend it and was punched several times.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could see Mochby standing with my wallet, taking out the cash.&nbsp; I tried to say he could take the cash but I needed the wallet back, as without my ATM card I'd have no option but to disrupt&nbsp;my parents'&nbsp;Italian vacation by asking them to&nbsp;send me some money.&nbsp; Not that my assailants understood my pleads.   I lunged towards Mochby and grabbed the wallet out of his hands, the cash already removed.&nbsp; This cost me another blow to the face from Joseph.&nbsp; Mochby grabbed me by the jacket as I fought to claim my wallet.&nbsp; I slipped out from my jacket and sprinted up to the busy main road.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still had my wallet, and they were not chasing me. So I began the journey up the road back towards my hotel.&nbsp;   Quite a blow to the ego.&nbsp; This kind of thing isn't supposed to happen to me.&nbsp; I'm the indestructible streetwise international traveler, whose power of faith will remedy the most horrific of experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it did.   As I was walking two police men were parked on the side of the road, pulling drivers over and checking for sobriety.&nbsp; I approached one of them, not expecting anything to happen but more curious as to what their response would be.&nbsp; As I expected, they were not willing to offer any immediate assistance and pointed up the road to the police station where I could file a report. I figured I'd accept my losses and let it go, and continued walking up the road.&nbsp; Then Joseph and Mochby appeared walking in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Joseph punched his fist into his hand, making a statement of his Russian dominance.&nbsp; I stopped and watched them as they walked past. I let them get several yards ahead of me and followed, aware that just ahead were the policemen.&nbsp; Mochby became nervous&nbsp;at my stares and hailed a taxi; they got in and drove towards the police car.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sprinted with a vengeance, gaining a moment when another man hailed the same taxi and it pulled over.   I reached the police car just as the taxi was passing it, and pointed at the car yelling that the men who robbed me were in it.&nbsp; To my delight, the police men wasted no time and motioned for me to get in the car and they followed the taxi, pulling it over and checking the taxi driver's identification. They motioned for me to come out of the car and I pointed at Joseph and Mochby.&nbsp; The police escorted them out of the car, however Joseph got lucky.&nbsp; He took off on a mad dash, the police man unable to catch up with him.&nbsp; I haven't seen him again since then, but I have a few days left.&nbsp;So the next several hours was spent at the police station, where an interpreter was getting my side of the story, and the police asking Mochby for his.&nbsp; The interpreter was quite a good guy and I enjoyed hanging out with him as the hours passed.&nbsp; In fact, I thought all the policemen were pretty good people.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had an approach that was affective but was missing the aura of lawmen who take their job too seriously.&nbsp; They even drove me to my hotel after the event!&nbsp; In Belize they just told me to get lost.   The police took me to the crime scene to look for my jacket as evidence.&nbsp; I found it in the street in perfect condition!&nbsp; I could have sworn I heard it tear when I freed myself from Mochby's grasp.&nbsp; My map of St. Petersburg was also waiting for me on the street, which had fallen out of my pocket during the event. I am truly handicapped without my map, and my lack of it was a big barrier to my explaining the location of the crime-scene, as well as the location of my hotel.   They asked&nbsp;if I wanted to press charges.&nbsp; They had two options.&nbsp; One is I could accept financial compensation from Mochby's family (he sure didn't have anything...not even what he took from me), or I could press charges which would have meant an extended stay in St. Petersburg.&nbsp;This man was not going to lengthen the time I spend away from SZ...not gonna happen. I didn't want his family to have to pay me either, as his family did not rob me and I suspect they need their money more than I did.&nbsp; I requested as compensation that Mochby write me a letter of apology, including an explanation of why it is wrong to rob people. This I would have accepted and been satisfied. In the end my request was not taken seriously, and I never received any letter.&nbsp; His father came at about six in the morning and offered me about 10,000 rubles.&nbsp; I only accepted 2,000.&nbsp; I honestly would have preferred the letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would have been the greatest souvenir.&nbsp; I don't think I had more than 700 rubles when I was robbed anyways.   So I didn't get to bed until this morning, and slept the day away.&nbsp; I'd planned to go to the Hermitage this afternoon, but woke up rather late for tourism.&nbsp; Perhaps I will visit it tomorrow.&nbsp; I never suffered any serious injuries from the attack, and no blood was spilled.&nbsp;&nbsp; My cheeks are a little swollen today, and I had to eat my lunch slower then I prefer to.&nbsp; But I imagine in a couple days I'll be good as new. I guess I have to thank God for foiling the plan of the robbers he sent.   July 21, 2004   I just gave myself a tour of the Hermatige, the main museum in St. Petersburg and once the&nbsp;winter palace.&nbsp; So much gold!&nbsp; The walls, the frames, the chandeliers.&nbsp; Everything is gold. Too much gold can be so tacky.   I don't know how many cathedrals I passed on my way here.&nbsp; This town is so full of them, and they are all so immense.&nbsp; Do they really need so many immense cathedrals?&nbsp; I wonder if they compete for congregations like synagogues around Washington? Yesterday I visited the Kazan Cathedral, an old mossy Cathedral near my hotel, created in a Roman style like the Lincoln Memorial, but significantly bigger.&nbsp; After walking around inside and admiring the artwork for a couple minutes I was informed that the church was closed and that I needed to leave.&nbsp; Also to 'hurry up'.   Since he said 'hurry up' I felt obligated to head towards the door at a particularly slow pace.&nbsp; When I arrived at the exit a man had already locked it, mumbling at me in Russian as he directed me back inside the church.&nbsp; The boy who told me to hurry up escorted me to the other side of the cathedral, where a trap door was opened and he led me down the winding staircase below.&nbsp; How exciting!&nbsp; I was led through the cathedral's underbelly, where dozens of numbered doors marked the hallways, which I concluded&nbsp;were residences of the clergy.&nbsp; Eventually I was led outside.   Last night, at the convenience/liquor store&nbsp;across from my hotel a young man named Cossi started carrying on a conversation with me in Russian, where my role consisted mostly of staring at him.&nbsp; Every now and then he stopped as someone walked by and would try to get them to buy him a beer or cigarettes, even though he had both.&nbsp; I bought him a beer just for the entertainment.&nbsp; He invited me to sit down and hang out with him on the windowsill, where others were sitting around enjoying their beers. The beers were passed around, multitudes sharing bottle after bottle.&nbsp; Among the folks was a man named Poshek and his mother, who were residents of the block which included my hotel.&nbsp; I didn't catch the old woman's name, but her smile from under her&nbsp;head scarf presented a lot of joy at making my acquaintance.&nbsp; There's something very comforting about old women when I travel, as they tend to be the greatest testimonials to modern history.&nbsp; Although none of them could communicate in English, my frequent smiles were communication enough.&nbsp; The beer kept being sent my way, even though I didn't want it.&nbsp; I tried to turn it down but nobody would accept that, so I took small sips and passed it back.   Eventually it started raining and Poshek and his mother went into their home, leaving me with Cossi and another fellow.&nbsp; So I sat around for a few minutes and eventually retired to my room, making it an early night.&nbsp; It was still light out.&nbsp; It was nearly midnight.

						     Name the musical.     Well, today has been much as expected. We didn't stay at Dremo's very long, as so few people showed. K dragged me to see JWS on the way home, which once again was pleasant with the ignoring and the backhanded insults and such. The carpet is gone from JH's room, or at least no longer attached to the floor, so tomorrow I should be back in the groove of working a bit, goofing off a bit (repeat as necessary) for the rest of the week. Nothing more exciting than laundry is planned, but that means little in these parts.    I'm braindead right now, so I will proceed to the letter. I have lots more to gab about, but nothing appropriate to the present company. The cat's not such a good listener while she's eating.   Oh, one more thing. As it's past midnight, I should wish all a happy  urlLink Tu B'Av . Tah.  July 19, 2004  I made it to St. Petersburg.&nbsp; It's been a challenge. The 12 hour train ride was nice though.&nbsp;   I bought a first class ticket since it was only about $15 more, and I think it was a great choice.&nbsp; I ended up with a private room on the train, with my own couch, table and bed.&nbsp; It was fabulous! At one point I took a walk through the train, which was quite a horrific experience coming out of first class.&nbsp; Several first class cars were placed along the front of the train, followed by the dining car.&nbsp; Then I saw them....the poor people who were in the second class cars.&nbsp; They were spread out all over the seats and there were layers of them.&nbsp; It was like watching a narrow glass filled with cockroaches, each one trying to climb the neighboring bodies to make their way to the top.&nbsp; They tossed and turned with such aggression that I could not bear to watch, my emotions forcing me to turn around and run back to&nbsp;my first class cabin.  First class was not without its problems, and that doesn't even include the trashy European techno I was forced to listen to over the P.A.&nbsp; The train attendants kept knocking on my door to see if I needed anything, which I found to be a nuisance since nothing they had to offer was free.&nbsp; I locked my door.&nbsp; However, the attendants all have keys, allowing them to knock, unlock and open the door all within a second.&nbsp; So that is what they did.&nbsp; A frightening predicament to be in if you want to enjoy the luxury of your first class cabin without the obstruction of pants.  Arriving at the St. Petersburg train station was a trial.&nbsp; It took me a moment to get out of the train, as I was all comfortable and wrapped up in my first class room.&nbsp; If I hadn't&nbsp;spent some time studying the Russian alphabet before this trip I would have been in quite a bit of trouble.&nbsp; Signs in English, while present, are kept to a minimum.&nbsp;All I had was my Lats, no Russian rubles.&nbsp; I found an exchange desk but they didn't accept Lats.&nbsp; However I did find an ATM machine, where I obtained 4 one thousand ruble notes.&nbsp; One dollar is about 30 rubles.&nbsp; The next mission was to get a phone card so I could call around to the hotels.&nbsp; However, I discovered that buying anything in Russia when you only have thousand dollar notes is a challenge.&nbsp; I only found one kiosk selling phone cards, and when I showed her the note I had she closed the window in my face and motioned for me to move on.&nbsp; I went around trying to buy a Pepsi with my note so I could get change, being sent away from several shops before I found a fancy restaurant and ordered a Pepsi.&nbsp; Then I got my change.&nbsp; So I got my phone card.  My guide book had the hotels listed at about $12 a night.&nbsp; I called around...they were all from $100 a night.&nbsp; Something was very wrong.&nbsp; After unsuccessfully calling around I gave in to a hotel that will run me $120 a night, and went looking for transportation to it.&nbsp; My book said that a taxi ride across town runs about $2, the drivers wanted $15.....and from looking at my map it would have been a somewhat short ride....certainly not a ride across town. So I became acquainted with the metro system (which took some time to locate), deciphering the Russian text to figure out my route.&nbsp; The ride on the metro only set me back a quarter and took me right to the hotel.&nbsp; The hotel turned out to be much fancier then I expected.&nbsp; I took a hot bath when I got there, drying off with my clean white towel.  I looked for something to eat before I found this internet place.&nbsp; I found a kiosk selling pancakes which you could have filled with meat or vegetables.&nbsp; After a difficult time explaining what I wanted I was asked in Russian if I wanted it here or to go.&nbsp; (Someone in line translated) This threw me off because it was just a kiosk on a corner. I peeked behind the kiosk and there were some people just standing around munching on their pancakes.&nbsp; Russia is weird.

						    Well, I'm back. I know, y'all missed me.     &nbsp;   Wondered why I didn't write yesterday?&nbsp; Well, I didn't get back from the weekend trip until afternoon, and then life kinda got in the way.     &nbsp;   My brain is still fried from the weekend, which involved mostly drinking and TV watching. It's amazing how my brain shuts down when I don't move around all day. It's a good thing I've been working on the house, or I'd be a gibbering idiot at interviews.&nbsp; It was a great deal of fun, though. It's nice to be surrounded by Philes sometimes, if only because I don't get those weird looks when I quote the show all day. Then again, I&nbsp;enjoy the&nbsp;weird looks sometimes.     &nbsp;   Last night 'Screen on the Green' began on the National Mall (it's an outdoor movie thing) and they showed  All The President's Men.  Ah, Robert Redford in his heyday. SIGH. Anyway, the Posse, AD's Boy, her cousin, and JH attended, and it was a wonderful time. We always seem to be the people who talk through the whole movie, and sitting on a blanket outside is a much better format for said commentary.   &nbsp;  When we came back from Roanoke, I left my wallet in AW's car, so I had to retrieve it earlier. When I was preparing for the drive I took a look around (again) for the car charger for my CD player. Definitely gone. So on the way home I stopped at Target. I heart Target. While there, I also purchased the new Jimmy Buffet. SO good. I heart Jimmy. There's a whole lotta love in this house today.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I have a letter to post, and JH will be here soon to move things in, so I'd better go work on cleaning up and pulling the carpet out in JH's room. Hope to see all at  urlLink Dr. Dremo's in Arlington  tonight.  &nbsp;  July 18, 2004  &nbsp;  I'm waiting for it to be 7:30 so I can catch my train to St. Petersburg, where I will arrive on Monday morning.&nbsp; 5 days ago I bought a plane ticket to Krakow from St. Petersburg, which did not have an e-ticket option.&nbsp; I ordered overnight shipment of the tickets to my hotel in Latvia, but 5 days later they&nbsp;had not arrived.&nbsp; I'll have to go to the LOT airline office in St. Petersburg and remedy the issue.  &nbsp;  I got a chance to swim in the Baltic Sea yesterday, though the weather was rather cold.&nbsp; The sand felt cool to the soles of my feet, but the water was not so bad.&nbsp; Paulina and Otto, as well as Richard and Uma (another pair within my elite Latvian social circle) watched from the shore.  &nbsp;  You've got to love Paulina.&nbsp; She walks through Riga with such control that you can't help but respect her.&nbsp; She has always got her set of boys that follow her and yield to her every wish.&nbsp; Suddenly I find I am one of those boys. Otto is a fun guy, and reminds me all too much of the queer divas that think they own the club.&nbsp; He makes a good pair with Uma, who reminds me of one of those Russian girls that went to my high school who take considerable effort to make sure their dress is always in high fashion, yet it was a fashion that never quite fit in Rockville, you could hear the Black boys at school making fun of them if you listened carefully.  &nbsp;  I enjoyed Latvia's honesty, where people will be friendly if they choose to, and are just as comfortable not being friendly.&nbsp; They have an amazing&nbsp;way of never greeting strangers in passing, yet being able to maintain eye contact with a stranger until they are out of immediate view.&nbsp; Latvia is a country that is rich enough that people can live as comfortably as they choose, yet poor enough that the people still maintain an honest and open heart.  &nbsp;  I never saw any drugs in Latvia while I was here, even while walking through the casino ridden streets late at night.&nbsp; A woman in her late 40s who looked to be in her late 50s offered a "massage", but no drugs have been presented.&nbsp; I want to say that Latvia seems to have successfully thrived without drugs becoming embedded within the lower class culture.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; Girts mentioned his fear of the people who shoot narcotics, though people who shoot the likes of heroin are the last people you need to be concerned about.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the minds that crave cocaine that often find themselves doing the regrettable.&nbsp; Heroin addicts would just as soon take a nap.  &nbsp;  I wasn't very impressed with the marijuana I had the opportunity to smoke legally in Amsterdam.&nbsp; I find marijuana to be generally rather enjoyable.&nbsp; Certainly if it was legal and appropriate in the United States I would much prefer to smoke it at a black-tie affair (like the men do in Jamaica) than I would embrace a vodka tonic or a glass of rotting grape juice.  &nbsp;  Otto says that Roxy, the club I went to&nbsp;Wednesday night, has a lot of drugs.&nbsp; I didn't see any drugs but I did see two guys walk out of the same toilet stall.&nbsp; The setup of the club did look very drug-user friendly.&nbsp; I could imagine myself at 18 sitting on one of those soft, velvety couches in the chill-out room indulging in the intensified sensory experiences of pleasure, the musical rhythms massaging every nerve in my body.  &nbsp;  Amsterdam offered the opportunity to have a psychedelic trip, as psilocybin mushrooms are legally available at various 'smart' shops.&nbsp; Every day, as I passed one of those shops I considered revisiting the experience, but every day I felt no desire.&nbsp;I'm with Paulina now, and I plan to soon meet Otto, Girts and Richard who will see me off. On to Russia!

						   I'm off to Chicago tomorrow! Or today, as it's just past midnight.   As I mostly did trip-prep today, and neglected the basement, there isn't much to report. Probably won't post again, but I may sneak one in just before I leave the house. In the meantime, enjoy the TWO! Letters, and I'll see y'all on Tuesday. If I get a chance I may post while I'm gone, but don't hold your breath. Oh, and note to our more sensitive readers: the first letter is rather heavy.   July 26, 2004  SZ really upset me my first night in Krakow.&nbsp; We were walking back to the dorm of a Krakow University where we have had a double room, when&nbsp;he said he saw a woman taxi driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't see her so I requested we turn around and go back.&nbsp; When we got to the taxi, I approached the driver to request a ride to our dorm.&nbsp; When she turned to face me, her profile giving away a full frontal view, it became incontrovertible that the driver was actually a man. It was a big let down because never have I ever seen a woman taxi driver.&nbsp; I've often seen them driving buses, but never a feminine figure behind the wheel of a taxi.&nbsp; All&nbsp;around the world I have never seen a woman taxi driver anywhere, and was inflamed with excitement at the opportunity.   Leaving St. Petersburg was uneventful.&nbsp; I accumulated another gift from a group of drunken bums.&nbsp; As a going away present they gave me a poster of a woman out of a Russian porno magazine. I gave a few gifts myself.&nbsp; Tamara had broken one of her shoes and asked the morning of my departure if I could help her acquire a new pair.&nbsp; I had already placed a 1000 ruble note in a cigarette box and told her that it was a magic cigarette box.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was to ask for a wish and open it.&nbsp; She asked for a pair of shoes and opened it, then proceeded to kiss me on my right cheek followed by my left.&nbsp; She did did this again.&nbsp; And then again.&nbsp; She also said it was enough for her to get a ticket back to Kiev. Tamara invited me to come to Kiev sometime and stay with her.&nbsp; I doubt it will happen though.&nbsp; I have become uncomfortable with overprotective overbearing types.&nbsp;   Though she wasn't the only one who was overprotective of me.&nbsp; Even the young punks would become overprotective when they became concerned of another poor Russian's intentions, or if I was walking towards a pole.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to be a regular occurrence that if I was walking with people, and their was a pole in the sidewalk ahead someone would put their arm around my waist and direct me in a path away from the pole.&nbsp; Perhaps they think that tourists are unable to identify the danger of walking into poles while in Russia.   There was one incident when I was walking with a group of punk boys and Joseph (the thief) was approaching. I pointed out to Alex that the guy ahead was the one who robbed me and gave me my black eye.&nbsp; Jenni, another guy grabbed Joseph when we walked past and two of the others began to punch him.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they held him I was invited to take a punch, but I only spit in his face.   Actually that last incident never really happened, but I often fantasized about it.   So the first night SZ and I went to a club, where at one point I wanted to escape the hot building and went outside, standing in front of the building.&nbsp; Two guys approached the area, smoking a joint.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said something to me, and I replied that I only spoke English, which increased their interest in me.&nbsp; They didn't speak English but managed to ask if I wanted any cocaine.&nbsp; I didn't.&nbsp; Then they invited me to "come around the corner with them," to I presume a less populated side street where they could have their way with me.&nbsp; I replied I wanted to sit where I was.&nbsp; So then they asked me to come up the steps to the club, which was several floors up.&nbsp; I replied I only wanted to sit.&nbsp; They continued to try to get me to go with them, so for the sake of avoiding another robbery attempt I needed to get back up into the club without them following me.&nbsp; I asked how much the cocaine was, then told them my friend upstairs had money, so I had to go up and get some.&nbsp; They looked rather annoyed that I didn't have money and allowed me to go with the promise that I would be back in 5 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;We left a little over an hour later and they were gone. SZ thinks I'm crazy for thinking those guys wanted to rob me, however I'm pretty sure that was their intention.&nbsp;   We are planning to go to Prague tonight.&nbsp; In a little while we will go on a nature hike towards the mountains of southern Poland. I haven't done anything nature yet unless you count swimming in the Baltic Sea, but that had a rather suburban Riga feel.   We went to the Auschwitz Museum yesterday.&nbsp; I wasn't expecting to be moved by it.&nbsp; Throughout my upbringing I have been saturated with education on the Holocaust, the most intense lessons in Hebrew School, where I&nbsp;saw films of suffering vistims.&nbsp; As a result I have become desensitized to feeling mournful.&nbsp; However, being at the actual concentration camp did get into my skin a little bit.&nbsp; As I ran my hand across the death wall where the firing squad would shoot rebellious inmates, I could hear the gunshots and feel the hopeless bravery of the victims whose blood drenched the wall.   The most intense&nbsp;moment was in the gas chamber.&nbsp; I stood alone in it, allowing my eyes to follow the line of pipes which once dispersed Zyklon B to a room full of victims.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and could hear the sound of gas ejecting from the pipes.&nbsp; I could hear people scream in terror, and children crying in response to the screams of the elders.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and the tips of my fingers throbbed from the nail marks that once attempted to cut their way through the concrete walls.   I peered my head into the ovens of the crematorium, and could smell the ghostly scent of burning flesh dropping through the bars in the form of ashes.&nbsp; I ran my hand across the bottom, and examined the black soot that came up on my fingers, wondering if it was the ashes of an old distant cousin or just the dirt that comes with half a century of dust accumulation.   July 28, 2004   Too bad about St. Petersburg.&nbsp; No sooner&nbsp;had St. Petersburg became the most beautiful city I have ever seen (I'm only talking functional cities...Ancient ruins don't count) it has been replaced by Prague.   Walking through Prague is palace after palace, beautiful site after beautiful site.&nbsp; You can stand in one spot and marvelous castles and cathedrals wink at you from every angle.&nbsp; St. Petersburg had them lurking around every corner, but I was nowhere that I could see several of them at once. Standing on the Charles Bridge last night was the most beautiful view of architecture that my eyes have ever admired.&nbsp; Castles all around, statues everywhere.&nbsp; Cobblestone roads flawlessly maintained.&nbsp; Though I could have done without that neon replica of the Eiffel Tower that stood at the top of a hill.&nbsp; I don't think my literary tongue is quite clever enough to give Prague justice in a description of it's beauty.&nbsp; Perhaps at some point I will remember to bring a camera with me while walking around.   My first meal wasn't impressive.&nbsp; At a little restaurant outside of the hostel we stayed at on our first night a woman invited us to check out the menu.&nbsp; After some indecision she highly recommended Lagos, describing it as a crust with tomato sauce, cheese, onions and garlic.&nbsp; It sounded like it might be good so I tried it, being it was one of the only meatless alternatives.&nbsp; It turned out to be a slice of bread covered in ketchup with shredded cheese sprinkled on it.&nbsp; It was caked with garlic and onion powder.&nbsp; While I was eating it she smiled at me and asked if I was enjoying it.&nbsp; She seemed really proud of her culinary creation.&nbsp; It was like something I would have made when I was seven, but would have eventually grown out of making it because it sucks.   On our last day in Krakow, SZ and I went into the mountains that look down upon Slovakia.&nbsp; There was a 20 minute cable car ride to the highest peak, however I didn't have enough Polish currency to get us there and they didn't accept credit cards.&nbsp; So we had a nice hike climbing the side of a mountain with no use of paths or stairs. Holding on to handfuls of grass and the trunks of trees we were able to make our way up among the foreign flora that we appreciated as we trampled over it.&nbsp; It's the way SZ and I always climb mountains.&nbsp; Perhaps someday we will use paths.   We took a night train to Prague.&nbsp; Not finding a car of our own we shared one with a couple from Britain (the male of the set was a Pole named Szymon) and a grim looking middle aged Polish man who sat folded in the corner and never spoke.&nbsp; Szymon left the car and returned with 6 beers.&nbsp; I accepted one.&nbsp; Later the English girl knocked a beer over and the remainder of the ride was accompanied by a floor completely covered in beer.   We're exploring Prague.&nbsp; Last night we walked for several hours around the city, being accosted by promoters of strip clubs and prostitutes.&nbsp; One of the prostitutes was quite aggressive, grabbing my ass and other private parts while following me for half a block with her hands remaining where the sun don't shine. The prostitutes on the streets of Prague are a bit of a phenomenon.&nbsp; They are all young and pretty.&nbsp; I expect most prostitutes to be rather disheveled and of various ages.

						   With JH's room nearing completion, I returned this afternoon to the project which began this glut of home repairs; sound-proofing the basement. I finished Roommate/Landlord's bedroom today, and began work on his living room. Fun times. I've had to shower twice today, once after the second coat of polyeurethane went down, once after completing the insulation for the day. It's been worth the dry skin, though. As soon as the upstairs is done JH can move into his room, and he won't follow me around all day looking for company - I hope. He's a very nice guy, but I prefer not to be monitored so closely. He did help with the insulation, though, so I can't be too hard on him.   Here's the obligatory letter, sanitized for your protection and edited for time and content. Not really, but I've been watching too much TV lately. Enjoy!   July 23, 2004   I have been&nbsp;unable to find the moon.&nbsp; Once I realized in Latvia that I hadn't seen it for a while I began a nightly quest to find it.&nbsp; I've asked some people about it, and they say that I will be able to see the moon...but not tonight.&nbsp;   I think I miss the moon more than anything.&nbsp; Perhaps soft toilet paper too; and&nbsp;a toothbrush.&nbsp; I have one, but it's so bent out of shape it's not good for much.&nbsp; I've been keeping my eyes out for a new toothbrush but I haven't been able to find one.&nbsp; I refuse to believe there is no market for toothbrushes in Russia.&nbsp; I also miss toe-nail clippers.&nbsp; The problem of overgrown toe-nails probably could have been avoided if I had cut them right before I left, but I didn't, so&nbsp;I'm suffering from overgrown toenails and I have nothing&nbsp;I can use to cut them.&nbsp; Perhaps I should file them.   My cheeks are not as swollen now, although their puffiness has moved from my cheeks to underneath my right eye, where a black eye reveals my experience.&nbsp; However, in Kazansky Park it serves as a battle scar that automatically establishes a good seat in the homeless Russian pecking order.   I have received a few Russian souvenirs in the form of gifts, eliminating my need to purchase anything for display in the classroom.&nbsp; One is a square wooden religious relic, featuring a picture of some saint.&nbsp; This was given to me by Dema, a drunken bum who is forever repeating to me that he is a hippy.&nbsp; The second is a thread bracelet covered in aluminum can tabs that feature the names of various countries of Western Europe.&nbsp; This was given to me by Andres, a young addict who Tamila feels it is her duty to watch out for.&nbsp; He says it is an important punk symbol.&nbsp; The third is a bottle of Axe body spray.&nbsp; Young women in tight black shirts and orange hot-pants are strategically placed around St. Petersburg handing them out.   Tamila has been living roughly in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; She stays at her sister's flat but has no money she can use.&nbsp; She does have some in a Ukrainian bank but she cannot get to it.&nbsp; As a teacher her salary in the Ukraine is the equivalent of $40 a month.&nbsp; This is sufficient to live simply in the Ukraine, but not enough to both go to St. Petersburg and eat.&nbsp; Her daughter is studying to be a medical doctor where she will receive a salary of about $100 a month.&nbsp; Tamila spoke of the days of communism, where her teaching salary was enough for her to travel all over Europe and live the kind of life she wanted.&nbsp; Since the fall of communism she has been reduced to the life of a poor peasant.&nbsp; She answered&nbsp;the question&nbsp;I most wanted answered on my trip to Russia.&nbsp; Were there homeless people in Russian before the fall of communism like there are all over the place now?&nbsp; She said no.   The Russians I've been hanging out with are constantly saying things to me in Russian, then assuring me that it was just a joke. The drunken bums all have war stories to share of experiences in Afghanistan or Angola.&nbsp; They have the same breath as the drunken bums who tell stories of Vietnam.&nbsp; I heard one punk kid today do an impression of Beavis & Butthead.&nbsp; How the hell do Russian kids know about Beavis & Butthead?   St. Petersburg has proven itself a diverse community, full of men wearing tsit-tsit and a surprisingly high frequency of Asian faces.&nbsp; Men are occasionally seen holding hands, though I think this may be the influence of their Arab neighbors.&nbsp; There are a ton of shwarma places but none of them serve falafel, and everything I order to eat has found some creative way to include pork. I had the best falafel in Europe while in Riga.&nbsp; I found a little place that actually even served it with hummus at no extra charge.&nbsp; It turns out the woman who ran the shop in Riga was an Israeli from Haifa.&nbsp; Figures.&nbsp; Israelis know how to make a falafel.   Tamila took me to see some bridge open last night, along with Alex and Andres.&nbsp; Apparently an opening bridge is a big deal.&nbsp; Tons of people were gathered around and cheered upon it's opening.&nbsp; Drummers and fire-eaters were around for the occasion too.   I'm off to Krakow tomorrow.

						   Well, the first coat of&nbsp;Polyurethane went down on JH's floor today. It was supposed to be done on Friday, except that I couldn't find any in the house, so I had to&nbsp;drive to Home Depot this AM and get some.   Speaking of driving, I don't think I've been so sick of Rhode Island Avenue in years. Today I drove K on an errand before work, but it could not be completed. The original plan was that I would then drop her at the office with her Monday co-worker veggies, then come home and redistribute the rest of the corn etc. we brought back. As her errand was not completed, we drove to her office, dropped off veggies, then drove back to complete the errand, which could still not be completed, so we dropped off corn and melons&nbsp;to our town hall and a local church, then completed the errand, at which point I drove her back to the office, then went to the&nbsp;Hope Demot.   The first coat went down, but the fumes are too bad to put on the second coat yet. I tried to clean up, only to discover that we had no mineral spirits or equivalent, so I had to run BACK to the HD with sticky gunk all over my hands.  If nothing else the floor finishing is an excellent excuse to clean up a bit. Boy does this place need a good cleaning. It's gross. When the floors are done, though, it should be great. I'm very excited.   JWS watched the animals this weekend, and I'm very disappointed in the job he did. They're usually bad when we first get home, and on Monday morning, but they were so freaked out it was obvious that they'd had no company all weekend. Not to mention a couple of accidents, which point to the fact that they did not go out often enough. We're pretty sure he only came by once, Saturday night around 6. Keep in mind we left at 3 on Friday and came back around 9:30 Sunday. Poor animals. Even the cat was awful today, and she has an indoor bathroom.   Anyway, hopefully he'll do a better job while we're in Chicago.   [Several Hours Pause]   I'm watching the Democratic Convention right now, so I'll just insert a letter and go back to the TV. Just thought I should get the 'afternoon' post out before midnight.   July 22, 2004   I called travelocity yesterday, and confirmed that everything had been arranged for me to pick up my ticket at the St. Petersburg airport.&nbsp; Everything was A-Okay.&nbsp; Way to go American technology!   It was a challenge to find a place where I could make a phone call to California though.&nbsp; I knew a place near the hotel I stayed at on my first night in Russia, but that's on a far end of town.&nbsp; I looked around the nearby blocks, but couldn't find anything.&nbsp; So I thought I'd ask for help from Cossi, whose name now gains another consonant: Cossti. He could be easily spotted bouncing around the 24 hour liquor store across from my hotel.&nbsp; I tried to pantomime my request to him, but his response was primarily for me to bow my head so he could brush off the dandruff.&nbsp; He knew I was looking for something, and managed to catch the attention of a passing young man who spoke English.   His name is Alex, a student from a town outside of St. Petersburg who came to the big city to squat in the park in front of Kazan Cathedral with other punks and hippies.&nbsp; That park always reminds me of my original adventure in San Francisco, where the gutter punks and hippies and generally disfunctional youth (as well as old drunk bums) would gather and pass the days away in the park.&nbsp; Alex led me to a place where I could make some calls to the US, and invited me to take company with his band of punks and hippies in the park, passing around bottle after bottle of cheap wine in a clockwise rotation.&nbsp; Cigarettes were always kept in the center of the circle, available for all to take.&nbsp; I think I am the only person in Russia who doesn't smoke.&nbsp; One of them started to ask me for money, and was yelled at by the others for his behavior.&nbsp; One of the old drunk bums who goes by the nickname of Daddy made a kind gesture at me by pulling out his pocket of change and throwing it into the bushes.&nbsp; Another man went on a scavenger hunt for the coins later.   I saw them again this morning, and offered a bottle of cheap wine that I bought specifically for them.&nbsp; Included in the circle today was Tamara, a vacationing foreign language high school teacher from Kiev, who spoke almost perfect English.&nbsp; She has a list of places she plans on taking me this evening, including an opening bridge that allows a spectacular view of St. Petersburg and a dance show at a Russian theater. So I've spent the afternoon with the crowd of punks, hippies, bums, and non-discriminate citizens who shared their wine, cheese and cigarettes as they struggled to make me laugh with a joke about a young mammoth who had a rumble with a skin-head elephant.&nbsp; One of the men wants me to meet his daughter. Oh, Russia.   &nbsp;

						   I HEART the Cruel.com site of the day. After two recent negative rental experiences with Enterprise, I am pleased to present  urlLink this link . Try ANY other rental car company first.  No other input today. If anything happens other than insulation and my continuing cold, I will post tomorrow before I take off for the weekend.  Squirrel Out.

						   I was talking about Friday night, wasn't I?  Friday night we'd decided to go to a club in Chicago. AC took a pass, but one of SES's friends from Argonne, a guy named blue-haired M, decided to be our fourth. We got a late start after the delay at the airport, and got a little lost in downtown looking for the club. We were headed to Excalibur. We finally found it, and found parking, when SES realized she could not find her ID. We had to go all the way back to Argonne to get it, at which point M decided he'd had enough for one night and went back to his room, leaving us to return to the city as a threesome. On the way SES mentioned that she thought M had a crush on her, which K and I had both noticed already. Thus explaining why he'd come for the car ride, but not gone dancing.  Once we got back to Excalibur and got inside, we had a blast. We got hit on and asked to dance and outright groped so often in a 3-hour period it was just insane. In addition to the dance floors and the lounge I mentioned, there was a diner in the basement and a few pool tables. We took a break from dancing for a quick game of cutthroat, and even got hit on down there. Finally we headed home when they kicked us out, and went back to SES's place to drink a bit more and tumble into bed around 5.  Saturday morning we all got off to a slow start, but did eventually get to downtown Chicago on the train (after SES directed us to the station). We played in the new fountains at Millennium Park, walked around a bit, then headed to Lincoln Park. For those not familiar with the Windy City, this is a very hip neighborhood, and also where Blagojevich HQ was when I worked on his gubenatorial primary campaign. We walked around there for a bit, then went to see the Polkaholics at a bowling alley, and bowled for a bit. The Polkaholics are a polka-punk band, and they were pretty good in addition to being as campy as the description entails. We headed back just in time to catch the last train out our way. We missed Venetian Nights, but the less crowded atmosphere of the bowling alley was better for AC, and also gave everyone time to talk and catch up. Plus, it was good campy fun!  We mostly made it an early night Saturday, as we wanted to get to downtown earlier on Sunday. We ate a quick breakfast, then headed back to Millennium Park. After getting drenched, we walked Michigan Ave, went shopping for souvenirs, and visited Navy Pier. We left around 9, as we were planning to go back and barbecue. We cooked up a few hot dogs, roasted marshmallows, and played cards. Blue-haired M also came over for a bit, proving that he did indeed have a crush on SES. We made sure to mention her fiance as often as we could.  AC went to sleep around 1; I headed to bed around 3, as I had been feeling under the weather all day. K and SES stayed up until 6:30, and slept until about noon, so we didn't have the chance to get to Buckingham Fountain before we had to head to the airports. We all said goodbye to SES and she headed off to work, while the rest of us got ready to go. We went to a late lunch at a diner near Midway before dropping AC off and returning our rental car.  The flight home was uneventful, and we were happy to make it home a little after midnight Monday. The animals all had empty bowls, and there were a few accidents, and K's Mom's flip flops were eaten, but basically they were okay. At least they were all still alive. JH wasn't home, and didn't make it in until Tuesday late morning, so I checked on his cat Stripey, who seemed okay and had a little food left.  All in all it was a really great trip, it was great to see SES, and meet her friends and AC. SES even invited me to her wedding, which surprised me as I'd thought I would either not go or go as a guest of K's brother. I guess she likes me. Good thing, because we have mutual friends, and personally I think she's just great.  Anyway, that's the trip. I'll post a letter at some point so we can work on catching up, but not just now. Latah.

						   When I said I'd see y'all on Tuesday, I had no idea it would be this early, or that I'd have so much to tell and no idea where to start. I suppose I should just begin at the beginning, and stop when my fingers get tired.  On Thursday I woke up relatively early, put up some more insulation and cleaned up the basement a bit, showered and put a load of laundry in, and sat down to read and kill some time. Our flight was at 8, so I had some leeway to get the last few things done, which were mostly laundry I did not have to pack and cleaning the house. I took a few quick breaks from my book for food and switching the laundry. At 3, I got a voicemail (the phone was right next to me and did not ring) saying that our flight had been cancelled and I needed to call the airline. So I panicked. I called and found out when the rest of the day's flights would be, then called K to ask how soon she could possibly leave. They got us on what the woman said was the last flight of the day, but as opposed to a direct flight to O'Hare, it connected at La Guardia. Last time I was at La Guardia I was flying to and from my Grandma's funeral, so this did not bode well. Also, the flight was at 5, and it was already 3:15. I called K, and she left work to run the last few errands she needed to do before she met me. I got JH to drive us to the Airport, picking her up on the way. We then missed an exit because we were both freaking out and didn't give JH proper directions. We finally got to the airport with about 25 minutes to spare, only to find out when we checked in that there was a direct flight leaving at 7:35. So there we were in the airport with much time to kill, still really freaked out about the whole thing.  We arrived safely, and got the rental car (we had to upgrade, because even though I requested a 4-door, they tried to give us a 2-door; and I was not about to make a pregnant woman climb into the back of a 2-door compact) and got to Argonne National Labs rather swiftly and safely. The mapquest directions we were following took us there the long way, but it wasn't even a worry at that point. We met up with SES, who we were both very excited to see, and the three of us hung out for the rest of the night, staying up until a ridiculous hour.  Next morning we woke up early to see SES off to work, then K and I went in search of the train station ( we couldn't find it) went grocery shopping, and went to the guest computer lab at Argonne. I would have posted a bit, but I didn't have my passwords with me. We met up with SES around 7 back at her place (we stayed with her since her roommates were away) and went to pick up AC at Midway. It's fortunate that Argonne and Midway are close, because there was a lot of traffic, and we only had an hour. We made it with about 20 minutes to spare. The boards were all screwed up at Midway, so we couldn't figure out whether or not her plane was on time, and after a while we had to go to the counter to check because we didn't see her and it was after 8. We finally figured out that she was waiting at the gate, because KCI is evidently an old-style airport design, with separate entrances and waiting areas for each gate, and she'd been waiting for us at her gate because she didn't know we couldn't go back there.  We had planned to go drop off our stuff, then go to a club for some dancing. Poor AC is 4 months pregnant, and she was just too tired and stressed to join us. It was a shame, because she'd gotten dressed and all before she decided to stay in, and she looked really cute. Also, once we got there it turned out that they had really nice lounge areas and she probably would have been fine to just sit and enjoy the music for a few hours. It was great music, too.  Well, I think I'm past my allotted finger pain threshold after being away for such a spell. Tomorrow (or later today as it were) I'll go into more detail about Friday night, and the rest of our trip. Right now, I'm very tired. Sleep tight Lovies.
