        Why, you seem to be Woodstock. Woodstock is the smallest of the Peanuts characters but has a big presence for a little bird. He's a little inept, his flying and logic are erratic, but he can type and take shorthand and usually is game for anything Snoopy wants to do. Although he's the butt of many of Snoopy's practical jokes, he's the beagle's closest friend and confidant- and has made attempts at retaliation. Because of his size and the company he keeps, Woodstock is an accident waiting to happen. Being a bird and tiny, he gets a little insecure around Thanksgiving and big moving objects. He's the only baseball player who gets an automatic walk if the ball rolls over him. Woodstock talks birdspeak only, and finds an alphabet made up entirely of exclamation points quite adequate to express such emotions as distress, frustration and a real temper. His flocking friends are Bill, Harriet, Olivier and Conrad.    urlLink   Which Peanuts character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        Snuffy's Suicide Attempts    Poor baby, life is rough for you, huh?  No one seems to see you, no one notices your pain--except for your friend Big Bird, but he's alway off hanging out with his other friends. You wish you were him, all happy and curious and popular and bright yellow.  You feel like his shadow anymore, like the only reason you exist is to amuse him.  It's hard being somebody's imaginary friend.  But stop trying to kill yourself--imaginary people can't kill themselves.  Sorry.  And hey, maybe tomorrow you'll feel better! Someday people will see you, I promise.    urlLink   Which Sesame Street Muppet's Dark Secret Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
