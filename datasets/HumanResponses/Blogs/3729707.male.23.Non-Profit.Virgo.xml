      1:45PM and I'm at work. Only 5 more hours to go and I will be enjoying some nice relaxation.  Hung out with Mike and Helen last night in bizzaro world.   "That's why there's three in the bag." - HC  One IS the loneliest number. Two can be as bad as one; it's the loneliest number since the number one.  Saw my mom this morning. She stopped by after hitting up the TotalWomens Gym. Called me "stranger". People are strange; when you're a stanger.

      I've been missing my cat lately. His name is Squiggy and he's a little black fur ball. So while I miss him, I found something to make me happy. Enjoy!   urlLink http://gladstone.uoregon.edu/~dcalwhit/cats.html

      "We are the music-makers,  And we are the dreamers of dreams,  Wandering by lone sea-breakers,  And sitting by desolate streams;  World-losers and world-forsakers,  On whom the pale moon gleams:  Yet we are the movers and shakers  Of the world for ever, it seems..." -Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy  "Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee Jest, and youthful Jollity, Quips and cranks and wanton wiles, Nods and becks and wreathed smiles Such as hang on Hebe's cheek, And love to live in dimple sleek; Sport that wrinkled Care derides, And Laughter holding both his sides. Come, and trip it, as you go, On the light fantastic toe; And in thy right hand lead with thee The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty; And, if I give thee honour due, Mirth, admit me of thy crew, To live with her, and live with thee, In unreproved pleasures free ..."

      Ah the morning. I was woken up today to the sounds of my chinese roomates arguing in Mandarin... Such a beautiful language for an argument. The male roomate just knocked on my door only to stare at my laptop. He says "computer?", points to it, and then points to his head. I assume he is refering to the fact that a computer is like a brain. And in fact the Mandarin word for computer is "electronic brain". Pretty funny.  Last night I met some cool friends of HCs. We smoked a little, flapped a little, and I watched some chess being played. It was pretty sweet. They seem to be good people and I hope we get a chance to hang out some more. Very rare to meet new people (at least for me). Good times. The owner of the hangout had a nice rug, which really tied the room together.  Work soon. Drink first. Got some Moretti beer from Trader Joes. That's a good beer. Back to drinking it.  PS: Odelay - Beck dictated the title he had chosen to the person writing down the name of his next album, originally to be titled Ã“rale (Spanish for "tell me")

      On the second day he created a blog. I made this only so I can get some GMAIL invites (for the shorties) but this may be a fun way to write a macho-diary as well. Kudos!  So it's my day off. HC gets off work soon so we will soon be one. There can be only one. I'm thinking of having us test some Salvia D. today as I just got some for free (thanks FARK). We'll see how that goes.  Just downloaded some Cenobites. I was waiting for two weeks for this archive containing a full stuido album. It's pretty sweet. Check check check check, a' check it out!

      Saturday. In the park. Think it was the tenth of July.  HC is on her way her right now. Jogging. Been a long day full of meetings and greetings. Had sushi for lunch. Nice.  Things work out for the good.

      So a tweeker chick comes in to Radio Shack. She wants to activate 12 lines of service. She has a briefcase that she keeps pulling papers from. Claims that she has identity theft issues and has to "get a new social security number every 90 days". Ok... So she just keeps rambling about nothing, very Courtney Love style. The last thing she does before leaving is hand Ali a card. On the card is "S. M. Kia". So I check Google and the only SM Kia is some scientist that has written papers on some random subjects. Maybe she is SM Kia and the government gave her enough LSD to turn her insane. All because she knew too much... Or maybe she just needs to get back to Riverside. Either way.

      I'm so sad and lonely. Sad and lonely. Sad and lonely. Ain't got nobody. Nobody cares for me.  There's a new ad on TV for a Van Halen Best Of. Contains new and old Van Halen (aka Roth and Hagar). During the whole commercial we get to see all of Van Halen playing... except David Lee Roth. Cunts...  H broke up with me again. Keeps telling me what a horrible person I am. Life sucks.  Look like next week I will get some female teenage roomates. Living it up Jack Tripper style. Now my only worry is who to cast as Larry and Mr. Furley. Rob or Tom would make a good Larry, but I think the job may go to Andy (who is in town for two weeks). H's dad makes a good Chinese Mr. Furley. He's Mr. Ful-lee.  So I got to hang out with two high school chums this week and I ran in to a third. Small ass world.  Well, back to the grind.
