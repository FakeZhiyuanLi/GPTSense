      i'm such a pig. i've hurt becca so bad. i do feel very terrible, ohh, man. i went out and got some action, but in doing so stupidly boasted about it to becca. damn i kicking my self right now... i do like her, but there have just been all the times she has messed me about many a time and i saw past it, we really lacked the physical side of things that really got to me. i'm not bothered about fucking her or anything i just wanted to kiss her but i couldn't cos i was just so afraid that she would push me away, as it has happened before... gawd. i would like to go out with her again, yes i would. but i don't feel like it at this moment in time, perhaps when she gets back from holiday i dunno tho, if i can wait that long...  i'm going into downham wednesday, if you can come we can talk. i do wanna straighten things out, i would hate for things to end terribly now... i am sorry.

      bloody hell. well folks its officially over. tuesday night i recieved an e-mail that has dealt a crippling blow to my heart. becca broke up with me. in a way i feel soo relieved, but more so than that i am now feeling really down. i really really wanna cry. but damn my manliness, my tear ducts have long since dryed up.  today i was smiling and laughing and acting like i hadn't a care in the world but it hurts soo much. i can do very little that doesn't remind me of her. we are still friends, shes a good mate and i would be in an even worse state if we were no longer friends. the other year i went out with this other girl who was on my bus (scarily she was called rebecca too!) and she was a good friend, but then i sorta screwed things up when i got into her panties on the bus, not a good move to make, especially when her best friend was sitting behind us and her sister infront of us! afetr that i was pretty much distraught for weeks after.  we have said that we'd see each other and we'll keep in touch, but i feel if were to see her i'd either be completely fine on the out side and falling apart inside or i'd just break down crying. shit its stormy out side! i probably screwed up my history exam today cos i was thinking about her, oh well i don't really care about history. just did the subject for the trip! ahh buh! i started writing a sad song earlier then i just started to get me really upset, not good, i promptly stopped that activity. my mum said earlier, oh well plenty more fish in the sea, and i said, not very many special ones.  goddammit! beccas gonna read this nd get upset. DON'T!, just leave me rant on about it, it helps me get it out of my system.  aww man i hate this time after a relationship. did you know i have never dumped anyone. my problem is i'm too nice and scared to do anything for myself, if it means that there is the remotest chance it could upset someone. but isn't it funny, it took me soo long to pluck up the courage to actually be able to kiss her with out the aid of intoxicating substances, and on the day she wanted to dump me.... and now its too late.  if we end up going to a gig i'm just gonna be sitting there longing for her. i put soo much into our relationship, just to recieve very little. any chance that i did get was either ruined by some unseen force or i just couldn't do it. sigh, bloody sigh, i wish could cry. i mean tho the amount of effort and time i put into this, i put her first everytime over myself, gave up pot for her, forgave her for kissing another guy, let her just ignore me as she talked to other people, even put up with not dancing with her at the prom, just to make sure she was happy, because if she was happy i felt happy too. i wish i could cry, myself to sleep.  well any way history exam was one hell of a bitch, really hard, i missed a few questons oh well, it was the last one so it burning school uniform time! he he he !!! went round eds, got high played on da ps2 and i played on his guitar, the one thing other than my friends that makes me happy and good about myself... night all i'm orf to gings for the next few daysso i won't be able to update this for a while. ta ra!!!!! oh i do rant on don't i!!!

      well today was stupat, 2hrs 15 min physics exam and i couldn't remember half of the stuff in it, manly cos my mind kept drifting onto other things, oh well... it was the last exam for most people today so i had all of the teary goodbyes, no mre cav, aaron, and others sigh, meh i'll see em about... didn't get to say bye to beccs had to get the train home and my exam was longer that hers, so i just eneded up sitting about getting bored and eating sweets with the gang.  any way i wanted to talk about other things.. oh yes! pot, is a very big issue on my mind at the mo. mainly because of becca. now i have no problem not having it for her, its just i seem to mixed messages from her sometimes... right lets go from the beginning... the first time i ever had it she was therewith me on that hallowed place we call the bandstand in lynn. she would come over then begin to get angry then said 'nah i don't mind and it was ok all night' then the next day she was all like i'm annoyed at you because i did it, but i kept saying she said that she didn't mind, so that died down. i now thought that she didn't like it but wasn't too bothered that i did it, every thing was fine. then a few weeks ago, before strawberry fair, she said that she didn't want to come along cos we'd all just get stoned, i told her that i believed that no-one who was coming with us would have some and at that time it was true, and in my attempt to try get her to come along i over emphasised that no-one would have any, almost to the point of it being deffinate. when we did get to the station we did meet up with somepeople who did have some anda happy day was had by all.   then after that becca found out and said how really upset she was about it, now heres me not knowing that this ment soo much to her so this was a huge shock to me and since that day i haven't touched any at all, even though there have been numerous occasions when i could, i went against my friends who pretty much respect my decision, all for  her. but the other day, i really don't know if i imagined it or it actually happened, i believe i heard her say, i feel like getting stoned, or something along those lines, quite a shock to me. i told her the other day that i haven't touched any for too weeks and she was like two weeks isn't much, wtf? its been two weeks since i've stopped and i probably first had it about maybe 6 weeks ago. and whats more i would just like to have a bit of encoursgement from her, just like when i told her the other day its been two weeks for her to say well done or something...  i have soo many people have just said to me too just do it and don't tell her, even from her friends! but i wouldn't do that, it would weigh down too heavy on my conscience, so in my mind i have decided that: i won't do it every day, or when we are sitting about in the middle of exams/ in the day, i won't do it if she is around especially, i meen in a party situation, i will only possibly consider it if if it is a party and i'm bored and she isn't there. like the other day, i just got soo bored with jakes party i would have liked some to lighten me up and enjoy it more... and with drink she has said to me that she doesn't wanna drink as much any more, then i read on her blog that she doesn't ever wanna get drunk again, which is fair enough, but why couldn't she just have said that...  right what else... just quickly if you notice that in this ere blog i have said something about her parents not letting her out, and then she commented that she also had other resons and that she did n'twant to come out for other resons too... well i only said that becase she had basically made it out to me that her parents were acting up and not letting her out, so for her to whip round like that and say that is quite a shock. she has said to me that she asked her parents alot and that they wanted to do stuff on those days, i'm guessing that these other reasons are about her not feeling good at the mo, but she could have just said that if thats what is was doesn't have to go into detail, but just something... also i really feel soo terribly sorry for her, she is soo bad at te mo. something like shes anaemic, has a bad lung, pmt, and she is feeling depressed, there are probably other thing but i won't drag on, we were walking along the street she was in agony, man i feel so bad to see her this way, i really hate it, i just wanted to help her somehow, but i cant thats the worst bit. i mean why her she really isn't a bad person, even though she says she is, she is lovely, oh man i'm getting all teary. it saddens me to hear her say the things that she says about herself, she is funny, smart, a great friend, very attractive, she makes me soo happy, yet seeing her like this makes me soo sad, and now the exams are over for her i'm hardly gonna see her again, i have no money, i can't go round hers, when her parents are about, and as she is feeling bad doesn't what to come round here. oh its not fair for us especially her, she really doesn't deserve any of this, why? WHY!! i mean all i wanna do just for once hold her in my arms and share a good long kiss with her, just once at least, but as we hardly get any time alone and every time someting comes up its always squashed, ohh i feel so down now...

      oh yes finally i've managed to get back on here!!  we the past few days, hmm sounds familiar... well saturday, jakes partay. pretty lame, i wanted to get drunk, but they drank all of the nice stuff so i ended up drinking half a can of carling, not nice. jake ordered me to put ice cubes in the freezer at half one in the morning. him and his mates wouldn't listen to the simple fact that the ice cubes would not have frozen until about seven that morning. that was the final straw, so i made a loada toast, a cup of tea and pinched some bicuits and had my self a feast in my room. i also half watched this film about spinal tap! how funny was that! they had amps that went up to 11, it was funny. then as i was about to get to sleep, they all came up with sticks and started to poke me, then one of them clambered onto my bed and proceded to lay on top of me.  the next day they were all gone by 11 so we had the rest of the day to rest. dave (my step da) met kim and black form the pixies!! he ses at V we are gonna have to try get back stage and meet them again.  today food exam, what a joke, i really couldn't care less about that exam! oh well over and done with now, hey, i only threw away about 40 marks. then afater that, burning stuff on the howdale, walking around, walking around some more. me an becca took ging to the train station, then after that we went to the river bank alone. we only stayed a few minutes.  now we have been going out for four months now, brilliant, but we hardly get any time alone. today was nice because we did, i liked it. also i like to be alone then its just me an her, and on this river bank it was. we sat down together, now i wanted to kiss her, there and then. but i find it real real hard to do so even though she is my girlfriend. the only times ive ever kissed her before is when weve been drunk, that annoys me, and i'm am so afraid that she will just push me away. something that has scared me is that a week or so ago i dreamt that i went to kiss her and she pushed me away and walked off leaving me alone. that has got to be one of the scariest dreams ive ever had, not just cos she is my girlfriend, but because i feel it could happen, and it scares me that i think that... i really wanna be able to kiss her more, its hard for me to make the move, because a while back she went was all like 'don't touch me' i know why now, but that was scary. and when we've been out before she has ran off away from me to go hug other people and practically ignore me. this is one of the harshest things ever, at our prom she would even dance with me, man that, ouch. well anyway i sat down next to her wanting a good kiss, whilst she looked the other way from me and fiddled with grass, this was difficult because a) she was facing the other way and that isn't easy to for a kiss and b) i felt blocked out. well anyway nothing happened and we moved on i told her that i had wanted to kiss her, i had very little reply... we then moved up to the howdale so we could be ready for the buses. again we went and sat down alone. this time i eventually managed to sum up the courage to go for it, and yes, i did it and wahts more she responded. excellent. it was only like a small peck but damn it was good! just the fact that we were sober, and she kissed back made it. ahhhhh!!! after it i said 'finally' what a plonker! of course i was refering to me actually being able to do it.   ok i do have more to say but i mst be orf to bed as i have exams tomorrow.  pot, saturday and image, just to remind myself what to write next   nite all!!

      fooking hell im bored, and to make it worse i'm pissed off, mainly because i'm soo bored, but also cos ma gf (not guardian force), becca, can't come round today, and i was really looking forward it. its not her fault, but her parents. ugh. its not fair its been ages since we've been out any where, mainly cos i have no money, and we live miles away from each over, too far to bike, but when we do we hardly have any time alone, that annoys me.  well hopefully her parents are going off sometime next week, knowing my luck my parents will probably act up. we've been going out four just over four months now and we never get any time alone, it pisses me orf, big style. but its not really our fault, more the awkardness of where we live and parents etc. grrr. now is the perfect time aswell cos my parents are away in italy, and my bro is throwing a party this evening. sigh.  poor ole becca isn't feelin well either.i really feel sorry for her she does have it hard sometimes, i wish i could help but there isn't much i can do... seven hours till jake gets back and the partay begins, all alone till then. all i can do is tidy up, listen to music, play my guitar, or, to be rather blunt, wank. i think i'll listen to music, i'm bored of the three options, all alone.... liam was ment to call but has forgot oh well.... he might call later to check out the partay, he said the other night that him and craig had some spliffs, i'm off them you see, cos becca don't like it, if they do come i may do it.. i dunno... i haven't had it for a few weeks now, even though i've had multiple chances, its a party though, just having fun, we'll see what happens... lets see who is on messenger... ugh takes too bloody long... oh just as i thought no ones on, of course its a saturday, everyone is out and about having fun or working, everone but me..........   I WANNA HUG!! ;_;  excuse me while i go hurt myself :-(

      Sprinting up the slippery battlement ramp, Private Johnson reached his post. Usually the planet Chareen was a huge, bright, lush forest, but for today it had been plunged into an almost eternal darkness by an evil so terrible. 	When Johnson reached his post, with gun in hand, he froze where he was standing, unable to move his limbs, his face white with terror and his heart missing a beat purely due to the sight of what was bringing this planet into darkness. He saw huge multi-limbed monstrosities with massive scything talons, drawing themselves at unspeakable speeds towards the fortress. Around the huge monstrosities were millions upon millions of lesser creatures that were four to five feet long, with gun-like limbs firing at the battlements. They scuttled between the bigger ones, like ants in a colony. In the air were millions of small winged creatures that were blackening the skies like a storm, they were like the ones below but in other ways completely different. These were just a few of the creatures that made up the sea of death all around the fortress. He felt a tapping on his head. âCome on soldier letâs kill this bitch,â screamed the sergeant over the thunderous roar of gunfire. âItâs a good day to die.â After the Sergeant tapped his helmet, Johnson, still with an expression of shear fear, brought his gun up and fired upon the enemy doing as much damage to the sea of death as a peashooter onto a tank. 	The immense engulfing sea of creatures crashed into the frontlines, consisting of many tanks and thousands of men, like a wave crashing into a cliff. After ripping through the frontlines, like a tsunami the horde tore through what was left of the forest, towards the fortress, reducing the forest to a pulp.  Behind the havoc, hundreds of bombs splashed into the sea of beasts, like large stones being thrown into water, and just like water, the craters filled up in the blink of an eye. Firing wildly into sea of creatures, Johnson prayed to the Gods that this torment would end and that he could be at home with his family. Men were constantly falling and being replaced around him after being hit by the hideous living ammunition of this most grotesque foe that was destroying this world which he had come to know as home. Many of the casualties that were happening around Private Johnson were friends of his that he had known since when he had first joined the spatial infantry. Johnson did not realise the end of his colleaguesâ demises because he had been trained along with the others to focus only on the battle and to forget everything else. Johnson and his other comrades had no experience in the field of this sort of warfare, they had been used to fighting small groups of poorly armed rebel guerrillas, who couldnât fight their way out of a paper bag. Suddenly the horde smashed into the battlements, after leaving no trace of the frontlines or forest, it was obvious that the walls would not survive this pounding much longer. Johnson decided to fire at one of the larger creatures, and whilst aiming down his gun barrel, the creature seemed to, just then, flick its many beady eyes at him. Time seemed to slow, as he focused completely on the one creature that seemed to be focusing on him. His eyes moved a fraction to the creaturesâ gun-like limb that was staring at him, it fired a salvo of living ammunition from a hulk of flesh, at him. In response to it firing at him he fired at the creature. But he was hit moments before. The force of the hit knocked him onto the floor whilst his gun fell into the swells below. Tiny black-headed worms bored through his flesh to his spine, whilst Johnson writhed in agony, screaming out his pain for all to witness and behold. From the spine the worms bored through flesh and bone, relentlessly working to his head where they would indulge themselves on his still functioning brain. Thinking and feeling nothing else but that of the extreme pain that was surging throughout his body, Johnson clawed at his back moving up to his neck and ending at his head, attempting with no success to remove the invaders from his body. His life force slowly dripped from his body as the gluttonous creatures devoured his brain. The worms greedily finished his body, after the brain was no more, leaving nothing more than a husk.   The sergeant ordered Johnsonâs ID tag removed and his body disposed of. Lieutenant Marson took his place against the terror below. Later the next day all that was left of the planet Chareen and its inhabitants was a rocky ball floating through space on its continuously repetitive orbit around its star. The living colonial ships of this gruesome enemy, pivoted toward its next target and propelled itself there, content and fed well, after another success.

      eek its the 15th, thats my lucky number...  as i write this ai am wearing a bright red t-shirt, my sexy blue tye die  boxers and my haggard slippers.   damn i hate exams they are soo homoesexual. i mean they like to get jiggy with exam papers of the same subject. only three more. pfft another four hours of exams for me probably more. i hate the current education system its sucks big time. probably all to do with my rather bad outlook on the whole school thing. i don't really care about alot of subjects, i.e. ICT, food, french. the list continues. i haven't revised for any of these subjects and i have revised very little for the ones i care about. my problem is i get distracted easily, too easily...  anyway when ever in your day to day life are you going to stop and work out trigonometry to help you through a crisis, oh a ladder, your putting up a ladder and need to know how far away from the wall to put the ladder. ahem, WHO FUCKING CARES!!! i could care less. in fact i do. i mean i like sciences simply, cos i find them intersting. not maths (shudder) its gay and our teacher was a ho. she'd ask a question to the class and no-one would co-oporate. hilarious. i think that our year has got to be one of the worst. the exam results for our school have been increasing over like the laast ten years, ah ha! not this year! they're goin right down! brilliant.  oo eer ive written alot, and i just ment to add in some more before i went to bed. any who its too bloody hot to sleep, and the cats have probably invaded my bed, i'll put a pick of my fat bastard of a cat when i find out how. oh! he made me punch myself in the face earlkier, the maniacal bastard! i shall kill him d'arr! i'm suddenly a pirate!  night all
