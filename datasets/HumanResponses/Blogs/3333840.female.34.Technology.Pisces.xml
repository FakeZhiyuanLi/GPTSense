       I found a coworker's cell phone within arms distance and the third grader which normally runs my day to day events, completely took over. I said to Paul, "Call me so I can record the number." The coworker it belongs to spent the AM talking on the office phone on the left ear while holding his cell phone to the right ear. It's annoying enough dealing with pagers and blackberries going off all the time but do I need to share my workbench with 'Mr. Two Phones' aka Yves?!   So I suggested to Paul that he place Yves cell phone in his pocket and walk around our area as I called the number. As we expected Yves hears the rings and pats his body down, checks his pockets and looks all around himself. The phone stops and I dial again. This time he looks around himself and asks, "Do you hear that?"! Of course I'm laughing as he beings to search his laptop bag and jacket pockets. Paul is standing near Yves talking to a user when I dial a third time! This time Paul, obviously distracted tells the user that he's holding Yves' phone in his pocket. She laughs, Paul laughs and I'm nearly out of my chair laughing when FINALLY Yves catches on!  Yes, we're that childish and find this to be one of the funniest jokes EVER. I know, we need to upgrade our lives or maybe we really are computer geeks after all..............

       Don't I need a place to sound off?! I'm so offended it's not cute. For months I've been dealing with a certain Vendor and it's been one major headache. It's getting to the point that they're losing our business. However, my supervisor who is hardly ever in the office or deals with these people just got invited out to Joseph's for lunch. This has to be the best place I've ever eaten and the only place where I can actually eat seafood from! How dare they not invite me?! Plus, it was my supervisor's day to buy my lunch (we take turns buying for one another). To make matters worse, a coworker and I went to Joseph's "DUTCH" for my birthday. Since I never carry cash, I put the bill on my VISA, which was a total of $150. I have yet to receive her $75.00. For those of you who don't know, my birthday is in March!  In other news I was offered a $10 per hour raise. Yes, it does come out to $400 per week which is an excellent amount of money if: 1) I didn't wait over 16 months for this raise and if 2) My position wasn't about to terminate! However, I am very thankful for having a job of any kind at this point. Especially, one as flexible and satisfying as this one.
