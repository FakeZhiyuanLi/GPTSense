      By popular demand....:  e pommel family( to the tune of the addams family):   (chorus)dadadidum (clack clack) dadadidum (clack clack) dadadidum dadadidum dadadidum (clack clack) :  the shingchee and the eric, and guoren and the jinhan, the powder and the pommel, the pommel family. (chorus)  in the corner of the gym, they make their little home, its really rather humble, but its very comfortable. (chorus)  the captain's name is shing chee, he's good at taking penalties, dont diss him cause he's short because he's scored from 50 feet.(chorus)  the vice cap is called eric, his hair is very neat, dont diss him when he slacks because he's fourth in the gym meet. (chorus)  and then there is the guoren, he's loyal to his country, he's famous for his denial, when he said 'IT"S NOT MINE!!' (chorus)  and then there choy jinhan, he heads the LKC, he's good at keeping penalties, or rather letting in. (chorus)  and then there is the pommel, it's stoning in the corner, it wonder's when it's gonna be used, not in the next few weeks. (chorus)  the powder's in the bucket, the slacks are in the closet, the team is playing soccer, and coach is rather pissed.(chorus)  the shingchee and the eric, the guoren and the jinhan, the powder and pommel, the pommel family.(chorus)   kewl right? =)  of coz its outdated because it was made in march..now there r like 11 ppl going for pommel...but im nt gna create like 7 more stanzas for every1......unless..i have too much time which probably isnt going to happen in the near future

NOOOO~! its now stuck in my head. aRgh!!!!   then after we get our wristbands, we'll proceed to queensway to make our gym tee. dotz. hopefully that is, not that we have the entire design ready. crappp

      this just a reminder to the people out there who are reading this: this blog's aim is simply for&nbsp;fun joy peace laughter.&nbsp;it is not  1)a site specially opened up to villianise anybody or to mock anyone, simply because im not, and i'll like to believe we're not, the type of people who cant take anybody getting the better of us. please dont feel that we go out of our way to insult and put down any organisation, anybody, or anything, cause this isnt the case. Nor is this  2)a site to glorify ourselves and to prove how 'team'&nbsp; and united we are, and how great everything Raffles is.&nbsp;we dont need to do this, thank you very much, because&nbsp;at the end of the day it wouldnt make much of a difference how anyone else felt about us. i dont need to go into the&nbsp;'this is my blog and my place to&nbsp;write and i have freedom of speech' and all that blah. case in point: do u think we're gna change our sch colours or our leotards to pink and purple anytime soon? (ok we were only toying with the idea tts all). the colours should be casting a light and scherzo atmosphere around this place, not flooding this place wif ridicule and scorn towards other people. so once again, i'd like to remind everyone that it isnt much point getting offended over anything u see here, because its to take for bird bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. tt's all. maybe when other people see this theyre gonna have more to say or think, but ur not going to change the fact that we're posting our personal thoughts a memories here, and its pointless getting worked up over anything.  gdnite.

      ok this is the first time im typing an entry here for dunno how long. this is mainly because  1) i had nothing to say 2) when i had something to say i wasnt near a computer so i cldnt type it down. this explains my hiatus here. 3)when i had finally gotten onto my computer i had a dicey internet connection which lets me use msn but not i.e. now its decided to be consistent and its not even allowing me to access the net at all. grr.  jemtan says e results for agm are out on monday. so we'll figure out who's capt. and vcapt then.  dont believe jenhan when he says he screwed up his c.t.s i have arnd double his l1r5 so he's isnt in much of a position to complain ha.  for a while there i was wondering whether the left side of the blog was more stupid, or the right side. finally its swung back to the left side, mainly because the tagboard disappeared on my screen. weird ^o) but maybe someone did something about it. or my computer really hates me. this entry doesnt have much in the way of organisation but sometimes scattered snatches of thoughts can work out too i guess. ha. maybe it doesnt have too much in the way of humour..but since jenhan left there wasnt too much funny stuff tt happened in boarding, save.. daojie trying to make the tree outside sweeter by throwing mentos and other stuff outside.&nbsp;so there was fruitplus on one of the branches and mentos scattereda round teh bottom.  boonshing getting a recording of me singing vindicated. its william hung style so u hafta hear it to believe it. standing outside the window and wondering whether i wld fall out. it wld be a fitting end anyway-who's stupid enough to stand outside a 3rd storey??  on the last day of boarding daojie and boonshing tried to strip me bt tt was so blody hopeless too. because 1)skeletons cant match horses in terms of horsepower??so i&nbsp;ran out..but since i had to&nbsp;go back&nbsp;anyway when i climbed back they started again,&nbsp;and 2)when i gave up struggling they accused me of being gay and waiting for them to strip me..so it wasnt intersting anyway.  maybe i should restart my attempt to get into rj. i.e. start mugging. blah. my interenet's not even working.

      i am very sian   urlLink  http://share.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=EeJuHLRs2cm    dig this.   anyway heres a list of what happened in my life so far  1. screwed up CTs 2. study  boring.   lets talk about my great legacy. *drum rooolllllllllllllllll* THIS SITE!!!  so after 4 years in ri, i have left behind this great site for all future ri trampers to join. not only does it promote team building, it also provides an avenue to break a leg and be lame.   ah yesterdays rythmic gym comp. overall it was sian. not surprisingly, since i din understand a thing abt ryth gym. i just cant appreciate dancing without a few sommers. andy was being his mean self and commenting on *ahem*.  then after we all, andy horse boon daojie and i, went to orchard for dinner. we decided to eat crystal jade since everywhere else was damn ex. turned out that i paid 15 bux for my meal. 1 bowl of porridge and dessert. the porridge is damn good man!   so here i am stoning. im terribly bored after trying to study chinese. boring.&nbsp;i shall attempt to screw around more. gdnite

      hoho. just look at the tag board. (to ure right) i think our board is gonna be flamed. apparently boonshings pictures are not very well liked. oh well.&nbsp;what can i say? apocalypse and the guy hu cant find his daddy have every right to be pissed (whichever school they are from)! i mean, if i were from chs, i wud be quite pissed too. it would be better if u guys stopped posting INANE posts like "ri sux" on the tag board. and 10 times at that. i have NO trouble reading, thank u very much, id like to say the same abt u too. if u want to flame, do it with more finesse.   A QUICK TUTORIAL TO FLAMING   1. never leave ure real name  u haf grasped this fast. the more stupid the better. eg. apocalypse: oh u are gonna destroy me. help! who's ure daddy: a good name to taunt ure opposition by questioning hu their daddy is.   2. go round the bush   "actually ri is quite good la. just that we're better.&nbsp;see! other people are braver than them,&nbsp;proving so&nbsp;by jumping down 3 stories, so u see its always the balless people who whine."  3. sarcasm would be lovely  "OK LA. ri is DAMN good."  so basically blogs are meant to put down our true feelings and the colourful side of our lives. if anyone feels offended because of the content, then dont whine. since u can bitch and whine abt our blog on ure blog. got it? =)   &nbsp;

      Woah! I must say that I haven't had as much as I had with you guys on Friday in a long time. Being with the whole RI team makes me feel old, and yet makes me feel young again at the same time!    The whole meal at Seoul Garden was just a crazy affair! All the madness cooking on the metal plate was just insane! And to think that it wasn't so long ago that mixing rubbish at Seoul was something that my friends and I used to do.    Cherish your youth guys. You all won't feel invulnerable for much longer (case in point the swimmer who thought he could fly Mhuahahahahah!) so make the most of it! My RI days were the best. Always brings a smile to my face when I look back on all the rubbish I did haha! Oh to be young again...    To the Sec 4s, it's not over yet! Don't forget you all can still take part in A Div! So freaking hell all of you please sit down and start hitting the books! The O's won't count for much in 10 years time, but right now it's the most important exam you all will be sitting for, and I can't stress that enough. So don't screw it up! You know you all can always come to me if you all need anything.    To the Sec 3s and the rest of the young ones, make the most of your time in RI. Train hard, study hard, go after the pretty gym girls and have fun! I'll pop down for training and competitions as often as I can.    Let's kick Chinese High's ass next year!

      since boon gave his end-of-gym-comp speech, i'll give mine too. this comp yr has been&nbsp;a fun one for me. esp the tramp team. we rawk. =) thx 2 all of us we became real lame. but it was wad made trg fun. apart from all the scolding i got, it really cheered me up at times. i juz wanna thank the sec 4s - jenhan and jingheng, for scolding me (sounds real sadistic). well, at least i got a decent 8.30. the sudden thought of the sec4s leaving, and we becoming the nxt batch of leaders scares me a bit. lyk there was andy or jenhan all the while, and we didn't haf to worry much cuz they were always encouraging us, esp during comp. it was them hu bonded us well. and now, we're gonna take over, and it feels real scary to me. hope dat we will do well to replace them. jingheng wants me 2 be better than him. dunno if i can do it.  &nbsp;  as for boon and daojie, my fellow b div ppl, we'll excel nxt yr rite? i tink we juz need 2 be more confident. look at ph lor. he sure looks confident lah.&nbsp;more confident&nbsp;than any of us. it's b'cuz of our lack of confidence dat we flop. let's not complain bout chs anymore lah. wad's done's done. let's work hard to even conquer the judges' biasness ya?  &nbsp;  owells. may ri gym, esp tramp team, do well nxt yr. ri tramp rawks. to sji, u ppl rawk too. u sure are a fun bunch of ppl. quite evident in yesterday's seoul. lol. ur as lame and crazy as us. see u guys soon!  &nbsp;  p.s. boon u very bad lor *points down*

      not surprisingly..chinese high swept all the golds! well why not? they're good. the judging juz made them look better. ah well..its all over. aniwae to everyone who competed : well done! u guys made this year's competition one to remember.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;so friday marked the last day for the sec4 batch as being an ri gymnast. quite sad tho. training is gonna be so awfully weird without them.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  to horse and jenny : ah..i dunno how to thank u guys. u all certainly made trainings more interesting for me..relays..bottle throwing..laming around..yea man u guys rawk!i remember sec 1..when i came in horse was a nice patient senior..jenhan and andy were rather mean but i guess without them being mean..standards would never have been reached. in fact..i remember for a period of time i really hated andy and jenhan for being so mean..but now im really thankful to them. thank you for being there when i needed u. thank you for teaching me during trainings when no one bothered to. thank you for ur encouragement and scoldings..it really helped. thank you for all the fun trainings we had together. we were the strongest team this year. we know that. not only were we the best in terms of skills, our team spirit was the strongest.&nbsp; its not about the result, rather, its about the process.&nbsp;achievements&nbsp;will juz be a nice bonus.  i'll remember that. =D&nbsp;btw..next yr rj's gonna be real near ri..really hope u all can come for trainings more often =D. and jingheng! u better get into rj!!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  on a lighter note..ytd night we had a combined celebration dinner with sji gym team. it was really a fun night to remember. some people were mixing raw food with egg yolk..add some spic and some watermelon. and..muahha the deadliest concotion to cause instant tummy ache! we really had fun disturbing the other people ther. =pPp muahah..we rawk. hope to see u guys next year yar? to shawn lee, sean tay, javier, timothy, perry, alvan, isaac : u guys rawk! really nice to be knowing u all..yar..rawk on!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  and then talking about boarding..seriously..every week of boarding is full of shit. this week..we almost got another operation asswipe..juz that this time we managed to unclog the toilets ourselves! so..no more overflowing/regurgitating toilets that gives u lots of laughter and lots of phobia. (phobia of stepping on shit that overflowed). then ytd nite it was raining damn heavily. the rain was blowing into our room and was irritating me like siao. so..i covered my blanket over me. ok..for a while it worked..until i realised i&nbsp;cldnt sleep with the noise. so i snuggled closer the the wall which&nbsp;was away from the window. it worked for a while too..but..well..the rain still splattered in..so..i snuggled closer to the wall..haha now it worked. then..horse got up and was cursing smth like.."u all are asswipes lar.." then he closed&nbsp;his window and stepped on my bed..closed my window and gave me that u-asswipe-never-close-ur-window look. *oopz* i really like how my mind works when im sleeping..my mind concentrates on getting back to sleep rather than make my sleep even more comfortable.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;o yar..jenhan..u asswipe! y u only board 3 weeks? gonna be..sooooooooooo borring. dotx.

      ok everybody has been goign around posting their own thoughts, thanking all the other people arnd them, and slamming everyone else around on their tagboards so its time for me b4 i go collect my specs and go back to boarding.   'I wish we never had to choose,  To either win or lose,  That we could find a way...'    ri/ex-ri ppl:  im so proud of u c div. just like last yr nobody counted on u to win. but u did amazingly well. i know some of u got fairly emotional after u ur competition. just wanna say its totally alright as long as u dont get too wrapped up with it. nxt weeks is the artistic comp, for the artistic ppl do ur best again like this time round and nobody will blame u for everything. i know we've said b4 ur training attitude was fubared and all, and to be honest i still dont think too much of it now. but im sure u will all rise up to the challenge and mature after the whole thing is over. u have to. keep the flag flying.  b division, i know we know they know we were the mightest team that day but it just wasnt to be. u know that nobody is blaming everybody because we're all 1 team. nxt yr jenhan n i wont be arnd too often( im nt even sure whether i'll be arnd at all) but its important for you to  bounce back from this  and emulate this year's performance. and remember its the process that counts, not the result.  and to all the old ppl who came back: like xavier, big ming, fats, and andy too. u all were the moral boosters of it all because everyone still remembers ur era and im sure that u had encouraged us all the way and supported us. i cld tell by the scandalised faces when jenhan's score came out how bloody disgusted u were...even though u've got no official affiliations with ri anymore...i guess thats one of the few things that set ri apart from some other schs. thanks for being there ppl and esp andy: thnx for e encouragement yelling and coaching frm sec 1 i had doubts about joining gym in jc but after this no more. we'll pown nxt yr.   sji ppl:  its been a quite a fun time this yr because u ppl are the greatest; u've got the nearly the same training ethic, lameness, determination as us! its been another year with a similar result, and it ended wif a similar cheer (*grins*). look forward to dinner a taka on fri night..n greater interaction wif u guys in time to come..both as sji and sji old boys...:D   chs ppl:  i have really nothing much to say to you about you. just that im really happy im not from chs...its like win n ppl villianise u. lose and ppl still villianise u. aint a nice life i admit.  in general:  this year has been a nice roundoff.  sec1: appealed into gym from rv(choir). got shunted/pushed/put into tramp at the end of the year.  sec2:screwed up my c div with a single facedrop but got a screwedup score anyway. just like jenhan felt demn jacked n cheated coz of e team bronze.  sec3:screwedup so bloody badly and kinda cost the team gold.  sec4: screwedup only slightly; i personally feel i did quite well overall.  but its all the team that counts in the end. we've really embodied team spirit in a way i never thought would be possible in gymnastics. we've epitomised grit, determination, enthusiasm, fun. we've trained bloody hard and finally i've done a routine during comm i cld be proud off. maybe there are ppl who think its gr8 tt we've pawned us..maybe there are ppl arnd who think we've losers because we cldnt even sniff the gold in 3 years of competition..to those ppl i suggest u go rethink ur thinking.   'Stand tall; Stand proud!  Voices that care are crying out loud.  And when you close your eyes tonight,  Feel in your heart how our love burns bright.'

      hey guys we WON our bronze man. relax about it. tchs may have got the gold, but hell, we know we have the best team around. it is bloody OBVIOUS. ok i shall not try to sound like a sore loser and bitch about how swimmer sux and how the judges are biased. coz if i do, ill just be branded as a sore loser. if u want to know what i think, ask me. if u dun like my opinion(read chs) then dig it. C div, u guys werent expected to win, to be honest, but u guys really did damn well. yu bo!!! oman seems like all the pple i scold the most end up alright(read jordan and yubo). well done daojie! looks like we still have someone to carry on the ri tramp tradition after boon and jordan. better rebuild ri tramp and recreate the golden generation. shit man, ri tramp has so many legendary teams. (bigmings era, xaviers era, andy's era). a div comp was quite good. for once there were so many teams. shawn lee is pro man, i really respect him for his dedication and sheer power. sprain his ankle so badly during shi chang di still can get 9.5 for comp. shenz. andy dun feel too bad, theres still next year and if we make it to rj, we'll form a team, and its gonna be a tough job stopping us. hee.  so basically we lost the gold, we had 2 major screw ups, without which, we still wudnt have won. so there, no need to feel sad. i dun blame u guys for screwing up coz no one is perfect and i know too well how u feel. but we really showed them this year what we're capable of and next year, ri bdiv will have a damn good chance of winning the gold. im really proud of u guys more than i can say man. our moves were way sweet this year. i cant say we deserved to win this year considering how we screwed up during the comp but we definitely did look like a champion team during the warm ups. no point crying over spilt milk, and that includes me, work hard next year and u guys will own, as in seriously FOWN the competition. dun worry me and jingheng and andy will come down often(i hope) no matter which jcs we go to.   anyway this years comp has been a really good experience for me, apart from the FUDGES. ri and sji renewed our frenship and its really cool having a fren on our side.  "why ri and sji always got pple cheering for them and we dont?" overheard from some chs guy  oh well. i really dont know. honestly!!!   met many cool guys at this years comp. sean and jonathan u guys rock the socks man. comp wudnt be the same without u guys. it was really fun tokking kok abt weird gym injuries and of course, our 100 m freestyle champion swimmer. *evil laugh* its cool that we're having our gym celebration dinner together at seoul, and we'll be seeing each other alot next week.  thanks loads mingwei, xavier and alvin for coming down to support us. ure guidance has always been appreciated and always will be. i dunnoe how we would turn out so well if it wasnt for u guys being there for us when we needed it the most.  and so ends my 4 yrs in ri gym. so lets recount the memories.  sec 1: innocent sec 1. hated artistic, blardy weakling, and totally loved tramp. ended up in tramp, wonder why eh. sec 2: became quite good and everybody was expecting me to do well, went to chiangmai, lost it all. screwed up during comp and got my score slashed out. felt blardy jacked. sec 3: got over my sommer phobias and cud do a decent b routine. competed and got a bronze like in sec 2. sec 4: this year. we totally owned. training was damn fun and tramp culture has never been better. i got the same score as i did last year for a more zai tao. oh well.   our team this year has been the EPITOMY of stupidity, zainess and lameness. but above all our team spirit is really our greatest strength. only when u have great team spirit, will everyone do their best for the team, to be the best they can be. that is what matters, not some metal piece, altho like jingheng says "it would be a nice bonus"  boarding this week was equally full of SHIT. operation asshole last week, and this week....*drum roll* we present....  OPERATION ASSWIPE! today jingheng crapped, flushed twice, then it choked. din spill though so we thought what the hell, might as well be stupid. took a video of us running in the toilet and flushing the toilet till it flooded and all the shit spilt all over. hhohohohohoho. are we blardy stupid or what!? rhetorical question, but thats besides the pt. hehe. for full details, contact me for the video=)  last nite we stacked up all the trophies. so we had a tower consisting of about 8 trophies? including 2 big team trophies. cool or wad? again contact me for the pics. hehehehe.   shall post again some time later or tml. my sis gonna use. doh.

      i noe u guys might not be reading this, but in case u do(lyk jingheng), then "juz try ur best 2dae". but lemme juz round up wad we feel. (correct me if i'm wrong) we are not too bad. hopeful. sji's leotard's nice. (but dat's besides the pt). they are high but they dun look gd in their moves. chs is not bad. some high and highly unstable, others are too tall. others are simply quite alright. they stand a chance. so, in concluding, may the best team win.   ***************************************************************** countdown: 5 more hrs to comp

      common tests r finally over but i wont bother every1 here with a personal account on why i did badly for every single one of them. coz this is a team blog n i guess thats what i shld write abt- if i everh ave time i'll post on my old blog.  well basically in a few hrs time ( 1hr exactly) we're going to board e bus for shichangdi...n then we'll have 30-1 hr give or take..n thats all e tramp we're going to get for tommorow. 36 hours frm now my career as an ritramper/gymnast is goign to be over. i dont think i feel nervous i dont want to feel nervous. i dont need to feel nervous because i know we can go into the competition n we have already won. i dont mean winning that golden slab of metal though i admit thats a nice bonus. what im saying is i can look back on the past year and i know we have done our best, both in the singular and in a team context. e result dsnt matter. it kinda took be 4 years to finally realise that properly but i guess better late then never.  maybe the stuff im typing here is sounding cliche. maybe u've heard this b4 and wondering why ur even bothering to read this. but well cliche stuff become cliche because people without sufficient lexicon fall back on them to try and explain how they feel, translating the intangible into something substantial. maybe im doing that too.  i realise that im jabbering here so i guess i shld stop. i dont need to use words to persuade people what i mean.  thats all.   on a side note maybe someone will give n update on what new stupid stuff we've done this week. i for one folded a paper plane n threw it out of the window- where it hit the tree directly outside. someone wants to use so i'll just end off here.

      and so passes 1 week of boarding... our stupidity still never ceases to amaze me:p lets see. most memorable would be tuesday night.   what happened on tuesday night  1. power trip. enuff said  2. i changed avelines number on jinghengs fone to mine, then i started smsing him. that thick guy didnt knoe... HAHhahaha. i started by asking him when tramp comp was then progressed to asking him what the thought of me. finally i capped it all of by saying ive been very fond of him all this years. u shud see his reaction man! damn Blardy farnee. "...innuh!!!! jenhan what do i do now?!" LOL! and he thought i was being nice the whole time, since i was just sitting there stoning and laughing. little did he know i was the master mind=)  3. regurgitating toilet   apparently its sort of my fault since i dumped loads of tissue in when i was wiping up the mess my ribena made, but that was at 2pm! then boon shing went in to crap at 10, guess what? he flushed once, and not all of it went down. then he flushed again, the water started rising. so he though wth, and flushed again. this time the bloody thing flooded and splattered crap all over the floor. sick. so we made a video of it. OPERATION ASSHOLE! haha. please ask me if u want the video. video quality isnt too good because it was damn dark. by the, dusnt regurgitating toilets remind u of harry potter?   More stupid stuff... so what other things did we do? well basically i myself had 2 blardy stupid videos. daojies got a few. im too lazy to publish what we did on those videos but u can ask for the videos. last night we carried on the tradition. bed fights! consists of a 2 minuted match, in which 2 pple fight on a bed, trying to wedge each other. a win is 3 pts and a draw is 1 and a lost is 0.   so basically after one night it goes like this.  1. jingheng and i - 7 pts 2. daojie - 3 pts 3. boonshing - 0 pts  booonshing u suck!!! haha daojie wedged him in 8 secs!!! and i wedged him in the last second of the game. bloody jingheng is violent. grabbed me and started banging me on the bed partition. but i still held out. Muahahhaa.  commontests commontests have been rather fubared. amath was crap. left 10 marks + blank. not enuff time sia. then ss was a bit guailan, hopefully i din screw up too bad. bio was harder than usual, but still ok and geog was guailan, but shud be quite ok.   training.  trained 5 times this week. unbelievable. i think we trained more than some of the artistic pple. training as usual = training. so nothing interesting here.  ah. one week worth of events. lol

      there was once an active blog wif a spastic song called bob the builder. now: it is a dead blog wif a spastic song called bob the builder. ok lame comments aside. u knw i went gym today( because i didnt get tution frm miss peh, n i didnt train) n i realised, just hw stunted the development for a tramper is, esp in ri, esp since being a tramper mainly involves training 1 whole yr for maybe a 15-20 second long routine, and doing the same thing for veryveryvery long. tt's hardly the way to move forward isnt it??just think, can u tell ppl ur cca is gymnastics, or do u have to tell them is gymnastics trampoline? dont u think its a crime to leave without at least knwing something basic, no matter hw basic, abt the other 6 apparatus arnd u? ( im guilty of this crime but nvm abt tt). i mean theres more to gym than just tramp rite.....n wld it actually hurt to try something new? ( ok dont answer this because i think its rhetorical). u see right....im alredi retired frm c div n b div tramp. so i come back and just fool arnd on the bars(which is more than what most of u can do so there)and my main comment is laughter! ok so it sucks....so laugh...but at least i did sth right? ( laugh summore)  c'mon maybe u realise tt gym isnt just 1 thing; its a sports which encompasses so many different things, brought together by the main heartstrings of beauty and inner strength. n tt's y gym development isnt being good enough in a compulsury to get a medal back; its abt reaching as far as u can go anywhere in each n every discipline. hmm i shld be going off nw. think abt it b4 u start laughing again, n ask me didnt i say just nw 'lame comments aside'. (if u really dont wanna listen to this or think its utter garbage, u cld at least treat it as a first update in....a week?)lol.

      another week passes, yet another week closer to prelims. 3 more weeks only! naeooooo and im not even half way through. y cant we get study leave for prelims like next week??! lessons nowadays are as interesting as watching cement dry and it is just revision revision revision, hardly anything u wud call fun.  watch the village yesterday. the plot was interesting and quite good. although justin cheng and i were hum-ing away. for 1/2 the movie, my hand was covering my eyes and justing was burrying his head in my side. lol. not that it was a very scary movie, but i just can take horror=P. i need to watch a horror movie every year to remind myself why i dun waste $7.50 on horror movies.  like lim jee nee says "why pay 8 dollars to scare ureself?"  just had the national day celebrations. this year's was quite interesting. all the sec 4 geppers were stoning at the back of the hall and making guai lan comments at the performers (ie. imran) like "GOOO HOME LA", boos and lots of screams.  went macs with yabbie and paul and there was this bunch of ITE girls next to us. we were like chatting after we ate our stuff, and they were going "wahhh so ungentlemanly...", "think they talk ang moh very good ah?". i think they said these stuff coz they had needed more seats and we werent budging. still. bloody bitches man. u cudve just asked instead of trying to insult us. oh and paul was saying issit our fault that they cant speak english. spazzos man those girls. reminds me of some incident a few months back... after training, jingheng, andy, someone else and i were at S11 having dinner. then this bunch of KCP shits walked pass us and said "raffles suxxx!" bunch of losers la.  so now im home and im damn tired. after school, the movie, SS evening lesson and a lack of sleep, im seriously exhausted. shall go and take a nap then mug. must make up for yesterday's lost mugging time.
