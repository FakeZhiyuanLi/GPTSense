      Didn't actually feel like creating a blog even though Faz has shown his to me on countless occassions. But after reading   "Write It Down and Make It Happen"  , I reckoned that it might be a good idea to jot down ideas and stuff. Oh well, we'll see how long this lasts. Gonna go for a run soon.

      The run this evening was really good. But it also points to how much damage these last 2 months have done. Am so bloody unfit! Oh well never too late to start I suppose.  These last few days haven't been really productive and it makes me wonder if I'm going in the right direction at all. Am I really someone who is capable of leading others? Deep down something does not allow me to believe that I cannot be that person. And yet something else seems to affect that very belief. Who am I? Is it my destiny to be someone of such great value? And yes I know that destiny is carved out by our own efforts. But is it really who I was always meant to be?  Money is really tight now. No, correction; I am in debt. My bills are chalking up, I owe some people money and as of now, I really have no clue as to how I'm going to pay this off.  I think my greatest fear in building my other side is that I'll have to build up that group to a strength greater than that which Faz's group currently posseses. And that's a scary thought. If I can't build up Faz's group to such an extent how can I expect to build something greater? Also if I concentrate so much on this new group, how can I ensure that Faz's group doesn't fade into oblivion? As it is, I'm not even sure if Jason, Imran and Zhafri can complete their quotas for StarBiz. And with Wei Ming leaving the group to go to the U.S. everything suddenly looks to be in real danger.  Oh and did I mention that I haven't been in top form this last week? Jarrod was a big help. He's been challenging me constantly and I appreciate it so much. But how long must I rely on other people to challenge me? Why can't I challenge myself to be a person of excellence? I am an excellent person! I know it! I was always meant to be a person who could influence others. I am that person! I am a highly successful business owner. My influence does not stem from the material possessions that I own, but from the power of my character. I am a person who makes other people laugh, cry, believe, review, CHANGE! I inspire! My friends look at me and wonder what it is about me that they're not understanding. And for some reason, they seem compelled to ask me about Networking and what it can do for them. And very soon they'll all want very badly to join me. Again not because of the material possesions but because of the dynamic changes it has on my life.  My biggest disappointments currently lie with 2 of my friends in particular: Kevin and Paul. I dread to think about what they are going to do with their lives. Why do people not give themselves a chance? Did they really try? No they hadn't even begun to! For that matter, have I really tried? I sincerely doubt so.  I am never going to give up!!! I am not a quitter. I am a person of greatness! I am the guy people watch on tv and say to themselves, "I wish I was him!" And I will open their eyes to the road that runs parallel to them. A road that looks scary from their travelator of life. A road less controlled by any system, slightly more difficult to get used to but ultimately greater in the amount of freedom, passion, time and fun it can bring to their lives! This I believe with all my heart and soul! I am Marc Nicholas Nerva! And I am a fantastic person!  So what is my next step? What do I need to do to fully realise this person? How can I ensure that Dad retires by 2006? How can I make the dreams I have written for myself a reality? What do I have to do? Will I be afraid when I find out? Or do I already have the answers? I believe that my first priority for the week is still to help Faz, Jason, Imran and Zhaf hit their StarBiz quotas. I also have to ensure that Renee closes at least 3 more accounts. For myself, I need to talk to Aunty Dot, Adrian and Wesley seriously about what I'm doing. I am going to close 3 more accounts this month! I shall also have a good talk with Paul. I cannot leave this whole episode hanging in the balance. I am getting Aunty Gen to start properly and she is excited by it all. She thanks me for saving her from what could have most probably ended in disaster.  But for now, I need to sleep.  One Command; One Action One Mission; One Objective This is Life; This is the Journey Courage! Odyssey
