      Oh what a dangerous game I play. I am fucking exhausted/wired/suspended in indecisiveness right now. I'm like a damn meth head, pothead, fucked up thing is I can't even score any drugs. Celexa, Robitussin, Asprin, and Lettuce Opium isn't doing it for me. I think I am one of those people who might be better off on morphine and marijuana all the time. I know no one reads this yet , but If anyone does, send me hardcore drugs, I will pay for them.

      I am a degenerate gambler, I put $500 on  urlLink www.playersonly.com  tonight to get their deposit bonus and play some blackjack and poker, well with the $50 bonus and my keen gaming skill I am up to $700 now. Great, $700 to bet on sports, play poker, video blackjack, progressives, any time I want just a click away. I need to protect profit but scared money never wins, blah blah , blah. This after spending $600 to get a $120 bonus from  urlLink www.pokerstars.com  last week. Pokerstars fucked me, don't go there. I have no life and no other hobbies other than theoretical physics (I didn't even go to college) so this is why I end up gambling again. Einstein insisted God doesn't play dice with the universe, but Hawking says all indications are if God exists, He's quite a gambler. Probability waves are what you use on a quantum level; nature, the house, have the odds in their favor, I'd love for just once in my life to be like nature and have a 99.999999999% edge rather than the usual 52-85% edge you can eke out if you are an intelligent gambler.  Random killer pick up line (preferably in chat as opposed to in a bar if personal safety is of importance to you) : "I wanna fist you so hard you can't walk for a week you dirty little whore you"

      For those of you not in the know, the Universe is expanding. Not only is it expanding, it's been shown that the rate of expansion is increasing. Why? My theory is that our Universe is a 4 dimensional space-time brane located on the surface of a higher dimensional "bubble". A little girl is blowing the bubble from chewing gum in her mouth. 1 second of "her" time = 4.5 billion years of time in our Universe. The bubble will pop in a few seconds and our Universe will cease to exist. I call this theory Maxwell's Inflationary Hubba Bubba Theory. Feel free to nominate me for a Nobel Prize at your convenience.

      I am hopped up on something now.  So, she comes over, she looked like the pic , just a little more strung out and with no makeup. Next day score her extacy, I didn't do drugs at the time so didn't do any, she snorts x in my car, we go home and fuck I cum on her face cuz I didn't have a condom, I get condoms she suggests ultra thin, we hang out, she looks like a kid, says she's 18, we fuck next day again, condom breaks, I didn't know, I cum in her, It was good, she's a screamer, later that night, find out she has a porn website, and was a call girl, go bowling, see Monster at Suncoast, couple days later tell her she has to go, will drop her off at this porn shoot in Vegas, she says her mom just died, she is hysterical, she freaks out, what can I do, I need to lose this whore, I am driving her to the shoot, she is quiet, then she screams , she tries to jump out of car and kill herself, I have a mess on my hands, luckily she didn't cuz I have child safetly locks, I drop her on some side street wandering incoherently, never saw someone breakdown like this, oh well , this is fucked up, least I lost her, she don't have my name or #, guess I have a little conscience cuz I felt a little guilty , saw her online a week later begging for a ride or something , felt better cuz at least she didn't die.

      .com was her site. So I am living in Vegas, Henderson to be exact, and I have this fat whore cunt of a roommate who I can't stand (another story, If I feel she is even worth it) , and I was irritated, bored, depressed , whatever it was the usual, so I sit watching my bigscreen TV, with typical TV watching accessories, a bottle of Vodka and laptop with wireless internet. 100 years ago people sat around and watched trees, looked at the stars or told stories for entertainment, now it's not enough for me to sit and watch my 51'" HDTV with cable hookup and 400 channels, I am such a product of our ADD, action junkie society that I need the damn laptop with internet and liquor at the same time.  So your favorite degenerate ends up in the local chatroom only to stumble upon some little blonde raverpixie something was her screename. As a long time internet pro, getting up on a whim and going to meet someone in person from online I just started chatting with , isn't as radical for me as it is for most. Especially when I am buzzed and this someone is 19, blonde, skinny, vulnerable, from out of town with no money, and waiting for me at 12:30 am across from UNLV in this "LAN Party" establishment. Still even for me this is a bit brazen. My least concern is that she is really a fat slob as opposed to the skinny blonde in her profile pic, but what if she is a pyscho, druggie, porn star, or an aids infested whore? I  It's 11 am where I am now and I will have to continue this story later so I can go back to sleep and be fresh for gambling tonite.

      Did nice post then got cut off due to wireless laptop issues summary was this:  1) absolutely quit Poker and gambling  2) Fell through the attic floor last Friday night helping my mom move boxes, sustained minor injuries, however the living room ceiling has a 3' x 1' hole in it now, bad timing since house is up for sale and people were supposed to come look starting Saturday.  3) Everything I touch turns to gold.........

      You  yawn  and pull 3 muscles, one in your neck , one in your shoulder, and one in your chest. This after an exhilarating day of sleeping, yelling at relatives, and  watching  an internet poker tournament for about 4 hours,  watching,  not playing in. In related poker and gambling news I cashed out of Pokerstars, and now have no more money in online gaming accounts. I am going to really try and not play cards or gamble for at least a couple weeks. So let's take an inventory now, I have about $1000 in assets, $30,000 in liabilities, no job, no prospects, an antisocial personality disorder with depression, no health insurance, live in an area I hate with my nagging relatives, have about 5 "friends", and haven't gotten laid in over 6 months. In addition I haven't gone to a gym in over 3 or so months, and have put on at least 20 pounds, all of which has gone straight to my now Tony Soprano looking belly.  In business news, I am pleased to announce that I am now accepting contributions to my "Revitalize the Max" fund. Anyone with a Paypal account (  urlLink www.paypal.com  ) can make a donation to me via Paypal. Tax Deductible and you will receive a photo image of your bloated 27 year old "child".

      had the 700 from yesterday up to a little over 1000 and hour ago, bad run of cards (rigged, those whores) and I cashed out just now with 606.96, now this is where relativity comes into it. Did I just lose $400 in an hour or did I just make $106 in 24 hours? O well I still feel like shit.
