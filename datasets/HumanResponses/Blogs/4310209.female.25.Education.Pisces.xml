      i just sent out a mass email to friends and family (thankfully not co-workers) with a link to a porn video.  i did not do this on purpose.  i went skydiving a week or two ago.  it was phenomenal.  but that needs to be another story in itself.  today we're talking about my solicitation of pornography.  when i went skydiving, i got the video and photographs for the additional fee.  it's really a great video, aside from the Creed that accompanies the second half of the little flick.  again, that could be an entirely separate blog; my hatred of Creed.  so, my brother is a computer genius (he'd deny this, but anyone smarter than me is immediately declared so by myself) and i'd asked him if there was a way for him to get my video online so that people could watch it.  it's an amusing 5 and a half minutes and it would give me more people to talk about my foolish behavior with.  so he uploaded it, compressed it, zig-zagged it or what-have-you, onto a website that he has.  he sent it to me via AIM and i was able to view it.  i sent it to a friend via AIM and he was able to download it, but had to postpone watching it for some reason...he was busy, evidently.  since i am impatient and eager, i sent out a mass email with this link.  my aunt kiki, my cousin mikey, ugh.  they all recieved a cute little message from their nutty relative about some fantastic sport she'd just fallen in love with.  i can imagine them each smirking in their own way, deciding to be a few minutes late to class or to that meeting or for submitting that paperwork just to see that goofy girl jump out of a "perfectly good airplane."  then, moaning.  penises.  breasts.  pubic hair.  oh my god.  how does one overcome such a cyber mishap?  i have no idea what happened to the link.  i'm going to kick my brother's ass.

      OK  now, this story took place about a week or two ago, but it's such a fantastic (literally, surreal) little ditty.  I'd been seeing this guy very casually. He's moving to California, so it was one of those relationships that was doomed from the start, but we went for it anyway, for some stupid reason. the result was this love/hate relationship that stemmed from us both being surprised and intrigued by our similar personalities and annoyed that the other would no longer be around in a month or so. we often drank together and this further encouraged our passionate behavior.   so there was a Modest Mouse concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom. my friend had bought 4 tickets, two for her and her boy, and the other two for me and whomever (preferably not the love/hate dude, as she'd suggested, but i didn't listen). my friend, her boy, and myself meet up with love/hate boy in the city. he puts his bag in our car and we stand in line for 25 minutes to get in, observing how fucking young and 80s-fashion influenced the crowd is. we wonder if we're the oldest people here, but then see a man with a heavily receeding hairline and decide we aren't. love/hate boy forgets that he has some kind of knife on him, so i hide it in my purse so that we can make it through the pat-down at the door. it's kind of a thrill to smuggle weapons.   we get inside and swiftly order drinks. three of us are drinking Red Bull and Vodka very heavily, and my girlfriend is drinking nothing. she wants to wait until we go out afterward because Bud draft is beneath her and Red Bull is gross. the two opening bands are atrocious, we decide. we watch one person in the crowd get ejected for throwing popcorn at the singer. we laugh, somewhat loudly, as we are drunk. i argue with a short couple behind me because apparently i'm swaying. she tells me to "have another drink." love/hate boy curses at them, and i feel good because he's supporting me, which is different. more Red Bull and vodka. I lose track of my drinks and my girlfriend tells me that i'm acting like i'm on speed. i tell her that i feel like i'm on speed. we laugh. i tell her i won't have any more Red Bull and Vodka, but i keep drinking them.  here is where it gets fuzzy. i instantly became drunk and my love/hate boy was taking too long to get our drinks. i'd given him a 50, and he comes back, 30 minutes later with two drinks and no change. he has no idea what happened to the money. i tell him he probably bought chicks some drinks. he gets annoyed.  transport to the bar...love/hate boy and I are arguing and i'm not sure what it's about. i reach for him and he grabs my arm and twists it. it hurts, and i deduce that since i'm drunk, it shouldn't hurt, so he must have really really hurt me. i begin to cry and storm out of the venue. my girlfriend and her boy follow me. there is no re-entry.  for some reason, i'd assumed love/hate boy would've followed. he didn't. he texts me "wait, what the fuck" i text back "come out." he doesn't respond. he's the only person i've ever texted on a regular basis and that makes me resent him.   i call him and hear a girl in the background. he says he's staying with her tonight; she's a lawyer and has a place in the city. i'm fucking furious. i start crying more heavily now and plead with security to let me in. they do; i must've looked pathetic. i find him talking to the girl at the bar and resist the urge to punch her. it's a good thing i didn't. love/hate boy and i exchange words loudly, then i follow him to the bathroom. i tell him he hurt me and that's why i left. he said, "fuck that, next thing i know, you'll tell me i raped you." i'm shocked at his behavior.  suddenly, we're no longer fighting. we walk up the stairs to watch MM, as they've just come on. i'd forgotten about my two friends waiting outside. they weren't allowed in because my girlfriend's boy is acting violent, screaming at security and random people on the street.  at the top of the bathroom stairs there is a big security guard. he grabs love/hate boy by the arm and says, "you have to leave." love/hate boy complies, "ok." we leave the venue, not having heard more than 5 seconds of the headliner. love/hate boy instantly calls female friends and begins proposing marriage. i try calling some male friends to make him jealous, but none answer the phone. i am crying again.  we walk to my friend's car and get in, apologizing. her boy is still acting violent, but i'm oblivious. she decides it's best that we just go home. we all agree or just don't care. love/hate boy is now all over me in the back seat of my friend's car.the next day, the two boys claim they must have been slipped something. i don't believe them.  i realize that i am stuck on thrilling events, regardless of how they happen.  it was a bad evening, but i can laugh at it.  i still talk to love/hate boy and let him manipulate me into thinking i'm also flawed.  i must be.  why else would i interact with this person?  i think of college when i'd hang out with dealers.  i knew i wasn't at the level they were, but i liked the thrill.  and it made me feel superior, i guess, despite my obvious addictions.   i'm not sure if i'm in control and tweaking the knobs to get rid of that annoying buzz or if i am in fact being spun.  admitting your weakness is only part of the process, but it's startling when you think you enjoy it.  2:43 PM - 0 Comments -  urlLink Add Comment  -  urlLink Edit  -  Remove

      so I went on a hike with my friend and two dogs. it started as a beautiful hike! a new trail, deep in the woods, great weather. the Shawangunk Ridges. stunted trees. critter holes. crevices. greatness.  then, my friend developed blisters and promptly began to whine and get cranky. the views were less pretty. civilization seemed dead on my heels. we had to turn around. they were "that bad."  my dog, Angie, is normally very energetic, spastic, even. she does this thing that I've dubbed "the jackrabbit" because she'll just get hyper and run in circles with her hind legs under her the whole time in some sort of jackrabbit-run fashion. this is important because when she slowed her pace during our descent, i noticed. she eventually stopped walking completely. i had to carry her much of the way, as my friend whimpered ahead, cursing at the other dog for cutting her off as he meandered down the trail.  my dog weighs 54 pounds. she licked my face when i carried her and i apologized like an awful mother. i'd catch up to my friend and she'd smirk, and i'd snap "it's not fucking funny, dude." much of the decent was covered in silence.this was a few days ago. my friend keeps showing me her blisters that she won't pop. they're big and gross on her heels. my dog had thrown out her back, according to Dr. Winters, and is now on muscle relaxers. I kind of want to take some myself. my upper body is vey sore. still. plus the vet visit cost $180.
