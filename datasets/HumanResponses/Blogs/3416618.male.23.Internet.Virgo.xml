      The Beatholes were effing awesome.  But that is the way it always is with them.  I finally got to hang out with Zach and Melanie and a few of their friends.  That was nice and quite refreshing.  I haven't been out in at least a month.  I mean just for fun that is, and it was fun that I had.  Well, there is a slim chance that a big move is in store for me soon.  I can only hope.  No, it's not one of those, "I really hate this town, it rings me down" things.  I just figure, why the hell not leave.  I have nothing tethering me here.  Anyway...more on that later.  Overall the night was quite fun and at some points knee-weakening.  All I can really say at the moment is, Support Live Music.  And  urlLink The Beatholes  of course. :)

      So...some friends of mine will be heading here to Columbia in a few hours all the way from Myrtle Beach, SC.  (Something like 3 to 3.5 hours away)...  These friends are all mebers of a band called  urlLink The Beatholes .  I met them by playing a show with them with my old band,  urlLink Love Apple .  Well, our bands hit it off together and we began to play a lot of shows together.  Eventually, for whatever reasons we let our old drummer, Scott, go.  We picked up  urlLink Garrett  from the recently disbanded The Beatholes.  Garrett played guitar for The Beatholes, but he is one of these guys that can play almost anything, and quite well.  So...after a few months with Love Apple, we broke up due to some scandal and growth.  The Beatholes recently reformed and sound effing better than ever.  They also seem to be cranking out new material like a McDonalds in China.  My point?  So the story goes...  The Beatholes Boxing Day Hot Lava monster Live tonight at  urlLink The New Brookland Tavern  Columbia, SC

      Sorry for the vulgarity, but that is all I got today.    • Got an email from the ceo of the company that said roughly, "there was a problem in the payroll system...nobody will be payed until next Wednesday.  Sorry."  I am sure the landlords will love that.  Ah shit.  Why am I bulleting?  Anyway...it was a shitty day.  And it is going to be a shitty weekend.  Everywhere is crap to plunder through.  If I can afford it, I am going to go to Charleston this weekend to harvest more freckles, and gaze at others.  Well, I am a ball of no good right now, so I will post when there is something that resembles coherency in my mind.  "where's my mind?"  Oh yeah...congratulations Ben (co-worker) on the job.  Oh yeah again...Happy Anniversary Mom and Gary:)  sorry for saying bad words.

      Listening to some  urlLink Ozma  here in the ole bedroom with George.  I lost myself in video games for a little while when I got home from work.  That was fun, and I surprisingly did alright considering I usually stink at video games.  Well, then again I am comparing myself to George who happens to be crazy good at games.    Work went fairly well today, though it did seem to drag on forever.  It always does.  I found out I am getting Memorial Day off.  Woo-hoo!  We never get days off.  I am pretty pumped about that.   urlLink The Beatholes  are gonna play and then I think I will head down to Charleston to see my family and spend some much needed time at the beach.  My skin is thirsty for some burning.  You may have noticed in the comments from my recent post that I am more than likely going to switch back to my old design.  I don't know that there is much to explain about it other than I like the other one better.  Maybe the solution to having an html version of it will just be something like black on white.  I don't know.  I guess I'll just wait it out and see.  Well, I gotta go and get some work done.

      So bouncing fell through.  I really needed the money, but something happened with some ill communication and what not and I ended up not doing it.  Oh well...  So I am feeling very inspired.  BUT.  I don't know for what purpose.  I am sure it is another sign of depression.  I feel like I am on the cusp of something great and completely unforeseen.  I get these feelings a lot actually.  They usually mean that I am about to hit rock bottom again.  At least there will be a change of scenery?  I have a whole plethora of scribbling and the like that I have been gathering for quite some time, but I am positive they won't make it here.  I know, I just told of a secret without telling it, and for that I am a reprobate.  Sue me.  You can have all 2 of my dollars, and all one of my senses.    You ever wonder what it is like to have only one sense?  Any will do.  Think about it briefly, and without second-guessing...convey it.  But, only to yourself.  You never want anyone else to know what defines your weakness.    You may have just thought to yourself, "wow Jebb, that was slick" or "Jesus, what kind of pretentious dribble was that?"  I choose the latter of the two, as the fact is you cannot imagine only having one sense.  You can try and try and try again, but you will only be imagining all of your senses at once.  One ubiquitous roar of all but candid thought.  Now think about how happy you are to have your senses, and that you aren't still sitting there trying to figure out what the fuck Jebb meant when he said all that banter about only having one, and that one thing about people and showing fears.  Maybe later I'll return, or maybe I'll fall asleep to things that aren't really happening.  Either way, it'll be no more exciting than it was today when I felt blood and heat rush through me upon choking down my yogurt over debating the source of the next fulcrum for my daily disputes over dreams and inadequacies.

      I woke up and cooked some breakfast for  urlLink George  and Lauren, then George and I went out to hit some practice balls at the driving range, and we had a good time with that so we played 9 holes at the range’s par 3 course.  Man…I suck.  I realized I haven’t played golf since high school.  So you can imagine the result of today’s game.  25 over par on a friggin par 3.  Well, it was fun at least and I hope to be doing that often.  We headed back by my old ghetto apartment, and then to Pep Boys to get him a new fuse for his car stereo.  Then it was to Manifest for the new  urlLink Piebald  CD.  We only got through three songs before we made it home, but so far it sounds interesting.  I’m looking forward to hearing the whole thing.    Tonight I am bouncing at  urlLink Banana Joe’s  in the Vista.  That should be a good time.  At least I hope it will be.  I don’t want to spend my Sunday night effing with little bastards that don’t get along.  I am looking forward to the extra money though.  That’s for sure.  I think if there is any trouble I’ll be all right.  I am mostly a pacifist, but I won’t be backing down from some a-hole.  Especially not with nine other bouncers getting my back.  In fact the only thing I am really dreading about it is that I have to work tomorrow and I don’t really know what happened to the weekend.    Make money, money…make money, money!   urlLink I Liek Milk   *NOTE* - For some reason, if you comment, it doesn't appear until the next time I publish, so if you don't see your comment right away, don't worry.

      I helped Ben from work at the  urlLink Pain in Life  photo shoot today.  It was pretty damned fun actually.  Pain in Life plays radio friendly hard rock.  Not really my thing, but it is one of those instances where they are friggin awesome at their style, and probably the best at it in Columbia.  Anyway, I came home and started marinating some chicken to cook on the grill this evening.  I then got sidetracked as usual with cleaning.  I cleaned the kitchen minus the stove, as I am about to cook my sides there.  I cleaned out the storage closet and moved all cleaning chemicals to it.  In the midst of that, I came accross some old Christmas cards and stuff to me and Melanie.  Well, it's a sad thing sometimes.  Sometime it just catches you off guard.  I mean I can deal with some of the shit that is posted by her or her boyfriend on the internet, but then I find a friggin Christmas card and it tears me up.  Oh well. That's the way it goes.  Bush comes to mind in those instances..."It's the little things that kill."  Sheesh...forgive me for that whole Bush thing.  hehe.  Anyway, the radio program is about to finally be ready for the transition to local and regional rock.  If you have any music you would like played to the listeners of Jebb Rock Radio, drop me an email and I will see what I can do about getting it into the playlist.    Tomorrow night I am going to be bouncing at Banana Joes in the Vista to pick up some extra cash so I can pay my rent for next month.  Wish me luck, as I have no insurance and a violent bloody fight could mean an untreated Jebb:)

      I am going to try this out for a while.  I have the old coffee cup flash blog ready to go back up at any moment if you or I decide that this isn't going to cut it, but I wanted to give this new  urlLink blogger.com  html version a go.  It may just prove easier to update this way.  We'll see...  Expect me to change my mind every 30 minutes or so, as well as for there to be constant changes while I figure out how I am going to post the old archives and images.  Alrighty, that'll do for now.  :)

      Yesterday, George and I headed down to Atlanta to meet up with Star of the California band, Ozma.  We got on the road around 2:30 and made really good time, so we had plenty of time to hang out before the show.  I got a call form my stepbrother.  We haven't talked for a years, and he had some really interesting things to say.  There was nothing bad...we just talked about some old forgotten times and apologized to each other about times that we had not been so brotherly to each other.  It was really good to hear from him in that way, and I hope that our family will continue to grow closer.  After Ozma, we went and got a bite to eat with Star.  She is one of the nicest people I have ever met. I had some wings that nearly killed me (I don't like em hot).  So after dinner we split and went to meet up with Geprge's friend.  We hung out with him for a while and then proceeded to try to find our way back to the interstate.  Atlanta has a problem with signage, so it took us about 30-45 minutes just to get to the interstate.  We got on the road and stopped for some gas, then got to booking.  Just in time for my wings to say hello...but not really.  They just decided to make my stomach cramp really bad without any kind of relief in sight.  I took a nap to try to relax my cramped stomach.  It worked okay, but I woke up much later than intended and felt bad about leaving George to drive home from Atlanta in the middle of the night without company.  We made it back and I got to bed at about 6 this morning.  Now I am packing to go to Charleston.  I am going to hang out with my stepdad today, and of course tomorrow for Father's Day.  Then I'll be staying over on Monday for an interview at a company on Kiawah Island, so wish me luck there.  I will now conclude this rambling and very boring post to get ready.  Out.

      Yesterday was gym day 5 and it went as planned so nothing to report there.  The same goes for today's gym trip.  I'm skipping the gym tomorrow to get some work done before I head to Atlanta with George to see Ozma and not Rooney.  I think we may leave or hang with Ozma during Rooney.  There is something about that band that I just don't like.  I know this is weird, coz they match genres with most of the other bands that I do like.  I just kinda get bored or something with Rooney...sorry guys.  I am heading out tonight for a little bit of dinner when I leave here.  Actually I don't think I will ever leave here.  I am working on this Flash piece for the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardons Services website that I am redesigning.  So the Flash thing is such that when you mouse over a county name or county on a map of South Carolina, the county is highlighted and the contact for the agent in that county appears.  I am about 75% done with it.  Thank God.  That one piece has taken up almost 10 hours so far.  I will be glad to have it off my desk, and then on to slicing and coding.  Woohoo!  Yeah, so it turns out that I am a nerd.  In somewhat optimistic news, I got a call back from one of the CHarleston area companies I applied to.  They said I was overqualified, but looks like I may still have a chance at the position anyway.  I hope.  It sounds like the perfect job that I have been looking for for quite some time.  Well, I guess that'll do it for now.  Peace.

      Yeah, well.  It doesn't really qualify as a gym day I suppose.  My PT couldn't make it and I needed a day to let my muscles rest.  I am probably going to go for a mile run tonight, but nothing too crazy.  Today has been one busy and tiring day.  I got to work this morning on time but late in my mind.  I am somewhat of a freak about needing a shower before I do stuff.  I woke up late and didn't have to time to grab one, so I came in dirty.  I was okay with that for the most part due to the fact that I started a new schedule today to accomodate my gym time and stuff.  I got here at 9:30.  I went to check my account and found out that I was in the negative.  I had budgetted correctly but my web host drafted my account with out prior notice, so obviously my transactions got effed up.  George lent me a few bucks to cover it so I wouldn't get into fees and stuff.  Anyway, I went to leave to go get a shower in the time I would have normally gone to the gym.  I got to the car, and I had a parking ticket.  Dammit.  Well, I went home and made lunch, took a shower, shaved off my beard:(, and headed to the bank to make the deposit George lent me.  Then I got back to the office and walke into one of the busiest days I have ever experienced here.  Man, I did three different flash projects in a few hours, HTML, Coldfusion, Fireworks, and I am sure I am missing something.  Oh yeah, I took a refresher on forms in conjunction with databases.  Woo...  Lot's o'crap.  You'd think with all that, they could give me a raise and a few more hours.  I am guilty of taking my time on some things, but here I rip through most of these projects, and still see no thank yous.  Well, except from Dave (immediate Supervisor).  Which is nice, but Dave is a supervisor/not-necessarily-one.  It has been quiet here without Ben around.  I am sure that some people here are happy about that.  Well, I am off to finish up the last of one of today's Flash projects, and then home to see if I can find something to cook.  Sorry to have been M.I.A. for a while to some of you, but I have got to get these things done.  You'll find a better Jebb on the other side.  Effing great.  Now it is pouring rain and storming and my umbrella is in the van two blocks away.  When does it quit?

      I am sure you are wondering when I am going to stop making the gym my title.  Well, soon enough.  I wanna make sure it becomes routie and not just another something or other for a short time.  Yeah, so I got there early around 11:30 and my PT was already there.  I had reserved my time slot yesterday, but the time before it was opened so we went ahead and stretched and got started.  It was the same as the past few days except it seems to get easier.  Afterwards we went for smoothies again.  This time around I got strawberry something.  It was good, but on my way back to my house it started to tip.  In the midst of my attempt to prevent a spill I actually pushed it down on the crner of my console causing it to puncture.  Strawberry smoothie everywhere.  That's the stuff dreams are made of.  I got it all cleaned up, took a shower, and headed here.  Yep, I am at work.  I am about to get going though.  I didn't have time to eat before work so I am starving.  I think there is some fish and a movie in order when I get home.  Then its back to the flyer and computer crap.  Don't take that the wrong way.  By computer crap I mean the problems I've been having.  Well, I guess that is all for today...or at least for now.  shoont.

      My parents came to town yesterday.  They had mentioned they may, but I wasn't sure they were going to come up.  Well, they did, and it was a nice visit.  We went down to the river front park.  I had not been there since I was a sophomore.  That place is really nice.  I should go there more often.  Maybe they'll come back up with more frequency.  Anyway...being that they came up, I cancelled my appointment with the gym and my PT.  So if you're reading, again I am sorry.  After my parents hit the road back home for Goose Creek I watched the end of Matrix Revolutions.  Ben, Rhett, Marlowe, and Lauren watched the whole trilogy yesterday.  Wow.  After Neo did his thing, I got into my work-out gear and headed to the gym to make up for the time I had missed earlier.  It was much easier than the first day, though I was sore.  I locked up a little last night and am still feeling the effects of that and smelling much like a medicine cabinet.  No pain, no gain.    After the workout, George, Lauren, and I grabbed a bite then watched Mystic River here in my room.  It was a great day.    I am about to head over to the gym now before work.  I am going to start a new work schedule to accomodate for all of this new stuff I am starting.  I am tired of wanting to do, and not doing.  I might not have a lot of money right now, but there is no reason I cannot be happier.  Less time on this computer, and more time on myself.  I like the sounds of that.  I will be back later with a report on today's festivities.    Garrett, if you are reading this, I am sorry we haven't been able to cross paths.  My computer seems to be running better so this time I should actually be able to send you something this evening after work sometime.  Good day.

      Woo.  I met my PT at the gym at 12:00 armed with my bottle of water and towel.  I was instructed to stretch and then we'd start.  First up was the eliptical trainer.  The plan was 15 minutes forward, then 15 minutes reverse, then 15 minutes forward.  A total of 45 minutes on the machine!  Well, I started then I started feeling my asthma creeping up on me, so I took a quick break to shake it off.  I got back on and restarted the program, so I ended up with about 10 minutes extra time on the eliptical trainer.  Then I went straight to the treadmill for my jog/cooldown.  She started to tell me to increase my pace but then she realized that we were at the same pace.  She is a small girl, so every two of her steps was one of mine.  After a mile and a half I was done, and we signed up to reserve the machines for the same time tomorrow.  We will be doing this routine everyday from here on out.  I will be adding other stuff in a few weekes to supplement the cardio, but for now the heart rate is what's most important.  Today's peak heart rate was a 10 on the holy-shit-scale with a whopping 171.  Yeah, that's high, but I need to give the old 4 barrel a jump start.  After the workout, we went and got some smoothies and she headed off to get ready for work.  I came home and mowed the front yard.  The back yard is hideous, and it will remain that way.  I may see her out tonight, depending on what all I get done here at the house.  I am working on another flyer for The Beatholes, so I need to meet my goals there before I can go out again.  Not to mention the broke factor.  However, going out doesn't necessarily mean spending money.  That is all.

      Yesterday was Ben's last day at the office.  He started there a little after I did last year, and has luckily found another job in Charleston.  The only bad thing for him is that his wife and kids will remain here in Columbia.  It'll be very quiet at Digital now.  Ben and I are known to some there as the bad boys.  We're good...we just like for people to laugh usually at the expense of our views on our jobs.  Nobody cares about all this so I'll just put it this way.  He will be missed and I will be gone from there as soon as I can be.  I interviewed the other day for another job here in town, and they said I could start.  I told them that I needed a few days to think about it.  I am also checking in to some jobs in Charleston still as well.    I am about to get ready for my first day with my "personal trainer".  heh.  Well, a friend of mine has agreed to act as one.  I've actually been happy with where my weight has been lately, but now I am ready to give myself the big push into something a little more lean.  She will be a big help and I am happy that she offered to be my gym partner.    *Nerd report:  I added a second hard drive to my old mac the other day, along with another stick of RAM.  At first my old G3 was smoking, and now it is starting to act like an a-hole.  I think it is the RAM.  I added a 256MB stick of used PC133.  The beige G3 will run it, but only at PC100.  Ben and I think the problem may be that the stick still has some PC stuff cached on it.  So I need to figure out how I am going to dump that.  The hard drive seems to be working pretty well though.  I can now finish my photo database, and Protools is running just fine.  Finally.  As they say in the Navy...That is all.

      ewwww....Jebb flakes.  Exactly.  My skin hasn't peeled this bad since this time in 1998.  At least I can sleep decently now.  Ben and I shot video Friday and Saturday for the Yorktown Association in Charleston.  We are making a program to go on their touch screen kiosks to inform visitors about the available tours on the Yorktown and the ships surrounding it.  It was very tiring work.  The first day we made a shot list on each of the ships, and planned for the shoot the next day.  As sequence would have it, we shot the next day.  It was rigorous.  We descended and climbed narrow stairs/ladders all day.  Anyway, that part is done and now we are beginning to edit.  I met him earlier today to start the capture.  12 gigs of footage!!!  woohoo...  That went well, and then I came home and made myself dinner.  It was big considering I hadn't eaten dinner from the night before, breakfast or lunch today.  I made a cheesy pasta with tuna dish accompanied by baked potatoes, and broccoli.  Had a nice tall and fresh glass of sweet tea, and cleaned up.  Now I am sitting here typing this.  I am about to update my resume and do some other things in preparation for tomorrow.  I am hoping to skip out of work early to accompany my mom to North Carolina to see my recovering brother and two nephews.  I think they have baseball games tomorrow night, which I would really love to see.  Dammit, I also need to send out some emails.  I have received some really kind words from a few friends lately that I have been slow to respond to.  I.AM.AN.ASS.  Well now that this post has absolutely no form, I think I will end it.           ended.

      i am here at the office peeling my face off, and miserable.  garrett is in bad shape as well with second degree burns.  geez...4 hours in the sun and i think this is the worst sunburn i've ever had.  what's carazy is i've stayed out in the sun from 6am to 9pm before with no sunscreen and not been burned this bad.  well, i just hope it gets better soon.  i am going to back to charleston tomorrow to shoot a video for the yorktown and its surrounding vessels.  this is great for me for the most part, as i really took a pay cut when i went to be with my mom while she was in the hospital.    last night i began work on my new portfolio to send to the job i am applying for today.  i realized that my old portfolio has been hanging out in the dark ages and i have a lot more work since then.  other than that there isn't much going on.  just broke, burned, and broke.

      The weekend was pretty decent.  I got to see one of my favorite bands as well as hang out with Garrett all weekend.  We went down to Charleston on Sunday afternoon.  We pulled into my parents house and chatted with them for a few minutes before it was revealed that my stepdad had bought a motorcyle.  We then headed to the garage to see the beauty which was quickly followed by riding and much jealousy.  I am looking forward to getting my own motorcycle in the coming year.  It'll save on gas as well as being something I've wanted for quite some time.  After biking, we headed up for some shooting of pool until the early moring.  We woke and headed to the beach where we lost track of time and became badly burned.  I am far redder than Garrett, but I think he feels much worse than I do.  Though I did get sick from it last night, and this morning I think I will make it.  I am fairly used to being burned, but this is the worst I have had it in many years.  Garrett just left to go back to Myrtle Beach, and I am going to get ready for bill errands and work.  See ya later.

      So I am pretty happy to see that Death Cab for Cutie finally has their own official website.&nbsp; I didn't even know about it because I stopped checking a few months ago.&nbsp; For a long time they only had a cloak to the Barsuk site.&nbsp; Now I have a decent resource for the goods on my favorite band.&nbsp; Yay.    urlLink http://www.deathcabforcutie.com

      Generally speaking, my day has gone well.&nbsp; I can only hope that it is a precursor for the night that will surely follow as time would have it.&nbsp; I recieved an email this morning from the author of a new book.&nbsp; It seems he wants to use one of my photographs for the cover.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; I find that very satisfying.&nbsp; I went to college and did not graduate, but so far have achieved many of the goals I once thought could only be achieved post-college.&nbsp; I've had my photos used all over the internet which is nice, but this excites me so much more for some reason.&nbsp; There are cliche's based on book covers.&nbsp; Holy crap.&nbsp; People will judge this man's book by its cover.&nbsp; People will get to touch my work.&nbsp; That's just nuts to me.&nbsp; Below is a low-res version of the shot.&nbsp;       As far as the nerd report goes, I have added an XML "atom" feed to the left of the screen for all of you that read blogs via syndication.&nbsp; (Jenne is happy now:) )  Crap I keep forgetting stuff that I am meaning to stay.&nbsp; I will have a thought and think, "hey, I'll blog that", and then I get on here and forget.&nbsp; ADD I suppose.&nbsp; I do know that it sucks George is working tonight.&nbsp; He won't be able to hang out for the cleaninng or dinner which is quite the crapiness.&nbsp; What else is the crapiness?&nbsp; The fact that I missed going to Matt and Cathy's beach house.&nbsp; Can you believe it?&nbsp; Two of my best friends have a beach house for two weeks and I of all people didn't get to go out there.&nbsp; I haven't been to the beach since Amy and I went, and that's been weeks.&nbsp; Maybe I will make it out there next weekend.  I've been trying to see if there is anything I can sell at the moment.&nbsp; I have bills overdue and I need to pay for the apartment deposits.&nbsp; I won't get my first paycheck from my new job until the 6th, so I am really strapped for cash.&nbsp; Gah!&nbsp; I have a vintage Steve Caballero skate board I could sell for a couple hundred, but I love that thing and would hate to see it go.&nbsp; I did think of selling one of my horns.&nbsp; I have three tromboes left over from high school.&nbsp; At least two of them hold too much sentimental value but one of them may be able to make it's way to the $50 bin.&nbsp; Well, whatever...I'll figure something out.&nbsp; I will be back when I remember all that other stuff.

      Holy moly!&nbsp; I wrote lyrics to two new songs yesterday and plan on throwing some music to them this weekend sometime.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted on that.&nbsp; Benji came over last night and helped me move my washer and some other things.&nbsp; That was nice.&nbsp; We went and got some food and looked at some cars as his van blew up over the weekend.&nbsp; Boy did I get tired fast.&nbsp; I got home and crashed with my boy Cecil  (Cecil is one of my cats to the new readers)  after a&nbsp;little bit of The Family Guy.&nbsp; I will be going to Columbia tonight for a little more clean up at 217 South.&nbsp; Then I will be heading right back to be at work tomorrow.&nbsp; It sucks because I feel like I am going up for a fun weekend or something, but I am just going to clean.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Things are going to be good once I finally get settled here.&nbsp; Crap!&nbsp; Tonight could be the last time I get to see Amy, which totally blows if it is.&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; The fear of the unknown has just settled into my empty stomach.&nbsp; Let me tell you, feeding your hunger with fear is no substitute for beans or the Lean Pocket I will be consuming for lunch today.&nbsp; Either way.&nbsp; I hope to see her and El tonight somewhere in the midst of clean-up.&nbsp;   mmmmm...Lean Pocket.

      I had planned a trip to Carowinds today to see George's favorite band, 311.&nbsp; I don't care a great deal for them but I really have a good time picking on George about liking them so much.&nbsp; I told him I'd go see them with him, but then I got my new job so it kind of put a stick in those plans.&nbsp; Today would have been a great day for Carowinds too.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Instead I will be unloading the van from this past weekend (vid and a few pics from that soon) and preparing it for the trip to Columbia tomorrow night to finish my part of the cleaning.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Lots of driving lately for me.&nbsp;   I've started writing again.&nbsp; I had taken a break for a while when all the fun started, but it's back to the grindstone I suppose.&nbsp; It feels good to write, and it will feel better soon to have an audience.&nbsp; The new apartment should be happening really soon.&nbsp; I just don't know if I can wait for payday.&nbsp; I am so broke from all this moving and adjusting to the new job and I still have two more weeks before I get payed.&nbsp; I am not sure how all this will affect me.&nbsp; I am supposed to record this weekend with The Ectomorphs and then I am&nbsp; also late on some bills, and I have to eat, and I have to get gas to get to work and Columbia...&nbsp; You know the drill.   Well, lunch is over, so I will be back sometime later either tonight or tomorrow.

      It's lunchtime.&nbsp; Monterrey's would be good, but I will have my Healthy Choice sweet and sour chicken instead of driving to Columbia for lunch.&nbsp; The past weekend really whooped me arse.&nbsp; Lots of moving and mowing and stuff.&nbsp; I still have some more to do so I will be heading back for a few hours probably on Wednesday.&nbsp; It has been requested that I change my current pic to something a little less circa November to something a little more circa now, so I guess I'll do that as soon as I find one I am satisfied with.&nbsp; Anyway...that's all I really have right now.&nbsp; My thoughts are somewhere caught in a sandstorm and I cannot coherently find the pieces and parts for context and syntax at the moment.&nbsp;

      Yeah I am still moving.&nbsp; This morning I helped George move and now I am helping Ben move.&nbsp; There will be even more of this tomorrow as well as cleaning and yard work.&nbsp; I'm tired, and though I am usually not a skeptic, I am wondering about todas horoscope.&nbsp; For the sake of rhyme I will say this:&nbsp; I am usually not a skeptic, but my disorder is quite septic.&nbsp; Ewwwww.

      Well, I felt the need to make a nerd report so grab your slide rule, pocket protecter, and all the gadgets that you just got in the mail from  urlLink thinkgeek.com .&nbsp; Today I fixed the archives link.&nbsp; now they point to the correct directory.&nbsp; However, these are only the archives from the time that I have been using Blogger.&nbsp; These do not include the archives from last year up to the point that I switched to Blogger.&nbsp; Early next week I plan to start making those available for all the noobs that come by and want a little bit of backstory.&nbsp; I am also working on the new template.&nbsp; I like these green dots and all but they are fairly inconsistent with my coffee cup design.&nbsp; So?&nbsp; Well believe it or not, it was a coffee cup and a few colors in a resturant that inspired me to start my blog in the first place, so my goal is to get back into that fundamental design.&nbsp; I also added my horoscope to the "about" line of the page.&nbsp; This may or may not update daily.&nbsp; I am thinking not due to formatting and republishing the blog to the server and what not.&nbsp; I will probably just add it as individual posts.&nbsp; It would at least make my updates daily, and then there would be more updates than usual and you would be pleased with me as a blogger/nerd/ass/loser. :-)&nbsp; Also, I am planning to add some pics.&nbsp; Depending on space and all, I may add all the ones from my old blog.&nbsp; That way I could have my "in-post" pics and a gallery of high res pics taken for stock/art/whatever.    In other news...   I had a good meeting that was to kind of outline the next part of my new job which involves a lengthy content migration.&nbsp; I've gotten to be used to and speedy with those.   I am feeling extra fat these days.&nbsp; Basically, when I found out I was going to move I had to stop going to the gym.&nbsp; You may remember that from a previous post, but if not then here is the story.&nbsp; I got hired to my current job and let my previous employer know.&nbsp; Because of this my hours were upped there.&nbsp; Thus I had no time to work full time, pack to move, and go to the gym with my PT at the times that she could meet.&nbsp; SInce then I have been on the run and you know what that means...eating out.&nbsp; I cannot wait to move to the new place now and get back to making lunches and working out.&nbsp;   Man.&nbsp; I know there was something else, but now I don't remember.   Here is a shot from the commute home.      Jebb - 1 :: Amy - 0

      So for the past several days I've been listening to iTunes radio at work since I have yet to put my mp3s on my computer.&nbsp; Anyway, I listen mostly to the channel called Indie Pop Rocks.&nbsp; This title is very misleading.&nbsp; One in every 50 songs is pop and one in every 1000 songs is rock.&nbsp; I have tried to be fair and give it all a listen, but holy geez.&nbsp; Ever wonder why bands like Rilo Kiley, Death Cab for Cutie, The Decemberists, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Postal Service get so much attention?&nbsp; I'll let you know why.&nbsp; They deserve every ounce of it when compared to this other stuff.&nbsp; Indie Pop Rocks will play every effing song off of that Modest Mouse CD except of course for the radio single.&nbsp; You know, the one that is actually poppy or the least bit rocking.&nbsp; After cringing through an hour of mushy oddities you will be very happy to hear them throw on a song from one of the good previously mentioned bands.&nbsp; The difference between Rilo Kiley and say...Tortoise is light years.&nbsp; So, today I am listening to CDs.&nbsp; The one I am listening to in particular today is a mix of songs by The Shins that  urlLink Jay  gave me.&nbsp; I had it for a while, then  urlLink Amy  asked me if I had any `Shins and I was thinking...&nbsp; Oh yeah, Jay gave me a `Shins CD.&nbsp; So we listened to it on our beach trip a couple of weeks ago, and now I can't stop listening.&nbsp; Sooooo good.&nbsp;   I may go to Columbia tonight instead of tomorrow, so I can be better prepared for the day of moving and what not.&nbsp; More on this later as I make decisions.

      Dear Jebb,  Here is your horoscope for Thursday, July 22:  Take one last, lingering glance backwards -- and then walk away. You need to put the past behind you, and think about what's really, really important to you now.

       Man oh man.&nbsp; I have a good bit of stuff I could talk about but here comes the trouble with blogging.&nbsp; There are some things I want to say, but know that if I do then maybe someone will get upset or something.&nbsp; I'm not refering to the past either.&nbsp; There has been so much stuff going on lately and my mind is whirling with information.&nbsp; Unfortunatly it seems that this is best kept to myself.&nbsp; In other news.&nbsp; I went out with my siblings last night and had some dinner and drinks.&nbsp; My sister's friend Lucille came out.&nbsp; SHe was lots of fun and ended up paying for the tab at Vickery's.&nbsp; A very sweet gesture but highly unnecessary.&nbsp; So I owe her for a few.&nbsp; The night was fun, and I was happy to see the cats when I got home as they were feeling like showing a little reciprocity as well.&nbsp; Tonight may be 10 cents wings at The VIllage Tavern, but I am guessing not.&nbsp; I have stuff I want/need to get done at the house and I am very broke until my pay cycle gets back to normal after this move.&nbsp; Woo...gotta photo meeting , and a Mountain Dew waiting for me today...  BETH!!! If you are feasting your eyes on this dribble; I am sorry I didn't call last night.&nbsp; I was out really late with my siblings.&nbsp; I'll try to catch you tonight.  AMY!!!

       Getting started on day 3 now.&nbsp; So far the job is good.&nbsp; Unfortunatly it's been a slow start.&nbsp; I am doing alot of reading over our website, and seeing how files are organized, etc...&nbsp; You know, getting aquainted.&nbsp; I do miss Columbia, but really miss my friends there.&nbsp; When I get off of work I get some dinner and go straight home to hang with the cats and go to sleep.&nbsp; It'll get better within te next week or so when I really start to get settled in.&nbsp; I did get a nice call last night from El and Amy, but it just made me miss Columbia more.&nbsp; I will be up there this weekend helping my homies move and to clean the house.&nbsp; Then it'll be back to the apartment hunt.&nbsp; I believe it'll be West Ashley for me when I do move in.&nbsp; The commute is otherwise unbearable.&nbsp; I'll try to update tonight if I get back from my night out with my siblings in time to set up my computer at home.&nbsp; Work is starting now, so I will talk to you later.  Congratulations  urlLink Kenny  and Jill!&nbsp; You guys deserve the best.

      Tonight/today gave me my first glimpse of what my move will bring.  With the exception of a few phone conversations and a short ride to the U-Haul rental center, I have been by/to myself all day.  I spent the entire day packing and otherwise preparing for my move that will take place tomorrow.  All day I had tonight in mind.  Tonight – my last night in Columbia.  I was to spend the first part dining at Outback with Amy.  Outback was no desert so we went to Sticky Fingers instead.  It was good though it lacks competitive variety.  Now I am back at the house.  After this I will do a little more packing then possibly go out one last time.  I am really not sure though.  I am blown away by the result of not conversing all day.  I looked forward to this evening like it was Christmas.  Who wouldn’t want to go out and laugh while eating?  Holy crap it’s one of my favorite past times.  Well now I am completely befuddled.  As a result of my day I am Jebb Graff’s anti-personality.  I wouldn’t even qualify as my doppelganger after today.  My mind’s only challenges today have been choosing whether or not to pack the software with the back-ups and the blank CDs, or if I should leave my computer hooked up until the morning.  There has been no conversation, just wondering if I can make it a whole night without my nerd magnet.  You know when you stare off and someone says, “what are you thinking about?”  Usually you reply, “nothing”.  Maybe you mean it, but usually you just think that whatever you were actually thinking about was too trivial to repeat to your company.  You have company, surely you have something better to say or think about than whatever the mundane thought you had prior was.  Other than the computer thoughts…I really cannot think of anything I thought about today.  I just sat tonight and listened to Amy’s stories, which are always abundant and funny, and had nothing to contribute.  I am wondering if this is to be the case of the next few weeks, months, years even.  God I hope not.  I have never bored myself.  And tonight of all nights…  My last night with my friends…  My last night to be caught off guard… And all I had was something about sleeping in cars.  What really freaks me out about this is the fact that I recognize the weirdness.  I got the receipt for dinner and filled out the tip without thinking.  I left only a little over ten percent.  I didn’t know it as I was writing it.  I just wrote without a thought in the world.  Then at least 5 minutes later something started gnawing at me.  I couldn’t place it.  Then I realized that I was to be the waitress’s bad tipper of the evening.  I left some more cash so I feel better about it, but damn.  Where is my head?  Is this the best I’ve got tonight?  Hell no.  I am going to take a nap then go out and have fun.  I cannot prove myself an ass on my last night in town.  At least not for those reasons.  Goodbye Columbia.

      Today was slightly unproductive in comparison to the past few.  I woke up late and went to the front of the house, as I always do, to find the street lined with cars driven by girls that weren’t with me.  Two shrugs and I was showering.  I had a quick chat with Marlowe on the soon to be missed porch, and headed for the office.  I picked up Geniese and we had some lunch and a brief discussion about the state of our nation and the delinquency of mind it requires to put bumper stickers on one’s car that supposedly reflect something one feels passion for.  I dropped Geniese off at the building and came home to take care of a few things before running errands and going back to the office.  I failed miserably, as I fell asleep on the couch for a few hours.  After awakening and making my way out to the now empty street, I headed for the office to clean up the files on my computer, and pack up my personal effects at the office.  Goodbyes said... I headed to the court to pay my parking tickets.  I made it home in time to pack up a few more things and start a load of laundry.  I talked to Amy for a bit until she had to leave and I left to go meet up with  urlLink Justin  and  urlLink Leslie  for dinner at their place.  We had steak, potatoes, peas, and spice cake with caramel icing.  Boy was it tasty too.  Way to go with your culinary styling guys.  So I just got back and am about to shower again, and then my guess is that I will go out again tonight.  I guess it depends on whether or not my phone rings.  Wow! As I typed that, Amy called.  This must mean I am going out.  Well, I need to go shower now and make sure my jeans and tee shirt uniform is ready.  I’ll be back later with anything remotely interesting from the night.

      Just got home from Bar None.  I am trying to have as much fun before I leave as possible...in between packing of course.  I had a great time tonight with George, Lauren, Amy, El, and Rob.  However, I am an ass for a few reasons, but thats my theme.  So...[enter Dawson's Creek banter here...] and that's the story:-)

      Today was filled with more packing and a rat race for boxes.  I went to Greene's liquor store to get some boxes.  You know...liquor stores have good packing boxes cos they're all heavy and supportive of bottles in their day job, so they are definitely good for any heavy items one might be moving.  So I walk in jovial-like and request some boxes.  Much to my chagrin I was told they were all out.  The clerk directed me to a nearby CVS.  Supposedly a manager of sorts by the name of Anthony was going to hook me up with "repack" boxes.  These are those non-brand boxes that overflow and stuff is packed up in.  They are easily broken down and they have lids.  They are the crème de la crème of boxes.  SO I happily retrieve my carton of boxes and drive home.  The boxes are slung over the porch rail and then dragged into the living room where I find out that I have been fooled.  Anthony hooked me up, but with paper towel boxes.  These things don't have full bottoms or tops.  They leave a gaping hole on both sides when assembled.  Dammit!  So I get back into my jalopy and head for another liquor store where an old Asian man greets me outside.  He is apparently happy to have a customer (not such a good part of town).  I ask him the question of the day and he smilingly points and says "boxes over der".  I pack them into the van, but the man is seemingly disappointed not to have generated any capital off of my visit to his store, so I go back in and purchase a small bottle of Scotch for one last night on my porch.  I haven't done the porch in a while.  Yeah so I start packing like crazy.  A few hours later, I have completed the kitchen with the exception of the consumables, the dining room, and the attic.  I also had to uninstall a pool table lamp that was over the bar and replace the chandelier that was in the center of the room when I moved in a couple of years ago.  It was break time, so I had a few laughs with Amy about food and what not.  Ding ding.  I realize during this talk that I have not eaten all day, so I excuse my self and head for the ghost town kitchen for a PB&J.  Mmmmmm...Gone in no time, so I make another and allow it the pleasant company of a tall glass of milk.  Yeah.  It was the only meal of the day and may as well have been served by angels.  Man-o-man is that not one of the best combinations ever.  One time when I was in New York I went to a Peanut Butter sandwich specialty restaurant with high hopes.  Wouldn't you?  Well it was good except that they prided themselves on their homemade peanut butter.  That basically means unsweetened crushed peanuts.  Anyway, the sandwiches were good.  I got a nap and a shower and headed out.  Holy crap.  I'm an ass.  I am continuing this post from earlier, so I don't know where I was going with it.  Haha.  The end.

      I woke up lacking the gusto to run to the office and have nothing to do since my last project is finished (with the exception of a few changes here and there).  I called my supervisor whom understood thus giving me some more packing time.    I went in for a few minutes though and ended up being surprised by a nice lunch catered by Subway and set up by Stephanie.  It was a nice going away dealy until someone said, “oh you’re Jebb…well I miss you already.”  Haha.  I packed up a few things on the computer and am now back at home listening to music among packing, and starting to have pre-spells of homesickness.  Yeah, homesickness.  I’ve always considered home to be Goose Creek at my parent’s house.  Columbia has grown on me just enough to look forward to coming back and to miss it.  I know I am making the right choice to move to Charleston.  A purer life is there to greet me and help remind me of the things I am good at and truly enjoy.  I love my small but satisfying social life here in Columbia, but something is missing.  I never have anything to add to the conversation except for something inanely silly.  I never have the thing to say that tells someone what all I am into.  Thus I start to feel boring and my self-esteem/confidence/arrogance goes right down the drain again.  Destination depression; day in - day out.  (Alliteration always adds ambience…heh)  So, I am going to continue packing.  Tomorrow I will be the one that catches the eye.  I will smile without awaiting my curtain call.

      Well I was going to write a post, which I guess I just kind of did, but I am going to end it now and come back later for my actual post.  Sorry you had to read that.

      Just got in from the weekend on a squeeling tire.  Ben knows what I'm talking about.  Amy and I packed up and headed down to Charleston yesterday for a day at the beach and to move my first load.  We got to the beach in time for it to start storming, so we headed to the fishing pier to chat and wait it out.  After the skies cleared we went back down to my favorite Folly Beach surf spot, 10th street.  The surf was glassy and picking up with noone on the beach but a handfull of people and us.  Amy picked surfing back up quite well, and I surprisingly hadn't forgotten how.  We ended up staying out in the ocean till after dark before heading home for showers.  Then we went out to a seafood restaurant on Shem Creek in Mt. Pleasant and got some Calamari and burgers out on the deck.  It was quite tasty and odd as well, considering there were a few whole squid mixed into the batch of normal rings.  After dinner, I woke Amy up (haha) and we headed downtown, but we were both pretty tired form the day of surfing so we headed back to the ranch for sleep.  This morning we got up around 10 and did it all over again, except this time there was no storm except for everywhere else in the state.  We both got plenty of sun and stomach/rib rashes from the board.  After a jelly-fish sting or two, we got some McDonalds and headed back for Columbia.  God.  It's weekends like this that make you happy to be alive.  Friday was great conversation with Austen (Marlowe's sister), and the rest of the weekend was beach time with great company.  Of course, I am not happy with all aspects of my life at the moment, but when you are smiling to the extent that your laugh-lines are thigh-white and the rest of your face is sun burned...you can't help but be happy to be alive.  Amy, if you're reading this, thank you for coming down with me and thank you for making me smile.  I'm sorry I put you to sleep though, heh.  This week ought to be a doozy.  I'm not sure how work will be as I finally went live with the  urlLink site  I have been working on.  I do know though, that I have to pack like crazy everyday when I get home from work.  This kind of sucks because of the fact that I want to inhale as much of my friends as I can.  Some of them I am not sure if I will ever see again, so I am freaking out a little.  It's always scary to make drastic changes.  Hopefully distance won't halt frienships as much as it seems it will.  6 days left.  6 days.

      Wow, only a few weeks without writing here, and it seems like forever.  I didn't take the time to read where I last left you.  I’ll forgo the detail of every little thing I did since then.  I can say that I have been having a blast for the most part.  I have been hanging out a lot with George and all of my friends I met through him as well as with El and Amy.  Turns out that Amy lived in Bates West when I did, so it’s kind of odd that I didn’t meet her until years later.  Not to mention only a couple of weeks before I move.  BEFORE I MOVE!?!    You heard me right.  I am moving next weekend.  It seems that I have been hired at a company on Kiawah Island.  My last day at Digital Systems is the 15th.  I have been really busy finishing up a huge website there, and I think I am going to have to do another small one before I leave, so my hours were spiked to full time.  That’s good considering I will have deposits and stuff to pay at my new place.  These are bittersweet times.  I have finally settled into being alone, single, what have you, and am enjoying my newfound friends.  I am so excited to start my new job and beginnings in the Charleston area.  I won’t know what to do with myself once I’m there though.  Jay was mentioning to me one time the concept of setting a goal then reaching it, and not having anything to look forward to after it has been achieved.  I guess my next goal will find me soon enough.  I know that travel plans are in order for some random weekend trips to Chicago, New York, Lexington, Athens, Raleigh, Durham, and wherever else I might think up.  Here though…I close the door on what has been the most intriguing part of my life to date.  I have been in a major University, a semi-successful band, love, an unsuccessful relationship, a financial torrent due to those listed prior, depression, incapacitated happiness, etc…  Obviously there is more but God only knows what I might experience trying to conjure it all from memory.  I have experienced the best and worst occurrences my senses could handle here in Columbia.  The best part of it all, I think, is that I will still experience things that will consume my emotions like heroin.  I look forward to it.  I look forward to being in love again.  I look forward to riding motorcycles with my step-dad and brother.  I look forward to a cure for my nephew’s cystic fibrosis.  I look forward to putting the past to rest with my stepbrother.  I look forward to being able to sleep at night without remembering November.  I look forward to being able to sleep at night.  I look forward to forgetting what it feels like to hate.  I look forward to getting to know my dad and step mom.  I look forward to laughing for hours with Matt and Cathy.  I look forward to laughing for hours with myself.  I look forward to my parents smiling again like they used to.  I look forward to taking the chance on the girl that makes me smile.  Smiling…now that’s something I haven’t done for a while.  At least not in the sense that makes you feel like passing out, or screaming, or doing all at the same time.    People used to look up to me.  People thought I was going to graduate from college and become a great jazz performer or philanthropist.  People used to like the arrogance my trivial experiences brought me.  I can’t fathom what it would take to be like that again.  I am perfectly content to be in touch with the fact that I am not going to turn the world on a new axis.  The friends I have now will be those that bury me.  The friends that will smoke cigars upon the announcement of my first born, and who will toast to the death of the Internet.    God I can’t wait until tomorrow.    I am packing now for the move.  I am stuffing a box full of “souvenirs” from my last relationship.  I can’t see it quite like that.  A souvenir is junky.  It’s tacky.  It’s like laughing and then giving a high five to your frat-boy friend because you claim PBR as the best beer on the planet while across town a hipster tilts his PBR in a nod to the latest craze to hit the snob scene.  I’ve packed this box full of wedding planners, subway tickets, travel pictures, pamphlets, empty champagne bottles, tears, smiles, and fake wedding programs ironically printed on paper bearing the Love Apple logo watermark.  No, they aren’t souvenirs.  There was nothing tacky about that.  Those are the stuffed animals that you have your whole life and don’t even give to your kids.  Those are the things that are yours that no one else…not even with all of the latest information from the rumor mill, can lay claim to.  Those are the things that line your eyelids and seal your coffin.  Those are the things that you only wish could invoke the memory that made you keep it in the first place.  Those are the things that will be sealed into that coffin-like merchandise box and not opened again until my grandchildren inherit my debts.    Yes, it’s good to be back.  Now, I have some packing to do.

      Maybe you've noticed already but I changed my profile pic again. The last one looked like I lived inside of my blog with the colors and all. So today in a couple of hours I will be taking off from work to go and sign the lease for my new apartment. I am excited but bumbed because of all the fees you have to pay when you first move somewhere. I just got payed and am practically giving it all up right away. Oh well, at least I won't have the drive and I'll be in a kick-ass place with my friend.  My stomach is killing me right now. I think it has something to do with the Jalepeno burger I had last night. Man was that thing good.  Here comes todays big plug, so I hope you're ready.  urlLink 96 Wave FM (WAVF Charleston)  is the best radio station I have heard in a long time. I miss Columbia, but I don't miss Staind every two minutes. I had stopped listening to radio altogether in Columbia because of the oversaturation of NuMetal crapola. Now when I turn on the radio, I hear everything from Modest Mouse to Pavement to The Jayhawks to Nirvana to Staind:( to Elastica. I don't like everything they play, but dammit if there isn't a good chance that I will. I am not one of those anti-corporation, SUV hating, tiemyselftoananchortostopoiltransport kinds of folk, BUT...I am glad that 96 Wave has not fallen prey to the Clear Channel choke hold. Go 96 Wave go!   urlLink     (if you do go to their website, try not to look at it for too long as it will give you a seizure thanks to the friggin spinning thing on the left...STOP LOOKING AT IT BEFORE YOU SWALLOW YOUR TONGUE!!!)

      Looks like today will be one of those multi-post days.   urlLink     I wanted to tell you fans of the greatest conference in college sports about a new website launched by some friends of mine over at  urlLink Graysail . It is called  urlLink SEC Xplorer . It is a comprehensive site dedicated to keeping you well informed about events taking place conference wide as well as info about each city within the conference, making your travel to these cities all the easier. Go there and sign up, and also tell everyone you know about the site. Football season is upon us, and this site is here just in time for away games.

      I read this this morning and thought I'd share it.    Y  ou probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but there was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American. So an Australian dentist wrote the following to let everyone know what an American is, so they would know when they found one. (Good on ya, mate!!!!)  An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Canadian, Mexican, African Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan. An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, Seminole or one of the many other tribes known as native Americans.  An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan. The only difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them chooses. An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God.  An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God-given right of each person the pursuit of happiness.  An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other nation in the world in their time of need. When Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country! As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in Afghanistan.  Americans welcome the best, the best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least. The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America. Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 2001, earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures, and first languages including those that aided and abetted the terrorists.  So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did. So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the world! But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself. Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place. They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.

      Dear Jebb, Here is your horoscope for Friday, August 6:  You feel immediately drawn toward your new acquaintance, and the feeling is mutual. It's as if you've know each other forever. So what's the holdup? Get some coffee, and start talking.  haha.  I don't have a new aquaintance.  Ass.

      Oh man it's been a while. I think. I guess not in relation to the time I've taken to update before. So there is some exciting news for me and my old pal  urlLink Jay . We got our apartment. We'll be moving in on Tuesday the 10th of August. Woo! No more crazy-ass long commutes to work. Now it should only take me like 35 minutes. The new place is on the marsh in West Ashley right down the street from a friend of mine's house (by the way Layne, your house is awesome!). It has a big screened-in porch for my kitties =^.^= and 1226 sq. feet for my titties...wait. I meant for me and Jay. I'll post pics once we're in and all. My birthday is coming up in exactly one month from today. I think for my birthday I am going to buy myself a motorcycle. I am currently looking at the Honda Shadow Sabre.  see below...  It'll be fun to ride with Gary and the people I work with that ride. Gary has a Shadow ACE (American Classic Edition). These bikes are badass. Gary's is a 750 and if I get a Sabre it'll be an 1100. Anyway. I will obviously keep you updated on that one too.     I updated the  urlLink Love Apple  website for the latest preliminary "new" site. I should be getting on the real new one full force next week once I get settled into the new place. It'll have all kinds of mp3s, photos, and any other oddball fun stuff from the band. Of course there will be info on what everyone is up to and all that good stuff. I think it will be fun to make. I haven't done a fun site in a while. It'll also give me some good "get-back-into-it" practice before I get rolling again on the new  urlLink The Beatholes  website. I also have  urlLink The Ectomorphs  site out there but on the backburner while content is being gathered. Damn. I may have to hit Jenne up for some server space. This is partly due to the addition of some photography I am working on getting posted and some other "art" including prose and lyrics from my side-project you all know of as The Bad Hair Day...Ketchup and Mustard baby, it's good on everything. I will certainly let everyone know when the Love Apple site is up and going. I think everyone will enjoy hearing the band again. I listen to the CD at least once a month. It's pretty damn good. I know I am not supposed to say that because it's big headed and all, but it really is good. Alrighty...see ya soon.

      Pretzels are so good. Yesterday was a fairly exciting day for me. When I got off from work I headed over to the Citadel Mall for a little bit of wardrobe shopping. I've got plenty of clothes I suppose, but since most are in storage I decided to hit up the old  urlLink Gap . I've been going through withdrawal from my jeans (wear the khaki at work...which by the way is far better than wearing  urlLink Cocky  at work). However, I noticed over the weekend that I can't keep my jeans up anymore. Being me, I assumed that they were just old and stretched to the limit by my passion for eating. Well after a hesitant and hopeful grab at a size smaller at the Gap I found that I had actually dropped a pant size. Holy crap. I have been trying to reach this goal for years. In the past year I have gone from a 44 to an ohmygodholdyourbreath, size 38. That's right. I can finally go to the store with confidence that they will have my size in something fairly stylish. Now if I can lose the man-boobs I'll be feeling alright. I also saw an old friend of mine from high school at the mall. It's weird because she's always lived right down the street from my house in Goose Creek but we somehow never really hung out all that much. It was good to catch up with her a little. I went home and had some roast and potatoes and collards and beans and cranberrys and toasted pita with hummus and it was good:) After that and some good conversation with my stepdad, I headed over to Matt and Cathy's for coffee. I got sucked into a movie while I was there which I had not planned on because I go to bed pretty early these days. Monster is a chillingly disturbing movie and that's all I'll say about that. Aww dammit. ADD moment here. Well, hell. When I think of it, I'll post it.

      I am frustrated with classmates.com.  What an awesome concept.  I first got their spam when I was a freshman in college way back in 1998.  Actually I'm not positive about that so don't quote me.  Anyway...they are feature rich these days.  All kinds of options to supply your info to the world of your old classmates.  The problem is that you have to pay about 40 bucks to use the features.  I understand they need to make their money, but damn that's expensive.  I would probably consider paying for the service if it were closer to 10 bucks.  If I were to reach into my pocket and pay the 40, then I would face problem number two.  Everyone else that is on there isn't an official member, so all of those features I payed to use are inaccesible to people that want to contact me.  Boo classmates.com.  Boo.  Bees.  Boobies.  That is all.  Oh yeah.  If you are one of my old classmates, you owe me 20 duckets for having googled my name and found me.   urlLink PAY NOW!
