      wheee!!! i was so excited bout black eyed peas concert last tues!  hey mama!  they were damn good! haha really entertaining on stage n fergie could really shake her ass! but i'm a little disappointed with the crowd tho..they were like lack of enthusiasm man! haihz...i was like outta my seat with liz..dancing our hearts away n shaking our booties [haha!] n practically more than half of the other ppl in the indoor stadium jus sat on their cushioned seats!!! i mean  c'mon man!  this is a concert! u pay money to party! u dun jus come n stone in ur seats!!!  hello?!?!  so whenever i turned around behind me..i jus see ppl stoning in their seats staring at us dancing like  omigosh!  how can those two gals jus dance in public?...n u know in a concert..to have fun u gotta have that energetic atmosphere in da air..the one where ppl jump up n down n dance to the music? sing along with the group? n have tons of fun? yeah basically energy was missing in that concert n it was not because of black eyed peas being boring or watever..they r not! jus that the crowd were really  not  expressive at all [til the last song 'where is the love?' when everyone stood up n sang along!!!]   could tell that even black eyed peas were pissed n disappointed with the crowd...they were asking ppl to get outta their freaking seats n dance but obviously very lil ppl did! they even commented that thailand [where they were the day before] had more energy than s'pore! even the many many  angmohs  who made up half of the crowd jus sat in their seats!!! i mean i tot they were da wild n enthu ones!!! i guess not! there was one point in the concert where black eyed peas were trying to get the crowd to move by asking them to raise their hands n wave!!! haha..it's like so funny!!!! cus i mean they hafta teach us how to party!!!! oh they actually sweared on stage too.. mother fucking! dance!  yeah see..they were pissed!!!   haihz...i guess one factor was there were like primary school kids around with their parents!! haha i was really surprised n amused before the concert started to see kids! with their parents in their 40s!!! i was like  did they think this was disney on ice?  hahaha...could tell parents were shaking their heads..disapproving of fergie's suggestive n sexy dancing n the language black eyed peas used!!! but  wat the hell ...y on earth did they bring their kids ere? it's a freaking concert man!!! u gotta have a certain level of openness n maturity n exposure to enjoy man!!!  so i guess i could have enjoyed the concert more if the crowd was much much lively!!! hence...i dun dare waste my money on linkinpark's concert ere cus i guess the atmosphere n da crowd would be similiar...heh! on the other hand..incubus concert last year was freaking fun n full of energy...danced so much n sweated so much..hehe..burnt calories there!!! oh yeah n wateva the journalist in Life!-the straits times wrote about the concert a few days ago was not true! cus i was there n i tell u energy was not in the air among the crowd, contrary to those who performed on stage.

      i'm confused. wat makes me  think  i can actually cope with all this workload n  live   up to all these expectations?   i was here by "default" [i dunno if it's da right expression to use but i feel tt way].. i was given the word that i could leave this place n go home..but circumstances in the end didn't allow my wish to come true. so i feel as if i'm suffocating in this place..tryin to find  fresh  air n breathe  life  into my soul. can i eventually succeed n find niche for myself?  but then again, promises, more often than not, are always broken. so wat if i was given the word to escape this island? i might still be here watever happened. i'm so used to this cycle of ppl breaking promises made to me. WHY?

      i know i've done wrong many times in my life. i know i've hurt u in one way or another. i know it's my fault now but back then i didn't. i wanna apologise but i can't bring myself to it. it's not because of pride. i jus dun wanna bring up da past..it'z been such a long time...months or maybe years...if i do bring up this topic, it'll only hurt both parties n all these efforts of forgetting the past would be gone to waste! but i do feel guilty n when u r bitchy or ignoring me or basically jus being mean to me, i feel hurt n sad..but i know i started it...so it'z my fault n i dun blame u for the way u behave and act towards me.   jus wish i wasn't so selfish last time. jus wish things could ...jus wish..jus wishing.

      Hello there, the angel from my nightmare The shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley We can live like Jack and Sally if we want Where you can always find me We'll have Halloween on Christmas And in the night we'll wish this never ends We'll wish this never ends  (I miss you I miss you) (I miss you I miss you)  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This sick strange darkness  Comes creeping on so haunting every time And as I stared I counted  Webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their insides Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason Will you come home and stop this pain tonight Stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already  The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)

      u gotta admit it. we're not as close as we used to be. will our friendships last? ten years down the road, would we still giggle and laugh and gossip like our old school days? will we still share our secrets and laugh at ourselves? would we still be bitching around? do we still have a connection between us? wat lies ahead?  r we gonna be invited to each other's weddings? to our kids' weddings? tell me..how long will we remain friends? there are so many changes..we meet new ppl n we move on...some old friends are forgotten but some are kept and treasured forever...  [we find less things in common...we find we dun understand each other as well as last time...we miss each other but we can't help drifting apart in our busy schedules]

      It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  Can anyone tell what I've done  I miss the life  I miss the colors of the world  Can anyone tell where I am   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun again  Away from the sun again   I'm over this  I'm tired of living in the dark  Can anyone see me down here  The feeling's gone  There's nothing left to lift me up  Back into the world I know   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines to light the way for me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again

      i'm not used to life ere...i guess i should be adapted to s'pore after 2yrs living ere rite? but i guess my  heart  is not!!!! itz not that s'pore is bad..dun get me wrong! it's jus dat it's different u noe...   i have to take the bus ere. back home i am driven around.  ppl will stare at me if i danced with my earphones on in the bus n think i'm nuts. back home i can blast the music in the car n boogie down.  the moment i step into victoria hall's compound, i feel so stressed n confined. i felt completely care-free n happy last week.    i dun think i'll ever miss victoria hall in my life. vjc maybe but not vh.   today i jus couldn't sit myself down to study..decided to slack at my aunt's place instead...so i watched tv n talked to my aunt. it really felt good chatting to her..i mean she'll tell me stories about my mom, my uncles etc. and i always learn something new..like a lesson or something. gotta study hard..get a degree n get a good job..dun hafta strive so hard to earn money..tough life..   "wat do u wanna be when u grow up?"  i think i've been asked this question at least 5 times just this week alone. i dunno. i really have no idea. ppl sy u gotta know n have a direction in ur life. if not, u r just lost n u will be wandering around wasting ur life away. everyone has gotta have a goal, a dream, an ambition in life. i used to have one long long time ago. but i've lost sight of it. i can't seem to remember. i've  lost .

      i am quite stressed out by the mid year exams, really! i mean i'll be really worried n all but i jus can't seem to sit myself down n concentrate on my work..other words i'm unable to study. i've got no mood to mug! :(  so i'll  try  to "console" myself by convincing myself that it's ok to fail cus i've got nothing to lose and all that. which is true rite? i mean..whose expectations am i supposed to reach? only mine rite? so all i've to do is set lower expectations! thatz it rite? but i guess i'm afraid of the future..like wat'll happen if i lose this scholarship n all..do i work? or go to college in m'sia? then other factors will come in..obstacles etc. OR if i get horrid results for my alevels n can't get any scholarship [this situation is very very likely], would i get to go university? or will i have to get a job? *frowns* maybe i'm thinking too much..like way ahead..but ppl say u gotta plan for ur future rite?  honestly i dun mind working my ass off..haha! ok ok..working to survive..wats so bad about it? jus because i dun have any degree doesn't mean ppl won't employ u rite? true dat i won't get a high pay but u know.. work my ass off to get promoted!?!??! yeah but then yk was like "wth! no..better work hard now in sch than regret later n work in the outside world" which makes a ton of sense  but  i still dun see the point in torturing myself to do something i dun wanna do...n i really see no use in wat i learn at school!! n then kj had to remind me that wateva we learn we will not use in our future careers but we attend sch n learn all these stuff to keep our minds thinking n to develop our brains! haihz..well that made sense too!!!

      nowadays, when my uncles n aunts ask me "how r u?"...it's different from last time. i can see in their eyes n the tone of their voice that half of them wants me to say "ok" n the other half wants me to cry n say "no..life sux!" n open up to them!!! but i always say "ok lar" n i can sense the relief coming from them, afraid to face up to a  broken down  me..then they'll smile with the  sorry look  at me... wat am i supposed to do?  maybe i'm too sensitive..maybe it's me n not them...maybe..  c'mon! itz not like i'm not constantly reminded every day of my life...everywhere i go..in sch, in da mrt, in restaurants, in malls..practically everywhere..even in my room! although some ppl forget, i don't! even though some may not know, i dun wish to explain it. i'll divert when it comes up. i used to mention it quite willingly but now i'm tired...so  u can jus remain in the dark    wat am i most afraid of?   forgetting ur scent ..i can only vaguely remember ur perfume..very very vaguely..it has been years..i dread the day when i would completely forget it  losing the memory of ur face in my mind ...the good times..the awful times..everything about u..i wish i could recall every single day..every moment..i wish i could have captured it all in my mind...but i'm human n obviously cannot..

         Birth stone  Opal or aquamarine   You like...  Pretty ornaments, cuddly toys, romance and candles.   You dislike...  Loud computer games, wrestling, yesterday's fashions and being lonely.   You're best at...  Patching up problems between mates, always seeing both sides of the story and surrounding yourself with beautiful things and people.     Deep down... You yearn to find ur soul mate - the one man who will sweep u off ur feet and ride into the sunset on a big white horse. Love and relationships are what matter to u most.   Your career... In keeping with ur caring nature, choose veterinary science, teaching or medicine.   Fashion  You like clothes with a sexy, feminine feel. You love frills and flounces but won't wear them unless they're in fashion. You look good in a variety of colours from bright red and navy to softer, more pastelly shades. When it comes to accessories, you like jewellery but it has to be discreet and understated. No tiaras for you, thanks very much!    As a mate...  U will go to any lengths to avoid tiffs and hate it when a friendship breaks up. Ur mates find u interesting and objective but they get frustrated when u can't make up ur mind. Mostly, though, they think u are trustworthy and terrific.   As a girlfriend... U love being part of a couple and will work ur socks off to keep things calm 'n' cosy. Arguments bother u so u would rather avoid an issue than knuckle down and sort it out. U are happiest when everything's rosy and crumble into a tearful heap when it's not.   If your boyf's a Libra...  Expect him to be a good listener but give him space to say his piece too. Libra boys find it difficult to make tough decisions, so learn to read his mood and take the lead about where to go on dates, etc. He'll soon come round if u handle with care.

      Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  [Chorus] I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated, so motivated I am certain now that  [Chorus]  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current  So let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...

      yay just got back home, had my bath, shampooed twice etc.  love my used-to-be red hair, two glitter ex-butterflies on my hair, my henna flowers and my rather desolate looking nails!  i think the homecoming carnival was much more fun than expected! (: even though i think it was mostly hc ppl buying from other hc ppl's stalls. fun lah huh? also, my class' stall did REALLY well, as in the time i was there. maybe everyone flocked to the stall cuz I was doing the painting? -beams- everywhere i turned there was a glitter butterfly on someone's hair. SO CHIC K!!!!!  ok just for a recap, i'm annabelle (the spoily pink princess*), serene's trixie, et's candy love and nic's lulu. you're all under psuedos in my phone memory so everytime you call or msg it'll be a msg/call from CANDY LOVE or TRIXIE or LULU. (: i think i'll just die laughing on the spot!  ooh sorry et didn't show you mikail today. he's actually quite cute but has no fashion sense (think orange carnival tee and pale yellow board shorts), personality sucks and nic thinks he's gay. oh DEAR. :S  yupp today was fun but i'm absolutely shagged. i think i'm gonna get a sore throat from screaming too much in the haunted house. actually more like i'll get a stomach ache from laughing too much cuz the haunted house was REALLY funny. :D don't know how nic's gonna survive thru private parts without falling asleep. uploading photos right now so i'll post them soon.  NITE CHICAS! -lizziebabyy

HC sux man. so few pple dressed up. buncha boring buggers. haahha..nvm. at least we had our pink/red saris (yeah liz?) hahahh....and serene's SIA attire! cool stuff..   CT was totally xianed. ended up gossiping. haahahhah. jason was telling me about some horizontally challenged girl in a sari tt was 'talk of the town'.

      ok first and foremost: WHO'S THE GENIUS WHO PUT THE I EAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU THINGIE? it's damn damn cool. was going to do it myself but someone beat me to it! (:  i'm currently doing project work. unfortunately, i am the bloody group leader so i actually have to plan ahead of meetings what to discuss etc. I AM STRESSED. also, i have somehow ended up doing the minutes of meetings 4, 9 and 14. someone shoot me? i don't even remember turning up for meeting nine. guess i'll just have to fake it.   it was racial harmony day today! i wore a sari - guess what colour it was et! bet you'll make a lucky guess than scroll down to read serene's entry which tells you the colour. haha. in an amazing display of class sprit, only two people in my class dressed up today, ME INCLUDED. that's sad don't you think? haha nvm. had all the S63 and S75 ppl for company. (:   contact time today was pretty fun (: i wasn't freezing in the audi as&nbsp;i usually do cuz i had to beautiful pink sari to protect me from the cold and had a whole range of nail polish to paint my nails with. nail polish is for my carnival stall btw. highlight of nail painting was this&nbsp;classmate called taige who painted both his pinkys blue and white respectively. he was really really really proud of his handiwork, heck, he was waving his hands about for the whole world to see - i've got pictures! apparently his right pinky smelt of apple but his left pinky smelt of petroleum. and trust me, he's NOT gay, so i guess he's just weird?   danced for a while after that then went to meet cheryl t in orchard to go to ghim moh with. cheryl stays in ghim moh and my tuition's at ghim moh so yeah, had company&nbsp;(: had to walk home from ghim moh after tuition cuz it was too late to catch a bus :S aren't you guys PROUD that i walked home? i'm honestly amazed at myself!   hmmx i don't know about you but acjc seems like the most fun place to be! cheryl's having a blast and so are all the other ppl in acjc whom&nbsp; i know! grrr i'm one jealous chica. but i guess i'm resigned to my fate in this mud coloured uniform. i can hardly wait till i'm out of the bloody school. (excuse the language) hope uni is alot more fun!   yupp it's wed, two more days to the weekend! we can make it through school/cca/homework/evil project work/etc, I KNOW WE CAN!

      HEY i don't see anything wrong with the password. especially after today's madness :S we have to have justea fights more often, and more additions to our bimbo club. serene needs to get her ears pierced too so we can all wear butterfly earings on mondays ---> it's a rule remember! oh i asked et about her school bag. apparently she was carrying a red backpack in the beginning of the year. so all four of us carry red backpacks to school. is that creepy or WHAT? i insist that it's my influence that you all have converted to RED. red is the new pink ya? sc dance concert this fri, ac dance concert this sat. can't wait you guys!

      - felt lilke screaming!  yesterday was ndp celebrations! i actually had fun! singing all those propaganda-ish songs actually made me feel patriotic :D oh and i went on my first major class outing - feel proud of me! yupp we watched the village and turned out to be in the same theatre as nic! so coincidental right? hmmx also met et in tangs basement so we spontaneously decided to dinner together.  i was trying to track where my fifty bucks went yesterday. to my horror, i found that i spent half on food! ahhh! and it wasn't like on solid meals - one marche lunch, one mos dinner etc. it was like snacking on and off on icecream and tori-q (chicken skin!) and more icecream. fattening!  i had dance today. the only reason that's holding me back from killing my choreographer is that tiny snag that it's illegal to kill. darn k. she uses fuck, damn etc on a regular basis to vent her frustrations and has a limited vocab. our dancing can either be described as horrible, terrible or hideous. that's one case of seriously limited vocab. and it wasn't so bad initially cuz she picked on other ppl but this morning she was like   lisa point your DAMN toes!   and that's when i officially joined her hate club. :D  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

      hmmx i'm not very enthu abt kickboxing. i'm gonna be really busy with dance practises -apparently we've got to do three sets of dance classes concurrently now. one dance for syf next year, one for teachers' day and one for open house which is the week after promos. i'm so gonna die of exhaustion. oh and has it occured to anyone that promos are in two months?  -panicks-   haha i'm such a spoiler :D  whoops?   i think it's time serene shared more abt daryl, and  candice . there seems to be more than meets the eye. ;) i have no idea what daryl looks like even though serene insists that she's seen him the same number of times i have. so  i think serene should share more.   THIS IS A HINT, take it. :D       lizziebabyy

      saw this on sumone else's blog... juz tot of putting it on ours...  She wrote a beautiful list of the things that she has done in her life. And so much of it reminded me of the things that I have done in my life, and that I should be grateful for. For those of you who have never done any of the things on this list - I want to recommend that you take the time to do one or two today.  1. I've cried during movies that weren't sad 2. I've danced as though I was the only one on the floor 3. I've loved so much I cried 4. I've grieved and cried oceans of tears 5. I've tried to make art with words 6. I've taken risks that didn't work out 7. I've taken risks that did work out 8. I've struggled to grow 8. I've pondered my purpose 9. I've done things I've regretted 10. I've tried to live without regret 11. I've felt deprivation 12. I've felt so tired I cried 13. I've laughed and cried at the same time 14. I've dreamt of success 15. I've had to redefine what success means to me 16. I've trusted those who didn't deserve it 17. I've made very meaningful relationships 18. I've felt more gratitude than I can express 19. I've questioned my own abilities 20. I've felt pride 21. I've covered my eyes during scary movies 22. I've laughed at while teasing others 23. I've made smart-ass remarks 24. I've stayed safely on the fence to avoid conflict 25. I've succeeded at tasks and failed at tasks 26. I've had to tell others the truth, even when its hurtful 27. I've told others many things I appreciated about them 28. I've danced in the snow and tasted the snow 29. I've tried to ski 30. I've seen a planet through a telescope 31. I've had to let go 32. I've forgiven others 33. I've been forgiven 34. I've been hyponotized by music 35. I've become lost in beautiful surroundings
