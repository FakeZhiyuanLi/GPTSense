      That's how to say elephant in Korean.  If you are ever considering learning a language- take my word for it, the Rosetta Stone cd-roms are the very best.  I've tried so many other programs and they just pale in comparison.    Yikes, I gotta get ready for work in a few minutes.  Bye!

      Skin products I love to use (lately):  *Burt's Bees Apricot Baby Oil *Neutrogena's Sesame Bath Oil *Cinnabon Lip Balm *Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns (Its a shampoo, conditioner, AND body wash)--Great with Demeter Cinnamon Bun Pick Me up cologne and lotion and moisturizing oil *Philosophy's The Gingerbread Man Salt Scrub *Borghese Mud Mask *St. Ives Peach Facial Scrub *Neutrogena Soft Shimmer Lotion *Crabtree and Evelyn's Gardener's Hand Recovery and Hand Lotion *Lancome's skincare line  Okay, here's the dig on the cinnamon smelling stuff:  A perfume company ran a test on how people reacted to different scents.  The number one favorite scent overall was cinnamon buns....it was also the only scent that men found sexually arousing. Don't get me started on the Freudian implications, but hey, I'm not too proud to prey on men's sexual-olfactory proclivities, no matter how deviant they seem to me.  Luckily, I loooovvve the smell of cinnamon buns.     **I do actually wear grown up scents too: -Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs during the day -Addict by Christian Dior and Rouge by Hermes at night

      Oh... I'm just a grrrrl.  Gotta love Gwen for that piece of self-promotion.  Anyway, took my first golf lesson today.  I loved that I could get a female instructor.  She's built a lot like me (even has double jointed elbows!) and I had a fantastic time!  I am finding that I love how self-governing the game is... every swing is a lesson in control: mental, emotional, physical, and situational.  So many variables.  Sometimes I am so "business" out on the course that I forget how good it is to be outside, the be moving, to see so much green.    Besides just sheer respect for the game, the company I keep certainly makes the day, um, colorful.  Big Stupid (a pet name for a friend) keeps me laughing all day long.  He says the most outrageous things- for ex:  He talks about making a long dive south when things are especially--err-- messy for a girl.  What he calls an icebreaker is dippin his fingers in and smearing on war paint to let her know that he doesn't give a damn what time of the month it is.  He goes there.  Eeeewwwww! That's no ice breaker in my opinion- its more like an ice obliterator.  He may be foul, but he is never boring.  I saw the Struggler today.  Man, did she look rough!  Bags under the eyes, coked up, f*cked up, and strung out.  I know its her own fault, and I shouldn't waste time feeling sorry for someone with such wacked priorities, but I can't help it.  Seeing her like that was like icecream falling off your cone, seeing roadkill on the side of the road, and dropping your money in the toilet.    Sweets crashed out on the couch.  Even Spanky is snoring.  I guess I'm not ready to call it a day yet.  Guess that's why I started this thing.  I wonder if I'll ever be able to call it a day.

      I just got the recipe for the most amazing Filipino soup called Kare-Kare.&nbsp; Nikki made it for me in D.C. and it is scrrrrrrumptious.&nbsp;It is a creamy, nutty stew-like concoction&nbsp;with oxtail.&nbsp; You can't even taste the cabbage in it.&nbsp; I think it just gives the soup texture.&nbsp; Ohmigod, its good.&nbsp;Here it is: &nbsp; Ingredients:2 packets of Oxtail Adobo All Purpose Seasoning with pepper Skippy Peanut Butter - Creamy (the one with the green lid) Green beans or String Beans -  cutCabbage or eggplant (cut in 8 pieces) &nbsp; 1. Wash the meat and cover the oxtail with adobo powder. 2. Put in the pot with a lot of water and boil for 1 to 1 1/2 hrs untiltender.&nbsp; Check once in awhile to make sure all the water doesn't evaporate and burn the meat. Definitely put a timer so you won't forget. After an hour, poke some oxtail with a fork and if you can go through the meat specially the one that has some fat, that's good. 2. Set aside and let it cool. Put the pot in the fridge for around 2 hours to freeze the fat. 3. Take off the top yellowish part (fat) until you can see the broth part. 4. Boil again and put a lot of adobo powder and stir.&nbsp; Put in Medium heat. 5. Put the peanut butter and stir.&nbsp; If you're using 2 packets of oxtail, putat least 4 spoonfull of peanut butter. 6. Put the cut green beans or string beans.&nbsp; Cover the pot. 7. After 2 minutes, put the eggplant or cabbage.&nbsp; When the vegetables aredone you can turn it off. 8. Taste to find out if you need more peanut butter or adobo powder or waterand stir. 9. It tastes better the next day because the meat soaks up the peanutbutter. Enjoy!

      Just got back from D.C. a few days ago.  First time outta the south since I've been on the mainland.  Monuments, museums, walking- walking- walking.... but all in all, just about the nicest weekend in a while.  Something about putting distance between home and work and leaving it all behind and running away- just in a responsible way, ya know?  Short little adventures that make it easy to imagine what it would be like to live in another city, what it might be like to live like they do, what it might be like to live under different circumstances.  Makes it easy to daydream.  Makes it easy to wonder at how different people can be just because of geography...also how much everyone is the same.    Riding the metro can be one reason why northerners seem more well read.  We spend so much of our day commuting- our attention is sapped by the almighty automobile.  They get to read up on current events and so on.  Yet most of the time, I think the women who read on the metro use a book or a paper as a privacy screen.  Something to shield stares.  Security device, perhaps.  They are careful not to look too attractive, and honestly, I don't blame em' a bit.  Sketchy looking characters on the metro.  The bums that sleep on the benches in monument park, the frantic looking guys that talk to themselves on the street- I think I could live without that in my life.  It certainly makes things interesting- uncomfortable.  Do you ever become jaded to that?  Do you just stop seeing?  How do you put blinders on to that?  Really, I don't think I'm the right person to live in a city like that.  There's only one corner that I'm really exposed to bums here in Dallas.  I try not to look.  I try not to reason that these people are more than likely con men.  I try to supress that urge to pity them.  Is it right to supress that?  I dunno.  I just don't want to look.  If that's escapist, so what?  Heartless and cowardly?  No, just realistic.  I refuse to make the situation worse because of this person's lack of initiative.  The world has to have its leeches, I guess.  I just won't allow myself to be a victim to that.    Listening to the Cocteau Twins right now- The Thinner the Air.  Its what proves to me that the human voice can reach ethereal heights.  Enchanting......  Contemplating real estate, pharmacuetical sales rep, or some type of sales position.  Its kind of funny, but I am still using the way I look to make my way.  I don't have a problem with that.  I just think that its a little amusing-- in kind of a things run in circles kind of way.  I'll knock em dead.  I'll be good...

      I hate that my tarot cards haven't come in the mail yet.  I found the most gorgeous set on aeclectic, but I guess they're back ordering them.  Its called the gilded tarot and I could wax poetic about how tbey are in a class of their own and they are the most visually pleasing deck I have seen in ages.  Perfection!  Now, if only I could get them to send me a deck!
