        Brought Ebbi, my cat, to the vet. The lower part of her jaw was imflamed. Not too sure what caused it. One of her tooth is loose too. But think I'll wait till her jaw recovers before tackling her dental problem. She's almost 12 year old. Think that translate to 64 yrs in human age. So not advisable to stress her too much. She gets rather stressed up and nervous whenever she visits the vet.     I just found out that I'm not allowed to keep big dogs in our HDB flats. What's up with that?!? I really want a Golden Retriever. I wonder how firm are the authorities on the rules. Will have to check it up. Maybe I could pretend I'm blind and need the help of a seeing-dog.  There's going to be a full-dressed rehearsal at the National Stadium tonight for the National Day celebration on 9 August. I might join a friend Leon to shoot some photos of the fireworks. In Singapore, everything must be done to 'perfection' so we have rehearsals for almost everything. We even have a rehearsal culling of chickens during the Bird-Flu scare!

        Ok.  I managed to sort out most of the stuffs.  Tried to customise the look of my blog.  But was too tired.  Had a long day.  Luckily it's almost weekend.   Dr. S returned from Canada after an absence of almost 4 months.  It's not easy working for him.   He's really demanding when it comes to work.  I'm almost drowning in my workload and he thinks I'm not efficient.  Oh well.  No point in arguing with him.   Looking forward to the weekend.  I haven't done 'serious' blading for a while.  Went with my kids last Sunday.  But I spent more time gearing up the kids than blading.  Anyway I'll have to start soon 'cos I think I'm putting on weight.  I'm still a novice.  Really envy those speed-skaters zooming pass me along the tracks at East Coast Park.  One of these days.....   I'm thinking of picking up Tai-Chi too.   Actually there's a lot of things I wanna do.  I just couldn't find the time.

         Hmm... not too sure whether I'm wasting my time.  I always keep a diary.  And this seems fun.  Even my bro is into blogging.

        My husband, Fang, went for his late night jog just now. On his way back, he came by the back of our HDB block. He saw a cat, crouching near the door of the service chute. The chute was on the ground floor, directly below our window.  It was too dark to clearly. But he thought the cat looked like Ebbi. He went nearer for a closer look but the cat darted into the service chute.  Fang came back home and told me he thought he saw Ebbi. We grabbed a torch-light and rushed down.    Fang opened the door of the service chute wide but there was no sign of the cat. I took the light from Fang and went in. It didn't smell too nice in there and the pipes were covered with cobweb.  And right there in a corner was Ebbi! We found her at last!

        I managed to catch the re-run of the first audition for Singapore Idol last night. Many thanks to Gu who called me.   I've read about the funny antics of some of the Idol-wannabes,so immediately I rushed to switch on the TV set and my newly-purchased DVD recorder.  Titles have already been affectionately bestowed on some of the rejects. They are (ta da!)....

        I was sorting through my photographs and I realized something.  I took most of the photographs and hence I wasn’t inside many of the photographs.  I also did most of the wedding video shoots of my closer friends.  And as I looked through the video clips, I felt kind of left out of their celebrations because I was always behind the camera.  Ok. I’m in the posed group shots. But I’ve never been captured in any of the candid shots. And I’m definitely not in the video clips.  I've missed out on most of the fun.     I especially missed being in the bride's Ah Yees' team.  The bride’s Ah Yees (or "sisters") would be at the main entrance blocking the groom from entry until red-packets were given or until the girls were done with the teasing.  But I couldn’t be part of that girls’ team at all.  I couldn’t even talk because my voice would come out very loud in the video.

        Most of my friends know I’m moonlighting as a wedding/events videographer. What started out as a hobby has turned into a little side-income for me. But my real interest is still in photography. Videography, well, helps finance my photography hobby.  Equipment, films, processing costs, servicing, photography books etc are not exactly cheap.  Oh yes. I’m still using films.  I use both film and digital.   I can never understand why there are always flame-wars in photography forums about digital and film photography.  Each system has its advantages and limitations.  Even more ridiculous are die-hard fans of brand names.  I'm a Canon-user but I don't criticise Nikon etc.  Ultimately it's the person behind the camera that creates the photo.  Cameras are tools.

        No mood to work at all. I ordered 2 sets of PC for the office and they arrived yesterday. So I spent my time installing the softwares and configuring the PCs instead.  Ebbi has been gone for 5 days now. I placed some food outside our door in case she comes home. But I think some other neighbourhood cat has been eating the food.  I have called the SPCA to check if someone brought her in. But no news so far. I've got a feeling I will never see her again.

      Yesterday was our National Day.    We accepted a friend's invitation for a boat cruise to watch the fireworks from Singapore River.  We had dinner on board and there were games organised to keep the kids busy.  The sea was kind of choppy and I felt a bit queasy.  I ate very little, though dinner spread was pretty good, just in case I get sea-sick.  I'm usually not affected by rough seas, but I wasn't sleeping well for the last couple of days because of Ebbi.    The fireworks display was a bit of a let down.  I expected more as it was also the last NDP with Mr Goh as our PM.  There's another fireworks this coming Sunday. It's the last display to close off Singapore Fireworks Festival.  I believe the display is by a team from HK.  Will need to go early cos I'm sure there'll be a bad jam.  I haven't found Ebbi yet.

      No sign of her.  I sure hope she's ok.  I put up a notice at the lift lobby on the ground floor.  Someone tore it away.  Hopefully that's a sign of guilt that he has Ebbi and does not want to return it.    I hope she's ok.  I miss her.  Every night when I'm working or reading, she'll be lying on my lap or next to me.  She used to sit on my monitor.  After I changed to a LCD, she found a warmer spot, tucked between me and the back of my chair.   I really hope she's ok.

      I can't fine her anywhere.  She was around this morning when I left for work.  Fang and the kids were home.  Fang said he left the main door opened so Ebbi might have ran out.  But that's so unlike Ebbi.  She's always very timid and will dash back into the house when strangers come.  Fang suspect she might have fallen out of the window.  (My old cat Sandy fell out of our window once. We;re staying on the 4th floor so she survived the fall.) Ebbi didn't answered my calls in the afternoon when I home from work. But that was not unusual as she would be hiding and sleeping somewhere in the house in the afternoons.  We brought the kids to the gym class, dinner and home again.  But she's still did not appear.  We searched the house and walked around the area downstairs.   Still no sign of Ebbi.  I'm leaving the door open tonight.  Sure hope she comes back soon.

        My thoughts on the news report so far... (If you disagree, we can discuss. If you don't like, that's your problem!)  Very strange defense by LTA's lawyer. He claimed that NLC is being thoroughly irresponsible when,   Claim #1  - LTA has, as far back as a year ago, pointed out that there is a flaw in NLC's design. It was made known to them but NLC refused to accept.  My take  - LTA is   urlLink  The Authority   ! And if they can't control NLC, who else can?   Claim #2  - NLC's PE allegedly said that LTA should not interfere with NLC's design.  My take  - And LTA actually swallowed that quietly? Oh! Come on!   Claim #3  - LTA has engaged a professor to assess NLC's design in early 2004 and apparently he too concluded that failure is imminent.  My take  - Since everyone is so sure of potential failure in the excavation, why didn't LTA stop the work? LTA is the paying master!     Claim #4  - NLC has knowingly ignored warning signs given by the inclinometers.  My take  - Wouldn't the lack of action on LTA's part implied the same?     Claim #5  - The warnings signs were picked up in year 2003, yet NLC carried on with the work, despite warnings by LTA.    My take  - Why just issue warnings? Why didn't LTA stepped in and put a definite stop to it?   Claim #6  - NLC's PE has manipulated the calculations each time the trigger value is exceeded to claim that all is ok and proposed to increase the level of trigger value.  My take  - That is equivalent to changing the 13A circuit breaker in a 13A plug to say 20A. Why? because it keeps triggering off at 13A, so increase it lor!  And LTA accepted it? If LTA disagree, why then further excavations were allowed to proceed?     NLC is liable since the design was "flawed" as confirmed by 17 "experts' reports" and actual site conditions indicated that there was definitely a serious problem at the site. So I don't think NLC can run away from the responsibility.     But what's LTA's role? Shouldn't LTA have taken a more pro-active approach?  In any contract, the main contractor has to submit calculations to the QP and authorities for approval. I believe in this site, the QP is also a LTA staff. LTA also has its own supervising staff on site. If LTA'sengineers and supervisors weren't supervising on site, what the hell were they doing?

      I wonder if this is perculiar only to Singapore.  We have acronyms for almost anything! Mostly TLAs.   1. The moment we step out of the house, we'll see SBS, MRT, TIBS.   2. Don't like public transport? Get a COE and buy a car.  3. Be familiar with GIA's IDAC in case there's an accident.  You'll probably need AAS's help too! 4. Once you're on the roads, you'll travel on PIE, ECP, TPE, AYE, SLE, KJE, BKE.   5. Problems with roads? Complain to LTA.   6. But usually congestions are due to PUB, SCV, TAS digging up the roads, NPB trimming trees or or HDB carrying out their IUP or MUP. 7. When you're going into town, you've got to watch out for ERP in CBD and make sure cash card is in the IU. 8. You need money? Draw from ATMs of POSB, DBS, UOB, OCBC, OUB, HSBC. Don't like cash? You could NETS it. 9. If you are seriously ill, go to the A&E of either SGH, TTSH, NUH, AMKH or AH.  If not, go to your GP. 10. Make sure you top up your CPF so that you can get NSS and ERS. 11. Get proper education from JC, ITE, SP, NP, NYP, TP, NUS or NTU. 12. Don't litter or you may be isssued CWO. 13. PCK is best in Singapore and some say JB!  Too lazy to go on... you get my point.   ps  FYI, there's a   urlLink  Netherlands' website  with the most comprehensive Singapore acronyms I've ever seen.  I don't even know half of them!  BTW pay attention to the heading written in Dutch! It's hilarious!

        Yesterday (02.08.04) was the first day of the public inquiry into the collapse of Nicoll Highway. On 20 April 2004, there was a cave in at a MRT deep excavation site, causing a 100m section of the Nicoll Highway to collapse. 4 persons died and the extent of damage makes it one of the most serious construction accidents here in SIngapore. (I'll try to post a description of the incident together with some photos in a separate posting.)

        as it's taking me a longer time to understand this CSS thingy. It would have been a breeze for me a few years back. Of course, I'm doing it the hard way, slogging through articles, learning by trial-&amp;-error. I wonder if there's a parttime class somewhere teaching this.  Was woken up real early this Sunday morning, at 5.30am!! My hubby woke up at 4am (??) and watched Jonny English. And his laughter woke the 2 kids up. And all of them decided to wake me up too! Anyway, since we were all up, we drove to East Coast Park to have breakfast and some inline skating. Healthy life-style huh.  Surprisingly the carparks were quite filled up. There were many early-risers doing their morning exercise. We tried to catch the sunrise, but it was too cloudy.

       1. HP no longer means Hewlett-Packard, 2. You start making enquiries for Transfiguration classes,    3. You sign up for Arts class thinking it's the Defense Against Dark Arts Class, 4. You reach for your broom when you leave the house, 5. You shout "Expelliarmus" instead of the usual f**k off, (heehee) 6. You shake your photographs hoping that the people in the pictures would start moving,   7. You start checking your mailbox for Daily Prophet,   8. You scan the sky for owls,    more to come....  (Not that I've too much free time on my hand. but hey! I need to de-stress right?)
