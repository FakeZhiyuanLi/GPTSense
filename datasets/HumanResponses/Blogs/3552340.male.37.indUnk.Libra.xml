      So there I was...minding my own business, or minding someone else's business I don't really remember.  We attended the Street Bash or Street Blast last night for Kansas City's gay Pride kick off.  I ran into a bunch of people from bowling and old friends from who-knows-where.    They had only two beer tents set up and the wait for a beer was about 20 minutes.  It was a mess.  but I didn't do anything to help with the festivities so I guess I can't complain.  After the street party was over we all went to the Dixie Belle for drinks and I heard I did some dancing.  Jon told me that Richie and Jeff were going to fight some guy that kicked Richie but the fight never happened.  I love a good bar fight.  Suddenly it was time to go home.  Along the way Jon fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into a curve and got a flat tire.  The tow truck said they would be an hour or more.  This was 3am and this bitch was ready to hitch a ride with any willing stranger.  Richie showed up somehow and changed our tire.    My life is so glamourous I could puke.

       From Brian:   Be it understood, our nation was founded upon the principle of separation of church and state.  And thus I must ask, is the passage of Amendment No. 2 in Missouri the creation of a law respecting an establishment of religion?  Is this action a violation of the 1st Amendment of The Bill of Rights of The United States of America?  “Amendment I:  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”  By stating that a marriage is a relationship only “between one man and one woman”, I would have to interpret this action as the intrusion of a religion upon the people.  Please be mindful, same sex couples are only requesting the states to recognize their relationships, not the churches.  Therefore, the issue before us is civil, not divine.  I do have a relationship with God, and a true respect and admiration for other faiths.  However, I do not believe my religious beliefs should be imposed upon others, and vice versa.  Simply put, the passage of Amendment No. 2 in Missouri appears to be taking one step back towards acceptance of the 18th Century British Monarchy that our forefathers rejected, and one more sign of the weakening of the separation of church and state.  Regardless of one’s religious devotion, I believe we must set aside our differences to come together as one people and uphold The Bill of Rights.  Brian Protheroe St. Louis, Missouri

       From Stacy :  I am not a Missourian, however, most of my loved ones whether family or friends are from Missouri.  Yesterday’s election on Amendment 2 was more than a joke.  You place a subject on a ballot for the citizens to vote on, yet give very little back ground or pro’s and con’s to the subject.  Next to no publicity on the ballot except for how people feel it is such an abomination to our society.    Why are tax dollars paying an election on meaning of a word (Marriage) and its definition in the Constitution, not to mention the tax dollars to take the effort to actually change it!!  It is not clear and apparent that everyone who has skin and bones are equal in the US and not to be discriminated against?  Was there not already laws prohibiting legal marriage?  Is it not clear that we are all tax paying citizens also and it has nothing to do with color, race, creed, or religion?? It is not clear that two people who have planned a life together whether it is a man and a woman or two of the same sex is done with love and caring.  Think back to when it was frowned on blacks and whites to hang out, use the same fountain, go to school together or for a black person to so much as look at a white person in the eyes- now they are MARRYING each other!!!!  What is the difference?  Maybe someone should take the time to put on the ballot to change the meaning of the word PREJUDICE!!!  Just when you would think we are finally getting past all the prejudice in America!  This is a sad day!!  Mayor Barnes can put all her time and effort into LOOKS of a new downtown Missouri, but not once show any support for ALL and I mean ALL her people, including ones who voted for her!  One lady who owns a bar in Missouri, has a picture of her with Mayor Barnes and is soooooooo proud of her and all she stands for and guess what---this friend is GAY!!  This picture is in a predominately GAY bar!!  Again where was any support for the PEOPLE?  We are all human, with love, compassion, responsibilities, tax paying, hard working and living normal lives.  Yes, be proud of your new arena; be ashamed of the results for Amendment 2.  There could have been more support publicized.  Such a large subject that last for a life time and such little attention compared to some building going up which probably had thousands of dollars in how many advertisements?  How about Amendment 1—the gambling?  How much was spent on that ballot?   I have a “wife” and we got married in your state and now I regret the location that we chose.  I will never regret the love and affection I have for her and her entire loving and supportive family!!!  We had more than two hundred family, fellow workers and friends attend without prejudice!!  What a glorious day!!  We had discussed moving to Missouri on several occasions, but I refuse to do so now.   Are you all so worried that two people of the same sex building a life together with children are a threat to society to actually legally be married?  Do not the children of these homes deserve the recognition and benefits of two loving parents?  If I were to pass away some day, is my spouse who spent 20 plus years with me deserving of my benefits or do you really think the government is?   From Jill:   I really hadn't been following closely the vote in Missouri because I figured it had NO way of passing. I based my assumption on the fact that the good citizens of  your state had rejected John Ashcroft's Senate candidacy four years ago, choosing to vote for a dead man over a living "Christian"  reactionary who was afraid of calico cats.I will say, as an aside, that I no longer believe in the concept of "marriage". I think ALL unions - both gay and straight - should be civil unions with the couples going to a religious entity if they want to be religiously blessed as "marriage". But that's not the issue here.But I do think you two have a couple of choices. You can stay and fight the idiocy as voted into law or you can pull up stakes from KC and move to a more gay-friendly area.  I hope you stay and fight - although sometimes we all just become too tired and discouraged to put up with crap in our lives.If this is the Missouri gay community's Stonewall, well, then so be it.I think Jon touches on some good issues. Years ago I heard of a tactic that was used by the gay community of a city to show just how important the dollars of the community was to the economy at large. (I can't remember what city it was but I think it would work well in a smaller, less liberal city than, say, NYC or SF).  Anyway, each dollar bill spent by  shoppers was marked with "This is a dollar spent by a member of the gay community". You could probably get many straight "friends and family" to do this as well.  I know it sounds crackpot - and I wish I could remember where I read about it - but it worked very well.  Actually, come to think of it, it could work nationwide.And, what about court challenges? Has anyone contacted the ACLU?Bush's reelection will cause horrendous problems for all liberals, or even, non-conservatives. His next term in office will see the resignation and appointment of three Supreme Court judges. We can't allow this to happen. The next four years will be a living hell that will take decades to recover from if we allow Bush to be reelected. There are many "voices to be heard" in our attempt to take back our America.  Just know that there are many straights out there who are sympathetic and will help you if we can.  Let me know.  Jill   From Mark:   I have been out all day and didn't get my e-mail until just now. I want to write something on my blog, but I don't know what to write. Welcome to my testing ground... I worked from 6 in the morning until about 8:45 last night for the Wyandotte County Election Office. I enjoyed the work and had a relatively good day. I got home last night and turned on the news to see how my friend Jason Klumb was doing for the state treasurer dealy-bob. That and I was concerned about the Holden/Whats-her-name dealy-bob. I should interject: I was sure Amendment 2 was going to pass. I'm not so naive as to think a majority of voting Missourians care about any homosexual they might know in their life... however, when the screen popped up with "70% Yes, 30% No", I was floored. I figured it would be "60% Yes" at best. I was (and still am) disgusted. I'm frightened. I'm angry. I'm lots of thing. I don't want to spend any more time in Missouri than I absolutely have to, and I am determined not to spend any money in Missouri (which is going to make bowling an issue, guys). Will Missouri miss my money? I'd guess not. But if I had to choose between taking my business to someone who at least treated me as an equal and someone who apparently views me as less-than-human, it wouldn't be a lengthy debate in my skull. Is Kansas any better? Well, they're not the First State of Hate, for one thing. Attempts to constitutionalize bigotry and hatred have failed in Kansas... but, again, I'm not naive--or at most I'm only naive enough to think Missouri would top out the "Yes" votes at 60%--I figure Kansas will get around to it soon enough. Work-wise, the plan is to no longer teach in Missouri after my contract is up at the end of this upcoming school year. If things don't go downhill super-fast in Kansas, I figure I'll teach on this side of the state line... maybe. I'm thinking about going back out to California, or--depending on what happens in November--checking out the possibility of teaching in Canada. Maybe even citizenship. What can I say? I'm not a fighter. Or maybe I am a fighter, but I fight myself every day just to have the will to deal with everything I've set myself up to deal with... and the stuff I didn't set myself up to deal with (except in that I was born at the wrong time, in the wrong nation, with the "wrong" sexual preference). I don't think I have the fight for this sort of thing. Maybe for no sort of thing any more. I think it would be nice living in a country that didn't spend my formative years trying to convince me what a great a free country we live in, where everyone has the same opportunities... when in truth: not so much. Somehow this has made me not want to talk to my straight friends at all. I keep thinking how it's no skin off their noses. I keep thinking how easy it would have been for them at the ballot box to think, "gee, maybe I really DO want this to pass". Or, for the ones who live in Kansas, how they might secretly feel this was the right thing to happen. I know this is irrational. But I lost my "Rational Club" membership years ago. I spoke to one of my straight married female friends tonight on the phone when I got home from work... and she's a great person, and I'm sure she voted against it, but she didn't seem to understand my feelings about this. I just wanted to scream into the phone, "Let's put YOU on the sub-human list, and see if you feel like singing and dancing with a tra-la-la and a whoop-dee-do!" But then I figured the last part would make it sound funnier than I meant it to. Short version (for those of you who thought to skip to the bottom to see if there is a short version): I'm done. I'm outta here. I'm not going to MO unless I have to. I do enough to make myself feel like crap... I don't need any help from a state's constitution, thanks. Mark   More From Stacy:   I am aware that the amendment does not mention a gay marriage ban, but what is the difference between saying that and defining it between one man and one woman.  As far as Massachusetts, yes they fought for common wealth and the right to claim each other as one union- not to be discriminated against for sexual reasons or preference or life style, but for those who “actually” love each other and are not just running to the altar to make a statement.   I am one of those who will only do it for the right reasons.  That is what the frustration is.  Massachusetts is heavily populated with alternative life style living folks, and I am sure some- not all did tie the knot to make a statement more than for reasons of love.  Why should that be such an issue?  Why would our President want to deprive us of rights for benefits due to anyone when we are all equal in the eyes of God?  I was raised in a very religious home and went to a Christian school.  I love God and try earnestly to live a good hard working loyal life to myself, God, my family and my friends.  What would it truly hurt that we are treated equally?  Why make is such a law that it is ever forbidden to be recognized as anything other than sub-human because we choose a different path?  Julie and I want to have children and are scared to death of the “what if this happens” down the road to one of us. What battles we have to fight for a family would is not fair for folks living in the US.  I am glad that the Federal level denied the change.  It simply stated is one word for our anguish- “equality”.

      Various musings from friends that I want to save:   From Jon :  Just some thoughts I wanted to get out tonight...As I watch with the poll results with anticipation, it quickly starts to turn to disgust and becomes clearer and clearer that something is wrong with the citizens of Missouri -- as the ban on gay marriage being written into the state constitution becomes a reality. Are we, as gay people, second class citizens? Do we ask for rights outside of what every person is entitled to - the rights of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness...with whomever we chose? We're not second class citizens and we're not asking for special rights. Essentially the state of Missouri is telling us whom we can love and create relationships with.  I don't see how or why citizens of Missouri would discriminate against us. Is our money tainted? Do we not have productive jobs which helps keep our state and our nation's economy flowing -- not to mention that we pay taxes just like everyone else. Weren't our forefathers rebelling against England for "taxation without representation?" Will this lead to the Missouri rendition of Stonewall?Who will fight for what is right? Who will throw down the gauntlet and challenge this vote with lawsuits? Who will cry out and demand to be heard? Will the ACLU step up for us? We need to step up for ourselves...If we can't take care of our position in our state, can we take care of our position in the nation and strip George W. of his dictatorship? His continued reign could be the beginning of a gay Holocaust. Let's not wait to find out if that would become a reality. Please don't let the passage of this amendment discourage you. The fight has just begun and our voices will be heard. What happened today and tonight is just the beginning in a new challenge for all of us. We can not let this most unconstitutional amendment go unnoticed. We shall overcome. jon    From Julie :  I hear Jon's cry below, this is a very sad and a very discriminatory move on the part of Missourians....which to mention until this morning WAS a state I WAS proud to be born and raised in.  That support has ended today.  I feel extremely forlorn and lost as a result of yesterday's election.  I finally know how other's feel and have felt regarding discrimination....in any form.  It makes you wonder who they will single out the next time.  My mind just won't stop trying to figure out a way around this extremely unfortunate decision and infringment of my rights.  I have been mulling over ideas of ways to get back at our government and not allow them to get me down and take away my rights.  My plan includes beginning an extremely agressive retirement savings plan and retiring at the earliest age possible, just so that I get my minuscule portion out of the government.  Money that is more than rightfully mine.  And God forbid, someone tries to stop me from visiting "my wife" in a hospital, they better have security beefed up that day, 'cause it's going to take an army to try to stop me!!!!!  Ideas/manipulative thoughts:  We could all just marry someone "of the opposite sex" (and gay of course), just so that someone continues to get the money that my loved one rightfully deserves.  Talk about abuse of the marital right, marrying someone that you are not in love with, just so that you can abide by our wonderful consitution and get what is rightfully yours.  Thankfully, I currently work in Kansas because I definitely don't want to be working in Missouri and giving them all of my tax dollars.  After the November elections, what will our options be of places to take up residence......Massachusetts, ___________, __________, ????  I still cannot believe that my tax dollars are being used to define a word in the constitution.  I can just imagine what the person is getting paid to "reconstruct" the constituation to discriminate against us.  Missouri already has laws in place that forbid us from getting "legally" married, how much ammunition do they need to make sure that this discrimination scars us for life.   I say screw MISSOURI!  We can and will overcome this abuse of our rights!  Count me in in the fight to win back what is rightfully ours............OUR LIFE, OUR LIBERTY AND OUR PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for listening!!!!  It feels good to get this off my chest!
