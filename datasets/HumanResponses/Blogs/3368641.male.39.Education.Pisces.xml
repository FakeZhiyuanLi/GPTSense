      Predictable   hiding behind your masks and online productions crying foul - crying victim every time that you get revealed some playful masters make it their hobby to peel away the labels if you are not up to being exposed for your limitations then unplug from your fiction maker and return asleep to consensus reality  you wanted to have it both ways to feel the fire warm you and have use of it as a weapon you got burned twice as bad as someone who has never learned the place for humility in relationships and activities  amongst pseudo personalities where truth can't be trusted handed out as hors d'oeuvres  how quickly the victim in you puffed up their chest  and like the potentate of the sand box you kicked gritty words on anyone that dared to see you naked and were not impressed with the view  i am quietly amused at the very idea  that this angry little child was given the lead role at center stage it should have spoke volumes to the incredulous audience but they were afraid that in revealing her fiction it would somehow reflect off on them and they would have to admit their part in creating the life and living their own lies  this fear of owning scripts sometimes takes all the fun out of watching actors and actresses digging deep  into well produced roles their hopes for some golden reward laugh trax or stand up applause for the carrying of their crosses for being victims and heroines has made the plot lines  into something bordering  on predictable   ©2003 DC Vision

      please don't hate me because i am so beautiful i broke bottles unconsciously and crawled across the cut glass  as a raging spectacle with everyone knowing how stupid in appearance the smartest little underachiever was in his closet of costumes  go ahead and laugh at me i know the tumultuous humor well as i burned bridges  and lit fires under the asses of unsuspecting dreamers then sat back and watched them scurry around like ants under looking glasses  i like being quantum blueberries dancing and spinning  the last drop out of each moment i dare you to try to keep up with me you have a lot to learn if you think i ever stood still long enough for you to label me or value me or judge me or be like me  speaking in tongues or treading water i cannot make out a single word or action that you display your chance to hold  my waning attention span is rapidly reaching quantum speeds just when you thought you've read me i'm gone  ©2003 DC Vision

      don't I wish  in this hanging moment that I could hold on to each surfacing emotion burning and coaxing me ever deeper into the layers of you exposed so that a clue to the production that became you would reveal itself to me  in this moment I can see decades as dust I can capture the untimely death of a child and the untimely birth of a man  I empty the vacuum by speaking the words "I love you, and am proud of you" in this moment a perfect stranger becomes a father and a perfect stranger becomes a son  ©2003 DC Vision

      though this night may seem to be the end of me and the bruises i carry brings me to the floor again i will survive you as i have before and know this new look fucker for i have finally crossed that line  i am not a weak woman though sometimes you made me feel it but the raw pain has broken through my fear of you like an animal caged the master shall know the true meaning of rage as i scope for weaponry  there is a resolve born  of my relation to countless women through the ages that found themselves liberated in the dawn from a long line of worthless men   ©2002 DC Vision

      the world crashes in the lines blur and I am riding an updraft of distraction  the window is opened and I am flying I am out of the zone I am a dim bulb with no focus no magic no moment to savor  lost again in a fast forward world rewinding and rehashing the same shit over and over till it fills up your head and haunts every tick of the clock   and I fight the undertow in my thirst for silence   ©2002 DC Vision

      we've got tumbleweeds traversing synapses arid neurologically speaking and yet the fiction makers keep spitting out scripts and we keep lapping them up like our taste buds didn't shrivel up long ago from the pabulum  thirsting for a drink and famished for a meal we get artificial calories in familiar originality from a roomful of short attention spans we get bursts of inspiration without any perspiration and steady by degrees we agree to dummy it down  such a pretty production pedestrian passersby with averted eyes and arsenals of excuses for why they get up each day to return to the same stage always a handful of #'s away from winning the lottery  and always secretly  welcoming any audience to read their yard sale paperback autobiographies that will pretend that they are interested to sit through this long tiresome releasing of sequels   ©2003 DC Vision

      I am sunlight captured I am steadfast resistance to weather and man's self-importance  I burst into colors every autumn just to laugh at the joy to be alive  I am host and I am fed by my proximity to the land that feeds me and upon me  I am born of a seed and I die  and am returned to the dance of hosts and hosted  my passing unobtrusive my life many homes but i only noticed the perfection of this space I grew roots in my place  your life expectancies your photo opportunities didn't really matter... they really do not matter to the trees   ©2002 DC Vision

      winter skies are manifesting every conceivable shade of grey leadened by the sway of jet streams promising better times and sunnier days  but it is in these shades of grey that I find a suitable state of contemplative emotional clarity it's never black or white stormy or fair long enough to carry me off somewhere that I don't want to be or where I should be  winter skies are manifesting a resonating  shade of grey for me not to fade or fall or rage or run someplace inside between  © 2003 DC Vision

      dancing the mysteries into life naked in a world of hobbyists if this were not my fate I would be channel surfing from amateur drama and strife  pop there goes another cell you never know how fragile your best selling fiction is until you come face to face with something that can unveil your hell  I am susceptible to times like this I cannot innocently walk by  a long row of shiny dominoes without giving the closest one  a rough and tumbled kiss  drown in your passions get drunk on your favorite poisons I am an island paradise in your turbulent ocean of self gluttony and rations  my pulse rate never changes my interest level never wanes but if you blink or think too long I will move onto someone who can handle these exchanges  bye bye say I precious little one what you think you may know of our passing experiences will leave you holding smoke when this long day is done  ©2003 DC Vision

      whet this appetite in exploration  of all our mysteries swollen like me like you this rapture is an extension  from the glow of our satiating one another  in this moment pleasure invokes a new course and a new touch senses lit up by  this peak experience everything comes together comes outside of borders simply comes  spent we find a new rhythm entwined in afterglow in aftertaste  as one we fall asleep into this endless dream of Love  © 2003 DC Vision

      sometimes when I am quiet and in tune  I feel the cellular world within pop and fizzle as a message is delivered from this appetite to the body it inhabits and in a flash an arm lifts to light yet another cigarette in contemplation  and sometimes I feel nothing at all except the impulse and in a flash an arm lifts to light yet another cigarette in unconsciousness  and sometimes I feel everything at once and in a flash an arm lifts and I forget why so I light another cigarette to punctuate the moment of forgetfulness  and sometimes I have to remember that I smoke too much and think too little for my own good  © 2002 DC Vision

      what I have been led to believe that you are a mirror of me I no longer accept in totality you are not reflecting me when you are cruel when you are loveless when you are without grace  I am not searching my psyche any longer for clues to my inner child's shortcomings I am seeing your darkness for what it really is: it is yours I walk away from your emotional routines  and find sanctuary in hearts like mine I will disown your world and finish with this spiritual charade  I shudder to think that I have judged myself so harshly for so many years for so much bullshit go be king of your mountain no one cares but yourself  the mighty will roar from their shit heaps across chasms of self-importance while I shall remain free from the tyranny  of defecation elevation  if you don't give a shit don't fertilize with it  ©2003 DC Vision

      I am one who goes by an alias to detach my self from myself it's a constant tug of war between heredity and being a heretic  would you prefer it  if I fashioned a lie so as not to embarrass  the facade of the family let me offer you a trade:  I will acquiesce  when you can swallow this ten pound suck pill then you will know how soluble  it has been to be blood tied to your delusions  let it dissolve on the tongues of familial back biting swallow decades of degradation and of futile expectations based on nothing but an impossible climb away from the womb  ten pounds worth of  weightlessness of ideals and ten pounds worth of underachieving so we could all live up to the family tradition:  four hundred years ago fresh off the boat he started stealing horses but I trumped the bastard by riding one into the sunset... sometimes history corrects itself, too   ©2003 DC Vision

      ring ring machine picks up  not here screening calls leave a message if it makes you feel better  I have fallen hard for this cave and its interior decorations how it fits  whatever surfaces into consciousness  unhealthy maybe but I'm enjoying the fade out lost my appetite for civilization and its discontents and its spokespeople  I'm having a daydream in your nightmare where only foreign tongues are spoken by the hard of hearing it's as entertaining as it is frustrating  thought maybe if I could slip away unnoticed I could explore down the corridors where the conditioned fear to tread  I've got one foot out and tangled webs struggle to hold one foot in I stand between what I long for with a foothold in each  ©2003 DC Vision

      in this quiet hour  lost in a smoke  and starlit skies  i wander the universe  in my head  or is it my heart  somewhere between  these thoughts haunt me  but now i am made  to be painfully aware   the truths that were hidden  in this awareness i can see  and my memories of blindness  have a nostalgic appeal to me  we are vessels of needs  defending psychotic turf  truth is as new to me  as your ears are to hearing it   but in the quiet hours  with judge and jury of self  we are naked without noise  and revealed...  we are liars of faith  we are liars of love  we are liars of caring  we are liars that we have  anything left to give  and we are liars that we want  nothing in return  let us all stay unconscious  because only if we are  deaf dumb and blind  will there be nothing left  to lie about  or any annoying conscience  to know that truth  is sometimes the greatest  lie of them all  ©2003 DC Vision

      We all die alone, going with ease or fighting all the way, into the unknowable, yet often surmised mystery of death.  No one may be known completely, even our closest confidants never truly sharing the private thoughts the separate moments that makes us singularities.  We all die alone anxious for a witness, with proof of our existence in the final fact...  that we are not alone in our yearning.  ©2003 DC Vision

      I have rode the wake of the ebb and flow of tides for some time now I feel I'm more relaxed treading the waters within and without me  I have been born into a weighted responsibility that hangs between humility and whatever created the universe I am learning to swim the blur of this metaphysical mile that it may touch both other lives and mine  what do I know of being a holy man I feel inadequate and unworthy to be on any pedestal  that is not of my making or understanding  but free will is the delusion  of the dreamer and my eyes are wide open I am obedient in this calling and in this fine line so that no shadows are cast If it were about me I would find it easier  to sleep  and if it were about me I'd never of allowed the tide to take me the symbology has not  eluded me that the ocean is measured in 'fathoms' because swimming a metaphysical mile offshore feels like 6 feet under understanding  ©2003 DC Vision

      there are times that I get trapped in a moment the way light plays on the water the dance of whispery winds the background noise and the activity of nature beckons me on to be a part of the wider scene and I experience this  through the mind of a child  were it easy to deflate the importance and set down the weight of the world I would find fields of laughter to lie in and trees to climb in abandon time would cease its stranglehold and responsibilities would turn  into blowing bubbles riding the winds of carefree afternoons I would chase them down to the ends of the earth and learn to love again through the mind of a child  I watch parents destroy this gift making elastic minds into concrete to match the nature around them the children have haunted eyes and attention deficit disorders because they are plugged so securely  into electricity and nourished on brand name  cacophonies within this external nightmare there remains an innocent child waiting for someone to wake up and remind them of what is real  can you bring it back to summer with lazy days playing in the yard when we didn't have to grow up so fast or deal with adult concerns take the time to see them and take the time to hear them and lose yourself in the wonder of the mind of a child   ©2003 DC Vision

      when I am blessed  with the eyes to see and the ears to hear you I stand upon a mountain and can see forever through your eyes I can feel the layout  of the inner terrain I can love myself by loving you and this grace spills out into the world  when I found my footing atop the mountain I looked around to see the lofty community I tried to speak of joy and was told to be silent I wanted to dance in the thin air and was told to just be It's not that I crave titillation just an enactment of this liberation perhaps in my infancy you could learn from me what it is to be alive and naked in this world without the weight of dusty disciplines  I cannot rest in this place knowing that there are still those striving to reach the summit so although the view is wonderful and the peace is a living thing I begin to climb back down and take one last look around and feel sad for this loneliness in the oneness and half way down the summit I get the view of the community of those neither here nor there  a hand up for you. you can continue to the summit or you can offer your hand too to the ones who are arriving and striving for that mountain view I have been there and have found light there but here is where I belong  on the top of the mountain there is liberation but halfway there is grace and simple love's discovery this is what drives me this is my calling to replace your worn out shoes with new ones and to give you the support to continue your climb to the top of this mountain, and take in the view  perhaps I will falter a bit and find you standing here next to me supporting me to remind me of the view  from where I stand It's a beautiful day when you know what you are and why you are here  I take in the landscape of this middle way and find solace on this day I breath it in deeply and am brought back to this moment by the next seeker  with outstretched hand I am here for you take my hand, and may grace find you in wonder at your journey  ©2003 DC Vision

      I am in one taste on the first real day of spring when the sun  greets you like a lover and ceases mocking and holding back its embrace  when the long hibernation is over I venture out to explore the same surroundings but with the new sensual discourse of a babe  there is a long outbreath that is released and a smile spreads face wide as hope is sprung in the annual rituals of life and limb  knowing the frigid short days of winter are never more  than a stone's throw away I must commit to my memory every moment  of this grace  as I get older the first signs of spring have a deeper meaning I need this I need the promise of longer and more hopeful new beginnings   ©2003 DC Vision

      this season for me has ended I've taken my early retirement from the stage of scripted life and took a seat in the theater  all the roles that I have played rolled off my tongue with ease so comfortable as a chameleon in the vacuous appetites of my peers  we've been attracted to titillation we've been in love with background noise I had not known a moment of peace from the chatter of my own expectations  but I've grown weary of distraction and superficial sweeteners it took only a moment's hold of silence for me to stretch it into eternity  this is the song's lovely lyrics that have always escaped my mind because the words never reached beyond my moving lips to the heart  some go out like a phoenix rising some leave behind new philosophies some alter our perceptive realities and some disappear so effortlessly  I am of this moment of our time a witness to the decline of originality there is truly nothing new under the sun that hasn't been already screwed up to perfection  ©2003 DC Vision

      THE SORROW HOLE   I have arrived I say this long climb up through the darkest hours has left me empty my eyes do not open or register another dawn  the rain falls like troubles as nature cries the tears that I have been unable to and I walk to the deep woods and collapse in this sorrow hole in hopes of it drowning me  I've held the blade and the bottle of pills I've stared down the barrel and leaned over ledges I've died to myself so many times that the skeleton of my good days could find no calories to sustain itself  It is a life of lies that has kept me  distracted from my self too close to the truth and it burns my fictitious  point of reference away  I lay down in a pool of my own  unconscious making tonight either the rain or pneumonia or insanity will truly know me as the fool I really am consciousness fades...  I am alive I say one more dawn  to meet my disappointment one more day to find my way out of the sorrow hole  (For a lost friend)   ©2003 DC Vision

      dancing on the hot coals of rapid change leaves you breathless directionless and leaning heavily on the brakes  oh to be in the world and not be of it then it might be noticed how absolutely  it is a place of sensitivity and sanctuary  i want to celebrate my existence and the ecstasy satiated and underrated or over appreciated of sparked wonderment and its release  in the rhythm of Orion pacing the southern skies waking to the sensual connect of elements colliding throughout the environment  and me  and those times those precious times when i am seen and heard as the explorer i am and am trying to be we are always  one moment away  from happy from home from knowing truth from laughing out loud from being unafraid from embracing love from living large from breaking the barrier and skin of this dream  and i am here and i am now and i am awake and i am crying because the sun will rise over penobscot bay and i will be able to greet it once again  ©2003 DC Vision

      Trailblazer  is that the man that I once was who insisted on blazing new trails and not living a "what if" life?  a decade of seasons and gravity recedings have passed and I wonder where that passionate rider rode off to  these days it takes multiple attempts to kick start a heart that at one time wouldn't be tamed by words or worries  is this the fate of all trailblazers that the trails fade away to foot paths that constantly need maintaining?  it always seems  half a step away with the miles placed on this body the desire will not manifest for seeing what lies over the next horizon  perhaps too many disillusioned vistas has left my heart in comfort in place with no more adventures calling out to me  thankfully that rider never knew his fate or he might have never have set foot on that trail I'm standing on today wondering or pleading if I have one last ride left in me  ©2003 DC Vision

      Unconditional    for all the talk of love that I have been witness to it pales to what I have experienced here with you  I have been taught to be  less than zero my walls and masks  too numerous to name  so many years of not knowing myself I want to smash this lie this pattern of running from those who see me and love me or worse yet hurting them  for seeing past my defenses I nearly died inside  for those lost chances  but on this day my arsenal is laughed at ridiculed and yet I am loved not in words this time that I cannot feel but in actions  you come after me and do not run from me I am a stranger to this new type of love... unconditional  I hold onto it with all of my heart afraid of it and yet afraid to let it go  ©2003 DC Vision

      Waiting (With an Audience)   I've been lying on the railroad tracks  waiting in vain for your hyped arrival  drawing a crowd of ambulance chasers  discussing the finer points of survival   I know a whole lot of interesting people  plagued with information in their heads  who figure they hold the market on truth  sleeping within the void of empty beds   I've survived the unnoticed changes  guess I'm good at the nod and smile  sooner or later you face the enemy  I had a small role in that telecast trial   so please don't mind if I sit this one out  you bury the justice if you bury the losses  the trendsetters and trend followers alike  are making decisions in unfriendly coin tosses   now I'm standing by the road like a squirrel  gauging the odds of making it across  taking notes on the didn't-quite-make-its  trying not to lose faith pondering their loss   never thought time would be so time consuming  i need to start over and break some new ground  but it is so hard to set a lasting foundation  with pieces of your past scattered around   been too long a self-destructive concession  years of painting tragic comedies for profit  self pity and denial are too strong a drug  a price apparent when you come down off it   spiraling down slowly to this reflection of me  may be what I chose - may be what I've adjusted to  trying to be able to look myself in the eyes  and accept the product's uncertain overview   ©2003 DC Vision

      Winter In Maine  ice crystals form mosaics as the warmth inside collides with the arctic winds meeting no takers the topography becomes rigid and the pocket of the hearth is not taken for granted  for the brave winged ones and vociferous red squirrels that find seed and cracked corn left by my quick paced circle around the yard placing my blessings at every feeder and scattering the fuel over hard and pitiless soil for the mourning doves and crows to keep warm  it is on days like this when there seems no habitable  corner to make rest when the sun doesn't rise as a natural furnace all I can see is  my neighbors from the woods huddled in packs picking for scraps that I feel a responsibility for all the simple wealth that I am comforted in to share with those  who are in need  I know they watch for me every early frigid morning  making the rounds with the seed buckets I catch glimpses in the branches cautious eyes in the underbrush but within moments of returning to the comfort of my heated womb they one by one  take my offerings  winter in maine is the worst predator and even the usual tops of the food chains find humble thanks for  every little blessing  ©2004 DC Vision

      Wonder Still Manifests  in an involved street of mobile faces making their way to pedestrian destinations everything blended into a sidewalk cacophony  the patterns parted and you were set free  and approaching  our eyes locked for an eternal instant I could not breathe and I could not look away  what biographies did our minds create for each other in seconds I saw long deep nights of quiet conversations where topics don't retreat and there is comfort in closeness  the nearer we stepped  into sensual proximity our eyes widened knowing something special was taking place between us all I am left with for my part in the mystery was an enchanting smile and a fading echo of essence  we passed each other by and I did not turn for fear  that I would not see you there you are tangible and real in my day's gratitude for reminding me that  wonder still manifests  when I least expect it  ©2003 DC Vision

      Zoom  Seeing the decay of my untapped wonder frightened me worse than any fiction.  When the ambitious addictions wear off and you wake up to the decades in blur, you get a brief moment between taking another hit of the bullshit trip, or fighting the undertow, by seeing for yourself if what you are made of is the open road of change.  And I said zoom, and gave up my ghosts for the road that was paved with progressive intentions.   ©2003 DC Vision
