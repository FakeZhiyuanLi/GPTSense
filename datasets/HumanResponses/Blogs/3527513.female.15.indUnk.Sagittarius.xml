       After I saw Intolerable Cruelty I realized I wasted a whole 2 hours and something of my precious life! I mean I could have been sleeping or watching SNL...You never know!  Well that movie was retarded and I recommend nobody to watch it. I am now really bored so I will post when something interesting happens.  Ohh yeah...Has anyone noticed on the Dollywood Billboards with a girl and a guy in the front of a roller coaster...Well it looks a lot like Chase and Tara...I've noticed it a long time ago but I was never sure if it was them...hmm tell me if u know what I am talking about  Ta-Ta guys!

        Well Lately I've been watching a few movies...here are my mini-reviews....  The Terminal: I thought this movie was good until I saw the ending...It's sorta like Spiderman, the movie is really good but the ending sucks...Speaking of Spiderman I want to see Spiderman 2!!  Paycheck: Now I have to say this movie was pretty awesome. Even tho I don't like Ben Affleck because he looks...well I just don't like him.  The movie tho is really good!  Master and Commander: Lately I've been sick and tired of Chick Flicks so I decided to watch guy movies...and I guess I should not watch movies like this anymore...It SUCKED and I hated it!!  Well now I am going to watch Intolerable Cruelty... have a nice day!  Currently Listening to: Phantom Planet - All Over Again

       Anyways...The Beta Trip was just full of stories but how could I have forgotten to tell you this...  Everyone in my room cussed like a sailor...and it got to a point where we totally couldn't help it anymore.  I was at the pool and everyone was about to leave when all of a sudden Rachel tried to push Dara back into the pool...well it didn't work and Dara ended up tripping.  When she got up her and Rach were having a cat fight...then on the top of Rachel's lungs she screamed out "You mother fucker"!!  This Beta sponsor lady was about a foot away from Rachel when she said that and gave her the ugliest look ever!!  It was hillarious!  There was another time when I was in an elevator full of people and I said "shit" (on accident) and everyone stared at me all weird but I don't want to get into detail about that because it wasn't as good as Rachel's cussing story.    Well those lame dances we had to go to were actually pretty funny.  I saw Daniel A. talking to a group of eleven year old girls (I don't know if he was hitting on them or trying to get them to dance with Andrew)...Rebekah dared me to back it up on him so after about a minute of consideration I finally decided to do it.  I went right behind him and totally backed up into him.  He ended up falling and screaming "Holy Shit"...and from what I heard all the girls just ran away...ha ha!  It was some good stuff...

       I just got back from the beta trip today...It was SO much fun I didn't want to come back.    On one of the days we went shopping at some mall and we could only get there by a Subway/train thing.  Well supposedly I was walking too slow so right when I got out of the subway the door closed on everyone behind me.  Rebekah, Tiffany, Dara, Justin, and Ponder were still in the subway and it drove away!!  Good thing the guys knew to get off the subway and ride back to the last place.  Rebekah said she would have probably kept riding the subway because she thought it went in a hoop...well it doesn't, they would have made everyone get off at the end of the route...LOL...It was really funny...  We had a really good room at the hotel...the balcony had a perfect view of the pool!! ha ha...you know what I'm thinking!  Anyways we took the mattress off the rollaway bed and put it out in the balcony to camp out only in the city! It was really fun but the smog was awful...I think I saw only one star the whole trip...But other than that It was awesome!!

        I was so bored today so I decided to start a blog. At first I went to Blogeasy.com and it really sucked and looked really ugly so I wasted a ton of time on there...Thank God I found Blogspot!!  Yesterday I went to see The Day After Tomorrow.  I thought it would be stupid but its actually pretty good.  I had a pass so I wanted to use it for that movie but they werent accepting passes for it.  I ended up getting tickets for Shrek 2 and went to see The Day After.  You can get away with anything at the movies here...Good ole Hickville!!  I've had my permit FOREVER and I haven't gotten to drive yet and I was going to go today but the guy that was going to teach me is sick so I'll have to wait till next week...ohh well I still have all summer long

        I am back from the beach!!&nbsp; It was really fun.&nbsp; I went with Amanda's family and we stopped at a Braves game on the way to Florida which was pretty cool even tho I don't like baseball and we ended up losing to some Canadian team (stupid Canadians...I'm JK).&nbsp;     &nbsp;   We went to Cocoa Beach Florida!!&nbsp; Me and Amanda are Surfer chicks now...well she already knew how to surf but I learned how.&nbsp; It was SO much fun but I have bruises ALL over me.&nbsp; Well this one night some drunk guy walked by our hotel...he said something like "Hey I have been f-ing walking for about 3 f-ing miles and i need an f-ing cell phone charger so I can f-ing call someone to f-ing come pick me up."&nbsp; It was really weird and sorta freaky.&nbsp; There were a lot of other things that happened but I am too tired to continue posting so...ttyl!!     &nbsp;   Currently listening to: Dying of Silence - Phantom Planet

       I am leaving for the beach with Amanda tomorrow!!  It's going to be SO much fun...but I have to pack today =(.  I was talking to my sister and she told me her boyfriend is banned from all Wal-Mart and Sam's Club locations because when he was leaving Wally World one time he accidentally hit one of the staff members with his cart.  That staff guy reported it to the police and said that he did it on purpose.  Why would anyone hit you on purpose?  Maybe that guy was high...you never know...  But I'd have to say being banned from Wal-Mart is pretty funny!  I think I might go see Anchorman today...I dunno...

        I go to the beach in 5 days!!  I'm really excited but time is passing really slow for me right now because I'm waiting...that sucks...But since I am doing nothing I will tell you a bit about whats going on.  I've been working this summer at Nummwaan and my sister has been out of town so I have to fill in for her too!! (it sucks) Well yesterday I got tea ALL over my pants and shoes...and that's how a typical work day is like for me! Fun Fun!  The other day I was talking to Justin Josh and Ponder in some chat and somehow we started to talk about hot guys and it was really interesting what the guys had to say about other guys.  I think Ponder and me have the same taste in guys.  We talked about...  Mel Gibson: Justin thought he was hot. I think it's great that he did the Passion but he's too old. Johnny Depp: Once again Justin thought he was hot. Me and Ponder think he looks good only in Pirates of the Caribbean. Orlando Bloom: My favorite Ashton Kutcher: I think Josh brought him up and I'd have to say he's pretty FINE... Kurt Thomas: You were the only not-famous person that we talked about.  I'd feel lucky if I was you to have so many guys think you are attractive...lol  There was probably some other people we talked about but I don't remember...If you are a guy and would like to add to the list of hot guys go ahead leave it in the comments.  I think I myself will add Chase to the list right now...  Currently Listening to: Taking Back Sunday - Timberwolves at New Jersey

       I finally went driving the other day for the first time...and I've had my permit for almost 6 months!!  I was nervous when I first got in the car and when I was moving the stick to "drive" i accidentally turned the windshield wipers on also and when that happened I was going to turn it off but I forgot to hold on the the brake!!  Good thing no other cars were on the road...after a while I got the hang of it and I was doing okay although I almost went into a ditch (but I didn't).  So after about 30 minutes of driving I was going down some road behind the Ford place and I saw a mailbox that had PONDER on it.  I was thinkin it's Daniels house and I remembered when he said he lived back there...with that train of thought I forgot I was driving!!  Good thing I only barely went off the road...I need to pay attention to what I do more often.  Well that was only the first time I drove so don't worry I will get better...  I miss everybody SO much!!  Happy 4th!!

       Well here I am.  I have been bored to death lately.  But this beats working!!  I would have to say that I see a lot of things there and most of the time I really don't want to see it.  Ex: some skanky girl that would NOT STOP pushing up her boobs, at least 3 thongs (It was gross), but once in a while if I get lucky I see a gorgeous guy.  Umm I don't think I have gotten hit on by any very old guys lately so that's a good thing!!  Well school starts in 6 days...I can't believe summer is almost over!!  Ohh well I just need to quit complaining.  I am finally going to get a cellphone!!  (woo hoo!)  Now I am thinking about the MP3 player now...I have the money for it but I am paranoid that once I buy it a better one will come out.  So should I buy it or not?? I am so indecisive!!  I have been rambling the whole time...sorry if I bored you.  Buh Bye!!      Currently Listening To:  Relient K - Falling Out

       Gosh my blog is really screwed up so I am going to recopy my last post....hopefully it'll show up this time.        Well the other day I had a dream that I died!! How freaky...Dara told me that if you have a dream that you died it means you are pregnant....hmmm....Maybe I'm pregnant. I was in an elevator packed with little kids and they would not stop getting in the doorway when it was closing so the elevator doors kept closing half way and then opening again. Everytime it did that the elevator would shake (it was some crappy elevator) and when it finally closed completely the little kids kept jumping up and down. All of a sudden the lights go off and the elevator cable somehow got broken and I am falling down to the ground from the 20th floor. I remember I was in the elevator with 3 other friends and Rachel P. was one of them that died with me...I can't think of the other 2. But anywhoo when I hit the bottom of the building movie credits popped up. It was really weird...but I guess I am pregnant now!

Since it closed my dad had to move EVERYTHING to the house so I have a huge stove sitting out in my yard and we have a big walk in fridge in the basement.       Well I have been bored a lot lately. Check this out  urlLink http://lifeisajoke.com/pictures234_html.htm  I think I want one of these signs to put in front of my house...lol I'm jk. Anyways I can't believe school starts in 14 days...I think what you guys should do is buy me something in the 2 weeks time...here is my wish list:      1. mp3 player   2.

       I hate posting but I guess I will do it anyways.  School starts in about 2 weeks...that's crazy our summer break is SO short.  Ohh well I miss everybody so I guess it won't be a bad thing getting to see all my friends.      Last night my sister highlighted my hair for me.  It took her 2 hours to put the highlights in my hair and I had to wait about 45 minutes for it to dry and then i had to shower so I didn't get done until 3 in the morning.  (now doesn't that sound fun!!)  Well at least my hair looks cool now.  The highlights are actually brighter on the left side of my head because my sister started there...so its bright on the left side and normal on the right i guess...i dunno...enough about my hair.      I went driving again.  I have a few problems:    Staying on the right side of the road   Stopping at stop signs.      But other than that I think I'm good. LOL.  I am probably going to see The Village soon even though Ponder told me the ending but ohh well it's okay Ponder.
