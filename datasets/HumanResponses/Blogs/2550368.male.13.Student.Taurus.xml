Im not going to use this host for 13 because I like hosting the site in house. :)  2: Weeeeeeeelllllll: P4 (2.6ghz) (SMT (Hyper-Threading)) P4 Motherboard D[Something]PERL (6 channel audio, lan (gigabit?), SATA, SMT, 800MHZ FSB!!) Full sized punching bag ThinkGeek 'Best Of' Caffine Sampler (Link) Linux Boxers ThinkGeek LED Binary Clock (Link) [BLUE] $160 (100 of it in ones!!)

You can cut a chicken's head off and it will keep on running and twitching  [CHORUS] When everything seems planned out when everything seems nicely planned out well the human race will come and smack your face  How come all my body parts so nicely fit together? All my organs doing their jobs, no help from me! A person pulls a spider's leg out To watch it keep on moving and twitching.  Satan lives here: on grain and earth, rain and air.  How come I just smoke and smoke and smoke  and curse every butt I spit out?

      Is this the real life- Is this just fantasy- Caught in a landslide- No escape from reality- Open your eyes Look up to the skies and see- I’m just a poor boy,i need no sympathy- Because I’m easy come,easy go, A little high,little low, Anyway the wind blows,doesn’t really matter to me, To me  Mama,just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, Pulled my trigger,now he’s dead, Mama,life had just begun, But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away- Mama ooo, Didn’t mean to make you cry- If I’m not back again this time tomorrow- Carry on,carry on,as if nothing really matters-  Too late,my time has come, Sends shivers down my spine- Body’s aching all the time, Goodbye everybody-I’ve got to go- Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth- Mama ooo- (any way the wind blows) I don’t want to die, I sometimes wish I’d never been born at all-  I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouche,scaramouche will you do the fandango- Thunderbolt and lightning-very very frightening me- Galileo,galileo, Galileo galileo Galileo figaro-magnifico- But I’m just a poor boy and nobody loves me- He’s just a poor boy from a poor family- Spare him his life from this monstrosity- Easy come easy go-,will you let me go- Bismillah! no-,we will not let you go-let him go- Bismillah! we will not let you go-let him go Bismillah! we will not let you go-let me go Will not let you go-let me go Will not let you go let me go No,no,no,no,no,no,no- Mama mia,mama mia,mama mia let me go- Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me,for me,for me-  So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye- So you think you can love me and leave me to die- Oh baby-can’t do this to me baby- Just gotta get out-just gotta get right outta here-  Nothing really matters, Anyone can see, Nothing really matters-,nothing really matters to me,  Any way the wind blows.... - Queen  Some  urlLink good tunes , some corn pops, nice cup of coffee, and of corce a good heaping of  urlLink slashdot .  Intresting thing of today: When I run the distributed.net client with 1 thread it runs at around 3,200,000 keys per second but with 2 threads it runs arround 1,700,000 keys per second.. its not like im running on a system with one CPU!

      This article is what i'd like to call "The 1 man army grows to an empire" Jeffsworld.net is now expanding.. how so? More domains! I just ordered Jeffsworld.BIZ and it should be online soon. I think im going to use it for the Main Network site kida think..ya know? I also backordered jeffsworld.com.. you know what that means? Once jeffsworld.com is avalible for buying (like the second is avalible) it will be registred under my name and then we will rule!  HERES WHAT MAKES ME MAD: Jeffsworld.Com expired in nov. BUT evrey time I tryed to register it I was told that it was unavalible. Most whois servers said that the domain had no entry. Some whois servers showed the old news that it expired NOV 2003. Just six days ago (Jan 21) Jeffsworld.Com was registred to some lamer who buys lots of domains and puts a search page up. THAT MAKES ME MAD! UHG!!  Heres a little bit of other jeffsworlds: Jeffsworld.Org - Now this site hasn't been updated in a while (2000) but at least his name is jeff! Jeffsworld.US - Looks like someone's a n00b and didn't put up a site!  Oh PS: I made the  urlLink Jeffsworld Network Status Blog , its got news about the site/network/servers.

      This morning I was reading some other blogs at xanga (well just  urlLink mary's ) and I relized that I like that "Currently Playing" thing. I also would like to code a "Current Mood" script with smiley faces and such. Heres the two ways I could do it: 1. With evrey post add &lt;? $currently_playing = "Crash Test Dummies - Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm"; $current_mood = "extreamly_tired"; &gt; and have the script print it out (including a simley face that goes with the mood) at the bottom. 2. Finaly move my blog to jeffsworld.biz (or .net) COMPLETELY! Note: At the moment it is just hosted at jeffsworld.net and I am using blogger.com for posting/editing the template. When I make a post it uploads all of the files via ftp.  TODAYS PROJECTS: 1. Install FreeBSD 4.9 on a Intel D865PERL motherboard with hyper-threading (SMT) AND an ATI Radeon 9600XT (I need to have 3d exeleration/hyper-threading suport)* 2. Write the smiley script/Mood script  OR  write my own blog  OR  mod the script im using for the network blog. 3. Get something to eat! (Im hungry)  Latter lamers, Jeff  * I know.. i know.. the OS dosen't need SMT support only SMP support. Auctly I don't think there is SMT support in any OS. UH OH! That gives me an idea.. hyper-threading (SMT) GFX cards.. for like multi-monitor's. Or SMT chipsets and stuff! What a good idea! Now intel's gona steal it.. waahhhhh

      I don't like it. Not one bit. Blogger has changed there interface for the publishing. I do not like it. Not one bit.  Here's a list of problems with this (with firefox): 1. The "View Blog" thing is mucked up 2. When I change the size of the top frame the posting area rezises ONLY when I make it bigger.. not when I make it smaller. 3. It  blows.  I just got back from the slopes. I had a good time but ehg some people realy suck. This kid I was with lost his ski getting on the lift __3__ times.. ok it was my doing the last time but he lost it by himself twice. We ski'ed (acutly he sik'ed and I snowboardededd) untill the end of time time (Hey I paid my money i'll not be screwed).  So y'all see the news about MS Source Code leaked? (Win2k/NT).. yea I got a copy.. ohh I mean I would never get a copy thats so against the law. The only code i'v glanced at is the code for MSHTML. It's quite intresting.  I think im starting to like using this notebook instead of my desktop but it is slower! (Need iBook or PowerBook.. waahhhh), Jeff

      Closing Link: PirateMee by Panamacity.PA.Undernet.Org (K-lined) --- ERROR: ERROR Closing Link: PirateMee by Panamacity.PA.Undernet.Org (K-lined)  hmm /me wonders what did I do? When did I get myself banned fro undernet? Strange. By the way I mucked up my windows xp installation with Sun Solaris (x86 version) so i'm working with an oldwer IBM T23 laptop... :-/. I tryed to fix it but repair didn't work so I reinstalled. My network card didn't work (it is a new gigabit card.) and of corce you cant just DOWNLOAD THE DRIVERS IF YOU HAVE NO NETWORKING so I had to burn it onto a cd. Durring my installation there was a few problems copying a few dlls like for the MMC and stuff so I tried installing XP SP 1 but oddly it didn't get updated.. waahhh. To bad I dont have one of those niiiiice powerbooks or ibooks with firewire because I could just do a little internet connection sharing.. who would need a gigabit card! uhgy!  I want a mac. - Jeff

      These are great directions:   1st number. Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on. 1: The handle part (the part that springs open when you get the combination), pull on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move. 2: While pulling on it turn the knob to the left until it won't move any more. Then add 5 to this number. Congradulations, you now have the 1st number.  2nd number. (a lot tougher) Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the 1st number once. WHEN you have bypassed. Start pulling the handle and turning it. It will eventually fall into the groove and lock. While in the groove pull on it and turn the knob. If it is loose go to the next groove; if it's stiff you got the second number.  3rd number: After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2 numbers, then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on it. The lock will eventually open if you did it right. If can't do it the first time, be patient, it takes time.    Boy am I going to have fun at school :), Oh btw im going to shooters cabin. Be back tomarow.  - Jeff

      Today I was looking at the leaked windows 2000 source code (OPS! No I wasn't!) and I thought..: "If evreything was opensource how the hell would people make money?" At this point I decided: "Screw Open Source software deployment as a job. I'd rather make good money codin' for microsoft" Ya know some of this code is reeeeeeeeeeeeeaaally good. Impresive stuff. Other code is just freakin' stupid. The hack apon hack (There are so many comments saying: // *HORIBLE, BAD HACK*) Heres one of my fav. quotes:  File: private\windows\media\avi\verinfo.16\verinfo.h:       *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      * !!!!!!!IF YOU CHANGE TABS TO SPACES, YOU WILL BE KILLED!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!DOING SO FUCKS THE BUILD PROCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Ok last night I spent hours getting visual studio .net re installed then trying to compile giFT well I found out it was a complete wast. KCeasy rules it is by far the best giFT front end. Think of it like its its just like KazaaLite (no adds or spyware) but it suports more networks. It works with OpenFT, Gnutella, and FastTrack (Kazaa) So get it from  urlLink there site .  A freind is taking me skiing in about 30mins (9 o'clock) so ill check back in latter eh? Ok.  - Jeff

      POOPER POLICE  Judges declare war on pet owners  Friday, April 16, 2004 Posted: 6:35 PM EDT (2235 GMT)  AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) -- Two Texas judges have made a federal case out of dog poop on the courthouse lawn.  Irked by a profusion of pet excrement on the small lawn of the federal courthouse in downtown Austin, U.S. District Judges Sam Sparks and Lee Yeakel issued an order on Thursday:  "Any person who authorizes or permits any animal to relieve itself on the grass or grounds of the United States Courthouse shall be subject to citation, fine, and/or arrest effective from this date...  "Too many individuals had permitted their pets to relieve themselves on the grass and grounds," the order said.  The courthouse neighbors a ritzy loft development, and the dog owners who live there are the apparent targets of the order.  The courthouse has the only grass in the immediate area.  ---  LOL! Oh and have a nice LAN

      Wow. Today was strange.. some how I got the solo for the song "Fame" (No not the kewl david bowie song). It's strange because I totaly SUCKED when I tryed out but I guess she knows I can do better :) Well I hung out with Nape at the REC today and shot some baskets till my mom came and got us. I got home and played a very little amount of counter-strike then I had dinner, shot my paint ball gun (Real fun I was running and shooting at trees :) ), cut the grass (I love to cut the grass :) ) and now im going to play counter-strike for an hour and go to bed.

      I HAVE BEEN DRIVING OVER THE F*CKING TOP TODAY. They changed counter-strike a few days ago.. big deal you might think... YES ITS A HUGE DEAL the crosshairs are fucking huge and it is impossible to aim! What are they trying to do make us people with 1600x1200 res on 21'' montiors suffer? HOW AM I GOING TO WIN MY MATCH TOMAROW? THATS RIHGT THEY CHANGE CS 2 DAYS BEFORE MY FIRST EVER MATCH IN A LEAGUE.  I use to love steam.. sure the semi-constant crashing was bad and the "Game currently unavalible" problem sucked at the error about the service not being started was bad but this has drivin me off the top. VALVE IF YOU GUYS KEEP CHANGING COUNTER-STRIKE MORE I AM F*CKING UNINSTALLING COUNTER-STRIKE AND PLAYING A REAL GAME LIKE Unreal Turnoment 2004 (Hehe a real game like unreal).  Ok my weekend: Lan/Birthday party on friday (Got over $100). Slept at 1:30PM Woke up at 11PM Slept at 2AM Woke up at 8AM  I went to best buy today and baught a logitech MX510 for better acuracy in counter-strike ($50) BUT NOW I GUESS IT WONT MATTER.  UHG. Im gona go play cs and kill people to take out my angure.

      GIMME THE MIKE  Better dust it off first....ahem. So it's summer, school's out and the blog is as empty as the school. So where's Jeff? In bed sick. Yeah...waits until now to get a cold. Go figure.  He installed FreeBSD 5.2.1...has been building forts for a two-day paintball war coming up in a month or so...may be joining the scouts to have some campout fun...is going to be a mallrat this weekend...and had a close encounter with a lovely lady named poison ivy.  And, Blogger seems to have changed their interface (again), Apple released AirTunes (my son and I are both getting one), and I'm moving. So...the blog will probably continue to be quiet.  Email Jeff all your chicken soup and maybe we'll see him when he's up to snuff again.

      Well hey losers and bored people, Im back now because well I am finaly not to sick! wooohooo! *Jeff dances around the HTML block* I felt like total crap for a while. &nbsp; Before I went to Mikey Z's on Monday I started freezing and went under a down blanket (still freezing) and feeling like I was going to puke. I was fine soon and went to rinky dink.  Later at his house I kept having the same problem. This happend a lot in the morining and I started getting a horible sore throat. Kept happining through the afternoon and I felt more like I was going to puke. Now I was feeling fine but with sore throat so I had Mikey Z and Matt M for a LAN. I started feeling sick and only played an hours worth then went to bed.  &nbsp; The next mornining I woke up at like 7 AM and drank coffee feeling reeeaally bad. I sujested the doctors and my Mom called me in. Thankfuly we got in right when they opened and got out within an half hour. When I got back Mikey and Matt where in bed so I played counter-strike and they woke up.  &nbsp; That same day I felt very bad all day but today I am totaly fine! My only problem is this freaking snot and in the first half a bit of a sore throat (now I am basicly fine). &nbsp; So thats that, - Jeff

      I just got back from Rinky Dink. I went go carting (3 rounds) the first round I had the best car but then I got screwd the second two but I made the most of it by going out far enuf to let a car pass by me but then right before they came to my rear I would swerv realy fast closing off there way to pass me and they would slow down. I also went mini-golfing and we bloth sucked. It was so hot out we only did like 1 and a forth. Then we played video games ($4 worth). We did r0x0r at the game we played. Then we went in the batting cadges and he r0x0red and I sux0r3d. Now I am at Mikey Z's house and I am spending the night.  PS: I made a nice template today but I cant upload the images untill I install Office XP so I can read my old email with my password in it. *UHG*  Lates, Jeff

       urlLink    Click link for more information.  So anyway today (well yesterday) I sold pcinic tables for Boy Scouts. Didn't get any sales but the canadian lady said that they don't usual get sales at are location. It was cool because I get 7 untaxed and hour into my account which pays for summer camp/high adventure/hats/etc.. I also got a chance to do some coding. Iv been messing with KiXtart2001 latley. It's reaaally cool. Free. Nice. and such :). Im currently working on a script for lan partys that you can run and it installs steam, installs steam skin, installs mcafee virus scanner, and installs spybot. Ntoe that it doesn't install whats not needed to be installed and also it runs a full virus scan/updates dats/checks for spyware automaticly.. well it will. Currently it just checks and installs for steam and a skin I made for it.  A little bit ago I did some more work on my project psPortal. I don't quite remember what ps standed for but im sure its something about poop in stance. Most of the stuff im doing right now is just brainstorming for ideas for things like skinning system, etc.. The DBD (database drivers) are very plain but they should work (I wrote a mysql dbd and a postgresql dbd). I belive I have something going with my INI style skinning system but it is going to take a lot of coding!  Another thing I noticed today is PHPEDIT COSTS MONEY!! I didn't belive it but I saw it prompt me when I installed it on my computer. So while looking for a "way around" registration I stumbled apon a few "way around" registration for PhpED and it made me thing "Hmmmmm Zend Studio blows, PHPEdit now blows, Pico blows, xEmacs sortof blows, maby this one doesn't blow" so I downloaded a trail and yes it is the r0x0r! It is so much more stable then Zend and is not FREAKING JAVA (I HATE JAVA) so theres a plus right there. It comes with lots of documentation and the editor area is very nice. The CVS intergration IS SOOOOOOOOO NICE!! I regret ever learning comandline CVS now that I can just right click on the file and do updates, commits, edit locks, you name it (and it has to do with CVS) and PhpED does it! If I had the cash I would buy it!  Tomarow (Well today) Mike Z and maby Matt and I decided to go to rinky dink (batting cadges, go carts, mini gold, etc..) so we should have a tits time and I will most likley walk away with a few more colored golf balls :)  Screw y'all, Jeff
