        I was a little surprised in two ways by this film.  First, it's opening weekend take being in the $38M range.  I thought AVP would debut at #2 at best.  Hell, it nearly out did the #2 and #3 movies for the weekend!  Secondly (and this goes hand -in-hand with the first), it was a little better than I anticipated.  Don't get me wrong, it still had at least two REALLY cheesey scenes.  I had been eagerly anticipating this movie since I first heard about it over a year ago, so I defied my general rule and saw it during the opening weekend (I generally wait at least one week to see a movie in an attempt to avoid some of the crowds).  The action was pretty good and not out this world impossible (like Charlie's Angels 2), the dialogue was decent for a movie of this genre and the actors were a pretty good choice.  My only complaint regarding actors would be that of the female lead, Sanaa Lathan.  I don't think that it's because I don't like her so much as she doesn't seem to fit the role of an action movie.  I did like the touch of bringing Lance Henriksen in on the project.  For one thing, I just like his rough voice, but also for series nostalgia.  They had a quick shot of him that relates to a prior movie.  They had a cople of nice nods to the prior movies for anyone that would notice.           SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT RISK OF YOUR OWN ENJOYMENT           One disappointment I had was that the Predators got their butts handed to them on a  pretty little decorative platnium platter.  I mean come on, the first one to go down didn't even see it coming.  Oh well, perhaps it was meant to be a bit of a surprise since most people seemed to think that Predators would mop the floor with the Aliens.  I thought the only real strength the Aliens would have over their nemisis would be strength in numbers.  Who knew they are as cunning as the Predators?  I did really like the long fight scene with the last P.  I  enjoyed how he just toyed with it at first but quickly realized that he was losing ground, and nearly his life.          Any thoughts?  I purposefully left much out to leave room for discussion (and I'm just tired of typing for the moment).

        Since I am just starting out with this, my postings will be a bit of a hodge-podge of movies, and in no particular order. I will probably just start with the mostly recently seen movie and go onto new movies seen mixed with prior movies.
