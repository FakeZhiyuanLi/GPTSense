      Hey Guys!!!  I tell ya this weekend has been a good one! okay... Friday: Philip was comming over so we could work on our project ( rhetoric UGH!!!)... he was spending the night and we were all excited about procrastinating on our rhetoric thingy because we hate it so much! (ad baculum- its a philip thing) and so we're at school till like 5:30 cuss my mom has all these meetings and stuff but lucky for us HANNAH AND LAUREN WERE THERE!!!! yay!!!! ( lauren  I DIDNT BREAK YOUR BRACLET!!HANNAH LIES!!!!-inside thing again...) they were working on their project too! so hannah and casey (ahem!-for you hannah) taught us how to play poker and we got adicted soo fast!!! so we stopped and had chineese on the way home (kinda) and then we played more poker then worked on our project till my mom told us to to stop...(never bin so releaved!) k so get this its like 11:30  philip and i have chocolat milk and cold coffee stuff and were already dead tired so you can imagine how funny every thing was and boy was it funny! we sat up in the top bunk of my bed and we played poker till 1:30 (it stunk i got one good hand the whole time) and we couldnt stop laughing! i wont go into detail to spare the imbaresment but it was great...k then Sat: after begging with philip's parents  we get him to stay till 1:00! (they wanted to take him home to work on other junk) wich me being my selfish self said that stinks we cant do anything with hannah now... (she lives like down the street...)and we were gonna go to the mall with her but well obviously that fell through... so after a million tries we decide we have enough time to do something at hannah's house and we both had permission from our parents to do it. so hannah's WONDERFUL mom works out her schedule to fit ours and says she'll go grocery shopping while we hang out at her house instead of leaving to do her shopping... so we're all excited that we can do something then i realize there wont be any adults there (big nono to my mom) THE WHOLE THING FELL THROUGH!!! we were so depressed!! we werent gonna lie to our parents so we were gonna be stuck at home... poop!!!!! untill Hannah's wonderful mom sais: k i'll stay home and clean so you guys can have fun... HANNAH I LOVE YOUR MOM YAY!!!!!! oh and if that doesnt top it of... she comes and picks us up to instead of a us walking aint she great?!?!?! it was so nice! so when we get there you guys guess what we did... POKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yay!!! i swear in a couple hours i am gonna suffer from gambling withdrawl! but thats okay lets just hope it doesnt happen in youth group cuss thats were I'm goin now! Well pray for me guys!!!! lol i'll catch you later ttfn!!!  Quote of the day: " hannah i dint steal your quote of the day thing!!!!!" -a stright out lie from yours truly!  Lyric of the day: "so kiss me...."
