      I like Australians. I really do. In fact Mother is Australian and Sister and I have dual nationality. We go and visit as often as we can and I have tons of relatives there. Just making clear that I'm not racist before I go on.  My problem isn't with Australians in general. Or even with Australians who live in the UK. In fact I welcome foreigners into the UK - I'm the kind of person that would get rid of national borders and allow everyone to live in peace and harmony in one big global commune.  My problem is with Australians who come half way round the world to live here and then moan about it. Here's a typical example of a conversation I overheard on the train last week going to work from Wimbledon (where you can't move for Aussies, Kiwis and South Africans. They even have queues (QUEUES! Sweet Jesus) to get into the Walkabout on the Broadway, but more on that in another post)  Monday morning. A woman (early thirties, as they always are, dressed quite smartly. Looking like she worked in PR or perhaps the city) is on her mobile, copy of a Maeve Binchy or some such crappy fem lit hanging out of her bag. I'm squashed up against the glass banging my head against the door with every jolt of the train because she is leaning against the pole, preventing anyone else from holding on. Her "I know.....I know....I know....I fucking hate Wimbledon too. It's full of fucking retards who just want to drink all weekend." Given that she, I and the 10 people surrounding us have just got on the train at Wimbledon we all take exception to this, and an instant dislike to her. The train jolts to a stop between Earlsfield and Clapham Junction, like it does every morning. "Oh jeez. Now the train's fucking stopped. Honestly they have the worst fucking train system in this country. I'm going to be fucking late again". Australians really can't think of any superlative adjective that isn't "fucking".  It's raining hard and everyone is hot and wet, so there's quite a wet smell in the carriage, which she moans about. We sit in our own stench for about 5 minutes, all the while she is agreeing with some arsehole on the end of the line about how awful the weather in Britain is, how much her dress cost her at the weekend, how spineless her boss is and generally how much she hates the UK. Everyone else is getting increasingly annoyed at her slagging off the country that we love.   Well not quite. In fact I'd probably agree with the Aussie woman. She's right that the weather in the UK is awful, that the trains (especially SouthBastardWest) are terrible, that the NHS is still pretty bad (you have to have a leg half-hanging off in order to get an appointment at my GP's) etc etc. But I accept my lot in life - I live here because I was born here - I'd feel a bit odd going and living somewhere else. But this woman chose to come here, leaving behind her country with an easy way of life, a cheap standard of living, great weather, friendly people etc. She gave up all that to come here, recognises our country's many failings and STILL FUCKING LIVES HERE!   If the UK is so bad, why don't you go home and moan about it somewhere where you can't drag us down with you?

      I'm not the tallest of guys (5ft8, which , as I keep telling my 6ft boyfriend is average height for the British man...)  and women's hands are usually about my crotch height. This is not a good thing.   Picture this: I am striding quickly and purposefully down the passageway between Vauxhall overland station and the Victoria line. The passageway is packed and there people directly behind me and to each side. In front is a bitch-queen - blonde hair in a pony tail, pointy boots, pink pashmina, shiny black handbag, probably works in PR. She too is walking purposefully and swinging her left arm behind her as far as it will go on each stride. I am keeping away from this bitch-queen, not least because I am aware what is about to happen and am holding back slightly, giving her swinging arm the space it needs. Suddenly I notice a frisson of irritation rush through the crowd - I am attracting moral disapprobation because I am not making the best use of the space and practically bumming her, as is happening to me and everyone else in the crowd.   I am subtly pushed forward. I sense, rather than see her arm swing downwards. It continues it's downward swing and I, in anticipation of the pain that is about to ensue see if there is any way to avoid it.  I look nervously to the right - metal barrier, no where to go.  Left - a tall man with a briefcase and no space between him and the identical man in font and behind. It's inevitable. Her hand comes down and back. I twist away in the hope that I can somehow avoid it.   But no, she still hits me in the left bollock and I fall to the ground howling with pain.  jesus fucking christ.   What fucks you off?

      Teenagers are probably the most prolific offenders here, although curiously I don't mind that so much - teenagers are supposed to be rude and uncaring aren't they? The really awful ones are city boys who lean against the only pole in the middle of the tube carriage, just so they can read the FinancialFuckingTimes with both hands. Everyone else will be staggering with every jolt of the train, but as long as Mr City Boy has something solid to rest against while he reads about how to screw the rest of us out of our pension funds, he's ok.  The sheer arrogance of these people is breathtaking - why is he and his reading material so important than the comfort and safety of the rest of us? There's only one way to teach people like this a lesson. I usually grab on to the pole during the next lurch, when there is the slightest sliver of space for me to thrust my fingers in. He of course still continues to lean against the pole and against my fingers, even though I have subtly suggested that there might be someone else who needs to make use of the support.  He, of course is far more important than me and doesn't have to pick up on subtle hints like that. SO next time there's a big jolt and he lurches away from the pole, I stick two fingers out - he falls back  not onto the safety of the pole, but onto my index and middle finger jabbing him in the kidneys. He gives a yelp of surprise and looks round to find me fixing him with beady glare. He usually moves way from the pole then.  What fucks you off? Tell me - tony@ohforgodssake.co.uk

      These people will often get off a crowded escalator and stand still, trying to figure out which way to go, meaning that you have to back-pedal while telling them to get out of the way and simultaneously trying not to stand on the feet of the people behind you. They can also pull this trick just after they've gone through the ticket barrier too, meaning that you get trapped in the pincer-like steel grip of the gate. Worse is when you only realise they are a stupid monkey with no sense of personal space after you've already swiped your Oyster card. You miss your chance to get through the gate because she's (and it usually is a woman, who insists on putting her oyster card in her bag right away because otherwise she'll drop it) still standing in the way and no matter how many times you swipe again, the barrier still flashes the demonic "seek assistance". Then you have to go and ask the Tube worker if they'll let you through the gate, because some stupid fucking woman is in the way.  There are of course other examples - the guy who slows down on the busy steps merely to put their headphones on, the woman who throws her pashmina over her shoulder so hard and with so little awareness of its length that it hits me in the face and makes me sneeze (I sneezed over her back for vengeance though), the person who decides that actually he would like to get off the escalator now please, even though he's already halfway down it etc etc  These people seem completely unaware that they are disrupting the smooth running flow of traffic for everyone, that they are adding, even if in only a tiny way to the horridness of my commute. Why? Why don't they pay attention to things like this - everyone else manages to try and ease the communal misery in small ways, why can't they?  The crowning glory is when these events are preceded by the commuter in question only realising that she might need to get her ticket out just before she gets to the barrier. She then stops right in front of you and fumbles around in her shoulder bag for a bit, looking for her card, before going through the barrier, stopping and fumbling around for a bit meaning you get caught by the gate...etc  Oh god I wish they would die.

      Where do I start?  The photgraphs that come in a large envelope saying "don't bend" that are folded in half to be shoved though the letter box?  Or  The fact that in order to pick up a parcel you have to walk about 4 miles to the other side of the borough on a Saturday morning (because they aren't open in the afternoons or on Sundays of course), to be told that "a water bill doesn't count as ID".  Or  The fact that as part of a recent cost cutting exericse they said they would be scrapping the "first post". What is this second post? I've only ever experienced (in my entire 25 years of life) 1 post a day at about midday. Cheeky twunts.  Or  The fact that last week, when I was expecting a special delivery item, I came home from work to find a card saying "we tried to deliver a special delivery item at 11:30 today. We could not deliver it because this item requires a signature and no one was available". Well OF COURSE no one was fucking available you cunts - you tried to deliver it at 1130 in the morning, when everyone who contributes to the economy has been at work for three hours already.  I was off sick once and got a card pushed through the door for a recorded item. Excited as I was at something to relive the tedium of my morning (which had been spent mostly wanking and watching Trisha (not related by the way - I'm of the Bel Ami persuasion if you get what I mean) I ran to open the door and saw the postman scurrying down the garden path, obviously scared at the fact that someone was actually in during the day. Having asked him if the doorbell was broken as I hadn't heard him ringing he said "no, it's just that I don't usually bring any parcels out with me - they're too heavy". Cheeky cunt expected me to go to the delivery office myself.   What fucks you off? Tell me - tony@ohforgodssake.co.uk
