      Went to my grandma's house today swam in the pool! Always fun. My face got pretty sunburned but oh well what can ya do? We picked my cousin Jayce up on the way out to my grandma's so that was fun haven't seen her in a long while. I practiced for my Deep water upgrade (which is tomorrow) in the pool. I found a brick and treaded water with it for as long as i could, i think about a min or 2. Then i practiced my laps (not hard at all) and then my cousin Katy came back with my grandma from the beach and she helped me practice gave me a few pointers, helped me out a little. Then i layed around for a while worked on my tan for a bit, went back in the pool and played toothpaste with the little bros and cousin. Fun Fun Fun. Swimming is fun except now my eyes are like freakin burning. Had a good day, I'll write some more later tonight. SUMMERLAND tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Worked at Splish Splash today!!! It wasn't supposed to work but I figured I'd go in instead of studying for my math regents. They were happy to have me at work because they were under staffed. There were a lot of people there today not surprising though cause it was really hot! I got soooo SUNBURNED. Ouch!! My arms and back and face are all really red and sore!!! But oh well I love the job so I can't complain. They threw us a pizza party after work because we are just plain amazing! No really it was for helping them out and being really good at work all day despite the long rotations. My rotation was literally 1 hour and 45 min long!!!!!!!!!! Talk about BORING same spot for that long, the water never really does anything (haha) but oh well! I am gunna go call Jess, then watch Summerland (best show) maybe I'll be on later!!

      Yes well I must admit that HOBY is 100 times better than being in school. Today was my Bio final it was pretty easy, I think I did really well. I have a Math Regents Wednesday, Global Regents Thursday, Bio Regents Friday and a Spanish Regents Tuesday. Oh what a week! Hopefully I'll do good on all of them!   I am going to inservice at Splish Splash tonight, that should be fun... Lifeguarding is a blast, I love the people, place, and job in general. The people at Splish Splash are the GREATEST, sort of like the HOBY people but the lifeguards don't cheer as much!   Talked to Courtney on the phone and Oh Boy did she FREAK out when I told her something. Hahaha. Courtney is the only one to know about my HOBY secret... Courtney and I when ever we talk on the phone the phone alwasy seems to go dead. Haven't talked to Jess yet, but I probably should to let her know stuff!   I took a nice loooooong nap today which felt SOOO good. I slept from 2:00-5:00. Now I probably wont be able to get to sleep tonight but thats alright, I guess I can jsut watch some TV or a movie in my room until I fall asleep.  Well I am going to go, and talk to some people online, I might post later tonight but deff. tomorrow!   Love, Mel

      I got a letter from Mike Nash today (group P's JC [Junior Counslor]) and Kara (group P's Facilitator) and it just made me miss everyone even more. This is what Mike wrote to each of us and it is SO true:  This weekend was a blast and with so many things going through my head I forgot one thing.  I never had the right situation to let all of you know you are amazing people.  Read that sentence again.  Stop.  Think about it.  Read it again.  I wish I could have shed more light on situations but I was not supposed to because this weekend was for you, but if you ever have any conversations you want to take up with me about anything, I'm all for it.  On a more personal note:   Kara -  this weekend was started with you.  You raised the bar high for the team and everyone willingly stepped up.  Chloe-  your insights this weekend added a lot to discussions. Thanks  Melissa-  you overcame your timidness and now shine and have no fear.  Thanks  Steven-  wearing that shirt Sat. night proved your individuality.  Thanks  Lindsey-  talkative, talkative, talkative.  You were able to initiate others in the conversations.  Thanks  Veronica-  you know how to make decisions.  To know you want to be involved in creative writing already shows determination.  Thanks  Jordan-  Hey, you look like....Yes you are that guy because people want to be attached to you because of some quality you have.  You need to find it and exploit it. Thanks  Chris-  the pivot man of the group.  From your jokes to your serious thoughts, all of your statements were unique.  There is none in comparison.  Next time you travel send me a postcard. Thanks  I love all of you. Aww how Nice of you Mike or aka Nash! Well HOBY was amazing! But now I am back to real life.  Had my Bio final today, it was pretty easy, I think I did really well. Talked to Courtney on the phone and Oh Boy did she FREAK out when I told her something. Hahaha. I have a Math Regents Wednesday, Global Regents Thursday, Bio Regents Friday and a Spanish Regents Tuesday. Oh what a week! Hopefully I'll do good on all of them! Ok I think I am going to go take a nap on the couch. I'll write more later about my finals and regents and stuff. Love and Peace to all!!!  Love Ya, Liss

They took the head And all was red And now they're dead... Because of the sharks!  Repeat Chorus   There are a couple more cheers but I figured that this was enough for now. But as you can tell just by cheers listed here and the stuff in other entries its is obvious that I have had a freakin amazing weekend. A weekend that I will never forget in my entire life. I just want to say one thing to every 2004 ambassador and person who reads this just remember : "No matter where we go or what path we take in life, we always take a little bit of each other everywhere" And I find this true, everyone whom I met this weekend and worked with I will always carry a piece of you in my hearts, you are all extremely special to me in a different way and I love you all for that. Thanks for an amazing weekend and thanks for bringing me out of my comfort zone. Keep in touch. Love to all! ~Melissa

      This weekend was by far the best weekend of my life. HOBY is amazing. The people are amazing I feel like I've known these people for my entire life. My group (Lindsey, Chloe, Veronica, Stephen, Chris and Jordan)   were absolutely the BEST. We all got along SOOO well it felt like family. We all worked together amazing as a team. Here's a shout out to each of you:  Chris:  OMG you are hysterical. I love ya. Ride that HOBY Pony. "Front Front Front my baby, Side Side Side my baby, Back Back Back my baby," I wanna see you get down!  Jordan:  You are so sweet. You are really easy to talk to and I am so glad I got to know you. YOu were there to talk to me when I needed it, you never judged anyone and you always made time for everyone. You are a truly unique person and I am lucky to have met you.  Steven:  WOW your market managing techniques are excellent! You really have a talent, use it to your advantage. I am glad to have gotten to know you this weekend. Thanks!  Veronica:  My buddy. You knew all about my Ethan obsession for at least as long as it lasted. Thanks your awesome. Keep in touch!  Chloe:  You are so sweet! You are very bright and have so much going for you! And the Hoby Pony is a game we just enjoy watching right? Its fun to listen to him sing. I hope Chris knows your name now! Thanks for everything this weekend it was amazing!  Lindsey:  You are one of the nicest people I met all weekend. You have a truly sweet personality. Will you ride the HOBY pony? And Hey you've witnessed very big moments in my life this weekend! Eating a Cheese Burger, and me coming out of my shell and being really loud and Cheering. Chris will always keep us laughing. "Wait is it C-H-O-L-E? Or C-H-L-O-O-E? Oh that's Chloe" ahh one of the many Chris moments! Keep in touch, you are the best! Thanks for everything this weekend.  Kara:  My leader. One of the first people I met at HOBY. You are the greatest, you knew about my Ethan love. Chris always kept us laughing. You got my to come out of my comfort zone and be LOUD (which I will continue to do at home I promise) I hope to keep in touch. Thanks for an amazing weekend!  Mike:  Our one and only JC. Who always seemed to be moving boxes or running errands. But don't matter we still love you! Thanks for everything, keep in touch.     Guys this weekend was incredible! I loved it and want to come back as a JC next year. You taught me how to be myself and not worry what others think. I have come from being shy and very quite to LOUD and outgoing and that's amazing no one has ever been able to do that. You all made me the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. Thank you to everyone who has helped with that. And a HUGE shout out to group P always and for ever the Pink Plumbers! "Get it in the crack and win a prize back" you guys are amazing.

Went to Alex's sweet 16 on friday it was a lot of fun. I got my first deep rescue on Wednesday July 14th in Shot Gun Falls! Brittany Hope was 203 so she was there when I got it, she was very very happy for me! I was so excited, I was shaking so much when I got out of the water with the lady. The lady's top fell off so that was a little  awkward    but oh well. I was really excited. Ok well that's all for now.&nbsp; I am GOING to bring my pillow even if I have to carry it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     &nbsp;   ~~Mel~~

      Havent written in a long time. But oh well, nothing really new has happened. Nothing exciting ever really happens. Worked my first deep day yesterday, it wasn't that bad. I was Soooooooo NERVOUS at first but then I got over it and calmed down as soon as Mike Bradley showed me the ropes at the wave pool and Ryan Englebert showed me the ropes at shot gun. I am still really nervous but not as much. I didnt have to work today so i cleaned my room and watch TV cause it was raining so it was really a blah day. I have to work deep agian tomorrow too. Tomorrow is my first all day deep shift, yeasterday I came in at 11:00 and broke people in deep, but tomorrow I have to actually work all day and be in the rotation. Ok well that's all for now I guess. Maybe tomorrow. I'll let you know if I get a rescue tube for my first deep rescue!!!

      Had to be at Splish Splash this morning at a little before 7:00 am wow that is early. I was there till about 9:00 doing the rest of my deep water training. I am FINALLY done. FINALLY considering I started it last wednesday! I can't wait to work deep. Ok submerged concious and submerged unconcious victims in deep water are probably the hardest thing about lifeguarding. It is soooo soooo hard, unless you know what I am talking about you have no idea how hard it is. Submerged concious is not as hard as submerged unconcious. It took me sooo sooo long to get the unconcious victim, and even after I did I am still a little worried about ever having ot use it.   After that I went home took a shower and went to Curves with my mom, oh the fun that was. (said sarcastically) I mean it was ok, not horrible but I guess I am gunna stick with it.  After that I went to the beach with my mom got really really sunburned. I took a walk down the beach with the 2 girls i babysit they are both in second grade going into third. They are so funny. They collected dead, smelly, parts of crabs. It was fun though, they are really cute an really funny to listen to.  Ok I am really sunburned now so i am gunna go watch TV and rest for a long time. Maybe some more later I dont know yet.   ~~Mel~~

      Its like freakin pouring here right now at 9:11am, and when i called Splish Splash they said i still had to come in (lucky me.) I have the active skills tonight for deep!! So that would be the only reason i wouldn't want the park to close. 'Cause I really want to learn them so i can finally start working deep shifts!  RAIN RAIN GO AWAY COME AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY, RAIN RAIN GO AWAY COME AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY, RAIN RAIN GO AWAY COME AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY!!  The rain is sooooo boring, and just blah, it makes you tired, and blah and want to stay in your PJ's all day and watch TV. Oh well, maybe it'll stop!!  ~~Mel~~

      Happy 4th of July!!!!!!!!!!!! Fireworks, Food, Soda, Beach, BBQ, Water, Sunset, etc, all these things make 4th of July so much fun. Yea well that's all I have to say about the 4th of July. We are gunna go to the beach, have a BBQ with some friends, swim, like we do every year.   Ohhhhh I passed my deep upgrade on Wednesday night!! I was the only one in my group to do it on the first shot!!! We had to swim 8 laps in the wave pool. I was about a lap and a half ahead of everyone in the swimming and I ended up doing an extra lap (because I lost count) but thats ok! Then we had to go to the bottom of Shot Gun Falls and get a 10 pound brick from the bottom (doing a surface dive) and bring it up to the surface and tred water for 1 min. But you could lay on your back and hold the brick on your chest so that made it really really easy. Then they tell you to drop the brick and put your hands out of the water and you have to tred like that for 1 min then your done! It got to dark during my training to do the active skills so we are doing that tomorrow night after work. Only Me, and these 2 kids Luke and Alicia passed from our group of about 15 kids. Congratz you guys!! I can't wait to start my deep shifts!! I am looking forward to that!!!   Ok that's all for now. Have a nice 4th of July. I'll write some more tomorrow after my active skills.

       Just wanted to share my expierence with HOBY with all of you. When I arrived at the WLC on Friday July 23, I was so nervous to meet all new people and to be away from home for 10 days. I honestly had no idea what I was getting myself into. I am usually a very shy person but for some strange reason HOBY "brainwashed" me in a very good way and now after returning I am no longer shy. I walk up to people I don't know and introduce myself with no worries or second thoughts about what they'll think of me, like I used to do before HOBY was introduced into my life. HOBY has not only changed me physically or mentally but emotionally as well. Before arriving at the WLC something happened to me, I thought it was the end of the world and I thought everybody was an enemy. I made myself stay very close to home and not trust people. But when I got to HOBY I let all of those barriers down. I realized what happened to me back at home was left at home and this was a place for me to start over and re-introduce myself to people who hopefully would become my lifelong friends. Although I was a little nervous about meeting all of you and putting myself on the line, I am so glad I did. HOBY has changed my life in a way this I can't evenm explain in words (I am sure many of you know how this is) My friends asked me how my week was and where I had been and all I could tell them was that I was with HOBY and words can't even explain how AMAZING the past 10 days had been. They gave me strange looks then looked at my pictures and said  "wow you really can't explain this, over 475 people wearing the same colored T-Shirt, doing the exact same thing, and all because of one man's 'impossible dream', this really is something that can't be explained" I told them they were right and I tried my hardest to explain the jokes that went with the pictures but that was no good, they just didn't understand. When I called my friend she told me that this was the happiest she has heard me in the longest time and she is so glad that I am happy again. HOBY made me laugh and smile for the first time in literally 3 weeks. HOBY made me cry, smile and laugh so hard that my stomach hurt, HOBY is the greatest thing that has happend to me in the longest time. I want everybody to remember one thing :"Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and  let go of what you can't change. Kiss slowly, play hard, forgive quickly, take chances, give everything and have no regrets. Life's too short to be anything but happy." I want everybody to be happy all the time and when things jsut don't seems to be going your way jsut think back to the 10days you spent at the WLC and think about the great times we had and the amazing friendships we made and everything else will seem so much better.I Love and miss each and everyone of you. Please keep in touch.    As you can see my HOBY WLC expierence was amazing. I hope that sometime in your lives you can have an expierence like that. It is one that will never be forgotten. I am glad I went to the WLC and I am looking forward to voulnteering there next year as well as my local seminar.       ~~ M e l ~~

       WLC was amazing. I made friends from just about EVERY single state and friends from many countries including Mexico, Korea, Tawain, Germany, England, Iraq and so many more. And I miss everyone SOOO much. I want everyone to keep in touch and remember: Keep a smile on your face, and faith in your heart and everything else will fall into place. Your future is what you make of it and if you want something you will make it happen and I know every single one of you can do what ever it is you want to do. I have NO voice from all of the cheers including: Boom Chicka Boom, Jigg-a-low, Chester, HOBY, OUTSTANDING and soo many more. But it was well worth it. No Voice= SO much fun!!! I love you all.
