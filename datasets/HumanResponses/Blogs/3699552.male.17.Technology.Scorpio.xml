      Saw shrek 2 tonight, pissa no doubt about it, though I think some of the jokes are just a tad over the 10 yr olds heads... But that's good :D Gmail is pretty good, liking it so far, doesn't make huge differences to me because I don't use email a whole lot, biggest gripe atm though; can't apply filters to emails already received and archived! C'mon guys, that's a bit slack, I would imagine that to be a feature that should be incorporated into the filters part of it first up.. Hell, outlook express can do it!

      goddamn, the past 3 days i've been quite literally scouring the net trying to find an unused gmail invite, because of my timezone the majority get released around 2AM my time and so by the time I get on the net they is all taken. Finally got one about an hour ago and.... *drumroll* gmail is down! talk about frustrating. anyway, gunna post a screenshot of the google 502 error because... well i don't think they're something that's going to happen a whole lot once gmail goes gold/1.0/final/whatever the hell u wanna call it.     Note: the code for these templates must be pretty damn cruddy.

      realised i can't really do this without at least giving myself an introduction! that's downright rude that is. note the 's' in realised, that's because i speak English English not American English and the use of the colloquial saying "Downright" coupled with that s denotes where I'm from... lol, Australia. I'm a 17 year old doing yr 12 VCE in a country town in Victoria Australia called Kerang... kinda crappy that I live in a country town because I'm a bit of a computer nerd.. not too much, just sort of what I'm into, would like to do Software Engineering at Uni next year and couldn't really envisage myself in any form of long term career outside of computing. I actually work at a local Network Consulting Firm and regular computer shop.. depending which has the work to be done, it's a traineeship type thing and I work at both because they have common owners. Hobbies are computers (duh), and cricket.. Love gettin drunk with mates on the weekend, as everyone in this town does (not much else to do... town with population of 3,500 and we have 5 pubs), and yeh... actually that aint a bad idea, I'll try to remember to use this blogspot thingy to record what I do on the weekends when drinkin and such... let's start now coz it was a pretty interesting weekend.  for the sake of the innocent (and coz i feel like being weird) all names have been replaced with either Jane or John.  Had 2 long weekends in a row last week because of queen's birthday and then had friday off for school correction day.. didn't do anything thursday night, friday night went out for tea for Jane's birthday, was ok, nice tea and always good to see ur friends and get out of the house and shit, didn't stay real late though, we'd left the resturaunt by like 8.30.. lol, but then we had to go get fortune cookies at safeway because it had been a chinese resturaunt and they didn't have them.. so we made the trek to safeway and i bought a box of fortune cookies, don't think anyone actually tried eating any (they looked cruddy as) but yeh had to have the "fun" of finding out our "fortunes" which, actually had worse grammar than this that I'm writing right now. worst thing was though that the very LAST fortune cookie in the box i got and i tried to open it but i accidentally ripped it in half and i only found the first half >:(! I was shattered, whatever my fortune was (because OBVIOUSLY the last one will be the most accurate) will remain a mystery to me, will post a pic of the half of it that i have, feel free to make up whatever you think it could say. basically just went home after that, waited around for Jane's (different one) mum to pick her up from down the st so she wasn't just standin round alone and then tried to walk home myself but they chased me in the car and gave me a ride.      Next night.. well what can i say about bloody sat'dy night... in brief: went to mates, played drinkin games for a bit, got pissed, we went to pub, had some vodka shots, went to another pub, was there a while, went to walk out, some bastard i dunno punched me in the eye for no reason then punched me in the head and i got the fuck outta there, then i stood out the front for a bit holdin my eye, cops drove round i went back inside then the cops came in and took me outside and took me home for being underage in the pub.. wankers  can't be stuffed goin into more detail than that, was a weird night and have said it all that many times i wanna forget it.  *phew* that was kinda long, catchya
