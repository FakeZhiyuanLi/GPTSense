      Heh, today I went to.........Butterfly World! It was actually quite good, massive butterflies as big as your whole hand were flying about everywhere! After that I just walked around the garden center that was there too, boring.   Anyway tomorrow I'm going to town with Â£12 (such an awful lot, I know) which will at least be something a bit more interesting, my holidays have been rather boring so far.   Going on holiday in about a week (well, to dads house for a week first), to the Lake District then we're coming back here, then a week later going to Wales, hoping it won't be a boring holiday and that it doesn't rain, that'll really ruin things.

      The past two days I visited my old Primary school to see all my old teachers, with my friend Lauren who I used to go to the school with of course.   We wandered round deciding what had changed and what we remembered like old people talking about their past. It was kinda scary walking round somewhere we hadn't been in over 3 years, but we were still glad to be visiting all the same.   Yesterday was the last day for the Gorse Hill's (my old school's name)&nbsp; students, so we were bombarded with little kiddies for the whole day which was pretty crap. They're so annoying at that age. We took refuge in one of the empty classrooms and stayed there for a good part of the day.  Today was a bit more interesting, partly because there were no more little kiddies so we could roam around as we wished. I brought my Ouija board in to try and contact any dead headmasters or people who had died that used to be students at the school. 2 people contacted us, wasn't very successful though. After playing games with the teachers, we went home, thoroughly worn out. Not much more happened after that, except I ate potato wedges, but thats hardly interesting.

      I hate being a school but I've decided that its better being at school then bored at home.   Today I stayed in bed till 11 o'clock, ate, then sat at the computer. How exciting. Oh, and I also spent about 1 hour trying to figure out how to tape things on my video player.   Hopefully I'm going to watch that film called 'The Hole' on tv tonight, at least I would've done something interesting then (though watching tv is hardly interesting).

      Ok, so it was the last day of school today. It was kinda boring at first, watching films and doing work. Thats all that happened the first part of the day.  Lunchtime was a bit better, because I'd brought in my Ouija board all of us sat there in Mr Runhams room contacting spirits, probably looking like right idiots. We got in contact with two different people, one was called Jean, and the other was a person with a name I can't pronounce. Both didn't say much and disappeared pretty quickly. I think it was because of all the distractions and non-believers in the room with us at the time.  Last lesson was the raffle, good prizes including a bike, dvd player, portable tv, and loads of other cool stuff like that. Of course I had to have my name called out!!! My hair was frizzy, I'm sure I went bright red, and I was in a bad mood for being cramped up in a small space for so long! Got to the front to collect my prize only to realize there was no good prizes left! Pissed off and wanting to sit down again, I wandered to the back of all the people who were all standing at the front. Finally after what seemed like ages, the bell rang and we were all free to go. I escaped having my picture taken with the rest of the winners and ran over to say goodbye to my friends.  Later on, at 5 o'clock, Dee and I went to see Spiderman 2. It was quite good, the highlight of my day! Went after the film to Macdonalds, Dee had a happy meal and I waited for my mum to pick me up.   Boring day, should've stayed at home is my final conclusion. If only I was picked from the raffle sooner so I could've got a dvd player!

      Okay, so was Drayton Manor a waste of money? There was no quick passes, really long queues and a 2 hour trip to get there.   After wandering in, looking lost, me and a group of people decided to go on the nearest ride to us. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst rides I have ever been on! Claiming to be scary and fun, it turned out to be nothing more then a boring fair ground ghost ride. Highly annoyed and tired from the 2 hour line which we had to queue in to get to the actual rubbish ride, we again, wandered off in a search for a good ride.  Finding no rides with short queues, we went on a boring looking water ride (can't remember the name though), which actually turned out to be quite fun! Damp and cold we then went in search of food, and, with finding a hot dog shop, we bought a hot dog each and walked off, munching happily.   After walking round a couple of shops, we decided to see if we could get on the Shockwave (main rollercoaster) in time for our coach leaving, so we ran across the park as fast as we could and started lining up. After a good half-hour, we finally managed to get on the ride, which turned out to be fantastic! Satisfied at last I made one last stop to buy a toy sword (yes!!! Thats all I went there for really!) and made our way back to the coaches.  So the day turned out ok in the end, at least I got to go on the Shockwave rollercoaster, and got my toy sword! Ta ta for now!
