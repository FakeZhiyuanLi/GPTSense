       Episode No.1- Baby Part 1-Backstory.....   Previously in the Buffyverse.... Buffy saved the world, a lot and now it's three years after beneath the Scooby Gang it, err, devoured. Sunnydale's no more. Buffy's been spotted in Mexico and Cleveland, with Lil' sis in tow. Angel and Spike are missing, presumed (and rightly so) dead, Xander's started a new life in Florida and is getting on with construction. He is also helping Willow who is his best friend, next door neighbour and a godess, fight the forces of darkness. And now the guy who guided the gang through the toughest time in her lives has gone back to his birthplace, England. The guy in question is Rupert Giles, a watcher with a background in black magic and with a habit of cleaning his glasses.

      Spiderman 2 is out this week. How long have I been waiting for this? James Franco here I come!  Bought Jet's album, it's great.  Bought McFly's album, it's great.

      Here's my space to write some crap!   Today, McFly. Yes, I like them. Soooooooo? Their album is as cute as hell. On first impressions, I'm liking 'Unsaid Things' and 'That Girl'.  Tom's gorgeous, he others aren't bad either, but I'm guessing he'll be my favourite.  Now, The OC.  Sorry, but The OC is waaaaay more important than McFly..... Ok, of course there's the fact that channel 4 have been very naughty postponing The OC. But I'm over it, it'll just make the next episode more exciting! However funny it is that Ryan has only three expressions (brooding, shocked, blank), the real story is Seth, Anna, Summer. Seth, who I will marry someday (so what if he's fictional, has two great women on his hands. But who is right for him? I love Anna, and they're perfrct together. But, Summer! I think she may actual like him on a deeper level. Did you see her face when she'd just kissed that random on New Years? "You're not Seth Cohen." Today I want him with Summer, tomorrow, probably a different story!

      Oh no!  Not only do I not restrain myself enough so I don't see OC spoilers, I've now bought I t-shirt which says, 'I heart Seth Cohen' on it! Damn it!
