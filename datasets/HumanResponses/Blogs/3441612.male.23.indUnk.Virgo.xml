       Long,long ago there were two friends named Sushiman and Eggroll Boy. These two superheroes were created by Matt and Ben. They were superheroes! Sushiman got his powers by eating a radio-active peice of sushi and Eggroll Boy ate a radio-active eggroll. They were the best friends ever in the history of sushi. In Matts episode, The Wrath of Dr. Zchlongkong, Dr. Zchlongkong drained Eggroll Boy's powers using a power-taker-awayer machine. Then, even though Eggroll Boy told Sushiman that if he killed Dr. Zchlongkong, Eggroll boy would never get his powers back, Sushiman killed him anyway and angered Eggroll Boy. Eggroll Boy became evil and tried to kill Sushiman (episode 5) for not doing this. Unfortunately, Sushiman had to stop him and killed him. Then, Sushami was born {Sushami was created by Kevin} and Sushiman and Sushami went on to stop evil people around the world (or at least Sushiville). And that leads us to where we are today. This is Ima Moron for Fox 5 News.  -Sean (edited by Haig, hehe :)Edited YET AGAIN by Josh =)and edited finally by Matt!!!!!!!!!! :D

       Josh-I am now working on The sushis in the terrible Titan. It has a SURPRISE twist.. DUNUNUH DUNUNUH!!!  Sean-I have figured out what the next episode is going to be. There will be a professional hacker who is trying to hack into the sushi jet's computer. He wants to find the atomic fart button and blow up the city of Sushiville by letting off a huge bronx cheer. The only way to stop this maniac is to regain control of the Sushi Jet. If any of the sushi members have any suggestions about what I should include in the issue just let me know in the draft about the chat.  Matt-hey sushi fans!!! :) im done with the tall man already!!! Im doing one about this caveman called Grunt! Its even better than the tall man one... check it out!!!!!!!!  Ben-YO! Sushi kids, Check out our comix on Sushi Man. Me and my brother Matt invented Sushi Man and wrote the first two episodes!!!!! SUSHI DEFEATS ALL.  Haig-HEEEEEELLLO! I've decided, since i've come up with all these wacky ideas for the Sumo Rebellion, to make, "The Samack Ayou Saga." The Sumo Rebellion ends when the villain, Samack Ayou, flys away since all his bodyguards have been put out by Sushami, and it's just Sushami, Sushi-man, and Samack Ayou. Samack Ayou flys away, still with the cape!!! but fortunately, he leaves the prize of sushi. Which will bring us to episode 16a, where Samack Ayou makes a clone machine, cloning himself and the cape!!! this will start a new group of villains but that episode will be in the 20's or sumthing. Well i havent even finished the Sumo Rebellion yet so i guess i shouldn't get ahead of myself... Well thats all!

       Hello, Haig here :)     Well, if you read the post title, this episode will be about Sushami's Evil Twin. I am going to do this episode, though i haven't started it yet. Basically, there is going to be this time machine that everyone wants to find, since the reward for this is big. But, 3 people want to find this time machine for another reason... DUN DUN DUNNNNNN. Well, 2 of them are Sushi-Man and Sushami. The 3rd is Sushami's evil brother (haven't thought of his name yet). Sushami's evil twin wants the time machine for evil, to be able to go back and time and steal stuff... you know, evil things, and finally, to kill Sushi-Man and Sushami. He wants to kill them when they are young to prevent them from becoming what they are now. And the reason Sushi-Man and Sushami want to get it is to stop Sushamis evil twin from using it. They want to destroy it. At some point, i will have Sushi-Man killed by Sushami's evil twin. THE ULTIMATE DRAMA!!!!!!! Now, it is up to Sushami to find the time machine and save Sushi-Man! I think i will make a part I and a part II. like when Sushi-Man dies, i'll probably end the episode. I know, i'm evil too :)
