      sounds like i'm a psycho cutter... i'm not... i'm a grown ass woman - 34 years old - manager for a health services company...  never been married, don't have any kids...  come from a great family, even w/ my parents having been divorced when i was age 15.  before i keep going - this is my stream of consciousness... don't believe i have an evil heart, but i am not a saint...  trying to figure out a few major things in my life, while maintaining the career and the family - mom, sisters, cousins (tons of 'em), aunts, uncles, etc.  Again, not children...  trying my best to focus on the Lord instead of looking for a husband... pretty good "resume" - accomplished, independent woman, but i think the chickenheads out there seem to end up or "trapping" the "good" man... whatever a good man means...    trying not to settle for good enough, but man...  biological clock is thinking...  didn't think i wanted children after being the eldest of 17 cousins - probably babysat like 10 of 'em and a couple of other extended family's kids, but man o man...  i try so hard to be happy for other people having kids, but i want my own...  i've been successful at not getting pregnant, no std's, because i want to have my children (yes, children w/ a "ren")after i've met someone who could be my life partner - cheerleader, motivator, and sometimes bodyguard/conscience...  but don't know where the hell i'm supposed to find him...  go to the clubs practically every weekend - YES I'VE HEARD THAT I WON'T FIND HIM THERE... but arent' there cool people like me who like to dance but aren't hoes?  anyways, most of the guys at the club are age 26 or below...  not trying to be someone else's babysitter... sheesh...  found God last year - He was always around - just didn't give him props for all my accomplishments great and small...  Actually found God, when I was trying to connive my way into a man's life - guess this is what I get for trying to finagle my way into a man's life who was insisting on going to bible study when i wanted to hang out...  I done fell in love - well what I think is falling in love - with this fool (who i tried to lead away from bible study) who has more drama (i.e. kids which mean baby momma drama) than most daycares...  originally had something racist - well actually against a certain religion - shows a bit of racism, etc.  but it made me halt the stream of consciousness go i had to go back and fix it...  anyways - it's 12:30 i gotta finish up exposing my drama later...  gotta finish up w/ scriptural quotes - from Pastor Hester - i think he got it from the bible, but i like it...  I HAVE FAIT IN DIVINE DESTINY; I DON'T NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING...  I HAVE ANNOINTING AND SPECIAL FAVOR...

      OK - last time I wrote a blog - I didn't get a chance to tell you all about Mark.  Mark is an important part of my life in many ways...  First and foremost, as a vessel of God, he led me back to the church... he did not drag me... he just told me about church... how he goes to church 3x a week... and he never misses church... and how he can't hang out w/ me on tues or thursdays cuz he goes to church... this is the first time I've met someone - other than Belle - who goes to church...  and actually tries to live like a Christian... like no sex - other than GT.  well this part is an issue - and a blessing...  depending on how emotional I am, or when I forget how blessed I am...    Mark used to be a slut.  Guess I think/thought - I know, no conviction... am waffling - that I would be ok if I just slept with him.  I haven't.  NEVER have...  most likely never will...  well it seems like it...  I'm not taking it into my own hands -wavering... trying not to - I put it on the shelf.  Somewhere along the line, Mark decides not to be a slut and hang out w/ me, cuz i'm such a good friend.  God bless me!  I want to be able to believe that 100%!!!  But it sure hurts like heck... he hangs out w/ me cuz he doesn't want to have sex with me...  he apologized yesterday, because he doen't hang out w/ me cuz he doesn't want to have sex with me... he hangs out w/ me cuz he likes to hang out w/ me... i guess if i believed i was blessed and had faith; i guess i should feel happy and special that he didn't want to have sex with me cuz it would ruin our friendship.  I know this - if I slept with him; it'd probably get weird - and he'd just be another booty call that i talk to randomly.  Is that what I want?  I have faith that the Lord has a plan for me.  If my husband isn't supposed to be Mark according to God's will, then yes I want to live my life according to God's will... I sure as heck don't know what I want.  I want Mark to be a part of my life - he is a good spiritual leader for me, but I think of him as my equal in that he's not a preacher/spiritual leader.  He's someone that I can truly fellowship with; but he's not on a pedestal.  I can talk to him about most anything - well most anything - except my going out w/ other men.  I thought he tripped - he says he didn't - but I would swear he did.  Yesterday he said he didn't care, but he gave me much drama about seeing/sleeping w/ SG.  Just to clarify, he tripped not cuz I slept w/ SG, but cuz I "say" I want to get with him, but I slept w/ SG anyway...  HUH?!?!?!  I know...    He says I don't really want to be with him, cuz I see other people... which kinda led me to believe that I thought I had a chance... chance for what???  Sleep with Mark which would be the beginning of the end, if he is still (and yes, he does) in love with Tracy.  I want to call her a chickenhead - and I normally do... but she puts up w/ more of Mark's chauvinistic crap that I do... God bless her anyway...  I'm trying...  I'm trying...  Anyways - back to my point about "I don't really want to be with him, cuz I see other people..."  Well, I started to see other people cuz I couldn't have him.  I am craving closeness... but I can't just be w/ anybody.  Trust me - been there, and back again, done that again and again - and I still confirm over and over.  I'm sick and tired of sleeping w/ someone - and the pleasure - if it's there is over before he/I walk out the door. I do so much better with fools who live hella far away - like K from Bakersfield and CN from Sac.  At least, I like CN from Sac, but what am I going to do w/ someone who seems to care for me over the phone, but will only see me in Reno... and who's got 4 kids...  man o man o man... why do i do this to my self?  So after getting into it yesterday w/ Mark, he finally gets the point that I am so lonely and offers me a hug...  he missed the BIG POINT over our conversation that I care for him and that it hurt me so much when this other female was just touching his leg and called him "babe" in front of me - ya, it hurt like hell...  made me want to throw up for real...  but this female gets to put her hands on him, and i can't... and then he tells me that he never said that i couldn't... so how the hell am i supposed to be a good friend, helping him stay on the path that he's taking - that i'm also taking - and be able to touch him?!?  and then he offers me a hug?!?!?!  and he walks out when i ask him that i couldn't give him  a hug at that particular moment in time?!?!?!?!  not to mention the fact that i'm balling like i didn't cry when my dad died?  (ya i know another issue)... side note - been thinking alot about pa lately - think it's basketball... i was itching to buy a ewing basketball jersey for pa... then i found out it was $260... then i thought is this really for pa or for me?  anyways, i miss my pa...  i'm so confused about me/men...  this is another thing that i'm confused about - if he's so thankful that i'm such a good friend to him that i've never led him astray and i help him in a lot of ways and that he also likes to hang out with - and that we have so many things in common - why would he want to be w/ me?  i know - another issue - self-esteem issue... started to think - i'm not pretty enough... my boobs ain't big enough - cuz damn his women do have some that are bigger than mine... but only tracy is pretty... the san jose chick - is aight...  but man o man o man... i'm trying to be kind... even thought that i couldn't get a man/him cuz i don't have an ass...  stop it cat.  it's on the shelf... if he can't see how much i have done - still doing - but need to stop doing for him - then he's too stupid, blind to be w/ me anyway... stop it, cat! i have faith...  the Lord has a plan for you - if it ain't him - then He's got a better one planned for you... maybe someone not as chauvinistic...    it's 3:15 in the morning.  JLo and Randy were supposed to call me to tell me that they got home ok - guess they fell asleep and done forgot about me...  Dave Chapelle is the funniest, non-PC guy...  glad I went w/ Mark and Randy - even if I didn't really interact w/ JLo at the show.  Also Thank God for hearing my prayer about moving up closer to the stage.  We had the best seats...  Closing with scripture... For my personal life He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, 'He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. Psalm 91:1-6 NIV    For work - Albert sent me hate mail.  It hurt.  But why am I listening to a over dramatic flamin' alcoholic and drug purging queen?  Is there truth to what he said?  I've raised call volume by 20 a week since I got there.  Not happy w/ it, but it's a considerable amount.  Lots of operation issues as to why the numbers aren't there, but am I doing more damage to the company than help?  No, I don't think so... but i'm so quick to doubt myself...  stop it, cat.  if you prayed on it - and you sometimes do - i just need to pray more often - then it's aight...  Colossians 1:9-11:   "For this cause we...do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of [God's] will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness."   Thank you Lord for the blessings...  I am a Spirit-filled, strong, independent, intelligent business woman who is caring, with maternal instincts, and loving and who would be a good faithful, supportive wife and mother...  Lord, I want to pray in tongues, but all that comes to mind is that stupid rap song supersonic... Help me, please...  In Jesus name, I pray.  Amen.
