						   The twins woke me up at 6:00 am.  Time to start the day!  Got their bottles ready.  They can hold their bottles on their own now so while they ate I checked + answered e- mails.  When the girls were finished I put them down on the floor to play while I washed dishes.  I got down on the floor and played with them for about an hour.  I sang songs to them and said nursery rhymes while they played with their Piglet and Winnie the Pooh stuffed toys. They started getting a bit cranky... time for them to go back to bed for a little bit.  While they slept I took the weed eater to the outskirts of our home.  I came back in and took a shower.  Checked e-mails again.  The girls woke up again.  It was 9:30 am and time for breakfast.  I fixed their cereal and another bottle. Fed them and then gave them their baths.  We played on the floor again with their blocks.  I put in a Sesame Street Song CD while we played with blocks.  I put them in the kitchen with me so I could watch them while I cleaned out the fridge. I figured I better get this done because my son will be back in from Texas in a couple more weeks because school will be starting again.  My roommate woke up; time to take him to work.  I stopped at the store on the way to taking him to work to pick up some more baby shampoo.  Dropped him off and went through the drive through at Burger King to get me something to eat.  Came on home.  It's lunch time for the girls.  I went to my granny's house to let the girls visit and made sure she had eaten.  Nap time again for them. Went back home and put them down for a nap.  Checked e-mails.  Tons of spam as usual. Delete, Delete, Delete...  Time for me to get some work done.  I have one  urlLink Select Solo Ad  to send out today to my subscribers.  Done with that.  I'm the Update Admin for the  urlLink AdMistress , Marion Stearns, and I have one update so far to send out to the publishers.  Oops.  That is going to have to wait for a bit.  I heard Ali (the youngest twin)... she woke up and is not happy.  I held Ali for a while and Amy played on the floor.  Ali finally was in a better mood and I picked up Amy and held her so she wouldn't feel left out.  The electrician called and said he'd come over to fix my  breaker that went bad.  He showed up and I fed the girls their supper while he worked on the box.  I put the girls to bed.  Almost 7pm.  Ali wasn't happy about having to go to bed, but I always try to get them to bed no later than 7pm every night.  They sleep better if I do.  Checked e-mails again.  Oh yeah... I have that update to send out. I better get to it.  Done.  Time for me to advertise  urlLink MY advertising services .  50 classified Ads placed.  With that done, I needed to answer some personal e-mails. I'd been putting that off for 4 days now.  Taken care of.  Time to clean house.  The bathroom FIRST!  Next the kitchen floor, swept and mopped.  The living room needs to be picked up (toys all over).  Vaccuumed too.  Folded clothes.  Put a load in the washing machine.  Hmmm... wondered why I was getting a headache. The only thing I ate today was a whopper from BK!  Fixed me a sandwich.  No time and didn't feel like cooking that late.  Checked e-mails again while eating.  Took a look at my Ryze Page and opted not to add anything tonight.  urlLink     Hung the clothes up to dry.  Took some groundmeat out of the freezer and put in the fridge to make meatloaf tomorrow.  Sat down and took a break.  Today was a slow day. Next Monday the Regular Issue will go out... that will be a busy Monday.  My son called from Texas.  He'll be coming home tomorrow to visit with me, his sisters, and granny and then he'll go back to Texas for a bit longer.  I miss him and will be happy to see him.  He's been gone 3 weeks visiting with our cousin for the summer.  Time to post this and then read some of the Ezines that I subscribe to.  See you again tomorrow night! :)

						   I just finished setting up the blog so I'm just posting a little bit of my ramblings to start it all off.  So here we go.  Have you thought about working at home?  It's not as easy as some people think it is. You have your own business.  Is it going to run itself?  No!  You have to be ready to deal with issues pertaining to it almost 24/7 in between taking care of the family if you have one.  Would I want it any other way?  NO! I enjoy working at home.  I'm supposed to be off today.  Hmmm.. what happened? Oh yeah!  I started reading e-mails and saw something about blogs and figured I'd give it a shot.  This blog will be in no way, shape, or form being written to deter you from following your dream of working at home if that's what you want.  In fact, it's the opposite.  It's been created to show you that if I CAN do it... So CAN YOU!  Who knows I may turn this into an e-book some day. :)  I better get some rest before the twins decide to wake up... it's been a looonnng day!  Good night to you.
