      Message: A girl and guy were speeding over 100mph on the road... Girl: Slow down. Im scared. Guy: This is fun!!!! Hold on to me. Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary! Guy: Then tell me you love me. Girl: I love you, please, slow down. Guy: Now please give me a big hug! *Girl hugs him* Guy: Can you take my helmet off baby? It's bugging me.. In the paper the next day:  A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so that  she would live even though it meant that he would die. Now if there is anyone on here that you love  and care for that much copy this and repost........  Copyright © 2002-2004 Friendster, Inc. All rights reserved.

      Ewan ko ba sa araw na to, parang nalulungkot ako. Di ko naman alam kung bakit. Parang clueless ako kung bakit ganito ang feeling ko. Did it ever happened to you, na parang ang lungkot ng araw mo, parang may kulang na hindi mo maintindihan? Parang may namimiss ka na ewan ko ba...Siguro nga may namimiss lang ako, na gustong-gusto kong makita, pero di ko sya pwedeng makita. O kaya naman pwede ko syang makita, pero kailangan kong pigilan ang sarili ko, kase mahirap na...Tapos ganito pa yung mga kanta sa  urlLink homeradio . Nakikinig kase sa work ngayon nang radio sa Pilipinas, alam nyo ba yung HomeRadio Manila 97.9, puro mga love songs na kanta sa Pilipinas...Hay parang nakakainlove na ewan ko rin...Nakakaramdam ba kayo nang ganito kung minsan...Clueless na ewan ko nga ba...It's one of those days, di naman ako homesick, I think may namimiss lang akong tao...ewan ko talaga...

      The algebraic expression in your eyes, The geometric symbol in your face, Is the perpendicular bisector of my heart. The vertex of your day and the base angle of our life, Is the isosceles triangles of my soul.  An axiom of addition, you plus me equals...not two but one.  It can be added, it can be subtracted, It can be multiplied, it can be divided, But can never be ended.  LoVe is the living stone of magnetism, You plus me, you will be the south and I will be the north. So we'll be, but the square root.  The theorem is, "I LoVe You So." But the hypothesis is, "Do you love me also?" The postulate is co'z "I do care for you." And the fact to be proven is, "Do you care for me, too?"

           "Sometimes love can make us do things beyond our comprehension, things we could not possibly do if love is not in the way. No matter how we stop ourselves and follow the course of logic, LOVE will find a way to attain its fullfillment..."       "True LOVE holds no records of wrongs and dictate no conditions, no if's, no but's. If we truly love somebody, we love the person without taking into consideration the past that person has had..."

           How does one know for sure if they have met a soulmate? Have you found yours?      I have read from the internet that “soulmates are on the same level of some kind of energy vibration, that’s because they were made from the same energy, and at the same time.” But not all soulmates are born at the same time. Soulmates can either be younger or older than you. Some say that soulmates can be found from your dreams. You either have dreamt about that person already and you just don’t know who that person is, not until you met him/her. However, generally speaking, soulmates - you will notice the person, that person has “something” in her/him that you will feel, like warmth and that look. You will either have that vibration, you’re entire being feels like its vibrating but in a higher frequency.      If you asked me if I have found my soulmate, I’m not so sure. But I think I did, a few years ago. When I met this person, we already have that look and that vibration. But we both ignored it, until one time it was summer, I met him again. But I thought it was just one of those coincidental thing. Once again, we had that vibrating feeling. I thought, “Nah, this is not for real, because I just met the person." I thought it’s one of those attraction between man & woman, but it’s not. Everytime we see each other, we like, our whole body vibrates when we’re near each other, but we don’t have that physical attraction. We just have that energy.  As time moves on, this person and I became really close, don’t get me wrong, just close, to the point of becoming best of friends. And we pretty much get along. We sometimes clashed and ended up not talking for more than 2 months, but we still find ourselves meeting each other. And then back to the way we are.       For a few years, I lost contact with this person. We have made some changes in our lives. We’re both getting mature and growing up, so we both kind of lead our own life. But then in the beginning of January 2004, we met again. And what do you know. The vibration that I thought would fade away because of a long time not seeing this person and not talking to this person would be gone. But I know it’s still there. I still can feel it and much more, stronger. I don’t know if that person is my soulmate or not? All I know, after a few years of not seeing this person, we somehow have that connection, that enegy and vibration. We’re somehow back to that old times. I’m just not so sure why after a few times we lost contact, we always ended-up on that dead-end of the road. We once again, met again...

      This is my first time doing a webpage. I'm so new at this and I need all the help that I can get. I heard this website from a friend and he's been telling me to do one, but I never get a chance to up until now. Sooo bored at home that here I am surfing through the net, and ended-up doing a blogspot.  Sitting down for a few hours figuring out how to add a photo on this thing can be so frustrating...But thanks to my patience that I get to figured it out. And what do you know, I ended-up having fun posting photos at this webpage. Now I can get to share with you the "photo's of my life."  Please feel free to send me any suggestions on how I can improve this webpage of mine. I still have a lot to learn and I'm willing to learn it little by little.  Thanks to a friend of mine who suggested me into doing my own blogspot. If you want to check his webpage, just visit him at:  urlLink umiibabaw , believe me he has so many interesting photos there...

      Hi everyone! It's been awhile since I logged in. Just to let everyone know. I'd been to Hawaii. Been gone for a week and got back to work just this week. Hawaii, what a place, what an experienced! Truly a wonderful and amazing place on this planet. Very much relaxing....Huhuhhu...what am I doing back at work? I shouldn't be here...Reality Bites everyone, it surely does! This is the reality, doing the same routine over and over again...Get up in the morning, get ready for work, drive to the valley, and show time at work...Don't you get sick of it...Sometimes I must admit, I do. But without bills to pay then we wouldn't be working. But work, hmnp...work is good, but vacation is better....hehehehe... Friday the 13th, no wonder everyone is in a bad mood...I guess including me. Don't mess with me today, I woke up cranky and grumpy. Don't know why! People bugging early in the morning, man, I could almost just want to yell and throw some tantrums on them...Better watch out! Nah, just kidding... Anyway, have a good Friday the 13th to you all out there...Be careful Oh yeah! I'll post some pics from Hawaii, watch-out for that...
