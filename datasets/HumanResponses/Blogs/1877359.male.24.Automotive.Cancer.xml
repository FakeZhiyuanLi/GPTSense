      Okay so here I am, I have had this Blog for just under a year and to date it has only been used by me ad my friend to post childish taunts to one another whilst we are at our respective workplaces.

It's late, it's Saturday night and fueled by tacos and a couple of Budweiser's I have decided to use my Blog for good instead of evil. That's right my friends from now on this will be a place for me to transcribe my thoughts, voice my opinions, and vent my day to day frustrations.

I doubt this will be updated on a daily basis, hell with the lack of thinking I do I would say a safe guess is a monthly basis for updates.

So dear reader I hear the questions sprouting in your mind "Why is this guy doing this on a Saturday night?" or " Does this guy actually have a life to write about?". Well let me assure you I do, I am just away for the weekend with my girlfriend and she has already retired to bedroom were I will be after I have emptied my mind via my keyboard. We just had a discussion as to my level of crassness. Apparently I can be a little over the top at times and need to realize when I have gone to far. Okay I'll admit it, although not in the heat of a discussion (argument) that I can be a little over the top at times, but can't we all?

I mean, haven't we all been caught up in the heat of the moment and you end up saying things in jest that, as soon as the have sprung forth from your tongue, you regret. You get that feeling in the pit of your stomach that says that your last comment has a massive chance of being taken in the most offensive manner possible and not in the good humor you intended. That is the point were time suddenly goes into slow motion and you can see your early death coming. You see the person face drop at the same point you sit there and try to come up with something to water down the last remark, but, try as you might, this saving grace never comes to you and you are left there at the mercy of your audience.

Sometimes they are a forgiving lot and sometimes not, on some occasions they realize you did not intend to offend but you do understand you have over stepped the mark, on these occasions the conversation dropped for a moment and you find everything has returned to normal within several minutes. On other occasions you find that the discussion goes on for an inordinate amount of time and then you find yourself sitting on a couch alone spilling your guts on Blog. 

Well now you understand why this started I have but one parting message. Never let bad air sit undisturbed to long, because in the end it becomes so repugnant that no amount of talking or forgiveness can ever remove the stench of it from a relationship. Whether it be a friend, family member, lover or work colleague, take the time to clear the air before it is to late, or you may find yourself surrounded by the foul stench of failed relationships at every turn. I have seen this happen recently and don't wish to go through it myself.

On that note my friends I leave you as I go to spray the Glen 20 of goodwill with my girlfriend. Hope you garnered something from my ramblings. See you next time.
