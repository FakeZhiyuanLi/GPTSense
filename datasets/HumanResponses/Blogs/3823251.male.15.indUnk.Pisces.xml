       i actually dont know what hit me but i set out on making a Class Library that deals with the 4 number systems... its supposed to be completely interconvertable and derived from the  System.Object  with 2 made-by-me interfaces, the  IConvertable  interface and some other implementations...  i'l post the source here once it actually does something!

       well first of all, its not the companies vs each other, it such a case, MS wud hav surely won!  its abt the Missions/Philosophies of both the Giants!  first the links:   Google -  urlLink http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html    Microsoft -  urlLink http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/mission/     although both of them are quite same, they seem so different... google says that it makes users their primary focus... n they r quite good at it... MS on the other hand say this but as far as i think, are not delivering it!  the most intrestin stuff was:   (MS)Excellence - In everything we do do they do it? i sure think tht theres nothin equal to their Visual Studio for development! and Longhorn is looking far too good...   (Google)10. Great just isn't good enough.  ...This constant dissatisfaction with the way things are is ultimately the driving force behind the world's best search engine.
