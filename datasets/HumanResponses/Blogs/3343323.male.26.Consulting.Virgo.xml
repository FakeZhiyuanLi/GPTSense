      Given the chance, with impunity, I'd revel in the opportunity to bend, twist and break your heavenly halo. I would steal away the saintly and leave it with tainted imperfection around the edges. With passionate delight, I would grin a ghastly smile as I corrupted your holiness and violated your divine gates as a crusader turned heathen. Under the great siege, your gates would be penetrated and your shrine destroyed, or at the very least, desecrated. Indeed, your great temple would be spoiled and defiled. The great white angel wings that so delicately carry you from the realm of mortals to perfect heaven, I would thoughtlessly clip to keep you from returning; Suddenly caged and deprived of glorious freedom forevermore in isolation. As for the flawless and radiant cloud you would recline upon and gaze down toward the earth, I would, through sheer will, turn it to a dark thunderhead full of deadly lightning. The only detail darker than my intention would be your welcoming and yearning for it.

      Its under the surface, just out of sight. Suddenly, I'm on my knees, and she's on her last defense. The storm is looming on the horizon, drifting closer, and the tempest shall breathe onto my earth and scorched landscape. I have a secret wish that I yearn to share, but I'm still here unaccompanied. Each day, I leave a little more behind, as I know I will, but little bits remain underneath my skin. From our first goodbye, to our last hello, I could never pinpoint what was markedly absent. We both live, we both crave, and we both change who we are inside our hearts while we search for the next moment. Perhaps the only truth to embrace is that the only constant change? I'm closed, but even I know that hearts can open and intellects can surrender in a moment of primitive heat. It is these currents that help me understand my dark heart and reject the notion that I am more clever than any other that has mastered the art of communication. However, in that, I feel that I reach down twenty thousand leagues, and find you in a place no other has found. However, when I dive to search you, I painfully discover I'm hitting my head on the bottom of a shallow filled bathtub.

      Just let go; There is a time for letting go...and that time is at hand.  Stop choking the life from it and release the grip of heart and mind. Nothing will come to pass. Dreams are just dreams and only serve to cloud the drifting romatic heart. Perhaps its my personal penance for all the mistakes I have made and continue to make. Waking today, I suddenly see clearly that hate in the heart destroys any residual love and inhibits any future growth. The solution is simple, but its the implementation that has the sticking points. Its all a matter of "letting go".

      Ticket for one, but there is a second. Leaving the empty station, the slow griding of the engine increases in velocity and shadow. As the locomotive departs, the sun is sinking into the horizon, battling helplessly and vainly to push the darkness away. Before long, the darkness swirls around your head and the train's throttle is wide open racing farther in my personal darkness. Its disturbing and malignant, but it's also docile and enigmatic. Far away places, and twisted scenes mark the landscape outside the window of the passenger car. The night has arrived and the moon is ghostly. I ride this train, but its only because I'm searching for the other person to accept the ticket and join my side.

      Once there was an overzealous man given to irrational madness, extreme tangent scenarios, and near biploar episodes. Let it be know that too much thinking advances the journey of science in leaps but impedes everything else. With regret, I concede I know nothing, or at the very least, next to nothing. However I am keenly aware that I do not wish to be an option.

      Some days I feel ethereal. Floating in silence, I am right beside you, in the burning sunlight and hovering over you in the darkness of night. Invisible, intangible and without form, I drift into your thoughts and then back out just as stealthily. If I were to manifest myself, I would be the scientist that changes the quantum outcome because I peeked into your world. Ironically, when I wish the electron between us to snap up, it can only but snap down. Moments, nanoseconds, space time, all twist inside my consciousness and I dream of some invisible connection that will unite the seemingly infinite number of variables that set us apart. The space between us is empty and cold. I yearn for heat, for a fusion of intellect, and a physical sensation that will make the eternity bearable once more. Once again I find myself moving from one plane to the next, from the grandeous cosmic scale to the diminuative subatmoic one, and back once more. In these journeys, I long to extend the invitation to an equally worthy traveler, but alas, this odyssey is but mine alone at this juncture. Surrender to me, and join this expedition to chart this unknown stratum of human need and desire. Relent, surrender your form to me, so that for a brief moment, all this can melt away, and energy will overtake this entropy.

      Despite overwhelming propaganda to the contrary, truth is the unwelcome monster in the room. Truth is beautiful when its suites an intended end or supports some hopeless, positive notion that sprang forth from misguided optimism. The only other concept as appalling and repulsive as truth is that of honesty. Humans asks for an honest opinion when they ruthlessly desire to elicit praise, sympathy or compassion.  To put it bluntly, to put it succinctly, I find it repulsive and even pugnacious. Ultimately, the singular reason that truth clings to the mental plane of existence down to this day is due exclusively to its ability to generate the opposite state of any current mental situation. In that, its all to true that misery loves company. To illustrate, it spins the joy into sadness, morphs the happiness into anger, and reverses the general march of well being leaving only doubt and regret in its wake. I reject you because I know your intentions and how you've held my head under the water till I feel my lungs burn for life giving air. Stars stop shining because they exhaust that massive fuel resources of light gases, or because someone told them the truth regarding their inescapable eventually. I'm dripping with poisonous sarcasm when I proclaim my affinity for truth, honesty, and all the happiness it imparts to the recipient.

      My red blood surges with restlessness strangely intertwined with listlessness. Nothing comes of these paradoxes, my paradoxes, but vivid, biting insanity and provocative torpidity. And the mask slips as this sweet moment on my tongue washes away. I'm peering deeper in the chasm, embracing the void, and shaking hands with the abyss. Enticed by desire and rebuked by conscience, this human wears a path into the earth over unmeasurable eons of time as he paces back and forth. Caged rapaciousness, denied lasciviousness, with a spattering, or even a glimmer, of lustful desire. The soul machine can be repaired, but will the gears and cogs spin in the same precision that marked its fantasmo inception. Dare I speak further and risk drenching my heart in this darkness?  The mind imagines a favorable outcome, while the whispers in the shadows gain strength until screaming voices of decent overwhelm the projected positivity and possible gains. Hearts of stone rarely open without the heat of the earth to soften them back to their molten state; Even the dead heart revives but danger lurks within because the extreme temperatures and powerful magnetic pull consume without forethought or regret. Overwhelming beauty, absolute truth, and unimagineable horror all await inside. The sicky, silver smile of forever glares through beaming white teeth that lead me toward the horizon.

      Turning up the music, I tilt farther back in the chair, sinking deep into the faux leather, and drink a scalding sip of my Earl Gray. Almost awake, but half asleep, I try to coax memories from the recesses of my mind. Holding fast in hiding or fading from view, I cannot capture the image I search my mental catalogue for. Strange, disturbing, and chthonic. But in a moment of realization, the answer blindsides me. In a tenebrous world full of failure and rusting hearts, I now begin to understand there is never a second first time.   Ironically, the same heart and mind that battle for dominance have concluded a treaty between themselves that I have only know become aware of. Her face was never meant to be a memory, and that fact is complimentary, not a memory anomaly. I could study it secretly, with unnoticed stares, and truth be told, I have stolen many glances. The memory fades like ink on aged paper because it provides the passageway to a fresh first time each time. Beauty beheld and forgotten so that it may be rekindled anew on the subsequent meeting.  Perhaps, when my heart strengthens, I may share this insight. Until then, I am left in anticipation for the next rendezvous or encounter to recover a purged memory.

      The peaceful silence that invades my brain is soft and refreshing. The witching hours melt in a splendor that leaves me searching for words. The evening was eventful with unexpected company, a delightful game of strategy, and a sweet, awkward conversation. Sometimes the simple zen that pervades is the best ruling principle. Its easy to be constructed, composed, and classical, but not so easy to be revealed, inviting, and human. Delightedly lost in the waves of this notion, I find it all too distracting to live in the moment. It's the past that chases us to the present, all the while I was looking in the future. Time for insomnia.

      So it begins.  This place is new and bright where I may chronicle adventures, perspectives, and regrets. It's the human experience. Its overdone and undercooked. I sleep, I stand, I work, I remember.  He who believes in nothing is unrestrained. He who has faith is enlightened. And, ultimately he that walks will find a journey.

      It was once said, "altissima quaeque flumina minimo sono labi," and I agree. But where is the one that will learn this truth about me, and that I may learn the truth about her. Dark, dismal, and gloomy days fill my pockets even when the sun is burning my face and chasing away clouds from the sky. Adding insult to injury, the dream, with the blue face in the mountain, keeps returning night after night. In my mind's eye, I can see the face so clearly. Peering eyes gaze into my own and subsequently close slowly and forever. The dreams keep coming, its as though I have to bat them away, in my deepest recesses, for they are overflowing with trenchant meanings that are crossing the great divide to wander into my conscious moments. Perhaps this manifestations are a beautiful requiem for all the things slipping through my hands. Until knowledge brightens the path, and the thundercloud before me breaks the silence with a terrible slap, I shall hide it all in the gloomy hearts.

      Changing shells, the hermit crab felt a sense of fear and loss. His small eyes surveyed the external and internal walls that he once found too confining but strangely comfortable. Time and travels had carried him to this moment of bittersweet change. His heart, his mind, and his soul found a sweet freedom in the possibilities ahead, but a sadness in the carved paths left behind.
