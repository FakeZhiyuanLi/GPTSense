      Thank you for visiting our website. Our site contains actual vacation photos, reviews, ideas, and must-not's, etc.  We are 4 women/chicks (we are all happily married and three of us have 2 kids - each having - YES, we planned it this way - a boy and a girl). We'll touch more upon THAT later.  There's ANNE, ROSANNE, PHYLLIS & DEBBY. Long, long ago, in 1992, our husbands starting going to Kenora, Canada every year for their fly-in fishing trip. So we began our search for places WE wanted to go and visit. Some of us wanting to go snow skiing and some of our husbands show NO INTEREST, so off we went.  Our first trip was in 1993, to Clearwater Beach, FL, where Anne's parents own a 3bdrm condo right on the beach (inquiries about that are welcome). WE HAD A BLAST! We have so much fun on our trips. Being with good friends helps. The following pages will reveal that, too.  We appreciate any feedback, suggestions of places to see, etc.  We've even had to plan our children around these vacations...."NO, you can't get pregnant now! STOP!"  Anne &amp; Phyllis live in the St. Louis area. Debby lives in Atlanta and Rosanne lives in Leesburg, VA.   VACATIONS WE'VE BEEN ON :  Clearwater, Florida -  APRIL 1994  - we highly recommend the sunset PIRATE cruise.  Carnival Cruise to the Western Carribean -  May 8, 1995  we departed from Miami for tons of snorkling, shopping, eating, drinking, ....  Puerto Vallarta, Mexico -  1996  - all inclusive resort (the way to do it!). TIP: Don't walk around on the streets outside of the resort at 2am!   1997  - Ironwood, Wisconcin to snow ski at WHITE-CAP MOUNTAIN  urlLink http://www.skiwhitecap.com/home2.html . We took a brave trip by truck into a nearby town (HURLEY, WI), we were looking for darts and pool tables. THEN, a side trip to St, Paul, MINN to the MALL OF AMERICA (oh yeah! We were there for 1-1/2 FULL days and we missed an ENTIRE floor!)   1998  - Clearwater Beach - AGAIN! - We have to take advantage when ANNE's condo is available!  Myrtle Beach, SC -  May 1999  - only 3 of us went on this. Rosey WAS pregnant with her daughter, which she had on that Wednesday morning. And sadly, Rosanne's dad passed away that very afternoon! But, please call ahead of time to see when BIKER week is. WE DIDN'T!  Ogunquit, Maine -  May 2000  - OOOOOOH BY THE WAY.....can you say LOBSTER?  Keystone, Colorado -  February 2001 , stayed in the village. Great fun. Ask Anne if drinking a martini at a high altitude is any different than having one in St. Louis?  Hilton Head, SC - May 2002 -  found a great condo on  urlLink www.vrbo.com    OUR TENTH ANNUAL VACATION  was on a cruise - Royal Carribean Cruise to the Eastern Caribbean - MUCH nicer cruise line.   2004 trip: September 16-21, 2004  - we are going to New York City. We are going to see Ground Zero, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty (we are able to get closer to her now!), HAIRSPRAY, the Sex And the City Bus Tour, and YES watch for us on the TODAY show that Monday Morning. We'll have our chicken hats on (hence our webiste "4vacationingchicks").
