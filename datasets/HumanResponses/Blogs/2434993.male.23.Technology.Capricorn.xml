                    How Microsoft Develops and Releases Software Patches      By Jeffrey R. Jones, Senior Director, Microsoft Security  Business Unit       When we launched our first security newsletter in December, I asked you to  send me your comments and feedback so that I could be your advocate at Microsoft  for security issuesand you delivered! I appreciate the many e-mail messages  with comments and questions, and we will begin answering them this month.   One particular question raised by many of you focused around the Microsoft  process for patching known vulnerabilities. This is an important topic to many  of you, so this month I will describe the lifecycle of a software vulnerability  from time of disclosure until a patch and Security Bulletin release.   The Microsoft security response process follows the general steps of  reporting, investigation, development, test, and release.   The security response process starts with the reporting of a potential issue.  Microsoft uses our membership in the  Organization for Internet Safety   to strongly promote the principles of responsible reporting. A central principle  is the belief that the best way to minimize customer risk is for security  researchers to work closely with vendors to identify issues and fix them before  they are publicized.   When Microsoft releases a patch concurrently with an announcement of a  vulnerability, it is a result of having identified the issue and worked through  the patch release process prior to communicating publicly. This means our  customers will have an opportunity to protect themselves from malicious hackers  seeking to exploit the vulnerability. However, when vulnerabilities are  announced publicly at the same time Microsoft is notified, customers remain  exposed to malicious attackers.   Once a potential issue is reported to Microsoft, either privately or  publicly, our team immediately begins an investigation to reproduce and verify  the reported issue and to identify any associated or variant issues.  Historically, only about 1 out of 10 reported issues turns out to be a new and  unique security issue that warrants opening an investigation, while the other 9  fall into categories of known issues, non-security issues, or errors.   If an issue is replicable, a priority is assigned to it and potential fixes,  mitigations, and workarounds are developed. Weve learned over time that  mitigations and workarounds are very important for empowering users to control  when and how they manage their risk. Chartered with defining and implementing  the process for responding to reported software security issues, the Microsoft  Security Response Center works closely with the affected product group to do  this investigation, and, further, to expand the investigation to other supported  versions of products so that we can gain a complete understanding of how an  issue may affect customers.   One of the most challenging elements of this process is testing. It is  critical to our customers that whatever changes we make to a product have little  to no impact on existing installations and applications. For a product such as  Internet Explorer, for example, the breadth can be significant. Microsoft  currently supports three major versions of Internet Explorer (5.01, 5.5, 6)  across several minor versions (for example, Internet Explorer 6 gold and  Service Pack 1) across several operating systems (Windows 98, Windows Me,  Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003) for more than 25 languages.  In total, to fix one Internet Explorer issue, Microsoft builds and releases more  than 400 unique packages, tested on an even larger number of combinations.   Complementary to taking these steps to help customers more ably protect  themselves from malicious attackers, the Security Response Center and Security  Business Unit offer outreach programs and prescriptive guidance through our Web  properties, through support channels, and directly through our interactions with  customers.   Most importantly, what this means to us is that, even as we are driving  urgently for timely delivery of a patch for serious security issues, we are  motivated to focus as much on the quality part as the timely part so that we  can deliver the quality and protection our customers demand. It is essential  that each patch installs properly, addresses the security issue, and does not  disrupt other existing functionality. It is a job Microsoft takes very  seriously.   To learn more about Microsoft Security Response Center policies or to report  suspected security vulnerabilities, visit the  Microsoft  Security Response Policy and Practices  website.   Again, thanks for the comments and feedback, and I encourage you to keep it  coming. Let me know if this article helped answer some of the questions you  had.

                                       Similarities and Difference between C# and Other        Languages     By    John        Godel              Introduction           You should know that many C/C++ developers have been        asking this question: Is C# a new programming language or a new version of        C/C++. My answer to both questions is that none of these definitions is        true. Well, in this article I'm going to go under the hood and show you        that C# is a cocktail of Java, C, C++ and Delphi/C++ Builder from Borland.        Let's first take a look what C# programming language really is.           What is really C# and not?           First of all C# is a programming language. It has a power        to develop software. It is a strong language for network and internet        programming. C# has redefined the programming landscape. In addition, C#        designed with the need of C/C++ and Java programmers. Microsoft created it        with Anders Hejlsberg the former Turbo Pascal and Delphi luminary who was        the most prominent Borland staff also Jbuilder team worked together with        him. This new language has been developed specifically with the  NET        framework in mind, and as such is designated to be the .NET developer's        language of choice. One very important matter about C#, it is the first        component oriented programming language. The hot topic at the moment        though is not its relation to C/C++ or Visual basic, but how it compares        to Java and Delphi. Why Delphi? Because Anders has had a prime role during        C# developing. C# inherits some of it's characteristics from C++ and also        is an object oriented language. C# has the functionality of Java, Delphi        and Visual Basic and it a very strong language. You can not reject Delphi        similarity because theoretically Borland was trying to do the same thing        with Borland C++ Builder working on Delphi. But C# has the most        functionality of Java and C++ and theoretical similarity with Delphi and        Visual Basic to use this Java and C++ functionality in a RAD environment.        You may remember properties term from both Delphi and Visual Basic. On the        other hand, when I read "C# combines the high productivity of Microsoft        Visual Basic® with the raw power of C++" I quickly remember Borland's        words for introduction to Borland C++ Builder. What does all mean? C# is        not a clone of Java. C# has more compatibility, functionality and        similarity than Java. Also, C# more similar to C++ as a programming        language. C# stay much closer to C++.           Similarity and difference with C/C++           C# is directly related to C and C++. This is not just an        idea, this is real. As you recall C is a root for C++ and C++ is a        superset of C. C and C++ shares several syntax, library and functionality.        In addition structures, unions, arrays, strings and pointers are most        important and similar functionality for both languages. C# inherits most        of its operators, keywords, and statements directly from C++. Enums are        clearly a meaningful concept in C++. Finally I can clearly say that C# is        the first component-oriented language in the C/C++ family. C# constructors        are very similar with C++ constructors. Like C++, methods are non-virtual        by default, but can be marked as virtual. There is also some difference        between C# and C++, C# supports multiple inheritance of interfaces, but        not of classes. Another difference is destructors, their syntax is same        with C++ but actually they are very different.           Most of the C# basic types have the same names as C++        basic types but they are not really same. For example a char in C# is        equivalent to a wchar_t in C++. If you decide to move from C++ to C# there        are a few things to watch out to include the changes to new, structs,        constructors, and destructors. Creating and using a component (DLL) in C#        is fairly easier than in C++. One more thing, Borland's C++ Builder was a        pure C++ with simple RAD environment of Delphi and VB. C++ Builder was not        a new language. This is one of the biggest differences between C++ Builder        and C#. The CLR (Common Language Runtime) improves runtime interactivity        between program development simplicity, security and portability. However        CLR gives usability for cross-language integration. In addition to all        those CLL has+ a perfect foundation for a rich set of class libraries.                  Conclusion           While there are a number of differences between C++ and        C#, the syntax of C# is not very different from C++ and the transition to        the new language is more easy with RAD environment of .NET. Also  NET's        cross language interoperability can give you the ability to use C++ and C#        together Finally, if you want to use a strong programming language like        C++ with the simplicity of VB and Delphi, than you can use C# powered with        CLR.            &nbsp;     &nbsp;    URL of this page is :  http://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive138.html

                      File Types  Created for Visual C++ Projects   Starter files are automatically generated for your Visual C++ project,  whenever you create one either by using a wizard (such as the MFC AppWizard or  the ActiveX ControlWizard) or one of the icons (such as the Application icon)  available on the  Projects  tab of the  New  dialog.   This topic describes all the types of files that are associated with Visual  C++ projects. The actual files included in your project will depend on the  project type and the options you select when using a wizard.  PROJNAME   represents the name of your project.   What kind of files do you want to know more about?        Project Files and Makefiles        Program or Control source and header files        Precompiled header files        Resource files        Help files        Other file options        Project Files and  Makefiles    PROJNAME .DSW   This is the workspace file used within the development  environment. It organizes all the projects into a single workspace.    PROJNAME .OPT   This is the workspace options file used within the development  environment. It stores all the user options you create for your workspace, so  that each time you open the project workspace it has the look and feel you want  and includes any customizations you have made.    PROJNAME .DSP   This is the project file used within the development  environment. In previous versions of Visual C++ this file extension was MAK. It  stores the information specific to your project. There will be a separate .DSP  file for each project you create. .DSP files are not compatible with NMAKE. You  must export a makefile to build with NMAKE.    PROJNAME .CLW   This file is used by ClassWizard to store information about the  classes in your project    PROJNAME .ODL   This file contains the Object Description Language source code  for a control type library. This file is used by Visual C++ to generate a type  library. The generated library exposes the controls interface to other  Automation clients.    PROJNAME .NCB&nbsp; This is the No compile Browser file. It contains  information generated by the parser which is used by ClassView, WizardBar, and  Component Gallery. If the file is accidentally or deliberately deleted, it is  automatically regenerated.      README.TXT&nbsp; A file (located in the parent directory of the  project) that describes each file in your project using the actual filenames  created by AppWizard or ControlWizard.     Program or  Control Source and Header Files    PROJNAME .H   This is the main include file for the program or DLL. It  contains all global symbols and  #include  directives for other header  files. It derives the  CPrjnameApp  class from  CWinApp  and  declares an  InitInstance  member function. For a control, the   CPrjnameApp  class is derived from  COleControlModule .    PROJNAME .CPP   This file is the main program source file. It creates one object  of the class  CPrjnameApp  (which is derived from  CWinApp ) and  overrides the  InitInstance  member function.   For executables,  CPrjnameApp::InitInstance  does several  things. It registers document templates, which serve as a connection between  documents and views, creates a main frame window, and creates an empty document  (or opens a document if one is specified as a command-line argument to the  application).   For DLLs and ActiveX (formerly OLE) controls,   CProjNameApp::InitInstance  registers the controls object factory  with OLE by calling  COleObjectFactory::RegisterAll  and makes a call to   AfxOLEControlInit . In addition, the member function   CProjNameApp::ExitInstance  is used to unload the control from  memory with a call to  AfxOleControlTerm .   This file also registers and unregisters the control in the Windows  registration database by implementing the  DllRegisterServer  and   DllUnregisterServer  functions.    PROJNAME CTL.H,  PROJNAME CTL.CPP   These files declare and implement the  CProjnameCtrl   class.  CProjnameCtrl  is derived from  COleControl , and  skeleton implementations of some member functions are defined that initialize,  draw, and serialize (load and save) the control. Message, event, and dispatch  maps are also defined.    PROJNAME DLG.CPP,  PROJNAME DLG.H   These files are created if you choose a dialog-based  application. The files derive and implement the dialog class, named   CProjnameDlg , and include skeleton member functions to initialize a  dialog and perform dialog data exchange (DDX). Your About dialog class is also  placed in these files instead of in  PROJNAME .CPP.   DLGPROXY.CPP, DLGPROXY.H   in a dialog-based program, these are the implementation and  header file for the projects Automation proxy class for the main dialog. This  is only used if you have chosen Automation support. This file is one of the  templates provided by MFCAPWZ.DLL.    PROJNAME DOC.CPP,  PROJNAME DOC.H   These files derive and implement the document class, named   CProjnameDoc , and include skeleton member functions to initialize a  document, serialize (save and load) a document, and implement debugging  diagnostics.    PROJNAME SET.H/.CPP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These files are created if you  create a program that supports a database and contains the recordset class.    PROJNAME VIEW.CPP,  PROJNAME VIEW.H   These files derive and implement the view class, named   CProjnameView , that is used to display and print the document data.  The  CProjnameView  class is derived from  CEditView ,   CFormView ,   CRecordView ,   CDaoRecordView ,   CTreeView ,   CListView ,   CRichEditView ,   CScrollView ,  or  CView   and has skeleton member functions to draw the view and implement debugging  diagnostics. If you have enabled support for printing, message-map entries are  added for print, print setup, and print preview command messages. These entries  call the corresponding member functions in the base view class.    PROJNAME PPG.H,  PROJNAME PPG.CPP   These files declare and implement the   CProjnamePropPage  class.  CProjnamePropPage  is derived  from  COlePropertyPage  and a skeleton member function,   DoDataExchange , is provided to implement data exchange and  validation.   IPFRAME.CPP, IPFRAME.H   These files are created if the Mini-Server or Full-Server option  is selected in AppWizards Automation Options page (step 3 of 6). The files  derive and implement the in-place frame window class, named   CInPlaceFrame , used when the server is in-place activated by a container  program.   MAINFRM.CPP, MAINFRM.H   These files derive the  CMainFrame  class from either  CFrameWnd   (for SDI applications) or  CMDIFrameWnd   (for MDI applications). The  CMainFrame  class handles the creation of  toolbar buttons and the status bar, if the corresponding options are selected in  AppWizards Application Options page (step 4 of 6).    CHILDFRM.CPP, CHILDFRM.H   These files derive the  CChildFrame  class from  CMDIChildWnd .  The  CChildFrame  class is used for MDI document frame windows. These files  are always created if you select the MDI option.      Precompiled Header Files   STDAFX.CPP, STDAFX.H   These files are used to build a precompiled header file   PROJNAME .PCH and a precompiled types file STDAFX.OBJ. It is important  that you neither define nor undefine any of the _AFX_NO_XXX macros in stdafx.h.  See the Knowledge Base article "PRB: Problems Occur When Defining _AFX_NO_XXX".  You can find Knowledge Base articles on the MSDN Library CD, or at  http://www.microsoft.com/kb/.      Resource Files    PROJNAME .RC, RESOURCE.H   This is the resource file for the project and its header file.  The resource file contains the default menu definition and accelerator and  string tables for a generic MFC application. It also specifies a default About  box and an icon file (RES\ PROJNAME .ICO). The resource file includes the  file AFXRES.RC for standard Microsoft Foundation class resources. If toolbar  support has been specified as an option, it also specifies the toolbar bitmap  file (RES\TOOLBAR.BMP).    PROJNAME .RC2   The RC2 file can be included at the top of the RC file in a  project.&nbsp; An RC2 file is useful for including resources used by several  different projects.&nbsp; Instead of having to create the same resources several  times for different projects, you can put them in an RC2 file and include the  RC2 file into the main RC file.    PROJNAME .DEF   If the project is for a DLL, this is the module-definition file  for the project. For a control it provides the name and description of the  control, as well as the size of the run-time heap.   RES\ PROJNAME .ICO   This is the icon file for the MFC program or control. This icon  appears when the application is minimized and is also used in the About box.   RES\TOOLBAR.BMP   This bitmap file is used to represent your program or control in  a toolbar or palette. This bitmap is included in the projects resource  file.&nbsp; The initial toolbar and status bar are constructed in the   CMainFrame  class.      Help File Option   MAKEHELP.BAT   This batch file (located in the parent directory) is provided  only for backward compatibility with older projects. In Visual C++ 6.0, custom  build rules are now attached to the .hpj, .cnt and resource.h files, making  makehelp.bat obsolete.   This file is used to create the help file  PROJNAME .HLP for  your program or control.    PROJNAME .HPJ   This file (located in the parent directory) is the Help project  file used by the Help compiler to create your program or controls Help  file.    PROJNAME .RTF   This Help file (located in the HLP subdirectory) contains  template topics that you can edit and information on customizing your HPJ  file.    PROJNAME .CNT   This file provides the structure for the  Contents  window  in Windows  Help .   PRINT.RTF   This file, created if printing support is selected (which it is  by default), describes the printing commands and dialog boxes.   BULLET.BMP   This bitmap is used by standard Help file topics to represent  bulleted lists.      Other File Options    PROJNAME .LIC   This is the user license file. This file must be present in the  same directory as the program or DLL to allow an instance of the control to be  created in a design-time environment. Typically, you will distribute this file  with a control, but your customers will not distribute it.    PROJNAME .REG   This file is created in two cases. (1) You have selected any  Automation server option or an Automation option. (2) You have selected a  document file extension (one of the options available in the  Advanced  Options  dialog). The file demonstrates the kind of registration settings the  framework will set for you.   RES\ITOOLBAR.BMP   This file is created only if you have chosen any Automation  server support and have also chosen the  Dockable Toolbar  option. The file  contains tiled images for the toolbar when the server application is in-place  activated inside a container application. The file is similar to the standard  RES\TOOLBAR.BMP except that many nonserver commands are removed.        &nbsp;

                     &nbsp;  Spring Clean Your Life   by Kathy Gates   Our minds are much like our homes. They both get cluttered with old ideas,  old attitudes, old conversations, old hurts. Both need a routine cleaning out of  stuff that we collected for one reason, and are holding onto out of habit,  neglect, or just sheer willfulness.    Pursuing a simple, sustainable, flexible, happier lifestyle means that you  have to choose it. And that means choosing to lose some other things. It means  getting rid of things that no longer work for you, it means updating the way you  do things, it means freeing up some space for new and exciting opportunities and  challenges.    Just like cleaning your home, a mental Spring Cleaning takes a dedicated  effort, a conscious choice to make changes in your mind the same way you make  changes in your décor.    Here are some ideas to get you started on a Spring Cleaning for your Life:     1. Clean out the anger, hatred, jealousy, and self doubt. If you need to  apologize, bit the bullet and do it. If youre still angry and waiting on an  apology from someone who wont or cant give you one, decide to let it go. Its  not contributing to your life - in fact its contaminating it - so it needs to  go to the junk heap at the curb. Only then can you put something POSITIVE in  its place. Make some room for happiness.    2. Wash away delay and procrastination. Delay and procrastination set you up  for frustration after frustration. Youll find yourself constantly in the past,  trying to catch up, scrambling around trying not to get caught. Is that really  how you want to live? Get into the present! Youre missing your life by living  yesterday over and over.    3. Dust off your attitude, and put on a fresh coat of positive. A positive  attitude begins with gratitude. For just one day, practice giving instead of  taking, practice sharing as much love, help, care, concern, and gratitude as  possible. Itll change your perspective.    4. Throw out misunderstanding, and lack of patience. Sweep out the dirt of  gossip or lies. Open the shades and let in the warmth of friendship. True  friendships, take work, time, energy, thoughtfulness. True friendships require  forgiveness, require understanding. You dont want to be a doormat to anyone,  but you do want to find relationships that are equal and reciprocal. The results  are certainly worth it.    5. Lighten up your thoughts with humor and fun. Yes life is difficult and the  world can be a scary, tiresome place. But in your own world, you are in charge  of every day. You decide what to think about. You decide when to laugh, you  decide what to read, what to listen to, what to think about. Choose to insert  laughter into each day; choose to have a little fun every day.    6. Open the windows of your mind to new ideas and a fresh perspective on  living a happier, better, easier life. Change takes action. Theres no silver  bullet, no magic pill. But if youll open your mind to some different ways of  doing things, if youll try some new habits, if youll work your mind muscles  and your organizational skills in a different way, youll find that youll  create the life that you truly want, not just the one that you end up with.    7. Enjoy the person you are. If you dont like yourself, find out why, and  start working on becoming a person you do enjoy and that others will enjoy also.  The returns will be worth it.

                     Hi Friends,      &nbsp;    I read the article "Your Mindset Determines Your  Life" from the link  http://www.barvin.com/427.aspx .   Its very nice once... read it and njoy....   &nbsp;    Regards,     Prakash      &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Your Mindset Determines Your Life   by Sopan Greene   To keep at the top of your game you have to keep a clear head. You can't  afford to fill up on news and negativity. The world's overflowin' with it and  the only way to be a winner is to be in control of your thoughts.    Your thoughts become words, your words become actions and your actions become  your destiny. Someone else came up with that, but I've always remembered it  because it's true. Our actions show who we truly are and how shallow or deep our  character is.    Where you are today is a direct reflection of the words, thoughts and actions  you took days, months and years ago. No matter how much some people blame their  parents,teachers, where they grew up, television, the government or anything  else, the truth is that nobody got them where they are today but themselves. The  longer we choose to not take responsibility for our lives, the longer we'll  living uninspired lives that we don't love.    I've heard 40 year old adults who complain about their lives and take no  responsiblility for what they've created. Give me a break. If you think you're  on the recieving end of life you're mistaken and too lazy to do anything about  it.    Simply think about the pictures you've seen on TV of people in third world  countries. When I start to get mad about having to stand behind two people in a  line at the grocery store I remind myself that a lot of people don't even know  where their food will come from tonight. This shifts me from anger to gratitude.     The next time you notice yourself getting frustrated or angry about something  in your life I invite you to shift your focus onto what's great in your life. It  doesn't matter if you think you don't have enough money or you're mad at your  dog for chewing up a shoe. Remember how much love you get from having your dog  in the first place and how your weekly earnings are more than some people make  in a month or year.    Keep your focus on what is working - for you and for others. We are bombarded  with negative input all day long. We need to watch what goes in because our  livlihoods depend on what we creatively crank out. Our heads need to be full of  positive inspiration or free space where we can dream.    A recent study revealed that the people who watch the most television news  are the most fearful in our society. Crime has been going down in America for  over a decade, but since the news focuses on it and repeats it over and over, a  lot of people are receiving multiple messages that the world isn't safe. These  people end up being less confident and less successful as a result of being  emotinally paralyzed to a degree by their fears.    Remember the old phrase "garbage in, garbage out"? If you were asked to be on  television based on the person you are today would it be on Jerry Springer or  Oprah?    Yeah, I know. You're probably laughing or snickering right now. I can  practically see that questioning look of disbelief on your face.    You may even think that you wouldn't be on either one. Just imagine that  there's a guy at your door and he's going to put you in a limo right now and you  have to pick one show or the other to be a guest on or you'll be locked in your  house for a month. (It's silly, but you get the point, I want you to get into  it).    There's a definite difference between Oprah guests and Jerry's guests.  Oprah's guests radiate confidence and have taken responsibility for their lives  and have created lemonade out of lemons. Jerry's guests radiate low self esteem  and think they're victims of life. Even worse, they think they have a right to  inflict their negative self-defeating attitude on others.    Oprah people know that they're on the creative end of life. Jerry people  choose to think they're on the receiving end of life. And the truth is that if  that's what they beleive then thats what they get. It's an easy cop out to  settle in life and a lot of folks do it.    It's important to keep a positive mental attitude nomatter what your life is  like because nothing is more important than your thoughts. They determine how  you'll experience the next minute, hour, day, week, year, decade and century.  Rid your life of people and circumstances that don't inspire and enliven you.  Life's simply too short to put up distracting drama and complainers who never  change anything.    We all throw around phrases about how life is too short, but we don't live  that way. Take at least one action today to reaffirm that you're creating a life  you love.    Fire a friend who drains your energy. Read from an autobiography of a person  who inspires you. Turn off the TV and write your goals and values. Take a walk  in nature or with a friend who supports the best in you. Write a note to someone  who has impacted your life in a positive way to let them know you're grateful  for having them in your life. Rub your dog's belly and watch a doggy smile of  ecstasy come out to greet you.    You're building a powerful future. Study successful people and you'll notice  they all surround themselves with other inspired and successful people. Your  life is your show, choose to be an Oprah person and aviod the Jerry people who  show up in your life. Or better yet, treat the Jerry people you meet like they  are the Oprah person buried inside them so we can all shine together.    Let your positive mental attitude infect everyone you meet and we'll all  enjoy better lives.    &nbsp;     &nbsp;

                     I got this material from xml.com    &nbsp;       What is  RDF?     By  Tim  Bray                 Spanish Translation available  here .     This article was first published as " RDF and Metadata " on XML.com  in June 1998. It has been updated by  ILRT's  Dan Brickley, chair of the W3C's  RDF Interest Group, to reflect the growing use of RDF and updates to the  specification since 1998.     The Right Way to Find Things    RDF stands for Resource Description Framework. RDF is built for the Web, but  let's leave the Web behind for now and think about how we find things in the  real world.   Scenario 1: The Library   You're in a library to find books on raising donkeys as pets. In most  libraries these days you'd use the computer lookup system, basically an  electronic version of the old card file. This system allows you to list books by  author, title, subject, and so on. The list includes the date, author, title,  and lots of other useful information, including (most important of all) where  each book is.   Scenario 2: The Video Store   You're in a video store and you want a movie by John Huston. A large modern  video store offers a lookup facility that's similar to the library's. Of course,  the search properties are different (director, actors, and so on) but the  results are more or less the same.   Scenario 3: The Phone Book   You're working late at a customer's office in South Denver, and it seems that  a pizza is essential if work is to continue. Fortunately, every office comes  equipped with a set of Yellow Pages that, when properly used, can lead to quick  pizza delivery.   The Common Thread   What do all these situations have in common, and what differences lie behind  the scenes? First of all, each of these systems is based on  metadata ,  that is, information about information. In each case, you need a piece of  information (the book's location, the video's name, the pizza joint's phone  number) you don't have. In each case, you use metadata (information about  information) to get it.   We're all used to this stuff; metadata ordinarily comes in named chunks  (subject, director, business category) that associate lookup information  ("donkeys", "John Huston", "Pizza, South Side") with the information you're  really after.   Here's a subtle but important point -- in theory, metadata is not really  necessary: you could go through the library one book at a time looking for  donkey books, or through the video store shelves until you found your movie, or  call all the numbers in your area code until you find pizza delivery. But that  would be very wasteful, in fact, it would be stupid. Metadata is the way to  go.    It's All Different Behind the Scenes    In each of our scenarios, we used metadata, and we used it in remarkably  similar ways. Does this mean that the library, the video store, and the phone  company all use the same metadata setup? Of course not. Every library has a  choice among at least two systems for organizing their books, and among many  vendors who will sell them software to do the looking-up. The same is obviously  true for video stores and phone companies.   In fact most such products define their own system of metadata and their own  facilities for storing and managing it. They typically do  not  offer  facilities for sharing or interchanging it. This doesn't cause too much of a  problem, assuming they do a decent job with the user interface. We are  comfortable enough with the general process we call "looking things up" (really,  searching via metadata) that we are able to adapt and use all these different  systems.    Not Just For Searching    The most common daily use of metadata is to aid our discovery of things. But  there are lots of other uses going on behind the scenes. The library and video  store are storing other metadata that you don't see: how often the books and  videos are being used, how much it cost to buy them, where to go for a  replacement, etc. Running a library or a video store would be unthinkable  without metadata. Similarly, the phone company, of course, uses its metadata,  most obviously to  print  the Yellow Pages, but for many other internal  management and administration tasks.    What About the Web?    The Web is a lot like a really  really  big library. There are  millions of things out there, and if you know the URL (in effect a kind of call  number) you can get them. Since the Web has books, movies, and pizza joints, the  number of ways you might want to look things up includes all the things a  library uses, plus all the things the video store uses, plus all the things the  Yellow Pages use, and lots more.   The problem at the moment is that there is hardly any metadata on the Web. So  how do we find things? Mostly by using dumb, brute force techniques. The dumb,  brute force is supplied by the wandering web robots of search engine sites like  Altavista, Infoseek, and Excite. These sites do the equivalent of going through  the library, reading every book, and allowing us to look things up based on the  words in the text. It's not surprising that people complain about search  results, or that the robots are always way behind the growth and change of the  Web.   In fact there is one metadata-based general purpose lookup facility: Yahoo!  Yahoo doesn't use a robot. When you search through Yahoo, you're searching  through human-generated subject categories and site labels. Compared to the  amount of metadata that a library maintains for its books, Yahoo! is pitiful;  but its popularity is clear evidence of the power of (even limited)  metadata.                                           ">         by Tim Bray      Divine Metadata for the Web    People who have thought about these problems, including many librarians and  webmasters, generally agree that the Web urgently needs metadata. What would it  look like? If the Web had an all-powerful Grand Organizing Directorate (at  www.GOD.org), it would think up a set of lookup fields such as Author, Title,  Date, Subject, and so on. The Directorate, being, after all, GOD, would simply  decree that all Web pages start using this divine Metadata, and that would be  that. Of course there would be some details such as how the Web sites ought to  package up and interchange the metadata, and we all know that the Devil is in  the details, but GOD can lick the Devil any day.   In fact, there is no  www.GOD.org . For this  reason, there is no chance that everyone will agree to start using the same  metadata facilities. If libraries, which have existed for hundreds of years,  can't agree on a single standard, there's not much chance that the Web will.   Does this mean that there is no chance for metadata? That everyone is going  to have to build their own lookup keys and values and software, and that we're  going to be stuck using dumb, brute force robots forever?   No. As we observed with our three search scenarios, metadata operations have  an awful lot in common, even when the metadata is different. RDF is an effort to  identify these common threads and provide a way for Web architects to use them  to provide useful Web metadata without divine intervention.    Introducing RDF    Resource Description Framework, as its name implies, is a framework for  describing and interchanging metadata. It is built on the following rules.       A  Resource  is anything that can have a URI; this includes all the    Web's pages, as well as individual elements of an XML document. An example of    a resource is a draft of the document you are now reading and its URL is     http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why.html      A  Property  is a Resource that has a name and can be used as a    property, for example  Author  or  Title . In many    cases, all we really care about is the name; but a Property needs to be a    resource so that it can have its own properties.     A  Statement  consists of the combination of a Resource, a Property,    and a value. These parts are known as the 'subject', 'predicate' and 'object'    of a Statement. An example Statement is "The Author of     http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why.html  is Tim Bray." The value can    just be a string, for example "Tim Bray" in the previous example, or it can be    another resource, for example "The Home-Page of     http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why.html  is     http://www.textuality.com ."     There is a straightforward method for expressing these abstract Properties    in XML, for example:     &lt;rdf:Description about='http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why-RDF.html'&gt; &lt;Author&gt;Tim Bray&lt;/Author&gt;  &lt;Home-Page rdf:resource='http://www.textuality.com' /&gt; &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;     RDF is carefully designed to have the following characteristics.        Independence      Since a Property is a resource, any independent organization (or even    person) can invent them. I can invent one called Author, and you can invent    one called Director (which would only apply to resources that are associated    with movies), and someone else can invent one called Restaurant-Category. This    is necessary since we don't have a GOD to take care of it for us.      Interchange      Since RDF Statements can be converted into XML, they are easy for us to    interchange. This would probably be necessary even if we  did  have a    GOD.      Scalability      RDF statements are simple, three-part records (Resource, Property, value),    so they are easy to handle and look things up by, even in large numbers. The    Web is already big and getting bigger, and we are probably going to have    (literally) billions of these floating around (millions even for a big    Intranet). Scalability is important.      Properties are Resources      Properties can have their own properties and can be found and manipulated    like any other Resource. This is important because there are going to be lots    of them; too many to look at one by one. For example, I might want to know if    anyone out there has defined a Property that describes the genre of a movie,    with values like Comedy, Horror, Romance, and Thriller. I'll need metadata to    help with that.      Values Can Be Resources      For example, most web pages will have a property named Home-Page which    points at the home page of their site. So the values of properties, which    obviously have to include things like title and author's name, also have to    include Resources.      Statements Can Be Resources      Statements can also have properties. Since there's no GOD to provide    useful assertions for all the resources, and since the Web is way too big for    us to provide our own, we're going to need to do lookups based on other    people's metadata (as we do today with Yahoo!). This means that we'll want,    given any Statement such as "The Subject of this Page is Donkeys", to be able    to ask "Who said so? And When?" One useful way to do this would be with    metadata; so Statements will need to have Properties.      Why Not Just Use XML?    XML allows you to invent tags, which may contain both text data and other  tags. XML has a built-in distinction between  element types , for example  the  IMG  element type in HTML, and  elements , for example an  individual  &lt;img src='Madonna.jpg'&gt; ; this corresponds  naturally to the distinction between Properties and Statements. So it seems as  though XML documents should be a natural vehicle for exchanging general purpose  metadata.   XML, however, falls apart on the  Scalability  design goal. There are  two problems:       The order in which elements appear in an XML document is significant and    often very meaningful. This seems highly unnatural in the metadata world. Who    cares whether a movie's Director or Title is listed first, as long as both are    available for lookups? Furthermore, maintaining the correct order of millions    of data items is expensive and difficult, in practice.     XML allows constructions like    &lt;Description&gt;The value of this property contains some text, mixed up with child properties such as its temperature (&lt;Temp&gt;48&lt;/Temp&gt;) and longitude  (&lt;Longt&gt;101&lt;/Longt&gt;). [&amp;Disclaimer;]&lt;/Description&gt;   When you represent general XML documents in  computer memory, you get weird data structures that mix trees, graphs, and  character strings. In general, these are hard to handle in even moderate  amounts, let alone by the billion.   On the other hand, something like XML is an absolutely necessary part of the  solution to RDF's  Interchange  design goal. XML is unequalled as an  exchange format on the Web. But by itself, it doesn't provide what you need in a  metadata framework.                                           ">         by Tim Bray      The Devil is in the Details    The four general rules given above define the central ideas of RDF. It turns  out that it takes quite a lot of abstract terminology and XML syntax to define  them precisely enough that people can write computer programs to process them.  In particular, turning Statements into Resources is quite tricky. It also turns  out that in a (very) few cases, you do need to order your properties, and this  requires quite a bit of syntax.   This article doesn't explain all these details; there are a variety of  excellent resources to be found at  http://www.w3.org/RDF  that are designed to do  just that.    Vocabularies    RDF, as we've seen, provides a model for metadata, and a syntax so that  independent parties can exchange it and use it. What it  doesn't  provide  though is any Properties of its own. RDF doesn't define Author or Title or  Director or Business-Category. That would be a job for GOD, if there were one.  Since there isn't, it's a job for everyone.   It seems unlikely that one Property standing by itself is apt to be very  useful. It is expected that these will come in packages; for example, a set of  basic bibliographic Properties like Author, Title, Date, and so on. Then a more  elaborate set from OCLC and a competing one from the Library of Congress. These  packages are called  Vocabularies ; it's easy to imagine Property  vocabularies describing books, videos, pizza joints, fine wines, mutual funds,  and many other species of Web wildlife.    What RDF Might Mean    The Web is too big for anyone person to stay on top of. In fact, it contains  information about a huge number of subjects, and for most of those subjects  (such as fine wines, home improvement, and cancer therapy), the Web has too much  information for any one person to stay on top of and much of anything else .   This means that opinions, pointers, indexes, and anything that helps people  discover things are going to be commodities of very high value. Nobody thinks  that everyone will use the same vocabulary (nor should they), but with RDF we  can have a marketplace in vocabularies. Anyone can invent them, advertise them,  and sell them. The good (or best-marketed) ones will survive and prosper.  Probably most niches of information will come to be dominated by a small number  of vocabularies, the way that library catalogs are today.   And even among people who are sharing the use of metadata vocabularies,  there's no need to share the same software. RDF makes it possible to use  multiple pieces of software to process the same metadata, and to use a single  piece of software to process (at least in part) many different metadata  vocabularies.   With any luck, this should make the Web more like a library, or a video  store, or a phone book, than it is today.      Getting started with RDF    Since RDF became a W3C Recommendation in February 1999, a number of tools  have been created by developers working with RDF. For an in-depth treatment of  these, consult the  W3C RDF home page . A  number of other listings are available, including  XML.com ,  XMLhack  and Dave Beckett's  RDF Resource Guide .    Developer Community    The main email list for RDF developer discussion is W3C's  RDF Interest Group . A number of other  RDF-related discussion lists exist, including the  Mozilla-RDF  forum (the Mozilla and  Netscape 6 browsers make heavy use of RDF). More recently, the  RDF-Logic  list has  been  announced ,  providing a forum for the discussion of formal, logic-based approaches to  knowledge representation for the Web. DARPA's  DAML  (DARPA Agent Markup Language) initiative  uses the RDF-Logic list for discussions and announcements.   The RDF developer community is rather diverse, which is reflected in the  nature of online discussions on the RDF lists. While one strand of RDF  development is concerned with highly formal topics (RDF-Logic, DAML and so on),  others are busy deploying simpler, more pragmatic applications for Web-based  content and metadata syndication. All these themes meet (sometimes productively,  sometimes confusingly) on the RDF Interest Group list, but they also typically  each have a dedicated email list. For example, the  RSS-DEV  group has produced the   RDF Site Summary (RSS) 1.0  Specification,  which provides an RDF-based channel format, designed for interoperability with  high level vocabularies such as  Dublin Core  as  well as a variety of more application-specific RDF vocabularies.   Notes on Update (Dan Brickley)   This update to the 1998 article serves only to synchronize it with recent RDF  terminology. Since this document was first published, the  W3C  has published the  Model and Syntax  specification as  a Recommendation.   I have updated the markup example to use current RDF 1.0 syntax. There have  also been some terminology changes: 'PropertyType' became 'Property', 'Property'  became 'Statement'. I have also added a brief mention of  subject/predicate/object terminology, and lowercased a few mentions 'Value'  (since rdf:object replaced rdf:value for talking about the object of a  statement).

       A Nice anectode on Love From Swami Vivekananda   I once had a friend who grew to be very close to me. Once when we were sitting at the edge of a swimming pool, she filled the palm of her hand with a little water and held it before me, and said this: "You see this water carefully contained on my hand? It symbolizes Love."   This was how I saw it: "As long as you keep your hand caringly open and allow it to remain there, it will always be there. However, if you attempt to close your fingers around it and try to possess it, it will spill through the first cracks it finds. This is the greatest mistake that people do when they meet, love,......they try to possess it, they demand, they expect... and just like the water spilling out of your hand, Love will retreat from you.  For love is meant to be free, you cannot change its nature. If there are people you love, allow them to be free beings. Give and don't expect. Advise, but don't order. Ask, but never demand. It might sound simple, but it is a lesson that may take a lifetime to truly practice. It is the secret to true love. To truly practice it, you must sincerely feel no expectations from those who you love, and yet an unconditional caring.

       Problem: It is so easy to speak negatively when we do not like something about someone.  Sometimes we do react to the situation and get angry. We continue to find fault with that person.  The person too responds negatively to our negative thoughts.  And so there is no hope of creating a positive relationship.   Solution: When something goes wrong in any relationship, the first thing I need to do is to keep my mind calm and cool.  When I do this, I will not be caught up with the negativity of the situation or the negative trait of the person at that time, but I will be able to see something beautiful in that person. I will be able to appreciate and connect to the uniqueness of that person, thus creating space for rebuilding that relationship.

       Problem: When we think we know the truth and we are truthful, we generally tend to also have arrogance of that truth. This is why we argue and try to prove our point to the other person. We are not able to see what the other person has to say and continue to put forth our own idea or perspective. This sometimes leads to futile arguments and conflicts.  Solution: When I am truthful, I also have humility. With humility I am able to put forth my idea to the other person in a detached way. The truth in me will enable me to understand the other person accurately and will keep me open to see his point of view too. This naturally will get my point across without much of difficulty, as the other person is also able to see my point of view.

       Are in regular touch with people?  How do people perceive you? Do they think that you care for them so that they care for you? Are you a person who thinks of others only when you want them or do you nurture and maintain healthy relationship with others on a regular basis?  I am sure that you would have come across people who contact  - rather renew their contact with you!  - only when they want some thing from you?  What did you think about them?   This is how you will project yourself with them when you do the same thing.  Your emotional bondage with others will decide how much they value your association. Make it a habit to get genuinely interested in others. The best way to do this is to greet people on their birth day and wedding days. Avoid the `ritualistic' New Year cards. You know and they know that in many cases it is the `flavour of the month'. Make it a practice to make a no agenda telephone call at a time you have nothing to ask for from the other person. If your friends have a special occasion, make it a practice to call on them. If you come across an information which you feel will be useful to some one, send the same with a small note?  Building a positive image is difficult!

       Problem: When someone disbelieves me I usually tend to argue back and try to prove my point to the others but find that I am not able to convince them. Yet I find that the more I talk the less I am listened to. And I only end up getting frustrated.  Solution: When someone challenges the truth of my words, I need to check within myself if there is something that I can correct or learn. When I learn to do this, instead of being stubborn with what I have to say or blaming others, I find it easy to tolerate.

       The method to receive help is to have courage.  Problem:Many times when involved in something difficult, we begin to look for help from people even before we have started. Prayer is also one method which we rely on and wish for things to work our way. But not always do we find the help coming that is required. So we tend to get disheartened and maybe even give up trying altogether.  Solution:The simple way to receive help is to first have courage. When I first take a step of courage using the force of all my resources, I automatically find others taking help from that too. For having moved one step ahead, I get the help from the resources available, from the people around, God himself & me. I thus recognize and make use of all the help that is coming my way. So I never need to beg for help, but find help coming my way automatically.  The one who is able to be happy with the self is the one who is able to make others happy too.  Problem:Most of our time goes into pleasing others and making them happy.&nbsp; Yet we find that not always are people happy with us.&nbsp; Many times, instead of our sincere efforts to contribute to others, they do not appreciate what we have done.&nbsp; On the contrary, they might also criticise us and point out some shortcoming.&nbsp; Since all our effort has been to please others, we tend to get disheartened and upset with this kind of criticism.  Solution:Whatever I do is for myself.&nbsp; Even the contribution that I make is for myself.&nbsp; When I recognise this fact, I will never do anything just to please others, but will make effort to bring happiness to myself.&nbsp; When I am content with the effort that I put in, I will never be dependent on others' recognition of my effort.&nbsp; So I am able to enjoy everything and continue putting in more effort.&nbsp; The more I am content, others too will start appreciating my sincere effort.

       Our actions are based on the seeking of results. We are engaged in a process of causation, trying to produce one thing through another. Such action is, in a sense, dishonest. We are doing one thing only to arrive at something else. The result is more important than our regard for what we are actually doing.  We seldom do anything for its own sake. Our action is not direct and present. It follows an ulterior motivation and a looking to the future. Our action works through time, which is the past and the future, and the denial of the present that is awareness.  Action that seeks a result, therefore, creates bondage to time. It attaches us to the stream of causation, in which we ourselves, becoming part of the process, can be moved, influenced and mani-pulated according to that which we seek. Matter, time, space and causation are ultimately the same. We see matter,- an inert or raw material to be used, according to our seeking of results.  To seek results is to create matter, to turn things into manipulatable objects. For example, if I desire to become a political leader, I must learn how to use the masses of people in order to give me power and influence. I must turn them into a tool and mould them like clay according to my ambition, which is exactly what most of our leaders attempt. In that seeking of results, I turn living human beings into mere instruments for arriving at what I want. Were I not seeking anything, I could look at people directly as human beings. When we see others as human beings, as ourselves, we cannot manipulate them. A future based upon the past - the past being our desire and the future its fulfilment - binds us to a mentality of absence and want. Turning the world (which is also our inner-most self) into an object lienates us and creates division in space. The seeking of results binds us to time, space and karma, not as some metaphysical theory but as a psychological fact. It creates our false world-idea based upon the ego, the work of sorrow and confusion or samsara that is the denial of our true self and being.  From the ego, which is the central focus of the ignorant, the original fissure in consciousness between self and other, comes our entire bondage to time, space and causation. Apart from the seeking of results, all life is spiritual, sacred or nirvanic - a pure and inviolable existence. Knowledge and ignorance are opposites - they are contrary to each other. Dwelling in the midst of ignorance, thinking themselves to be wise, the foolish totter like the blindfolded led by the blindfolded. The higher goal does not appeal to these heedless children, deluded by the material world, says the Katha Upanishad.  The Creator opened the gates of the senses to look without, not to see the inner Self.  Only a rare sage with his eye turned within, desiring immortality, sees the inner self. The childish follow after outer desires and enter into the noose extended by death. Once results cease to matter and ignorance is replaced by knowledge, the inner self becomes evident, and all bondage ceases. There is only a pure transformation, free of ego. Action is no longer predicated on the result; action becomes direct and present - it is no longer restrictive.

       The ability to take responsibility for one's actions is to be conscious of the growth of the self   Problem: It is so easy to blame others and situations, for whatever is happening in our lives. We constantly look for excuses and so we are not able to do anything for our own growth. So there is not a constant experience of growth. Life becomes a constant struggle as I begin to feel bound by the situations.   Solution: When I am conscious of my own growth I am able to be aware of my own thoughts, feelings and emotions and to understand how they influence my behaviour. Then I am able to take responsibility for my own choices and actions. Thus I begin to experience freedom not feeling bound by any situation.

       A young man was getting ready to graduate college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.  As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation his father called him into his private study. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Bhagwad Geeta. Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said, "With all your money you give me just a Book?" and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.  He never contacted his father again for long long time.  Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and wonderful family, but realized his father must be very old by now, and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care things.  When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search his father's important papers and saw the still new Bhagwad Geeta, just as he had left it years ago. With tears, he opened the holy book and began to turn the pages. As he read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the holy book. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired.  On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words ..PAID IN FULL.  How many times do we miss GOD's blessings because they are not packaged as we expected?

       One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was hungry.  He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door.  Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly, and then asked, How much do I owe you?"  "You don't owe me anything," she replied. "Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness."  He said..... "Then I thank you from my heart."  As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit.  Many years later that same young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease.  Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.  Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once.  He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to her case.  After a long struggle, the battle was won.  Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally she looked, and something caught  her attention on the side of the bill. She read these words.....  "Paid in full with one glass of milk" (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly.  Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: "Thank You, God, that Your love has spread broad through human hearts and hands."  There's a saying which goes something like this: Bread cast on the waters comes back to you. The good deed you do today may benefit you or someone you love at the least expected time. If you never see the deed again at least  you will have made the world a better place - And, after all, isn't that  what life is all about?
