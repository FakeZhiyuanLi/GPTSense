      Unbeknownst to me, the "McGee and Me!" series has it's own website!  http://www.mcgeeandme.com  No info on the upcoming DVD's there, but it gives you a good idea of what the show was about.  And stay tuned for my new series "Reviews of Movie's I Haven't Seen, and Won't Probably See, But Know Suck". Or "RMIHSWPSKS" for short.  Next time: "The Day After Tomarrow"

      ..now it's just another left wing mouthpiece.  5 years or so ago, their humor was pretty balanced. Oh sure, they'd rip conservatives here and there, but you got the feeling they had one or two on the staff given the searing accuracy of the "satire".  Now, apparently, they have fired everyone with even a moderately conservative viewpoint and sneak in little political barbs all in the name of "satire". It's extremely insidious and that makes it hard to clarify.  Incidentally, I don't think anyone even knows what "satire" is anymore. The people who say something extreme and then say "oh but it's satire" are almost always the ones who have no concept of it anyway.  They also have "The Onion AV Club". The mistake they make there is thinking that anyone actually cares about the Onion writers' opinions on music and movies. Typical of all self-righteous dorks they love to review weird underground bands and movies and heap praises upon them-and of course scorn anything even remotely mainstream.  I mean who are they fooling there? They are a bunch of 32 year olds who make up funny newspaper articles. Having them comment "seriously" on arts and entertainment makes about as much sense as having Carrot Top weigh in on the situation in the Middle East.

      Well, Minnesota's most beloved nancy-boy is apparently making a big comeback.  No, not Kevin Sorbo—it's PRINCE!  Or the artist formerly known as the artist formerly known as PRINCE!  Let me preface this all by saying PRINCE is a very talented musician-certainly more talented than I am. When he first became known in the late 1970's many thought he was the next Hendrix. Even beyond that though, he was a musical phenom. He wrote, arranged and produced his own music;he could play and play well the guitar, bass, keyboards, drums AND he could sing. Not only that, this kid was from Minnesota, a state which at that time was known primarily for Hubert H. Humphrey and deadly 12 foot Mosquitos.  So certainly PRINCE is and was a capable musician...  Yes, he is talented but so was Hitler.  And therin lies the problem.  No, I'm not equating the accomplishments of PRINCE with the nefarious deeds of Hitler, I simply mean that "talent" alone doesn't give you any merit.  I mean listen to most any Prince album and what do you hear? Complex chord changes, lydian mode scale structure, and intricate three level harmony?  Heck no, you hear Prince whooping and cooing, a bunch of techno drumbeats, lo-fi squeaks and pops and synthisizers up the heehaw. Oh and dirty dirty lyrics. Lots of dirty things, things that would make even sailors and stable boys blush.  Now I guess, for Prince's latest tour his going back to his "roots" with guitars and simplified arrangments.  However even this is pretty much a dead end for those of us searching for Prince's musical genius as he's still thrusting his crotch out, yelping and employing 35 gyrating semi-nude dancers.Yes the music has been "stripped down" but not in the way that you think.  What's my point? My point is that Prince, to me anyway, is a huge waste of talent. He's a great guitar player but he covers over it with overproduced loops and samples. He's a great singer but instead of belting out soulfull tunes he chirps, squeaks and whoops. He's a great songwriter but he spends all of his time changing his name, buying poofy shirts and oiling his thighs.  The man is a weirdo— he's like a more subdued, effete & saavy Michael Jackson.  PRINCE isn't for me. I'll stick with Gordon Lightfoot thankyouverymuch.

      Twins catcher/dh hit a total clutch pinch-hit grand salami today to help the Twins defeat the pathetic-canuck-fake-baseball-team-still play on AstroTurf®-Blue Jay weenies.  Down 5-2 with the bases juiced and Lecroy comes through, unbelievable.  This is why the Twins are a good baseball team. Never say die, and play to the last out. Oh, yeah and total clutch hits help too.  And I'm sick of people saying the White Sox are a superior team. It seems like we've been hearing that for 3 years now—even after the Twins have won two division championships and continued to school the Sox.  Well that ends now. The Twins are easily the best team in the AL central and currently have the 2nd best record in all of baseball. The Sox still can't play with any kind of consistancy. (They'll win one game 10-0 and then lose two games 4-3 and 5-1).  Oh yeah and we've been without 2-4 starters throughout the whole first 6 weeks of the season.

      "We believe that what we put into our bodies matters; food feeds our souls, lifts our spirits, nourishes and sustains us. That's why we created LUNA, the blissfully good, whole nutrition bar for women. In just 180 calories, LUNA meets many of the specific nutritional requirements women need everyday to maintain active lifestyles. Join us in healthy, joyous living!"  This is what it says on the LUNA bar wrapper that Jake Bird sold me. LUNA, in case you didn't know, is "The Whole Nutrition Bar for Women."  My experiment today is to see what happens when a guy eats "a whole nutrition bar for women." Will my voice change? Will I experience mood swings? Will I get pregnant?  While it is unlikely that I will get pregnant simply from eating a glorified granola bar, the line about "specific nutritional requirements" does make me curious. Are there special vitamins and minerals only women can digest?  We shall soon find out as soon as I figure out how to open this wrapper...  Ah, yes there. This specific LUNA bar is called "Key Lime Pie." I'm a big fan of all things Key Lime so this should be a good test of LUNA's flavor relevancy.  The top 5 ingredients of a LUNA bar are:  1. Something called LunaPro™; which sounds more like a type of synthetic motor oil to me...LunaPro contains Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour and Malt Extract)  2. Next we have rolled oats. Rolled in what I might ask? Mud? Olive oil? Human feces? The wrapper does not say...  3. Soy Protein Isolate. This is weird because the LunaPro™ has Soy Protein Isolate in it too, which means I'm going to be ingesting a lot of Soy Protein Isolate and I don't even know what it is.  4. Organic Roasted Soybeans. Now we are getting into some familar territory here. I like roasted peanuts, so roasted soybeans can't be much different. Or they could be very different and I could turn into a women or maybe even die.  5.  Lastly we have Soy Flour. So that's flour made up from soy beans.  Bascially this LUNA bar is comprised of stuff left in the silo long after the harvest is over and then flavored with lime.  The wrapper is open and I'm ready to examine the bar.  The bar looks vaguely like a rice crispy bar and has some sort of icing running along the bottom.  It smells like a used horse blanket dipped in Pine-Sol.  I prepare to bite in, knowing that the $1.75 I spent on this stupid thing could be money well spent, or simply another failed experiment.  Here we go...  Oh boy is this thing awful.  First of all it tastes nothing like key lime.  Secondly it's extremely heavy and dense—it's like eating a damp washcloth.  Thirdly it has a terrible NutraSweety aftertaste that gives you the sensation of sucking on a dryer sheet.  And lastly, the weird "nutrional requirements for women" have taken effect and I now have breasts. (Just kidding there, haha).  But I AM very irrational, prone to mood swings and I like to talk behind people's backs. Haha, kidding again.  I'm scared to take another bite but here goes...  Even worse than the first, my taste buds desperately seeking some sort of pleasing flavor to pacify themselves with...  On a scale of 1 to 5 I rate this LUNA bar a 1. It's certainly not edible for anyone—man, woman or beast. It make be useful for scrubbing toliets or removing baked in food on pans. The jury is still out on that however. Stay tuned.

      Right now I'm watching the movie "Krull".  Not to be confused with the 1997 Kevin Sorbo vehicle "Kull-The Conqueror".  "Krull" was released a full decade before "Kull" and neither movie has much in common other than that they both feature numerous oily guys swinging swords. Another thing "Krull" has in common with "Kull" is that it's not a very good movie.  "Krull" was directed by the great Peter Yates, the master behind such movie classics as "For Pete's Sake" and "Mother, Jugs & Speed" which he won a record breaking 17 Oscars for—or not, either way I just ate a burrito.  The movie stars Ken Marshall, Lysette Anthony, Freddie Jones AND Francesca Annis. It's hard to imagine a time when these people were unknown actors and not the household names they are now. It's hard to imagine this, largely because these people continue to be unknown actors and are in no way household names now.  Well, I take that back, I may have heard my roommate say "Francesca Annis" sometime last November, but he may have been saying "I need a Fresca, ass."  The one actor you may recognize would be the great Liam Neeson. He holds his own in small supporting role, looking all Qui-Gonny and delivering some of the worst dialogue ever recorded onto celluloid film.  The story deals with the planet of Krull and it's two mighty kingdoms. A young prince named Colwyn "sets out on a daring journey to rescue his young bride who is held captive by the Beast®". If that sounds like a phrase taken from the back of the "Krull" VHS box, that's because it is a phrase taken from the back of the "Krull" VHS box.  Anyway, Prince Colwyn has to find the magical and legendary "Glaive". An odd, five-bladed boomerang doo-hickey with magical, mystical, laserlike properties, blah, blah, blah.  I'm not sure what happens because the movie isn't even half over yet, but frankly I don't care. I'm not sure the producers even cared, and it's pretty clear audiences didn't care either because the movie grossed approximately $11 worldwide (adjusted for inflation).  It's odd that the movie didn't do better at the box office, given the media frenzy that surrounded "Krull." Who can forget the action figures, breakfast cereals and McKrullburgers? Who can forget  "The Tonight Show" on 7/28/87 when that spotted lemur from the San Diego zoo took a leak on Freddie Jones's head? And certainly no one can forget the "A-Ha" Dance remix of the the "Krull" theme, so popular at the discoteque? It was a fun and carefree time.  Oh well, "Krull" succeeds at one thing in that Kevin Sorbo is nowhere to be seen.

      I've just been informed that "McGee & Me!" is coming to DVD this July! All 12 episodes will be packaged by three's in four different volumes! Oh joy!  If you were a good clean Christian kid between the ages of 7-12 in 1989-1993 "McGee & Me!" was pretty much the coolest thing ever.  It was the saga of a young man name Nicholas Martin who had a penchant for drawing cartoons. One day his latest cartoon, McGee, magically comes to life and teaches Nick various Christian values.  McGee was sort of a combination of Bart Simpson and that creepy little green martian dude who would show up on "The Flintstones" once in a while.  Clearly the best episode was episode 5: "Twister & Shout." In this one, Nick, his sisters and his best friend are home alone during a terrifying tornado. I saw this one when I was like 9 and it was basically like watching "Star Wars" for the first time. It scared and intrigued me all at the same time.  Other great episodes include episode 4: "Skate Expectations" which featured a really rad skateboard race and episode 8: "Take Me Out of the Ballgame", which featured Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser! Holy crap! There was also episode 7: "Do the Bright Thing" which was kind of the "experimental" "McGee and Me!" episode. It featured Dick Van Patten and most of it took place INSIDE Nick's head. Trippy!  The later episodes 10-12 were dubbed "The New Adventures" and were supposed to deal with more "teen" type issues. Needless to say they weren't as good but certainly had there moments.  The "McGee & Me!" Saga:  Episode 1: The Big Lie Episode 2: A Star in the Breaking Episode 3: The Not-So Great Escape Episode 4: Skate Expectations Episode 5: Twister & Shout Episode 6: Back to the Drawing Board Episode 7: Do the Bright Thing Episode 8: Take Me Out of the Ballgame Episode 9: 'Twas the Fight Before Christmas Episode 10: In the Nick of Time Episode 11: The Blunder Years Episode 12: Beauty in the Least

      Now the latest charge is that we intimidated some prisoners with "scary dogs."  This is in addition to "calling them gay" and "throwing water at them." That's not abuse, that's recess.  Meanwhile they are cutting the heads off of civilians. Am I the only one who cares about this?  Oh, and the charges of "rape" and "sodomy" are largely unconfirmed.  In fact the only people bringing those abuses up are Democrats who are now against the war. Surprise Surprise. So this is basically a non-issue.

      Nick Berg, an American civilian who, out of his own goodwill was trying to help the Iraqi's rebuild their pathetic country, was beheaded recently in an act of retailiation to the "torture" Iraqi prisoners have been receiving.  Torture which includes: 1. Pouring cold water on prisoners 2. Calling them "gay" 3. Assorted things that you would see at any college hazing  This shows you how screwed up our enemy is. That beheading a civilian equates to "mistreating" a surrendered soldier. We send crews of people over to rebuild their infurstructure and they slaughter them and dance on their charred bodies (see FALLUJAH).  Is the mistreatment of surrendered prisoners wrong? Absolutely. But I've got news for you. This kind of thing goes on in every war. You don't think hundreds of surrendering Germans were shot on sight or "mistreated" simply because the GI's didn't want the men who had just killed their buddies on the beach loafing around and taking their rations? This is war. It's ugly, and this crap happens.  Yes we should follow the Geneva Convention to a "T", but isn't their something we can do now short of apologizing to the enemy?

      That's right, last night I sat next to Mike Nawrocki, known to most people as a writer/director and co-founder of VeggieTales®. I ran into him at the Hard Rock Cafe' here at CBA-Atlanta. Incidentally he's the voice of Larry the Cucumber.  Big Idea® (the company that produces "VeggieTales") had a really horrible year last year, going bankrupt but were thankfully picked up by another company (Creative Media). They made some bad business decisions and also got screwed over in a lawsuit by a Marxist Feminazi female judge from Texas. Let's hear it for female judges screwing over creative upstart Christian companies that actually are successfully making something creative! She was probably on her period...  But from talking with Mike, I understand that the company that bought them is really cool and is investing alot into VeggieTales®. They will be moving their offices to Nashville (from Chicago-land) and already have 4 or 5 projects lined up for the next couple of years.  It was neat talking to him, about animation, business, the Chicago Cubs, etc—smart stuff. Rather than doing what most people who know of VeggieTales® must do when they meet the creators (sing a butchered version of "The Hairbrush Song" or ask them to talk like vegetables or something). Both Mike and his partner Phil Vischer attended Crown College back in the mid-80's, so there was even a Minnesota connection there. Incidentally, they both got kicked out of Crown College for not attending chapel enough, hahahaha.  I did do my impression of a character I have for them called "Harry Carrot", so I did make somewhat of an ass of myself (hey, it's ME!). Incidentally "Harry Carrot" talks like a certain famous Chicago Cubs broadcaster...  But they were all cool, and Mike even gave me his business card and I gave him mine, so who knows, maybe I'll finally fulfill one of my lifetime dreams of doing voice-over/impression work!

      I'm hearing alot about the "emergent church" or the "emerging generation." It's proponents like to use big strange words like "holistic" and "missional" and downplay words like "evangelical" and,  I don't know, "Christian" and "Biblical."  Not that I accuse the Emergent® big-wigs of anything untoward. I don't doubt the sincerity of their faith or the assuredness of their salvation, it's that I'm simply cautious of this whole movement in the church right now to be "relevant" and "holistic" and all those other silly words. Are we being "relevant" at the expense of being evangelical? I guess this had been the question since the 1st Nicean council so it's nothing really new...  "Evangelical" itself seems to be a dirty word among the emergent crowd...  Additionally, I have had my doubts about some of the leaders of these "emerging" churches at least here locally. Outside of church, as I have covertly observed, some of them are, well to put it bluntly, total assholes. And I mean that in the most honorable way possible...  I'm all for making Christianity "relevant" to the world, working to reconcile among the denominations, using art and poetry to worship God and draw people to him. That's all fine and dandy. But are we losing something in our quest to make Christianity popular? Is Christianity really supposed to be "popular"? Is the very symbol of our faith, the cross, not offensive to the world? Did Paul not tell us that the "world will hate you..."?  These are questions that all the poetry readings, interpretive dances and trendy couch venues are ill-equipped to answer...

      Well, the 1986 Disney classic  urlLink "Flight of the Navigator"  has finally been released to DVD. I recently had the privilage to re-watch it and let me tell you, it's as good as you remember it.  If you haven't seen it, it's the tale of a young man named David Freeman who is taken on a time-traveling voyage via alien spacecraft. He zips from 1978 to "present day" 1986. The catch is that he HASN'T AGED A DAY. As the authorities try to unravel the mystery, David is led to his TRUE DESTINY (which I won't spoil here). All of the stuff before David's triuphant christening as the NAVIGATOR happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie.  I forgot just how short it is, barely clocking in at 90 minutes (including credits) it breezes from one fantastical sequence to the next. I wanted to see more development between David and his Older/Younger 1986 Edition brother, more scenes involving David and the evil NASA scientists, and maybe even a tender moment between David and RALF (Sarah Jessica Parker's pet robot!)  Oh well, when you're a kid watching this you don't care about things like "character development" and "subtext" and "plot". You just want to see a cool morphing spaceship.  As a kid my favorite line from the movie (by far) was when David and Max (the alien spaceships sentient robot captain) fly past the Golden Gate Bridge. Max (voiced by a pre-pervert Paul Reubens) quips "Rice-a-roni® the San Francisco Treat. Ha Ha." Listening to that line now, I find it utterly lame, but as a 8 year old kid watching this on the Wonderful World of Disney (where it aired approxamately 350,000 times between January 1987 and November 1990) I thought it was the single funniest thing ever said anywhere.  My one complaint is the DVD's utter lack of extra material. Don't patronize me, "English and Spanish Subtitles" are NOT a special feature, nor are "Scene Selections" or "Motion Menus". This is like calling the cigarette lighter in your Honda a "Value-add-on."

      With Reagan's passing and the increased coverage of his legacy dominating many a newspaper and internet site, I've been doing some of my own research on our 40th President's accomplishments and achievements. I've been reading speeches, brief bios and synopsis, as well as watching video clips of his public apperances and remarks.  What's striking to me is how calm and rational the man was. He was a conservative in the strongest sense of the world; a "speak softly but carry a big stick" type if there ever was one. He believed in a strong military, free markets and social conservatism. Yet his approach was soft, calm and rational, which are words the media rarely uses to describe hardline right-wingers.  Here's a man who called the Soviet Union for what it was-an "Evil Empire." He demanded that the 2nd largest Super Power "tear down this wall." He fought off communist aggressors in South America, and did all he could to quell the expansion of the most despotic, wicked socioeconomic system ever devised. Yet he, a supposed crazy dangerous conservative, did more for nuclear disarmament with the INF treaty than any President before or since.  Liberals even liked him. The didn't vote for him or support any of his policies but couldn't bring themselves to hate the Gipper. In retrospect now they'll say the "never liked him", but who cares what @$$holes like Greg Palast think?  Our current President would be wise to learn from Reagan. I think W and Ron have a lot in common. They both have had to lead their citizenry through a very complicated and tricky war (what did Clinton have? Kosovo?) and they both have been, I think, largely misunderstood.  W needs to learn to give Americans the larger perspective here. Reagan didn't simply call the USSR our "enemy" or "the other superpower that we disagree with" or even "a bad place to live", no he called them "an evil empire".  What we are dealing with in the middle east is not "diverse cultures" or "an alternative lifestyle", it's people who have no qualms about cutting the heads off civilians. Reagan would have seen that distinction and made it clear from the beginning.

      ...that the Minnesota Twins couldn't beat a Little League team right now. They are being absolutely schooled by 17 year old KC pitchers, and *gasp* guys like Mark Hendrickson and some fruit named "Wechter" from the Devil Rays.  The Twins played horribly in the first half last year, and it was a catalyst named Shannon Stewart who saved the season for the Twins. He's hurt right now, and maybe that's why the Twins aren't getting any hits.  I am about ready to give up on the Koskie/Mientikiewicz/Guzman Twins and look to the future for the Mauer/Mourneau/Restovich Twins. Our current Twins are certainly good and have been good for the past 3 years. But let's face it, they are good enough to have a winning season and maybe win their division but that's about it. This is clearly not a World Series team. Or even the kind of dominating team Devil Ray or Royal players should fear.  A World Series caliber team would score 8 runs of Devil Ray pitching in the first 5 innings. This team can barely manage 2.  So go to the Dome to see Mauer. Even if the Twins lose every game from here on out, Mauer is worth your $14 Upper Club ticket.

      I don't think I even need to back this statement up, but I will anyway.   He accuses the President of going to war on "faulty" evidence?   WTF? Mass graves? Saddam using WMD's on HIS OWN people? The fact that U.N. Weapons Inspectors (not exactly bastions of republicanism) weren't allowed to inspect Iraq fully (gee, think he was hiding something)?   Anyway, even if the evidence was "faulty", YOU John Kerry, voted for the war based on that evidence! Oh, and then you voted later to not give more money and resources to the troops, which is actually more than just hypocritical, it's also uh, EVIL.   Send to troops into battle and then not giving them what they need to win? Ring a bell? It was called Vietnam, and it's the #1 reason we lost that war. Thank you, Democratic congress.   John Kerry isn't even a good liberal. Or maybe he is? He's completely inconsistent, a trait more and more visible in the left.

      Well, your friendly, boneheaded, moronic, anti-freedom Bloomington city council is the first to implement a city-wide ban on smoking.  Next will be a city-wide ban on "fatty foods", a city-wide ban on "cell phone driving", and then a city-wide ban on things that are "fun and good."  Granted, smoking is really stupid. But so are a lot of things we don't ban. Recycling is stupid and a waste of human energy, but I don't see the Bloomington police cracking the heads of Green party members (although they should, for other reasons). Alcohol is generally very stupid. Flavored coffee drinks are stupid and will give you kidney stones.  So if you see one of the Bloomington city council members walking down your street (you'll know them by their crooked smile and the smell of sulphur) go ahead and punch them in the face. Okay maybe dont' do that. Throw a shoe at them or something. Or maybe just do what the anti-war protestors are doing: point at them and scream "Fascist! Fascist! Fascist!" over and over again.

      Well, I finally did it.  I saw "Farenheit 9-11".  Of course I'm the last person who'd want to put yet still more money into the coffers of one Michael Moore, so I paid for "The Notebook" (the closest to "Farenheits" scheduled time) and entered the theater for "Farenheit 9-11" with smuggled candy in shorts.  I should have smuggled tissues and General Foods International instead and gone with the tearjerkin' melodrama...  "Farenheit 9-11" is an exercise in incompetence. A diatribe of amoral hyperbolic buffoonery. And 2 hour piece of Left-Wing anti-american pornography.  The juxtaposition of imagery is done in such an overcharged, bang-bang pot-shot way that you're left wondering what the crap you just saw, and why.  Technically the film is a mess, and proves to me that the Cannes Film Festival panel's love of this film on it's "technical merits" is utter hogwash. Those dirty film loving Frogs liked this because it tears Bush a new cornhole. It is no "technical acheivement", is not tightly edited at all, and drags from one tenuous explanation to the next.   All documentaries, indeed all FILMS are about manipulating emotions. That's the heartbeat of the medium and I don't pretend it otherwise. But this movie, manipulates you and you KNOW you're being manipulated the whole time. It's the film equivalent of breaking up with your 2 week girlfriend in the 7th grade. You're being pulled and prodded the whole time, but you go with it anyway, in this case because you are a) a frothing liberal who gets almost sexually excited by anyone even moderately to the right looking like an ass or b) you're of the more right-persuasion and you've become mesmerized by the continuing idiocy of the liberal "mind".  Moore's assumption, as I understand it, is this:  -George W. Bush was responsible for 9-11. He was lax with stopping terrorism, and indeed is a friend of the Bin Ladens so he wouldn't do anything anyway. The only reason we are in Iraq is because of oil and oil is bad, very, very bad. George Bush likes it when American soldiers die because that will make his stock rise .6 points. George W. Bush is an idiot who dosen't take things seriously. Oh but wait, he's an idiot who takes things too seriously now with his homeland security and "Patriot Acts". George Bush and his cabinet have to get "made up" before events. This makes them stupid and means they like it when Iraqi babies die. The current War is apparently the first war in history where soldiers have died and also the first where civilians have died. When a war is "over" that means everything is peaches and roses and sunshine and their should be no more explosions. If there are that means Bush is a dirty liar and he eats Iraqi babies-  Okay I made that last line up...  That above paragraph may seem quite convulouted, incongrouous and random. Which is also a perfect description of "Farenheit 9-11".  It's all so extremely idiotic. Bush is a "friend" of the Bin Laden's in that he owned a company, that worked with a guy who knew the Bin Laden's, one of who blow up the World Trade Center. (Nevermind the Bin-Ladens have shunned Osama and have nothing to do with him, nor have they in 15 years-oh except 4 of them may or may not have gone to a Bin-Laden family wedding he was at in 2000) So in short Bush killed all those people on 9-11. Bullshit. Anything involving oil is automatically dirty and crooked? Like it or not, oil makes the world go around. Bush is an rich oil guy. Big flipping deal. Oil is a big complex industry and is, what a shock, run big big complex oraganizations. You can't have Mom & Pop Oil Shops. If you hate oil, fine, then we need to NOT DRIVE CARS or FLY PLANES. We might as well go back to living in the jungle or the desert, which is actually what many liberals and terrorists want us to do. That's just one of 15 dozen things they have in common.  If Bush says something "serious" and then makes an off-the-cuff remark afterward that means he's not taking anything seriously. More bullshit. I mean do liberals even read history? Do they know their presidents? Of course they don't, they are liberals. If everyone read their history there would be no liberals. We've had a great number of great Presidents who were plain-spoken and loved to make funny, seemingly careless remarks.(Uh, Reagan? Hello?) It's called genuine charm, not manufactured Bill Clinton sleazo charm.  According to Moore, most of our soldiers in Iraq are stupid, poor minorities who Bush has duped. They don't love their country you idiot American troop supporters! They are stupid and are serving because they have to. They like to abuse Iraqis for fun and sport (never mind the Iraqi they are shown "abusing" was probably headed to Abu Gharib, which is a prison compound for the rapists and murderers and theiving scum of Iraq.) This is probably one of the most insulting things anyone has ever insinuated about our service men and women. And it shows Moore's total lack of understanding about how the military works and what it's like to be a soldier. Oh sure he "talks" to a few supporters who aren't fans of Bush. But give me a break. Let's not pretend that 95% of soldiers aren't conservative because they are. There have always been bad soldiers, in every major war. Misguided losers who somehow slip through the cracks. Read Stephen Ambroses "Citizen Soldiers" to learn all about the different types of people who fought in our greatest war, and it wouldn't suprise me to find out that most of your lousy, deserting soldiers are liberals...  The movie is disgusting, it makes you sick. And not in a "this war is so wrong, let's oust Bush" kind of sick. As a Christian this movie made me feel spritually opressed. If I was one of those wacky Pentecostal types I'd say Michael Moore is possessed by Satan.  But I think even Satan dosen't manipulate and deceive quite as brashly and abrasively as Michael Moore.  P.S. For the record, I'm not one of these types who thinks Michael Moore should shut up. He has every right to say what he says and make the "movies" he wants to. And I have every right to call him a total and complete anti-American buttwipe.

      I just picked up the self-titled debut of  urlLink Ambulance LTD .  They're a mellow, retro-rock band out of New York.  The first song of the LP, "Yoga Means Union" is a slick 5 minute long instrumental, that builds and breaks and crashes like an emo song. But it's not emo, it's good.  The second song "Primitive (The Way I Treat You)" is their first single, and by far the most "radio friendly" song on the album. Pretty simple 4 chord progression, but it's well produced and grooves nicely.  The remaining 9 songs (including a "hidden" track) are mostly slow, mellow ballads (acoustic and electric) but they fill out the album nicely.  So check  urlLink them out .
