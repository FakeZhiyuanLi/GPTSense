      I start school in a week so staying up this late really can't be that great for me. I did finish enrolling today and am happy to annouce that I am taking a craft class. Screw phys. ed. Enrolling is such a fascinating thing for me. When I went to junior college we had to fill out carbon copy forms, and submit them to our advisor, who turned them in to someone else. Eventually, we would find out if we got into classes. Enter 2004 and the computer enrollment system. I can add all of my classes in about thirty seconds and know immediately if there are any problems. Not that junior college wasn't great for some things... I just can't really remember a lot from then. I wan't exactly focused, and wasted a lot of time, and money, and resources. Now, I'm left to think about that when I begin getting ready for a new semester. There are so many classes I could have taken for free and gotten out of the way years ago. Here I am paying out the nose for them. Such a waste. My half-decade-waste-of-life should be saved for another day and another post, though. Speaking of waste... I spent the greater part of the day arguing w/ a two-year old about waste. She's a bit fickle and likes to start eating something, change her mind, and get something else out. This drives me crazy. We end up throwing away tons of food. I told her I was going to buy a lock for the refridgerator so she couldn't get into it. She thought that was hilarious. I suppose if waste is genetic... I'm in trouble

      What ever happened to being a gentleman? I honestly can't remember the last time someone held a door for me, or at least let me walk in first. Today is just another great example of the degradation of the manner of the man. I haven't been home for several weeks and from the looks of things around here, the garbage hasn't moved the entire time I was gone. I live in a duplex shared by two gentlemen (term used  very  loosely). We all have to share one garbage cart that, on Tuesday, has to be moved to the curb. When I arrived home a few days ago our trash was all over the yard. No one had bothered to take the trash to the curb to be disposed of, and instead of pushing the trash down, they'd been piling it on top. So this evening I was outside cleaning. Our neighbor (whose cigarette and beer containers I was picking up), sat on the porch playing his guitar and watching me. As I struggle to contain his beer bottles and other loosely packed trash to move the container to the street, he rose to his feet... and went inside. I'm left to fight the garbage alone, which incidentally took me about ten minutes to get it to the curb while trying to keep my two-year old away from the street. Do any decent guys still exist? I'm quite certain none are jumping to take out my trash.

      Do you ever think, "Gosh, I wish I were one of those geniuses who post all of my thoughts on the internet to total strangers and friends alike." Well, here is your opportunity. I decided tonight to start a blogspot so that you can air your thoughts and opinions on every topic using only myself as a mediator (and we all know what a pathetic mediator I am). I want to hear stories, debates and just about anything else you would like to talk about. Not even religion and politics are barred. So go crazy! (And you know how intellectual we will all look carrying on elaborate conversations via the internet.) Correct grammar and punctuation are not a must... but don't be surprised if someone fixes it.. we're a bit anal around here.
