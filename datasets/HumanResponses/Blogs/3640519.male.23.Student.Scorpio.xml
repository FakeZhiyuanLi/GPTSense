      I have lived for twenty years in a small town called Mussoorie. I was brought there when I was less than three years old. That was when my father got transferred to the college in Mussoorie.  Most people view Mussoorie as some sort of a tourist attraction --- a typical British Raj hill station with a Mall Road and all the paraphernalia that goes along with one, a few waterfalls where you can satisfy your inner child's ( dear females, no pun intended !) desire to splash in puddles, a couple of spots where young honeymooners can spend some quality time, some roadside eateries which consistently fail to satisfy your demanding palate and lot's of poor rickshawwallahs and coolies who are always looking to fleece unwary tourists.  Mussoorie is not only all this but much, much more. For twenty years in Mussoorie have made me what I am today and I am afraid to trade these years with anything else lest it tur things for the worse. This small town where it is possible for one person to know everyone else, where people are still intereseted in what the family four blocks (I  use the term figuratively here) away is doing, where in one evenings walk you can traverse the towns entire span has , I dare say, more to it than one finds in big cities like Delhi and its likes.  There are so many intangibles, a term people like to use much these days, which still keep me a Mussoorie-man at heart. Pahaadi, my friends call me. I don't blame them. The hills are in my blood now. I  will always be attracted to the hills. The unforgettable scene of the Doon valley at night ---a dark sea on which are scattered tiny resplendent glowing  forms ; the winter line where the sky meets the earth ; the picture of clouds filling up the Doon valley and overflowing into Mussoorie; the temperamental weather where it alternates between bright and sunny to dark and rainy every few minutes; such images and many more will keep me connected to the hills and its people for life.

      These two words are like those tasty dollops of cream without which your breakfast would be as bland as boiled water. And why wouldn't it be so... Manmohan Singh, an economist to the core is at the top of the Food Chain of Indian politics. That too after a rather dramatic turn of events which shows that we Indians can never fail to amaze the world.  Take a look at the news channels. These two words rattle endlessly out of those talking heads 24 x 7. As if our lives depended on these. I wish it did so that we could expect some welcome changes in the quality of life here in India. And sometimes I breathe a sigh of relief that our lives are rather insulated from the antics of Indian politics. We are just like people at a variety show or an amusement park--- being taken for a ride and going back home pleased but with considerably lighter pockets. Is this mass unconsciousness that keeps India going --- people happy and politicians happy too ? Maybe...

      Robert Frost rests peacefully in his grave after giving us so much to think about. And often when overcome with the troubles and burden of modern life we pause to ponder, almost stopping by the woods on a snowy evening. Those memorable lines give us comfort not forgetting to remind us that soon we must get on with life. I often remember them when I am alone. Maybe, the lines have been crafted only for such moments. The Road Not Taken is a recurring story in all our lives. Some of these stories grow large enough to influence our entire lives. Lots to ponder about....

      We have had a glorious past, haven't we? That's what we have been brainwashed since childhood to believe. We never question the fact. And we have used  the statement freely in essays, debates, speeches, history exams and a lot of other situations since the day we were born. Patriotism is a matter of accident. Wasn't it mere chance that you were born in India and not in New Zealand or Pakistan? And what if you were born in those countries? You would say that your country had had a glorious past. But that is when we let sentiments cloud our rational mind.  If you stop to ponder and really look at our history with a critical view what do you see? Two hundred years of subjugation and oppression by the Brits. And even longer period under the Mughals and other muslim invaders. And before that India wasn't India so to speak. Hundreds of principalities fighting among themselves like cats.  And what developments took place in these one and a half thousand years. Nothing very relevant on the scientific front. Unusable knowledge hidden in tomes which today makes us take pride in saying that we had done it first. But what use is something which does not benefit society at all. Big thing we discovered ZERO. What good did it do to us(Indians , I mean) ?? There is an even bigger list of our so called achievements which have benefited others but not us. Why??Even today we have to look west for new technology. Isn't that shameful? Even modern political systems have had there beginnings elsewhere and not in India. Democracy  had to be imported. And even today some people are yet to come to terms with it. How else do you explain the mammoth following of ranis and rajahs of bygone eras, which lifts them upto pedestals of power in our country even today? Industrial revolution didn't begin in India. This was because of the lack of crucial discoveries which in turn was due to lack of any serioius effort in this direction. What we have been fed since childhood has pulled a curtain over our eyes.This false shroud makes us complacent. We should really attempt to get at a true picture of our country and look at its problems with a clearer perspective. I don't mean to say that we nothing to be proud of. It's the incorrigible blindness of some of my countrymen that I dislike.

      People say that once you get into IIT you are assured of a good job. But is a good job good enough. There is one thing that IITians dread and that is joblessness. Joblessness is a state where you find yourself stranded with nothing to do. This state is pretty similar to one of those uncomfortable nights where you deperately want to sleep but just can't. You toss, turn , groan, heave  to no avail. The most discomforting aspect is that your conscience pricks you that your time is draining away. You can spend your time at IIT  wastefully, and still end up with a decent job. But  joblessness is a state of mind where you are in perpetual discomfort. you procrastinate. You skive. You know you'll end up in muck. But when joblessness strikes nothing can save you. Your thoughts wander off and it's takes a great deal of effort to herd them back into the narrow confines of academic pursuit.  And today I feel one such bout has overcome me. I have typed enough.  Our placements start in July. May God give me a good job and keep joblessness away.

      That was not some typo that occurred up there. I really meant   ideal   .  IITians are supposed tohave ideal minds. But is this really true ? And what about the time when these ideal minds are idle ? Do they end up as Satan's workshop or, more appropriately, his ( due apologies to the fairer sex ) playground ?  I don't know why these questions of all days turn up in my mind today. I feel tempted to fall for the Faustian bargain. " Mephisto shoo..... . Go away. There are children at play. " That little ditty worked like a talisman. I am free now.       So are IITians owners of ideal minds ? Well this questions poses one more problem ....  what is an ideal mind. Is it a mind with special faculties for comprehension, analysis and creativity? Or is it a mind that can appreciate the human situation, accomodate differences and participate proactively in society and contribute to it in a meaningfulway? Or is it a mind which knows how to excel in whatever it takes interest in and is adaptable enough to preserve itself and moreover grow in a hostile world? Okay I am sorry for all the fart above. I have been talking like a philosopher posing more questions than I answer. But then  isn't that life ??? Everybody has to find an answer to suit himself. There are no answers applicable to everyone. As Morpheus said... "No one can tell you what the Matrix is. You've gotta see it for yourself."

      Yesterday I went out with four of my friends to see  Lakshya . Jamit, Paining, Prankul, VB and I. It was an ok sort of movie. Not the pseud flick we expected from Farhan Akhtar. But, nevertheless, it was better than the usual stuff which comes from the Bollywood stable. A little senti, with some often heard, loud-mouthed patriotic dialogues. Anyway I thank god it wasn't a one man show. PZ looked eminently delicious as always. Well today I seem to have been overwhelmed by an unusually potent bout of drowsiness. Hard work keeping my fingers at work hovering over the keyboard. Its hot in the lab,  the AC is not on. I think I will give my grey cells a rest and flick the AC on.

      Sunday morning. Feels nice. A nice morning walk to the FPGA lab. There is something I was waiting for... a mail by my prospective project guide. M.Tech project is a big thing ---- solid 20 credits which have the capacity to really shake your GPA ( for the uninitiated, small number x : x lies between 0 and 10 ). Things hadn't been looking good for the past few days and I was facing an endless sea of ennui. Besides, there was this tension of not knowing whether you had a project guide after all. This Sunday brought some peace of mind. Although in IIT we do not treat Sundays with that much reverence.... because Monday looms like a storm on the horizon and the day goes by in frantic attempts to escape inquisition at the hands of incorrigibly sadistic ESB profs. What about Saturday Night? Nothing like that Whigfield number. Wathched AIR FORCE ONE after a long time. Difference : This time in The OAT. The prez. smashing the crooks out of his plane and all the rest of the now so common Mega Sale of American Patriotism . What else... nothing much... IIT is pretty boring, if you get what I mean.

            I made a resolve on Friday night --- not to miss breakfast next morning. Well, it so happens that breakfast is served in the MEGA MESS (pun intended) from seven to eight-thirty , exactly that time of the day when the lure of the bed (the right kind) is at its peak. And therefore you need a resolve to coerce your conscience (I believe it is still alive) to make you drag yourself out of the sleepy bed.       At night, from nine to eleven I was reading a book on Economics by a Harvard prof. Believe me when I say that, unbelievably, the book is light reading. All those fundaes about the invisible hand guiding buyers and sellers in the market, why the goddammed Commies turned pauper, why you shoud trade with the U.S., why Tiger Woods should not mow his lawn, why it was right for Kobe Bryant to stay semi-literate... all those fundaes seem really cool at that time of the night. Gradually but surely you feel an invisible hand dragging you into Dreamland (no connection with M.J.).       All this while a great variety on creatures, which would put Animal Planet to shame, try their  level best to break in. Lizards looking for some non-veg in the vegetarian heartland of India, all sorts of oddly shaped moths,flies,roaches waiting for their final fling before putting an end to their irritating existence. After youhave put up with this and Economics for an hour and a half you decide to put an end to their futile struggle.TCLICK, the tube's off.and in the darkness you grope to find a place for your specks and then it is off to fantasy land ---- with, not to forget the resolve you have made to wake up for breakfast.(Although, Kacker, no pizzas with Oregano(whatever it is) await me).       It's not the sun but the brightness outside that pulls your eyelids open. You try to bury your head into the pillow but then your conscience kicks in, pricking you and prickng you till you decide enough is enough and boldly step out of your warm, no hot, bed and look at the timepiece. It strangely shows eleven o'clock and you curse yourself and try to kick yourself in the butt. The you start noticing things, the seconds arm is not moving at all . Hah, you pick up your wrist watch and lo, it is seven fifty. Enough time to stay true to your resolve. And you have done what you had failed to do for weeks now... Waking up early enough for breakfast on a Saturday morning.

      *********************************************************** ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE DAY GONE BY Read this arbit novel by Margaret Atwood. Crappy time-pass. And watched Shrek 2 again. Height of joblessness. Plan to read Economic Theory. *********************************************************** Today is a much better day. The sun has shown some mercy by going to  rest for a while behind the clouds. Yet I feel bad about leaving Dehradun at the cool foothills of the Himalayas and now sweating it out in MADras. I want to get on with some real work now but can't seem to get any. It seems it'll be so at least till July 1. Till that time I have to kill time.

      This is my first June in IIT Madras. Although I am in the final year of my stay this is the first time I am in Chennai in June. You can have a vague idea of the amount of joblessness here which has compelled me to take up this pastime. June is that time of the year here when sun and water combine to produce a heady concoction in the atmosphere which makes you squirm with discomfort and insects dance with glee. Imagine what that trickle of sweat slipping down your back would be thinking. What would be its last thought as it is soaked up by your shirt (or if its incredibly lucky by your (under/)pants)???? Will it have achieved its Nirvana or does it get doomed to a perpetual cycle of annihilation and rebirth??? The answers to such profound questions are not easy to come by. Our oversimplified world view does not have the capacity or even potential to comprehend such phenomena. That girl you have always liked and wanted to take ome to mom walks past you. And you wipe seat off your forehead and curse the damned Chennai June which has you looking like a sponge just freshly plucked out of an overflowing kitchen sink.That girl is  now a pink dot in the distance, like the morning star on the horizon talking to the most dreaded prof in the institute. And even the professor seems to be sweating. His day has begun with a bang and he won't have time to consider what sweat drops think. Now there seems to be a little naughty sweat drop on that girls neck. I saw it twinkle there in the morning sun. And now it has begun its expedition of exploration down the path every guy here wants to walk. Doesn't it all come round a full circle. The commonality between my thoughts and thoughts of that sweat drop--- so this long discussion had some meaning to it after all.

      And, lo, there were blogs all over. Some long ones , some short covering the long and short of it all. People read , at least some do here in India. Some write and some type. And so there are blogs all over for people to read. TRASH.... Random midnight typing cannot produce Paradise Lost, War and Peace maybe...
