      I'm bored...I really like this song...so...decided to post the lyrics for fun...lol   Artist: Tata Young Title: Cinderella  When I was just a little girl My momma used to tuck me into bed and she read me a story It always was about a Princess in distress And how a guy would save her and end up with the glory  I'd lie in bed and think about the person that I wanted to be Then one day I realized the fairy tale life wasn't for me  (chorus) I don't wanna be like Cinderella Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting For a handsome prince to come and save me On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side Don't want to depend on no-one else I'd rather rescue myself  Someday I'm gonna find someone who wants my soul, heart and mind Who's not afraid to show that he loves me Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am Don't need nobody taking care of me  I will be there for him just as strong as he, will be there for me When I give myself then it has got to be, an equal thing  (chorus)  I can slay, my own dragon I can dream, my own dreams My knight in shining armour is me So I'm gonna set me free   (chorus)

      Hey, my first blog! Never thought I'd start a blog...see, it's all because of you Wanniehead...you keep bugging me like mad until I can't stand it anymore...grr...well, if I don't like it I can just abaikan it lolz :P Anyway it's Friday and it's holiday time!!! Yay!!! :D But (sigh) I still hafta study cuz exams are very near...this near...the Japanese girls from Fukuoka(that right?) have gone back...when it was recess there was like a huge crowd cuz the 5 girls were clad in kimonos and our girls were like mad, taking pictures like there was no tomorrow lolz :) nice view from my recess spot actually...it was like a celebrity had come to our school! Why trouble yourself when you could just order a pic of all 5 of them in kimonos for a buck from the P & J Club? Of course, your face wouldn't be there...Yaso my dear friend was busy wrapping gifts for Sakiko, mind you, there're loads of gifts...postcards, a bracelet, a card, a shirt, and pics! She even wore her um...special contact lens just to take a pic with them :D Anyways gtg watch the Olympics...love the Equestrian sports!
