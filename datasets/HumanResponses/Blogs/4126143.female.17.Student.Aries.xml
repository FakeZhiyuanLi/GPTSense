      Forget his name, Forget his face, Forget his smile, his warm embrace. Forget him when they play his song, Forget you cried the whole night long. Forget how close you two once were, Remember, he has chosen her. Forget you memorized his walk, Forget the way he used to talk. Forget the things he used to say, Remember he has gone away. Forget his laugh, Forget his grin, Forget the dimples on his chin. Forget the way he held you tight, Remember he's with her tonight. Forget the times that went so fast, Forget the love that now has passed. Forget he said he'd never leave you, Remember - she will NEVER be you.  *-In every girl's life there's a guy she'll never forget and a summer where it all started-*  Never make someone your priority while allowing yourself to be their option.  "Sometimes I wish I had never met you because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing that there was someone like you out there."-Good Will Hunting  As we grow up, we learn that the one person who isn't supposed to let you down, probably will, and the one person that you never thought would be there for you, is. You're going to have fights with your friends, you're going to lose some of your friends, you may even fall in love with one of your friends. You will eventually lose someone you love - and love someone you never thought you'd find. People are going to hate you, love you, love to hate you, and hate to love you, but the ones you mean the most to will always be there. Life is too short. So have way too much fun - make way too many mistakes - take way too many pictures - have way too many friends and enemies - laugh way too much for way too long - cry over the smallest of things. But most importantly... Love with all you have.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it may be necessary from time to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye. *Miss Piggy*  *I'm not an idiot. I know how the world works. I've got ten bucks in my pocket, I have nothing to offer you and I know that. But I'm too involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowing you'll be alright-Titanic

            Another shitty day..but what can u do! I've been thinkin a lot lately..I dunno if thats a good thing or not! Just crushed that Brians moving soon..which brings up the breakup. Its really hard cuz i've never met anyone like him before..he's different..i'm scared someone else out there is going to find out how amazing he is..and i'll be out of luck..but there's nothing i can do about it..you can't make someone want you the way you want them..:(..hm..anywayz! new subject! I went w/ Ash to her Dr. appointment and then to her ultrasound!!! ITS A BOY! :) It was awesome to see the baby!!! It was moving around the whole time!! It took like 45 minutes..She gotta like 10 different pics to take home..They're soo cute! We've heard the heartbeat twice now! And then this morning i went to Winthrop with Em,Ciera, and Ciera's baby (Adrianna) to look at Em's senior pics..so i have a lotta anxiety about that too! woo-hoo. more shit to think about! I don't have anything planned for that...haven't picked the place, clothes, backgrounds or anything yet..really prepared,huh? oh well..yeah, tomorrow I'm getting my hair done so maybe that'll make me feel a lil better..who knows..Goin 2 the salon usually helps..I'm getting black chunks in my hair...my hair is already dark..so its not that drastic..maybe if i like it i'll go all black?! Its not like it really matters tho..

            Last Friday night i went to "The Notebook" and i really liked it! It was inspiration because it showed that true love does exist! But thats a movie...and we live in reality..rarely do u see that kind of love/compassion for each other these days. I see love in its truest form in older married couples. They've stayed by each others side for so long they can't imagine life w/o the other..Couples that have been married 40+ years..Who else can love u more than ur best friend..thats what it basically comes down to! I remember when my Grandpa was alive (passed away January 23,2004) he would always carry my Grandmas purse when they were out. Even tho it was huge and full of stuff she didnt really need..but wanted with..he was holding it for her cuz she couldn't..When i would see this i'd always think to myself.."thats what i want when I'm older, someone to care for me the way i saw them care for each other." It prolly doesn't mean as much to u as it does to me..But that reminded seeing this movie made me think of them..If u see the movie u'll understand what i mean about how older couples cherish each other...

       It's me again:) I wrote a blog before this one but for some reason i lost all of it when i was trying to post it! oh well..Today, fortunately, i don't have to work..so i'm kinda just spending the day trying to sort out my feelings! One thing i decided is that i'm going to be at truce with my body..no more punishing my body..no more self-hate..I'm done with that chapter in my life..count ur blessings, not ur blemishes! I am proud to say i gave up my Eating Disorder last weekend! I didn't love myself..so i couldn't believe how others could love me..i didn't understand! It was amazing for me to believe Jesus gave his life for ME! I am His!

      Here i am again..starting off another day, I'm really excited about YFC (Youth For Christ) tonight! A few of my wonderful friends from TEC are planning on going so i'm looking forward to see 'em! :) aw, I'm in a really good mood right now b'cuz i just got done talking w/ Brian on the phone! It's funny how talkin 2 someone can cheer up ur day. I'm just amazed by him. I went 2 the library yesterday w/ Emily 'n got some books..I'm reading 'Angels Watching Over Me' by Lurlene McDaniel. I haven't really started it yet, but the title reminds me so much of my friends! ~Good friends are like stars, you don't always see them but you know they're always there~"Friends are angels that come from above. Sent down from  God  for you to love. So if you are sad, and don't know what to do. Just remember that I care for  you !" They are the reason I'm here today! (along with God's help) THANK U ALL 4 UR SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE YEARS! love u!!!! take care!             rAcHeL

       For those of you that have never been to a TEC before you're probably wondering what my '4th day' means...I experienced a TEC this last weekend which is 3 days long..and every day after the retreat is your '4th day'. Today I am just mixed with so many emotions! I feel refreshed from a wonderful weekend! Anxious to help other ppl and to start a new beginning, Sad and hurt cuz brians leaving soon, Happy that  i met so many awesome ppl this weekend:), Grateful that i found God's love, Excited that Emilys going to a TEC:),and so much more!! I have feelings that i don't even know how to describe! Life means so much more to me now! Sooo many people influenced my life lately that I don't even know how to thank them...They are truly  angels of God . Yet, with all of this hope and ambitions for the future, and wanting to make a difference...I'm still hurting in the inside..I know i have to let go of someone special soon..and its not easy..he has done so much for me, and i have to watch him walk away..the worst part is i know he doesn't feel 4 me the way i feel 4 him,i haven't touched him the way he's touched my life, and he doesnt need me like i need him. But i guess thats the way life goes...
