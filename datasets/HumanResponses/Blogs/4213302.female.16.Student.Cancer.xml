      There once was a desparate guy called JP who lived in a place called Table View. One of my friends called Roxanne got JP's number(how?... i dont know). Anyways she gets his number and they talk for sumtime. He tells her he is in love with her after one conversation, so Roxanne called me to tell about wat happened. She was freaked and gave me his number to try to tlk him into leaving her alone... so i tried to talk to him, but after we spoke he fell in love with me! So i decided wat the hell let me tell diana about this guy.... So i give di JP's number and they spoke on the phone... and it happened again... he fell in love with Di(this happened ova a period of 4 days).  Me, di and roxy were 15 at the time... he told us he was 19. Anyways JP kept in contact with us for like a month. He would tell us stories about his sex life and his fantasies about us (believe me its too graphic to describe!!!) Roxy started feeling really uncomfortable and so decided to get rid of him... so she told JP that she was a lesbian (not true!). But then he simply said that whenever she felt like it, she should come with her gf and they cud all get freaky together!  Then he foned me and asked me if it was true about Roxy being gay... so i said "nope she jst doesnt wana speak to u, we all think u are a freak" So he told me that he really liked me and wanted to know if i would get freaky with him, so i got pissed and i told him i had a boyfriend and then i hung up the fone.  Then he decided to fone di... He told di that he loved her. So di said, "FUCK OFF! we do not want u go get urself a desparate gf like urself." He then said, " i'll get u guys i swear!" Kinda like a horror movie (everything here did happen).  So Jp stopped calling us for like 2 weeks. Then one day my landline rang, i picked up the fone and guess who was at the end... JP!. He started asking about when we would meet and stuff like that and in that conversation he accidentally let it slip that he wasnt actually 19 bt was 29. So i screamed and told him to never fone me again... he let out a horny moan and the line went dead. Then it hit me, I realised that i had never given JP my landline number.  After a while Roxy foned and told me JP had called on her house fone aswell. So we waited for di to fone and tell us that Jp foned her, bt suprisinly he hadnt. He did not fone us for like 3 weeks, bt he kept on calling di and leaving wierd messages on her fone. He had finally gotten ova us bt not ova di. So diana decided to get a new fone that way he wudnt have her number. Oh well, strange things do happen and he jst stopped calling. Anyways at the end of march he sent us a message saying he got a gf! Its not like we care, bt we feel srry for whoeva is going out with him, shes probably jst blind and as desparate.  This is a true story! PEACE!
