      Mr. Neldardo will soon be making an appearance at the Greenwich County Courthouse, sometime in late September. There will be NO pictures taken or autographs signed, nor will Mr. Neldardo give any interviews. He WILL, however, be giving out advance copies of his new album, entitled I will rewrite the history of the universe, as well as several pairs of his own personalized Velcro Shoes, The Neldardo 9000s.    Expect more details in the coming weeks.                              - Cat Stevens AKA Neldardo-Fan

      What is new with FRANCIS NELDARDO, you ask? I will answer pitiful ones of less fortune, for I am FRANCIS NELDARDO, which puts me at liberty to discuss myself, FRANCIS NELDARDO.  My desert tour went, how do you say, REALLY GREAT! I brought the boogie to the Mohave, and it was like rain on a desert, a desert of UN-DANCE WHICH I SPRINKLED WITH DANCE!!!!!! Unfortunetely, white racist hicks that go to KKK meetings and beat queers have brought charges against me for what they call "burning down a house." I call it "spreading the grace and wisdom of Electroclash, through the use of pyrotechnics." I was un Conneticut, the worst city in, how do you say, THE WORLD! for ice cream. I was flying back to Germany is a helicopter of dance, when I felt the need for Pistachio, and order the spinny bird of flight to LAND! I gave an impromptu concert with my triangle, which is carry around with me at all times, and commisioned my seasoned team of dwarves to create awesomeness in the form of SPECIAL EFFECTS, YAH! The city of Greenwich calls it a fire hazard, I call it NAZISM!  Yah.

      I will gamble with your souls, yah, because I am Electroclash God Francis Neldardo, and all will tremble with my dance.  Be lucky peons, because while vacationing in Las Vegas I will post in this blog, yah. After I leave Las Vegas I shall travel my native Deserts of Nevada and spread the dance to my Navajo brothers. Thats right, desert tour. Get your velcros yah, because all shall tremble with my dance and shake the sand from their shoes. Then I am off to the motherland, Germany, where I am teen idol, Electroclash God Francis Neldardo. Expect the chronicles of my life soon from my good follower Neldardo-Fan on this blog, it will be a jolly jingle story of trembling dance and wonder. Yah.  Be on the look out in the Mohave Desert because I will show up in random places and entertain my brethen, and give away free official Electroclash God Francis Neldardo velcro shoes. Off to the casinos for much gambling.   Yah
