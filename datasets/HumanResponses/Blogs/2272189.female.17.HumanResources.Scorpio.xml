       Hey people, everybody asked me if I blogged. Um, well, I didn't at first because I didn't feel like it, and I didn't know what to blog, so I'm going to just say some crap about me.  First, I think everybody has a commercial that they like, well my commercial is that one commercial where it is some cookie commercial, and the cookies was on the bus, and they said I'm squeezed in the middle smack dab in the middle squeezed in the middle smack dab in the middle. Everytime I see that commercial I laugh at it. Plus that commercial is so stick in your headable, because after the commercial is over you will find yourself singing that. Today out of no where I just started singing, I'm squeezed in the middle smack dab in the middle.   Last week.  Last week I meant to tell you guys, that I have this teacher and her breath smelled bad, I mean not awww the coffee bad, but I mean awwwww the munching on booty meat bad. Her breath smelled like she got done chewing on some skat, it was gross. See, I needed her to help me do my work, so I raised my hand, and she came over to where I was, and man, it was like even her whisper smelled she was like, what can I do for you, then I was like wwoooo um then I put my hand over my nose in a position to where she couldn't notice. So when she asked me what can she do for me I really felt like telling her to embalm her mouth. Man I felt like saying here is my toothpaste and a toothbrush it ain't like I'm going to use it plus I save it for a rainy day, and it might not be raining outside, but it is a storm in your mouth. I didn't tell her that, I just felt like it. Well, when she was telling me how to do my work, I held my breath the whole time, even when I was holding my breath it still felt like I could still smell that. It was ssssso gross. Plus, she tries to talk about everybody, and she came to school in some colorful looking clothes on. Now if you come looking like 4 Christmas trees don't try to talk about nobody, PPLEEASSE teachers don't do it. If you don't do it for you, please, do it for the students. I know you go to school to teach, but how can you teach if your clothes is taking all the attention(and light.) Stop right now teachers. If you had of  seen it you wouldstill be cracking up. I asked her where she get her skirt from, she was like girrrl I got this from France, it was specially made for me.I was thinkng( ha no wonder it was specially made for you.) I felt like telling her that she needs to take France to court for making that ugly thang. Ugh, you should have seen it. I mean she look like a box of crayons and skittles. Mixed together, it was like her skirt was really tasting the rainbow. Look like she had her kids to color it. France hahaha cracks me up. What she need to do with that dress it save it for a generator in her house, I mean the dress can light up her whole house. She don't have to buy solar power, she could just use her dress. Man. Well, let me stop because I can talk and talk and talk about her dress. OOOOO plus she is around 40 and she looks like she had a face lift. Not just a face lift, but a couple of face lifts. It is like if she get anymore face lifts her chin is going to be where her forehead is, boy let me stop for real now, See, I'm to bad, but hey, she need to quit. I would end this with shot outs but I just want to end this by saying.  I love you all, each and every one.

        GOD HAS SMILED ON ME, HE HAS SET ME FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       God has surely smiled on me, he has surely set me free, and overall been good to me. I'm going to start this by truly saying you know. So I'm going to go beyond what I always say about guess what and you know what and right and the over all favorite, you know. So I'm starting this with a you know. So, you know, I got to thinking, about life, and what I have been doing and about the people who tries to help me go through life, and what God has done for me in my life. Me MARTINA, took life for granted a lot. I lied to folks, a lot of folks but not about the same thing, I deceived folks that was and still is dear to me, I lied to them also. I did some ungodly things, and that is what was tearing me up inside. See, the thing is, is I was holding all this anger all this pain, all this deceitfulness, all this cheating, all this lying, all boggled up around my heart, and God was looking at all of that (the devil too) and he was working with it, trying to say Martina you need to do what is right, right now, and you know what it is and all. So, lately I have been having dreams, and God has spoken to me through them, he was showing me that I need to get my life together and do what is right, he told me to serve him and not the world, and really, all I was doing lately was serving the world, instead of the man, who got betrayed, lied on, spit on,hit in the face,who got thorns around his head(I know what it is called but it isn't coming to me at the moment lol but hey bare with me)who had to carry his own heavy cross a long way,who was tired and still carried it, who got hung on the cross, just for me, and for my sins. See, I took that for granted because all this time I wanted to serve that God, and I found myself serving something that wasn't of him. God, he didn't have to die for me, I mean he could have stopped all of that, he could have been like heavenly father, stop me from suffering, stop all of this, and it could have been done, but no he didn't he suffered for me, and for all of the sins in the world. Right now I am finding myself in an emotion state because I'm just overwhelmed about what I'm writing here. But it is all good. All of this hurt anger and pain, was great captivation, that I was going to actually go through a mental breakdown. I just got to thinking about my mother, and what she did, and didn't do. I mean, I can't be mad at her, because all she did as give me life, and I thank her for that, and life, is all a person needs. I spent time saying how I wanted to take my life, rather than thank God for it. Right now, I'm laughing at my own stupidity. Because taking a life rather than thanking God for it is so non strategic. I think I said enough here even though I want to go on.   Firstly I want to give the bestes shot outs ever.   Eliza - I want to thank you for all of your wise words, those last words, stop focusing on all the wrong things and focus more on the good things. That really hit me. I just want to thank you for being a good older sister, you didn't let me fall, not once, and when you think I did, you lifted me right back up. Thank you big sister thank you. OOOOO before I forget,  on a good tip, hit me when you see me, I mean literally hit me, for all those curse words I said, and Sonia if you don't see her hit me you better remind her, or you better hit me yourself. Ok? ok.   Sonia - Girl you know I wouldn't leave you hanging like meat on a stick. (LOL there goes another one.) I want to thank you for all of your cares and thoughts and everything, I mean even though you don't give advice, you gave advice, even when you think your not giving advice and just asking questions, your giving advice on top of asking questions, and I just want to tell you thank you for just being there for me. Just for being a good and caring friend like you are. You too Sonia, on a good tip, if you see me you better hit the blue living mess out of me, I mean literally hit the blue living mess out of me. If you forget to hit the blue living mess out of me, Eliza you better remind her, and if you don't, you better hit the blue living mess out of me.  For both of you, with that said, you all better just beat me down, I mean down to the ground, for all those words paaaaaa I needa woopin. So, you all better remember too, because I want you all too hit me, and if you all don't :) you all is gon getta side kick up side you all heads (   :) cheese)  OH before I forget and as for this l^l you all better hit me double for that one, because nobody needs that. OK? ok bye you all.

        I feel kinda complete   HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYBODY  I was scared, I just sat down, and I was trying to remember what happened to me a long time ago, and by golly, I remember. See, a long time ago, I was living with this woman named Mrs. Sidney. Like when I was 4 years old. I don't remember that much but some stuff. When my aunt lied to me, I had to find out where I came from. So, I got online and looked up the name I was supposed to look up, and I found it. I felt like I wanted to call her, but when I actually thought about it more, I didn't want to call. Then today, I finally called her. We had a muaaaaaaaa nice conversation I guess. Not sure, but it was ok. I want to say what we talked about but not online. So Liz, if you read this before you call me I will tell you all about the conversation when you call me.  Subject Change   Hey everybody else, I need help, I am really slacking in school. I never study anymore, it is like I am tired of this junk, but next semester I will pick up the stuff, because it is like every first semester, I don't do nothing, but now I am. I sort of do the same shotouts so I'm going to end this by saying bye and I love everyone especially Eliza and Son my two bestes friends. PEACE OUT

        What I have been told wasn't ever told.   Hey, I have so much to say, I'm not happy today, because it is something I need to say. I'm going to start with MOM,DAD,MAYBE BROTHERS, MAYBE SISTERS. I don't know who you are. I don't know who I am. I thought I was someone until I found out I wasn't. Everyone has been lying to me. I don't care, but they should have told me. The people that I talked to you all know who you are. All these fake pictures of a loving family. It is so stupid. I had to find out for myself. That my roots are something else. It is all cool though. That just made me stronger, because I have to endure the life changes, that are brought before me.    I'm to to to bad  I'm bad because, I'm selling suckers for my Health Occupations class. It was some sophomores selling the same suckers at lunch, so there bag was empty, so I sat next to them and put my bag on the table, so people started to flock to me, and bought most of my candy, by the end of the day I had 4 suckers out of 30, I think that is pretty JESUS good. Don't you think. Then those people was looking at me like, if she doesn't get the hot mess out of her I am going to ring her neck. I stole their shine, now they are mad, HUH ask me if I care, I most certainly do not. Now, I am going to go so I am going to end this with shotouts.  AHMAD- Even though we don't go together, I still love you. I am always going to love you. You just don't call me anymore boyyyy. We are best friends,best friends keep in touch. Kariem do your blog MAMMIT.  SONIA- I love you.(don't worry no lesbian here, if that is what u was wondering.) Your such a good person, I think the letter idea is so cool. You talked to Brian, how cool. I wish you guys could work it out, but what ever happened it is for the best for both of you guys. I love you girl.  ELIZABETH- I love you to to to to to much girl, just to much. I don't know what I would do with out you. You help me up when I fall, when ever I feel down, your always around, you ask me what's up, even when I say nothing, you wont rest until I tell you, because you know it is better to let it out than to keep it in. I love you so much for that. I just don't know how to thank you, other than saying thank you. Truly, there isn't any love you like a sister, because you are my sister, and I love you like my sister, because that's what you are.   I have to go everyone, Have to talk to my cousin to see what's up with her, bye now   LOVE U ALL.

        GUESS WHAT YOUR ON FRIENDS GONE WILD!!!!!!!!!   I have some crazy and loving friends, I'm going to tell you about them plus me...  I know what your thinking and your thinking WOW how crazy can she get? I'm going to tell you.  Starting with Elizabeth.   Elizabeth- She is 18, and a Freshman in college. She tries so hard to make everyone happy even when she isn't happy, I respect her for that. Now, the funny part about her is uh I never really got to know the intense funny part about her. She is always so serious sometimes, I guess. But she is down to earth, I love you girl I'm going to crack on you. See, Elizabeth is a little to much down to earth, because if I stand by her and we bend over and touch the ground she will touch it before me. LOL, still love you though.  Sonia- She is 18 and also a freshman in college.She is so cool, and funny and she doesn't really care about stuff. She is the same way, pretty much down to earth, a little lower than me, but hey we can deal with that. Her funny point is, is she likes to make up word like me, even when it is funny because she tries but they don't seem to come out like mines. What is really funny is she goes with my brother but she hasn't talked to him in ages. I think, if I'm not mistaken. Over all, I love her muches.  Ahmad- N/A( ex- boyfriend)  Kariem- N/A( ex-boyfriends brother)  Rashad-N/A ( ex-boyfriends brother)  Leon-N/A ( talking right now, but I don't know because I haven't heard from him in a while, like a week to be exact.)  Brittany- Brittany is cool, even though she is so stuck on her self, she just needs a little Jesus in her live, then she will find out that all this wordily stuff aint worth the hard ache and pain. Over all she is pretty nice to hang with.  Kim- She is cool, just met her but from what I have met she is pretty cool. Her funny part, she is pretty sarcastic, which is good, because me too. Over all she is cool.  Now for the bestes yea what is bestes, well bestes is my word and bestes mean best just with a es, so it is bestes. Of Course meeeeeeee...  Martina- Man, this sexy dark chocolate girl just makes you want a taste at the sight of her, man she is hooked up from the what ever up. ( substitute what ever) Just look at her, her hair looks so good, and long (for a black girl, because some black girls are so bald headed) well off of bald headed girls, more on long haired me. I love me, I'm so captivated by me. Wish you could be me, but hey I'm me so you cant be me.    GOT BOOBIES   Hey I feel a little embarrassed, I was on the phone with my girl Sonia, yea the one that is funny. My mom came out of the bathroom and saw me without a brow on and she said,"Oh my lord, you don't have no brow on look at them sag"  Sonia, was so cracking up laughing, she said"hahaha she just told on you like that".  I said yea your right, but I didn't bring that back up.  But hey, MY BOOBIES ARE GROWING HOW COOL. I'M GOING TO BE SO BIG SOON. ( ugh who wants that)  UNTIL NEXT TIME THAT'S ALL FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        !Hola me blogetta amigas!   okay everyone, I have really been slacking on my blog, I just felt no need in doing it lately, because it wasn't nothing to talk about. Now I have something to talk about. Today man, I felt so good, I got up I prayed, I was like uh uh uh yea yea uh huh uh huh, because I was going to church, but no the devil had to get in it. I got ready for church, and then I waited an hour for the church van to come pick me up. I waited I waited and I waited, Then at 10 which is when Sunday school starts, I gave up on going. So I walked around with my head hanging down to the ground. I felt so low. But I prayed again, and I feel better now. I mean yea were there's a will there's away, but I had a will but it wasn't a way. No money for a cab, buses don't run on Sunday, and nobody to pick me up. Now what way did I have? To walk, no by time I got there I would have to walk right back, because church would have been out.   UGH IT IS SO MUGGY   I'm sitting by my window, not knowing weather it is snowing or raining, it looks to light to be rain and it looks to heavy to be snow, huh I can't win from losing can I? I want to go out there and get me some tamps, but no money, I don't feel like asking my mom(grandma but call her mom) Hey Sonia not stamps but the tamps, in this case you know what I'm talking about LOL. OMG I feel myself coming one, because my stomach is so cramping and stuff, but I got a good extra week left. I need to go buy some, I might just ask my karate instructor to drop me off at the store before karate, so I can buy some, then when I come out the store with them, and he ask me what they are, then I will tell him they are personals, then he will say what, then I will say look look at this just look then I will show him the box and he will probably say ooo. Which is going to be the end of that convo. LOL  My breast feel so superfluous   WOW my boobies are hurting more, and I keep feeling on them, to see if I got cancer but no I didn't feel lumps. So the only thing is, is that they are growing, I know the reason why they are growing too, for two reasons, number one  Nursing home, this man pinched it so hard, it felt like my nipple ripped off of it. OMG it  did hurt so bad. Number two reason, Um, I was over  ahems  house and we kinda started to  ahem  and then he  ahemed  them. Yea that explains it. I bet you guys are wondering who  ahem  is, so  ahem  is who he is. Liz, Son, other saints, I bet your wondering how I got in that situation, well it is pretty self-explanitory. Liz, Sonia, don't worry I didn't get very far, and don't worry, it was before I was fasting and praying and all that other good stuff.   TIME FOR A SUBJECT CHANGE   Okay, all my blog friends,  Praise Jesus , how are all you all doing> Yea like you can really answer that, but anyways, for the people who don't know me and wondering how I could say all this stuff, well I am open, what ever comes to my head I will say it, what ever I feel I will do it. So, if you don't want to read what I put, then don't if u do, join the ride, if your not sure, find out what step you want to take. As for now, I'm out Peace(oooo I forgot the shot outs hold on right quick don't leave just yet)  Liz- I love you, I have a question for you, if I was married and I had kids would you be my child or children God mother? I love you girl  Sonia- I love you too girl, I have a question for you, If I had a child or children would you be the God mother also,  For both of you, if you answered yes, I would appoint both of you the job, except I would probably pick you Sonia over you Eliza, because you Sonia, you always talk about having kids, and loving them, and you Eliza, you never talked about kids. You Sonia, I saw you handle kids, and your pretty nice with them, and you Eliza, to me it seemed like you didn't have time for them.   Hey but I still love both of you all.  Thalia- I love you, keep your head up, what ever the case, you need to keep your head up, don't ever give up. I think that will be a good blessing, plus it will teach you a lot of things. For instance, it will teach you to not be on the go all the time, because you seem to always be on the go. Second, it will teach you how to love, I know you Lia, you don't have time or love people in the way that they love you, and your not completely solid, I think it will teach you to be solid as in to care about something.  Don't kill it either that will be so wrong, hey look at it this way, what if your mom killed you? Think about that, and what if she didn't want you, think about that too. Until next time    THAT'S ALL FOLKS!!!!!!!!!

        Hello, I'm beeeeeezzzzaaack   I don't feel like talking that much, I am living in a world of hurt, I hurt one of my closest buddies. You know who you are, I need not tell. Just want to tell you that your right, no one deserves to be treated like that, not you not I, not nobody. I need to be prayed for, on top of that I need to do a lot of praying and more fasting.   Sonia, I don't like you going with my brother, Bri, he is not good for you, just recently I found out he wasn't acting saved. He was saying all this stupid stuff about meeting you, and what he wants to do. It sounds so stupid, and hearing it from him, is so crazy.  Elizabeth, I already told you what the deal was, I mean the really real deal. No fake junk, no lies just straight up the real deal. And, I just, never mind just forget it. Um, Yea I still like you and all of that, but the other way around probably isn't so fortunate. If you knew why didn't you say something earlier? I mean you could have been like yea, that's wrong because I know, instead of saying yea uh huh is that right all the time. But I'm not mad at you, you deserve to be mad at me. And if  this should break up our friendship, then let it be. But if I happens to not break it up then let it be. So, right now I will let you be. Peace out.  Sonia, You have no clue what I'm talking about, but you probably do and just wasn't saying anything that's cool. though. I mean, if Eliza tell you then ok, but if she doesn't then ok. I'm not going to say Eliza don't tell her, because I think you should no, even though it has nothing to do with you. But if she chooses to tell you then she just tell you, I'm mean it was very wrong once you think of it. I'm so upset for my wrongdoings so to end this I will say Peace out. LYLAS (LOVE YA LIKE A SISTA)  P.S Liz since I knew you knew, and I finally came out and said it, I have to pray and fast and let the lord give me my blessing, because that was stopping me from getting my blessing. LYLAS (LOVE YA LIKE A SISTA) BYE

        SONIA THIS IS DEDICATED TO YOU AND ONLY YOU.   Sonia I love you girl, I love you even the more now. It takes heart to say what you went through. I want you to know that I had similar problems also. I was and still is very sensitive. I am so sensitive. You are so beautiful I love your color I love your face giirl you have a hot body( no lesbian stuff). I wanted to tell Leon to move over so I can just sit and stare at you the hole time because your so pretty. I mean you look so way better than me. I am just a period at the end of a sentence. Sonia, I want you to know that I have been through something worse. I was in the 6 grade, I was walking home from school, and I was singing Praise the Lord everybody.Then these girls came to me and was like hey there's that dark ugly girl lets jump her. So they jumped me. The result of that was I had 2 broken legs. All I could do was cry and shout. Finally when I didn't show up home. My dad came and saw me. Then he got me and he took me to the hospital. I felt to sad, then when I went to school, I was in a wheelchair. Then those same girls mad fun of me. Sonia, I found myself crying for reasons that I didn't know of.  We all know that song. " Long as I got king Jesus, long as I got king Jesus long long long as I got don't need no body else. I've been lied on cheated talked about mistreated I been abused used," need I go on.I found myself being a conformist when I really wanted to be a nonconformist. As much as I tried to find my one transcendentalism inside of me some people always found ways to bring me down. I relate you more than I do Liz now, and I respect that. I love you just like one of my sisters now. Liz I love you too.  I love both of you guys the same.I love everybody. Sonia, Brian really loves you. Do you think he will ask you out or not? He is so scared to. I want you to know that I love to love to love you love you love you. I am going to go to let you talk to Brian so buh bye. I love you.   God Bless you   Good night.

        ROAR   See, this is Martina here, ok for the real see now. Um see, I always wanted to know what Sonia and Eliza mint about ROAR. Now that I went to her church or their church I finally found out what the means. So now I'm just finding myself saying ROAR. I am going to have to go, because I got to get up to go to my medical class tomorrow. I'm just going to end this by saying that, I was about to shout because I felt myself. My lip started to tremble, it was my mandible(lower lip or bottom lip) to be exact. I was so glad to have Leon their. No he isn't saved yet, and he is going to be pretty soon, he is changing, he already went through the whole process. For inquiring minds, ( Sonia and Elizabeth, and sorry to say but the bugaboo, Symone, still love ya girl but man. Sit ya but down, sit ya but down.) Leon isn't my man, or my brother, or my cuz, he is just a very very (very)close friend of mine. I'm going to leave with shot outs.  First shot out to Pastor Jarvis and first lady Mona.

        *SIGH*   Today was the worst day of my life. I know, that if I don't repent then I'm going to go to hell. I did something very bad that I know God doesn't approve of. Liz, you know what I'm talking about.   CHANGE   I don't know still what is going on in my life. I feel depressed, but the people who say Martina what's wrong I just mainly act like I'm fine. Even when I'm not deep down. I wish that I was somewhere where I can be needed. Liz, honestly, I wish I was at your church praising the Lord right now. I really don't like it when you tell me what went on at your church, because I get jealous, and I want to be a part of it. That's why I can't wait until I go back to church, or go to your church.    Eliza   I just want to thank you for taking some of your time out today, to talk to me, because truthfully, if you had of never called back, you wouldn't be able to talk to me anymore, because I would have did something stupid. I know that you do get tired of hearing my personal problems(Ahmad none to do with you boo.) but, I do appreciate you, talking to me like that. I am so glad that you care about me, because if I didn't have a person like you in my life right now I would kill myself. Seriously.   Sonia   I know you have no idea what I'm talking about, I don't talk to you much. But lately, I have been depressed, and I have been going through periods of anxiety. I was tempted to take my life, knowing that I would end up in hell. I'm so sorry for you and Brian, he is very much so in love with you girl, he wants you so so so so so so so so so so bad bad bad bad bad bad. You just ddddon't have a clue, or maybe you do. But I just want to say that I enjoy talking to you to. I just don't talk to you talk to you like that like that. You know what I mean.  I'm going to go now, just leaving this with shot outs.  Kariem, boy I love you. Your my bestes second brother in law. I have to say Kariem, you still need to stop farting. Have you seen that deodorant commercial? When that guy raised his arms, and he killed the little men on the fooseball table. Plus his friends. That how your farts smell. Your farts can literally kill folks. You need to work on that hun really work on that. Nasty Nasty all that farting. Kariem says quote on quote, " I walk with a limp, because my nuts a heavy".  " I like cheese". "I like chicken".  I love you Ahmad. We are still having something blocking our relationship, and you still know what it is. I know that in the future it won't work out, so you know the best thing for us to do. It is just up to you.  I'm leaving by saying I love you all, and bye.

        Today isn't any better than yesterday.   Right now, I'm sitting here crying, I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know how I'm feeling right now. I am very good at hiding my emotions. I just need a person to talk too. I need a helping hand. It is my pastor she is making me mad. Sunday was the 1st Sunday, so we was supposed to have service at 4 in the evening. The girl that is in the choir with me, wanted to go back to church so did I. So, we thought the van would run. It didn't. So I didn't go. My friend has heart. She walked to church, with a bunch of little kids. To make it so bad, my pastor didn't even take them home. She had to walk back home with those kids. It was so cold that night too. I felt for her.That isn't even right. I think I'm going to find another church. Yea, people might think that my pastor is cool, until you get to know her, maybe that's why don't hardly nobody go to our church now. She always run them out. Like it was a visitor, and she didn't have on any sleeves, it was like a tank top shirt. My pastor told her to put her jacket on because she didn't want to see the girls arms. I was thinking what kind of skat it that. Today, my  pastor called my grandma, and my pastor asked how her day was. My grandma said that she was tired because she washed all day. Now, everytime my pastor calls someone she always got to make herself seem better than them. My pastor say " on " or quote on quote, "See now, if that was me I wouldn't be that tired, I do more stuff then that everyday and I don't be tired". Plus, my pastor asked if my grandma was going to go to Bloomington Sunday. I was like we supposed to be going Saturday, what is going on, why she going to change it at the last minute. I don't know what is going on. But I'm going Saturday, even if I have to walk, and run I'm still going. I'm going Sunday, because nobody said nothing about Sunday. I don't know what has gotten into my pastor, but everytime she does that to somebody, and I want to go speak up for them, the people at our church tells me not too. So I don't, but next time she does that to me or my family, I'm going to share some words with her. I don't give a skat.   ELIZA  If you see me come to our church any Sunday or during the week, that means that I don't go to pastor S. Church, she is getting on my last nerve ending, I mean she is riding all the way up my spinal cord.   SONIA  Brian told me that he needs to talk to you, and he needs to talk to you bad. I do have a little info, he says that he is moving to California, but he can't sleep, eat or do anything without you being his girl. He says that he is going to ask you out and you better say yea. But then he says he is scared because of the same thing that Lamont went through, he says that anybody who was dear to Lamontario's heart is dear to his, and he knows that Eliza was hurting so, he doesn't want that to happen to you.   WOW   I feel much better since I went blogging, but not a whole lot. Ashley I'm sorry that you ended up like me, losing your baby, it's quite painful huh girl. I know, maybe you need to change your life now. Makes you think twice about life doesn't it. But, everything happens for a purpose. I love you Ashley, even though we get in a lot of fights your still my baby sister for 3 minutes.   I'M GOING NOW SO BYE. P.S. NO BODY E-MAILED ME YET, SO I GUESS YOU COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE ANSWER.  SONIA, OR ELIZABETH I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP ON THIS BLOGGING THING, I NEED YOU TO HELP ME TO SET UP SOME LINKS.   BYE.

                              Praise the LOOOeeeed      Evrbody    Hello. I'm so excited, I feel like I just accomplished everything I needed to do. It feels like I'm flying on a peppermint patty. I just wanna say that I love my Lord, and I have really been slacking on being one with him. I haven't been praying a lot. I haven't been fasting a lot. I haven't been doing nothing lately. So, I have to get back to the real Good stuff.            THANK YOU JESUS   Guess what, lol ok, maybe you can't guess what.   See I hate that, and I find myself asking those rhetorical questions too. See, I hate when people say hey Tina, guess what, I say um no, I can't guess what. Our they say hey Tina, you know what, I say um no I don't think I do. Or when your friends talk to you and they say for instance( see what I did today was go to school right) and if you talk to me then you know that sometimes I say wrong, because I don't know if it is right or not, after all your the one telling me.                 Since I'm on the subject*********    Don't get me wrong I love everybody. But, I just have to say, that I hate it when one of my white friends at school say she got a ghetto booty, she have a  flat butt, and she said man, look at my ghetto booty, I started laughing and I told her where, I don't see it. But see she is my girl so we crack on each other like that. Sometimes when I talk to my friends of color, I say yea man ona fin ona fin. Then my friend of......Not so color says what is ona fin. I say, ok let me break it down for you here, let me put it in  terms to where all my caucazoid friends will understand. See, ona fin means like ona real. Then she says ok, um one more question what is ona real, I said oh I'm sorry let me break it down in silly white girl terms, on a real is seriously. No I'm not prejudice, I love everybody.  Okay, back to the real guess what*****   I love my jacket that Lamont bought me, man it is so biker, but it real, and I like it and I found 18 bucks in it.( Eliza eat your heart out I find 14 dollars more than you lol). But ya still big sister. I think I am going to save it, because if I go to karate then I will get 10 bucks from my uncle and that will be 28 bucks to have. Then if I get my money my grandma give me then that will equal to be 48 bucks, and I'm going shopping Friday, for a skirt and shoes, and I can con my friend into giving me some money. Which it just depends on how the day is going for her to give me money. ( Big up to you girl Shannette).  I would give shot outs but I don't feel like it so. I am going to end this by saying Eliza Sonia big ups to yall, I can't wait to see you girl Son. Eliza I can wait til the end of the world. Just joking Just joking, your my big sister, I can do that CHEESE.   I FINALLY BOUGHT LOTION SO MY KNEES AINT ASHY NO MORE THANK U LOOOOEEEED.

         I'm here to finish this it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Hello, again everyone. I'm backkkk, to finish it. I just got back from church, I had fun. I learned that we should want to be born again in Zion,if you know what I'm talking about I don't need to say much more. Last night, I left off at Lamont and Brian, so from there it is me (Martina) and my sister Ashley, which I already told you about. After that it is my 14 year old brothers, John Jr., and his brother named Michael. John is in high school, he is in the same grade as me, he is a junior, but his twin is still in the 8th grade. Every little girl likes them, mostly John, because he has some pretty green eyes, and Michael just have brown ones. This girl called John, and I was on the other line ,which he didn't know, and this girl was like, his eyes are so stimulating she would lick his eyeball, and he said yea oh really you need to get the hello off of my phone, because you need help. I wouldn't let you lick my eye what's wrong with you. Then I was like uh uh I started laughing and hung up. LOL. After that it is my 10 year old brother Eric and his twin named Erica, yea go figure. They are in the 7th grade, my parents raised some gifted young ladies and gentlemen. Little girls be after Erics butt, and little boys be after Ericas butt. Then their are my little sisters that are 7 named Tomeka and Olivia. Tomeka, she is a smart mouth, she is in the 2nd grade. Tomeka needs to get her asssssspple whipped. Olivia, she is in the 6 grade, she is the complete opposite of Tomeka. She is the good girl. Then after that, their is my 2 year old brother, and sister, Nakkia and Greyson, they are twins, Nakkia is a smart little girl. All the little boy are going to be after her, when she gets older, I can see it now. Nakkia is a loving little girl, she barely cries, she is always smiling, if you say Nakkia give me some sugar she will kiss you. Greyson is the same way. He is so loving and caring and everything that Nakkia is. I wanted to do this last for a reason. Of Course, my parents. My dad named Kabbuttoo Kuteyi, or John Nash, is 41 he is my daddy. Yep he is the brain behind the soldier behind the pump. Ya probably saying, what is Martina talking about, but, think about it. Yea yea oh yea ugh I can't believe she talked about that. LOL well I did. He is an EMT or an emergency medical technician. He is the one that watches people when they die, or go into cardiac arrest, or witness a myocardio infraction.(heart attack). On the side he draws cartoons. Now, my mom she is 39, she is so loving, and down to earth. She  is real strict though. Sometimes I think my friends don't like her, because she was making the loving making sounds when she answered the phone and my boyfriend called and he asked me what is my mom doing. And stuff. I was like uhhhhh uhhhhhh uhhhhhh. Let's just leave it at that. She doesn't look 39, she is 5'4 and she weighs like 160 something because she is pregnant. But she usually weighs 127. Some of my brothers friends was trying to holla at my mom, and my mom went along with it then shot his game down, which was so funny. Ron, I'm sorry for telling boy, LOL but ya know better now huh?. I didn't go through all the family I have because there are much more.      OMG guys. Saturday, I went to get some stuff from the store, and this white boy with rotten teeth was trying to holla at me, me being saved I was supposed to let him down easy, but I didn't. Um, I was sitting on the bus, and he came down and sat by me and put his hand on my leg, so I knocked it off, then he grabbed my arm, I was thinking ok I'm let it stay there. Then he smiled at me and I looked at him, and it seemed like when he opened his mouth booty meat smells came out. Yea I know your saying ugh what is booty meat smell well just think about it. Back to the story. When he smiled he said Hi, so I waved my hand in the sign language hi, because I do sign language, and then he said how am I, so I shook my head no and pointed at my mouth. So he could understand, then when he said ok I'm sorry. I felt so bad, but at the time I was just cracking up. It was so funny. Then today I went down town and I saw him again, and he got out of the transfer house just to ask me for a light and I shook my head nope. I know God will get me for that, if I don't repent. I am going to do that later on.    I had a lot of encounters like that. Like this one guy, I mean his head was so nappy, it seemed like his strands of hair was trying to talk to me. It seemed like they was at war with each other. I am telling you Ossama Bein Laden could hide in all of that.  And it was this one guy, everytime I would try to talk to him he would twitch, that scared the BaJesus out of me. I could laugh and then he would laugh and then his eyes would get big and then his shoulders would go back and his neck would twitch forward. He was lucky I was saved because I probably would have told him to get the dark chocolate out of my face. He is my friend and that is it. NOW. People use to talk about me sick like. Just my color because I'm dark and everything. But I don't care, I'm Nigerian I supposed to be dark. This girl with no hair was like ugh Martina you so black. And I didn't say nothing to her, so she had the nerve to come to school with a wrap still in her head, so she was like ugh Martina, I was like come on now, you don't even have any hair, how you gonna try to come to school with a wrap if your hair stop half way around, then I pointed at her head and was like that ain't even a wrap, its a wra. I said where is the P, where is the rest of it. Her hair was so short man you could take a little black rubber band and it all of it still didn't fit in it.   OMG, then it was this other girl, she said the same thing ugh Martina why you so black, I told her I'm Nigerian I supposed to be black, she gone say, so. I said yea so. I'm sorry Lord, but I told her why is her neck so damn black.Then I was like do you got a problem with my color, then she said yes, so I said then go home and wash ya black asssssple neck. I'm serious no lie, in the summer she wouls sweat dirt. That's how black it was. Then I told her not to miss her zygomatics(cheeks) then she said awe ok you funny hahahah. Then she didn't say nothing to me. I think I said a lot. I'm going to end this by giving shot outs or is it shoot outs O well you know what I mean.  Sonia- I don't talk to you much but you cool. Sorry about the about. You will find out if its something to find out. O well that didn't make sense but ok.  Elizabeth- You my girl, I can't wait until I go to your church. I still don't want to get up there and sing with those kids. It is going to look so retarted, just wait and see. You will know.  Tura- I don't know you, but God bless you.   Any other friend of Liz- Hello. and good bye.  okay that was so retarted but I don't give a female monkeys right fallopian tube. Yea, that was slow too. well im going to be out like white on rice and a paperplate in a snow storm. bye everyone

They need to work some stuff out. Christian if you read this,(shhh which I doubt you wont), words of advice, strap it up before you smack it up, turn it, flip it twist around, bring it back, drop it pick it up, and etc. Then there is Ashlei, she isn't married, sorry to tell your business, but mean dont like her, because she is such a pain in the gluteus minimus and the maximus.

His name is Justin.Then there is Lamont(R.I.P) and Brian, they are 19. Lamont died a couple of weeks ago. He was a psychologist. He was saved he was heaven of cute, he was everything Elizabeth could ask for. Then there is Crazy apple brian, she is in his last year of college, he is studying to be the same thing Lamont was. Brian works for a phone company. He can make manager in a couple of more years. He is so bright, he is so smart and cute. He is saved. He is all Sonia could ask for. I'm going to stop here, because it is getting late and I am just going to have to go because of church. I will talk some more tomorrow. I will tell you about my other crazy family. I'm going to end this by saying a littlle prayer, Lord, I want to thank you for your many blessings, I want to thank you for everything that you have giving me. Father God, I want to say that I love you, and that I want you to continue to bless thoughout my life, and to bless those that are dear to me, and that are not so dear. I want you to bless those who don't know your word, and the ones who do. Amen

       Hey I haven't been blogging in a while. I don't really have anything to say really, but also I do.   The birds the trees the bumblebees, look at what God has sent to me!!!!!!!!!    *SIGH*  I'm so in love, thank the Lord, I'm so happy what the Lord has set upon me. It feels so good. See the deal is, is that God has sent to me a good man. I mean, me and him have been having the same dreams, I don't go with him, we are trying to get to know each other better now. For the past week we have been calling each other. We have been talking about everything, even the SEX word, he said he wasn't a "V" I said well me either, then at the same time, we said,"but I'm waiting until marriage". After that we sort of starred at each other, as I was looking in his eyes, I saw a loving ,caring, nice young man, who has something going for himself, and love's his Lord(which is mines too.) We was in his car, yea he is in the 10 grade and he is a sophaomore but O well. Yup, he got a car too. Well, anyway for starters he is so not good looking but all right. Which is fine with me. Well, back on the subject. Today at lunch, for the past week he has been taking me out to lunch, like to Mc donalds, then we would go back to school, and eat it. Yea, Mc Donalds aint that good, but hey only 30 minutes and ain't no restaurants around, and he is only a sophomore.We  ust set in his car and ate and talked. When we got done eating our burgers and fries, Hey just a number 1. We all know, it is the Big Mac meal, or the number 4 Quarter pounder or what is it the number 6, Double Quarter  pounder? Then we got on this interesting convo, and then,we started laughing, and all of a sudden we found ourselves kissing. Then after that, he looked at me and was like, I know what is going on with you, and all this time I was thinking no you don't uh what is it? And then he said Aren't you....... (Sonia I told you already). Then I said yea, how did you know, and he said because God told him, and he could tell. I was like what did God say, then he said you will find out, because he will tell you how I know, because he told me to tell you that too. And he told me that I know the D, and that he won't recieve it,and that I just need to let him be there for me, I thought he was lying actually. But I don't know. I do feel he is the one for me, it is so cool, I have no clue, but the Lord told me he was,and it is so good.   MYSTERY GUY??????   See, viewers, as you can see, a couple of my friends are having problems, they met this mystery man, and they don't know his name, they are so lucky, because in the store if i was with Eliza I would have went to him and asked him in front of his MAMA. But you guys are having troubles naming him. So I came to the conclusion of the name,    Sonia- I love you and you think the name should be  Kyle  Eliza- I love you and you think the name should be Kevin.   The the only reasonable name that came to mind should be Kevyle. It is Kevin and Kyle LOL. Well I love everyone good night.

       See, My poem that I am about to publish is called, I don't know that it is called. So just read and evalutate the situation.                          "        "   Its easy to fall in love its also easy to fall out of love. People, they come the go, in and out of our lives, like the oxygen going through our bodies. It's so many things about love, love goes beyond the dementions of the mind, love hurts, love lifts us up. To some people love is so hateful and bitter. To some people love is tender and very caring. With love, a person can love you, and you not give them a chance, also, with love a person can love you, and you always jump at the chance. With love, a person can give you all their time, and all their love,  but you treat them like dirt, put them in your pocket until dark. With love, you can love someone so much no matter what they do let it be good, let it be bad, its fine with you. They could hit you and beat you, and hit you. You won't leave them they will still hit and beat you. Love is blind in this situation this love will become your fatal end.  I don't know what to name this, so if you have an idea just hit me up on Camillecomputer1@yahoo. com you know how that goes.   EVeryone I love you so much,buh bye

       See, My poem that I am about to publish is called words. I will tell you about it after I post it.                              "Words" Say, Power in our words, power to die words have, power to live words have, Distills vivid gratefulness words do. Never dropping never falling intrinsic words are like gravity. Word are words that are powerful they are. Cheetah always catching its prey words are like. Snake choking the last breathe words are like. Light never touches dark, words are like. Never stopping always going words always will.  I will give you all a few minutes to think about that, but if you don't know what I'm talking about, then I will tell you what I'm talking about. Still think, didn't come up with any thoughts, well. The poem is called words, and this poem is generally stating that, words have power, word can be up lifting or head dropping, what ever you say takes a toll and has an effect on people, you might not know what you say at the time you say it, but what you say have power, the words you spit out has so much power in them, the words that comes out of you mouth can sometimes save a life, and sometime take a life. Words have all different meanings to them, and words are always going to have meaning. Okay, that is what is was about.   With that said I love you all. BUH BYE.

       Firstly, I want to say rappers or not. In my book rappers are not to me. I don't listen to the music, but it's hard not to, if everyone at your school and work place is always listening, talking about, or singing the songs. Secondly, I want to say, what is up with the lyrics. Some rappers and singers just make up stuff, and assume it sounds good.  I wanted to say this since I don't know how long, this is the perfect time to say it.   ASHANTI  - Lil non singing butt needs to sit down some where. She gets on my last nerves. With all this  (AW BABY OH BABY)   you know what shut the mess up baby thats what she need to do. ( RAIN ON ME, OOOH TAKE THIS PAIN FROM ME, I DONT WANNA LIVE I DONT WANNA BREATH TIL YA JUST)  SOMEBODY please rain on the lil girl, you see her straining her non singing voice begging for the help. Look you all better hurry up too, she about to kill her self up in here. The thing is, is that JaRule done got on her last nerve. Thats why she wants it to rain on her. The reason she asking for the pain to go away, is because she can't sing, her voice is straining her voice is straining. She need to take a break, if she don't she going to be doing Old Navy commercials. Only George Jefferson's wife won't be on there, it will be her. You all know how weezy Jefferson sounds, that's why they call her that. All that weezing. Next thing you know ASHANTI is going to be the one up there talking about, (  Old Navy Old Navy ).   OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH NNNNAAAWWWWWW  LUDACRIS - What the mess, is he doing, he need to sit down. (  Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless Feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace ). UM yea what ever luda just said, don't make sense to me. Anybody in there right mind don't want no miget hanging from no necklace. He don't know what to do with his money thats what to problem is. (No pork on my fork, I don't even SPEAK pig latin) Lada your a rapper, we wouldn't exspect you to know pig latin. But Pig Latin is so easy I don't know how u don't know how to speak it. It basically english. HUh LUda get ya but in church boy. OOOOO this this this part ( One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you ) He didn't know what to put, so he came up with imagination, or it could have been all of that weed, he was smoking. I don't know what it is. I surely don't want to know why he got inspired to write stuff like that.   OOOOOMMMMMMM  CHINGY  - What is he doing, go back to the dirty south. Do what you was doing before you started rapping. Ok. (  I though of a rabbit the way she bouncing fo thurr curr Her man defendin her like a lawyer so bewarr So dudes be handcuffin but dirrty dat aint farr I wanna bet she got da Bomb like a terrriosy    uh YEA thats making me scratch my head. I am tired of saying stuff like this so last but no lea, well yea last and last. The one that tops them all    Missy Elliot - What are you doing girl, You must didn't have nothing better to talk about, other than passing dutches, you the only one that I heard make a song out of passing dutches . But you a little to to to to to deep for me. Man woman, what is u doing out there( If you a fat one, put your clothes back on Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn  ) Scratching my head again I don't know what that means. You can't talk about nobody being fat, why would somebody who use to be fat talk about fat people, don't get me wrong, you can blow back up, then what are you going to be saying. ( If you a skinny one dont come in my yard before you dig a hole and get stick and then when we turn the lights off we will see how u glow in the dark), what missy what. I'm not suprised if you use that. LOL I'm not surpised  Well, I have to go, I always end with shot outs so I just want to say I love everybody.  GOD BLESS and goodnight.

       This is just a poem that I wrote, I think it says a lot, and me as well just wanted to write poetry. I like poetry. I feel that when I write poetry then everything that I'm feeling, going through and thinking is coming out. Its like when I feel hurt, and I write it down, it makes me feel a tad bit better, and that is good. This is called all out, so let me gone and write it.                                                                                                                                        "ALL OUT"        As I see as I saw it, I have no clue what it is. But yet its clear. The way I have known as I knew it, it's all out. False sayings of mindless matters.    As I feel as I felt it, it was a part of me. Seeking higher authority, I have found, to feel that this mystery deep down inside is forgiven. To receive what it's supposed to receive, finally did it receive.    As I know as I knew it, a bright image, standing in front, questioning higher authority about it. Picked out the bunch I have known in my life. This image was placed to help. Through the false saying I have deceived, the bright image that was placed in front.    As I think as I have thought about it, the mindless matters and the false sayings, over came the mystery. Bright image revealed the revealed as it already was revealed. It's all out, forgiven by both, the mystery has overcome all. Light broke through, finally a new day has come this way.                                      That's about one of the best poems that I have written. It means a lot to me, and I tend to keep it and read it when ever I can. I have realized something deep. Its to deep to explain, my life was planned for something great, and to let it just go down the drain with lies is so not good. Well enough about this convo.                                     *Change*   I like my classes this semester, I see straight A's this semester. OM, today to girls got to fighting, a black girl and a white girl. The scenerio is, is that they was walking from lunch and the white girl called the black girl out her name, or the opposite of a male dog. The black girl stole off, and picked the white girl up and slammed her down hard. Then she started drilling her in her face. When it was all over, the white girl had a bloody nose and a toof missing. (Yea I sad toof, but aint that how we say it these days, he I'm keepin it real) Then when the teachers started to come, the black girl ran away, and for the whole day, didn't know body tell the teachers who it was. I wanted to tell, but uh, that's not my business, and if I do, they might try to get me on something. That's why if I have to go to court I'm not going too. They might try to get me on something. But back to the story, nobody (teachers) couldn't find the black girl, they didn't even know who she was. I know who she is. She had on a black hoodie. When I saw her at my lunch, she was just standing when everyone was walking, I was thinking, man she is a runaway slave, if she don't want to get caught she better take that black hoodie off. I showl took my black hoodie off.( yea I said showl.) Because kids was going around say, its a black girl with a black hoodie, when they said that it was like all eyes was on me, so I said Oh no hu hu no. So I took it off. See, they might try to get me on something. I aint goin. I hurried up and took my hoodie off. shoo they aint gettin me on no false stuff. Would leave with shot outs but uh, maybe later.   Well I said enough so goodnight.

        BRIAN BRIAN BRIAN    Even though he wasn't my blood brother I still loved him like he was. He was my bestes brother. I loved him so much. The last time I saw him was December something, I forgot the day. I realized that you don't really realize how much you love something or someone until something bad happens or you lose them. Now, Brian and me. I kind of took our relationship for granted, because I just knew that I would see him again, I just knew it. I was even looking forward to giving him his Christmas present. It was this Rocawear hoodie. He wanted it so I bought it for him, but I didn't even get a chance to give it to him.   I was especially thinking about his kids. Because one of his daughters came to my house and said hey where is my dad. Where is my daddy. I didn't know what to tell her. So I started crying and I went in my room closed the door and just started to pray.   I loved him so much I was trying to get him to go to church with me all the time, he kept telling me that he ain't ready to get saved yet, and he ain't ready to commit to the Lord. He still wanted his girlfriends, and his parties, and his drinking. I kept telling him and telling him, but that's all I could do was tell him. It's ok, because I feel that I did my part. What ever happenes is between him and God.                                                      *CHANGE*   Let me just get this off my chest. Eliza, I decided to tell you this before 2003 was over, because I wanted to start out fresh, but I couldn't catch up with you. So I'm just going to say it while I remember. I probably apologized but I don't feel like I did good enough. So, I just want you to know that I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for what I did. I'm sorry for just all of that stupid crap.  Sorry for my stupidity. I mean that was stupid. I hope you can forgive me. Just want you to know, if you do forgive me. Please don't bring it up anymore. If you do forgive me, then I already know that you won't forget, but just don't bring it up everytime something goes wrong. I hope you know what I mean. This is 2004, and what ever was in 2003, we should just let it stay there. So, from here, I just want to say I'm sorry, I'm sorry and I'm sorry. Don't forget, when we meet again, you need to beat me down, I'm talking serious beat down. I'm talking broke nose. Ok, maybe I'm not talking about broken noses. Because have you ever saw what a broken nose looks like? It's a hump in the middle of the nose. So, don't hurt me that bad, but at the same time hurt me that bad. You to Sonia, you too.                                          *CHANGE*   I just want everyone to know that I really changed, I changed my spiritual, physical, and mental appearance. Remember all the  GUCCI , all that expensive stuff. That's cut out. I don't wear it no more. Because I was at this store looking for pants, and then when I came out it was this girl about my age (17) she was with her parents, she was asking for the same pants that I had, her mom was like no because she don't have that kind of money, and we all know if you know Martina, she got that kind of money. So, I was thinking, how can I get so mad when I don't get these expensive clothes. When it is people out there who can't even get it. I get most of the things that I want. But there is people out there who can't even get what they want. So I just cut all of that out.  Leaving wit the shot outs!!!!!!     Sonia - Nice talking to ya, its always nice talking to ya, your my girl I love you so much, your just another best friend. Have to tell me about your Christmas, Birthday,and New Years girl.   Eliza - Nice talking to you too, you know it's always nice. Love ya love ya love ya and double times over divided to the 5th power of the inequality of 14 and a half times 6 the the 6 power with the expression of sin. Okay yea what ever I just said. But once again,  I'm sorry Elizabeth. Elizabeth, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. ELIZABETH CAN U READ THIS, MARTINA SAYS SHE IS SORRY. ELIZA, SORRY. LIZ SORRY. ELIZA SORRY. Okay, I hope I got my point across.  I know I said once again, but I just mean it, from the Pulmonary Valve, Right Atrium, Right ventricle, to the Superior Vena Cava, to the Aorta, I'm sorry. The the bottom pits of my heart the the upper pits of my heart I'm sorry. Hope you forgive me. You have to tell me about your Christmas, and New Years  I think I put enough just want to say BYE and God Bless

       Hey foks, I ain't blogged in.... uhhhh...... well I aint blog since last time I blogged. Firstly, I have a lot to say. Secondly, its the same thing as firstly, its just to the second power, thirdly, well its not a thirdly, i put it because i was on a role.   ANYWAYS   How is all my fellow blog peps. Me non just doing iight i guess. I have to say that all this time I spent away from blogging, I felt left out, because I haven't been blogging. But I always make time to read blogs, but I never have time to write them. Well actually I have all the time to right, except uhhhh I just didn't get the blog filling. But now as I should say... I got the fillin ooooo baba baba I got the fillin yea ohhh yea I got the ooooo fillin. Okay, that wasn't exactly Fred Hammond but uhhhhh, that's and oldie. Classic if ya like Jackson 5.   The firstly I mentioned earlier  goes like this, See, I know some people, and some people knows me. Anyway some people found out I was lying and I told them what I said. Then they said they already knew. This is the second time I lied to them. It's also the last. See God put them in my life to help me. ANNNNNnd I know what they are supposed to help me with, but I don't think that they know. Which they don't posed too. Well, after they found out that is when everything started coming together for me. What help me find me was, I let something off my chest that I had carried with me every since I was a little girl. I never told anyone, anything, I really wasn't planning on it. So one night a screen name popped on my buddy list, they said hey whats up. I said hey back. Then we got to talking what about I don't know well I do. BRB I saved the convo so I will tell ya. BACK I can tell ya, see we talked about this, my friend asked me how was I doing i said alright and everything and vice versa, so then i told her me and my ex boyfriend hung out that day and I just got back. After that convo, we got to talking about my bio mom, so i told my buddy, that um i need to call her and tell her thanks for the money she sent me. but before that i told  the dream i had which actually came clear to me in parts. but after that we got to talking about bio mom and how i am going to call, then my bud was like well i gotta think about how it feels on her part, so i told her some stuff that i actually kept bottled up inside of me and i wasnt ever going to let it out,to nobody but i dont know, i dont know why i told this person this, i didnt want this person or other friends of mines to know. I mean i have a best friend a best best best friend she knows nothing about this subject but then this person( my other bud) which i didnt want her to find out I told her and that made me feel much better about myself Secondly, A couple of nights ago, I woke up just woke up, my eyes just jumped open, I got up and i went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror at myself, just staring at myself, and I saw something that I never saw before I saw a person that looks like me but at the same time didnt look like me. This person looked better, she looked like she actually was satisfied with life. And as I was just staring and staring I actually saw how beautiful I was, I mean I am really pretty. I use to be insecure about myself, and that night all of that went away.   Even though I didn't have a thirdly, now I do. Thirdly, I finally feel happy, It took me a bunch of lies and two new amazing people to come in my life and actually help me to realize and help me see the joys of life and how good life can be to you. And to charish every momment of life. Before I met them I looked at life like ohhhh what the mess its just something. I actually took life for granted, and I thought life had nothing to offer. But I realized that my life has a lot to offer me. My life means so much to me. My life is just one of those things that can't anyone else have of mines. Like ummmmm Sally Joe Bob Sam,( NOTE: This is not a real person) Can't have my life, because it belongs to me, and only me. I thank God for those wonderful young ladies. I think I did my fair share of writing so I'm going to go Bye saying BEACE out.

       I was looking at T. V and I saw Snoop Dogg, on T.V singing his classic. I was singing with him. I forgot what he actually said, so, I said. ( rollin down the street on my big wheel tryna get a happy meal, Laid back, with my mind on my meal and my meal on my mind.)  I forgot where I got that from, or if I made that up. I forgot. Well anyway, I talk to my mother today, Eliza she got me thinking, see, I couldn't look past what she did. But I actually faced my fears, and I called her. I talked to her, she is a nice person. She is really, she is. She said that she's from Africa but she didn't live there, and my dad is straight African. She's going to send me pics and stuff. But this convo, was pretty good. She was just telling me things, and I was just telling her stuff, and it was good.   I had a good day with Ahmad, I didn't mean to make you upset. I'm sorry, but when we talked and me comforting you, I liked that. I liked comforting him. I liked the whole day, I don't regret a bit of it at all.   I love all of you guys, bye bye.

       I talked to my biological mother today. I told her to really tell me about where I was born, and where I'm from, and everything. She does look african for real. So, she told me that, she didn't tell me this but, I'm pure african. She's from africa, my dad is from africa. I asked her why did she tell me my dad wasn't. and never sai she was. She said because she didn't want me going around thinking more of myself, because I'm different from everyone else. I told her that I have always thought that I was different from everyone else. She didn't say anything except uh huh. I see. Then I told her to tell me more about me when I was little and young and stuff. I told her to be honest because I want to know. She said I was born in Abuja Nigeria, which is true, about me thinking another place in  Nigeria, but I had the birth places wrong. But she told me about the place and stuff. Then I asked her when did she move here, she said when I was a year. I asked her why don't I have a nigerian name she said I do but when she moved she changed it because when i look on my  birth certificate, it says  something else, she was very quiet, so I didnt' speak about that much. But then I kept wondering, so I asked her what is my Nigerian name then, she was telling me what it was, it is pretty neat, when I talk to you not on the computer I will tell ya.Then she told me about how she was on drugs and this is what she said" Losing you was the worst thing that could happen to me. When I was on drugs  I wasn't myself, I didn't know how to take care of you, you where something different something special. And being on drugs was a bitch". I said  ok. So really now, tell me about my father? She told me some things about him and all. I'm not going to say, because that is another chapter of my up and coming book. Before I pass away, I hope to write a book about my life, and how I grew up. But anyway, my mother and I had a good convo, it is the first convo, that actually didnt seem mental. But I'm going to go   I love all yall peps BEACE

       Welp, guess what, it is not getting along, and commitment. Don't want to commit right now, want to see other girls. Don't even know why he broke up with me. Okay, maybe I do. But its cool. I think he broke up with me because I'm moving to chicago, and he wants to see other girls. Which is ok. But I'm going to move on, and it is a message her. I'm just gonna kick this dream down, at let you'll know about it a few minutes, but I'm not going to put it on here, because my ex now as in YOU will read it. Can we just be friends, well sure. If ya really want. I don't know what to say. You said you really haven't had a girl, so you want to see other people to see what they are about. I understand that. I'm not mad, I'm not saying to much, because I did bogish in relationships, and its my turn I guess. But its cool.  I'm moving on its over its finished. Peace.

       I feel the same way friend, and I will always love this you the same, but for real. Find another love, I know you say your going to do what makes you happy, and you said you want me to be happy, so what will make me happy is if you find another love, I mean Yea, I know your still going to love me, but I want you to be happy, I want somebody to love you as well.    *Change*   I wrote a poem after I hung out with Brandon yesterday, did he inspire me? No he didn't. When you read it you will see, I don't think that it is the same as the other, but I hope you get the message and I hope it is good. It is longer than the other one, and I still didn't name it, ELIZA I need your help on naming it also, if you want or can think of a name. Well here is the poem.   Looking out the window, it was a bright and sunny day, This is the kind of weather for me, let me go and take a look, I opened the front door and something amazed me, I saw a reflection of me, it was where I have been, not where I wanted to be. The reflection lived life to destructively, a reflection of imperfection a life full of uncertainties. Go through this, and that and  the other, living life in the wrong way. Not knowing to keep on going, scared to live life day by day. Feeling sorry for what it has become, no longer caring for life's good things. Thinking death is the only way. Not knowing where to go, or what the next day brings. In a room of darkness deciding its on fate. With the knife in its hand, even more life it began to hate. Thoughts filling its head, what will people think, if I just kill me? I love my momma to death after she finds out, will she still love me? What about the rest of my family, what would they do? Do they even care, they don't even know what I'm going through. Minute after minute I kept on thinking, if I kill myself, what I sow is what I will reap. With the long sharp knife up to my wrist. I didn't care about me I wanted my life to be gone. When I was about to cut, ringing the phone did do, I thought my mom would answer, she thought I would too. I put down the knife and went to go answer the phone. The voice on the other end said I was about to hang up I didn't think you was home. With silence through the air this person knew something was wrong. What's the matter Martina, what's wrong with you? Nothing Nothing, it's not important. The person didn't say a thing, but still knew. Come on Martina your to quiet something is the matter, you can tell me. At this moment I wanted to be left alone, but this person I was talking to wouldn't get off the phone. Wanting to hang up I attempted to do, suddenly this person said I love you, and God does too. I found myself in tears because those words were to strong. I told this person, in a shacky voice, I need help, it feels like I don't belong. How so Martina, tell me I want to know. I can't tell you, I think I better go. Okay, Martina, if you want to talk, you know I'm always here. Approaching my room thinking about giving up, my end was coming near. Picking up the knife on my wrist I was ready to let it all go, but ringing in my head constantly thinking about what my friend had said, and that was God loves you too. Why did I allow myself to get here, what the person told me I already knew. Putting down the knife running to my mom I hugged her, she asked me what's the matter what happened to you? I couldn't do a thing but cry, she looked at me and said Martina you don't have to tell me, I know what you were going to do. I looked at her real strange, thinking no she doesn't, she's just saying that. She said Martina, you were going to kill yourself weren't you? How did you know that? She said baby, I know you, I know your upset about things, you can talk to me. I was thinking no I can't your not saved, besides I'm hurting spiritually. My mom said now lets go to bed and talk tomorrow. I went to my room I began to pray, I was crying, crying,and crying. It seemed like I knew just what to say. I laid on my bed and started thinking about me. The next day I got up and thanked the Lord for letting me see another day, looking out the window, it was a bright and sunny day. This is the kind of weather for me. Let me go and take a look, I opened the front door and something amazed me, I saw a reflection of me, it wasn't where I have been, it was a reflection of what I have come to be.   I hope you got what I put I hoped you liked it, I want to know what you thought if it. But you probably couldn't understand it, but anyway, I'll talk to you later bye bye.  Eliza- I know, your so right. Umm, yea it is clear now, I tried to write a poem about it,but the words wasn't coming to me. It was going to be named confused. But oh well maybe its best I didn't write about it.  Sonia- Girl u know I love yas big up to you and your car.  Ahmad- You need to move on. In a good way.

       I know this is unhealty, but today around 7 I cleaned my white shoes and shoe strings, for work tomorrow, but I used straight bleach, a ton of bleach, I feel like I'm going to pass out. I still smell bleach and it is 10:00 what is really going on, I didn't tell my mom, but I think I gotta go to the hospital. I don't feel good, only because of the bleach, this is the reason I'm not on, the other reason is, is that I'm probably talking to my boyfriend. well I gotta go, because I feel worse, BEACE

       I don't exactly know what to talk about. Umm, Well, I talked to Ahmad after a long convo, after Sonia had to go(on the phone that is) I talked to Ahmad , and we let each other know that we just got to move on for real. Because if we don't we are just going to be 2 people who won't experience love. Me I have Brandon of course, I talked to him, I mean I had to for real I had to. If you have been around you would know why actually. Uh we are all right, our relationship is ok. But after the talk with Ahmad, made me realize how much I love Brandon. I love Brandon, I can say that now. I would say it at first and not mean it but now, I really do mean it, but we have to build the relationship back up, which is good. But things wont be forgotten.  Well, today was a nice day at school, or well not so school. See, today was a half day, so I only had vocational, so right after vocational I got to go home early everybody got home at 1:30 I got to go home at 11:00 so cool so cool. Didn't do anything when I got home except talk to Brandon more, and talk to Ahmad some. I want to talk to Eliza and Sonia, but they are busy so I won't bother them that much.   I'm not making fun of anybody, but for real, I'm not on the whole shaving your eye brows off and then coloring them in with a color pencil or a permanent marker. (I know thats not what they really use come on now I'm not that stupid) But I always see this woman on the bus in the morning time, she has her eye brows shaved off and like she don't even color them back in in the right place, she color them where her hair line is. Everytime I see, her I just say Lord Bless her.  This is for the fellas. FELLAS come on ima be real for a minute. If the length of your hair stop in the middle of your head, then please dont get braids, that not good fellas thas not good. And another tip for the fellas, I don't like pants sagging but if you gonna have your pants sagging past your booty, then Please let me say it again Please where clean dross. I saw this dude in my gym glass sagging his gym pants, and his underwear was all dirty I'm talking highway dirty, road lines all in his dross I'm like nasta. Then on top of that,  (*deep in hale*deep exhale*) he had holes in them, come on now for real. YUkky.  I'm  going to target my sistas too. I see this a lot. SISTAS if you are gonna wear thongs, (*deep inhale*deep exhale*) then make sure you dont wear hip pants IT AINT CUTE IT AINT CUTE.  One of my friends, she wears them all the time, she sits right in front of me, I dropped my pencil and i when in front of my desk to pick it up, and what did I see, I saw a thong and a crack just staring at me. When she move it would laugh. That was gross nasty, I know she felt that.  Yes Yes I have some thongs but do I wear them NO NO NO I wore them once, Why? because I hate my panty line showing. Why don't I still where them? Because I put on some, and the string was in my butt, I don't like things in my butt don't posta be there. And it was very tight and it felt like it wa cutting off circulation there also.  Im attacking my grandmamas now. GRANDMAMA'S I know dressing up is fun for yall but for real. It ain't cute when you where Pants( as in sweats) with GRANDDADDYS thick white knee high socks, on top of that WITH DRESS SHOES grandmamma please come on it aint cute.(Don't beat me if ya read this).  But I don't have anything else to say, so I'm out  I love all of yall BEACE

       I had a busy day today. The CNA certification testing was today, How did you do on it Martina? Well, I did fairly well(a passing grade that is). Me and some friends combined answers after the test and see what each other missed, or didn't miss. I missed some, but not all of them. Other than that today was good. The waking up late was very good for me. Sonia I should have listened to you, and not thought about it that much, but I couldn't help it, then when I actually read some questions, it made common sense. LOL. I'm thinking about putting this poetry on here, well I will do it, because I really was feeling this one. It meant a bunch to me, the funny thing is I didn't name it. The thing is is when I don't name some poems, they really mean a lot to me, its really what I feel, but when I do name some of them, I really don't feel them, I'm not really motivated, I'm just writing to be writing, but this one I really felt. So. Eliza, could you help me name this one too????  It's not in any verses, because I didn't have time to put them in any.     Eagerly I try to find a place of tranquility. Entering a mystificated room something engulfed  around me. Sorrow, pain, fear, and groaning. Overwhelment from these feelings I came to show, I found myself becoming part of the room, exploring the unknown. I reached out to touch hope, I felt my life slowly falling away, but with my hand outstreched, I touched pain, yanking my hand back I felt more afraid. Thinking I should try again, I don't know if thats the right thing to do. Gathering up animosity, I will not make this my fate, on my feet I suddenly flue. Feeling good feeling happy, what  happened next I couldn't believe. I found myself in the middle of an ocean, I didn't feel relieved. Trying to swim ashore, everytime I got closer to my destination, I see I'm farther away from it, even the more. Caught in the strong waves, my arms are getting weak, I can't give up or show fear, I can't be beat. No longer swimming somebody help me, I'm sinking. Nobody's nowhere to be seen. I'm now suddenly shrieking. I'm trying to swim above the water, to catch my breath, panicking, suffocating, gasping for air, my eyes getting big, my end was coming I was aware. No longer breathing air filling my lungs, no longer fighting maybe this is where I belong. Slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea, unconciousness came over me. Strong  hands I felt around me, pulling me out, hearing loud sounds, a voice did shout, "SHE HAS A PULSE HURRY" People came they saved me, what happened next was a catastrophy, of my surroundings I was not aware, I found myself in a burning building, I couldn't get out, I coudn't go anywhere. Running to the front door, the fire beating me here,turning and running to the window, the fire I began to fear. I couldn't move, I couldn't budge, I could just say please. Nobody cared, nobody's there, they couldn't hear my screams. The roof caving in on me,the fire getting larger, Nowhere to go nowhere to hid, thinking this is my destiny. When all hope was lost, I turned my head to see, a translucent light it overwhelmed me. Not taking my eyes of the light, the fire didn't scare me, running towards the light fighting all impurities. Running into the light, I've been set free. I seeked what I was searching for, the tranquil place is near, the more I walk the more I see, it came more opulently, that I had it all along, not knowing how to get it out, you see, but then I became aware, the tranquil place was inside of me.     That is the poem my momma is jumping stupid so I better get off. BYe all tell me what u think. TO ALL I LOVE ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!

       I'm talking about this job at Lone Star, did I get it, well just read what I'm typing and see.... I went in for an interview, I talked to Sonia, and my Cousin, and things, they gave me some pointers on this interview thing. The first thing is, is Sonia, you said it would be ok if I wear a skirt. I was thinking a blue jean long skirt, if you didn't know what I mean, but the interview rule book. (Dress for Success for Women) says that you shouldn't wear a long blue jean or long skirt period. Then it said look at what the employees wear. I said hmm they wear blue jean pants. So I put on some blue jean pants, and a blouse, a nice looking one at that. So I went in with my nice outfit on btw( i didnt have on tennis shoes so dont worry my out fit was pretty dressy yet casual) and I talked to Mark the manager or hiring manager. As I went in..............  Mark:  Hello.  Martina:  Hi.( with a smile and a firm hand shake)  Mark:  Would you like a drink?  Martina:  No thank you.  Mark:  O.k have a seat in the corner. (Mark going into the back, me walking to the booth in the corner.)  Mark:  Coming back..... with my application. So your recent Job was REMCO, what is Remco?  Martina:  ( sitting across from Mark) Remco is a company that I worked for during 01. It was more of a temporary Job.(((((( dope why did I just say that.)  Mark:  uh huh.. So what did you do at Remco?  Martina:  Well, I distributed material from one place to another. I handed out material to kids in the community. Then I went and cleaned up parks in the community.  Mark:  (shaking his head up and down like he actually knew that before I said it.) ok. So Martina. What have you been doing after this job?  Martina:  Well, I have been baby sitting for my family.  Mark:  How many sibling do you have?  Martina:  I have an older sister, a niece that is older than me, and a nephew. I usually babysit for my niece because she has kids.  Mark:  So your the baby?  Martina:  (with a smile) Yes ma'am(dope why did i say that) I mean sir.  Mark:  I am the baby too.  Martina:  *sigh of relief*(with a bigger smile.)  Mark:  (Looking over my application like he was really interested. So, can you work weekends?  Martina:  Yes, I can work weekends, and holidays.(dope was that to much information)  Mark:  OK. So, are there any questions you would like to ask me?  Martina:  (no not really) smiling big, I had a question but I forgot it.(not really i really didnt have any questions)  Mark:  I don't see any problems with you working for us. I would love to have you work for us. Lets talk about the money, you put down server host, and you will be making 3.30 but with tips you should make min wage.   Martina:  Ok.  Mark:  So, when you mom asks you what is the pay its min. wage.  Martina:  ok  Mark:  Will you be able to come around 3:30 to 4:00? For paper work and orientation?  Martina:  Yes I will.  Mark:  (Standing up, which made me stand up) Well its nice to talk to you. Shaking my hand.  Martina:  Its nice meeting you as well.   Mark:  Have a nice day.  Martina:  You also.   So if you want to know if I got the job of course I did. I'm happy I got back home, I said momma I got the job I got the job, No you didnt Yes i did really you did hallelujah yea i know momma. LOL  About you situation Eliza, keep praying, about it. I can't give you any advice because you probably already know what to do. so, I will leave it at that. But I do know, what ever the choice you make will be a good one, because i know that.   Eliza - I love you thanks for being there for  me even when I was difficult LOL and thanks for all your wonderful advice. Also thanks for praying for me because I truly needed it   Sonia - You also, and i want you to know that i will hopefully not be doing anything fun for my break, the only thing is, is a job now. LOL   Ahmad - I love you too. and keep being a friend like you are, and no matter what dont give up on anything  For everybody else I missed, that probably means I didnt' want to say anything about you, or you just slipped my mind or simply just dont read my blog, so it would be pointless  to say something about cha. but on the other hand if i did put you on and u didnt read that means you still in my heart...  Peace folks cont. form eliza's e mail In my soul I give joy IIIIII give joy, I give joy when I think about............ God Bless I'm out.

       The controversy is over, finished done with. See, I seeked God with my problem, and I always did it, but I knew what I was doing wrong, See I was seeking him, but i wasnt really seeking him. I wasn't giving him what he really wanted. I sat and thought long and hard, and long and hard. Then it dawned on me what I was doing wrong. Well, I already knew what I was doing wrong. Let me just tell you. This took like two days, to accomplish. I had to seek him like I never did before, but also confess my sin, and that is the thing that was tearing me up. The sin, that I didn't confess. I'm not going to tell you the sin, because it has nothing to do with you, just with me. While I was sitting here not confessing my sin, but knowing to confess, the Lord was showing me that his will needs to be done. So, I just confessed my sin. I mean at first I knew what it was, but I didn't think it was a big deal until I got to feeling like I wasn't myself. I mean, after I confessed. I had to do some serious ~~~~and ~~~~~to the Lord. I can't tell you what that is yet. This morning I knew his will was done when I woke up to realize the message that was sent to me in a dream, the dream that was from the past, present, and future. I mean it was so real, with a deep message it showed me what I was, is and is in the future, it showed me two ways in life, it showed me what could happen if I didn't change and it showed me what happened when and if I do change then, when I realized what this dream was saying to me, I changed, I mean I felt very very different. I can't explain it, It feel like I'm happy it feel like I am good, I don't feel the same way, I'm not mad or upset with myself. I came to realize that it wasn't even about what I look like,(which has nothing to do what I'm talking about)but it is just so revealing of how the dream was. It is so amazing. I wanted to write a poem but I couldn't because I was out all day. I called Eliza to see what she was going I had to tell her the biz she said it is good and all. I said yea. I called Sonia, I told her the biz she said all of it is gone, are you sure, ummmmmmmm yea Sonia I'm sure. I know I'm changed also, because.......  I already told you all nobody would hire me. Then when I went out to LONE* STAR with my family, I did a little prayer, then I asked for an application, and a girl gave it to me, then at the end when I went to turn it in, she said would you like to speak to the manager or just call in? I said call in, but then I asked my sister does she have enough time for me to talk to the manager. So, I talked to the manager, and then I have an interview, MONDAY@ I cant remember if it was 4:00 or 30 after. I can't remember, So I was thinking about going at 3:30, and then Sonia told me to do that too, so I will.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I GOT JOY JOY UNSPEAKABLE JOY, THE WORLD DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME, AAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL THAT HE'S BROUGHT ME THROUGH IIII GOT JOY!!!!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  *SHOUT OUT TIME*   Eliza - Woman, thanks for putting up with me, I bet when it comes to me you be like"Lord not my will but your will be done." LOL, sometimes I think that about myself. But thanks for all of the help. Without you JEEEEEZ I don't know. You just know the right things to say, "even if i dont wanna hear them" Most of the time, when I don't want to hear them that means that they are right and true. BIg ups to you....   Sonia - All, that I said about Eliza goes for you too, and I want to tell u that you got some mail coming soon, but don't look up for it, because I didn't put it in the mail yet.   Ahmad - You are a best friend, its ok, I know we don't hang out, I am so busy, I don't hardly be at home when I come home for school, even when I'm out of school I am not home. I'm sorry, Ask Eliza, everytime I talk to her I'm out the house, like on the bus actually, LOL. Umm there is more I need to say to you so, I will just wait until you get online.  BYE ALL AND ALL A GOOD NIGHT  GOD BLESS HAPPY EASTER

       I'm about to drop it, all of it actually. I'm going to tell you what is going on with me. Ahmad, Sonia, Eliza, Chassidy, and Brandon. I'm sorry if I said something that ever hurt you guys feelings, I'm sorry for ever hurting anyone of you guys. From step one, today, I went to Ahmads locker, he wasn't at it, so I hung around, then out of no where I saw some dreeds just bumping down the hallway, hmm who is it, it's Rashad(brother of Ahmad.) Rashad came and hugged me, said hello, I said hey. Ahmad just looked at me and walked past me, he went to his locker, I walked behind him. I said HEY AHMAD I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. He started beating his had on the locker and started to wine a bit. Which I don't blame him. Then I was just trying to tell him how sorry I was. Then he gave me a hug, and I told him,I'M GOING THOUGH RIGHT NOW, SO WHAT EVER I SAID I'M SORRY. He said it was ok, I told him IF I CURSED ONLINE I'M SORRY FOR THAT. I had to go to St. Mary's Hospital so I told him I had to get going. He told me to write him. I wrote him, I'm not going to tell what's in the letter, because that is just between us. See, me and Ahmad got it like that. He wrote me back and I read the letter, he made me laugh in some parts. LOL you a fool ahmad. He made me feel pretty good.  Now for the important stuff, I haven't been talking to people lately. NO one like I wanted to actually. Like I said you guys, its not about you, it is straight just about me. I don't know who I am, I don't know where I'm going to end up. I'm just going through some stuff right now. Don't try to cheer me up except ELIZA because she is the only one that actually can do that. Other than that don't try to cheer me up it wont work. Just continue to pray for me, because I need it. Umm more on me to let you know a little bit more. Like I said I don't know who I am, I probably never will. Like Eliza said, no one knows who they are. I am mad at me. Why am I mad at me? Hmm well good question guys, well, I don't really know. See, that is it, I don't know. I don't know why I'm mad at me. I thought I knew last night, but no it wasn't it. It is something else. It's not you, its only me. It's just me. All me, All about me. Nothin but me. I am not depressed, or oppressed. I don't even think I'm stressed. I don't know what it could be I really don't. I just know that I need something more then I have, I know I want something more then I have, its more of a spiritual think rather than an emotional thing. I feel that I'm seeking for more, but its not there. The way I feel is like I'm seeking what ever it is I'm seeking, and I'm getting mad at myself, because I think I'm a mess up because I'm not getting what I want. (spiritually.) I just get on my nerves, it feels like I'm tired of me, I'm descussed at myself, because I'm not getting what I want. It bugs me because I'm not getting it. I know, it probably sounds pretty complicated, but if it does, I'm sorry. It's just the way I feel.   Shout ins(the opposite)  Eliza- I love you very very much just like education is fundamental, you are essential. I love you so much I don't know what I would do without you. I PICKED OUT THE SKIN FOR THE BLOG SO PLEASE SHOW ME WHAT TO DO AFTER THAT.  Sonia- I love you too. Sorry about the other blog, and how I acted I hoped I explained it to you a little more, I didn't mean to make you mad either.  Ahmad- Thanks for being there for me, you are essential to me too. Love you also.  Brandon- I don't say much about you because, if I talk about you then I really wont have time for the important things, just playing you just are so much to talk about so I just dont write much, because if I write I wont stop typing.   For everybody else I missed, that probably means I'm feed up with all the spit you dish out. sorry hunnies  PEACE

       Am I jealous, no I'm not. If I could be jealous, who could I be jealous off. HMMMMMM well.   Lets just say my ex boyfriend and one of my good friends. Ahmad and Sonia, they have been talking it up every since I have been having mishaps with whats his face, what is his face, oh yea that boy Ahmad, from reading each others blogs,and listening to each others talks, hmm. Well enough said about that thing. See this is it, I really don't like my ex boyfriend talking to my friends that live in Bloomington, how did he ever get her screen name from me perhaps, but I don't like them talking to each other, is it a jealousy thing no it isn't. It is just like some other friend I know not wanting me to talk to a family member, it is quite like the same thing. As far as Ahmad is concerned I don't like him talking to Sonia, why not because I have my reasons, will they respect me enough to stop talking to each other, probably not.How come I haven't said anything about it, because I didn't want to at first, I'm very good at not saying how I feel.   Now Ahmad is talking about Sonia calling him, nnnoooooo that WILL NOT happen. I don't want my ex calling my good friend or the other way around. Why not I have my reasons, is it cruel No it isn't. I just have my reasons. I don't get things like from reading blogs, Ahmad,,,,,,,,, helping with other peoples' problems, I'M ABOUT TO BUST SOME BUBBLES. How you gonna help or even give advice to someone, when you have problems and you need advice yourself, I don't get that. Am I upset nope. What is wrong with me, nothing at all. I just don't want one of my good friends getting to know my ex boyfriend. Am I saying that they will start to like each other no I'm not saying that, then what am I saying, I think you already know what I'm saying. I don't want Ahmad and Sonia speaking to each other....... Period......  As far as shout outs  Eliza- You a good friend lov ya lov ya  Sonia- Ummmmmmmmmmmm yea lov u too  Ahmad- hmmmmmmmm well don't know what to say  Rashad- cool peps cool peps.  Words from you know who

       I might as well tell right now. I'm stressed, because I have been studying medical terminologys since this morning, all day. The big test is tomorrow, and I need to get away. Right after I got done studying my friend called, I talked to her then she had to go, then I talked to her again. Then I talked to my other friend after that.   She asked me what was wrong, I said nothing, but I think she kinda knew something was wrong. I know what is wrong with me, and I don't know. Of course you know I have emotional problems. I think that is it, but i doubt it. HUH, I hate feeling like this, I need to get out the house some. I know if I had of went to church that would've been a whole lot better, and made my day feel a whole lot better.  After I just got off the phone with my friend, I actually laid against my wall and just felt like crying, why I don't know it wasnt because I got off the phone with my friend, its because I'm stressed, I'm still stressed, a little,not a whole lot though. Umm, I'm running out of words,I don't know what to say.  OH my friend told me my blogging style is change, (what) I didn't know I had a style, to pretty much sum that up, I'm a pretty complex person, I do things differently all the time. I do things that I like to do. If I want to write different well, I will just do that. I still didn't get my pictures done, why I don't know, why so still don't know I think I will just go tomorrow and get it done. so I can hurry up and send a pic to my friends. I have been studying all day as I said before over my medical terms, I hate that but I need to do it because this is a matter of passing my class. I really want to pass, and to do that I need to get an impressive grade.   Also, I need to study for the ACT test, which I am going to call u know who to help me with that, annnnnnnnd I'm also going to call you know who,to help with my math, and help me to look at some finacial aid stuff and scholorship stuff, because i need guidance in that and ELIZA you the candidate just for that.   Now for the shout outsss  Eliza- Luv ya girl your my goodes  friend dont really got nothing to say cept i talk to u a little more now which is good.   Sonia- Luv ya too girl you a good friend too.

       As you can see today was a good day for me, I woke up did my daily need, went to school saw some friends which is to cool. Hey that rhymes, cooooooool.  Today I woke up and went outside to wait on the bus, got the bus, transfered down town, with water and a hot pocket in my system. ( I know I got bad eating habits.) Saw friend Chassidy, talked to her all the way to school. She was talking about how she didn't want to do a play for her church, and she said she is 16 and tired of the church foks calling on her to do stuff with out her permission, and she told me her dad don't even do that, which if you don't know by now she is a Preacher's daughter, yep she is Pastor Eubanks daughter. Anywaz,  I told her do pray and then talk to the people in the church, I think she should do it because it is to the Glory and Honoring of the Lord. But her heart isn't there so, I don't think she will be doing that. But after that I walked into the building, a second before that people was like Hey Martina how are you doing? I told them fine and stuff, then they wanna talk, and its 8:00 in the morning I'm trying to get to homeroom because people want to talk and I didn't. They finally left, so I went to my locker, and I put my books up, the the bad thing about that is, is that you know who usually comes to my locker AHEM ( AHMAD ) I didn't even get to see him today, but that is ok, he came up to me after school, and when I saw he cute face, he put a smile on my face, when he touched my shoulder and said hi, and that made me feel real good.   Then I went to the Technical Academy  to my classes 1,2,and 3rd hours I have Health Occupations, so after that I went back to school,and went to 4th hour which is MR. Coolingwood's US History class, which I don't like history, but I'm pulling a B or C in it so, that's not to bad, but me I always settle for a C when I see a C I say hmm ok, and I know I am A material, I just don't wanna do nothing till Senior year which I will be pulling A out of my time of the month like  grandma panties, giiiiiirls u know what im talking about, that is when u reach deep down in the back of the drawer and get the 100% cotton fruit of the Loom or Hanes that are like 3 sizes bigger. For that time of the month. But I will be pulling A's out of those when I turn into a senior.   5th hour is my AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW Math class which i hate it hate it hate it, I am effortless in that class, I don't do no work, which I kinda say ok I don't know how to do this chapter, so I will just wait till the next chapter, but she is probably going to go over chapter 8 again which is iight. Then I wil actually pay attention to it this time. Ms. Pelz its ok, your alright but you can't teach that well I'm sorry hunny. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO what was so funny was on April fools this girl named Altinique went up to the board and wrote I LOVE YOU MR. PELZ FROM ALTINIQUE. Mrs. Pelz didn't do anything but look. Then she was looking mad, so the whole class started singing na na na na      na na na na    hey hey hey    good bye. LOL even me too. LOL. We thought she would be gone out of there with a referral. Everytime somebody gets in trouble or get a referral, we usually sing the song off of REMEMBER THE TITANS. You all know.  Na Na Na Na   Na Na Na Na      Hey Hey Hey     Good Bye!!!!!!!!!   6th hour is Gym I played basketball and killed folks, it was 2 girls playing with all boys they left me open and I boo bood on them. They don't want none of me. The girl of couse I had to block her, so I had the ball and then she said where you going so I fake shot and she jumped up and I pulled a bucket right in her eye, but she got me back, later on she pulled a 3 on me. IN MY EYE which was a pretty sight.  ELIZA THE ONLY COMPETITION SO LOOK OUT WHEN I GET UP THERE PUNK!!!!   7TH HOUR engish Mrs. LOHMANN I love you woman, you are my favorites teacher in the world. I can come in tardy all the time and she not count it, but that's not the reason she is my favorites teacher, she is my favorites because she remebers that she was also a child, see most teachers don't realize that they were once kids, and that they are not the one with all the power and what ever they say goes, no the kids are the eyes to the future. They as in GROWN ups need to listen to us, because they have been through the same thing and didn't like being singled out as since I'm a kid and your a GROWN up what I say goes. NO they felt like there opinions count. That's how I feel.   After school I went home called Brandon, we was supposed to go for Pizza today, but he thought Saturday, and I supposed to get my hair done saturday but afterwards, perhaps Brandon perhaps.   speaking of brandon  he is my boyfriend we went with each other for a month and 4 days. It doesn't feel like it, it feels like 2 weeks actually, but hey what can I say, I'm a good pick Males just flock to me, but I'm very choicy, and I got the one by far.   I'm about to go so I will end with shout outs.   ELIZA - you know  i luv u girl, and about my math well i will do what u want i will call tyrone naw just playing i'll call. Might be getting a Job at St. Mary's. This girl was like yuk your going to work in the laundry department cleaning poop and urine and crap, I said hey I'd rather wash the linen instead of the butt. In May I will be a Certified CNA which is in medical terms a certified nursings assistant or a patient care technician. Which in this Job I have to take care of people. LIke clean there butts and stuff. So I would rather clean laundry. Back to you though, I will ask tomorrow about next week or is it week after next? Hey it's one of those weeks. But I don't think it will be boring to me if I actually go to Bloom.   SONIA - Hey girl you know I love you too, how are ya. I haven't talked to you since what, couple of nights, hey its cool though. How is lift treatin ya. I want to talk to you again. You hold good convo's which is always good to talk to someone who likes to talk. Hey Eliza too. I hope I can take some pics just for u and eliza, I might be gettting another job, for 3 hours a day keeping the Human Resource Building open which is a big job, I will be planning parties, and stuff like that, which is good also.   AHMAD - I love you Feelings for you will never change, I think we are doing better then we are when we was together actually. I liked talking to you, even when we didn't talk that much, I want to talk more too. In person not over the phone, I'd rather prefer person. You understand, so how is the  Social life doing, I hope it is doing alright. Which it probably is, because a couple of shout outs up you have an admirer. LOL HEE HEE.     BRANDON - Love you hope we hangout more, and you need to get something to talk about boy, I'm tired of getting on the phone talking about hey what u do today nothing much how about you oh nothing here either then for like 10 minutes its silence. NO I hate that, but I don't care because I love you. And we got lots to talk about in person, but over the phone its nothing. Which is ok, because I like to talk to the person eye to eye, in some cases chest to eye it just depends on how tall the person is. Sometimes toe to eye, hey that is too short but you get the picture.  Well this is the end. I gotta go.         UNTIL NEXT TIME............ LOVE........ PEACE.... AND SOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL.  God luvs you and u know I love you yall God Bless

       Well See, I ain't blogged in a long time because i didnt have anything to blog about, so now i do.  No these are not shout out im just going to tell what is going on with these people.  Eliza- she been real cool, just started back talking to her again, she is pretty busy so i try to call when i feel she is home, which always works. I pretty much can track her down actually. LIke I knew she would be over or going over Sonia's to pick her up to go to the library. Who told me well the person who answered the phone. and if she is at work I can call her at work, because i still got her work number, but i wont call, i dont want a GROWN woman to get fired from her job, but all though she needs to quit she knows and everyone else knows.   I talked to her last night and i opened up to her a little bit more than usual. we talked about things.. that are between us i guess. But i got to thinking of what she said, she told me to look at the optimistic side instead of the pestimistic.  which stung me like a bee when you accidentally put your hand down on a table with the bee there when u didnt know it was thee then u have to go to the hospital because your allergic because you didn have your epi pen and u couldnt get your breath and u have to go the er at the hospital so they can give u a shot.  But thats another story.  Sonia- I just started talking to her lately. I haven't been able to catch up with her because she is also busy. See my good friends are a little older than me so they gotta represent the GROWN FOKS life right? me im still in high school just jellin like a fellin. I talk to her also. She is a really good person like  AHEM uhhhh whats her face oh yea eliza.  FOR REAL THERE I JUST GOT A BRAIN FART, I KINDA FORGOT MY GOOD FRIENDS NAME. WHAT A BRAIN FART THAT IS THE WORSTES,,,, YEA I SAID WORSTES, BUT THAT WAS THE WORSTES ONE I HAD EVER.  man i was like jabari off of College Hill. man uhhhhh uh see uhhh uhh.

Well this person wrote me an em and actually made me realize a whole lot... that i need to see what is here.even more, i actually started talking to this person more after she said that so...   AHMAD- Umm, I still love u you know thats always the deal, and your always going to be in my heart.   LET ME TELL U KNOW BOY IF U EEEEEEEEEEEEEVER TRY TO PULL THAT BIPOLAR MESS ON ME I WILL BEAT U LIKE WHITE ON RICE, A GLASS OF MILK, AND A PAPER PLATE IN A SNOWSTORM BOY, DONT PLAY WITH ME.. other than that u know u a cool person..

        I got joy joy joy Weeping may endure for a night but joy joy joy joy cometh in the morning joy cometh in the morning all that he's brought me through i i i got joy, weeping may endure for a night but joy joy joy joy cometh in the morning  joy cometh in the morning   That was just on my heart, I don't know if I typed it right, but I don't care, I typed the way I feel.      I saw my good friend Eliza, at church last night. My pastor(Pastor Simpson) had to speak, she did very good. She spoke about The Love that we should have. Which is true, and again, she busted a couple of my bubbles.The best part about church was meeting my friend since November, Syyyyyyyyyyyyyk. The best part about church is the Lord that is it. The Second thing is just communizing.(Is that the right word well u know what I mean if its not.) I had to sing of course, Ebony she didn't want to sing, so I pulled her up there. For all of you who don't know Ebony she has a natural hair style, No chemicals no nothing and she has it in a bob or an afro.She has it dyed read with her natural hair sticking up under it, which makes it nice to look at.I wish she could of brought her three kids, but they was with there daddy so, that is ok I guess. Back to church, I was telling Eliza, that I'm changing for the good this time, because I'm just tired I being holy then turning around and freaking around with folks, then become holy again. I can't do that, I can't I have to do one or the other. I can just see what the Lord has done for me, and with me getting in the world again, that delayed the blessings that the Lord is giving me. AND ANOTHER THING I cant see why I complain about how much I get paid on my job, and how much I hate it WHEN THE LORD BLESSED ME WITH THE JOB ANYWAY... I just started to take my job for granted actually. I kinda started to think I was too good because I have a job now, WHEN THE LORD GAVE ME THIS JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE. I just busted my own bubble. Which actually felt good. LOL well I better go PEACE  SONIA- You are truly missed, by me and eliza and ahmad, and who ever else I bet. I went to u guys church and I hugged eliza, and we talked then she looked at me and said I miss Sonia, I said yea yea well yea. Because I miss you to and I know what she is saying. (with your sweet voice i miss that ooooooooo and you laugh too lol)  ElIZA- It was nice seeing you again, and I do have a big butt, but I don't really think it is big I think it is flat, people think its big and round a plump my mom and pastor and people at school things that but when I look at it myself its not.  AHMAD- I hung out with you the other day, and it was pretty good. I hope you don't think I'm nasty now, and after I did do that, I realized how much of a sin that I committed,and so I'm actually back on the Lord side again. Well trying to get to the place I was before. Please don't ask why I did it, I don't know, I guess because of the mood I was in. But please believe that will never happen again, even if I get married. Nobody knows what I'm talking about except me and you, so that is it.If you tell someone I will cut your ears off LOL just kidding, but for real its just our business.  Renita- My sister I love you girl and I just want you to know that I will always be here, and I know you will always be there, and I thank God your in my life, becuase I feel we can better our sistership or relationship as sisters. I just want to say, when we first met, you said we have a lot of catching up to do, and what I told you after that is what I meant. I told you no we don't we can just start from here, starting from here, and catching up is so different, even if we tried to catch up we couldn't. So, we can just start from here. If we start from here, I feel that it would be best because we can have so many good times. If we just catch up those are some good and bad times. I don't want any bad times. Just good times.   I know I missed a lot of folks but o well. PEACE

       Hi again all, I know you probably are to busy to read my little old blog which is alright, but like I said you never know what a person is going through until you go through it. I basically was hanging over ahmad's house just having fun and stuff watching mad tv just about all day, but then he came to me and was like you not acting yourself i know something is wrong now tell. I didn't want to tell because I really dont want or didnt want anyone to know a side of me that they have never seen and I was going to cry if I told him. I said no I wont tell, then he thought that I didn't want to tell him. That wasn't it, I didn't mind telling him, because I knew he wouldn't tell anyone else, and I knew I could trust him, because he is a good friend, not just to me but to anyone he knows. But I told him what the matter was and so I started crying and all and I felt good but sad at the same time when I told him what I've been going though. We was sitting on his porch away from everyone when I told him, I started crying, I just broke down just balled out, I know crying isn't a form of weakness, because its good to cry, but I cried so hard, I really felt hurt, I cried so hard that I couldn't talk that good, I cried so hard my eyes looked like I was smoking weed. I just cried, that cry was a hurt cry it was a, I want to get away from all and everything cry. Literally I felt like how can I go on living like I'm living? I felt like I couldn't take it anymore, just let it all go, but I didn't, I contained myself very well. I looked over at Ahmad he wanted to cry, I told him not too. I take it he understood because he said he wants to help me and all. He felt sad for me and sorry for me, he kept telling me he was sorry even when it wasn't his fault. I told him I don't like when people feel sorry for me, please don't feel sorry for me. I know he still is going to feel sad because of what I'm going though, but this has been happening all my life. I'm ok with it. I feel sad at times but always pray. I pray and pray, and I'm still in the same or my family is still in the same situation, but all I can do is pray. I'm going to keep on praying, because I will be happy in the long run. But for real I am very secretive. I am very good at hiding my feelings from everyone, I'm very good at a lot of things. Out of all that I have been though I have grown more mature. Out of all that has happened, I have grown mature from all of it. I am doing my best to do my best. About Ahmad, yes I used to hurt him and do him wrong but I feel really bad about it all, because I know that he is a good person, a good friend. He is a good everything. I just was immature, and didn't see that earlier in my life. Now that I'm older, I understand that I hurt many individuals and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I'm sorry for me. Especially what I'm going though. People want to know why I did this and that or said this or said that to them, I can't even give them an answer, what I can say is I'm going though right now, I mean I'm really going through, no one knows, because I act like everything is fine.........   It was good talking to Sonia, I'm happy for her, she has a lot going for herself and I'm happy for that. God Bless Sonia     To all love everyone Eliza Sonia Ahmad Donavan Kayla Kariem Rashad, everyone else I missed I'm sorry I'm still thinking about you also.

       Have you ever talked or even knew someone who had a one track mind? Have you ever tried to help someone see that there are other options other than one? But yet they still don't see and you still see that they are still going to look at one thing a dwell on it. I know a person like that, as much as I try and try to tell them that no, this and no that and no that will happen and no this wont happen, and no that's not right and yes this is right, and try to tell them that the only thing is them and they have to do this and that for themselves, it just doesn't go through to them and it hurts me when that happens. When I say something it gets all twisted up into this person's thoughts to the point that its not right at all. I get so sick and tired of that, to the point to where I just don't care, just want to say you know what, don't talk to me anymore because I'm trying to help you out in your life, and all this negativity is bringing me down. I am so happy I don't need to be brought down. I pray for them and pray for them, and it just seems like thats not working, and the thing that I can do is keep praying. I just don't know, I think I need to do what on my mind whatI think that both of us need to do, and that's to not talk at all, but how to I tell this person with out hurting this person. Nobody knows who this person is, it could be somebody you would least exspect or barely even know. Or it could be somebody that you knew for a long time. It could be a family member or just a friend. The thing is no one knows this person but me. So, who is it a she or a he, well in do time everyone will know. About D he is a real cool person still a good friend always he is always going to be there for me and me him, I already know what I'm getting him for his birthday, and Eliza for hers. Because they are in the same month near the same time as well so thats good also. Renita is out of my life for good, I wasted to much time talking to her, she got mad at something that didn't even concern her,but is ok&nbsp;I know&nbsp;I&nbsp;have a sister and thats that she goes on with her life&nbsp;I go on with mines thats the end. &nbsp;But I have to go, so I will talk to you later bye bye Love you all each and everyone

         Just another days journey and I'm glad gladdddddd so gladdddddddd I can see how far you brought me and I'm glad glaaaaaaaaaaad so glaaaaaaaaad........        &nbsp;   Yep, well I&nbsp;haven't talked to anyone in a while, Ahmad told me he was still in love with me,&nbsp;but I don't like him like that, only as a friend, and instead of being in each others presents, we tried the avoid each other, to see if he can get over me.   Now it is this guy named D we have been having friendly conversations over the net. He lives, in Rockford I live in Decatur, my cousin introduced us, I don't like him like him, I like him as a friend if there is room for progress hey, but its on him.  He probably doesn't like me like which I don't think he does, but he is working on his singing career so most of the time he is sleeping at home or out in the studio or at church, which is excellent. Good for him. He loves music, like me, and he loves poetry like me, we really have a bunch of things in common, we have been talking for about I don't know how long, and it is good because we clicked without showing pictures, but I am curious. I'm not going to just spill spill the beans just sprinkle a little of them. Well I'm going to switch the subject off of D.....   I text messaged Renita on my phone telling her I'm sorry which I don't even know why I did, because I wasn't the one in the wrong. I told her that I am supposed to forgive her and love her because I want to make it to heaven. I told her that I hope she can forgive me, even though I didn't do anything. She was supposed to send me some mail(money) I didn't recieve it but the little argument we got in, I probably would've just send it right back to her, besides she's in a little hard spot right now so I would probably send it back. I asked her for seven dollars, which I can't get now, because I had to buy me some girl stuff, now, its close to that time, and I'm left with no money, The money that I do get is going to church 10% plus offering, which is good.   I haven't talk to my friends(associates)&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know anymore, but I haven't talk to Eliza,&nbsp; or&nbsp;Sonia, in a long time, I'm not going to call, they have my&nbsp;number, besides&nbsp;I have been calling and nobody picks up. Maybe I should call blocked and see if they pick up, no nope I wouldn't do that. That's rude and cruel and I'm&nbsp;done with decieving people.&nbsp;Anyway, let me tell you about my friends(associates) I don't know anymore. Anyway, Eliza, she's your typical workaholic, strive for excellence and perfection.&nbsp;Which sometimes is sickning. I just hope she doesn't get&nbsp;mentally hurt in the long run, what I mean is, is I hope she doesn't work herself into a mental breakdown. She got probably over 2 jobs,&nbsp;plus school, friends family,&nbsp;church, church family, church friends, basically&nbsp;all her surroundings. Now,&nbsp;she's never at home when she is she is sleeping, or busy. She needs to just take a break.  Now Sonia, she's your typical laid back type of girl the college student that's on her own,&nbsp;going for her education. She has so much in life to&nbsp;look forward too.&nbsp;God, her own home, her own education, friends, what more can she ask for, you never know.  That's all on them they probably wont even read this which is ok, if they do hey thats ok too. Anyway me, I have just&nbsp;been the same old me. Some old Martina Camille&nbsp;Nash.  Some people (RENITA) didn't understand that I'm 17 I have my own problems, don't need anybody elses, my own life, don't need to get told how to run it. She just looked as me as a child and she got disappointed when I told her that I'm not a child and she can't control my life, or tell me what to do and what not to do. She probably did miss me and still care for me. But I barely know her, it was like a foreign person visiting a foreign land, or I speak&nbsp;English, and&nbsp;someone else speaks spanish, and we don't know&nbsp;what each other is saying, that is how me and Renita was.  See, when I first met her I knew something was going to go on like this, it was to good to be true. I was also thinking that why&nbsp;now,&nbsp;and not sooner. Took them 13&nbsp;years to find me, it wouldn't have took that long all they had to do was ask DCFS. NOOOOOOOOO they probably didn't do that. Then when she sees that I'm doing good,&nbsp;I have my own things, and I'm basically independent and don't need her, she figured I need her.&nbsp;RENITA IF YOU READ THIS, I DONT NEED YOU, I DIDNT HAVE YOU IN 13 YEARS I DONT NEED YOU FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I forgive you but all you caused in my life was caos. Caos between us, Caos between my adopted family. Which did actually bring&nbsp;me and my adopted family more together. I thing you wanted me to stop and just&nbsp;cling to you and my blood family,&nbsp;OK getting to&nbsp;know&nbsp;the&nbsp;aunties and uncles and cousins was by far the most exciting thing that happened in my life. But you, I'm sorry, all&nbsp;pretty things soon&nbsp;turn bad, they never stay pretty, they shrivel up and whither away. Like our sistership.   As far as everybody else who's in my life thanks. Shoot out to some of the people that's in my life. Friends Family soon to be friends.  Eliza  Sonia  Ahmad  Kayla  Jessica  Erica  Lisha  Donavan  Kariem  Rashad  Jasolin  Chassity  Callista  Angel  Yuliyana( she mexican dont worry)   I love you all thanks for being a part of my life. THANKS

        Hey everybody its me again I just want to say I have made up my mind about what I want to do with my future, no im not going to the national guard thats a real big no no. The thing is is everybody knows my older sister Renita, I was telling her I was going to join she tried to talk me out of it, then I said Im going to do what I want. She said fine click, she hung up on me, so that is no big deal so i know when something big comes along shes just going to click and leave me hanging again. I didn't like that. We aren't going to talk anymore. I don't need her, she aint been there for me in 13 years I dont need her what makes her think I'm going to need her now.  I think she things that she need to give me money when she dont. I don't need her money I got my own money. If she wants to help me, give me money for school shoot. I think she's not talking to me anymore, because she called me a kid, I told her I wasnt a kid or a child and when people step to me thinking im a kid or a child they often feel real disappointed, and I told her that when people often step to me thinking that they can change my lifestyle or my views of life they are very disappointed because im martina this is me and this is who i will always be. There no stopping me no changing me im just me. I really do believe now, that when she had contacted me, it was like she came in my life trying to change me and when she found out she couldnt she thought she&nbsp;could get me with money and she didnt know how to take me when i told her that im very much capable of holding my on income  &nbsp;  I'm a senior now, its shocking, I quit my job at Lonestar, they tried to blame me for stuff I didnt do. They kept doing it so I said no forget it. As far as working goes, I'm a CNA trying to get job 2 I have to get money for college. Education is everything in these time of days. As far as my social life doing, I'm keeping that to myself, nobody's in my life right now. I have a lot of people trying to be in it. But I have to focus on my education, and if the right person comes along then yes, but he has to be sent by God.   In the past year, I have matured into a&nbsp; nice young lady, I'm looking at the world from all directions. Now, I pick the people who I hangout with, I'm getting older Im basically living the life of a saved woman. It feels so good. My female friends, I can say that I only have one, my male friends on only have one so all together I have one friend, then the rest are associates I guess. I'm thinking about going to Berkley college but I don't know. if I get enough money in finacial aid or scholorships I'm probably going to Berkely or Chicago State. If I don't get enough money, I will be going to Richland Community College. I think thats the best thing for me to do anyway.  &nbsp;  I'm going to be going so thats all folks.  &nbsp;

       Just thinking about me, and my future, basically about my life. See, I want to do something with my life, other than what I'm doing now. I want to be more than what I am. I want to be noticed, not just by other people but I want to be excepted in the world, when I know that that's hard to do. But even when you think your excepted your really not.  For instance, I talked to this person, about other people and this person and I had the same issue, and she told me the honest to goodness truth.And it all became clear, and I don't know how to tell this person what I want to tell this person. I mean I have to son or a later, because its not going to make matters better. And this person will never overcome what this person is supposed to overcome.  Anyways, I'm thinking about my career. I don't know what I want to do. I want to be an actress, but I wont have any experience if I go to college and become an RN.   Well I gotta go so I will just update later Bye. P.S My mom gotta make a call.

       I was thinking about my life, thinking about my career, wondering what I want to do with it. Then what kept ringing in my mind was "passions" like I asked Ahmad what was his passion, he loves to draw, he loves drawing that is what his passion is, I asked D what was his passion, he loves music, he loves to sing and write music, thats what his passion is. It came to me that as long as I live I'm going to love acting, acting is my passion, nobody can tell me how to do acting. My grandma asked me what I wanted to do, I told her acting, she says thats not a career, I said yes it is. Then she says your a Christian and acting is worldly. I told her it is worldly if you make it worldly, I don't plan on making it worldly. I was also thinking about how I'm going to make it being an actress, I decided to go to a Performing Arts college, and take up theatrical arts and Drama. I should get a BA in English in the theatrical Arts department, land some rolls as movie extras, enough to put on resume's and BOOM im in. I'm going to go to Columbia College, the way I get in is by auditioning. I figure if I right a play now, and study it, I'm in, if not oh well. But I should get in, of what I have in mind. I love everyone of you guys, PEacE
