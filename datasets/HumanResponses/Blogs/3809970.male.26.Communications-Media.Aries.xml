      I see you've found my web journal. How many times have I come up with a joke in my head, and not had anywhere to write it down. I'll probably use this place to post it...because of course if I don't have access to a pen and paper to write down a joke, I must have be near a computer, right? Don't question my logic, just smile and nod.  Actually, the real reason that I started this is because I've moved to the northeast side of Baltimore, which is pretty far away from most of my friends, so I have a lot of free time...not that I didn't have a lot of free time when I lived in Ellicott City. Or College Park for that matter. Anyway, I'm not going to be one of those morons who puts his or her heart and soul out on the internet and then bitches about it when people read it.  I'll also use this place to post things that are going on in my life, updates on house renovations, updates on Chester the kitten, and updates on the show that I produce. That's it for now.

      Sorry for the lack of updates...like people are really reading this thing. I've been working the 3am - noon (or later) shift all this week, so I haven't been in the mood to do anything but sleep when I'm not at work. Just a quick update today.     I made spaghetti for dinner tonight, vermicelli with mushroom/crushed garlic sauce to be exact. I looked at the back of the box for the spaghetti because I'm trying to cut down on calories, and I noticed that the serving size is 1/8 of the box. Fine, that's not a whole lot of pasta, but what are you gonna do. I just garnish it with a whole bunch of green beans (my second favorite green veggie). So I go to the jar of sauce, and I see that the serving size of sauce is 1/6 of the jar. Huh?!?!     Basically what they're saying is that you need more than a jar of sauce to accurately cover an entire box of pasta. I guess that goes along with selling packages of 10 hot dogs, while hot dog buns come in packages of 8. Basically it proves without a shadow of a doubt that they don't know what they're talking about...and these are the people packaging our food. Of course then again, the pasta sauce is much more expensive than the actual spaghetti...so maybe they're on to something.     I am also making this declaration: Tomorrow shall be stress-free Friday! No particular reason, but I like the title.    Oh well...back to bed. No sleep till Boston! (not that I'm going to Boston, but we're taking the show on the road there, and there's a ton of prep that is going into the week of shows next week.) If you want to listen to the show, it's on from 9-noon EST, and you can listen online by going to  urlLink WBAL.COM , and click on the LISTEN NOW link on the left side. We try to make it fun, and every so often, my voice finds its way on the air. I apologize in advance for anything that I say that offends anyone.

      Obesity is a problem. People (myself included) are too overweight, and not active enough. I'm currently trying to remedy that situation on my own, and that's the way that it should be done...on my own. There are some things that the government should not be involved in, and the "war on obesity" is one of them.  The latest, kids,  is that advocates want the government to get involved in the fight against obesity. Oh, well that is almost certain to work. After all, the government has been on the forefront of such slam dunk wars against drugs, poverty, crime, and immigration. If the government declares war on it, oh surely it will be done.  My main question is, how will the government manifest its newfound preemptive strike against obesity? I picture a few ways:  1. Warning labels on every product that the government deems bad for you. "Warning! Consumption of this porterhouse steak, while satisfying and delicious, may lead you to gain pounds, inches, and shorten your life."  2. Why not have a tax on every pound that you are over "normal?" Have weigh stations that people have to subject themselves to as they are walking down the street. You'll see a sign, "weigh station is open, you must enter before proceeding."   3. How about all-out banning unhealthy foods? That's sure to work. If you can't get your hands on a Twinkie, then you're surely going to live a more active and healthy life!   Sure, banning the food would work, but then what would surely follow. I picture an ad campaign with a bunch of overweight people saying things into the camera like "I helped fund a suicide bomber," or "I helped bring the twin towers down," and then an ominous voice comes on and tells you about the thriving black market of Twinkies, cookies, Krispy Kremes, candy, soft drinks. "Every time you purchase and consume one of these items, money is being funneled back to Afghanistan and the Taliban. Your selfish desire for processed flour and yellow dye no. 5 has fueled the next generation of radical Islamic holy warriors in their jihad against America." Give me a break.  How about government-controlled fitness centers? Can you picture what it would be like in one of those places? "Hi, and welcome to Dubya-Gym, I'll be your personal trainer John Ashcroft. Unfortunately there will be a three hour wait for the stairmaster, can I convince you try out the treadmill? I know it's not what you came in here for, but what can we do...we're the government? Don't you think that your workout attire is a bit too revealing? I'm gonna have to ask you to put this jump suit on."   The bottom line is that the fight against the obesity is a noble one, but not one that will be advanced through government involvement. In fact, if the government gets involved in the fight against obesity, I picture the problem getting to be a lot like the government that is pledging to fight it...fatter. Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

      A fortune cookie. My cat was playing with a fortune cookie. Where the hell did my cat get a damn fortune cookie!?!?     My point exactly. Does my cat have some kind of part time job? Is my cat going out while I'm at work? I try to provide a good home, toys, affection, food, shelter, and this is how he repays me? I wonder if he's curious why they seem to be feeding him all of the time while he's at work? Does he realize they're trying to fatten him up? Well I for one am not going to stand for this. I'm going to march my butt over to that chinese place and give them a piece of my mind. Fortune cookie, indeed...

      I have no problem with cyclists. Some of my best friends are bicyclists...not that there's anything wrong with that. I am not a cyclophobe. I enjoy a good bike ride whether it's on the streets of Baltimore (although I haven't done it yet) or if it's on the boards in Ocean City on a Sunday morning. Cycling can be a healthy, and productive physical activity.  That being said, there is a group of cycling enthusiasts (and I'm afraid of anyone who calls themself an enthusiast about anything other than sports...otherwise I'd scare myself) who have taken it upon themselves to intentionally cause traffic jams as a means of making a social statement. I'm not making this crap up. This group, who call themselves  urlLink Critical Mass,  feel that the world would be a much better place if there were no cars, and everyone would just ride their bikes to work and sing kumbaya. Sorry...not buying it.  This is not an attack on normal cycling enthusiasts...far from it. Like I said, I have several friends whose favorite thing to do is to go out and ride 30 miles on a bike. The difference between the people I know and these yahoos is that they keep it to themselves.   I have no problem with the political stance that anyone takes. I can get along with pretty much anyone who chooses to be reasonable. One of my good friends from college thinks that the twin towers looked like a controlled demolition. Whatever you say, if it makes you happy, then go with it...just don't expect me to buy into it. The world would be a pretty boring place if there were no dissenting opinions.   This goes beyond expressing one's opinion. This is a danger to public safety, or at least it could be. Say these protesters are busy staging a traffic jam for the sole purpose of educating us about the evils of automobiles. Now let's continue in this hypothetical scenario...say there's a guy having a heart attack in an ambulance at the very tail end of this traffic jam. He's upwards of a mile behind these yahoos. They can't hear the sirens or see the lights, because they're busy righteously damning the evils of the internal combustion engine. I guess their protest is more important than Joe Six Pack's life...sorry Joe.  If you hate cars, ride a bike...I don't care. I respect and commend you for being so dedicated to your opinion that you will make that kind of sacrifice, which is something that today's society is sorely lacking. Just do me, and everyone who doesn't share your opinion a favor...express it in a reasonable fashion. Strike up a conversation with someone and debate it with them. That's what makes this country great. Just don't hold an entire city block hostage with your political views. There are other people in this world besides you...but as Dennis Miller says, "that's just my opinion, I could be wrong."  Personal news. I got a new digital camera. It's pretty nice,  urlLink  here's a picture of Chester taken with the new cam.

         "Eleven House Democrats, led by Texas Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, have sent an — "urgent" letter to the U.N., insisting that its Electoral Assistance Division — which has supervised elections in such countries as Afghanistan, Kosovo, Liberia and Jamaica — should send representatives to the U.S. in November, to oversee the presidential elections."  I'm sorry...what? Can I really believe what I am reading? Members of our own elected government petitioning to the U.N. to come in and supervise our elections to make sure that a Florida fiasco does not ensue in the upcoming presidential election. The real question is: how do these representatives sleep at night?  What authority does the United Nations have to supervise our elections? They did so well making sure that there were free and representative elections in Iraq. What authority does the United Nations have to tell us how to run our country when their sole purpose in this world is to chide fanatical regimes with a meaningless stream of resolutions that have no teeth? The fact is that you send the United Nations in to supervise elections in THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES...not nations such as the United States.  These representatives are traitors to the people who elected them. They even acknowledged that when they filed this request...weren't they elected via the same system that produced the Florida fiasco? Aren't they in effect proclaiming their own lack of legitimacy by saying that the elections that gave them their own jobs are flawed? Good luck being re-elected, people. The United States has the best system of elections in the world, we don't need the U.N. to tell us what to do.

      July 4th is a holiday that is meant to celebrate our independence from the regime of Kind George III. While things between America and Britain certainly took a turn for the better, I unfortunately can't say the same about our appreciation for the freedoms that we enjoy.  The Minnesota Twins, as a part of their second annual "Armed Forces Appreciation Day," chose to give 5000 G.I. Joe dolls away to kids who attended today's game versus the Diamondbacks. Unfortunately, no deed goes unpunished, and soon the protestors came out of the woodwork to cry foul about the "glorification of war."     As you can see above, the Duke doll does not even carry a gun. The only thing he is armed with is a play grenade. Come to think of it, why aren't there people protesting that some kid could choke on the grenade??? I dunno.  War is terrible. This planet would be an absolute paradise if there were no wars. The cold reality is that there are always going to be governments, fanatical leaders, and genocidal maniacs who will require a use of force to reign in. It's terrible, but that's the way it has been throughout history.  I'm an American, you're probably an American (who knows where you are reading this blog from), and as Americans, we have the right to express our opinions without fear of persecution from the government. The same couldn't be said for our forefathers who lived in the reality that if they were to speak out about King George III, they could be hanged. You certainly have the right to be upset that the Twins are handing out a G.I. Joe doll, and as an American you also have another right: You have the right to not go to the game.   If the doll offends you so much, then either voice your opposition by not going to the game, or go to the game and do not allow your child to accept the doll...because god forbid your child make up their own mind about whether to support the members of the armed forces. The choice is yours, just as the choice is mine. I've got a deal for the people who are unhappy with the Twins: do NOT try to make the choice for me, and I won't try to make the choice for you.  I am thankful that the Twins had the cojones to stand their ground and go ahead with the promotion. It doesn't glorify war, it glorifies the members of our five armed services who lay their lives on the line every day to protect the freedoms that we hold dear. God Bless the Minnesota Twins, and God Bless America.

      I've been on the run so much this weekend, I've had so little time to update my fledgling blog.  Happy 4th of July everyone, here's what I did this weekend. Friday after work, Phil and I shot up 95 to cheesesteak central (no, not 125 courtyard) to catch a game between the Orioles and the Phillies. I'd been looking forward to this series since Philly has a brand spankin' new ballpark. The park is really very nice, although nothing compares to Oriole Park.   When we decided to head up to Philly, we never thought that we would have been witness to  urlLink The longest game in Oriole history!  Luckily after the 6:15 marathon that went from 7:05 until 1:20 in the morning, the Orioles made off with only win in the series.  After about 4 hours of sleep, Chester decided to wake me up early to feed him...there are no weekends for him. That afternoon it was off to Nissan Pavillion to check out Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band. It was my seventh show, and I think it's right up there with the first time that I saw him as one of the best I have seen.  urlLink The setlist  was a great mix of classic hits and new stuff from the  urlLink new album.  He started out alone on the stage...just Jimmy and his guitar singing Changes in Latitudes Changes in Atitudes (yes...that's how it's spelled, don't correct me, just trust me.) The second song added his good friend Mac McAnally, and gradually they added the rest of the band during the third song. It was really a neat presentation. At the end of the show, the final encore was Tin Cup Chalice, one of my favorite songs, and they ended the way they started...just Jimmy and his guitar. Great bookends to a great setlist.  Sunday was pretty much a nasty day anyway, so I didn't mind having to work, which has given me time to update my blog. Hopefully I will be able to find a news story to comment on while I'm here until midnight. If not, there will be an update tomorrow night sometime. Happy 4th everyone, God Bless America.

      'Bill Cosby  went off on another tirade against the black community Thursday, telling a room full of activists that black children are running around not knowing how to read or write and "going nowhere." '  Despite his professed love for all things Jello, Bill Cosby has emerged as a major leader in the African-American community...at least he should be. Why is there a need for the Jesse Jacksons and other leaders who cry out that the black community is entitled to things? News flash: slavery was horrible, I wouldn't wish that on Saddam Hussein...well maybe on Hussein, but that doesn't change the fact that slavery has been abolished for almost 140 years!  Bill Cosby speaks the truth that the black community ought to listen to. I'm sure in some circles his name will be bandied about as an "Uncle Tom," or "out of touch," but his words ring true. " 'They think they're hip,' the entertainer said. 'They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere.'" I couldn't have said it better myself, but I'm white, and probably not allowed to.  Advancement in today's society comes from one thing: self-respect. You will not get ahead in today's society if you can't do certain things. These things include speaking the language, working, learning, and mostly wanting to better yourself. That's the problem with programs like affirmative action and reparations, should they come about. Affirmative action does more to harm the black community than their leaders would like to admit.   The problem with affirmative action is that it sets a permenant "victim class." What you're saying is that you aren't good enough to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and advance yourself in this society. The only way that you have the ability to advance is through help from other people.   I am a Christian, and I am a big believer in the Christian tennant of "love thy neighbor." It doesn't come down to that. There's a difference between loving thy neighbor and giving them a handout. What's the expression, "give a man a fish and he eats tonight, but teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime." That short proverb shows what is truly hindering the black community. I don't blame them, it's basic human nature. If someone can bust their ass all day, come home smelling to the heavens of the foulest stench and have 50 bucks to show for it, and his neighbor gets a government check in the mail for 50 bucks, it doesn't take a slide rule to figure it out.   Another thing I found interesting.  urlLink This is another wonderful move in the name of racial harmony.  Can someone explain to me how racial harmony can be encouraged by fitting a bunch of white people with slave's yokes and parading them through downtown Annapolis? Sometimes activists do more to harm their cause than help it. I'd compare this to a diabetes advocate handing Krispy Kremes out in front of a hospital...it doesn't make much sense. Sure, the way that I feel isn't politically correct, it isn't popular, and it isn't "sexy," but it's true...at least I think so, and it's my blog.

      Michael Vick says that he won't cut his hair until the Falcons win a Superbowl. I wish him luck with his quest, but I think at some point he's going to have to come back to earth.    I don't think that Riddell makes helmets big enough to fit all of the hair that he'll surely be sporting. At some point, he'll just have to paint a falcon on the side of his hair, it'll give enough protection. I don't think the Falcons are close to winning a Superbowl. Sure, Vick is a great athlete, but you saw what the rest of the team is capable of when he wasn't around last season. Football is a team sport, and it takes more than just one player to win a championship. But seriously...good luck with that man.  Other great, GREAT news.   urlLink    Comedy Central has re-upped with Dave Chappelle for a third season of Chappelle's Show. Can't wait for this. This new deal will make Chappelle their signature star. I think he's worth every penny, the show is so well-written, and timely. He has the 18-34 male demographic cornered on cable, so why not give him a new deal. He's also inked to star in a biopic of Rick James. That can't be bad...unless the title is  I'm Rick James, Bitch.

      Terp football kicks off in 32 days with a little dose of payback for the Northern Illinois Huskies. I'll be there, will you?       This year's team is gonna be different, without Scotty slinging the ball around the field, but it's going to be exciting. The receivers are going to be good, and so is the defense. The only question marks are going to be the defensive backfield and the quarterbacks. The players I am looking forward to seeing, in no particular order:     Vernon Davis - the 28 yard reception in the Gator Bowl says it all.  Keon Lattimore - Fellow Mt. St. Joe grad, and Ray-Ray's little brother. He's going to be a difference maker.  Sammy Maldonado - Tough break when we lost him to injury last season, he's a bruiser.  Joel Statham - He looks like he's the heir-aparrent to the throne at Quarterback University, he can run the option, and I think with a little bit of experience, he can be a reliable signal caller.  Steve Suter - If you know Maryland Footbal...no further clarification is needed.    The key games this year will be: F$U at home (hopefully we can get over that hump), @Klempsun, @VaTech (I'll be there for that one), @UVA...you wouldn't catch me in that hell hole if you were paying me, and @WVU. I left NC State off because I think they will have a down year, and Chuck Amato has never beaten the Fridge...of course most of the coaches in the ACC can say that too.   Can't wait for it. Hopefully there will be a news item that catches my fancy so I can put something relevant up here.
