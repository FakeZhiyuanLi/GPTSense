        urlLink    Beth got a new kitty yesterday. His name is Blackjack. He's hyperactive, has no respect for authority and meows constantly for no apparent reason. He bit my finger and made it bleed. The other cat hates him. I took this picture with Beth's palm pilot,  hence the poor quality.

      Today is the last day of my 4th of July vacation. Then it's back to school for one day, then I'm off again Thursday, then school Friday, off for the weekend, school for three days then off again for six days. I don't know why they schedule two big breaks so close to eachother, but that's YTI for you. I had a pretty decent 4th. Each year both sides of my family have a picnic. They're usually on separate days, but this year they were both on the same day. First we went to my second cousin Jim's house for what is traditionally known as the "Shinndig" (I am descended from the Shinn family). This is attended mostly by people who I either don't know or only see once a year at this event. Afterwards, Beth and I went canoeing at Camp Blue Diamond. I hadn't been to Blue Diamond in years, but my parents used to send me there for church camp when I was a kid so it conjured up a lot of memories of not wanting to be there. It's a lot more enjoyable when I can do my own thing instead of being forced to do this or that and sing a bunch of stupid songs. We paddled around the lake for a while, enjoying the serenity of nature....or something. Then it was off to my aunt Wanda's house for picnic #2 where we ate food and watched my uncle and cousin and a couple of kids from accross the road set off fireworks in the rain. Then we headed to my grandmother's house for a little while before going back to my parents'. Overall, it was a good day. Good times were had by all and Beth got to see some wildlife she's never seen before, like dragonflies and a vulture (or was it a buzzard? I don't know the difference). I don't know how you can live for 26 years and never see a dragonfly, but that's Beth. Well, that's it for now. Maybe I'll update this thing again sometime.
