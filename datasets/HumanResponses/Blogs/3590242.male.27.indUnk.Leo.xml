      The following is an email sent by one J. Fiendish aka Cliff Dawg an East Indian graduate student in Southern California, to my younger brother Jonathan, currently stationed in Ukraine. Some references may be clouded in insider-ness, but the others will translate for those with a decent sense of humor...you've got to love absurdity...for more of this individual, visit www.cliffdawg.com  Jay Dub Gee EM! I finished my quarter today and thought I'd unwind by verbally vomiting every detail from the last 8 weeks into electronic mail(honestly I promised myself I would not write until the giants got over .500-- for a second it looked like i'd have to wait until next april-they one or two over now). This quarter has been soooo fucken tough. I know what you're thinking- tough eh?  Like getting shipped away from civilization/friends and family, being forcefed a new language and thrown into a new job with no infrastructure tough? Naw it's more like my spinny rims ain't as spinny as they used to be tough (like they still spinny- mad spinny- but not like back in the day). Whatever dawg that shit's TOUGH. SPINNY RIMS? THAT'S HOW I DO! I was so psyched when the quarter ended. My teacher in Digital Signal Processing is this southern engineer dude whose so fucken lame (calling my teachers lame- it's like we're back in eighth grade). Anyways I wanted  to go back to colorado before summer session started and so I asked him when the class was gonna end and he was like final presentations will be on the seventh and the ninth. Whatever- I got my ticket for the ninth. The TA was like- you can do your presentation first so you then you can catch a plane and this Southern Chicken Fucker is all "No everyone must see every presentation." Then the motherfucker changed it to all the presentations on the seventh. Fucker cost me a day. Then the motherfucker comes into class today (the seventh) and is like "why is the campus empty" and people are like "it's finals week" and he's all "Oh i meant to schedule presentations the last week of class-- it's not fair to make ya'll stay until after finals." MOTHERFUCKER COST ME A WEEK. I know what you're thinking and the answer is yeah- if i was white i'd be on a fucken plane rightnow. If I was fucken Powder or some shit- I'd be on a plane, going home, all the while feeling a dying deer's pain. That southern fuck was doing the college profesor equivalent of "I meant to give you 40 acres and a mule but I decided to whip your hide bloody instead." They did that shit to OJ they did that shit to Kobe and now they doin that shit to me. He's taking his grandson to disney land tomorrow-- Maybe they can ride down Aneheim on my back. Oh god Jon this race relations rant reminded me of the funniest fucken quote I've ever seen (I'm a google that shit right now). Ok I'm gonna title the quotes and  then show you the quotes and then put the name of the speaker down far enough down so you won't be able to see it (if you do see it whatever) and i want you to guess who it is. """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" . . .to the NAACP - Low income Blacks not holding up their end of the bargain. . . and now we've got these knuckleheads walking around," he declared. "The lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal. These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids - $500 sneakers for what? And won't spend $200 for 'Hooked on Phonics.'   "I can't even talk the way these people talk: 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is'... You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth!"   Turning to criminal justice, he said, "These are not political  criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake and then we run out and we are outraged, saying, 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?"    Scroll down to see speaker.                   """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   The Speaker- Bill Cosby. Yeah. That's right Bill Cosby. Oh my fucking god. Wow fucking wow. When did Cliff Huckstable become Uncle Tom? Jesus. My initial reaction was "WHY YOU AIN'T RESPECTIN US NIZZA! SHIT MO'FUCKA!" Is it just me or is it time for ghost dad to shut the fuck up. Has Cosby even been to  the ghetto-- Shit ain't right. Every black child is addicted to pound cake. Shit,in the ghetto Pound Cake's a reality- fuck, it's a way of life. Poor Single Black mother on welfare birthin cake babies-- we've all heard the story. Shit Cos- don't let David Duke ghost write your speech.   In my other class that I completed earlier was advanced linear algebra taught by Stephan Garcia. No that was not a typo- he's a Latino male. Dude not JUST a Latino male though. An EDUCATED LATINO MALE. It was like my class was being taught by the endangered white siberian tiger. In office hours I was always like "enough talk about math-- is there anyone in your life? You gotta get on that dawg- spread your seed so the species can grow!" I guess for the species to grow he'd have to find an educated Latina female-- I guess we could  lock them up in a room together but they may not mate in captivity. . .In all honesty He was am amazing teacher. It was funny cause he was telling the white kids what to do and I was like Awww hell yeah! You know some fucken white boy struggled with the homework one day and then ran to the border to take out his frustrations on the drive through lady. And you know the drive through lady didn't understand ANY of it and still managed to screw up his order. Ahhh such is life.    Oh get this, three or four weeks ago I had a run in with the reoccuring Desi Ajeshwar ("black people are causing a ruckus in the park" Ajeshwar). He saw two girls dancing and informed me when two girls are dancing you wedge yourself inbetween them. AJ got the game on lock. I heard about your own Indian friend's drama from Scott. Poor guy goes half way around the world, sacrifices two years of his life and gets mistreated racially and gets jacked?! Fucken sucks. Meanwhile AJ goes halfway around the world, drops some racial shit of his own to police, and some sleazy shit to me. For every cool Indian there's an AJ fucking it up for us all. Fuck Aj. That poundcake eatin motherfucker. Man fuck that shit.     I'mma hit you with all the crazy sports happenings. GIANTS went on a ten game win streak! And they did so with bad pitching! Like every other game was an extra inning affair or where they blew a lead but would come back and win. Then after the winstreak was done they took three of four from the Rockies on the road (they scored like massive amounts of runs in each win-- I think like high 30's runs scored for the four game series). The west is soooo weak this year that if we can start winning with our offense we can make the playoffs (but probably not get to far). Oh yeah and Ken Griffey is suddenly tearing it up again. Yeah WTF. Randy Johnson pitched a perfect game. Jamal Lewis (runningback for the baltimore ravens) is accused of conspiracy to sell coke. I wonder what Bill Cosby has to say about this. Lakers lost game one of the NBA finals to the pistons. It was crazy-- the pistons somehow controlled the game, tempo, everything. Is kind of meaningless against the Lakers though. Hopefully Detroit keeps it up. I heard after the game a disgusted Shaq left the stadium, entered his garage and pulled on the garage door's red chord as hard as he could. Ronald Regan died (don't ask me why this is in the sports section). A  few weeks ago baseknock (Neifi Perez) had a walkoff hit. Gotta love it when baseknock lives up to his ill begotten name. Today or yesterday in a press conference, Bill Parcells referred to his trick plays that the Dallas Cowboys are gonna dream up  this season as "Jap plays." Needless to say there was a shitstorm. Whatever, it's about time orientals were included in football (for something other than that yellow first down line which I'm sure they had a hand in. Technical  WIZARDS.) Parcells should hire Amy Tan- the Joy Luck Club was the ultimate Jap Play. . .            back to life. My mom had an ovarian syst that was EXTREMELY painful --she said possibly worse than birth pains-- she had one two years ago so now when it came back she was in massive amounts of pain again and decided to get a hysterectomy(I think they took out her ovaries among other piping). She's doing  well after the surgery and just chillin at home. I'll see how she is when I go back day after tomorrow.   Anand tried to collect rent from a sassy single white 20 something male who adopted a sassy black back-talking kid. The results were hilarious/heartwarming. Anand's doing well- I'm a see that kid when i go back too (Anand not the black kid. . .look to be honest Jon the black kid doesn'texist- I made him up). He goes hiking and he plays softball in a league(which sounds like so much fun I might have to hit one up this summer).   My Dad's just Chillin'. He stayed in the hospital with mom while she had the operation (translation: he stood idly by while my birthplace was desecrated). I'll be able to give you more descriptions of my fam when I get home.    I talked to Scott the other day- he was like "I'm getting a condo." I was like DAYYMN PLAYA. What if Anand's his landlord? he'd have to find him every first of the month. The A's weren't doing so hot but we still talked ball. I'm trying to get him to come down to SB this summer.    Seeing you on IM was sooo much fun. It honestly made my week. I think when I'm in Colorado I'm gonna have to invest in one of those cards and then give you a call (maybe when i come back to SB). If not though I will definitley start sending emails with a greater frequency now that it's summer and the quarter from hell is over (if anything just rambling away). I know you're doing Awesome and amazing work, I love the pics and the emails. Hey Jon-- I have scrubs season 2 on cd and I can totally send it to you if you'd like. Either way I'll send you a conglomeration of random episodes and crap I have on my computer. IF YOU NEED/WANT ANYTHING DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK ME (I can  get any episodes you want or a sweater or music or anything). You'll be happy to know that I'm doing copious amounts of research into freezdrying a chalupa. Until that can be achieved I'm honoring your memory by going to T Bell every week (alright I'd go to T Bell anyways but these days I think of you when I go- I get the number six (two chalupas and a taco) and I drop the taco on the ground and be like "For my nGro Jon, peace my brother" and the guy behind the counter screams something like "MANOS DIABLOS!" and then fishes out a mop from his closet). By the way- futurama has suddenly gotten an ENOURMOUS cult following. I still don't understand it but it seems like everyone out here is like "Futurama is the tightest fucking show ever." I don't fucking believe it; dawg, according to the populous, you were right and you were ahead of  your time. I guess Futurama is my clerks the cartoon series. I do however agree that the slurm episode is the most hilarious thing ever. they bringin family guy back next year- hopefully it'll be tight.    Alright Dawg- keep it real and stay away from drugz and akahal. And I'll hit you back Sooner this time FOR SURE. It's a promise (albeit from a Injun)    Your proud friend, J. Fiendish   GRODY!

      Welcome to my blog. My name is Scott and I am a 27 year old resident of Oakland, CA. I enjoy drinking recreationally (beer, hard alcohol, tea, coffee and espresso), smoking (Cigars, alas cigarettes are no longer in the picture), Oakland pro-sports (Athletics and Raiders), music (pre-1980 Country and Western, pre-1990 Rock and Roll, early 90's East Bay punk rock), reading/writing fiction, philosophy (Hume is my basis)procrastinating, complaining and pontificating. As such, I decided to throw up a blog where I can ruminate about those first six interests and indulge in the final three. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I tend to suffer from mild manic-depression and major social anxiety giving my outlook a rather pessimistic, misanthropic tint. Anyhow, if for some bizarre reason you are receiving this transmission, enjoy and jump in.  --scott
