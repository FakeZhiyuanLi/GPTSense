      I picked up a book I borrowed from a friend around the Yom Kippur War. There is no doubt the hero of YKW is Ariel Sharon. However, one face stood out in the midst of all the pictures, a bald headed man wearing an eye patch. He is the legendary Isreali General, Moshe Dayan.   Moshe Dayan lost his left eye while in the British Army fighting in Lebannon. Since then, he wore what was to be his trademark, black eye patch. A tough and fiercely competitive and rugged nut to crack, he rose to become IDF's Chief of Defense Force. In 1956, He led the Israel's suez Campaign, defeating the joined forces of Egypt, Syria and Jordan and invading the Sinai Pennisular.   Dayan is known to be the man who took the initiatives. He knew that the Arabs waged terrorism against them to buy time to build up their own forces. He wanted to force them into open battles and thus crippling the Arab forces. He regularly made raids into Gaza and inflicting huge casualities on the Arabs.   After he left the military, he served in the political arena of Israel. He served as Minister of Defense during the Six Days War. When the Syrians were shelling Israeli villages in Upper Galilee, Dayan was the one who made the decision to launch a full-scale attack against the Syrians. It was also Dayan who ended the fighting by arranging a cease-fire with Syria through Chief of Staff of the UN Observer Corps, General Odd Bull.   "Rocking the boat is his favourite tactic, not to overturn it, but to sway it sufficiently for the helmsman to lose his grip or for some of its unwanted passengers to fall overboard."

      EURO 2004 will go down as the one that we saw the shattering of "myths" in European football scene. Truth had prevailed and come forth.   Myth #1 : Spain Spain was also considered a force to be reckoned with but Euro 2004 showed it is just another participating country. Such was the sorry state of Spanish football that they can't make it past the first round.  Myth #2 : England What do Erikson and loud hailers have in common? They amplify. England is just an average team with a few celebrity footballers. The only reason why England have such a huge following worldwide was because Britain or England colonised almost half of the known world during the glorious days of the Great Britain Empire. Imperialism and colonial brainwash. I'm sorry for all who still live in 1966, time to move on. It's 2004.  Myth #3 : Germany Let's face the fact. The "Golden Era" of German football had passed by. It's time for some restructuring and reconstruction. Will we see a "Third Reich" ?  Myth #4 : France Who says they are invincible? Talents alone does not subsitute hardwork and teamwork. Like I had always said, they peaked too fast and too soon.   Myth #5 : Italy I hate to say this but I have to say it. If Italy continue the way it is, it is going to be another England. loudmouth. What's lacking is a real quality striker and a coach who's not afraid to bench some reputable stars.   Myth #6 : Czech Who says you can't do it with old men? Czech does it. They made it to the semis. They may have a few old men in the team but the cohesion and teamwork tells.   Myth #7 : Greece How appropriate that Greece chose EURO 2004 to make a statement in the football arena. 2004 is the year they are hosting the Olympics Games. Once again, they shown underdogs do WIN! All the best, Greece!

      I'm sure you feel very safe and secure the whole of last week, knowing that you had able-bodied young men protecting you. That's right, I was doing my reservist last week. It is a once a year affair. To the men, it's just another holiday but to the officers (like myself), it's another administrative headache. Thank God it's over!  To Warriors of 452 SAR, SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!

      The more I see Cassano play, the more impressed I'm with him. He is a very good player. Cassano got the skills to beat defenders, the vision to craft goals, the ability to score goals and he is in the right place at the right time.   I reckon him to be the "Baggio" of the future Italian team! And I'm happy he combined well with Del Piero and Vieri. All the way, Azzuris!

      It was a long series of posts by me. 7 parts. In the fullness of time! Well, God touched me and changed me even before I became a Christian. For my case, there's nothing spectacular about my salvation experience. It's about discovering myself through God. God's love is manifested through the people He brought into my life.   Character change is not instant but a constant process. However, the decision to change is instant! Once you made it, stick by it, you will love it!  Hope you enjoyed reading it!

      Okay, I had paid my tribute to the man who was crucial to my early Christian walk. Let me back track and go back to how I know Christ.   Hymns  One day in Sec 2, I was practising some hymns for BB singspiration because I was supposed to lead that very week. Not a Christian, it was just some singing to me. But as I practised singing, that familiar peaceful feeling comes into my heart. By now, I had some basic knowledge of Christ and Christianity. I took out my BB handbook and I prayed the sinners' prayer by myself. I also do not know why I did it but I just know that I got to do it. I felt that if I don't do it, I would probably never have a chance to! After I prayed the sinners' prayer, I called Roger. It was 30th May 1993.    School of Hard Knocks  After I became a Christian, it was a very rocky experience. I was still Spiritually immature and being the hotheaded teenager I was then, got into troubles and also offended many people. To cut the whole story short, i backslided after i left secondary school. But Mun Yee invited me to City Harvest Church when I was in Poly year 2.   I stood her up a couple of times. Alison would tell me later that she was thinking who is this Chong Keng? So up and lofty that come to a church also so difficult. Finally, I went to the Festival of Praise on invitation by Mun Yee.   Rev Peter Youngren  That night, Rev Peter Youngren was preaching. To be absolutely honest, I do not remember or understand anything he said that night. I only knew that he kept saying "The Word of God cannot be bound!" When he gave the altar call, I just knew I got to respond.  The following week, I went with Mun Yee to City Harvest and attended my first service with CHC. That familiar peace made its way into my heart that very service and I made one decision that I had not regretted yet!   I made CHC my Church.

      My parents and eldest sister decided that it would be good for me to attend a good secondary school. In my eldest sister's opinion, a Christian school would be good because they are strict. This is how I ended up in St. Hilda's though my results could easily get me into Victoria which was my dream school then.    New Life  Only 2 students from my school went to St. Hilda's. I was one of them. With a new environment where nobody knows me, I started life anew. By now, I was very much in control of my emotions but still remain very much reserved. My new friends did not know my past. To them, I am a nice guy and a good-tempered Boy. I also joined the Boys' Brigade because that's the most prestigious uniformed group in the school.    Roger  In the BB, I learnt about God and Jesus. And I got to know Roger. Now, Roger is a pastor. He played a big part in my knowing God. He give Bible Studies to me. And by just being with him, I sense something different but i dare not ask him what was it. After all, he is my officer. I dare not be too close to him. He was there for me during some of my family's most difficult times. And he was there for me during my most "down" times in Sec 3. Together with Longfa and Joeson, he showed me what brotherly love is.

      That moment marked just the beginning of a journey. A journey to know God. I did not became a Christian that day nor was I filled with the Holy Spirit. That day, the path was set for me to know that God is real.    Judgement  My parents came to school the next day. I did not know what the Principal and Vice Principal told them but I know the consequence of my actions. I was publicly caned in school and suspend for a few days. Strange enough, I did not react or rebel against the discplinary actions as usual. My form teacher was shocked and I was equally dumbfounded at myself too! However, I was happy deep inside. Finally, the demon inside of me is starting to being controlled.    Cold Turkey  I did not became a goody two shoes overnight but I made a consious efforts, with the help of my friends, to curb my anger problem. Hong weili used to tell me, after that incident, whenever I got angry, "you want to be suspended again?" Sometimes, I feel just like an addict having cold turkey whenever I got angry and cannot react to it. Everytime, I managed to control my anger, the same peaceful feeling that afternoon in the park came back to me. I do not know why but it made me stronger and I began to desire for more of it.

      On the way home, I cried. With tears in my eyes, I walked home as usual. This time I would take a different path back home. I went through a park and a lot of thoughts filled my mind. Would my 2 volume disclinary records be enough to keep me until after PSLE? I do not want to be a failure in life. To me, a failure is someone who did not get a good education.    Explusion?  I was in the office and the Vice Principal seemed bent on expelling me from the school and it is just 2 months before the PSLE. With my kind of disclinary records, no school would take me in.  I was at a very big loss and I did not know what to do. All I knew was that my Principal trusted me to get my parents to school and I must repay him for that. All I knew was that after that "heroic" deed, fear crept in from all sides. It was not a good feeling.    Is there a God?  Suddenly, a thought came to my mind. The Christians always talked of a God. Is there really a God? With tears in my eyes, I looked to the sky and quietly said this, "God! If you're real, help me." I remember vividly this moment for something happened to me right after that. There was an impecable sense of peace in me. All the rage in me disappeared in the thin air all of a sudden. I do not know what this meant then but years later, I came to realised this is my first encounter with God.

      It was a cool afternoon and our Vice Principal is supposed to be teaching us remedial lessons. As any good director would have it, this is the best chance for a drama to happen. That's right! Mr Hyde took over me....   Rebellion  I still remember that I fought with Wenliang in class that afternoon but I can't remember the reason or the cause of it. I would consider myself to be insane by this time. An insane man needs no reason to blow up at people. I would not go into the details...  Hearing the commotion, the Vice Principal came in the classroom and broke up the fight. I was furious and attempted to hit her and a long string of "Hokkien" vulgar expletives was released from my arsenal of angry words! Moments later, I was called to her office and the Principal was there too. I could still remember the Principal saying he wants to see my parents.   "I'm not going to call them but I trust you to tell them about this and come here tomorrow."  These are his exact words to me. I remembered very clearly because it was one of those moments in my life that I would never forget!

      As I grew older, I did not learn how to control my emotions. Or I could really have a serious psychological condition that caused me to get into fights with people and very emotionally stirred up easily. During my primary school days, my parents are regular visitors to the Principal's office with me an almost permanent fixture in the discipline master's appointment list every week.    Addicted  At first, the visits to school by my parents as requested by school Principal are few and sparse in between. Gradually, it became a monthly affair and soon it is a weekly affair when I was in Primary 6. I was addicted to outrage and fighting and losing myself. If you ask me how I felt then, I seriously do not know. I do not recall anything much except that I fought a lot of my good friends and probably I also destroyed a lot of great friendships with people in the process.   I became even more aloft and withdrawn to myself. Not wanting to talk to people, I often buried myself in the books. Although I was in the top class and among the top students, my life was going down the drain because of my inability to control my outrage.

      As Requested by a good friend of mine, Yang Yi (Shuai Ge), I'm posting something personal about me.   Background  Born 2nd Jan 1979 in a private clinic, I was raised in a "kampong" in my first 3 years although I stayed over the weekends until the house was demolish in 1985+. My only collection then was taking my first steps and then dive straight down a slope near my Grandpa's little hut. (My Grandpa do not stay in the same house as us then. He got his own hut behind our house.) I got 3 elder sisters and 1 elder brother and the nearest in age to me is 3 years old. Ever since I'm young, I grew up and play with people older than me. This explains why I clicked better with older people. An intensely private person when it comes to feeling, I never like to openly discuss how I felt with people and I'm never good at words. It could be due to the fact that I learnt to speak and actually speak only when I was 6.    Growing Up  I do not recall much of my childhood but 3 distinct incidents stood out to me. The first and the earliest is mentioned above. The second is busting my chin while practising my "xiang long shi ba zhang". The third is slicing my finger with a knife while trying to cut an apple for my sister. I do not know why or how but I had always felt a very intense disdain for Christians since young. It just flows out of me. In fact, it causes bitterness and resentment to biuld up in me. In time to come, I became a walking time bomb......

      Sometimes, I wonder what makes Hitler the man he was. And will I turn into someone like him? Hitler and me are two man quite similiar and alike in many ways but the difference between us lies in a decision.   How small can a decision be but how great an impact it will have eventually. The difference between Hitler and me is that I chose Jesus and he did not. I chose to be a follower of Christ, releasing forgiveness to people around me and he did not.   That bitterness welled up in Hitler would eventually led to him being insonmia and eventually caused him to lose the war and everything he have, including his mind and his right to lead. Sad story but powerful lesson.  "What you decide on today will determine what you become tomorrow."   This is my paraphrase of one of my all time favourite movie quotes. It is taken from Gladiator, spoken by Maximus when he was still the General of the Army of the North before he led his calvary into battle... "What you do in life echo in eternity"  As for me, i decide not to let the Sun set on my anger. What about you?

      Although my favourites team drew but I'm still proud of them. They did not lose, like some team that boasts of a lot of "World Class" players called England.   Buffon is the best! Azzuris, all the way! We may draw now but it's known fact we are slow starters to tournaments!

      There is much rejoicing in Singapore today over the reduction in National Service period for all males. Everyone is now required to serve a maximum of mandatory 2 years of military service. Indeed, it's a joy to many! Parents are relieved! Half a year less of fearing that at the next doorbell, they will see an Officer standing at their doorsteps with a letter in hand and the headdress in the other.  Personally, I do not think it calls for much rejoicing. It just reflect the sad state and disillusion our country have of National Service as a whole. In what could be interpreted as a move to gain more votes in upcoming elections, the ruling PAP once again won over the hearts of anxious parents, what more after all the recent "training accidents". A brillant move in my opinion! It serves to let the nation knows that they are still being cared for and it also serves to correct a little bit of that disillusion people have about National Service, that hostility feeling. I must appluade our Government for this! A brillant political move indeed.  Coming back to my point, National Service is all about protecting your country, your loved ones. Since ages of old, the only reason man volunteerily go to war is because they are seeking survival for themselves, their love ones and their purposes. This is the most ancient form of National Service. And I'm sad at the state and the hostility people viewed National Service as waste of time, hindering them to progress in life. These people are whom I called the "traitors"  of our values! For without a strong unified Army, there will be no Singapore. When there's no Singapore, there will be no home and thus, no you and me.   National Service should be view with respect and dignity. For if it's treated with disdain, we will quickly erroded to be a lawless society, just like some neighboring countries I know.   What joy and previlege it is to lay down your life for your love ones, your country!   Vive La Singapore!

      To all you music lovers out there,  Maksim is really good! If you really love music, you should listen to his music. I was at HMV just now, it just blew me off! He worked magic on his piano. As you listen to his music, it's like taking a journey. I strongly recommend his music to anyone who loves some good music.

      Today I tried the Starhub iView. It's cool and nice. Imagine watching TV channels on your computer. It reminds me of a movie i watched years ago by Andy Lau. VOD (Video on Demand) is his biz. I just hope that with the digital services, TV will take on a new dimension. Personally, I'm very tempted to go for it but well, the choices available doe snot appeal to me. If they have a All-Day 24hrs channel showing nothing but Jolin's songs and videos, I will definitely go for it!  As of now, it will just stay as a thought...

      Donald Rumsfeld died and went to heaven. As he stood in front of St.Peter at the Pearly Gates, he saw a huge  wall of clocks behind him.  He asked, "What are all those  clocks?" St. Peter answered, "Those are Lie-Clocks. Everyone  on Earth has a Lie-Clock. Every time you lie the hands on your  clock will move."  "Oh," said Rumsfeld, "Whose clock is  that?"  "That's Mother  Teresa's. The hands have never moved, indicating that she never told a  lie."  "Incredible," said Rumsfeld. "And whose clock is  that one?"  St. Peter responded, "That's Abraham Lincoln's  clock. The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abe  told only two lies in his entire life."  Where's  Bush's clock?" asked Rumsfeld.  "Bush's clock is in Jesus'  office. He's using it as a ceiling fan."

      Today I write a lot, so bear with me.  Terrorism is nothing but just an act of cowardice. It is the lowest form of armed conflict. I do not personally considered it to be "Warfare". Warfare, according to Clausewitz, is the act of imposing your will on another person by act of force. Terrorism does not fall in that category. Terrorism is putting fear in the hearts of people and using that fear to drive people towards the direction you want to go. Warfare is fought on the same level but not terrorism. You can say terrorism is outright rebellion against authority. Anyone from a lower level fighting against a higher level is leading a rebellion. A rebellion is a breech of LOYALTY, that key factor to which our society and human civiliazations are built upon. Without loyalty, there would be no family. Without family, there would be no Country.   Terrorism is therefore not imposing your will on somebody but it is putting fear into people. Where fear abounds, creativity is strifled. When creativity is strifled, society is on the decline! One fine example is to look at countries where terrorists are allowed to operate legally! I do not wish to bring out examples but you can see for yourself. Conversely speaking, in countries where terrorism is battled vigorously, creativity thrived! Society grows and the country advances! Again, you can see the examples for yourself.   I sincerely believe that in the last days, the greatest battle we are going to fight is not on the battle grounds but in the hearts of men. For in the last days, we are fighting to bring out the "Trust" and "FAITH" in a man's heart, the surest weapon against "FEAR" and Terrorism. What we need are not men and women who have no fear in their hearts. We need men and women who desipte of the fears in their hearts, choose TRUST and FAITH in the leadership appointed over them and in God.   Will we thrive over this new evil called terrorism or be trampled underneath by it? Only you can decide. I pray and hope that you follow your heart and not your fears.   (You may write to me and discuss this issue in depth with me if you want to. I'm open to it but my stand will always be the same. Terrorism, the New Evil)

      Every since I heard the first song sang by her, I was captivated by this great and beautiful singer! She got a good voice, looks great. Most importantly, the big round eyes and the pixie like face and she's slim. (Sorry folks! That's right. I prefer the slim and skinny to the plumb and chubby and the "oversized", as a life partner. ) She may have all the physical qualities I'm looking for but well, reality bites! hahaha! If I would find someone who look in the mould of Jolin but is a strong professing Christian with same beliefs as me, I don't mind. As I always said, I believe in a God who is GOOD so I choose both looks and character. Sad to say, such an one had not come along.   In the meantime, let me just continue to be "captivated" by JOLIN TSAI.

      Imagine trying the whole afternoon and night to understand and figure out some logic that seems so weird and funny and still do not get it? This happens to me today!  It was quite "blues". Gloomy and frustrating. The first thing I went home was sleep because I was just plain tired. Probably because last night had a late phone session with a good friend of mine. Suddenly I was jolted out of my sleep by the thought ,"I had not checked my mail". Here am I minutes later!

      Yesterday, the world had lost one of the most important contributor to how history is written after WWII, the late former American President, Ronald Reagan. We mourned the death of the man who ended the Cold War. We mourned the death of the man who said "Mr Gobachev, tear down this wall!" I will never forget that statement he made at the Berlin Wall. 8 months later, Berlin Wall came tumbling down.   President Reagan, as I like to refer to him as, was one of the inspiration in Modern America. Entrusted with helping American rediscovering itself after the Korea War, Vietnam War, Gas Shortage Crisis and Watergate Scandal, he lived out the Aermican Spirit and he helped millions of Amercian live out theirs!  Here is my tribute to this MAN whom we will miss, especially in the end days. A great communicator and a true blue AMERICAN HERO.

      Iceland was helpless as England put goals pass the goal line SIX times. It marked the biggest win for England after the 6-0 win over Lexumborg ages along. Was England that magnificent and that majestic throughout the match?   I thought the scoreline was rather flattering for England. To put things straight from my perspective, Iceland playing England is like Singapore playing Japan. Everyone knows what is the result going to show. The difference in class and standards between England and Iceland are evident from the starting lineup.   When I watch the match, I was rather impressed with how Scholes, Lampard and Rooney linked up with each other. Their understanding was good and could bring England to new heights. In the second half, I thought Butt and Hargreaves made the England team looked very good with their runs and passes and holding the ball in the middle of the park. I hate to say this but Michael Owen still look as lost as ever. He must have rubbed something off from Heskey after spending so many years with him at Liverpool.   England looks good with the way they are in the first half but they certainly have to play Butt or Hargreaves at starting if they want to have a chance of winning against France. I would love to see Rooney as the lone striker with Scholes playing the now familiar role just behind him and Lampard running late from the midfield. Butt could babysit the defence with Gerrard which leaves Becks to partner Lampard in the center. Midfield is where France is strongest but that is where they are most fragile.   I still feel that this England team lacks a bit of maturity in their play. They are inventive enough in their attack but when faced with opponents like France, they would struggle due to that lack of maturity.   How good is this England team is left to be seen but I'm sure of one thing. They won't get my cheers as I would be rooting for my favorite, AZZURIS!

      This is my first entry. I do not know why I'm doing this but it is a good way to keep track of things in my life.   I was very sick today. Can you believe that for most part of the day, I did not speak a single word due to the bad sore throat I had? It was so bad that I could see redness swelling on my throat. Not to mention that it causes a bad fever too. Now, I can certainly speak after dirnking some herbal drink which my mum brewed. Thank God for healing and MOTHERS!  Just added $5 of smses to my phone every month for the next 6 months. I had went to M1 website and redeemed my Foneperks rewards. I'm hoping of a chance to win the Nokia 6230.

         Kidnapping     It seemed like the latest fab in town is not stripes but hoods and ropes. Every day we heard of someone being kidnapped in Iraq. I wished I had a shop in Iraq now selling hoods, ropes and videotapes.     &nbsp;   People from all walks of life and various social positions and nationalities are being kidnapped. I wondered if all the kidnappers are trying to see who can "go around the world". Let's just pray that this "quest" will be for 80days!     &nbsp;   Why are they kidnapping people? What are their motives? To stop "invaders" from coming into their country? Who knows? No one knows. All I know from this is that it is an opportunity to make money. Imagine a "Premiun Package for Kidnappers" featuring unbreakable ropes or various lengths, padded nylon hoods with chin support, short length 15 minute video tapes and free professional video-editing. Let me throw in a "free vctim" of a nationality of your choice.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Well, all these kidnappers are here to stay as long as they want to because they knew Arroyo... ops... I mean SOMEONE... will always give in to their demands. Much as I detest their acts, there will be Arroyo... ops again... I mean ANOTHER ONE... who are scared by their acts. (Talk about women leading countries, the last tough one I knew was Margaret Thatcher. All who follows are just barbie dolls.)     &nbsp;    Bombings     This is another terrible trend that occurs in recent months. Again, I wished I'm in Iraq. This time, I will set up a Casket Company. Boy, I'm beginning to think I'm beginning to think like PM Goh. Take risk, go overseas, be innovative.     &nbsp;   I will offer funderal services to the dead, offer to clean up the scenes and sell coffin. Imagine how much I would have made in Bali or Madrid? these are the one-off bigtime income. There's also the regulars in Iraq, Israel and the Middle East. Seem like this is a good bunsiness.     &nbsp;   Again, as long as someone like OSAMA or Arafat is around, we will sing this new version of a Rhyme I learnt while young.    "Every day a bomb here, a bomb there, a bomb everywhere. Old Macdonald had a bomb..E Ya E Ya O!"     &nbsp;   (Incidentally, the Old Macdonald house in Singapore was bombed in the insurrgent in the 70s.)

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) -- NASA is about to embark on its hottest mission ever, to Mercury.  The Messenger spacecraft, to be launched next week, will be blasted by up to 700-degree heat as it orbits the tiny planet closest to the sun -- so close that it would be as though 11 suns were beating down on Earth. Remarkably, the only thing between the probe's room-temperature science instruments and the blistering sun and pizza-oven heat will be a handmade ceramic-cloth quilt just one-quarter of an inch thick.      "If it doesn't stay toward the sun, it will fry everything," said Neal Bachtell, mechanical technician and master quilter.  Bachtell used X-Acto blades to cut the 3M Nextel fabric and then -- relying on sewing tips from his mother -- used an industrial sewing machine to stitch the off-white pieces together into an 8-by-9-foot quilt, using Teflon-coated fiberglass thread. It was a nasty job; the itchy, ceramic-fiber cloth sheds and is bad to inhale.

      As I was reading the reports on the findings of 9/11 commission, I can't help but ponder "Why don't they come straight to the point?" The truth is: complacency set in. Nothing more, nothing less.  So much talk about the misinformed or misled information or oversight, it just meant one things: complacency. When we get caught in a routine, complacency will show up and knock on our doors. This is the morale of the story for 9/11.  This is also truth for our own spiritual lives as well as our service to God. Complacency will set in once routines are formed. This is why it is so important that we never lose sight of our focus and the passion.   I&nbsp;serve because I love God and love people!

      Have you ever wondered how the Ancient Egpytians managed to build the pyramids? Have you ever wondered how the Ancient Chinese managed to build the Great Wall? Have you ever wondered how World War II was won? &nbsp; If you have, you would have reached the same conclusion as me. Focused efforts. The entire nation was mobilized in the case of the pyramids and the Great Wall. The entire Allied nations were mobilized in the case of World War II. All efforts were directed at Normandy, making it successfully and the Allied forces able to launch an invasion from there.  &nbsp; Such is the power of focused efforts. And it just reminds me of the Early Church days when the people were in one accord praying in the upper room, the Holy Spirit fell on them. Again, we see a common focus here. When Paul goes on his missionary journeys, the Church stood behind him supporting him in whichever means possible. The result is most parts of Europe been reached. Once again, we have focused efforts here.  &nbsp; This power of focused efforts is seen much evident even in today's world. For a team who always make up the number of teams in any tournament they took part, Greece showed what focused efforts can do and transform a sub-average team into Champions. Sun focused a few years of her life in the Crossover project and it changed the face of music forever. It opened up China and all chinese speaking people all over the World for the Gospel!  &nbsp; A lot of people spend a lot of time and money on self-help books and seminars. They spend lots of money to walk over fire or listen to someone babbling something that they themselves had been taught in school.  &nbsp; Everyone of one knows that Work done = Force X Distance. More work is done if more force is applied over longer distance. Similiarly, this means that we will be more productive if we put in more resources and efforts (force) into what we are doing for a prolonged period (distance). In other words, we will achieve more if our efforts are focused!  &nbsp; If only people bother to think and read the Word and understand what Jesus says, they wold understand! This is why Jesus said "He who have ears let him hears". He's telling us to be focused in what we are DOING! "If you're supposed to be listening, you LISTEN! Don't do other things." That's the essence of Jesus' message when He said those Words.  &nbsp; &nbsp; (There's a reason why God made known to us the wonders of science.&nbsp;On the Word hungs all the laws of the prophets. On the Word, Jesus, the whole World is founded.&nbsp;Upon Jesus, God establish the laws of nature and science.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is why science can never &nbsp;go against God's Word. It will only complement. But unrenewed human minds can cause science to go against God's Word. ) &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I had been reading up on my new re-found love, Dinosaurs. Recently, I just got interested in them yet again. There's a pattern and trend that I had noticed which is rather amazing sounding to me.   At each ERA or AGE, all the Dinosaurs are plant eaters. In fact, most dinosaurs are plant eaters but as the time goes by, meat-eating Dinosaurs appeared. After some time, plant-eating dinosaurs became more prominent again. This is a marvelous example of how the ECO system is at work even in those times.   Here's my explanation for this trend I had noticed. All the dinosaurs are herbivorous or plant-eating. It is highly likely that they only feed on a particular type of plant. Soon these dinosaurs multiplied and filled the face of the Earth. As the smaller dinosaurs loses out to the bigger ones when it comes to feeding time, the smaller dinosaurs had to turn to elsewhere for food. They are no longer able to wrestle the bigger ones from the plants. They turned their attention to meat. As they are smaller in size, they hunt in packs and herds. This probably explains why most carnivorous or meat-eating dinosaurs are smaller in size.   As time goes by, the balance of the ECO system is restored. The plant they are feeding on flourished and there is enough for everyone. And meat-eating dinosaurs became lesser and lesser. And this cycle goes on when the plants are dying off.   How the dinosaurs died off? I do not have a ready answer to that but I will find that out.

      DPM Lee's unofficial visit to Taiwan had caused a strain in Singapore-China relationship. Being in the upper echlon of Singapore Government, China warned that DPM Lee or any of our Ministers against such ill-advised trips.   I must first applause DPM Lee for making this trip! He is bold. He knew this would invite some sting from China but as DPM now, he still can be excused for such "ignorance" trips. when he become the PM, no matter if it's official or unofficial, all of his trips and visits would be very significant as compared to now. As head of a nation, this is the responsbility he carries with him. Still, I feel he did not want Taiwan to feel left out. This is the only reason why I think he made that trip. It may draw sting from China but it bridge a gap between him and Taiwan and "formally" introduce him as the next Singapore PM.   Indeed, nation to nation relationship is comparable to people-people relationship. We try not to stumble the other guy. However, in nation to nation relationship, the stakes are higher and the responsibility is greater. Hence, it must handle with much care.   In all, the visit to Taiwan by DPM Lee goes to show too to China and any other nations... "you do not bother who I make friends with." And it will teach all these big nations to respect smaller nations and their sovereignty. And it still shows that Singapore have a mind of our own. No one can push us around.  A well calculated risk ,DPM Lee! Grade A.

      I can't help but feel sorry for the 2 Officers convicted. At the same time, I felt angry with them. I felt sorry for them out of compassion and angry out of the fact that they tried to shrug their responsibility of the incident.   By appealing to the court against their conviction, they are effectively saying "I'm not happy with the court decision. I feel I'm not wrong." Apparently, I can see no repentance in them through this and I'm sure if they are allowed to go scott free, more of such incidents or even or bigger magnitude will be possible!   The fact is they made wrong decision and costed 4 lives to be lost. They have to live with it. They should be thanking God that I'm not the Judge presiding over the proceedings nor am I the persecutor. Otherwise, they would be six feet under by now, joining the four.   This is just what I had mentioned. They acted unwisely in the wake of one decision and the effect carries on and snowballed. First, they make wrong decision in the 1st change of course and it snowballed subsequently and result in the crash. Still, they maintained that they are not solely responsible and this impaired view of the matter causes them to lose whatever respect they would have gotten from their men.  It tells the entire nation that there are 2 responsibility-shifting officer in the Navy.   In Military Leadership, no matter what is the cause, as long as your men died while under your command, you are responsible for it. This is why so few are chosen to lead in the Military. This is why so few excel in Military Leadership. Those who excel are those who take responsibility for all under their command no matter what.

      (I think you would have expect me to comment on this sooner or later. Well, here are my 2 cents worth of thoughts. Please note that I'm not trying to be politically correct nor am I pleasing anybody here. If you don't like what I saying just shut this window and your mouth.Cursing me will not help.)  Let me first by crushing a myth. God hates sin but he loves the sinner. This is why while we are yet sinner, Jesus died for us. Yes, God loves you. Jesus loves you. However, let me reinstate this statement clear. God hates sin. Sin is going against God and what He had laid down.  In Creation, God laid down a very simple law in place: the law of reproduction. Only spieces of different genders mating would result in reproduction. God gave Adam and Eve the commandment to fill and Earth and subdue it. This was the "mission" given to Adam and Eve. If two people of the same gender come together and engage in sexual or love relationship, isn't it going against what God had laid down ages ago? This is sin.   No matter how the world standard deteriorated, one thing remains clear. Sub-consiously, there is still that consicence guiding human beings on what is right and wrong. Most choose to ignore this while some live in defiance. This conscience is ordained and set in place during creation time and it stayed on in us.   You might ask me how do I know this? It is pretty obvious. If homosexuality was right and those engaged in it believe strongly that it was right, why did they have to be secretive about it or ashamed of it? No matter what they said or how they deny, a part of them felt ashamed of this aspect of their inclination towards homosexuality. Why? Their conscience said so.   Homosexuality is a sin. Even in the hardest and weirdest heart of all, there is a conscience guiding them. Now we have get this clear, I can proceed.   It is not wrong for a church or temple or mosque or any community to reach out to the homosexuals. I wish and hope everyone would reach out to these people. Inwardly, these people carried a hurt so deeply embedded in them that it would only take a very genuine and sincere act of friendship and concern to heal.   It is not for anyone of us to criticise them or reject them because they are the product of our society. They are indirectly the product of our actions. By clicking on that porn website, you are inevitably endorsing the "Sex revolution" which encompasses promotion of homosexuality. You might say "but I'm against homosexuality." This is just the same as saying "I'm Green" and yet everyday you releases tons of CFC into the atmosphere. Get it? So next time, before you criticise anyone, look at yourself first.  I say again, it is not wrong for a Church to reach out to homosexuals. It is wrong for them to accept and tolerate their form of lifestyle. Yes, it is totally wrong. I know a lot of you are beginning to get worried at what I'm saying here. Let's use a scenario to help you to better understand it.   One day, your teenage daughter who is 18 years old came home hugging two guys around her arms, obviously drunk and drugged, head straight to her room. Well, you're distraughted but you still love your daughter. You want to help her. Do you wish her to continue in this lifestyle or do you not wish? Your response to this would be your response to whether you will accept the homosexuality as a norm or not.   Most people would say they do not wish their daughter to continue in this kind of lifestyle and they would take actions to prevent that when placed in a situation as above. However, if they would response differently if you ask them if they felt homosexuality is to be tolerated or not. Why? That's not their daughter. "Oh, some people are born like that..." Why don't you say "your daughter" is born like that? drunked, loose, sleep around?   I may come across as very hard but I want to drive a point across. If that is your own relatives, friends or beloved ones, would you tolerate that kind of behaviour?   Yes, God loves the sinner but He hates the sin. Likewise, when He sees you and me indulging in sin, He sent Jesus to died for us. He sent Jesus to change us so we will not be living in sin anymore. Likewise, when we reach out to the homosexuals, we want to change them. No one become who they are today without first deciding who they want to be yesterday.   Deep in the lives of these homosexuals, there are some deep internal issues that they kept close to themselves. These may be hurts or bad experiences. Their abnormal inclination arises when they reacted unwisely to these hurts or bad experiences. Our job of reaching out to them is to find these hurts, heal them and turn them straight and normal. So how do you justify accepting or tolerating their lifestyles on this aspect? You can't reject what you accepted as right to be wrong.  So the bottomline is..... Yes to Sinner but no to Sin.

      How awesome it was to be living in this time! The song was great. Somehow, as the names of the nations in Asia are being read out, I felt a certain closeness to all the countries. I stood up when China was introduced, not because this is where our Church is going nor was it evryone else was. In fact, I was among the first to. Ha! Few people know or many don't bother to ask me this but I have got relatives in CHINA!  It was great to be doing something for God in Asia. In particular, everyone was talking about China, India, Indonesia. I loved them and I want to go there but there's something in me that pulls me to the Central Asia where all the "TANS" lived.(Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajistan, Pakistan). For now, I will move to where the Church is going. CHINA.   Deep in me, I know someday Central Asia will be where I belong.

      John Kerry as President is something that is very unthinkable in my mind but that could very well be a reality very soon. Going by what it seems, I got a stronger feeling that Kerry could win the election. I'm a Bush supporter but I'm going to be very straight forward about this. Bush will not win going by what it seems now.  Bush's achilles heel is not the invasion of Iraq or the myth of WMD. Rather, it is his strong and firm belief against same-sex marriages and his refusal to adopt a political correct stand against gay rights. Bush had on many occassions said he remain tolerant of gays and lesbians while he does not approve of their lifestyles personally. Kerry, on the other hand, adopts a pro-gay rights stance and a rather fizzy stand on same-sex marriage. He agrees with state laws on prohibiting same-sex marriages but disagrees with Federal laws prohibiting same-sex marriages. Adopting such a stand puts Kerry forth as a crowd pleaser to me. By his stand, he makes everyone happy and they will VOTE for him. Bush's stand, on the hand, anger the gay communities and they had said they will vote for Kerry, not Bush.  You might question why are the gays and lesbians votes so crucial in the elections. They made up for small number of votes but their influence on the outcome is significant. Gays and lesbians represent the spirit of this world. Their lifestyle is that of a God-less, lawless and licencisous lifestyle. OR what people called "Liberal".  Liberalism is the disease of our generation and this world. At the tip of that spear called Liberalism is something called "Gay/Lesbians rights". Liberal is being interpreted as "tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others; broad-minded". And this "tip" of Gays and Lesbians Rights symbolised the ultimate expression of "free will" and liberalism. To embrace the Gays and Lesbians Rights or being tolerance of them is effectively saying "God is wrong in insituting marriage." It is also saying "We don't need God's laws and help when it comes to pro-creating. We do it our way." It is an act of rebellion against the laws of nature.  It is an act that puts us at a much much lower standing than ANIMALS! Have you ever seen two animal of same gender mating with one another? Not in my whole life of 25 years did I ever heard of it! Nor did my dad's nearly 60 years of living! Even the animals do not dare to oppose the laws of nature!  Behind the spirit of liberalism is the spirit of "Rebellion", the spirit of Lucifer! If we do not put a stop to this "tip" of the spear, I fear that the end of this world is slowly beginning to unfold in front of our eyes. In this last days and in our generation, the sin is not to commit the wrong but not to do the right.  Kerry, by embracing the Gay Communities and taking pro-Gay stands, did not do the right thing. My fears is he will be yet another leader who will be curse to his people instead of a blessing. One look at history and you will see what I mean.  JFK is one of the most liberal US President of his times but look at what his liberalism brought. Vietnam War and the Hippies Movement that nearly destory the United States. Bill Clinton is more liberal than his predessor, Senior Bush. Yet, his liberalism accounted for most of American's embarassment during the 2 terms of his office. On the other hand, conservatives like FDR, George W. Bush, Reagan and Lincoln brought prosperity and progress to America.  America is the leading nation of this world. If America succumbs to "liberalism", the world will soon be embroiled in this attack of the devil. The devil had tried "terrorism" but failed and it uses "liberalism" in the form of Gays rights. If the devil succeed this time, he will perpertuate with more of his "tools".... possible terrorism and wars.  God bless America!    * Disclaimer : All views and opinions voiced in this blog solely reflect that of the person who wrote it and not of any organisation or nation or group that he belongs to.

      "Every nation rises and falls on its leadership. The strength of its leadership depends on who leads the Government. "  I thank God for our soon-to-be PM, BG(NS) Lee Hsien Loong, our DPM. He is a proven leader and a tough nut when he need to. People always look at his background and say he is what he is because of his father. How many failed to realized if he did not have what it takes, even with his father help he will still not make the mark. And because of his unique background, I think, this drives him to pursue excellence and make him what he is today. Surely, he does not want his family name to suffer because of him and he would have want to show that he's not a papa's boy.  Circumstances produce the leader. DPM Lee was moulded in such an environment. This gives him a nerve of steel and makes him a hard man. You can say he have his shortcoming, his temper. I prefer to say that God can turn that into a strength or rather, it had its purpose!  The world democracy had eroded and licientiousness had taken over. To stop this wave of licientiousness from affecting our nations, we need strong leaders. Leaders who go against the odds. Leaders who stand against the crowds. DPM Lee is one such leader.  This is, I believe, his moment in history. The defining moment for Singapore and DPM Lee. I'm happy because I know DPM Lee is more than capable to lead us. Strength is neccessary in face of eroding morals.

        Question: What is the truest definition of Globalization?       Answer: Princess Diana's death.       Question: How come?       Answer:       An English princess with an Egyptian boyfriend crashes in a  French tunnel, driving a German car with a Dutch engine, driven by a Belgian who was drunk on Scottish whiskey, followed closely by Italian Paparazzi, on Japanese motorcycles, treated by an American doctor, using Brazilian medicines!And this is sent to you by a Malaysian, using Bill Gates'  technology.And you are probably reading this on one of the IBM clones that  use Taiwanese-made chips, and Korean-made monitors, assembled by Bangladeshi workers in a Singapore plant, transported by lorries driven by Indians, hijacked by Indonesians, unloaded by Sicilian longshoremen, trucked by Mexican illegal aliens, and finally sold back to your supplier in Malaysia who then sold it to you.       That, my friend, is Globalization!
