						   hey, um, i'm new at the whole blog thing, so i'm gonna wing it. i'd tell you about myself, like my name and stuff, but that might lead people to find this and that would be bad, yep. well, i'm fourteen, female, and i'm 6'4" tall. yep. i go to archbishop spalding, and i'm gonna be a sophomore. i have brown hair, recently cut short. green eyes, but you usually won't see them as i always wear sunglasses, even in winter. yeah, for the purposes of this blog, i'll be fitz, a character in my favorite serieses by robin hobb. (the farseer trilogy, and the tawny man trilogy) yep. what's funny is that fitz means bastard, and the character IS a bastard, that's one of the main story points. ha. 's full name is FitzChivalry Farseer, cuz he's the fitz of chivalry (wierd names, i know) funny, huh? i thought so. i have a really wierd sense of humor, der.  okay, now to the other stuff. me persona. um, i like video games, music, and movies, when i get to see them, cuz me parents don't like me to go to movie theaters, and they hate me friends, so i have no real way to see most movies. i really liked music, but now i can't get any new stuff of the net cuz me parents caught me. well, actually, me comp blew up, and i was gonna loose all of my files, but my aunt saved them, but she also found all me music, and told me parents, so i got shot, basicly. um, i love video games, all sorts, and i have a game cube, ps2 and some other nintendo crap, and a really good comp. yay.  um, i suppose i have friends, but not really of my own choosing. i get yelled at if i DON"T have friends, so i'm kinda forced to interact with others. that sounds mean, but i really don't like people. generally, they get on my nerves, cuz they're all 'touchy-feely' and nervous. and i'm not good at trusting people. well, on the most part, i suppose i'm a poser, cuz nothing ever interesting happens in my life. ever. so i have to invent things. well, one thing that is true is that i never had anyone to play with growing up. there are no kids to play with in me neighborhood, and for some reason, no one would play with me at the park. oh, wait, there was one band of kids i used to play with. we used to ride bikes together (i think) i was four at the time, i remember. the kids would always meet me at the bottom of my driveway, and we would ride around, but then they asked me how old i was (so i said four) and they rode off. i believe cuz i was too young. heh, but that could, of course, just be a vivid dream i had. most of my memories and dreams are so intertwined that i cannot tell them apart. i don't have much creativity, but my dreams are so detailed that it seems like it was real. i'll get to do stuff in my dreams, like it happens in a video game, and i'll often do the same dream over again, not the exact same dream, but a dream that has what woudl happen next. ah well.  um, i'm not very well balanced, hence i fall alot, and get hurt alot. so i'm sorta immune to pain, or just really good at ignoring it. so i get mad at people who wine when they're hurt. cuz i just ignore it. but they don't, they wine for everyone to hear. i am not much for mental pain, or whatever you term fustration. nope, i'm REALLY not much with that. or emotional pain. i'm really a wuss when it comes to that, yep. um, when i went to kindergarten (true story, or dream...) all the kids just stared/glared at me, and all but one kid ignored me, one kid asked if i wanted to play, so i said sure. but i wasn't really good at playing, cuz i wanted everythign my way. and that didn't go over really well. so i'm not good having friends. cuz overall, they either wine too much or too little, cuz if it's emotional pain, i believe you're supposed to share it with your friends. any other wineing is just annoying. um, and i'm sorta shy when it comes to people i don't really know, cuz i always believe that they're messing with me. so i usually dis them instead of saying hi... heheh. i'm working on it, but yeah. um, i usually just project a 'normal' person so that i can make friends so that i dont' get yelled at for not making friends. >  what i really hate about spalding is that, first, its full of preps, and i hate preps, even though most people think i AM a prep cuz that's the most compatible illusion. and second, the popular people think I"M popular. this just doesn't GO. people are supposed to shove me to the side and ignore me. that i can deal with. none of this, paying attention to me crap. yeesh, i'm used to being rejected, so it was really unnerving to see people accepting me. so i paniced and tried to fade into the background untill all of the social levels were set, and i can accept my usual place as 'loner' but this school has WAY too many smart peoples, where as it was usually just me, so i can't find a reason to make peoples hate me. yeesh. who knew it was this hard?!  one thing i haven't fabricated, is my attraction to *name erased*. *sigh* yeesh, as much as i hate humans, my opnion of them changes when i think of him. yeesh. terrible, cuz how am i to get him to like me? duh, with friends, i have to be his 'friend' first before him even notices me. why in the world do i like someone if i hate everyone?! ah well. (if you can't tell my now, i'm WAY too passive...) i don't really know what i'm apposed to do, for first off, he just broke up with his gf, but i'm not sure if his gf existed in the first place, (conspiricy theory) and second, a 'friend' of mine has her eye on him. grr. almost as bad as last year, my old crush (michael-boy) went out with my best friend (shawna), for an entire year now, off and on. and they're still going out, rubbing it in my face, not on purpose, of course, but yeah... um, i really like this guy, but i'm not much for telling if people like me, and i'm kinda intimidating, cuz i'm tall and not always friendly (srri, the illusion gets tireing to hold up) so yeah. *sigh* yeah i know, really interesting, huh? told you me life was boring.

						   weee! i'm all happy inside!   and no, i'm not high. i just realized something, and that kinda fixed everything else. yay! see, i was shooting myself everytime i saw someone being, um, how do i put this, 'extra-friendly' with someone else, cuz i never had a bf. then, oh then, i realized that i'm not a complete failure. i've been asked to go to dances by two boys, geeks yes, but boys none the less. (don't mention that one turned out to be gay later > matter , to someone at least. i matter enough to go out with. i'm not that much of a failure as to reject. so yippe! i matter! and, i guess, realizing that i suck at basketball, that i always will suck, and that i always have sucked at everything athletic, kinda made me more like i was. all blase` and all ^_^. now i'm extremely happy also, cuz i got my voice back! no, i wasn't sick, i just got my old range back. see, when i was younger, i used my lungs AND my diaphram at the  same time ! then i used just my lungs, making my range less. and when i tried just the diaphram, it wasn't good either. but together, i can sing again! whoo-hoo! so, i matter, i can sing, and i'm arrogant again (for good reason). so, i'm back to being the old brit that only a few people remember! and, i believe, it is a good day, and shall be for quite some time.   "sunshine came softly through my, my window today  could've snuck out easier but i've, i've changed my ways"   *insert 'i matter' rant here*   *start singing "somewhere i belong", the  high  part*   in the words of james, XD, but i'd prefer a normal everyday :-D ^_^  (and btw, the *insert name* is...&nbsp; der! james!) *does dance, on ddr pad, aces somin on standard* GO ME!

						   okay, besides having NO luck loging-in.. i've been thinkin. okay, now i'm gonna add some names to the people i talked about first post. me crush is james and me friend is jessica. that's all you get. now, jess told me not to like james anymore, but i don't really know why... ah well. i heard he just broke up with his gf, so i don't wanna say anything, not that i can really reach him. me cell got disconnected, and he's never online. grr. but, see, i'm not really sure if his gf is REAL, cuz of the way she was presented. no one had heard of this "sam" before (his gf's name was sam) and no one's met her. or talked to her. so. she may not be. especially cuz jessica was the one who told everyone. and cuz i heard that they had broken up before, but then, magically, they were back together, according to jess, and he just played along... hm. now, though, he posted it in his blog *gasp* so i'm pretty sure it's final. well, final as that gets, anyway. if michael-boy and shawna (me old crush and me old best friend) were any example, an off-and-on relation ship is no surprise.   good news! i got three a's and four b's on me reportcard! yay! that means i might get to do stuff! if i got another c, i'd never live it down. but as of now, i only got two c's this whole year, and one was a c+. ah, well. i heard that some of my friends are doing much worse than me, james even failed latin, so i'd better not brag. not that i understand that. dunno what happened, but last night, he seemed really happy, at least according to his away message, cuz i didn't really get to talk to him much, aside from talkin about morrowind a little. he didn't seem to wanna help me much, kept telling me it was up to me, even though i just wanted his opnions... yeesh. but a lot of people are like that, so i've seen. however, it was more of a hyper-happy, than a good-feeling happy. well, ya never know, his medicine probably kicked in ^_^. yeah, medicine, cuz he's got depression. see, now this is wierd, jess has some kind of bi-polar thing, (or she's just off, most people are, but i heard she's on meds too) and little sanko (friend of ours) has some kind of add or adhd, never could keep 'em apart. isn't that funny? i find people who are 'my type' and they turn out to be honest-to-goodness psychos. makes you wonder about MY mind. but if me daddy's obsession with dissing liberals has taught me, it's to be objective. yeah, i know, makes no sense, but i've been taking everything he says with a grain of salt since i was little, so i never take things for face value. so, i'm not being mean or anything, about that they are on meds, it just was wierd to see people who really need... *cuts self off* okay, look, i live in a little hole in teh ground, so i dont' see stuff like this very often. i've never seen black people before my basketball team, okay? oh, i'm sorry there was ONE black kid who just entered third grade last year. we had one korean kid, so i was used to asians, but that was it. oh, and there was a really short kid, so i was used to that. but most of the add peoples i had seen were messed up in the head so badly that even with their meds they were obvious psychos. or insanely hyper. the textbook def of a maniac. but me friends act normal, and i would never have known unless they told me. i'm not really observant. but now that i think about it, they do seem kinda off. not by much though. and this one kid, sullivan's his name, just ACTS like james for who-knows-why, but you can obviously tell he's just a poser, like me. ^_^ wierd to say, 'poser like me' makes me wonder... ME? like sulivan? *runs in fear* okay, got that outa my system.   oh, and i've taken to creativity. surprise, surprise, surprise.  yeah, drew a happy self-portrait last night, and been writing songs/poems, mostly after i get a strong feeling, cuz that's the only time i get creative > here goes:   "Don't leave me again  I don't like to be alone  please just sit with me  let me pretend that i'm home"   kinda creepy, huh? wrote it when james was leaving, last day of school.   "No matter what you say  however you might say it  makes me feel its worth it  to stick it out one more day"   after james told me somin or other, basicly to say "i'm just happy to talk with you" hope it came off right.  now how am i gonna do anything WITH this stuff? maybe i'll make a sig, havent' done that in a while.  oh, and insert tears here, for i just found out that ALL OF MY REAVEAN LETTERS WERE DELETED!!! *cries* that took me FOREVER so i hope alyssa (me old best friend) has her old copy. *prays*

						   i think the reason i didn't spaz before was because i was kinda used to it, even though it hit me where it wasn't suppoed to. to clear up what "this" is, basically, i heard that james and katrina are goin out, she texted him and he said yes. i ran away, of course, first instinct. then, however, i got kinda scared, cuz i was just WAITING for the fall, but, this time, there wasn't one, for some reason. and i can't feel itachi at all. maybe he's been controling me, hence i can't feel him, but. i just feel SO messed up, that's they only way i can describe it, messed up. my mind doesn't wanna think at all, cuz i'm afraid i'll remember what my 'reason' is, my reason for being. my center, as i said before. now, i don't really have a reason to do anything, and it's kinda annoying. it's like everything i do, everything i hear, is just reminding me how worthless i am. and i'll see my friend's sn's on, and that just makes me more mad/sad. both, at the same time. mad cuz they did this to me, and sad cuz i'll never matter to them. i just don't have it in me to do anything that'll make me worth something. i don't have the basic social skills to do, i dont' know. anything. and, i was playin swgb today, and i messed it up royally. i KNEW what i was suppoed to be doing, i mean, i could've won, it's just.. i don't want to, ya know? i don't have any motivation, any life in me. there's no real reason for me to wake up, for me to sleep, for me to breathe, for me to eat, for me to play, to sing, to DO anything. and it's just wierd. i went out today and played archery for a while, and i was making every shot. i'd just pull it back, look at the circle, and it'd appear there. it was so wierd. i feel like i'm in a hase though, like i'm missing something, like everyone's talkin a foreign language, that everything they do is foreign. i'll forget to smile, to frown, to laugh... i.. i just can't... FEEL. i think i'm too afraid to, i think it'll hurt too much. i'm, not right, i believe, and i don't know how to fix it. if i don't do things to make someone love me, then what other reason do i have? everyone's here, everyone has the ability to live, what makes me special? why do i live through the annoyances, if there is nothing at the end? why do i push myself, if no one waits for me at the finish line? what is my goal? my purpose? who or what do i work for? simply to better myself? i am happy with me now, there is nothing that i want for myself. the only thing that would make me wanna would be to make myself better FOR someone else. to delude myself into thinking that they care if i get better, cuz i really know they don't, it's just a concept that i want, and now i don't even have that. maybe this is what they ment when they said not to make your life an illusion, even to myself. because no one else has to follow the illusion that i see. no one else understands the lines i draw. so they will cross those lines, they will break those illusions, no harm done, in their eyes. and they'll shove in my face the fact that i'm wrong, the fact that my illusion is messed up, that the lines were drawn in the wrong places, that no one cares and no one will.  and i'm afraid to lie to myself again. cuz this time, i won't believe me. this time, i KNOW. and this time, my only reason could ever possibly be, is revenge, and that, too, is impossible, and i won't believe that either.  so why should i bother continuing? why not just quit the game, since i know i'll never reach the save point in time?  "why  i'm beginning to hate that one little word  for it makes me say those three little words  and tell them that i love you  that you are my only thought  that you're the reason that i live  and that another's love you've sought"

						   yet again, fate seems to actually LIKE me for once. I'm on msn's "zone" so that i can play star wars galactic battlegrounds with other people, and the first day, i happened upon the DS, the Defenders of Sovereignty, and if nothing else, they have tought me how to spell sovereignty... >  anyway, i also play some of the other games, cuz some are pretty cool, and i'm tryin all of 'em to improve my 'rating' (currently a 3, novice) and i went to the checkers room, cuz i rule at checkers, but chess takes too long, so checkers it was. and, the first table i went to play on, this guy was on, name was "ty_macwhak", and he was SUPER nice, first he wanted to know about the whole ds thing, then he asked the standard a/s/l and i told him. for some reason, he didn't wanna believe i was 14 XD, and you KNOW he didn't wanna believe i'm 6'4, lol. he's from utah, and plays bball and football over there. he's a center, like me, and he SAYS he's my hight, but yeah, sure. anyway, it seems like i made a random friend over the net. he said to be on tomorrow at 10am (his time, 8 over here, gar) and we can talk some more, he doesn't have aim or msm cuz his parents never let him get on, ah well. i dun know much else about him, but it's cool to know i can make friends with random people much easier than i used to... i mean, before i'd say hi, and they'd be all, what's YOUR problem... lol. anyway, this kinda brightened my day. :-d ((edit: his name's tyson, like the boxer... lol, and i got his email... NEAT!))  and, in other news (love that saying) i've finished the project, didn't take as long as i thought, cuz the second half sounds REALLY corny, so i cut it out. and i'm not gonna animate it, cuz that night i heard somin. somin terrible. but nothing new, nothing is EVER new. what did wesker say? "expect nothing so that nothing will surprise you" or something like that, i KNOW i screwed it up, but whatever. the news was sad, but not unexpected. and, i'm actually GLAD i heard it, i mean, if i DIDN'T, and.. ooooh, not good. yeah, so, good adn bad rolled into one phrase... lol. (and no, it's not lol, idiot) but i still wanna give it to him... gar, even though... OH! idea! i'll put my phrase on one! yippe! that would be awesome! yeah, now gotta think of the bg... hm... maybe i'll have THAT be a flash, with a translation following, or like fading INTO it... hm, the words there, in french, then translating into the english! wow, i sound wierd. anyway. if you can't tell by now, i'm merely keeping myself busy. oh CRAP, should have seen that before, i do a 'project', and the phrase rolls around... i mean, when i made up my saying, the day i was gonna say it, was the day i found out... and the day i finished this, was the day i found out this... hm. maybe i oughta stop making projects... maybe not. hm. well, prob not, cuz i've lost my reason now. i mean, you can't just go and take away someone's center like that, i mean really. someone works and works to make somethign in their life MEAN somin to them, and then ya go and tell 'em it's wrong. then ya say, okay, i'll find a new center, and then THAT gets taken away TOO?! i mean, really now, that's just not nice... not at all, but i believe i've figured you all out out, finally. what's it called? conviction? anyway, it's a nice feeling, almost as good as having itachi and claudia with me. almost. but different. because this is called arrogance. well-deserved arrogance. heh heh heh. or lol, as i'm supposed to say... *insert evil laugh*  you know it, IN OTHER NEWS: i think i got my range back, i mean, i SOUND like i used to, but... i don't know, mom says i'm off, going flat all the time, but what do you expect?! i'm singing, while the guy is screaming the notes, i can't really tell where they are, so i have to guess... maybe i oughta go back to singing some more girl-singer songs, since i can already do (to my ears, at least) the male-singer scream-songs. lol, anyway. *sigh* yeah... something else to keep my mind busy, just another thing to occupy this emptyness. *gasp!* i like!

						    *sigh*    dangit, i was SOO happy, then kelsey had to go and shoot it... DANG her... *tear* ah, well. he'll come back, he promised, and, yeah. I miss him though, and her, even if they were kinda wierd. Now it's like something's missing in me, cuz, i guess, techinally, it is. They're just gone, GONE gone. But if i get scared or hurt, he'll reassure me, but from behind something, and i can feel her too, but behind like a barrier or something. I wish they never had to leave, that they could stay here with me forever, that i don't have to live this life, instead just being with them always. I can handle it now, by myself, i just wish he was still here, and had my back. I know he will come back, and absance makes the heart grow stronger, but... It was better when they were here, it felt like i was, home, or something. Everything made sence, everything fell into place, i was so sure of myself, cuz he was there to guide me, to tell me that it would be okay, to remind me about what mattered, so that i would become strong. i feel like i'm in mourning, for something that most people won't even aknowledge in the first place...      in other news, i've been quite unable to sleep. two nights ago, i couldnt' sleep till midnight, and was so dizzy and messed up, it felt like i was on the airplane again. last night, i fell asleep around eight, but woke up at one and couldnt' sleep till five. my head hurts SO much from lack of sleep, cuz i normally dont' get enough, but i don't even get what i'm used to... i feel like i'm thinking through a fog, or something, and i keep waking up when i do sleep. it feels like i need something, like i've forgotten to do something, but i can't remember what. i've tried everything i know of, and yet i still stare at the celing for hours at a time, thinking of anything and everything, tormenting my mind with memories, and teasing it with thoughts of joy. I don't think i ever felt this messed up for this long. not good, but the happy is still there, just below the fog.      oh, and i really like the lead singer from "taking back sunday". i saw their music video for 'under the influance' or something last night, can't really remember, brain cell's aren't workin right. the guy who just sings, not the guy who sings with the bass. he was holding the mike with his left hand, and kept looking like he was lookign for somethign to hold on to with his right, and when the almost-final chorus kicked in, it looked like he was spazzing all over teh stage, and that made me laugh, strangely enough, at two in the morning... XD he really looked like someone i once knew...      oh, and i had this dream the other day, that my team went to this place, (which looked like a really big polished up verson of my next door neighbor's living room, with extra rooms and all) and it was like florida, sorta, where we all picked rooms and everything. I had to go change, but they had new uniforms, and they lost my shorts, so i had to wear the black ones i had on. the new uniforms looked like my shirt for comp apps II, but instead of a sailor scout at the bottom, they had a princess, for some reason, and i said whatever. i think they were individual shirts, or something, and i gave them a format i wanted, but they didnt' have the sailor scouts, so they put a pic of a princess and a crown. wierd. then we went to this mall/bookstore and i saw john walkin around as if in a tour group, and i ran up and tapped him. strangely enough, now mom and dad where there, and it felt like dad was glaring at john (didn't see, just felt like, and after, they dissappeared). anyway, john's mom was there, and when he turned, so did she. she said hi to me, and then john did, and i said how come you never talk to me anymore, and he said (with that look THAT LOOK!) "YOU were supposed to," and i said he was, he sighed and said he would call me as soon as he got home. then i woke up, and then michael-boy called me, who-knows-why, and started telling me all about his love life. he's got this one girl from pa, another from wv, and now he's got one named natasha down here. i'm so confused. and he broke up with shawna, cuz she got boring, cuz she never let him do anything ><>     oh, and i've got a project now. ;-) i should be done it in less than a week, provided i can find the program, if not, i'll have to do it by hand, :'( which would take forever. either way, it'll be worth it. and, after he takes some french, maybe i'll tell him my phrase early. ^_^

						   you guessed it, i'm still happy  for basicly teh same reason, but different. while i was in florida, i met this guy. by the name of dennis janson. he's from holland, and he's 15. (his condo was number 132, though, and mine was 8301, so we didn't get to see each other much, besides the pool, where i met him) and he was on the comp, so i memorized his msm screen name. which i entered into my comp as soon as i got home. back up a sec though. see, a couple of my teammates saw me hanging with a cute boy, so they figured, BOYFRIEND. i was like whatever, and ignored them, even though we weren't going out... yeah, so. then i saw him on the last day we were in florida, hanging with these chicks from who knows (volleyball players, don't ya know.. grr) and i, um, kinda left and didnt handle it well. (making itachi in the process, check profile) and kinda thought he didnt like me, w/e with the world, la de da. well, see before that even, i was talkin to sullivan, of all people, and was all, holy crap, i don't matter a lick, do i? (cuz i sucked at bball and it was getting to me) and he was all, you'll find someone some day. and i said yeah right. then i went to the pool and met dennis. yay. and then went back and said the guy was right. and yay, i was happy. met him a couple of times by the pool, etc. then teh whole volleyball-girls issue, and i figured i was wrong, holy CRAP was i wrong, and kinda hit the floor hard. anyway, we left, got home, and i put his sn in my comp as an afterthought. recently, he signed on and we were talkin. turns out, he thinks i'm 'okay' and basicly likes me. we'd prob be a couple if he wasn't in holland. lol. but still, more proof that i matter. and i got some pics of him! go me! yet another account in my happy world!  asides from the joy, i'm a little worried about my state of mind... or perpetual joy. unlike the 'happy man' i KNOW why i'm happy, but, it's kinda wierd... tainted, almost. i know how that sounds, but that's what it feels like. something will hit me funny, something wrong, and i'll be grinnig for a good long time, or giggle so high-pitched i can only call it a screech. very wierd. and disturbing. but. this joy seems to be a good thing, as seen at kelsey's party (another friend of mine). lol, if i was a tad bit less sane, i would think that james read my previous blog posts and was happy about it, the way he was acting. but of course, i know i must be off my rocker, not that i care. i'm happy anyway. i'm blogging no matter WHO reads this. and note to reader, this is WAY happier than earlier posts, no? i'm happy, so i don't really care. *thinks* but maybe i should. and maybe i should talk to someone about the habits of my brain. it doesn't even make sense, especially cuz i'm so happy. very wierd, i'll just ignore it, and hope it goes away.
