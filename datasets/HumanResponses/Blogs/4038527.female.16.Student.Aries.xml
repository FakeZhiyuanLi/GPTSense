I DUN WANNA RETAKE !!"     &nbsp;   jt: "har?? eng prelim oral can retake meh??"    chii: "??"    jt: "dat one was our eng oral lor.. or elz u thnk wad??"     &nbsp;   wah!! i was soooooo~ relieved!! dat was quite a scare lor (coz i didn hear jinhi telling me dat it was our eng oral papr).. i thot i had to retake my chi papr.. stupid rit??     &nbsp;   chii: "u sure anot?? sure?? eng oral oni??"    jt *exasperated* : "yes.."    chii: " OMGOMGOMG !! wahahahahaha!!! i love u sia!! i thot i had to retake liaoz!! hahahaha.."    jt: "yar yar.. can see ur tears welling up liaoz.."     &nbsp;   :P

"fine.. mebbe i dun look chio but no need 2 snigger lidat rit??? wait until i get my hands arnd ur sick lil throats n see if   you   can snigger then.." *mind mumbling continues*    den dey started to beckon me. weird rit? i dun even noe diz ppl.. so cant b calling me rit?       right?   &nbsp;   in de end dey  were  &nbsp;calling me.  why ? juz bcoz dey saw diz huy standing bhind me n eyeing me. turns out to b my   pri sch fren  !    i mean.. i was standing in his line of view so he had no choice but to see pass me rit?     sheesh!!     despo grls nowadays.. *tsk tsk*

       Vis hardly blogs here because she:  1. Had no mouse 2. Was busy 3. Was having PMS... and didn't feel that anyone would want to witness me spilling my guts here and risk getting clawed at :D.   Oral  I got an A2 on the dot in spite of me feeling so wretched on the day of the exam thinking that I would get a meiocre mark for sure because for once, I was baffled, unable to say anything on the very moment when people actually expect me to.   Ps. I really need to get back to the html world asap. I didn't even know when people start using 'strong' and 'em' instead of 'b' and 'i' for bold and italic respectively. Or... has it always been that way?

      *beckons towards the page* Enjoy  :)   I've learned from experience that there's nothing like a (as the clich√® goes) short and sweet welcome message.   Anyway, I'm Phoebe Pauline Valentine Sugiharto, Zhu Bao Ling aka Shinomori Iori aka Viscera "Vissy" Valentine. In collaboration with a good buddy of mine, Chii, I am here to provide enough Chiisy supply to last you just enough 'til the Kingdom comes (get the pun? Chii-Vissy &amp; cheesy ). If any of our posts offend you in any way, please do us the favour of posting a comment about it and we will *sniffs* embrace our flaws with *sniffs* open arms *blows nose and screams in agony, lamenting about her own mortality and imperfections*.    Lastly, I wish you enough sanity to last throughout the whole archive and once again, enjoy your stay :)!

      Chii was supposed to come over today so that we'd be able to create a decent layout for this blog (chii, lookie, i've got one for mine!). Yet, she smsed me saying that she couldn't come over. What we've planned so far is that it's gonna be sky related. The main ingredients will consist of Chii's photographic masterpieces with the majestic sky-view (from various districts of Singapore) as the subject, as well as drawings of her and myself to be stuffed... somewhere... :D  What you should expect from me in this blog is my not-so-personal gibberish nonsense, where my personal one would be flooded by those heart-to-heart kind of ramblings. After all, not everyone would be that much interested with me-seeing-a-hunk, me-having-pms sort of thing, right ;).  Oh and Chii, about those fangirls, leave 'em alone, will ya? It's not like I don't go that way whenever I see tall-dark-and-handsome (aka Ka Ying who sadly happens to be a girl~) or my dearest Mr. Kang (who, to be grieved upon, is already married and has a son in our school) or of course my beloved Aoshi-sama (again, the world spins against my undying passion, he's none but an artwork). my cases are somewhat similar, mah...
