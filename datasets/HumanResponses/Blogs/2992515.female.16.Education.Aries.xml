      There is nothing like fresh hot chips. Absolutely nothing.   Especially when they're sprinkled with spices and vinegar and shath-tha and daringly bought off those vendors you're not suppoed to buy from because you don't know how safe the food is. Authentic Saudiness. Ah.

      I'm not surprised. Who would be?  Very  predictably, my little summer schedule thingy has failed again. And I had even revised it. But just for the benefit of anyone (me?) who may want to contemplate its impossibility (?), I'll put it here...Who knows? Miracles do happen, and tomorrow I may end up writing here that I actually went according to plan.   6-7..............Study Physics 7-7:30...........Revise Almas's story 7:30-8:30........Write letters/post on my forums 8:30-9:30........Study Bio 9:30-10:30.......Break  10:30-11:30......Paint/Write the articles 11:30-12.........Revise Br. Elias's book 12-1.............Blog  Anyway. Nothing much is up. Yesterday, I went out the second time since we've been here, and it wasn't even worth it. My mom loves shopping, especially for clothes, so I lured my parents out to this clothes center...because it was behind one of the biggest bookstores in Jeddah. (See, my parents have this passionate dislike for my reading obsession.) I'd planned to beg my way into the bookstore if I got the chance, but by the time we came out of the clothes place, it was past closing time. I guess my dad felt sorry for me, so he said we could go today. I just hope the  Bourne Ultimatum  is on a clearance sale or something.   Right now, my little cousin is annoying me. She just wants to play house, house, and more house. Blergh. It wouldn't have been that bad if we hadn't played house every day for the last 10 days or something. And yeah, that's why I plan to begin my day 6 in the morning, so that I'm free by the time she comes over. (She lives next door.) Problem is, my mom makes me go back to sleep after Fajr, so it's  kind  of hard to live up to my schedule.    I've been thinking about things, and I really want to write it down, but the mood passes before I can find an opportunity sit on the comp. So hah.   Have to get ready for Maghrib now.  Peace.

      Oh God. I  am  in rotten mood. I woke up fairly on time, but what with the vastness of the book I'm trying to study and my sister's -what do I call it?- I-have-to-rush-this-task-so-I-don't-miss-a-single-moment-of-my-allocated-time-on-the-computer mood, I'm felling pretty sour by now.  Anyway. Originally, I was supposed to begin this journal/blog about a week ago. But then my dad suspended the internet service because we were travelling and when we finally arrived here in Saudi, we discovered that Milu was trying to sell the computer for a better one, etc. and when we got the computer, I could never find the time or wake up on time to fit my schedule....yadiyadiya. Excuses, I suppose but I really never  can  get down to writing. I wonder how long I'll be able to keep  this  journal up: the last one barely lived two days. .sigh.  What I really wanted to put down here, though, are my traditional 'summer goals', just in case I forget.  So here goes:  - Memorize surahs Yasin, Rahman, Kahf (at least the first and last ten verses) - Revise the surahs I already memorized  - Learn Bengali - Learn Arabic (this one I'm not sure I can do) - Write two articles for W.C. - Write a story? - Revise Almas's book - Revise Br. Ali's book - Attempt a painting - Decorate my room (but since I'm not getting back to Canada before school starts, I wonder how that's going to happen)    I'll add more later when I remember, insha-Allah.  And now, since my half-hour for blogging is 4 minutes over, I better pop. (I'll tell you all about my little summer schedule thing in the next entry, insha-Allah. And yeah, I'm also wondering how long I'll be able to keep up this schedule.)

      Back from Madinah. We went on Thursday, back yesterday. I wish we'd stayed longer. It seemed too short this time: we went in a hurry, left in a hurry. And they've developed so many shopping complexes under the hotels we only had time to explore one of them.  But grr. Sometimes I just don't get the Kingdom. The crackerbox complex of hotels around Masjid an-Nabawi has gotten even worse. Huge blocks of concrete with wooden windows (a pathetic attempt at recreating Old Arabic authenticity), huge blocks of glass and chrome, they're all the same. Sheraton, Hilton, Intercontinental, and Co., they're equally invasive and equally visually polluting. But the worst part is that they are filthy  expensive . They are displacing the cheaper motels that were once in their places, blocking view of the Haram, and ripping off pilgrims, who have no choice but to pay, sometimes. Or stay in dumpy motels farther away from the masjid than the star rated entities. The saddest part is that most Muslims in the world are below-poverty-level poor, and save up their whole lives to come to the two Holy Masjids for Hajj, Umrah and worship. With the advent of this big-hotel developing spree, how will they afford it? Only some Muslims are privileged enough to live in such luxurious hotels: the majority of others will be displaced to the 'dumpy motels' where people are packed into the rooms. Worse, they won't even be able to come for the lack of funds. Why does Saudi Arabia do this? They should be making it easier, not harder. If the government has such an insatiable hunger for huge concrete blocks, they can make them government subsidized. God knows how many million-billion-dollar palaces they make for themselves. It won't harm them to dedicate a few of those millions for affordable rooms. But no, commercialization and profits for the sheikhs are so much more important.  Anyway. I read  The Fundamentals of Tawheed  (by Abu Ameenah Bilal Phillips) on the way and back, and wow, was it enlightening. A lot of those little 'whisperings' of doubt and uncertainty I had about certain issues were answered, and it's just a book on basics. I'm thinking I should use it for the Islamic youth meetings I want to start here before I leave.  The youth meetings are a problem. The only other person I know my age right now who could take over when I leave, insha-Allah, is Inaya. And she is not even remotely interested. Lamia was the only person who really cared, but she left for England when her mom's cancer got worse. She was very popular, too, so people came just to be friends with her, but I have absolutely no charm and my grandfather is not an Islamic celebrity. But there is some hope. My aunt says this girl called Mardhia will be moving close to us, who's very active in the youth meetings my aunt runs on. It's not in English though, so we don't feel really comfortable there. But Mardhia goes to an English school, so it'll be all well and fine, if she does move.  Anyway. So...why haven't I been blogging? (I feel this responsibility to explain, although my audience probably does not exceed 1. :P Or maybe I just need something to write about that doesn't make me start another binge on self-pity or hopelessness.)  -Most importantly, Saudi Telecom. They've done something to our line that doesn't allow it to dial the ISP number. And they will not fix it. Oh, they say they try. Every time my dad calls, they give us a number, and tell us it'll be fixed after 4 hours, max, 24. After about 2 weeks, it's still not working. So my sister and I go over to my aunt's apt. (next door) to go online. But their computer room AC has broken down, and summer in Saudi is no dream. So I just don't go. -Every time I try to write an entry, something happens to disturb it. -For a while there, Saudi Arabia blocked access to all .blogspot.com URLs. I just didn't feel like posting on a blog I couldn't access.  Not that I didn't try to update. These are two of my unfinished attempts, sometime during my long absence.  "I guess every teenager has their own little way of maturing when they grow up. Their own little 'test' that forces them to see that life's not all that cracked up to be as they make it out. Mine was a fling with something resembling OCD. My sister's is a fling with anorexia-and God help me while it lasts."  and  "Whataday. Actually, no. All I did was finish off  The Harvester , try to learn glycolysis (only read through half the process), learn another column of the driver's license book thing, and finish  Hard Times . (Wow. That sounds a lot. But if you have 13 hours to do it in, and the two books almost done, guess how long it left me idle.)   Hard Times  is a peculiar book. True, none of Dickens' books are 'usual', but this one seemed especially different. But I'm hardly any judge, considering this is only the second of his books I've read. And there is something unique about his characters, too. They are so uncompromisingly real, yet...are there really any people who believe so constrictingly in 'Fact' and 'Reason'? And I love the way he pokes fun at thMaybe those cruel dictators...but still. It wasn't as sad as  Great Expectations , but poor Louisa." (No, you're not supposed to get it. Yes, it is incoherent. What else do you expect from an entry abandoned in the process of editing?)  In true blog style, the second entry was written before the first. :D   Anyway...if you're reading this, it's because I've braved the heat, or the phone line's fixed.
