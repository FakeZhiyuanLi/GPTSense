      Well, the day of office-with-door draws nigh...but as yet I'm still right in the middle of a lobby-like expanse, my monitor exposed to all. That, combined with no computer at home, is my excuse for a week and a half of no posting. I'm sidelined in the Michael Moore debate; I still haven't seen the damn thing, though I hope to this week. I'd like to weigh in, then, on another movie debate: one that has long divided people who otherwise seem to agree on such things. That's the Will Farrell Question, given fresh relevance by Anchorman, which I've now seen twice. It's the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I know some folks -- Seth and Alan for example –- who can’t stand Farrell. I can understand: I never thought Chris Farley’s “look at me, I’m fat and yelling” was funny, so their dislike of Farrell’s “look at me, I’m hairy and yelling” makes sense. But Farrell’s got something Farley didn’t, and that’s an absurdist love for words. I think he’s seen as just a pratfalling physical comedian who takes off his clothes way, way too much. But what he’s really good at is deadpanning the tortured logic of his characters. You get it right at the beginning of Anchorman (which he co-wrote): “The Human Torch was denied a bank loan.” “Bark twice if you’re in Milwaukee.” Basically, I think Farrell’s enough of a writer that Anchorman would be funny on paper, in a way that other SNL-inspired, like-minded comedies (Austin Powers, even) wouldn’t be. Paul Rudd (Phoebe’s milquetoast boyfriend on Friends) is also hilarious, as is that guy from the Daily Show, and of course Vince Vaughn. The Farrell thing is probably the most divisive comedy issue of our generation, though the Rushmore/Royal Tennenbaums (Are they funny, or is Wes Anderson a pretentious jerk?) comes close. And I think Rushmore is the best teen comedy ever, in the interest of full disclosure.  The other great movie I saw over the weekend was Before Sunset. I’ve never seen Before Sunrise, but that didn’t really matter; they give you all the backstory you need. Anyway, it was pretty much a perfect movie, especially given the fact that a feature-length, real-time conversation could easily have had me gnawing at the armrests trying to escape. Or, just walking out. But no. The dialogue (written by the actors in this one, too) inflates into interesting but abstract considerations of mortality, love, whatever –- and just as you think it’s getting pretty unrealistic, the conversation takes some turn. It somehow feels like a real conversation while, at the same time, like a philosophical treatise. And those of you who have lived in Paris are retarded if you don’t see it, because they just walk around the whole time and you’ll probably recognize some place you bought a baguette or fought Nazis or whatever.  Movies. Where would we eat our popcorn without them? Back into the fray...

      Well, here goes. My first post. Kind of, anyway: for a couple of days, as Joel noticed, I had the word "test" up here. It was minimalist and beautiful in its way, and I've got to warn you that it probably isn't going to get much better than the "test" heyday. I am not above posting recipes. I am not even above posting pictures of recipes that I've made. I am, at heart, stifilingly boring in a lot of ways and I'm sure this blog will bear yawning witness to that fact.        Still there?  I should let interested parties know: I got promoted last week to copy editor! No more editorial assisting for me. I get a raise, which is nice, but I also get my own office, which is just phenomenal. That's right, a door that closes or remains open according to my whims (or prevailing winds). My "Person X" problems -- a common office malady well-documented by Joel -- are all but over.  Since I am at work now and still exposed to the walkabout elements, this post has to end. But speaking of work, I want to spread the word about a guy I work with and his columns. They are not for the politically faint of heart -- but then, neither is 2004. But if you like your humor distilled over a rusted-out engine block, check out what Joe Bageant has to say. Also, check out the fact that I got these links to actually work, and please tell me if they don't!   urlLink Staring Down the Jackals   urlLink Mash Note For the Girl With the Leash   urlLink Crank Reflections on the 4th of July   This last one is the least incendiary and, not coincidentally, the least interesting and well-written...but it does have the funniest opening paragraph I've read in a column in a long, long time.
