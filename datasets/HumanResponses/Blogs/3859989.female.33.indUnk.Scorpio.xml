      After 2 days in a row of getting my son on the school bus late, I realize something. The alarm clock in the bedroom is 30 minutes off from regular time! 30 minutes late.And who would do something so phenonimally stupid? My husband would. See...he works nights. So he gets up in the afternoon. But does he tell me he's done this to MY clock? NO. When I call him to ask him if he did this(which I already know he did)does he apologize? NO. He never apologizes. My angry response negates an apology. See...things are always about him. Screw what the rest of us need. He set that clock to HIS work time. Never mind that he never needs it to wake up. I wake him up, or the kids wake him up.   Ever been so pissed you can't go back to sleep even though you are dead tired?

      My son's name is Tiger and he has Autism. He is almost 6. He is brilliant, beautiful, sweet, and yet no one out in the world sees that. They see a kid who can't talk, and who squeals alot, especially if he is upset. He has a lot of communication problems, but he has progressed so far since we found out he had a problem to begin with.  There are alot of people who have children with Autism in Plano,TX. I haven't really met anyone who has one like mine. Maybe I am not looking hard enough. I have a 14 yr old step daughter, a 12 yr old daughter, an 8 year old son, Tiger, and a 4 yr old girl. My husband works night. I stay home alot. Its hard to get out and work. Next year when my 4 yr old is in school I may be able to work.   I have always had trouble getting out and meeting people. I am a real homebody and I think my kids hate that. Its very very hard to go out when its just me and the kids. Tiger is loud and strong and loves to run away from me. I love my son to death but some people's reactions to him are hard for me to deal with. Outings with him leave me feeling frustrated that we can't seem to do "normal" family activities.
