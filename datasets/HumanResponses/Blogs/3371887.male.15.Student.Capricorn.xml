      Annoying, judgmental, female, annoying, nihilist, 'self-rightous', pompous, preemptive, did i mention annoying? And female? I have four words for you girls...   Get Bent   Yes, I know that is only two words. But you girls seriously won't care about that, because all you care about is your stupid lumberjacks and oversensitive cousins, or undersensistive boyfriends of certain wonderful friends. Get Bent. Yes, I assure you, YOU can.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Angered? Possibly. Im tired of them.

      Man... I hate how people need to critique my way of life. My wonderful girlfriend is very tolerant of my ways, but her friends.... I just don't know. I was talking to her friend Stephanie on AIM, who took a peek at my profile and flipped! It contained dome verses from a song, "eulogy" (Tool)  Come down. Get off your fuckin cross. We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr.  To ascend you must die. You must be crucified For our sins and our lies.  Goodbye!!!   Which brings to my main point: Why the hell do people always think Crusification involves Christ EVERY TIME? Shoot... crucification was a popular method of execution during the Roman Era, not to mention a popular method of describing how someone died for a good cause. Stephanie and Caroline both took as a sacriligeous way.... well.. maybe we should study these without passing judgement? I mean, we all can't be god, now can we?  Ill post the entire song... its actually quite beautiful, you should hear it. Its about how someone died because no one would listen to him, even though he had good things to say... reminds me of myself.  He had alot to say. He had alot of nothing to say. We'll miss him. We'll miss him.  He had alot to say. He had alot of nothing to say. We'll miss him. We're gonna miss him We're gonna miss him  So long. We wish you well. You told us how you weren't afraid to die. Well then, so long. Don't cry. Or feel too down. Not all martyrs see divinity. But at least you tried.  Standing above the crowd, He had a voice that was strong and loud. We'll miss him. We'll miss him.  Ranting and pointing his finger At everything but his heart. We'll miss him. We'll miss him. We're gonna miss him. We're gonna miss him.  No way to recall What it was that you had said to me, Like I care at all.  But you were so loud. You sure could yell. You took a stand on every little thing And so loud.  "I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone and the symbol on you. So he bashes his skull through the window while over looking the sea. Twilight amber ego. We were amused by this"  Standing above the crowd, He had a voice that was strong and loud and I Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so Eager to identify with Someone above the ground, Someone who seemed to feel the same, Someone prepared to lead the way, with Someone who would die for me.  Will you? Will you now? Would you die for me? Don't you fuckin lie.  Don't you step out of line. Don't you step out of line. Don't you step out of line. Don't you fuckin lie.  You've claimed all this time that you would die for me. Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own  eulogy?  He had alot to say. He had alot of nothing to say. He had alot to say. He had alot of nothing to say.  Come down. Get off your fuckin cross. We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr.  To ascend you must die. You must be crucified For our sins and our lies.  Goodbye!!!    Whatever..... take your own interpertation, but it's like poetry.

      Since the beginning of.... time.... I have been against using a diary, journal, etc. mainly because I know they are meant to be read. No matter how high-tech security you have, it still gets broken into, and read. I haven't seen the point of one. But now... now I suppose that is my point. Here I can post all the crap I want to say, but can't because people don't seem to like it comign from me. Here.... here is my salvation.
