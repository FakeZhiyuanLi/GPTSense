      A few days back my bestfriend's father had a mild heart attack. A few years back my father had a mild heart attack. It made me realized how precious life is and the people in our life are.  The thought of losing these people, makes tears roll down my cheeks.  It made me appreciate who and how much they mean to me. I've always taken it for granted that my parents will always be there through out my life, never realizing that I would part from them. And thinking back of all the traumas and anger that I've put my parents thru, I can never say Thank You enough to them for being patience, for being loving, for being supportive, for loving each and every child unconditionally. I particularly have been the "devil child" in the family. Always rebellious, always doing things my way, throwing tantrums and never thinking about the feelings of others.  And to look back and remember that no matter what they were still by my side, makes tears roll down my cheeks.  Mama, I love you for your love to all your children. I love you for always understanding my need to be different. I love you for listening to all my crap and lies. I love you for all the soul food cooking you have made for me. I love you for all the tears I have made you shed. I love you for accepting me for who I am. And above all I love you for the unconditional love you have taught me.  Daddy, I love you for the time you spend with me. I love you for all the advise you have given me. I love you for always being there for me. I love you for the nonsense and heartache that I have given you. I love you for the education you have given me. And I love you for the strength of living on my own two feet that you have taught me.  Lots of ❤, Your Daughter    24th June 2004 Thursday 14:17 hrs

      Hurry up I told myself. It's nearly 10am. "The number you have dialed is not in service" said the operator. So I called up the house instead. Ring...ring...ring...ring..."Hallo" as Neneq's sweet voice was heard on the other end. And so I told her that I'd be there in 10 minutes. Dashed straight to the kitchen to put yesterday's dinner plate into the sink amongst the other stuff that I've chucked in there. Wash it later...I'm late, I'm late. The cats are meowing....trash had to be taken out. "Omegodd, cool it, you all don't get to have your wet food till 12 noon" I said to them. There I go locking up the house, got into the lift and pressed "0". Scrambling thru my handbag and I realised I've done it again! My PHONE!!! Straight up I shoot again, into the house I went. Godammit, where the fuck did I leave my phone???? In the study? No!..In the bedroom? No!...Maybe I left it in the living room. Nope, not there either!..... Ah, I used the iron just now I'm sure it's there. Nope!......Damn it, it was in the kitchen!!!!    23rd June 2004 Wednesday 01:20 pm

      In my life I have learned that life is what you get when you live it  Live it like how you wanna live it Do it cause you wanna do it  There is no other  Moments like this do I treasure To know that I’ve lived life like there is no other  Sorrow and pain are in my vain With that I do learn  In strength I do stand Cause I am who I am     22nd June 2003 Sunday

      My best friend called yesterday night with some awesome news.... Her cat may be pregnant. But we can't be sure until Boogie goes to the vet to get it confirmed. All night long we've been talking about how exciting it would be to have new additions to our CaT family.  Today my best friend called to say "Boogie Is Pregnant!!!!" And we both screamed and screamed with Joy! You can't imagine how great this news is for us. The last time I got this excited with a pregnant CaT was 14 years back when my sister's cat gave birth to a litter of 5. Man, that was the highlight of my life at the age of 15. I was there to see the beauty of birth.  Ira is on the way back from the Vet now and headed to the pet shop to get all the necessary things to prepare. The basket, the kitten food [which is for the nursing mom] and I won't be surprise if she even get collars for the kittens straight away...hehehehe.   Boogie is giving birth in 3 weeks time. CaTs carry their kittens for 56 days I was told.   And the best part of all, my CaTs Lenny & Max are gonna be uncles!!  One thing for sure is that Boogie will have a change of behavior. She'll turn on her natural motherly instinct. This is something that I've notice with my own CaTs. As soon as we got the latest additions to our Cat family which are Lenny & Max, Mauiee has been more down to earth so to say, licking them every minute she gets but she is still looney as ever. She acts like a mentor, a figure to follow. So many of Mauiee's traits has been passed on to the 2 boys. I find that very similar with us humans.   No matter what kind of creature you are, you'll always evolve when new things springs along.   Here's to Boogie & her kittens.

      Did some grocery shopping the other day with a friend of mine.   It's funny when you pick up an item and ask yourself if you really need to get it right now or can you do without it till your next trip to the shop. That's what happen to me.  Had a list of items on my mind that I needed to get.....: shampoo, tooth paste, cat food...  But when you finally get to the shop and you pass each isle, you'll see other things that are not on your list. And you stop to pick the item up, look at it, turn it around like as if you're actually reading what's written on it but in actual fact you're doing some rough calculation in your head. And when you realized that "oh, budget lari" or "nope, the one I have at the moment will last for another 2 more weeks". You'll put it back on the shelf and walk on.   It's especially fun when you have a friend with you, at least she'll be able to help you to decide if you need the toilet duck more than the shampoo.........  Thanks for the ride Marilyn.

      Have you ever felt that you wanna take on more responsibility? I think I'm going thru it right now.   I guess I'm at a point where it's turning again for me. In short a "Turning Point". Where I feel that I want to take on new challenges in life. Things that I may have been afraid of facing before. To stop being Afraid that I may not be able to do something before I even start doing it.  I'm shit scared for sure to embark on this chosen journey. But I fear not, because I have taken that first single lil' step of a thousand more journeys to come.       A New Canvas   I am embarking into a new journey in life For I am scared for what it will be And at the same time eager to experience it  What it will bring, Of what is installed and What will be learn  Curious I am,To know of what colours it will bring Knowing that a journey is never a straight smooth road  I am ready to embark on this journey of mine. For what it will bring For what I will experience For the people I will meet For where it will lead me  With all that I have learned  A journey that will be traveled with all that I have been taught For all the opportunities I've had to experience. To put it into practice.    19th July 2004 Monday 09:35 hrs

      3 weeks we were away from each other and I learned that it's something that every couple need, to keep the love burning. 3 weeks away from you brought us closer to each other as we got to miss each other. 3 weeks apart from one another taught me a valuable lesson that I've just discovered. Love does not mean that a couple need to constantly be in the presents of each other. 3 weeks has passed and I treasure the time we got to spend on our own.   Love is understanding that Trust will always bring us back together.

      31st December 2003 :: As the New Year of 2004 came strolling along, we both decided that it would be more meaningful to celebrate it together in the comfort of our home instead of being out in town celebrating it with the rest of the world. This was something new to me as I've always celebrated it amongst friends. As we chilled, danced, sang together and talked, we realized that we both have gone thru so much in life regardless if it was together or on our own. We talked about the people we've meet, people we've been with and exchange experience that we've had growing up.  I discovered that thru my long journey of growing up I have had the chance to meet the love of my life but just passed it by. And I thank god for it. Cause we both were able to explore what god has installed for the both of us. I can truly say that "Things Happen For  A Reason".  As we both lied down on the floor looking into each others eyes.....he asked me " Will You Marry Me?" I was in a state of shock. Not because I did not believe I would be married to him, but because of hearing it coming out from his mouth so very soon at an unexpected moment. To be with a person that I will grow old with.   He took off the diamond earrings that he was wearing and put it on my ears. Tears rolled down my eyes, for I questioned myself is this truly happening? Am I dreaming? Somebody please pinch me. That was 6 months ago.......  The day has been set on the 19th May 2005. Which marks 10 years of our friendship and the beginning of a new journey.  I truly believe that I am the luckiest Woman, for there is a Man that loves me. A Man that respects me for who I am, a Man that loves his family and mine, a Man that cherish and values his friends & a Man that lives his dreams.  I Love this Man of mine....     13th July 2004 Tuesday 05:52pm

      There is something about you that amazes me.....  Could it be your look Could it be your attitude Could it be your tan skin Could it be your voice  Funny what it is that amazes me....  It's the way you love me The way you treat me The way you caress me The way you hold me The way you look at me  It amazes me....   28th June 2004 Monday 2.03am

      Buzz...buzz....BuZZZZZ....BuzzZZZ......Sprang out of bed in a shock because I just heard the intercom buzzing. Damn it's 11.30am already. Like a lightning I quickly ran to answer. It was a friend coming to get a CD.   Jumped straight to the bathroom and washed my face, didn't even have time to brush my teeth but at least I managed to put on some decent clothes. As I passed him the CD, I just realized that I've made plans with a girlfriend of mine for a "Pan Mee" lunch that I've been bugging for, for the past week and she's coming to pick me up at 12 noon !!!! HolyCow....!!! I still need to feed the cats, change their litter pan, take a shower, blow my hair, pick out something to wear, throw the rubbish and check my email. For a girl, that's a lot to do under half an hour. Well, at least for me it is.  :: I've been going to this particular "Pan Mee" shop since 1996. They've got the BesT Pan Mee ever!! It's situated on Jalan Batai in Damansara Heights behind Hock Lee's. ::  While getting ready, I somehow managed to invite another friend to join us for lunch. ThankGod for Mac's iChat and technology, telecommunication has never been easier now days. That gave me more time to get ready because it meant that my ride had to do a detour to pick up the other friend. Hehehehehe....clever i must say [wink wink]  The girls called and I ran downstairs, got into the car and the chatting, laughing, giggling never stop from that point on. Hey, what can I say.... Gerls will always be Gerls.  As we continued chatting and laughing about Men, Pregnancy, Kids, Parties, Shopping, Sex, Work and Relationships, I realized "What would I do without my FAITHFUL girlfriends to pour out all my joy and sorrow"   We were there for a good hour and a half, regardless that we had people looking at us with faces of "When the hell are you girls gonna get up and leave?". The place is always packed with customers and what made it worst was it's FRIDAY. And guess what...... Gerls will always be Gerls.   Saluté to SistaHood......

           It's funny how when you move out of your country after a long long time of being there, it's as though your whole past has been   eRaSeD,   and you no longer have the sense of convenient comfort.     In a way it's simply   FaNtAsTiC   since i sure did do many silly things that were not very WiSe, that i was not proud of, but at the same time, because the time spent in my familiar *HOME* was so much longer than being away from it, it's as though i was reborn, and now i'm just learning how to walk again.  But worry i shall not, because i will seek for myself well, as i make this new place   *HOME*.     a sense of   passion..     a sense of   belonging...     a sense of   COMFORT...     a beautiful sense of   LoVe...     At the same time, i have to confess that i sometimes do feel like "Indiana Jones" out on one of his   "great exciting adventures".     Every street or lane i go to is   NeW,    ViBRANT   and a   NeW ExPeRiEnCe.     Dried leaves have fallen to the ground, and the trees are left looking twiggy as it goes into winter.     The   chilly breeze that touches your skin   everytime you walk outside.     I look around and seem to notice every small detail this new place has to offer.     *~~~THE UNFAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS~~~*

            day in day out...  another day of getting to know a new place. It's been exactly 7 months, 3 weeks and 3 days since we've moved here and i'm still loving Sydney just as much as the first time i got here. I could live here forever!!      Today was a   BEAUTIFUL   day, it was cold as usual, but the sun was out for quite long today.      I was just hanging out at the park with my baby, my friend and her babies. A few minutes after we got there, came along a guy with his.    As we started chatting,   it was clear that this guy was actually a househubby(could have said it conventionally as "househusband", but i just feel that househubby sounds so much better!), and so he wasn't out with his son just cos he had nothing better to do at lunch time.      Anyway, that just made me think, wow, i think that's really a big job. A Special salute i have for the   "househubbies"  . It must take alot of   "pride stamping to the ground"   for a man to actually let his wife work instead of him. Even most women, who are now   "housewifes / stay-at-home-mums"   are just waiting for the right time to actually have some extra time in their hands to fulfill their dreams. Why not right? Since women nowadays have quite the same amount of opportunities to actually make something fantastic with themselves and help provide their family with a better standard of living.     Long gone are the days   where housewives are just to stay home with the kids, and keep the neverending laundry washed, clean and folded. Women seem to want more than just that.     Don't get me wrong, of course nothing beats being home, seeing your child   flourish into a full bloom.  Ask any mother you can find and they'll answer that the best thing that ever happened to them was seeing their baby grow up. That is of course aside from the truth of having to wake up every hour each night for the first 3 months.   STILL, it is all very worth it.   Of course you probably won't feel it up till your baby learns to smile and laugh(and definitely start sleeping thru the night), but believe me when they start smiling and hugging and doing all that effectionate stuff with ya, it's as though every hug, smile and laughter helps you heal 2% of those   dark eye circles   under your eyes that you got from the first 3 months each time they give you any of those.      And by the time they probably get to the age of 1 or 2 , you'd probably be   drooling   all over every baby you see, and again, you will be wanting another cute baby, not remembering how bad your eye bags used to be. It's as though you've been hit with amnesia or something.      A list of things women with a baby whose age is more than 1 year would have forgotten:     how you skin stretched out during the pregnancy ~   forgotten      the back pains ~ forgotten     the morning sickness ~   forgotten     the water retention ~ forgotten     the never-ending night trips to the toilet with our eyes shut tightly due to the bright lights ~   forgotten  and the forgotten list goes on and on...     Well, to conclude this very first blog of mine, i guess it really doesn't matter how the word    *exhausted*   becomes an understatement of our condition. At the end of the day, the unconditional love that we give our children will always be unconditionally worth it.

          Tomorrow,    my baby will be turning 1. It's amazing how fast time flies...it really is.        She will no longer be a    baby,    as she will be a    toddler    from now on.        As i can still remember very clearly the first few months after i've had her. My hubby and I were so exhausted from the continuous cycle of sleepless nights that we were not even talking to each other anymore. Aside from the feeding, diaper changing, rocking her, singing to her,    there was hardly any energy left for us.    The most we would do was look at each other with our exhausted faces, say    "i love u" ,    and fall straight into deep sleep. My eyelids were so heavy that once they were shut, it was almost impossible to open them up again.       At that very moment, the both of us could not possibly see ourselves where we are right now. At that very moment, everything just seemed to be moving so slow. At that very moment, we were constantly questioning ourselves    "how on earth are we ever gonna make it thru this one?"    or    "who's fantastic idea was it to have a baby?".       Now that the first year has finally nearly come to an end, we are truely amazed and proud of ourselves that we have made it. The past one year has been a tough one, as for so many things has happened and changed for us. We had to move to another place as i was just healing not long after the birth, and just going thru it completely on our own without any help from friends or family was a really big challenge. Yes, there was some really tough moments that we had to go thru, but now, knowing that we have made it to where we are now on our own, i feel as though we have come to another level of love, comfort and understanding between us that has been built thru this past one year.    We get that no matter whatever happens, the other half would be there to help us thru the day.    We're getting used to being parents and we're enjoying it more and more by the day.        I am truly grateful for what i have been given, it is all i've ever wanted and more.        I love you both...

      Today's already sunday, and C will be leaving for KL this coming Thursday night. I can't believe that she's leaving so bloody soon! I don't want her to go...  She's been such a great friend to have. Since moving away from KL, I've never really bonded with anybody new like this. Everything just fell into place. She's a great comfort. She's so warm, and just an amazing person.   I really dunno how I'm gonna be for this coming 12 months or so...(I sure hope she'll be back before that though). I'm just so used to having her around now. Especially this past few months since she has been on a break from work. She's my constant family. She's become like a replacement family member for me.  I'm trying very hard to keep myself together for this one. I'm definitely going to MISS her HEAPPPPSSSSSS!!! *sob sob*  But at the same time, I'm also very happy that she has this wonderful chance to go back and be with her family for a while. It'll all be good for her before she finally comes back here again to live and it'll probably be for good the next time.   C, I really don't want you to go, but the truth is, I'm so glad that you have this opportunity, so make the most of the time you have there babe!

      Last night, we organised a drinking session at our place for C. It was actually supposed to be a "surpise" get together for her, but sad to say, our plan didn't really work. Half way thru the night while she was with her fiancee, she was already suspecting that we're up to something, and by the time my hubby called E to say something came up and we needed their help to come over and babysit the baby while we go off for a while, she said she knew we were up to something.   So the minute they drove up, one of our friends who is really tall was standing by the window, and before she came out from the car, she saw the back of his head from the window, and straight away knew that we were all gathered together. Alamak...the surpise party wasn't so surprised after all! heeeish!   But anyway, we all had a good night. We had some good laughs, chatted and did some silly things together. It was nice.

      It's so bloody cold nowadays, especially the nights. The days are still quite sunny but the breeze is bloody chilly. The time now is 11.35pm.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  When you read a sentence such as the one written above, do you ever wonder whether the writer really meant to write such a sentence, or did the writer write that sentence because he/she is just plain bored and didn't have anything better to write?   Do you ever notice that whenever you're chatting online to a friend or anybody, when you really have nothing else to say to each other, either one of you will come up with the CLASSIC question of "what's the weather like now?" or "what time is it there now?" (if you're in a different time zone that is of course).  I guess the same thing applies for me whenever i have nothing better to say or do. It's like whenever i'm busy doing something interesting, everything around me seems to stay still and time just passes me by. And whenever i'm bored out of my brains, the weather issue comes up and i seem to get annoyed with the cold weather and time just seems to move so very slooooowly.  As you can see,  i basically sat down from 11.35pm to time stated below and all i have to say is this. So i think the best thing to do right now is actually logging off for the night as i'm in the "overtired" mode. I can't help but ask myself, how can i feel so exhausted now at this very moment, when i'm just 24 and aren't I supposed to be all jazzed up for a party on a Friday night?    Probably, but then again, no thanks, i'd rather sleep and see my baby's smiley face tomorrow morning when she gets up. Goodnight....
