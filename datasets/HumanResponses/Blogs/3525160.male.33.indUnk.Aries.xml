      ...I decided to braindump without care... with caution to the wind... how very brave of me... I am so proud.  The display of the inner workings of the human mind is complex, and most often quite depressing.  This is, at least, what I gather from it all.  Blogs have taught me this.  And it is the written word, so no matter how you sugarcoat it and make it palatable, somewhere along the line something will be incorrectly perceived and processed.  I wonder how many "friendships" have gone to the wall due to these blogs.  Or just relationships as a whole.  Are Gallup and Zogby busy, per chance?  So today I want to be thankful.  Thankful for my parents doing their best and not abusing me physically, and thankful that I understand my mother didn't mean the psychological things that manifested themselves.  Thankful for having been able to sing in a band, play baseball, do theater work... and various other activities that I have enjoyed over the years.  Thankful that I found a seemingly stable relationship with someone whom I greatly admire as a human being.  Thankful that she helped introduce me and the world to a couple of pretty swell rugrats.  Thankful that I have witnessed so much history and historical places in my lifetime.  I have stood on the hill at Carthage.  I have lived within the remnants of the Warsaw Ghetto.  I have walked through Brandenburg Gate.  (BTW... thanks, Mr. Gorbachev and friends)  I have walked inside a Roman Colloseum.  I have been delayed at Heathrow.  I have crossed St. Charles' Bridge.  I have sat at a bar drinking the original Budweiser (from the Czech Republic) while discussing the history of Central Europe with a variety of characters too diverse to divulge.  Not too shabby for a boy from Arkansas who was too lazy and caught up in life to complete college.  Who'da thunk it?  So, like I said, since no one reads me anyway... I can be reminiscientally thoughtful without concern for being misconstrued as being bragadocious.  I sure could have had it all a lot worse...

      If you've never had a true Indian dish, your life, sadly, is not complete.  Allow me to possibly assist you in this endeavor.  Chicken Tikka Masala  Serves 4  Heat level - Mild  Ingredients  5 Tbsp Pataks ( 450g Chicken Thighs or Breast cut into 1/2" cubes 1 Medium Onion Chopped 3 Tbsp Plain Yogurt 1 Small Can Chopped Tomatoes 1 Tbsp Oil  Method  Marinate the chicken pieces in a mixture of the Patak's Tikka Paste and yogurt. Keep aside for 1 hour. Lift out each individual piece from the marinade and arrange on a baking tray. Cook in a pre-heated oven 200 degrees C for 15 - 20 minutes turning once during the cooking process. Brown off under the grill for 2 minutes. Do not discard the marinade since this is the base for your sauce.  Heat the oil and fry the onion until translucent, add the tomatoes and Patak's Tikka Paste marinade and cook for a few minutes. Add the cooked chicken and simmer uncovered allowing the chicken to absorb some of the sauce. If the sauce is too runny boil off some of the liquid. Serve hot with Patak's Rice and Naan Breads.    ENJOY!!! Glad I could help...

      Me neither.  But, apparently, I am...        You're  Prufrock and Other Observations !   by T.S. Eliot     Though you are very short and often overshadowed, your voice is poetic and lyrical. Dark and brooding, you see the world as a hopeless effort of people trying to impress other people. Though you make reference to almost everything, you've really heard enough about Michelangelo. You measure out your life with coffee spoons.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      I admit it.  I love baseball.  This isn't just an "Oh, it's a great place to drink a beer and eat a dog" sort of thing.  Show me a dirt diamond with well manicured grass, perfectly chalked all the way to the wall, and I am more than just aroused in a passing nature.  My wife and I took our 4-year old son to his first professional baseball game this past week.  He had been to the games when I was playing and coaching in Poland, but SINCE I was playing and coaching, this was the first time I got to sit with him during it all.  Mind you, he didn't soak in all in like his dear ol' dad, but give him time... maybe.  But when he said...  "Dad.  Hey Dad.  There's one ball and two strikes!"  ...tears welled up.  Okay, so that's over-dramatization, but it helps to illustrate the point.  Just being able to feel that link between us was so cool.    We bought popcorn and hot dogs and drinks together.  We hit the souveneir (that spelling looks so wrong, but it's late so I don't care) stand together.  And, get this!  He got to run the bases after the game.  This was Double A ball.  Do you hear me?  His tiny little feet traipsed across the same dirt as the future multi-millionaires of tomorrow did.  Yeah, so he played in the dirt around home plate after he finished, but, c'mon... he's 4!  And it was so great when we had to stand in line to wait for the completion of the game so he and all the other little monsters could take off 90 feet, turn left, run another 90 feet, turn...  We had time to talk and just be guys.  He is so much my buddy.  Oh, and he got thirsty and wanted his Sprite, which my wife had down in her seat.  So, with him constantly checking to be sure I was watching, he independently marched himself down to her, took his gulp, and headed back to me.  He was so proud of himself.  He "did it by myself, Dad".  (Mom helped, but we'll pass over that for his sake.)  See, this was the same ballpark that I saw my first game with my dad when I was three.  1974 or 2004... doesn't matter.  The park is the park is the park... period.  Finally, Pop, I understand the way you felt.  I really get it.  Of course I don't have memories in quick mind's eye view from that summer day when Vietnam was still a hot topic, but if it was anywhere near what I got to experience, it goes a long way in explaining why I still cherish our bond to this day.  I just hope they haven't ruined the game by 2034...

      Some will call me crazy.  Some have.  I readily admit that I have no college degree.  Spent some time at a couple of our finer institutions, but didn't feel the need to be institutionalized at the time.  I married young, got a crap job with a great company, divorced just a bit later ('nother story for 'nother time), but kept worming my way up zee ol' ladder at the workplace thingamabob.  Then came the boss' email that one fateful day.  "Is there anyone in the group interested in taking a 12-18 month assignment in Poland?"  I chuckled, as did most everyone else in our quaint little department.  At lunch when I was talking to my wife, I laughed about it as I told her.  "That actually sounds like a good idea," she said.  This is not my beautiful wife!  This is not my beautiful house!  And sorry, but this isn't the same as it ever was.  So, after a few "huh's" and "what's" and "why's", I told my boss I was interested.  We arrived in Warsaw Okecie Airport on September 29, 1999.  Oh, did I mention that my wife found out she was pregnant, like, two freakin' days before we left?  Open plans.  Insert monkey wrench (preferrably thrown in a random manner).  Long story short... difficult pregnancy, flew home after one week, 5+ months apart, completed assignment early, new job & new company at home, stocks plummet, lay-offs, tears, paranoia, job offer... and back I went to merry ol' Poland.  This time, though, the money was bigger, and I would be an independent consultant.  Cool.  6 weeks on & 2 at home.  Yes, if you must know, I totally racked up the Frequent Flyer miles.  American Airlines people recognized my face and knew my name, even in Frankfurt and Zurich.  How sweet is that for an Arkansas boy sans university degree?  'Nother long story short... client alters contract status, wife and kid come back over, SWEET HOUSE!!!, another pregnancy (you'd think we'd figure out what causes it), wife and kid and B.I.O. (Bun In Oven) fly home, 2nd child produced, decide not to renew the contract.  This is the part where many of my acquaintances feel I went crazy.  You spend all this time busting your arse to reach the income-level you've always desired, then you realize that you're missing out on everything.  This is why I have been part of the nation's unemployed for nearly 6 months.  I just gave it up.  Took my toys and left the sandbox.  If you think it is all about money and prestige, forget it.  Those things are really, really cool, but only if you have a surrounding base (i.e., family or friends or whatever) that can keep you occupied and grounded.  Some people can wander around their whole life never really making a personal connection.  Those yuppie-esque jetsetters that think they look so cool flying Business in their Armanis.  But no thank you.  I much rather prefer the knowledge that my wife is right there in that room and though she might snap at me on any given moment at least I know she is there and I can see her and touch her and kiss her and feel her and hold her and call her "George".  Whoa, where did that Steinbeck reference come from?  Must cease and desist.  Don't get me wrong.  When I finally find my place back in the workforce, it won't be as an entry-level toilet custodian or something of the like.  But, the time when income and "nice stuff" ruled the land is over.  I like taking my 4-year old to preschool every day.  I like staring at my 10-month old when she sleeps (like now).  I like being able to touch my wife's hair, rather than stroking my own as we talk on the phone while separated by two continents, one ocean, and too many languages to count.  Kayla told me that it seemed as though I was in my element in Poland.  This is a true statement.  The pace, the language, the style, the people, and even the climate suits me.  I have two friends from over there that will be invaluable to me forever.  But, I have a wife and two kids here that mean more to me than any of it.  And I proved it.

      So if you find yourself impressed or amused at some point, it is purely accidental and unintended.  Have your giggle and move along... nothing to see here.  Hey, everyone is hooking into the whole blog thing, so I better get on-board while it is still possible.  Don't want to be the guy who "could" have bought Coca-Cola stock in the late-1800's, now do I?  Poor Mr. Pepsi, but alas... I digress.  Oh, me?  "Me" is an analyzer, an organizer, a planner.  An "ESTJ" for those Myers-Briggs folks out there, though my extrovert and my introvert waver back and forth on a daily basis.  In this sense, I swing both ways.  In the other, I don't.  Not that there's anything wronggggg with that...  One would think that having the inner quality to be able to go extro- or intro- is a blessing, and it probably is.  I haven't yet figured it out, as I seem to go the extreme in either case.  Or could that be over-analysis?  Perhaps?  Maybe?  Should I get over it?  I believe that the idea of a perfect life is the ability to maintain a high level of satisfaction, interspersed with lasting moments of happiness.  THAT is my idea of a happy life.  I've got that "moments of happiness" part pretty well nailed down, but haven't quite found the continued level of satisfaction as of yet.  And those "moments of lowness" can be painful.  Had too many of those lately, it seems.  But then again, those are the easiest ones to hold onto, especially when you want to release them from your grasp.  Still, I'll take 'em, because if you've never experienced severe pain and loneliness, how will you know when you experience sheer happiness?  Ya gotta take the highs with the lows.  Now I sound like a meteorologist.  But that reminds me...  Is it only me that gets agitated by persons stating how they just want to be happy?  Ever been around a person who acts happy all the time?  First of all, they're mostly miserable inside, and even more importantly, they annoy the pootenanny out of those subjected to the outside.  I'll take "dark and depressive for 300, Alex" over that insanely giddy oxygen-stealer... thank you very much.  Besides, constant happiness is impossible, unless of course you have a close loved one who is a pharmacist.  Ah, maybe I want too much, try to hard, give in the wrong way, express myself at an expertly inept level, expect too much in return, miss the forest for those pesky trees, or maybe I'm just paying for past mistakes when I was King Arthur's stableboy?  Who knows?  I'm certainly not talking about that last one.  Now I have taken my own blog virginity.  I feel dirty, but I liked it.  Qualifies as one of those "moments" (see above).

      Isn't it strange how life seems to stand still at times?&nbsp; Then, when it is ready to start moving again, it goes from zero-to-200 just slightly faster than the speed of light.&nbsp; Thank goodness that I long ago shed the notion that it was fair.  After working overseas for nearly 5 years, I returned to reacquaint myself with my wife and two kids.&nbsp; After about 2-3 months of being back at home, it became time to find a job and do the "man" thing.&nbsp; The problem is that the IT world here in little ol' Arkansas hadn't exactly had time to feel the movement out of the funk that was just starting to occur in the field.&nbsp; And, hey, in case you didn't know, savings don't 'xactly last forever.  So, finally, this past Tuesday, I accepted a low-paying position with a great retail company with the unspoken notion that, barring me falling flat on my face in this endeavor, I would be quickly heading up the proverbial ladder.&nbsp; We're talking about a type of Regional Manager role by the end of the year.&nbsp; THAT is quick.&nbsp; I would be called on Thursday to be told when to come in for orientation, paperwork, and to start the job.  But HOLD THE PHONE, MARGARET!&nbsp; An hour prior to this aforementioned phone call actually came, a great IT company called to request my presence for a little interview the following Thursday.&nbsp; Um... yes.  Now, however, I am losing sleep (literally!), which is nothing like me.&nbsp; 99% of my life I can turn off the mechanism and crash.&nbsp; So, here is the deally-yo, as best I see it, my fiznizzle.&nbsp; (Don't know what it meant, but sounded cool.)  The female manager at this retail place is a fantastic human being that pulled a string or two to get me in.&nbsp; I do not want to betray her, or even be portrayed as though I am playing from both sides of the card table, though, in fact, this is actually what I'm doing.&nbsp; I am hedging every bet I can.&nbsp; I think this is prudent, wise, and responsible for the sake of my family.&nbsp; But I have this overwhelming feeling of loyalty toward the person who reached out and took in the "straggler" from a different industry on truly nothing more than a gut instinct.  I have resigned myself that I will "Come to Jesus" when I see her on Monday to do my initial paperwork.&nbsp; If this is presented in an honest light of "the money you're paying me is fine, but the other place will pay all the bills", she should understand.  Worst of all, I knew things would work out in such a way as this.&nbsp; They always do for me.&nbsp; I just never thought I would establish a loyalty toward a specific person so rapidly.&nbsp; Things look great in the forest.&nbsp; It sucks if you're in the trees.
