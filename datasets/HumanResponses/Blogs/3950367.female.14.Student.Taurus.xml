      We all know that high school is like a little place we live in thats not called earth with different kinds of people .. and the people who look alike or have the same personality stay together .When u look at movies ull usually see the popular group , the nerds , the punks , the joks , the drama club and the people  like me who think they dont belong to any of those groups ( rejects ) hehe but still have fun with their own friends not caring about wat the others think .I dont think theres a good school or a bad school.Because i mean its just a school ur there to learn and balblabla all schools look alike .What makes school great is ur friends and if u dont have friends to be there while high school frankly high school WILL SUCK .I could have never survived school until now without friends . Unforunetly and fortunetly i had the badass class this year . I say its bad because in the end it pisses u off that every teacher hates u and ur known to cause trouble so there all after you mostly . But good because there are all those memorable times where u laugh ur ass off over wat u did in the year thinkin how dum but halarious it was !like the days u get kicked out of class on the moment i must say not so funny but after it cheers u up ..and u get closer to ur friends .Unfortunetly for me this year half of them left but next year will be a fresh new start and u get to be how u wanna be .Maybe even romance ... or a lifetime friendship !!!

      What kinda guys exists in a world? mmm a question that every girl asks themselves ... as the familiar expression sais cant live with them but u cant live without them heheh wich is a true fact .Ok they r a royal pain in the ass sometimes with their stuborness and when theyre macho but its ok  because as they say u find that one special guy for u in the world and that guy u dont really care about his bad qualities u can barely see the bad u only see the good . Enough with the corniness we must admit guys have really bad habits .. sometimes they really dont give a shit about anything --> slackers = beer all day haha but its fine but i say there are two four types of guys -->  THE GAYS , THE JACKASSES , THE ONE U WILL EVENTUALLY MARRY and THE ONES WHO R MEANT TO BE UR BEST FRIEND . But o well thats just my way of seing it , some people say there all the same but i dont believe that as i said every person is unik in its special way .*quote* we are all who we choose to be *

      "Shadow" I was 8 years old When my dad went away I was stuck inside a broken life I couldn't wish away She was beautiful She had everything and more And my escape was hiding out and running for the door  Somebody listen please It used to be so hard being me Living in the shadow Of someone else's dream Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me Living in a nightmare A never-ending sleep But now that I am wide awake My chains are finally free Don't feel sorry for me  All the days collided One less perfect than the next I was stuck inside someone else's life and always second best Oh, I love you now 'cause now I realize That it's safe outside to come alive in my identity  So if you're listening There's so much more to me you haven't seen Living in the shadow Of someone else's dream Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me Living in a nightmare A never-ending sleep But now that I am wide awake Then I can finally be Don't feel sorry-  Mother, sister, father, sister, mother Everything's cool now Mother, sister, father, sister, mother Everything's cool now Oh, my life is good I've got more than anyone should Oh, my life is good And the past in the past  I was living in the shadow Of someone else's dream Trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me I'm living in a new day I'm living it for me And now that I am wide awake Then I can finally be Don't feel sorry for me Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me  Living in, living in, living in the shadow Living in, living in, living in a new day

      alright so wat can i say .. this is the easiest way for me to say wat i think .. without caring about wat anybody has to say about it ...i mean i care wat people have to say and everything ... but its just sometimes they dont understand and stuff  i dont expect them to understand ... its nothin depressing its my opinion about the world . and the life around me . frankly i must say i dont have a miserable life its a actaully very good after all i have love friends family and good time on weekends and i can go somewhere in life .. despite all the moving and saying goodbye to my loveones .. like paul caro margo ranitea  amelie ziza ..( this guy patrice i met ) just people like that im different with and who dont mind wat i look like and dont make fun of me for who i am like daniel hes a nice guy dont get me wrong hes like a bro to me .. but i mean his attitude wit girls and people in general he has no mutual respect  i know he can  be a good person but the things he sais just dissapoint me ... u dont tell someone that ur boyfriend is a looser cause hes going out wit u or u dont use girls like that and deny the fact that ur using them and he shouldnt tell me to keep it secret cause everybody knows and he blames it on me it was bound to go against him one day like i have this friend named alix and she got her hearbroken by him  * quote * the bruses on my heart * quote *and he didnt give a fuck  he  did the same thing to eliane .. and she cried for him more than twice no girl should be treated like that i believe everybody is equal rich or poor popular or looser ugly or pretty , because everybody is unik in this world .. so to start off this lil diary i should introduce myself im steff .. the one who tries to keep the world happy and who always laughs im born in montreal then went to toronto then to paris now i am here in washington ... the last place i ever wanted to go .. in reality i must say ihave no home  it sounds really dum but its true .. but i consider paris and montreal my two main homes  anyways i got here last year in 5 eme and now im about to go in 3 eme my life has been pretty cool until now i guess my boyfriend just broke up wit me for the summer hes a person i really cared about .. and he told me he did too i thought he was just scared to stay this long into a relationship thats wat another seconde told me ... but he denies it .. but freedom  is a word that breaks up every relationship i believe  .. it broke up annie and ivan me and bruno johann and ana ... summer is the worst thing for a relationship plus i really liked the guy .. i still do .. and probably wont get over him until i find somebody better wich is probably impossible i sound like a little girl wit a crush dont i ...  he probably forgot me by now im just a lil 3 eme  .. wat could he want from me . going out wit him caused me so much pain but so much love ... and love conquers all hahah ..  yesterday night i talked to my ex boyfriend in france damn he lookin fine  when i go to paris we kinda promised each other we would hook up hehe boyfriend or not .. girlfriend or not ... i duno i feel so comfortable around him its so odd i can tell him anything and if im not ready for something hell wait simply cause he respects me .. but anyways today was awesome i saw my cute margie shes the coolest girl we saw my favorite movie of all time  CRUEL INTENTIONS  she loved it too and i talked to my dear friend alix she s starting to like daniel again she asked me if i was mad i said no im mad at the whole thing not at her .. cause i dont want her to get hurt again by him shes worth the world .. she doesnt see theres much better for him .. but i guess shell never see it until she finds another guy  i just dunno how to tell her he has nothing more than another guy i guess its the fact that hes a rockstar maybe ... w.e  her decision  i try to help but it doesnt always work .. sometimes i feel like im trying to help to much when its useless im not gonna get anything back but i still try .. its wierd but i feel good after even if my advice didnt  help or if it did as long as u know u gave it a shot .. well enough for my life today ..or lets say the life *quote* ur past makes ur futur * quote *
