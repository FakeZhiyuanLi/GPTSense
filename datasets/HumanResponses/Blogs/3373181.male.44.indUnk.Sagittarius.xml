      This can't be all there is?  I'm stuck in this pedestrian existence, doomed to live out my days in the most mundane of manners.  Then again, I'm living a whole lot better than someone did even just a hundred years ago.  Sometimes insight is a wonderful thing.

      Today was the first day of Rock and Roll Summer.  To kick things off, I am going to see Aerosmith and Cheap Trick this Saturday.  I have a bunch more shows planned for the summer to include great bands from my high school years.  Bands like KISS, The Tubes, and Steve Miller are already scheduled.  There may be more to follow!  It looks like it's going to be a rock and roll summer!

      Remember Devo?  They said we are "de-evolutionizing."    It's true.  Think about it for a while.  Think of the hundreds of thousands of people who should have died because they can't take care of themselves.  There's thousands that should die from disease and illness but we save them.  Of course, there's the people who are too STUPID to live.    We allow these people to continue spreading their genes throughout the population.  Instead of the species becoming stronger by allowing natural selection to propogate the genes that allow us to survive, we are making the species weaker by keeping the bad genes moving right along, diluting the gene pool and making us a less survivable species.  In other words, instead of humankind improving (and I'm not talking technology here), we are reversing any natural trend for bettering our natural survival.  Maybe you could look at our use of medicine, technology, and welfare as our "natural" way of keeping the species moving right along the evolutionary path, but what happens when the lights go out tomorrow and we are back to surviving off the land?  I'll bet we decide it's time to cut the rope and quit dragging the "less fortunate" along with us.  When there's enough food in the lifeboat for two people and there's three on board, something's gotta give.  Of course the stupid and/or weak one is going over the side.  ......we are Devo!

      It's the oddest thing....the seven key on my keyboard just quit working.  Just one little key but often the key to some password, account number, or address....a phone number, zip code, or payment amount.  Ever cut yourself in an odd place.  Then did you notice how often you hit or used this place that you cut, causing pain?  Seems pretty frequent, doesn't it.    That's like my seven key.
