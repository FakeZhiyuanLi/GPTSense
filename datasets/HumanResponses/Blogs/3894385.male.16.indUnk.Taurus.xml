      The start of the day wasnt so bad i woke up at 12:05 watched tv for a while then went outside to mow the grass with my mom but as u know in my family when everything is going good somthing bad is about to happen and it did. when i was working on the front yard i heard this big crash and my mom came running saying she busted her head open blood was gushing everywhere and i told her to apply pressure to the wound. i learned this in football when some asshole cleated me horribly but there' s no scar thank god. my mom didnt want me to go with her to the hospital instead she wanted me to stay here and finish the lawn. i agreed and did just that. i know how she feels and its not good. hopefully this WILL NOT happen again. i just found out my mom is going to be okay thank god. well&nbsp; i have to clean up all the fuckin blood in the bathroom so peace!

      Today a Sunday will probably be the most busiest day for my parents, because they have a retarded baptisms to go to which I think is absurd because they will not even be the godparent! What the hell. I cant wait till we go on vacation because IM tired of people always bichin to us about their personal problems. To&nbsp;be completely honest I cant take any more of this bullshit and I think my parents cant either. The other thing is when we went to go visit our long and unseen cousins I've considered them close family to me because they are good to talk to they hang out with their parents they are just like us. Thank God they are close family to us. I consider them more closer than our other cousins who are rude and disrespectful towards our parents. All I hear when my cousins with my grandma is all this negative crap which pisses me off to the max. Thank God we don't see them that much anymore because I cant take it anymore. I enjoy being around are real cousins the ones that we just visited recently. My grandma tells me that they aren't our real cousins and I know that but they consider us cousins and as do we so my grandma can just go to hell. This is probably the most emotional I've ever gotten on a computer writing but its how I feel and its a good way to let off some steam so anyways I'll write back later so peace!

      Today at practice I felt really good and I think I have improved far more than I expected. Batting practice was usual I only hit 2 or 3 home runs {over the fence} I cant remember. The coaches or managers of my select team said I have improved greatly and asked me if i wanted to play up in my age groups but I denied and said I have to improve and plus I wouldn't feel comfortable because I would not be playing with my original teamates. Some of the people on my team are so obsessed with dipping and doing drugs which to me is totally insane. Their just kids nothing more than ordinary teenagers AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT SHIT. The only thing I think about doing is graduating from high school going to Baylor{because of its extrordinary law school} be a lawyer and then become a judge and live a very happy life with my wife and kids. Well thats all today, peace!!!

      It was one of the best weekends I've ever had. My Cousins from Corpus Christy TX came to visit. I was uncomfortable talking to them at first because I was Afraid they would find me annoying and intolerable. In those situations I just keep my mouth shut and block out everything. I could tell by the look in their eyes that they thought I was Stuck up and conceited. Who would Blame them I was acting like that but I was also sad because one of my friends was Shot and killed on the Thursday before they came. If you three are reading this I'm sorry about the way I was acting and I should make it up to you all. I mostly afraid and did not socialize because I thought that my cousins would think bad of my grotesque appearance{the Vitiligo}or white spots. Iv'e always been afraid of what people think of me, and that has been my weakness in life. If only people would know what it's like having these horrid spots. My Talents not my appearance have made me friends around San Antonio. When People Make fun of my appearance I hold My anger in and walk away from that person and show resentment towards him or her for a long time. I know if my brother were reading this he'd be like what the fuck is this shit!?! He treats everything as a big joke but I'm happy for him because he got a full ride into St. Mary's university but enough about that lets get back to the subject. The last days of school my girfriend dumped me and said we should see different people{easy for her to say}. I thought she was one of a kind.she was a beautiful Blonde nice and trim. Oh SHIT!!! I went off the fucking subject again!!! Okay anyways the people who were upset by my actions of not talking and refusing to do things like go Swiming,tubing,and my favorite the hot tub{NOT BEING SARCASTIC ABOUT IT}were Johnathan and Sara. Sara seemed upset the most I could see it in her eyes once I rejected to go swimming the first time. I felt so bad but I was afraid she would tell me somthing that would hurt me mentaly. She probably thought I was acting like I was better than her but it's not like that at all. Alot of shit was going on in my life. she should be the one thinking that she's better than me. She is because she's beautiful,kind,smart,outgoing,loving, I mean who wouldn't like that. Anyways if you read this Sara I hope you will forgive me for acting like a big jerk and that was not really my personality on a daily basis. I hope in the future we can talk like cousins talk and joke around with each other. Sorry how I acted it'll never happen again I guarantee that. johanathan is one of my favorite cousins because he never lets anybody intimidate him. He has a very strong will that nobody can tap into. He's a good person to talk to when you're down. When we went to sea world I felt unknown to my cousins and to my brother. Well thats all I have to type today, so peace and if you two read this Im sorry and please forgive me .                                                                                                Love Ya Lots CVDABOMB{Carlos}

      It's so late but i'm talking to friends who have all these problems with some girls so instead of listening to that bullshit i've decided to type this post. These past couple of days have been really relaxing but today in the morning the phone was ringing off the fuckin hook and my grandma was one of those people who won't stop until they get an answer callers. I answered and said hello and then she started rambling about how my cousins are all sad and alone but in the past their family did alot of shit to our parents so as i say payback is a bitch and i told my grandma that she is the only one i care about and that she should stop dwelling on the problems that my cousins face. Anyways i've started to realize how this year will shape on how i do my JR year and i'm going to be to busy to worry about my cousins problems. That's preaty much been my day so Peace!

      In the midst of a good day i recive a letter in the mail informing me that i've been cut from the high school baseball team due to missing the entire offsesson which really pissed my coach off. So all i have left right now is cross country which somtimes i resent because the runners are all skinny and jealous of my muscles. My dad didn't care because he says that running can get me more places than baseball can. I think that is bullshit but everybody has their opinions so why should i get upset? Anyways i have to try out for baseball again but i don't think the coach will give me another chance at it so i probably just going to stick with my select team because i have a better chance of getting into college with this team than the high school team. We play Carrol in an exhibition game at Pittman. They'll be preaty easy but not that easy. Moody kicked our ass but King fell mercifully when i hit that double that brought in 2 runsso in other words we beat them not very badly but badly. So fall ball is approaching and the start of my select team's offseason is near so i probably won't be writing in here occasinally so PEACE!

      Man this summer has been so awesome and long. i'm about ready to go back to school which sounds really weird. Cross Country Season starts in like about 2 days and after that here comes baseball which will be really tiring for me. last year i made the J.V baseball team but was cut because I kept showing up late to practice I was too involved with my final exams which were exteremly easy. I  hope i make it back on the team this year but i probably won't because the coaches at my school are the biggest fuckin retards. Anyways i have to concentrate on school becaus i have to pass that son of a bitch TAKS test. This month won;t be that fun because school starts this month. In September me and my dad are going to some golf thing and he says are relatives from Corpus might come for that event. This year is going to be so wild because now im not a freshman anymore so this time i can party more and enjoy myself and have fun with my friends. Thats all I have to write so PEACE!!!

      Today at cross country practice i was really scared because one of my friends who i was throwing rocks said i broke a car windshield. when i found out i ran for cover and minutes later i came out and found my friends saying some shit how im in deep trouble so i went to go apoligize to the lady. It turns out she was gone and i didnt break her windshield i just hit her hood. i was so relived and learned my lesson about throwing shit around. it seems so boring around here without my brother here, but he'll be back in two weeks. i hope our friends from Corpus come because i really enjoy their company. we have to pay them back for taking us everywhere when we went to corpus. i hope they come because we still have alot of catching up to do. this is all i have to write so PEACE!!!!!

      Somtimes i wonder if...... the person i am going to be destined with looks at the moon while i am. Ahh never mind that shit i just always wonder about that. Anyways i think i like a good girl whos been like family to me even though i haven't seen her in a while due to a vacationshes been on anyways i cant gather the courage to tell her how i feel due to my physical appearance. with girls in the past its been easy to woo them over with my somwhat of my cocky charm. but this girl ther is somthing about her, in my eyes she glows radiantly every time she passes by me. My mind is telling me that i have no chance because she is too beautiful and smart for me. im going to defy my mind and do things on my own the next time i see her. ive always thought of my life as a big book whos pages are blank but become filled once u start living ur life. this event has to be in this story and i will see that it is. I guarantee It.
