      so, on sunday, i'm throwing a pair of flip flops on when my cell phone beeps -    "fucking people are out of their god damn minds!"  recognizing the voice as my best friend's, i let her ramble   "so, i try to call you from my new cell phone thinking i'm all slick because i memorized your number, and i get disconnected after two rings...ok, fine, so i redial, and instead get this dude's voicemail..so i think, hey, i'm an asshole, i'll just cave in and look up the number because i obviously fucked it up....about 30 seconds later i get a phone call from the wrong number i dialed previously with this bitch on the line saying "yo, why you be calling?"  so i'm like "right, well, sorry, i fucked up, i dialed the wrong last digit" and the chick on the other line goes "slut" and hangs up - but wait, holy fucking shit, here's this crazy bitch again, hold on!"   so, she clicks over, and i'm holding, for what seems like a really long time, when she clicks back and announces    "dude! according to this bitch i'm a crack slut dirty whore who this psycho's boyfriend can't afford to fuck because he's too broke..i need to go outside because it's a nice day and find some john to fuck because i am nothing but a nasty trick...yes, you heard it, i'm nasty" she then breaks down into peals of laughter which then sends me skipping down cackle road....  so, whatever, i finally get to jersey, and we're sitting outside on her deck, polishing off a bottle of stoli (raspberry natch)when she gets the idea to call this dude back and flip out on him...so, she tells me to call from my cell because it's only 1 digit off from this random guys...so, drunk fool that i am, i dial and, what do you know, it rings and then goes to voicemail, so, not wanting to start a voicemail war, i hang up.  So, we continue drinking, and slurring and laughing when suddenly my phone rings...it's the dude   "hey ma....listen, i just want to apologize for my girlfriend..she's a little psycho..i'm charging my phone in my car right now so she doesnt see me on the phone...she get's really pissed when girls be calling my number and shit"     uh...right, so dumbass that i am, i continue talking to him   "so like, my name's david...are you and friend single and shit? cuz like, ya'll be soundin sexy and shit "    ok, so that's the point my friend rips the cell phone out of my hand and yells into the phone  "ok, this is the reason that your skanky bitch thinks you're cheating on her, what the fuck is wrong with you...you're trying to pick up 2 girls from a wrong number call...go back to your bitch"   and hangs up the phone.... she shakes her head and pours me another drink....  my cell rings again   "hey, it's david, so like, it's really cool how our numbers are only a digit off yo, like, you be into swingin' and shit?"   good lord...   "cuz like, me and my girl, we like to swing...."   that's when i burst out laughing and hung up the phone..... me and my friend finished off the bottle of vodka, chain smoked for a while and went to bed....fucking people are out of their god damn minds...and shit

      i am in the midst of trying to find a new place to live...at this point, my future roommate and I have abandoned any picky tendencies and are clinging to the idea that we'll find a decent size place that is cat friendly (yes, he's one of  those  people...*shudder*), in a relatively convenient area that is not on the 7th floor of a shithole walkup.  So far, we are not discouraged....we are hopeful, wistful jersey expats ready to challenge and conquer the manhattan real estate market...let's see how long this hopefulness lasts. I give it 2 weeks before he and I both lose our minds and are found shuffling around my neighborhood in our bathrobes blowing bubbles. In any case, the reason I need to leave my beautiful (though shabbily furnished - thanks to Jesus' homegirl The cosmetics, well, they're easier to validate, as, hailing from jersey originally, i tend to pile it on like war paint....but all the hair stuff? whatever...god, i really am a girl let's just hope that everything fits into boxes...and hey, at least my new roommate and i will never have to worry about shampoo..I have 7 different bottles in the shower as we speak

      disclaimer: I'm new to this whole blogging thing, so, should i fuck up...be gentle with me...i don't know any better let's cut to it..i'm fucking bored...like bored out of my mind.  My boss, the man I love more than my luggage (yes, a lil shout out to Olympia Dukakis), is..well, let's just say "away" for the next month or so. He's left me all alone in an office where most are either heavily medicated or those that aren't should be.  It's up to me to amuse myself at work, and lemme tell ya kids, it aint going too well.  Normally, when in a funk, assembling the toys inside of kindereggs does the trick ...not this time (my drawer full of plastic aliens, zoo animals and puzzles can attest to that). I tried the whole online shopping thing...yeah, not working out too well...i'm the twit who pays for the shipping and handling charge on items from sephora when there are 2 within a 10 block radius of my soon to be vacated apartment...*sigh* I just like getting stuff in the mail...sue me I was getting by when the boredom was restricted to the hours of 9am..er..who am i kidding, more like 9:20am x 5pm...but then, it started carrying over into my evenings and nights...that's when i stumbled across my new best friend  urlLink netflix .  Let me just tell you, as a recovering blockbuster delinquent, this is a godsend...no late fees...EVER...what a motherfucking concept...plus, again, i get stuff in the mail..score! um..kinda...problem is, I can't exactly justify watching the musical episode of buffy at my desk when I should be scheduling surveillances and shit so, back to being excruciatingly bored essentially, this is just something for me to do that at least can pass for work when my superiors walk by... here's to hoping i don't get caught...otherwise, I'll have nothing left but  urlLink amazon     urlLink
