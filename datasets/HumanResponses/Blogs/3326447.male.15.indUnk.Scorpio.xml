        You are "Waste of Paint". You can be a very over analyzing person and you are sort of lost. You aren't really sure where you're going with your life but for now you hold some hope that you will indeed get to where you are going. Oh yeah, and that thing called "love", you feel it's just a game of chance. A game you are not good at.    urlLink   Which BRIGHT EYES song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

              I don't know why I do this because every day is pretty much the same as the last one accept I might be getting a keyboard, witch is exiting because its for The Sexing, witch is the only desire I have in my life right now, yeah so I guess all I can do is wait for some good shows this weekend.............   Oh, here is a goofy picture of Dan who is also in The Sexing, and a lyrics from a band that you should know of....   Picture: ------------------------------------     Lyric: ------------------------------------ There is nothing for which I am responsible. Just this baggage that I keep carrying on as if I had someone.  OK, maybe there is a woman somewhere who's still thinking of me or a girl with coal black hair who's haunted in her dreams. But what they've seen, well, it wasn't me. It was just some lie that they slept beside. I kept this from them but I can't keep this from you.  So will you look for me in that strange, bright place. Where the statues bloom in the park. They don't need no rain.  Because how I ever got to you I have no idea. It's like some secret door, well it just appeared. So, no matter what I do from now on with my time. you will always stay here in my mind. I am certain of this and I am not certain of anything.  So I want to get myself attached to something bolted down, So that these winds of circumstance won't keep blowing me around. To when I land to when I leave there is enough time to sleep and sing. I keep running when all I want is to lay motionless.

      I like this song..........         Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever.  Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see. It’s getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn’t matter much to me. Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever.  No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low. That is you can’t you know tune in but it’s all right, that is I think it’s not too bad. Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever.  Always, no sometimes, think it’s me, but you know I know when it’s a dream. I think I know I mean a ’yes’ but it’s all wrong, that is I think I disagree. Let me take you down, ’cause I’m going to strawberry fields. Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout. Strawberry fields forever. Strawberry fields forever.

          Today was any other boring day, except there was a "fight" with was nothing new at east Bakersfield high school let me tell ya.  Same old periods..Same old lunch same gay pickle ball at P.E. with Mr. triggs, if you don't know who Mr triggs is hes a P.E. teacher with no calf muscle yeah im sorry but one of the requirements for a P.E. teacher should be to have TWO CALF MUSCLES, if you cannot run....Your not hired...But that's just my opinion im sure they didn't have many pe teachers wanting to teach at east.
