      It is only Saturday, and I cannot wait for this weekend to end. The temp agency believes they have something lined up for me next week, so I’m happy about that. The more time I spend in this house, the weirder I am becoming, and I’ve already been called  odd . Although, I was informed that  odd  isn’t necessarily a bad thing, viva la Canada.  So Thursday I get home from jogging to find that a massage table was delivered to my house. My parents purchased a professional  massage table . Hm.  Last night I went to m0’lin0’s and –gmg- for some quality time, and on my way home I was next to a pick up truck. As the truck sped ahead of me (b/c I am a slow driver) I noticed that behind its two rear wheels dwelled a set of   mock-testicles  . Yes. The truck had balls. It was, well… these are the moments that we wish we were like m0’lin0 and were armed with a camera at all times. Hm.  Today, I got my eyebrows threaded in Edison, land of the samosa and home of my peops. I bought Versace Woman, a fine fragrance indeed. I also bought five phone cards which translates into roughly 12 hours of talk time with Patrycja in Poland. When my parents got back from Costco they brought with them a giant bag of shelled  Almonds . Hm. Yes, almonds. They are good, and they are salty. Hm.   Almond story: Friday the 13th of this month m0’lin0, -gmg-, et al. and I went to the Court Tavern to watch HIV Plus. Needless to say alcohol was bountiful, and we took full advantage, HIV Plus was in turn enjoyable, or was it because –gmg- kept posing the question “Slap my ass?” Okay, he wasn’t asking, he beseeched. But I digress, we went to Kings for pizza and I desired two slices of pepperoni. The entire walk to Kings, and the wait on line was brimming with a variety of axioms unique to a one –gmg-, naturally, these comments involved nuts. So he kept on saying “how ‘bout dese nuts” over and over again. Talk came to almonds, so when the gentleman behind the counter asked me what I wanted, I proudly asked for two slices of almond. But I hadn’t realized what I had said until I saw a disturbed look from the gentleman behind the counter, and –gmg- was stunned, wholly, he hasn’t quite recovered to date. So… how 'bout dese nuts, y0?    After Kings that night I met a guy who turns out to be the brother of my high school gym teacher. Weird.   My mother is frying fish, which means I will have to thoroughly detoxify the house as well as my wardrobe tomorrow. I do not understand, she said once we got an outdoor stove she would use that. We JUST bought a bbq grill with a stove… so should this not be the end of our smelling like burned masala? When I was young I resented the fact that I was Indian, my sister and I grew up absolutely loathing that aspect of us and wishing we were in a skin but our own. Once, someone in my sisters high school commented that she smelled like bbq. And I got a slue of curry comments (alliteration, yippie), but it wasn’t curry, it was masala [yes, they are entirely different]. Now, I accept that part of me without prejudice; yet, it pisses me off like… smelling of burnt masala.  I have excess energy to expend, it’s raining, so I don’t want to go running…. I’m frustrated and can’t concentrate on reading. Gandalf at this point would say something wise and insightful to relieve me of my woe’s. I’m so bored.

      ....argentina has gone to town, over the death of an actress called eva peron....  and that was the music playing as michael molino was building my fathers' new computer.  i just don't understand his (my fathers') rationale... this was a  good idea?   to read more check out  urlLink molino's blog .   in other news, friday night fine young cannibal's molino, gmg and i (along with a slue of other mediumites) went to the court tavern to check out matt madieros's band "HIV Plus"... i some how evaded the $8 cover charge which my fellow friends (chumps) paid.  actually, i think the doorman was consumed by the mosh pit.  i didn't even know the court had a downstairs!  saturday was pretty damn awesome, after mo' dealt with my father some more we headed for the rush show.  i've never been a fan of rush, but they really did put on an awesome show!  i never quite realized that they were talented... yes.  we got completely soaked and drunk, and molino sported the rush straw cowboy hat, which gave off quite an odor the next day.. wet hay!  what do you expect!  after the show molino was hungry, and that was my first excursion to your local friendly white castle.  it was also my last.  i've never eaten such  substance  of pathetic culinary design.  it was terrible!!  i was so thirsty that i washed it down with one of -gmg-'s  iso-pur  beverages.  the next day he shook his head and reminded me of what i had forgotten, this fine beverage ( iso-pur ) contains 40 g. of protein.  was that really necessary?  between white castle and the liquid meat i was not happy.  molino spent the day at my house again on sunday, he impressed me with his willingness to try new foods.  quite daring that molino!  yes, yes, it does taste while you can.   today (monday) was a completely wasted day.  i'm about to cry with how slow my internet connection is.  i wish my father would just let me get cable... or better yet, i need a salaried job and i'll get the damn internet connection.  right now $80/month is  a bit steep, i've already got car, insurance and phone and absence of job.  last friday marked the end of my temp job.  they're already looking for when my supervisor will be going on vacation so they can have me back.  it's not so much that i'm  that good , it's just that there are a lot of people out there that cannot grasp simple concepts, like this one guy who could never figure out which phone line was on hold as opposed to which one wasn't, EVEN when there was only one line to choose from.  oy and vei.   yesterday was karen's birthday, happy birthday my beautiful thelmski!
