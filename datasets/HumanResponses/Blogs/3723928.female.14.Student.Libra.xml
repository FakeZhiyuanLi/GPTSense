       hey ally. i think i know who that is. *wink wink*. liking you is something positive in my summer. talking to you is nice. seeing you is better. thinking about you is painful because i wanna be with you. you're truly beautiful and those 3 special words are serious. you should really think about you. call me ASAP ok? see yah. -John   John-    I know you were expecting me to say something last night when i called you after reading that. And you don't know how much that comment meant to me...But it left me speechless. Hun, I really do like you A LOT. And after thinking for a day I know what I wish I could have said...     John...I really do care about you a lot. And liking you is something i never thought i would feel, but its also something that I'm happy for this summer. When i talk to you, its like nothing i have ever dreamt of before. Your voice is just so...sexy. I would stay on the phone all day just to hear your voice, and even with our awkward silences just hearing you breathe puts a smile on my face. Your always on my mind, and in my dreams when I go to sleep. And when you asked what reminded me of you, I just wanted to say everything. Everywhere I go, Every song I listen to, Everything I do...It makes me think of you. I can't stop thinking about you. Being with you is so awesome. When we went out on Friday, I never wanted that night to end. And I wish that we could be together even more because every minute away from you is torture. And I really do care about you a lot & I don't want to lose you ever. And after thinking, I do realize that those 3 words are serious, and I guess I don't feel that way yet. Its just that what you do to me is so...Indescribable...and a simple crush just doesn't do it. I know its more then a little crush but love IS rushing it. But I just really really like you a lot. Your so perfect to me. Every little thing about you. I wouldn't change anything about you. I hope that we can get to know each other even more.

      Dear John,       Hi. I don't know what to say to you. I want to tell you how I feel, and that I really truely do like you a lot and when you hugged me on friday in jungle fun, you don't know what that felt like to me. It was like I had heaven in my arms, like nothing else mattered in the world except for me & you. I'm seriously falling for you & I don't know if what you told me was lies just to lead me on to see if I would fall for you or not or if they were true & you really did mean what you said. I'm sorry for being quiet, and for not being who I am. When I was with you I was so nervous & shy because I was afraid of what you might think of me if I was myself. You don't know how badly I wanted to kiss you and spend more time with you that night. I didn't ever want it to end. And if I could go back in time and stay in one moment forever it would have been that night. I want to be who you want me to be but its so hard. But I promise you that if you give me one more chance I know I can change, and I know I can treat you like how you should be treated. I think I might love you John. You mean so much to me & your the only guy thats ever seemed so effen perfect to me ever since the first time I saw you. Your everything I've ever wanted in a guy, your smart, and sweet, you smell awsome & your personality is so perfect. Your not too loud & obnoxius, and your so easy to talk to. Your so effen handsome & just the right height.I just wish that I could open up to you...let you into my heart. I guess I'm just afraid that if I do let you in you'll just use me & leave me heartbroken & bruised in the end. One more chance is all that I want...just to prove to you that I  CAN  be who you want me to be, I can be your perfect girl...I love you. I can't stop thinking about you. Your always in my dreams, and where ever I go I always want you near. Can you hear me when I scream your name at night? Can you feel my arms around you when I squeeze my pillow tight imagineing its you I'm holding? Do you hear me when I whisper "I love you" after you hang up the phone? Do I ever cross your mind? Have you ever dreamt about me & woken up to find yourself squeezing your pillow tight? I don't know what to do, what to say, when your holding me in your arms...You leave me in a bliss. And I love that about you. If only you knew you meant this much to me.   I will always love you, Ally
