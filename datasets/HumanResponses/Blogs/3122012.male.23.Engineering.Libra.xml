      Whenever you do something, friends, relatives, and absolutely unrelated people will definitely comment on it. They might appreciate you , but sometimes they will mock you.   Never change your decisions just because of what others say.    Because whatever they might say, they are not in the situation you are. And you are the best judge of yourself, your capabilities and results of things that you do. I am not saying that you dont listen to what others say. No. Definitely take opinions of others and as often as you can. What I am saying is that you should never give undue credit to mockery and bantering.

      It's a nice idea to brush your teeth, You see...you'll feel kinda Queazy if you dont. Your father here...well...wasnt much of a regular bather, but then ... he never missed brushing his teeth before eating anything !

      There's a phrase that goes like this "I'm an 'open book' ", meaning that everything that is there to know about you, is known.  My suggestion is , thats not a good idea. There ought to be somethings that are not meant for others to know. Keep some of your thoughts to yourself. Keep your opinions to yourself, and try to speak them out after some thought, or mebbe, after a lot of thought.  What I am doing here is exactly opposite of that , giving out my 'secrets of life'. But my suggestion is , DONT DO IT. Its not a nice idea for people to know about your 'fundamentals'. You become easily judgable, predictable. I dont like being predictable. I'd rather let people guess what I am upto and have no bloody idea about what I am thinking.Wierd. Aint it ?  But experience counts, and from my 23 years experience, thats my suggestion, take it or leave it.

      A lot many times do I think about what success is. Is it being on top? Being/Competiting with the best? I think success is not necessarily being on the top. I believe success is being happy with what you are doing. Success is being satisfied with yourself and achieving your cherished goals. Then, even if you are not at the top, you are happy with yourself and that is what success is.  Note: When I started writing, I had a different idea about what I'd write, but as I wrote, Ideas changed and moulded into a new shape, of what I have written. Guess thats whats true.
