       HIGHLIGHTS    e-Business – Asean    urlLink  Piecing together a Chinese software giant    Hong Kong-based chinadotcom, considered a "pioneer of China’s Internet," is reinventing itself as a provider of enterprise software to Chinese manufacturers. The company rose to prominence as a major player in the Chinese Internet portal market, but has now embarked on a series of acquisitions and partnership agreements in the USA, Canada and India to beef up its presence in the enterprise software market. Also on tap: plans to turn the company into a "software outsourcing shop." While most tech analysts are bullish on the company’s prospects, the article points out that chinadotcom "will face plenty of competition" from enterprise software rivals in China such as SAP and Oracle.

According to Sun, Wal-Mart suppliers will be able to load pallets of actual products in their original packaging and "run them through mock-ups of loading docks," enabling them to test whether RFID-tagged products can be read by Wal-Mart systems. Three other tech firms - Nortel Networks, Texas Instruments and i2 - will join Sun Microsystems in the RFID initiative. If all goes according to plan, Sun will open a similar RFID facility in Scotland by the end of the summer.

The company did disclose the exact size of the layoffs, noting only that less than 10% of the workforce would be affected. SCO also noted that the move to shore up financial performance was not the result of pressure applied by BayStar Capital, which earlier threatened to pull its $20 million investment. In its most recent quarter, SCO posted a net loss of $2.25 million on revenue of $11.4 million.

In addition, Sony Connect will offer full album downloads starting at $9.99. Sony - like its competitor Apple iTunes - hopes that its online music service will lead to additional sales of its audio devices. But, as critics point out, the company’s late start in the market may be difficult or impossible to overcome: "They're behind the curve already and they have to play catch-up on two fronts, on selling their audio players and getting people to use their music service. There's roughly three to four million people that have already placed that bet."

The disruptive power of the Internet means, "big companies are again under assault" in a number of very different industries. As during the late 1990s, the Internet is "threatening to force down the prices charged by traditional players, squeeze their margins, and even put some out of business. New technology, new ways of doing business and new approaches to cutting out the middleman mean the old pricing power is collapsing in a series of industries…" Business Week trains its eye on six industries that are about to be disrupted: jewelry, bill payments, telecom, hotels, real estate, and software. While nobody is claiming that this is "1996 redux," the fact remains that the online players that survived the brutal Internet shakeout are stronger, savvier and leaner than their boomtown brethren.

According to one social networking expert at the conference, the Howard Dean campaign has been a key catalyst: "We'll look back and see (the Howard Dean presidential campaign) as the beginning of the change." The key, say political activists, is to understand the "traditional ways campaign work" - and then use new Internet-based tools to counteract these tactics.

He says it was time well spent. "India has the potential to be one of the largest pension markets in the world," said Sachdev, managing director of Principal Mutual Fund, the Indian subsidiary of Principal Financial Group, the biggest provider of retirement plans to U.S. companies. After more than a decade of debate, the Indian government this year plans to license private fund managers to invest the savings of India's 400 million public and private workers - about 90 percent of whom have no retirement security, according to a government-commissioned report. Principal, ING Groep, Merrill Lynch, Aviva and about 20 other asset managers are vying for access to a market that India's Finance Ministry forecasts will be worth $100 billion within a decade. The number of licenses has not been decided.  "The pension business in India has the potential to grow up to $350 billion during the lifetime of a generation," said Yvo Metzelaar, managing director and chief executive of the Bangalore- based ING Vysya Life Insurance, a subsidiary of the largest Dutch financial services company. "Pensions have become a top priority for us."  Metzelaar has concerns, too.  India has no social benefits system and most workers earn less than $1,000 a year, meaning they will struggle to build pension assets.  "The presence of a social security system in India is very important for a thriving pension system," Metzelaar said. "A social security system provided by the government will cover the basic minimum level of pensions these people need."  The pension process is unlikely to be straightforward in any case. Last year, the Indian government set up an interim Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority to frame rules that will be enforced by a new, independent authority. Parliament must still approve that new watchdog - a move that is on hold until after a five-phase general election ends on Monday.  License applicants may face further delays because the current pension plan does not provide any government guarantee, said Mukesh Anand, an economist at the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.  The Finance Ministry says details about the number of pension licenses, the method by which they will be awarded and rules governing both funds and contributors will be published by the end of the year.  License holders then must overcome the challenges of distribution in a country with 1 billion people.  Uncertainties have not cooled the enthusiasm of companies. Indians, about half of whom are under 25, deposit $78 billion a year into fixed and savings accounts in commercial banks, according to a government survey. Their savings make up 14 percent of the economy.  "The challenge is to channel these savings into long-term investments to finance infrastructure that India needs," said Sachdev at Principal. "That's where pension fund companies come in."  HSBC Holdings, ABN AMRO Holding and Deutsche Bank are among banks to set up asset management companies during the past three years in anticipation of pension reform.  Insurers such as American International Group, the Munich-based Allianz and Standard Life Assurance, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, have established joint ventures with Indian partners in line with a rule limiting foreign investment for insurers to 26 percent.  "When we entered the insurance business in India, the understanding was that the pensions market would also be opened up," said Stuart Purdy, chief executive of the New Delhi-based Aviva Life Insurance, a subsidiary of Aviva, Britain's largest insurer by premiums.  Aviva, which started selling Indians life insurance in 2002, will apply for a pension license. "It's such an under-provisioned market and the savings rate is huge," Purdy said.  The prize license will cover India's 3.2 million federal government workers. Since Jan. 1, about 50,000 new employees a year have had to contribute 10 percent of their wages to a fund still to be set up.  The government is matching that contribution, with all funds held by India's controller-general of accounts until licenses are awarded.  Previously, the government paid all contributions for its current workers and 7 million retirees, or their surviving dependents, from its revenue. Its pension bill quadrupled to $3.5 billion in the decade to March 31, 2003, Finance Ministry figures show, or 3.2 percent of total spending.  "Reforms are overdue - people are living longer and they need security," said K. C. Mishra, director of the National Insurance Institute. "The government's own pensions bill is becoming unmanageable."  Whoever wins the government-fund license also will have access to voluntary contributions by about 350 million self-employed workers and seasonal contractors, from rickshaw drivers to doctors.  Workers in India's 28 state governments and its state-run companies, such as Indian Railways, the world's biggest employer with 1.5 million workers, are expected to join as well.  "The numbers will grow," said Mukul Asher, a public policy professor at the National University of Singapore who advised the Indian government on pension changes. "Overseas investors are right to get excited."

With only six months until the presidential election, no policy is in place to govern the development and supervision of e-voting machines, reports the piece, and "the federal research intended as the basis of the standards has not been financed, much less begun." Most pressing is the widespread desire for e-voting machines to leave a paper trail due to security concerns.

       HIGHLIGHTS   IT – Software Tech    urlLink Citrix tests Web conferencing service    Citrix Online hopes to build on its popular GoToMyPC service for remote computer access with a new Web conferencing program.    The company, a division of networking software seller Citrix Systems, plans to begin offering a free preview version of GoToMeeting on Monday. The service enables customers to present PowerPoint slides, run applications and handle basic collaboration tasks over the Web.   The service will compete in an increasingly crowded market dominated by Web conferencing specialist WebEx. The niche has drawn attention from major software makers such as Microsoft and Macromedia.   Citrix Online will distinguish its service partly through simplicity, said Klaus Schauser, chief technical officer for the Santa Barbara, Calif., and company. Instead of loading the service up with complex interactivity and polling features, GoToMeeting will focus on what actually happens in meetings: talking and looking at PowerPoint slides.   "We're focusing on everyday meetings--this is not a Webinar product; this is not a training product," Schauser said, making the comparison with online seminar products. "Our motto has always been that 'simpler is better,' even though there are some pretty sophisticated capabilities in the product. We can very quickly go from something that's presentation-only to something that's more interactive."   The simplicity goal will also extend to pricing. Citrix Online will charge a flat monthly fee based on the number of simultaneous users, rather than the per-minute pricing typical of the market.   Matt Reid, a senior vice president for product marketing at Citrix Online, said the goal is to make online meetings an everyday choice to improve productivity and cut down on travel and other expenses.   "People like the technology around Web conferencing--they just aren't using it as much as they could," Reid said. "And the product needs to actually get used to generate the savings. That's why we really want to make sure it's affordable for the masses to use."   The paid version of GoToMeeting is set to launch in July. The basic service will cost $49 per month, or $468 per year.   Citrix Online is mainly known for GoToMyPC, a product it acquired from specialist Expertcity that allows any PC to be accessed remotely over the Web.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell says it would "dramatically increase" the availability and quality of wireless Internet connections - especially for people in rural areas. Powell says it would be like "doubling the number of lanes on a congested highway."   But TV broadcasters oppose the proposal. They argue that it would interfere with over-the-air television signals for millions of people. The FCC commissioners voted unanimously to begin the lengthy rulemaking process for the plan.

By the end of April 2004 wireless penetration in Russia had reached 30.8 percent, taking the total to 44.7 million subscribers, according to analysts at Moscow-based J'son & Partners. With GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) technology dominating 95 percent of the market’s current cellular services, Russia is expected to adopt the European W-CDMA standard as its 3G technology of choice. The W-CDMA air interface is part of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Standard (UMTS). Used with existing GSM core networks, the theory goes, W-CDMA-compliant handsets and base stations can increase wireless data transfer rates to a potential maximum of 2 Mbit/s. In its latest report, J'Son & Partners states that Russian carriers have conducted extensive trials of W-CDMA networks over the past three years. Mobile TeleSystems OJSC (MTS) the country’s largest carrier (16.1 million subscribers), has trialed kit from NEC Corp.; Tokyo: 6701), Siemens AG; and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Number two, JSC Vimpel-Communications (VimpelCom) (13.9 million) has tested equipment from Alcatel SA; Third-place MegaFon (8.1 million subscribers) is testing kit from LM Ericsson NEC, Nokia Corp. and Siemens. J’Son claims that 3G licenses are likely to be awarded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with network deployment slated for the second or third quarter of 2005. Commercial 3G-service launch “in major Russian cities” is expected in the first and second quarters of 2006. The Russian 3G market has a great potential to develop through a combination of positive circumstances. The government has a key role... by limiting the influence of market inhibitors and ensuring success through a timely and intelligent development of 3G. The attraction of Russia’s cellular industry has already led a number of Europe’s Tier 1 carriers to take significant stakes in the market’s three main players. T-Mobile International AG has a 25 percent stake in MTS, and Telenor ASA, which is keen to build a growing presence in the region, holds a 29 percent stake in VimpelCom. Scandinavian powerhouse TeliaSonera AB that is also amassing mobile assets in Northern and Eastern Europe owns 43.8 percent of MegaFon. Vodafone Group plc is also rumoured to be making a move on the market following its failed bid to take over AT&T Wireless Services Inc. (NYSE: AWE - message board).  Strategically, Russia is a very important market for carriers, there is the potential for huge growth, and many global carriers will be gauging the opportunity for 3G. The fact that licenses are set for award in the next twelve months is another reason why Vodafone may be eyeing up the market.

       HIGHLIGHTS   INTERNET – ENGINE SEARCH   Google Desktop Search Tool Rumored & Software Principles Released   The New York Times is reporting that Google plans to release a desktop search tool in the near future. The rumor comes on the heels of a new "Software Principles" page the company posted yesterday.  Google already has a desktop presence in the form of its long-standing Google Toolbar and the Google Deskbar search applet released last year. But a full-blown desktop searching application is seen by some as a move Microsoft might make to lock-in users. The Google project appears designed to counter this threat, according to the report. Among the major search engines, AltaVista offered its AltaVista Discovery desktop search tool back in 1998, but it was never widely used. More recently, Lycos introduced a desktop search tool in March. Coincidental with the rumor - or perhaps not - Google released a new Software Principles page yesterday. It's a call to the software industry to be more transparent and clear with users about what exactly their applications will do. Among the principles, Google suggests that software should  · 	Not trick people into installing it   · 	Provide clear disclosure of its functions   · 	Be easy to remove   · 	Be clear in responsibility for when it changes default behaviors   · 	Be upfront about personal data and other information gathered   · 	Not be bundled with other software that doesn't follow principles of good behavior  In other news, the Google Gmail email system that sparked amazement by offering 1 gigabyte of storage space in April appears to have increased that amount by 1,000 times to 1 terabyte, for some users. Aaron Schwartz and Dave Winer are just to reporting this has happened to them. Checking my own Gmail account, I don't see this happening. Gmail still tells me that I have 1000 MB of space in total, with 17 percent of it currently used. Personally, I suspect a bug. Google's move came after Lycos recently offered 1 GB of space to its email users and Yahoo declared it would greatly increase the free space offered to those using its email service.

In order to help the spread of the use of this new service, the bank also announced its intention to help the costumers to purchase 3G handsets with special prices and credit conditions. The first available service will be based on the BES Internet Banking on the I9 TMN Portal. It will be possible to check accounts, transfer funds, and recharge mobile accounts.

This has led to a developed new science in the last few years, SEM (Search Engine Marketing). This new science, SEM, has been a boon to both Web Masters and the merchants that maintain Web sites as a way to increase exposure and revenue for their products and/or services. SEM has become a much sought after entity, with SEM specialists, who focus on optimization of a site, routinely adding linking campaign management to their overall repertoire of services. This has resulted in a large influx of Web sites focusing on linking campaigns and reciprocal linking as it has been established that good, solid reciprocal linking campaigns increased traffic and visitors to a site exponentially.  However, like with everything else online, the idea of SEM and linking campaigns has spread like "wildfire", with sites seeking links seemingly endlessly. This has led to what can only be termed, "linking explosions", with many sites posting links to everything and anything in an effort to increase their Search Engine rankings and placements.  The actual attainment of effective linking campaigns, is a work oriented, tedious undertaking, with literally months spent developing a good campaign. While a good linking campaign does increase rankings overall, with the Search Engines, the question remains, "does it increase sales"? After all, consumers are the ingredient that facilitates the sale of a product/service in the long run, not the rankings or placement of a site. Questions about whether linking campaigns increase revenue for a site are coming into play now.  Recent data has shown that consumers, now more than ever, are arriving at Web sites via "search features", not by direction to a Web site via another Web site link. The use of "search features" to arrive at a site has increased by almost six percent in the past year. In addition, direct navigation by visitors to a Web site, has also increased from a year ago, by almost ten percent. In direct contrast, Web link "arrivals" of visitors has dropped in the past year, by a somewhat staggering, twenty percent!  The World Wide Web quite obviously has now become more utilitarian to consumers, and linking campaigns, as a result, may become more ineffective as time goes on. Linking campaigns, by their very nature, promote "browsing" and the consumer finds time-consuming “visiting” of many sites, before the product/item/service. As the Web progresses and consumers become increasingly discerning in their overall approach to the Web, they are now going right to the source, more often, via "search features" and direct navigation.  Accordingly, then, the "digging around" on other sites, has diminished over the past twelve months, and in all likelihood, will continue as a trend well into the future, hampering the effectiveness of linking campaigns overall. This trend reflects an international shift towards this method of finding information on the Web, and is not localized whatsoever, crossing many demographic and geographic barriers.  It's really difficult to effectively pinpoint the cause in this shift for consumers. However, the sheer magnitude of the linking campaign craze that is so prominent now, may account, at least in part, for the shift in the attitudes of consumers. Because of the popularity of linking campaigns as a method of increasing rankings and placement, attaining "quality" links (those with a Page Rank of 5 or higher) has become more difficult for Web masters. In addition, the sheer volume of linking requests to pages with a high ranking, has also increased, to the point where higher ranked Web sites are inundated daily with linking requests, interfering with their ability to attend to their own business.  Web masters have now oftentimes taken to using any links whatsoever; as long as the links added have the appropriate Page Rank. Little thought seems to be given at times, to the theme of a links page or the relevance of links that have been added, leaving visitors to some sites confused and frustrated. This will in all probability lead consumers to turn to the Search Engines and direct navigation even more in the future, not less.  This could have dire consequences for many Web sites down the road, as those at the bottom of search listings could conceivably be forced out of business.  There are methods however that can aid in the retention of top rankings and listings with the Search Engines, in and above linking campaigns.    These methods would also hold greater appeal for consumers in general, as they would add quality to a Web site, as well as content, something that will add "longevity of appeal" to a Web site:   1.  The writing of good, content oriented copy, which imparts value to a Web site. Good copy has always been utilized to establish good overall traffic and conversion patterns. Even Search Engines seem to understand this and routinely rank Web sites with good pertinent content, higher than other Web sites.  2.  The placement of ads on high traffic sites. Just one good ad, placed on another Web site with good overall traffic, will significantly increase rankings and placement by the Search Engines.   3.  The submitting of a Web site to all possible, pertinent directories. Directories were always a good method of increasing rankings and placement, and they still, to this day, are a good choice.   4.  The optimization of all other aspects of a Web site, from the meta-tags to the design. Meta-tag optimization, like directory listings, continues to be a good overall optimization technique. The design of a Web site can also enhance rankings and placement, as the site needs to be "readable" to the Search Engines, and some flash and other enhancements, can prevent "readability", thus hampering rankings and placement.   5.  The enhancement of traffic by offline marketing campaigns. This is one facet of Web site traffic management that many individuals neglect, but that can successfully increase rankings significantly.   6.  The use of PPC (Pay Per Click) campaigns. While these can be expensive, if care is not given to the bidding, they can also enhance traffic to a Web site, as "traffic begets more traffic", establishing a ranking pattern for the Search Engines.   7.  The addition of keywords that are relevant to a site, throughout the copy, the title, and the meta-tags and any other text, such as articles and reports. Keywords are the "guides" that the Search Engines use to find a site and rank it. The addition of good relevant keywords always enhances rankings and placement. Linking campaigns, as you can see, while having their overall place in effective rankings and placement within the Search Engines, are not the "be all and end all" of optimization or rankings. Many various fundamentally sound methods of optimization still exist, and should be utilized in any well-rounded Search Engine Marketing campaign.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  INTERNET – WEB PORTALS   Search Engines & Web Portals Going 1GB Email Crazy    Making news yesterday, Lycos Europe introed a paid 1GB email service which beat the slow paced Google GMaillaunch.   However, GMail’s functionality may make it stand out to users and web emailers more so than its added storage size. Besides, other established mail servers have already or are starting to offer 1GB mail accounts. Here’s a comparison of search related email account offerings from Pras at Cinematic Rain Yahoo! Mail: - Upgraded their free accounts to 100MB 1GB mail coming soon  Lycos Mail: - 1GB available for about $6 a month Google GMail: - Still in beta testing - No news of when it will officially be launched to the public SpyMac: - 1GB email accounts - 350MB combined storage   The “All-You-Can-Eat Buffet” Effect  Finally the mailbox providers are realizing its not about how much storage people are really going to use, but instead of actually offering a whole lot of space. Its like a buffet, you offer tons of food and unlimited servings. But out of the potential diners, only a few will gorge themselves till they’re racing to the restroom. All that aside, one must ask, where is Hotmail nowadays? Are they happy to be stuck with 2-4MB storage? What does MSN have up their sleeve, if anything? Yahoo and Hotmail don’t change their ways, their advertising cluttered email pages will send mass pilgrimages over to Google GMail and other similar offerings, about two of the best-known e-mail services, MSN Hotmail and Yahoo Mail (my least favorites), I visualize their ad-laden, cluttered screens.  GMail knocks Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail hard. Speed is extra ordinary. It simply is too fast that you fear if it’s indeed a secure service.” Mittal adds his opinion on GMail’s controversial email content targeted Google Adwords advertising, I did not see many ads. In fact most pages did not have any. One big mail with some good content showed the adsense ads, which are creating furors in the market. They are not intrusive, irritating. They just are present at one side. It’s not something that’s in your face. And that is something wonderful. Compare that to Yahoo’s big flash ads and Microsoft’s heavy pages. Just when things were starting to heat up in the big search engine version of King of the Hill, Google came out with their 1GB GMail, stirring the pot and starting a new battle trying to get registered mail users to their search friendly email systems. It should be interesting to see how MSN, Yahoo and others fully respond.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

       HIGHLIGHTS    TELECOMUNICATIONS – WIFI   T-Mobile, Hyatt ink hotspot deal   T-Mobile signed a deal with Hyatt Hotels & Resorts to launch WiFi hotspots in nearly all of Hyatt's 200 hotels by mid-2005.   The companies have already launched service at the Hyatt in Charlotte, North Carolina, with plans to launch service in the Hyatt Regency at Chicago's O'Hare airport next week. Hyatt aims to have wireless access in nearly all of its hotels and in most of its hotel rooms. Access will be available for $9.99 per day for guests who do not subscribe to T-Mobile's nationwide hotspot service. This deal is T-Mobile's first major hotspot contract with a hotel franchise. No financial details of the deal were released. The deal is a coup for T-Mobile, which beat out hotspot rival Wayport for one of the last remaining nationwide hotel WiFi contracts. Wayport dominates the paid-access WiFi sector for hotels. Wayport has recently emerged as the defining player in the paid-access hotspot market thanks to the company's growing hotel network and its recent nationwide hotspot deal with McDonald's. Meanwhile, most investors and financial analysts are down on the paid access hotspot business model. This market pessimism has grown worse since hotspot service provider Cometa Networks closed its doors last month.

ARC Senior Analyst Rupert Reid, takes a quick look at recent developments in the mobile video space to ee how they measure up against ARC Group's forecasts and whether there is any substance behind the hype. As the latest in a line of applications touted to turn around flagging ARPUs and kick-start the dawn of a new mobile multimedia era, mobile video has been much in the spotlight recently. Whereas the adoption and usage levels of 3's much publicised video telephony services have not exactly set the industry alight in the early days of its launch, the underlying trends nevertheless point to a steady ramping up of interest in mobile video.  In the last 6 months, a flurry of activity across all elements of the value chain has witnessed the increasing momentum behind bringing mobile video applications and enabling technologies to market as players from platform vendors to content aggregators all attempt to carve an early lead in this nascent market. Recent deals between Vodafone and Warner Bros. Entertainment, Mobilkom Austria and CNN and 3 Sweden and Endemol/Kanal highlight the growing focus placed on strategic partnerships between operators and content owners to target mobile video streaming, downloading and messaging services. By building up a rich ecosystem of branded content, 3G operators are clearly positioning their networks primarily as video-capable, and heavily promoting video streaming and video telephony services as a differentiator from 2.5G networks.  It is not just the 3G operators however who are pioneering video services as a number of 2.5G operators have launched video services of their own. For example, a number of European operators including Telefonica, TIM and O2 have launched a range of early video streaming applications through partnership with RealNetworks and its Helix Universal Platform. Likewise, the indications from Sprint PCS are very encouraging with PCS Vision customers having sent more than 100m picture messaging images and 15-second video messaging clips since November 2002.  Despite these promising early trends, there are challenges at every point in the mobile video value chain, which must be resolved before video takes off on a mass-market basis:  - 	Reducing the price of video-supporting handsets to gain mass  market acceptance  - 	Developing viable business models for video distribution which include content protection,   - 	Resolving the interoperability, interconnect and roaming  issues for such services.   Top of these challenges remains the perennial problem of video-capable handset availability and a lack of well-defined and established standards across the value chain which are essential for operators to build a full service that includes content, servers, applications and handsets.   Nonetheless, ARC is confident that ongoing developments in high-performance, low-power multimedia application processors coupled with continuing improvements in high-resolution CMOS image sensors and high-resolution colour LCD screens, will see the mass market penetration of video-enabled handsets by 2006. As with any forecast, the purchasing behaviour of end-users remains the key variable in assessing demand and also the hardest to predict. Nevertheless, on the balance of evidence, ARC believes that the widespread availability of video-capable terminals together with high-bandwidth networks supported by a rich distribution network of branded and mobile specific content will result in a steadily growing market for mobile video services over the next 5 years.   Mobile Video, from the ARC Group, forecasts that between 2003 and 2005 there will be a relatively slow rate of adoption, as the market is in its launch phase although from 2005 onwards strong growth is anticipated, and by 2008 it is forecast that close to 250m consumers will use mobile video services. Mobile Video also predicts that video messaging will remain the biggest application category throughout the forecast period. In 2003, the figure of 5.1m users is mainly made up of the video clip messaging services that have been launched by operators in Japan. In Europe, initial video services have also been focused mostly on video messages, since user-generated content frees the operator from dealing with content copyright issues and content owners' DRM requirements. As MMS starts to enter the mainstream in Europe, it is expected that as camera phones in the European market evolve to support video, there will be a high adoption rate for video messaging services as an enhancement to regular MMS.   Video download is expected to be second to video messaging in terms of users until 2005, when video streaming will take over second spot, based on the higher penetration of 3G networks. After 2003, streaming will be a preferred method of consuming video content, since it has a much more immediate viewing experience than video download, and enables longer video clips and also live TV-like live broadcast services. As a strictly a 3G service, ARC expect the total number of video telephony users to increase from 1.3 m in 2003 to almost 90m in 2008. Video telephony will continue to differentiate 3G networks from 2.5G networks, and the popularity of this application will rise as more possibilities become available to connect via video calling to enterprise video conferencing systems and consumer video devices in the broadband-connected home. This network effect of home, office and mobile video telephony devices will cause mobile video telephony to overtake video download services by 2007.

But Alvarion used this week's Wireless Communications Association conference in Washington, D.C. to roll out equipment that it says can be easily upgraded to support the emerging standard. Alvarion already makes its own proprietary wireless broadband infrastructure, which it sells to carriers that want to provide high-speed Internet access over long distances. The BreezeMax product line introduced Wednesday, based on an Alvarion chip, includes wireless base stations that later will be able to serve WiMax CPE (customer premises equipment). All that carriers will need in order to support the new CPE is a firmware upgrade, according to Patrick Leary, assistant vice president of marketing at Alvarion, which is based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Vendors including Alvarion and Intel are counting on high-volume production of WiMax silicon to drive down the price of customer gear and make wireless broadband a profitable carrier service. WiMax is designed to deliver data speeds comparable to cable modem and DSL services over a distance of as much as 30 miles. The WiMax Forum industry group expects to begin certifying WiMax products by the end of this year.   Changing the Channel  The group is working toward specifications for three pieces of radio spectrum, around 2.5 GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 5 GHz, Leary says. Alvarion's platform introduced Wednesday, the BreezeMax 3500, will use the 3.5-GHz band. Once an Intel chip set that supports WiMax in the 3.5-GHz band is commercially available it will be integrated into new, standardized versions of Alvarion's CPE and its base stations, he says. Leary expects the chip set to ship around the middle of next year. That standardized, high-volume silicon should drive down costs significantly, Leary says.  The BreezeMax 3500 line will include "macro" base stations for dense urban areas and "micro" base stations for rural deployments, along with three kinds of CPE. One CPE device is for IP data only, one supports both data and voice over IP, and one has an integrated 802.11g wireless LAN access point for wireless hotspots or small businesses. For the CPE, Alvarion will charge carriers between $200 and $500 depending on volume, capacity and configuration. The micro base stations will range from $10,000 to $15,000 and the macro versions from $50,000 to $60,000. Though much attention has been focused on the licensed 2.5-GHz and unlicensed 5-GHz bands, Alvarion is aiming at the initial sweet spot with a 3.5-GHz product, according to Leary. That band has already been licensed for wireless carrier services in many countries outside North America, he says. The 3.5-GHz BreezeMax products have been in trials at carriers in Europe and Asia.  The 3.5-GHz band is "the most stable environment in a regulatory sense, and it's where we believe mass deployment can be achieved most rapidly," Leary says. Yankee Group analyst Lindsay Schroth agrees. Outside the Western Hemisphere, many major carriers already hold spectrum in that range, she says. By contrast, WiMax deployment in the 2.5-GHz range probably will have to wait for decisions by two big U.S. carriers, Sprint and Nextel Communications, Schroth says. Unlicensed 5-GHz services probably will remain the realm of enterprises and small rural providers, she adds. "The U.S. market in general is kind of up in the air in terms of how quickly people will deploy stuff," Schroth says.

The company also said it has teamed with Hollywood director Scott Sanders to develop an online “advertainment” film promoting the phone.   “By finding innovative ways to showcase Motorola's dynamic phone technology, we are serving the consumer in two ways. First, we are highlighting the important benefits of the V710, which include seamless mobility, creative expression and personal freedom,” said Jason Few, vice president of marketing for Motorola. “Second, we are demonstrating the role technology plays in opening doors for the development of creative content and platforms in the arts. The V710 truly is the gold standard in mobile phones."   Motorola’s CDMA V710 features a 1.2-megapixel camera, video capture and playback, an MP3 player and 10 megabytes of internal memory. Motorola did not name a carrier to sell the phone, although Verizon Wireless in the past has said it is testing the device.   Under Motorola’s promotion with Sanders, the filmmaker wrote and directed a short film “starring” the V710, which is available at hellomoto.com/producer. Motorola said the cliffhanger ending to the film will be released online when the V710 becomes available this summer.   In other phone news, Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo Inc. released three new third-generation wireless phones, which feature 2-megapixel cameras and video capabilities.

After nearly a seven-year journey, Cassini is scheduled to enter orbit around Saturn at 10:30 p.m. EDT, June 30, 2004.   "The Saturn system represents an unsurpassed laboratory, where we can look for answers to many fundamental questions about the physics, chemistry, evolution of the planets and the conditions that give rise to life," said Dr. Ed Weiler, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science, Washington.  Cassini was launched Oct. 15, 1997 on a journey covering 3.5 billion kilometers (2.2 billion miles), Cassini is the most instrumented and scientifically capable planetary spacecraft ever flown. There are 12 instruments on the Cassini orbiter and six on the Huygens probe. The mission represents the best technical efforts of 260 scientists from the United States and 17 European nations. The Cassini mission cost approximately $3 billion.  The Cassini/Huygens mission is a four-year study of Saturn. The 18 highly sophisticated science instruments will study Saturn's rings, icy satellites, magnetosphere, and Titan, the planet's largest moon.  The spacecraft will fire its main engine for 96 minutes during the critical Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) maneuver. The maneuver will reduce Cassini's speed, so Saturn can capture it as an orbiting satellite. Cassini will pass through a gap between the planet's F and G rings, swing close to the planet, and begin the first of 76 orbits around Saturn's system. During the mission, it will have 52 close encounters with seven of Saturn's 31 moons.  There are risks involved with orbit insertion, but mission planners have prepared for them. There is a backup in case the main engine fails, and the path through the ring plane was searched for hazards with the best Earth and space-based telescopes. Particles too small to be seen from Earth could be fatal to the spacecraft, so Cassini will turn to use its high gain antenna as a shield against small objects.  Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun, and it is the second largest in the solar system, after Jupiter. Saturn and its ring system serve as a miniature model for the disc of gas and dust that surrounded the early sun, which formed the planets. Detailed knowledge of the dynamics of interactions among Saturn's elaborate rings and many different moons will provide valuable data for understanding how the solar system's planets evolved.  The study of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is one of the major goals of the mission. Titan may preserve, in deep-freeze, many of the chemical compounds that preceded life on Earth. Cassini will execute 45 flybys of Titan within approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) of the surface. This will permit high-resolution mapping of the moon with the Titan radar-imaging instrument. The radar can see through the opaque haze of Titan's upper atmosphere.   "Titan is like a time machine taking us to the past to see what Earth might have been like," said Dr. Dennis Matson, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif. "The hazy moon may hold clues to how the primitive Earth evolved into a life-bearing planet," he said.  On Dec. 24, 2004, Cassini will release the wok-shaped Huygens probe for its journey to Titan. Huygens is the first probe designed to descend to the surface of the moon of another planet, and the most distant descent of a robotic probe attempted on another object in the solar system. On Jan. 14, 2005, after a three-week ballistic freefall, Huygens will enter Titan's atmosphere. It will deploy parachutes and begin 2.5 hours of intensive scientific observations. The Huygens probe will transmit data to the Cassini spacecraft, which will relay the information back to Earth.  JPL designed, developed and assembled the Cassini orbiter. A team at the European Space Technology and Research Center in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, managed the development of the Huygens probe. The Italian Space Agency provided the high-gain antenna, much of the radio system and elements of several of Cassini's science instruments. JPL manages the overall program for NASA's Office of Space Science.

During his keynote speech at the Inbox e-mail technology conference, Eric Hahn, CEO of antispam firm Proofpoint, called on software developers to stop treating e-mail inboxes as places to dump memos and start thinking of them as control centers that combine e-mail, instant messaging, voicemail and other communications.   Gmail service features a similar option.  Advanced e-mail search is also gaining in popularity. The feature allows users to leave all their e-mails in a single folder, where individual messages can be found later using fast searches. Both Gmail and Stata Laboratories' Bloomba software now offer advanced search.  Still, it's unclear when more popular e-mail products will adopt similar features. Yahoo's antispam product manager Miles Libbey said his company is working on a summer face lift for its Yahoo Mail service, but he declined to say whether it would include any major interface changes.   He did say, however, that the upgrade would likely include the addition of some sort of indicator next to messages in the inbox that would let users know if their e-mails came from authenticated senders. Authenticating senders is a goal of Yahoo's DomainKeys antispam technology, which is currently in its testing phase. The indicator would make it easier for users to detect so-called phishing scams that some spammers send out in an attempt to trick people into revealing their personal information.   Speakers at the Inbox conference will continue to present more ideas for making e-mail more useful and manageable through Friday. Inbox is the first of two major e-mail-related conferences taking place this month. The second event, aptly named the Email Technology Conference, takes place June 16-18 in San Francisco.

       HIGHLIGHTS    BUSINESS – HEALTH CARE   Sales of Health and Beauty Products to Ethnic Men Surpass $1.4 Billion   Increased knowledge and acceptance of grooming practices by male consumers plays key role.   African American, Hispanic and Asian American men spend more than $1.4 billion on personal care items, including both general-use and ethnic-specific health and grooming products, by 2008, sales in the category are expected to climb to $1.7 billion, experiencing a healthy gain of nearly 20 percent.  Increased magazine and television coverage of men’s grooming issues, from the application of skin creams to proper shaving techniques, have helped grow sales in the ethnic male category and in the men’s grooming category overall. The estimates are currently 84 million African American, Asian, and Hispanic men in the United States.  Men in general tend to be overlooked in the personal care industry – and ethnic males are no exception. But the truth is that ethnic men present a lucrative audience to marketers, and, with the explosive growth of the Hispanic population, can offer opportunities in the overall men’s grooming industry, which of late has been stagnant.

The metaphor suggests that the software giant is facing a long and bitter struggle against irrational fanatics who are passionately anti-Microsoft.   But there was nothing extreme or irrational about the way in which Munich City Council this week calmly and democratically dealt Microsoft one of the biggest blows it has suffered in its short corporate history. After a year's trial, the City's burghers voted 50-29, in a closed door meeting, to migrate all of its 14,000 Microsoft based desktop computers over to Linux, the Open Office desktop suite, and the open source Mozilla browser.   The contract is not huge - with the initial training and implementation, it is believed to be worth less than €20million - but it is very high profile, with key suppliers on both sides viewing this a key battle in a long war. Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer famously broke off a skiing trip to travel to Munich and offer huge discounts if the City stuck with Microsoft, while IBM and Novell, owner of the Linux operating system supplier Suse, both gave thousands of hours of expertise to help run the pilot. (Even then, Munich admitted to Information Age in January 2004 that the trial had suffered "technical difficulties".)   The end of the trial now means that the contract to supply the systems will now be put out to tender – following the rigorous rules set out for public purchasing by the European Commission. HP, Dell and IBM are expected to be among the bidders.  Throughout Europe this year, a succession of public sector authorities have announced plans to migrate to Linux, but in most cases this has meant moving from Unix servers to Linux servers, often staying with the same hardware supplier. Very few organisations have migrated their desktops to Linux. Many of those evaluated Linux are worried about possible instability, the potential loss of key features in Microsoft's Office Suite, possible file incompatibilities, especially when exchanging documents with trading partners, a lack of skills, and staff resistance.   Microsoft executives dismissed the Munich decision, saying that there are peculiar factors involved and that IBM had helped to drive the decision. Even so, Microsoft is becoming worried – as its Roadshow demonstrates.   Analysts believe Munich is a crucial milestone that will accelerate adoption of Linux on the desktop. IDC has forecast that Linux desktop market share will grow from 3% to 6% from 2004 to 2007. Although Microsoft's share is currently a massive 95%, the loss of 3%-4% share amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars lost in Windows and Office licences. If that share were to fall faster, as Linux proponents believe is likely, then Microsoft would begin to suffer serious financial consequences.  Meanwhile, some journalists have been questioning Microsoft's marketing tactics, suggesting that the Roadshow shows "fear" that businesses will pick up on. But Microsoft believes that in a war like this, it has to take the offensive.

The engineer, Jason Smathers, 24, apparently used the identity of another AOL employee to gain access to the company's list of customer email addresses on a supposedly highly secure database. He also took their telephone numbers, postal codes and the type of credit card they use. Fortunately, credit card numbers are kept on a separate database.  He sold the information to the owner of an Internet gambling site, Sean Dunaway, 21, who wanted to spam the addresses to promote his site. Smathers is also said to have sold the list to others although no details have been disclosed.  The two men are the first to be prosecuted under the new US 'CAN-SPAM' law.

Ashraf Hasson and Hasanen Nawfal are both natives of Baghdad.  Like many 20-somethings, Hasson and Nawfal grew up nurturing passions for computers and for programming.  Both of them are firm believers in open source software. Unlike expensive proprietary software, open-source software can be freely distributed and modified, as long as the modifications are shared with other users.  They are particularly fans of Linux operating system.  These two Linux enthusiasts, though, did not even know one another before the ousting of Saddam Hussein.  But they found each other online, in a Linux forum hosted by Iraqi expatriates, soon after Saddam fell and started thinking about what they could do.  "Every country has a Linux users group except Iraq, so I thought, maybe Iraq deserves to have a Linux users group," said Ashraf Hasson.  "We started sending e-mails, and trying to figure out how to help Iraqi people here to know about Linux, educate them, spread the word. And so we did."    Cost savings   The Iraqi Linux User Group has now been up and running for a little more than a year.  "I wanted to find people to share knowledge with," explained Hasanen Nawfal, "to learn from them, to speak with guys who share my thoughts."  The Iraqi Linux User Group website lists more than 200 members, most of whom are Iraqi expatriates.  They are united in their belief that open-source software like Linux could help their nation.  Its chief advantage is that Linux code is free to use and modify.  To Nabil Suleiman, a member of the Iraqi Linux User Group living in Canada, Linux could mean significant cost savings.  "There is a shortage in power and water supplies, and sewage systems, so the last thing Iraq needs is spending billions of dollars on very expensive and overpriced products, especially software products," he said.  "We believe that Linux can save us lots of money in this field."    Illegal software   But it is about more than just cost for the Iraqi Linux User Group.  The open source enthusiasts believe it could allow Iraqis to build their own home-grown technologies.  "This enables the country to build its own infrastructure based on open source, on open ideas," Ashraf Hasson.  "That might help establish a solid base for Iraqi technology, and help not constrain the country with proprietary software and prevent monopolisation over Iraq by such major companies."  But getting Iraqis to think about Linux is an uphill battle. Most have never touched a computer, let alone thought about what operating system they want to use.  Computer software is now more widely available in Iraq, but little of it open-source.  "Currently, most software in use in Iraq is illegal copies of proprietary software," explained Don Marti editor of the US-based Linux Journal.  Software giants like Microsoft, he said, are happy to hook Iraqis on their software.  "Proprietary software companies are using these illegal copies as a free sample program, and a marketing tool, as they have in other countries."  "When the crackdown comes, and the people in Iraq start having to comply with the licenses for this software, then they're going to be in trouble."  It means Iraqis are going to have to start paying companies like Microsoft, who declined to be interviewed.    Obstacles in the way   Ashraf Hasson of the Iraqi Linux User Group said he would actually welcome tech giants like Microsoft coming into the Iraqi market.  He grudgingly even admitted that the Windows operating system may be OK for "people who want to do basic stuff".  But he is pushing small and medium-sized businesses, and the Iraqi government, to consider running open-source software on their servers.  He is also leading Linux seminars at a couple of Iraq's larger universities.  And Nabil Suleiman in Canada says that some expatriate members of the user group want to open a Linux training centre in Baghdad.  "But it all depends on how the political issues and all the other issues are resolved there," he said.  "I think it will take between two years and five years to stabilise the whole system, and then we can start building on a more stable foundation."  Inside the country, the Iraqi Linux User Group is thinking big. Their ambitious goal is to see every server in the country running Linux a year from now.  Getting there, they face numerous obstacles.  "Security, electricity shortage, poor communications, blurred view of the future, money, bad response from government, lack of resources," explained Hasanen Nawfal, "too many to mention."

She could not have conceived in her wildest imagination, Kanishka said, that 15 years later she'd not only be coming back, but also directing one of the nation's largest employers. Nor would she have envisioned her role as envoy of a discount Internet retailer located in, of all places, Salt Lake City.   "I can't say it's a dream come true, because I don't think I could have had a dream like this 17 years ago," said Kanishka, who moved to the United States from Pakistan in 1997 with her husband, a former childhood friend who had been working in the States.  The couple settled in Salt Lake City, where Kanishka later took a job as a customer service rep for Overstock.com, a site specializing in product liquidations. After little more than a year on the job, she took over management of the website's Worldstock division, which sells handmade goods.   These days, Worldstock employs more than 1,500 Afghan artisans among a worldwide network of craft workers. It's an accomplishment that Overstock's CEO, Patrick Byrne, attributes to both an upswing in online retail spending and reliable demand for inexpensive handmade rugs.   That confluence of factors culminated this week in a confirmation by the Afghan Ministry of Commerce that Overstock is currently the largest provider of private employment in Afghanistan. According to Mariam Nawabi, commercial attaché for the Afghan Embassy in the United States, Overstock is currently believed to provide employment, directly or indirectly, for about 1,700 people living in Afghanistan.   Prior to Overstock's arrival, Byrne was told that the country's largest employer was a brick factory in the Western city of Herat, which had about 400 workers.  "That was the (General Electric) of Afghanistan before we got there," said Byrne, who traveled to Afghanistan in March. "Now we're the GE."   Byrne's operation in Afghanistan is strictly low-tech. The company's suppliers largely work from home. Their chief products are rugs, embroidery, jewelry and fur-lined clothing.  Afghanistan is one of more than 30 countries that sell handmade goods for Overstock, and it is currently the site's largest foreign supplier. Rugs, according to Kanishka, are the top-selling item, ranging in price from around $200 to $1,700.   Overstock isn't the only one attempting to profit online by selling handmade goods from exotic locations. Competitors include retailers specializing in single-product categories as well as sites like Novica, an online venture backed by the National Geographic Society that sells crafts from a network of more than 2,000 artists around the globe.   The principle behind the business, said Roberto Milk, Novica's co-founder and chief executive, is to give people who traditionally sold their wares only at markets near their homes a chance to reach a much bigger group of potential buyers.   "For people who work with us, their economic situation changes because they have an ongoing way to sell to the world market," Milk said.   But Novica isn't a nonprofit venture. Milk estimates that the site's revenues are growing at a rate of 30 percent annually and he expects it to become profitable in the second half of the year.   Like Worldstock, Novica's wares span several continents. Suppliers include leatherworkers from the Andes, carvers from West Africa, basket weavers from Bali and Java, and painters from all locations.  Other online retailers are venturing even farther off the beaten path to seek out handmade goods.   Pete Burris, president and namesake of Alpaca Pete's, a retail chain and website that sells rugs and clothes made from the woolly South American alpaca, buys finished products almost exclusively from a group of about 4,000 Peruvians from the island of Amantani, located in the middle of Lake Titicaca, the highest-elevation lake in the world. Aside from a small tourism business, Burris says, his Alpaca exports constitute one of the only local sources of employment.   In Afghanistan, Kaniskha's network of suppliers consists largely of women who were prevented from working outside their homes under the Taliban regime. These days, many of these women make substantially more money than men.  Given the disparity between prevailing wages in developed and developing nations, both Overstock's Byrne and Novica's Milk say their goal is not to get the lowest possible price for handmade goods.   At Novica, Milk said, artists themselves set wholesale prices for the retailer, which are usually at least slightly higher than local prices.   On its website, Overstock says that it will not make a profit of more than 1 percent on goods sold through its Worldstock division. In practice, Byrne said, this translates into artisans receiving about $70 from every $100 customers spend on their wares.   By American standards, earnings for suppliers of handmade goods don't seem like much to rejoice about. Kanishka cites the example of one mother and six daughters who make about $400 a month embroidering shawls. In Afghanistan, where government workers commonly earn less than $40 a month, Kanishka insists, "that's big money."

The ISP’s claim that the USD30,000 ISP license fee required by the NCA is a big impediment to them rolling out services more widely locally. The ISP’s say the huge fees is a major reason for the slow pace of Internet growth in northern Ghana, as not many businesses would like to invest in Internet services in the North where the market is relatively small. The ISPs made the appeal during a Technical Update Seminar organised by the International Institute of Communication and Development, IICD, Centre for Information Technology Research and Development (CITRED) and Ghana information Network for Knowledge Sharing (GINKS). The aim of the seminar was to share information with the residents of the Northern region on connectivity options available in the world today and how best as a community they can develop and promote the region into the knowledge based economy using Information and Communication Technology tools. Ernest Kofie, Director of GrasRut, a cybercafé and ISP operator in Tamale, said considering the high cost of Internet usage to most of the people of Tamale, his ISP has adopted a community approach to the deployment of Internet in Tamale. He was therefore very agitated by the requirement of NCA to pay USD 30, 000 license fees as paid by all ISPs in Ghana. He pleaded to the NCA to have some waivers for ISP’s who decide to operate outside of Accra. Jonnie Akakpo of CITRED introduced new technologies to the participants and said it was important that the government take the new ICT4AD policy seriously and implement its recommendations to the letter. Denise Clarke of IICD introduced the Bgan Mobile IP Satellite Technology as one of the possible connectivity options for rural areas. She was of the view that such connectivity tools where relatively cheap and afforded people in the rural areas to also have access to the benefits of Internet. Kofi Mangesi of GINKS encouraged the community to continue to dialogue on how best they can influence policy in the area of connectivity.

The company has appointed the Mumbai-based investment-banking firm Strategic Capital Ventures Ltd as its exclusive financial advisor. RelTel hopes to raise about USD120 million from the Indian markets and tie up with an Indian telecom operator with expertise in large scale expansion projects. Sunil Pathak, director, RelTel, said that the funds will be utilised for expansion and will be a combination of debt and equity, adding that the company is willing to sell its controlling stake if all other criteria fall in place.Pathak said, "The similarities between Indian and Nigerian telecom services have prompted us to come to India as the expertise here can be very well utilised to shore up operations in a small but growing Nigerian market."He said talks are on with some big telecom players in India but declined to disclose names.

A key sign of improvement will be the signing, after years of haggling, of a final accord on the compatibility and inter-operability of the two blocs' rival GPS and Galileo satellite navigation systems.  For a long time, the US was not overly keen on what it saw as an unnecessary rival to its own GPS system. However, Europe went ahead, is building Galileo's first satellites, signing international agreements with Russia, India, Brazil, Mexico and China, and is set to be operational by 2008.  The EU-US agreement should reap benefits for both the US and Europe in a highly competitive satellite positioning market forecast to reach EUR 300 billion globally by 2020. Galileo is expected not only to create some 150,000 jobs in Europe, but also to herald a technological revolution comparable to that of the mobile phone.

European Commissioner for regional policy Jacques Barrot said in a statement that the programmes "will help to bridge the significant gaps in the enlarged European Union and contribute to integration and to territorial cohesion".  When the European Union grew to 25 members on May 1, its population increased by 20 percent but its gross national product rose only five percent, highlighting the development gap between the previous 15 members and the 10 new members.  The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said that efforts would in particular be made so that countries benefitting from the aid would have the administrative capacity to manage the funds.  About 15 billion euros were targeted at the poorest regions, defined as areas having gross domestic product equivalent to 75 percent of the EU average.  Poland, the biggest new EU member, would receive 8.2 billion euros, the biggest share of the aid, followed by Hungary with 1.9 billion euros, the Czech Republic with 1.45 billion euros, Slovakia with 1.041 billion euros, Lithuania with 895 million euros, Latvia with 626 million euros, Estonia with 371 million euros, Slovenia with 237 million euros, Malta with 63 million euros and Cyprus with 53 million euros  Source;  EU sources, June 04  Author;  LuisB    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   FOCUS    TELECOMMUNICATIONS – CORPORATE OVERVIEW   SA’s Telkom continues to make high profits    Telkom last week announced strong group annual results for the year ended March 31, 2004, with healthy increases in operating revenue and operating profit, positive cash flow growth, and excellent growth in both headline and basic earnings per share. The group financial highlights for 2004 include: -	8,8% group revenue growth to R40, 795bn;  - 	39,5% growth in operating profit to R9,088bn;  - 	40% group Ebitda margin;  - 	Group return on assets of 18%;  - 	Net debt to equity of 61%;  - 	Total dividend of 200 cents per share paid for the year. Commenting on the results, Group CEO of Telkom, Sizwe Nxasana, says: "The management of the Telkom Group is pleased to report strong results in our first full year as a listed company that has seen us execute well on strategy and deliver growing returns to our shareholders. "Group operational highlights include the Telkom Group achieving robust operational performance across all levels of the business, with delivery against its three strategic pillars of customer growth and retention, operational efficiencies and innovation and sustaining the development of the marketplace."   Key achievements include:   - 	14% growth of data revenue, 44% growth in Internet subscribers, 17% growth in ISDN channels and 661% growth in ADSL subscribers;  - 	The launch of VPN Supreme;  - 	Growth of voicemail accounts to nearly one million. Value-added fixed-line voice packages penetrate 64% of residential customer base;  - 	The introduction of new fixed-line calling plans, like Xtratime;  - 	The winning of 14 international call centre customers;  - 	The introduction of on-line ordering, payments and billing;  - 	Re-branded TelkomDirect retail outlets;  - 	The distribution deal with Vodashop;  - 	Property development deals to ensure upfront communications availability;  - 	Mobile customer growth of 30% to 11,2m customers with contract customer growth of 20%;  - 	Mobile gross connections of 6m, compared to 4m in the prior year;  - 	African mobile customer growth of 93%;  - 	Mobile data revenue growth of 59%.  Nxasana adds, "Telkom aggressively promoted data products to the consumer and SMME markets through campaigns in the past financial year, which advanced the group’s strategy of becoming the data provider of choice."   The increase in revenue growth was said to be mainly due to higher demand for data services in the medium and small business segment, with leased line revenue growing by 17,7%, which was offset by a 2,2% decrease in mobile leased facilities revenue, due to network optimisation initiatives by the mobile operators. There has also been a stringent focus on key business imperatives. The execution of group strategy helped Telkom SA to grow headline earnings per share by 175% to 863,6 cents, from 314 cents in its first full year as a listed company.  The group declared a final dividend of 110c per share, thanks to sustained revenue from traditional voice services and market endorsement of value-added data and mobile services. Telkom’s strategy to defend core revenues and enhance operating efficiencies lifted group operating revenue by 8,8% to R40,795bn (2003: R37,507bn).  Basic earnings per share grew by 177,5% to 812 cents (2003: 292,6 cents) through a 39,5% increase in operating profit to R9,088bn (2003: R6,514bn)and a reduction of finance charges, which included net losses of R776m arising from measuring derivates at fair value and currency volatility. Ebitda margins expanded to 40% from 35%, underpinning the generation of strong cash flows.  Telkom advanced on its stated plan to contain net debt to equity within a 50 - 70% range. Net debt decreased by 33,8% to R13,362bn (2003: R20,171bn), bringing the net debt to equity ratio to 60,6%, compared to 109,9% in the previous period. Group capital expenditure decreased by 7,1%, and represented 13% of group revenue, in line with the group’s guidance of maintaining capital expenditure in the range of 12 to 15% of group revenues.  The mobile segment accounted for 25% of group operating revenue, driven largely by customer growth that is evident in a decrease in contract churn. "Telkom has also allocated R7,7m in its 2004/05 financial year to programmes designed to control the HIV/Aids pandemic," Nxasana adds. Telkom’s strategy is to enhance education campaigns and to offer voluntary counselling, testing and treatment for affected staff across the country. Telkom estimates HIV/Aids prevalence at 9,6% within its workplace, which is considerably lower than the country’s estimate of 26,5%.  Nxasana says, "People are Telkom’s most important competitive asset, and are key to it being an efficient and cost-effective group. The group has implemented a strategic human capital management plan, which seeks to protect and nurture its people. Telkom’s people are driving operational efficiencies and innovation within the group, and are the people behind customer retention."  Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) also underpins Telkom’s drive for sustainability. Telkom has advanced its strategy, which elevates BEE as a crucial growth imperative for Telkom, by directing R5bn to BEE suppliers in the 2004 financial year. And, in its efforts to contribute to the development of a broad-based black middle class, Telkom created an estimated R560m in value for over 100 000 retail shareholders, who subscribed to Telkom’s Initial Public Offering (IPO). Telkom has also proceeded with a socially responsible approach to headcount reductions, which has been boosted by the Agency for Career Opportunities. This is an initiative to help employees, often through re-skilling, to become re-employed either internally or externally.  Telkom reduced its fixed-line headcount by 8,5% (excluding subsidiaries) to 32 358 in the 2004 financial year, with only 3,6% of losses being involuntary retrenchments. Telkom aims to reduce employee numbers on an annual basis by 7 to 10% per annum, including natural attrition. This will be largely enabled through the Operational Support Systems (OSS) initiative, which aims to provide automated solutions to enhance revenue and reduce costs. Already, increased employee productivity has been reflected in growth from 137 to 149 lines per employee.

       HIGHLIGHTS    ECONOMY – EU-CHINA   EU Rejects China's Bid For Market Economy Status   The European Union has refused China's bid to be recognized as a market economy after an investigation by the E.U. Commission concluded the Chinese government still micro-manages the economy, an E.U. spokeswoman said Monday.   'To arrive at that position we need to establish there is no state interference,' said Arancha Gonzalez, spokeswoman for the Commission's trade department.  In the past year, China has been lobbying hard for the so-called market economy status, which would make it harder for other countries to accuse it of flooding the market with cheap exports and level penalties against it.  In a report submitted to the Chinese authorities, the E.U. has also requested that China install and abide by corporate governance practices and accounting rules in order that accounting information be reliable enough to be consulted when China is accused of violating trade agreements. Laws governing bankruptcy and property rights will have to be imposed and implemented. Finally, China's banking sector must be freed of government control.  Until it fulfils these criteria, China will remain a non-market economy. That official label means its local prices and costs won't be used to determine whether it is dumping cheap exports. Instead, the E.U. will use prices and costs in a third country that is a market economy to determine whether China is guilty of dumping and calculate anti-dumping penalties accordingly.  The E.U. currently has 32 anti-dumping measures in force and 22 anti-dumping investigations going on against China, which is considered a non-market economy. Last year, 0.5% of Chinese exports to the E.U. were subject to anti-dumping charges.  The most important products by import volume subject to measures are bicycles and bicycle parts, fluorescent lamps, dead-burned magnesium and fluorspar, a commission statement said.  The U.S. has imposed anti-dumping duties on textiles, televisions, and wooden bedroom furniture - buoyant sectors that accounted for nearly one-fifth of Chinese exports last year.

The New Zealand National Commission for Unesco, the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Apia office and InternetNZ have drafted a memorandum of understanding to form the Pacific Internet Partners initiative.  The partner countries were chosen because of their strong links to New Zealand.  Laurence Zwimpfer, the National Commission deputy chairman, said the development of ICT skills in the Pacific was regionally important, and would be aided by the collaboration.  The initiative will see support this year for a Vanuatu conference, fostering of the establishment of national ICT professional organisations, and the establishment of internship and mentoring exchange programmes between New Zealand and the nations involved.  InternetNZ president Keith Davidson said members had wanted to get such an initiative off the ground for some time.  "By combining forces with UNDP, who are on the ground in these countries, and with Unesco's influence, we'll be getting significantly more bang for our buck."  Joyce Yu, of UNDP's Apia office, said the collaborative effort would allow better use of resources for meeting the UN's Millennium goals.  Don Hollander, chairman of Wellington's 20/20 Trust, who recently returned to New Zealand after two years working in Samoa on UNDP projects, said the agreement had been structured to let other interested parties join.  Hollander said Unesco New Zealand wanted to be involved in developing ICT skills in the Pacific.

Instead, the real life characters in Lowenstein’s cautionary tale spend the 1990s chasing passing ship after passing ship and disregarding the stars.  The outcome would prove disastrous.   The author of two best-selling books, Buffett: The Making of An American Capitalist and When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management and current SmartMoney columnist, Lowenstein takes readers on the fateful journey through the stock market’s late century rise and subsequent slide into the new millennium.  The author crafts an easy-to-read, well-researched tale that unfolds like a horror story.  The villains - corporate America’s executives and their posse - get bolder at every turn and the main character - the stockholder - falls prey to the inevitable outcome.   Early in the book, Lowenstein lays out the ingredients that create this fateful cocktail.  For more than half a century following the Great Depression, the stock market had fallen out of favor.  But a recession took hold in the 1970s and stock prices fell.  The “cheap” public companies were then taken over - many times by rivals in the same industry - by corporate raiders who purchased a majority share from company stockholders.  By the mid-1980s, takeovers had morphed into leveraged buyouts (LBOs), or buyouts financed by debt.  No publicly traded company was safe, and the groundwork for what Lowenstein calls “the great bubble” began to take shape.   “To escape a buyout, CEOs felt they had to raise their share price.  This was a significant departure.  Previously, stock prices had been seen as a long-term barometer,” writes Lowenstein.  “A new phrase crept into the argot:  ‘shareholder value.’”   Unfortunately, CEOs, whose job it was to maximize shareholder value, began to distance themselves from the phrase’s true meaning.  According to Lowenstein, the culprit was the stock option.  Although stock options existed prior to World War II, they entered the scene in a reenergized way in the early 1990s.   By giving company leaders a substantial amount of company stock, so went the reasoning, CEOs would become shareholders in their own firms, and would then behave like owner-managers.  Hindsight proved this thought process incorrect.  Since CEOs were not investing their own money, they assumed no risk.  Writes Lowenstein:  “A poker player will be aggressive when he is playing with ‘house money.’   “Execs intent on ‘managing’ their stocks became hypersensitive to a single number:  quarterly earnings per share.  From an economic perspective, quarterly numbers are virtually irrelevant because it typically takes years - not months - for businesses to bear fruit….  The game was to keep earnings rising, but never by too much, so as to save more for the next quarter,” Lowenstein writes.   Accounting statements became less and less transparent.  And as financiers got more and more clever - and as they walked the line between creative accounting and illegalities - they found themselves rewarded, notes Lowenstein.  In 1999, Andrew Fastow, Enron’s CFO, was awarded one of CFO Magazine’s prized Excellence awards for pioneering “unique financing techniques.”  A year before, Scott Sullivan, WorldCom’s CFO, had garnered an “Excellence award.”  A year later, in 2000, Tyco International’s Mark Swartz joined Fastow and Sullivan as Excellence award winners.   “That all three winners were eventually indicted testifies to Wall Street’s weakness for (too-) clever financiers.  And it hints at a serious problem with creative accounting:  it can lead to outright violations and fraud,” writes Lowenstein.    Making a quarterly number isn’t exactly the formula for long-term or enduring shareholder value, but Lowenstein argues that investors - especially professional investors - wanted to be mislead.  “Fund families such as Janus, Van Wagoner, and Putman would stuff their portfolios with Cisco, Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase - the hottest stocks - which purchases would drive up the stocks and thus the fund prices higher,” Lowenstein says.   Lowenstein dots his historical narrative with juicy behind-the-scenes details from memos, meetings, and events.  They lend a third dimension to Origins of the Crash.  One such detail comes from a 1998 speech SEC chairman Arthur Levitt gave at the Stern School of Business at New York University.  Levitt told students that “trickery is employed to obscure actual financial volatility.”    If Levitt knew this in 1998, why didn’t the SEC do something?  Because the SEC was understaffed and it couldn’t catch up with “corporate miscreants” until many quarters later if at all, explains Lowenstein.  “The lack of an effective deterrent, combined with the perverse structure of options, meant that, the rhetoric of pay-for-performance notwithstanding, many executives had an incentive to cheat,” he notes.    Although Lowenstein spends an entire chapter chronicling Enron (which he calls the “single corporation [that] could represent the corruptions of shareholder value”) and much of the following chapter deconstructing WorldCom, he is quick to point out that these companies were not alone in their misdeeds.  He offers readers several synopses of other questionable dealings, including General Electric and its star CEO, Jack Welch; Tyco and its acquisition-crazy CEO, Dennis Kozlowski; Xerox; Webvan; CMGI, an Internet incubator; and AOL’s merger with Time Warner.    Along the way, Lowenstein takes issue with analysts, bankers, auditors, lawyers, politicians, venture capitalists, the financial press and investors.  In many ways, they all conspired to look the other way.  Groupthink prevailed.  Lowenstein uses the case of Priceline to make this point:  “By 1999, Priceline, which resold airline tickets but owned neither gates nor planes, was worth almost as much as the entire, tangible airline industry….  The bizarre yet inescapable conclusion was that according to the mathematics extant at the turn of the millennium, a dotcom stock was worth more than an actual, cash-generating business.”   Although the stories in Lowenstein’s books are not new, his ability to flesh them out with firsthand accounts and research leaves the reader with an undeniable feeling:  what happened to the market at the dawn of the new millennium was years in the making and the manic “virus” of the times spread far and wide.   In the aftermath of the great bubble, what is left is a savvier public, beefed up government regulations and an SEC with as much bite as bark.  For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 aims to reign in the accounting profession.  CEO compensation packages are becoming more realistic.  Those who sit on boards of directors are now held accountable.  According to Lowenstein, ten underwriting firms were fined $1.4 billion for their part in the corruption and analysts are now barred from promoting their firms’ IPO’s.  Many of the corporate executives who created glowing quarterly earnings face jail time.   Yet, has anything been learned from these events?  Perhaps Lowenstein’s notes on the last page of his book, say it best:  “It is a chief lesson of the scandals that the culture of a community, more than any laws, provides the moral determinant for its behavior.”  Source;  University of Pennsylvania, June 04    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  MEDIA – INTERNET   Forget Radio, Tune In to Net     Web music broadcasting is the best thing to happen to radio since FM.   The concept has many names: Web radio, webcasting, streaming jukeboxes, Internet broadcasts. But the idea is much the same. Music fans "tune in" to various services through their Net-connected PC, where they can hear music from a huge range of genres. And not just the same 20 songs over and over again, like commercial radio. With Internet radio, listeners can tap libraries of millions of songs that would never be broadcast on the airwaves.   MusicMatch music player software, a fine rival to applications like Winamp. A free version of the program offers free streaming - unlike competitors like Napster and Rhapsody. Just keep in mind you have to keep a full-blown application running in the background to use this service.   The stations are fairly basic, with a few nice options: Listeners can skip songs and are alerted to the next artist in the queue. And, like Launchcast, users can create their own station based on their favorite artists. The more you use the service, the better it is at identifying your tastes.  A music store is integrated into the player, making it easy to purchase songs or albums you just heard. You also get an added bonus if you decide to use MusicMatch to store and organize your MP3s - it has some of the best rating and personalization features around. It's just a shame you can't carry the power of that personalization to the online radio features, which would make the whole package the ultimate jukebox.    Radio Free Virgin Lite:  Here's a player that lives up to its lite name. It has virtually no features. There's no need to download anything - the Web-based player launches at the click of a button on the homepage. A listener can select from 30-odd channels - some that are very slow to load - and that's it. While the player displays the song title, artist and album cover, there's no countdown, skip button, song history or customization options. While there is a volume adjustment on the player, it didn't work during our test.  Perhaps the only thing going for this service is that it's easy on the ads. There aren't any pop-ups, which is nice. And the audio ads are few and far between, making it easy to listen to a number of songs without interruption.    Winamp Radio:  While better known as an MP3 player, Winamp shouldn't be overlooked as an online radio service (in version 5.03c, click the Internet Radio link in the Media Library). It features a diverse collection of free music with superb sound quality.  Listeners can also access several of these stations through the Shoutcast directory. Shoutcast is a Winamp-based streaming audio system. It's also where aspiring DJs can spin their tunes for other listeners.  Scroll through the list of 500 streams and you can find everything from Korean DJs broadcasting blues to Russian pop hits, and find entire symphonies or video-game soundtracks. It's a nice alternative to some of the Net broadcasters that make you join their premium services to access the more obscure music.  You can also see cool information like bit rates and the number of other listeners tuning in. Another cool feature: Right-click on the station and you can bookmark it. No pop-up ads, either.   The drawbacks? Stations are occasionally cut out or are inaccessible, because many of them are run by independent broadcasters. And listeners don't receive much information on each  song beyond artist and title.

Compared with end May, the headline index was up by 5.4 points, with current conditions gaining 3.9 points over the month and expectations 6.9 points from May to June.  - 	While the index from the University of Michigan remained in June below the high of January, the index from the Conference Board reached its highest level of 2004, and in fact its highest reading in two years. After a marked rebound in January, both indices lost ground until May. However the fall in the index from the Conference Board index was limited to 4.6 points (from 97.7 in January to 93.1 in May) while the University of Michigan index decreased by 13.6 points (from 103.8 to 90.2).  - 	Details show that both declines were due to the component for expectations, even if, and contrary to the Conference Board index, the University of Michigan current conditions index also suffered. Regarding the Conference Board, expectations lost 10.5 points from January to May, while the economic outlook index from the University of Michigan declined by 18.5 points.  - 	Going further into details, it appears that expected business conditions were the main concern. Indeed, the decline recorded by expectations from the University of Michigan was due to an expected deteriorating financial position for just 15%, 85% of the deterioration coming from worse business conditions (especially over next year). Even if more broad-based, the deterioration of expectations according to the Conference Board survey was also mainly caused by business conditions (47%), and to a lesser extent by prospects for labour (31%) and income (22%).  - 	The University of Michigan provides with deeper details. For instance, it published an index retracing news heard about business conditions. These details show that the main component that drove down the composite index from January to May was "bad news from higher prices". This return of accelerating inflation is also illustrated by the sharp increase in the expected rate of inflation over next year, which is also part of data provided by the University of Michigan. While this expected rate was 2.7% in January, it jumped to 3.3% in June.  - 	Consumers thus expect inflation to accelerate. The first question to be raised is: Is this bad news? The answer is: No, not at all. When the Fed highlighted the deflation risks (in much softer terms…), one of its goal was to revive inflation expectations. Indeed, deflationary expectations can proved self-fulfilled: if consumers expect prices to go continuously down, this is never time to consume, since products will get cheaper with time; demand is thus contracting, which leads to downward pressure on prices. The marked increase in expected inflation is thus good news since it is an additional illustration that the risk of the deflation is well off the table.  - 	But does this increased expected inflation could be the sign of inflation actually accelerating? First of all, the sharp rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year surely contributed to the rebound in expected inflation. Second, as shown on the graph on next page, consumers proved particularly bad forecasters for inflation…  - 	In short, just keep in mind that inflation expectations have risen. In Fed terms, you could say, "the probability, though minor, of a rise in inflation from its low level exceeds that of an unwelcome fall in inflation". In clear, there is currently more risk of inflation accelerating than decelerating. Thus the additional monetary easing bias has to be removed. Something the Fed will start doing as soon as tomorrow, with a "moderate" 25 bp hike.

       HIGHLIGHTS   INDIA – ECONOMY   India goes cool on privatisation    India's new government has scrapped key elements of its predecessor's privatisation programme.   The communist-backed coalition, led by the Congress party, said in a policy statement that it would not sell off profitable state-run firms.  Privatisations of loss-making firms would be decided "case-by-case".  Last week, Indian share prices posted a near-record slump amid fears that the new coalition would reverse the BJP government's economic reforms.  The prospect of slower progress on reform has also spooked foreign investors, who have sold some $800m worth of Indian shares so far this month.  Privatising some of India's profitable state enterprises in the energy and heavy engineering industries formed a central plank of the BJP government's economic agenda.    Fiscal pressure   The new government's policy document pledged to raise spending on education to 6% of gross domestic product, and to encourage more foreign investment in the oil and energy sector.  It also set a target for annual growth of between 7 and 8%.  Economists said the new coalition's economic blueprint could put India's already overstretched public finances under added pressure.  "How will the increased spending on education be funded?" said Kishlaya Pathak, economist at Standard Chartered Bank.  "This is crucial because our fiscal situation is a matter of concern."  India's central government deficit stands at about 5% of gross domestic product, prompting warnings that the country must do more to balance its books.  There are fears that without the proceeds of further privatisations, or deep public spending cuts, the budget black hole could widen sharply.  Cutting public spending - much of it in the form of politically sensitive subsidies and non-negotiable interest payments on public debt - has proved an unpalatable option for most Indian governments.    Markets calm   Bombay's leading share index closed half a percentage point lower on Thursday shortly before the new policy agenda was unveiled, but analysts said the market would take the news in its stride when it reopened on Friday.  "The market has already reacted to the likely slowdown in reforms," said K K Mittal, fund manager at Escorts Mutual Fund in New Delhi.  The economic policy agenda was thrashed out in talks between the Congress party, the senior partner in the new coalition, and its allies, which include two communist parties.   The new coalition, entitled the United Progressive Alliance, won a surprise election victory two weeks ago over the BJP government.  Led by Manmohan Singh, a former Indian finance minister, the United Progressive Alliance won the contest thanks to the support of poor rural voters.  They felt the BJP's economic reforms had enriched an urban elite without delivering tangible improvements to the broad mass of the Indian people.  Analysts said the acid test for the new government's economic policies would come later this year, when it unveils detailed tax and spending plans in its first budget.  But the appointment of Mr Singh - the architect of a highly successful economic overhaul during the mid-1990s - as prime minister has helped soothe investors' nerves.  Mr Singh was named prime minister last week after Congress party leader, Sonia Ghandi, declined to take on the role.

Export, for instance, grew by 14 percent in the Philippines, 7 percent in Malaysia and Indonesia, 5 percent in Singapore, and 22 percent in Thailand. Plus, China and ASEAN countries' related trade negotiations ended ahead of schedule with extensive consensus reached. This shows the "10+1" Free Trade Area jointly advocated by China and ASEAN has made a big way ahead and is full of vigor.  ASEAN countries are China's neighbors and developing countries as well. Developing mutually beneficial cooperation with ASEAN and seeking for long-term stable development in relations with ASEAN is in line with China's interest and beneficial to the overall revitalization of Asia.   In recent years, mutual political trust constantly strengthened, economic exchanges increasingly grew and cooperation turned more and more fruitful. Bilateral trade between China and ASEAN has been growing by 15 percent since 1995. In 2003, it grew by 40 percent to a new high of US$ 78.2 billion, in which China imported US$ 47.3 billion from ASEAN, a 50 percent rise. Presently, ASEAN has become China's fifth largest trade partner, and China the sixth of the ASEAN.   The "early harvest" plan under the framework of China-ASEAN Free Trade Area implemented in January 2004 further pushed trade growth in Asia. For Thailand alone, Sino-Thai trade heralded in agricultural produce. Since China and Thailand initiated zero tariffs for vegetable and fruit on October 1, 2003, such trade rose rapidly. It has not only greatly promoted bilateral trade, but also provided new commercial opportunities for the enterprises of the two countries with materialized benefit.   Statistics show, in January to March 2004, vegetable trade between the two countries totaled US$ 114 million, in which China exported to Thailand commodities worth of US$ 13.98 million, a year-on-year rise of 87.84 percent, meanwhile China imported from Thailand US$ 99.63 million, a year-on-year growth of 143.42 percent. Official with Thai Ministry of Commerce said that Thailand is actively pushing free trade in other commodities, and is striving to realize zero tariffs in fish and milk products in 2004, and industrial products in 2005. Currently, national economies of China and Thailand have been growing fast, bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation intensified.   China's sustained and fast economic growth maintains a vigorous momentum of interregional trade in Asia. It is predicted at the ASEAN Finance Ministers' Meeting in Singapore on April 7 that the average economic growth rate in ASEAN countries will be 5.05-5.09 percent. Singapore scholar held, for ASEAN countries, to establish China-ASEAN Free Trade Area is conducive to catching up with China's economic high-speed train and to making sure that the ASEAN continue to play the role as an important economic zone. This is agreeable to its own interest.   Negotiations on China-ASEAN Free Trade Area started early 2002. In November 2002, the two sides signed framework agreement on economic cooperation, and decided to realize step-by-step free trade with zero tariffs. According to "early harvest" plan, over 500 kinds of commodities, mainly agricultural produces, will have reduced duties and to zero by 2006. Till 2010 when China-ASEAN Free Trade Area is established, there will be an economic area with 1.7 billion consumers, a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of two trillion, US$ 120 million economic aggregate. It will be the most populous free trade area, the largest one composed of developing countries.   In spite of a wide gap in economic development, different economic development stages among the ASEAN members, as well as their goals and acceptability, challenges will be conquered and mutual benefit realized as long as the two sides have negotiations with equality, seek common grounds while shelve the differences. Just as Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri put it, ASEAN-China cooperation has growing increasingly mature, and it is hoped that the dialogue partnership in trade, investment, technological cooperation, culture and society can be further enhanced to promote regional stability and prosperity.   Now China-ASEAN cooperation has made a breakthrough with marked harvest: the trade volume between China and Thailand in the first quarter of 2004 alone has exceeded US$ 3.8 billion. Singapore Deputy Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong stressed in his recent visit to China, the agreement on free trade area is a significant step forward and Singapore will have negotiations with China on free trade in 2004 to further push "10+1" Free Trade Area. With regard to the prospect, China-ASEAN Free Trade Area will be sure to maintain a constantly fast pace forward.

The issues supposed to dominate the two-day meeting and show how Nato is finding a role in the post cold war era are turning out to be uncomfortable.  In Afghanistan, the 26-member alliance is hard-pressed to provide a medical corps or a few transport helicopters for the 6,500-strong Nato-led International Security Assistance Force.  Its ambitions to develop its own Greater Middle East Policy have been lowered as Washington dilutes its grand plans for the region. Summit invitations to leaders from north Africa and the Middle East have been dropped. Discussion over Nato's future role in Iraq will also be limited, as world leaders focus on the handover of sovereignty two days later. So it is hardly surprising that the atmosphere at alliance headquarters in Brussels is gloomy.  But Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, 56, the Dutch politician who last January took over the helm of Nato, is not. As secretary-general, he seems determined to make a virtue out of necessity at Istanbul.  "There is no room for gloom," he says in a Financial Times interview. Indeed, Mr de Hoop Scheffer intends to raise more uncomfortable issues in Turkey, using the example of Afghanistan, Nato's first "out of area" mission, to spell out his plans for transforming the alliance. One is the military planning for missions, the other is how they are financed.  When Nato agrees on a mission, military planners call for "a force generation" conference where nations are asked what they can provide. Separately, Nato's overall "force planning system" has a huge inventory of helicopters, tanks, troops and aircraft. None, however, is immediately available for specific missions.  "It is not easy to generate forces," says Mr de Hoop Scheffer. "There is a dis-connect between the force planning system and the way we generate our forces. When we enter into the political commitment, we have to know what forces we can generate to honour that commitment."  In an ideal world, some Nato military officers would like a nation to commit a fixed set of capabilities, allowing the planners easy access. As a former foreign minister, Mr de Hoop Scheffer knows this is unrealistic.  "Sending out forces to missions is always a decision that involves national sovereignty," he explains. "If we can find a solution between the disconnect of force planning and force generation, we will not deny the Dutch, the Poles or anyone else [the right] to make their national decisions." The secretary-general says a review of how missions are financed might bridge the gap between the big, elusive toolbox and what nations actually contribute for peacekeeping missions.  Missions are financed on the basis of "costs lie where they fall", with each nation responsible for all equipment and personnel it deploys abroad. "The 'costs lie where they fall' is a principle that should be fundamentally discussed because it means certain nations that always have the assets will always be asked to deliver," says Mr de Hoop Scheffer.  He would, for example, like to see more common funding for the essential capabilities Nato needs for most missions: heavy airlift, transport helicopters and medical facilities - exactly the shortfalls in Afghanistan. A dozen or so nations finance Nato's Awacs, the early warning airborne control system. And a handful of European countries are funding the A400m heavy transport aircraft.  "We need to think more about common funding. We have to try to be inventive," says Mr de Hoop Scheffer. The structure of defence budgets are another problem. "Some countries have one defence budget from which you have to finance peacekeeping operations and new weapons systems. I think. . Peacekeeping operations should not be charged to the defence budget," he says. He does not expect Istanbul to deliver such ambitious aims. Instead, with Afghanistan as the catalyst and the big test for Nato's ability to operate out of area, he hopes to get the green light to start debate.

At the same time, participants in the new group openly hope it develops into an opposition vehicle that can mount a challenge President Askar Akayev’s hold on political power.   The group, calling itself the Union for Fair Elections (UFE), came into being May 20. At its core are several prominent opposition parties, including Ar-Namys (Honor), led by jailed Akayev rival Feliks Kulov, and the Social Democrats. Although dominated by the opposition, UFE leaders sought to portray the union as having a middle-of-the-road agenda. People’s Party leader Melis Eshimkanov, for instance, said the union would strive to act as “a third political force between the authorities and the opposition,” according to a report by the KyrgyzInfo news agency.   Perhaps the most surprising UFE participant is Misir Ashirkulov, who had been a member of the president’s inner circle of advisors. Ashirkulov was reputedly a leading centrist in Akayev’s administration, who, during the height of political tension in 2002, reportedly counseled that the president take a conciliatory approach toward the opposition. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. His decision to join UFE suggests that he lost a struggle against hardliners within the administration for control over the administration’s policy agenda. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive].   “Today we are uniting for real action, with good intentions, despite differences in our political views or party platforms,” said a UFE statement issued May 20. “We are ready to cooperate with all citizens who share our thoughts, aspirations and our position.” The appearance of the fair election union creates a headache for Akayev, who has come under fire in recent years for abandoning a democratic reform course. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. A report by the AKIpress news agency on May 25 said that Akayev, during a meeting with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Lynn Pascoe in Bishkek, complained about the US assessment of democratic reforms. The president told Pascoe that “Kyrgyzstan needed more balanced coverage and due assessment by US official structures,” the AKIpress report said.   Akayev’s democratic image was not helped by his May 24 decision to relieve Ashirkulov of his duties as Security Council chief. Presidential aides insisted the move was not related to Ashirkulov’s UFE move. Most local observers, however, believe Ashirkulov’s dismissal was an act of political retribution.  The biggest question surrounding the upcoming presidential election in 2005 is whether or not Akayev will seek a third term. Akayev has repeatedly said he intends to retire, but he has left room to change his mind. [For additional information see the Eurasia Insight archive].   Kyrgyzstan’s presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000 were criticized as flawed by international observers. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. Opposition leaders firmly believe that in a free and fair vote, they could win control of both the executive and legislative branches of government. Some participants say the UFE is designed to promote opposition unity with the specific goal of nominating a single candidate to run in the presidential election.   A variety of factors – including North-South sectional differences -- have helped keep the opposition divided to date. Akayev has often exploited the opposition’s fractious nature in his efforts to defend his political supremacy.   "We should be united to mobilize the electorate," Emil Aliyev, deputy leader of Ar-Namys, said in an interview with EurasiaNet. "Right now, there is a search for a leader. Possible candidates and their qualities are being discussed. It is important that the leader should be independent and should not be under pressure from other forces."  "We count on winning the elections if they are fair," continued Aliyev. "But I do not exclude that before the elections and during them unwanted candidates would be removed physically."   Given the uncertainty surrounding Akayev’s potential candidacy, some UFE members are hoping the opposition can get a jump on the presidential campaign. "The government does not have a distinguished person who could win the presidential elections in the first round," said parliamentary deputy Adahan Madumarov. "Therefore, the opposition is already [working towards] putting forward a common candidate. If we achieve that, we could demonstrate our power to authorities and to the people."  Many political observers believe the unified opposition’s candidate could turn out to be Ashirkulov. Other possible candidates include parliamentary deputy Kurmanbek Bakiyev, along with Madumarov and Omurbek Tekebaev.   Some observers suggest Bakiyev, a former Prime Minister, could be acceptable to Akayev as a “compromise candidate." Others doubt that Bakiyev enjoys much support in the presidential administration. One analyst stressed the sectional divide, pointing out that Bakiyev is a southerner while northerners dominate Akayev’s inner circle. A southerner’s rise to the presidency could unleash fresh, clan-driven political conflicts, the expert said. "They [Akayev’s aides] do not want a stranger entering their garden," the analyst explained. "[T] Hey would have to share influence, posts and property.”   Source;  Eurasianet, May 04  Write;  by Aigul Rasulova is a freelance writer based in Bishkek.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   NEW ZELAND – SOCIAL AFFAIRS   Government plans to build another 1000 state houses     The Government plans to build another 1054 State homes and make improvements to another 856 with money set aside in today's Budget.   The Budget allocates $128.9 million over the next three years to Housing New Zealand Corporation to acquire new State houses.  This takes the total for next year for the purchase of new State homes to $232m.  The Government said details would be announced next week but the money would be spent buying 1054 homes and making improvements to another 856 houses for State tenants.  In 2003/04, some $320m was available to acquire housing stock and modernise existing homes.  Housing Minister Steve Maharey also today said further funding of $4.8m was being provided in 2004/05 to continue to repair substandard housing in Northland, East Coast and the Eastern Bay of Plenty.  The Ministry of Housing was getting $3.4m to extend the Residential Tenancies Act to boarding houses once legislation currently before Parliament was passed.  The Act defines the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants and sets out disputes resolution processes.  It will be reviewed with $700,000 allocated in the budget.  The ministry will use some of the $3.4m funding allocation to better inform landlords and tenants about trends in the rental market.  A database, costing $1.3m to set up, would allow people to access information about past Tenancy Tribunal decisions.

Pertamina's expenditures currently are surpassing its income due to its obligation to meet domestic fuel oil demand with fuel oil bought on the international market at sharply inflated prices, a spokesman said.   "With a liquidity position below 2 trillion rupiah [US$215 million], the company is already bleeding," Pertamina's director of finance, Alfred Rohimone, told a hearing on Tuesday with the House of Representatives' commission on mines and energy.   At the end of April, Pertamina had cash reserves of less than $215 million, but the company's costs for importing crude oil and fuel products exceeded $540 million per month. The company's policy of making cash advance payments to purchase crude oil have also added to its loss of cash flow, Rohimone said.   As a result, the company, which imports some 300,000 barrels of crude oil and fuel products a day at international market prices, is on the brink of running a deficit, and has asked the Indonesian government to help it avert a crisis.   The country's current state budget has allocated some Rp14.5 trillion in fuel subsidies to Pertamina, based on an assumption of oil priced at an average of $22 per barrel. Pertamina should receive subsidy compensation for that entire amount, Alfred said, but in practice, with payments being spread over 12 months, the company only receives 70 percent of the total compensation.   At present, crude oil prices are hovering at a record high of more than $40 per barrel, and the government is scheduled to submit a revision to the 2004 state budget to the House of Representatives as early as July. At that level, according to Pertamina, the fuel subsidy could nearly triple to some Rp40 trillion ($4.35 billion), causing a larger deficit.   Pertamina has already had to spend Rp40 billion to buy crude oil at the price of $35 per barrel, Rohimone said. As a further consequence of the price rise, it has used Rp3.6 trillion of its monthly fee to the government to buy oil, he added.   "Pertamina must cover any shortage in payment with its own funds, Rohimone said. "But under the present unfavorable financial circumstances, the company may no longer be able to do so."   According to Rohimone, the company's current financial condition is largely linked to the previous management's policy of spending a huge amount of money to pay debts. The company had cash reserves of Rp23 trillion ($2.5 billion) in 2001, but said they were depleted through the repayment of government loans.   "The previous management in 2002 spent a lot of money to pay debts on several long-term projects. As a result, we are now broke," Rohimone said.   The lack of operating revenue has forced Pertamina to cancel several projects, and the company said it may liquidate three money-losing subsidiaries as part of its program to improve efficiency.   Pertamina has 14 wholly owned subsidiaries in various business areas including non-oil sectors. But based on an evaluation of the 14 companies, three of the subsidiaries will be liquidated and three others merged into other, better performing companies, Pertamina President Ariffi Nawawi said.   Pertamina also has decided to delay planned exploration activity in Iraq's Western Desert field until the United States has handed over legal and sovereign power to an Iraqi authority.  "We heard that the transfer of power will take place in June 2004. We will wait until this has happened," Pertamina's director of Downstream Industries, Bambang Nugroho, said on the sidelines of the meeting on Tuesday.   Pertamina had planned to begin its exploration activity in the Western Desert field in Iraq in March, but due to increased tensions in Iraq and reports that the US would hand over power to Iraqis, it has decided to postpone the plan's execution.   The company's losses, on top of costs that have exceeded government subsidies, have worsened Pertamina's economic health.   As a result, finance director Rohimone has forwarded several alternatives to the government to help overcome the company's rising deficit. Among them is a request for the government to pay Pertamina its marketing fee on time and to pay Pertamina the fuel oil subsidy compensation funds in advance, based on the actual price and calculations of asset reappraisals.   Rohimone has also asked that the government take over the company's obligation to pay tax and duties on public service operations.   "Short-term measures to cope with the financial crisis in Pertamina would be to release funds from the escrow account, a clear marketing fee [and] on-time payment of subsidy," Rohimone said. "A long-term solution would be improving the structure of the fuel oil price."   In addition, he said the company should review new investment projects, especially those that burden its cash flow.

Higher personal consumption ahead of the May 10 national elections and modest growth in private sector investments also contributed to the better-than-expected expansion in the country’s gross domestic product. Analysts had expected output in the first three months to rise by only 4.7 per cent. From the previous quarter, GDP grew by 2.2 per cent, the highest since the first quarter of 1999, according to the National Statistics Coordination Board, the government agency that compiles the national economic accounts.  President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who is leading in the presidential elections by a slim margin according to unofficial tabulations of the vote, welcomed news that the economy did well in the first quarter.  The strong economic performance "show that our economic policies and strategies are working," she said in a statement. But the data failed to cheer stock market investors who were worried that higher gas prices and transport fares might prompt the central bank to raise interest rates during the monetary board’s rate-setting meeting next week. Share prices in the Philippines on Thursday fell by 0.57 per cent. Romulo Virola, the government’s chief statistician, said economic growth in the first quarter was broadly based. Almost half of the 6.4 per cent GDP growth was contributed by services while 1.8 percentage points came from industry and 1.6 percentage points came from agriculture. He said investments in call centres and other business process outsourcing facilities have begun to pay off.  Mr Virola also said that first quarter farm output, which grew at its fastest in 15 years, benefited from good weather as well as recent government programmes to modernise the agriculture and fisheries sectors. He said rice production has been going up because of the introduction of new, higher-yielding hybrid varieties and the rehabilitation of irrigation facilities.

The two national flag carriers, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, were reported to have recently asked the ministry for permission to gradually add $2-$13 in surcharges to international flight fares if oil prices continue to rise.  The ministry said it is difficult to approve the request. But it has recommended the airlines increase market prices of air tickets, which are usually lower than permitted prices.   The airline companies plan to apply for permission again.   In March, the ministry had approved a hike in the ceiling of the ticket prices for international flights flown by the two national flag carriers by up to 7.7 percent.  Domestic flight fares will also increase starting July 16. Adjustment in domestic flight fares is totally up to airline companies, which are only required to notify the ministry of changes 20 days before the implementation.  Korean Air announced it will raise the fares by 8 percent for weekend flights and 13 percent for flights during high-demand seasons. It will also combine discounts for middle school students, high school students, and university students, into a single discount for youth between 13- and 22-years-old.    Asiana Airlines is not considering a raise in flight fares yet.   The fare raise plan has resulted from soaring crude oil prices. The average oil price for aircrafts during January to April has increased by 22 percent to $40.3 per barrel from $33 last year.   The ratio of oil costs among the total expenses of air companies was 18 percent for Korean Air and 21 percent for Asiana Airlines last year. If the oil price increases by $1 per barrel, Korean Air may shoulder an additional $25 million with Asiana Airlines assuming $13 million.  The high-speed train, which started running April 1, is another factor for flight fare increases, as passengers to and from Kimpo Airport to local airports in Kimhae, Taegu, Kwangju, and Mokpo declined by 35.2 percent to 412,000 in April from 635,000 a year ago.  The total number of flights has also decreased, with Asiana Airline reducing the number of flights between Kimpo and Kimhae from 16 to 11 per week, and between Kimpo and Taegu from eight to two.   ``To promote air industry and attract more passengers, we reduced the time for security checks by placing more monitoring machines, and cut the fees for parking lots at Kimpo Airport. We’ll also prepare business rooms in the airports as well as set a special department specifically for services such as cutting the waiting time for baggage,’’ a Korea Airports Corporation official said.

One side is the comfortable middle class.  The other - tucked into alleyways or barren lots - are slums that look like a scene out of Mad Max: low-roofed tin huts; wild-haired children walking naked. For centuries, these two worlds have been symbiotic. Slums provide housecleaners, cooks, and drivers for the middle class. The middle class, meanwhile, tolerates the slums as a source of cheap labor.  But this system is buckling under the pressure of India's burgeoning urban population, particularly over issues of health. Urban slums are the fastest-growing sector of India's population, expanding five times faster than rural areas. How the government deals with this problem could have widespread implications, both for the country's ability to attract foreign investors and to convince upwardly mobile citizens that life is safe enough to remain in India.  "When you analyze the urban slums and the statistics that slums will be growing at faster rates than other [areas], this is a serious concern," says Prasan Kumar Hota, secretary of family welfare in the Indian Health Ministry. Urbanization is a global phenomenon. In wealthier nations, most citizens already live in major urban areas or suburbs. But for poorer countries, the epic migration of villagers to cities is straining clean water supplies, sewer systems, and hospitals. Of the roughly 2 billion people to be added to the world's population over the next 30 years, more than 90 percent will be living in the cities and towns of poor countries, according to The Challenge of Slums, a recent report by the UN agency Habitat.  In India, there is a cruel twist. Decades of rural programs have brought clinics and healthcare to villagers. But now villagers are often leaving behind better healthcare in search of better jobs. In a recent survey in the state of Gujarat, for example, researchers found that 60 percent of surveyed villages had vaccinated their children, compared with 30 percent of slum dwellers.  A small collection of government bureaucrats, private volunteer groups, and feisty community leaders are starting to address the imbalance, one slum at a time. Here in Indore, an innovative pilot program - funded by USAID and run by private healthcare advocacy groups - is helping slum dwellers improve their own health conditions. With limited funding, this program chose 75 of the most vulnerable slums (out of 543), and focused first on education. "The most important thing is to deal with the sense of resignation that you find among most Indian slums," says Siddharth Agarwal, executive director of Environmental Health Project (EHP), a private aid group in New Delhi leading the Indore project. "These people should be the implementers. We may be wonderful doctors, but we will disappear one day, so if a program is able to train five people in that community, then the effort can be sustained." Training includes lessons on good nutrition, safer birthing methods, better sanitation, proper disposal of waste products, and proper hygiene, such as washing hands before food preparation. Some slum dwellers are learning how to demand access to drinking water and affordable health clinics.  The irony, says Mr. Hota, is that both politicians and villagers assume that the issue of urban healthcare will just resolve itself. "Somehow we all expect that urban poor, with higher incomes, higher number of doctors and hospitals, should be able to take care of themselves. But that is not true."  In fact, says Mr. Agarwal, 71 percent of the slum dwellers in Indore go to private doctors, "many of whom are not licensed, and all of whom are expensive." In Professor's Colony here in Indore - a neighborhood of modern concrete homes near the university - a band of women - middle-aged, poor, and barely literate - are educating themselves now on how to prevent health problems. Every few weeks, they meet with tutors from EHP in an effort to prevent illnesses that can devastate a poor family. During hot afternoons, during times that used to be reserved for gossip, the women share what they learn with other women in the area. Tara Bai, a 60-year-old who came to Indore 30 years ago, has learned more about childbirth in the last year than in all her life. Before, improper practices in washing babies after birth meant that more than half would die overnight from hypothermia. Before, mothers didn't use a sterilized string to tie the umbilical cord; many children died of infections.  Today, infant mortality in Tara Bai's slum has dropped dramatically. "We've had 8 to 10 births so far this year, and no deaths," she says. Her hut has become a meeting place of sorts for the 100 families of this slum. "If God gives light to you, you should know how to use that light." Best of all, Tara Bai says, this education is portable. So if city officials carry out threats to remove this slum, Tara Bai says, "I know how to go to a new slum and organize it; I can do it again."  Across town, in a slum at the city's scruffy edges, Shanta Bai (unrelated to Tara) has also been taking courses in healthcare, and improving the lives of her neighbors. (Bai is a common last name for Indian women here; it means wife in Hindi.) Shanta Bai comes from one of the poorest communities in Hindu society, the caste of rag pickers, who collect and sort trash for recycling. She's illiterate, but acts as a community pillar. "This slum has been moved three times in 15 years," she says, adding that she was born into an Indore slum 60 years ago. "But there is a support system here. We look out for each other."  She says her training has made her better prepared. "Before the class, I was blind. I would never have realized ... that we could do all this together," she says.

       HIGHLIGHTS    INDONESIA – POLITICS   Indonesia: Fragile Democracy   Presidential candidates 2004   Indonesians will head to the polls again on July 5 for the country's first direct presidential election. If no candidate gets the required 50 per cent plus one of the national vote, a second round of elections will be held in September. That round would require only a simple majority for victory.  There are five candidates in the poll: Megawati Sukarnoputri; Wiranto; Hamzah Haz, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; and Amien Rais.    Megawati Sukarnoputri  - Democratic Party of Struggle Indonesia (PDI-P) The staunchly nationalist Megawati Sukarnoputri rose to the presidency in July 2001, as the vice president who replaced ousted president Abdurrahman Wahid.  The daugher of independence hero Sukarno took power with a promise to bring stability to the country as it emerged from decades of authorcratic rule. However, faced with the task of bringing about reform in the wake of the Suharto era, a struggling economy, ethnic tension and the rise of Islamic extremism, Megawati's presidency has garnered mixed reviews. She has been accused of uncommunicative leadership and insufficient action against graft and a faltering economy. In the April 5 legislative polls, Megawati's Democratic Party of Struggle Indonesia (PDI-P) won only 109 seats, compared with 153 in 1999, and she is trailing her former security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, as favourite for president. Megawati has picked the leader of Indonesia's largest Muslim organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Hasyim Muzadi, as her vice-presidential candidate to broaden her appeal. However, analysts predict she faces a tough fight against both Yudhoyono and Golkar's candidate, Wiranto.   Wiranto  – Golkar Former defence minister and Indonesian military chief, Wiranto, surprised many when he was nominated as the Golkar Party's presidential candidate, ahead of the party's own chairman, Akbar Tanjung. Wiranto, 57, has emerged from retirement to run the presidential race and has promised stability, security and strong leadership for Indonesia. Wiranto, who is renowned for his love of singing, has vowed to serve only one term as president if he wins the election.  The former general is facing an arrest warrant by an East Timor judicial body over charges - which he denies - of crimes against humanity related to violence that erupted during the territory's split from Indonesian rule in 1999. International human rights groups have opposed the selection of Wirtanto as Golkar's candidate. However, foreign governments, including East Timor, say they will respect the democratic process in Indonesia and work with the him if he wins the presidency. Wiranto has chosen a human rights champion, Salahuddin Wahid, as his running mate. Wahid is deputy of Indonesia's human rights commission and the brother of former president Abdurrahman Wahid.   Hamzah Haz  - United Development Party (PPP) Hamzah Haz is Chairman of Indonesia's third largest party, the Muslim-based United Development Party (PPP).  The seasoned politician has been President Megawati Sukarnoputri's deputy since she became leader in 2001, but announced his bid for president in the 2004 poll after Megawati chose another Muslim leader as her running mate. Haz, 64, has at times been a controversial deputy president. He once described the United States as "the king of terrorists" and expressed support for radical Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir before Bashir was arrested as a terrorism suspect. He has chosen the transport minister and former army general, Agum Gumelar, as his running mate.   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  - Democrat Party According to recent pre-election polls, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former Indonesian military chief and chief security minister, is the favourite to win the presidential election.  Yudhoyono, 54, was security minister in President Megawati Sukarnoputri's coalition cabinet until he resigned in March 2004 amid a row with her over his presidential ambitions.  The popular former military chief, commonly known by his initials SBY, is one of the founders of the Democrat Party, established in 2002. The small party gained less than 10 per cent of votes in the April parliamentary poll, placing it fifth, but polls show it is personal popularity that will count most in the presidential race. Yudhoyono has pledged to fight separatism and terrorism and to win back investment if he is elected president.  Yudhoyono has chosen a former Golkar social welfare minister, Jusuf Kalla, as his running mate in the presidential race.   Amien Rais  - National Mandate Party (PAN) Amien Rais was one of the few outspoken critics of harsh government rule under former president Suharto, and was a leader in the nationwide demonstrations that precipitated the standing down of Suharto in 1998. Rais, 60, once led the second largest moderate Muslim group in the country, Muhammadiyah, which has thrown its support behind his presidential bid. In the past five years, the former university lecturer in politics has proved his prowess at the podium as Indonesia's Consultative Assembly Speaker. He has been described as a political opportunist and wildly ambitious, and is known for swinging his ideology from religious right to centre and back. Rais, whose National Mandate Party won less than 7 per cent in the parliamentary elections, has pledged to work safeguard democracy, restore the economy and fight corruption if he is elected president. He has chosen Siswono Yudhohusodo, a nationalist businessman and former minister under Suharto, as his vice presidential candidate.

In its annual report on the region's human rights, Amnesty says authorities are jailing, torturing and possibly even killing people under the guise of cracking down on terrorism.  It also says draconian laws that impinge on human rights are being drafted as part of counterterrorism legislation.  In particular Amnesty has accused China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand of harbouring the belief that human rights can be curtailed under the "war on terror" umbrella.   It says Hong Kong could have been added to the list had authorities not reacted to a protest by half a million people against security legislation many believed would have eroded civil liberties.    North Korea   The Amnesty report says while the threat of war between the regions newly nuclearised adversaries, India and Pakistan, has eased, thanks to diplomatic efforts, North Korea's resumption of reprocessing activities is a cause for grave concern. North Korea has also been singled out for a litany of offences, including doing little to relieve its population of the famine and starvation that has blighted it for much of the past decade.   Indonesia   Amnesty International says Indonesia resorted to increasingly repressive methods last year in its attempts to crush separatist movements in Aceh and Papua provinces.  The rights group has reported a rise in extrajudicial executions, "disappearances", arbitrary detention, torture, forced displacement and destruction of property since martial law was declared and a military operation launched in Aceh in May 2003.   It says military operations against both armed and peaceful independence activists in Papua also resulted in human rights violations, including arbitrary detention and torture.   China   The Amnesty report says China's rights record has made little progress in the past year and has worsened in areas such as the treatment of ethnic minorities.   Thailand   Thailand's war on drugs has marred its rights record in 2003.  According to Amnesty International, 2,245 people were killed in the three-month anti-narcotics campaign launched in February, which was aimed at curbing rampant methamphetamine addiction.    Burma   Despite its claims to be pursuing democratic reforms, Amnesty says Burma's ruling junta carried out serious rights abuses in 2003 including a violent attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition. It says some 1,350 political prisoners are languishing in the nation's jails, many of them prisoners of conscience. Among them is democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi herself, who was taken into custody along with other leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) after a May 30 attack on her convoy during a political tour of northern Burma.   Vietnam and Laos   Vietnam and Laos have both been accused of serious violations against freedom of expression. The Amnesty report condemns the Hanoi and Vientiane governments for their arrests and often-lengthy imprisonment of political and religious dissidents.

Officers from the country's central bank recently seized documents from a Port Moresby hotel, targeting yet another pyramid scheme promising fantastic returns for a tiny investment.   Our PNG correspondent, Shane McLeod, reports on the latest in a string of fast money scams, which have taken thousands of people for a ride.  For years fast money schemes have plagued PNG, making promises that are simply too good to be true. Promoters spruik fantastic returns for small investments - hundreds and thousands of per cent for just a few months' use of your money.  Sadly, they rarely deliver, something thousands of Papua New Guineans discover every year. One woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, lost money in a scheme known as Hosava. "One of them came and talked to me about it and he asked me if I can give him some money, just to invest it somewhere," the woman says. "I went there and I gave him $500 and then I did fill out the forms and he told me that after three months I would get the $36,000," she says. Of course she has never seen the money.    Fooling the public   The country's central bank, the Bank of Papua New Guinea, has wrestled with the schemes for years.  The bank recently targeted another scheme, called Papalain, which is believed to have been operating from a local hotel for months. The bank's deputy governor, Benny Popoitai, describes the people who run these schemes as convincing liars. "They are normally fast talking people who are able to convince the public to... place money with them, simply because they wanted a fast return," he says. "These people, the promoters of money schemes, are liars and they fool the public into placing money with them."   Scheme promoter on the run   Papalain is just the latest.  The most notorious of recent years was U-Vistract, which promised fabulous wealth to the many thousands who invested in it.  Some of the contributors, usually high profile Papua New Guineans, received their payouts. But most didn't, and were still waiting for their money when the central bank stepped in and closed down the scheme. U-Vistract's promoter, Noah Musingku, is still on the run, facing arrest warrants in PNG and Solomon Islands.  He's now said to be in Bougainville, in the company of reclusive secessionist Francis Ona, and reportedly making more claims about big payouts.  The governor of Bougainville, John Morris, told our reporter, Caroline Tiriman, that Mr Musingku is misleading a lot of people on the island. "I guess it is convenient for him to hide in the mountains of Panguna and continue to mislead those who are gullible," Mr Morris says. "It's taking the focus away from the real issues that the people of Bougainville should be involved in, for example finalising the constitution, working on reconstruction and rehabilitation of life on the ground," he says.   Anger against bank staff   Mr Popoitai from the Bank of PNG says his officers will continue to pursue the schemes, but concedes not everyone's happy when the schemes are closed down. "We don't get any more popular. The bank, the staff, and every one of us who do that, we don't get popular at all," Mr Popoitai says. "It's not a comfortable thing to do, to go out and tell the public that you just lost your money. So yes, we do not get any popularity out of this exercise. It's not something that we want to do, but we have to do it," he says. But in an environment where economic challenge is a daily reality, most expect the promise of a quick and fantastic return will continue to attract many.

Australia wants East Timor to honour an agreement signed last year covering the disputed Greater Sunrise field, which would give Australia claim to more than 80 per cent of the gas field. However, East Timor has so far refused. It claims the border should be drawn in the middle of the sea separating the countries, which would place 90 per cent of the oil and gas reserves on East Timor's side.  The argument has heated up in recent weeks, with Dili accusing Australia of stealing its resources and threatening its very future, and Australia vowing to stand by its rights.   The reportage  Four Corners investigates the increasingly rancorous fight between Australia and East Timor over the multi-billion dollar oil and gas bonanza that lies beneath the waters dividing them.  JONATHAN HOLMES, REPORTER: Three weeks ago, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, Dr Mari Alkatiri, swept into the lobby of Dili's best hotel. He'd come to open negotiations to establish a permanent maritime border between his nation, the smallest and poorest in the region, and his richest and most powerful neighbour.   East Timor wants the matter settled within three years. Australia has said it might take 20. It's a David and Goliath contest, and Mari Alkatiri had brought a sling full of verbal stones to hurl at his opponents.   DR MARI ALKATARI, PRIME MINISTER OF TIMOR-LESTE (ADDRESSING CONFERENCE): For us, a 20-year negotiation is not an option. Timor-Leste loses $1 million a day due to Australia's unlawful exploitation of resources in the disputed area. Timor-Leste cannot be deprived of its rights or territory because of a crime.   JONATHAN HOLMES: To open negotiations by publicly accusing your opponents of profiteering from a crime is, by diplomatic standards, like chucking a grenade. The Australian team returned fire with the curtest handshakes in their armoury. Back in Australia, their boss would be even less amused.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: I think they've made a very big mistake thinking that the best way to handle this negotiation is trying to shame Australia, is mounting abuse on our country, um...accusing us of being bullying and rich and so on, when you consider all we've done for East Timor.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Mari Alkatiri is unapologetic. He claims his country is being cheated, and he's going to go on saying so - to his own people, to Australia, and to the world.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I'm here to defend the interests of my people. Of course, there are many ways to do it, but I think that, uh, for a small country, a poor country to be listened to, uh...we need to voice loudly our voice, and that's what I'm trying to do.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Meanwhile, the Australian Embassy has been besieged by angry demonstrators.   PROTESTER (TRANSLATION): We know we have profitable resources, but we know that you are exploiting our oil and stealing it.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Four years ago, these people hailed Australia as their protector. Now they say that they'll be forced to play the beggar unless Australia stops behaving like a thief.   Just over an hour's flight to the south, the gleaming little city of Darwin dreams of future greatness. Across the harbour, in what was pristine wilderness just a few months ago, they're building a plant to liquefy natural gas for export to Japan.   CLARE MARTIN, NORTHERN TERRITORY CHIEF MINISTER: Four out of nine levels of the LNG tank has been constructed, and, uh, it really...in many ways it could double up a sports stadium. I don't know how it compares with Colonial, but it's big.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The gas will arrive through a seabed pipeline from a giant gas field deep beneath the Timor Sea, 500km north-west of Darwin. The Bayu-Undan field lies substantially closer to East Timor than it does to Australia. But just south of Timor lies the Timor Trough, 3km deep in places. Far easier, the oilmen claim, to run the pipeline across shallow seas to Darwin and its First World infrastructure. And far better for Australia too.  BRUCE FADELLI, PRESIDENT, NT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: So far there's been a large influx in construction into the Northern Territory. That's about to gear up even further in June with the start of the laying of the pipeline, so it's been a welcome boost to the construction industry.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the potential bonanza for Darwin lies in a vast, still undeveloped gas field called Greater Sunrise - three times the size of Bayu-Undan, and located still closer to East Timor. Territorians are fervently hoping that that gas will be piped to Darwin too.   BRUCE FADELLI: It's got the potential to create 80,000 jobs Australia wide - 20,000 in the Northern Territory - and the tax revenue benefit from all that investment is in the order of $22 billion over the 20-year life of the project.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The Timor Sea could transform Darwin into an industrial centre, and the Territory into a State. The town of Suai, just across the Timor Sea from Darwin, has no such grand ambitions. This is a different world.   On the whole length of East Timor's south coast, there is not one natural harbour. The fishermen of Suai have to use canoes that are light enough to come in with the surf. These are treacherous waters. The fishermen never travel far from the beach. Their catch is correspondingly modest. Their incomes are tiny, their horizons limited.   You have no thoughts about the oil and the gas out there in the sea there, about who it belongs to?   FISHERMAN (TRANSLATION): I'm sorry, we don't know these things. We don't know who it belongs to. But you can talk to us about fishing.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The women of Suai Loro take a still more modest share of the riches of the Timor Sea. Every morning they walk a kilometre from the village to collect water from the sea. And then, laboriously, they carry it back. Even the fresh water is brackish here. It's hard to eke a living from the salt-laden soil. So the women make their living from salt instead. If you earn a dollar a day in East Timor, you're comparatively rich. These women make much less.   It's taken hours to gather enough firewood for the job. It will take hours more for the water to boil away, leaving a detritus of sea salt. Early next morning in Suai market up on the hill the salt can be sold, or more likely bartered for a handful of rice or a parcel of greens.   KERYN CLARK, OXFAM COMMUNITY AID ABROAD: East Timor is one of the poorest countries in the world. It ranks as the poorest in Asia. Very high levels of maternal mortality, a high level of infant mortality, really poor nutritional practices, very poor food security. So, I think in terms of where I've worked, with often being in-conflict countries, I think really it does compare, unfortunately, with those countries such as Angola, Mozambique.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor, of course, is not in conflict now. But for 24 years it was - until the final paroxysm in September 1999.  This is how the marketplace of Suai looked after the militia and the Indonesian military had finished with it. By the time the INTERFET peacekeepers from Australia and New Zealand arrived in Suai, the culprits had fled into West Timor. The young men who'd been hiding in the hills filtered back into the town to greet their new protectors. Then they went to the ruins of the church, where their wives, their children and their old people had sought the protection of the priests.   Eyewitnesses say the militia used machetes to hack down the priests. The military tossed hand grenades into the church and used machine guns on those who ran out. The fleeing militia trucked corpses and survivors alike over the border to West Timor. Not all have returned. So no-one really knows how many were killed in Suai, but certainly hundreds.   The church has been repaired, the trauma has not and nor has much of the devastation.   KERYN CLARK: Many buildings haven't been rebuilt. There was also massive destruction of people's own assets, so their, um...for example, if they had ploughs or tools that they were working the land with, they've...they've gone. They lost a lot of their animals. They just really lost everything.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But at least East Timor did gain the independence it had fought for so stubbornly for 24 years. With the flags and fireworks two years ago came heartfelt thanks to its neighbour across the Timor Sea.   JOSE RAMOS-HORTA (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): John Howard, you are a friend of East Timor. Your support to our small nation is invaluable and we are delighted to welcome you among us tonight.   JOHN HOWARD (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): This is a very proud day for Australia but, more importantly, I know it is a very proud day for all of the people of East Timor. You deserve every moment of that warmth and pride.   ANGRY PROTESTER (TRANSLATION): We'll scream with all our strength, together as East Timorese. We will never be slaves again. Never again, never again! Long live the people of East Timor!  JONATHAN HOLMES: But now, in many Timorese eyes, Australia has been transformed from saviour to ogre. The argument is ultimately about oil and gas and money. But it's rooted in history and geography and the law of the sea. The Timorese believe it's crucial to their fledgling nation.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): It is a question of life or death, a question of being continually poor, continually begging, or to be self-sufficient.   JONATHAN HOLMES: To find the origins of the dispute, we must go back more than 30 years to when the Portuguese still ruled in Dili. Coup leader, General Suharto, was still consolidating his power in Jakarta. And Australia had become aware that beneath the seabed to its north might lie enormous wealth in oil and gas. In the late '60s, Australia and Indonesia began negotiating a permanent seabed boundary.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS, INTERNATIONAL LAW, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY: The legal background at that time was that the World Court in the North Sea continental shelf cases had just determined that the continental shelf is the natural prolongation of the land territory and that a state has sovereign rights in relation to the continental shelf.   JONATHAN HOLMES: If sea levels were 200 metres lower than they are, the continent of Australia would stretch far to the north. Only the narrow width of the Timor Trough would separate Australia from Timor Island. Australia argued that the Trough marked the edge of its continental shelf and the Indonesians essentially agreed.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: But that was the law then, you know. That was the existing Indonesian legislation and that was also, uh, the normal international legislation at that moment, so considering that one, I think it's somewhat fair at that time.   JONATHAN HOLMES: In 1972, the two neighbours agreed on a seabed border that followed the southern edge of the Timor Trough, much closer to Timor than to Australia. Opposite Portuguese East Timor, they left what came to be known as the Timor Gap. The Portuguese declined to negotiate with Australia to close the Gap. The law of the sea, they believed, would soon change in their favour.   But by 1974, after a coup in Lisbon, the Portuguese hold on East Timor was faltering. President Suharto's generals were advising him to annexe East Timor, by force, if necessary. Australia was trying to decide its own policy.   In August 1975, Richard Woolcott, Australia's ambassador in Jakarta, sent a secret cable to the Whitlam Government, which contained a now notorious paragraph. Australia, he remarked, had an interest in acquiring as much seabed as possible.   AMBASSADOR RICHARD WOOLCOTT, CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA, JAKARTA, 17 AUGUST 1975: This could be much more readily negotiated with Indonesia by closing the present gap than with Portugal or independent East Timor. I know I am recommending a pragmatic rather than a principled stand, but that is what national interest and foreign policy is all about.   CHARLES SCHEINER, INSTITUTE FOR RECONSTRUCTION MONITORING ANALYSIS: And that was Australian policy from that day until 24 years later - at tremendous cost of human life in East Timor.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: You can ask Whitlam and Fraser, but I think that is a complete myth. Um, that is, uh, selectively quoting one document. If that were true, then that would be a theme that ran through many documents and many public statements at the time. I don't think that that was something, which would have been significantly in their contemplation. I'd be certain of that.   CHARLES SCHEINER (ADDRESSING PROTEST RALLY): The Government of Australia should be ashamed of what they've done.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But if you want proof that oil was the key to Australia's policy, say East Timor's supporters, look no further than the Timor Gap Treaty of 1989.   CHARLES SCHEINER (ADDRESSING PROTEST RALLY): And that treaty was illegal and the whole world knew it was illegal, but Australia and Indonesia wanted to take advantage of the dying and the killing and the suffering and the struggling that was going on East Timor.   ONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty was famously signed by Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas in a plane circling above the Timor Sea. It hadn't proved easy, in the end, to close the Timor Gap. The Indonesians had changed their tune, now arguing that the Timor Trough was a geological irrelevance. For years, neither side would give way.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: But in the end we come to the realisation, despite our disagreement in settling this geological quarrel and dispute, we need to do something, and one way of doing it which is justified under international law is to develop a joint development.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty closed the Timor Gap not by drawing a line, but by carving out a joint development zone. Royalties from oil and gas found within it would be split 50/50. The northern border of the zone followed the edge of the Timor Trough. Its southern border marked the halfway point between Australia and East Timor, the so-called 'Median Line'.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: The Australian Government at that time did strike a compromise with the Indonesians, uh, and the Indonesians with Australia, in creating a joint development area and that was a pretty sensible sort of a compromise.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But to Fretilin's fighters in the mountains and its leaders in exile, the treaty was simply a sell-out. The UN had never recognised Indonesia as the lawful ruler of East Timor, but now Australia clearly did.   DR MARI ALKATARI, PRIME MINISTER OF TIMOR-LESTE: We immediately understood why, uh, at that time, Australia decided to recognise the illegal occupation and they...their reasons are the resources in the Timor Sea.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty gave the green light to serious exploration in the Timor Sea. Quite quickly, the oil companies struck viable deposits. The Corallina and Laminaria fields began production in 1999. Fortunately for Australia, both fields lay just south of its border with Indonesia and just west of the new joint development zone. So the royalties flowed entirely to Australia.   That same year, the East Timorese finally got to decide their own future. Chaos and brutality followed. Australia's leadership of the UN intervention force cost the Australian taxpayer a pretty penny. But the Treasury was already recouping at least some of those costs from the royalties from the Laminaria field, which lay much closer to East Timor than to Australia. Even as its soldiers were winning the gratitude of East Timor by securing its land borders, Australia was pushing hard for the continuation of the Timor Gap Treaty in the Timor Sea. But it found itself then, as it finds itself now, up against a feisty opponent.   PETER GALBRAITH, FORMER UNTAET NEGOTIATOR: It was the desire of the East Timorese and of the United Nations to negotiate about borders and we made that clear.   PETER GALBRAITH (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): East Timor is the legal owner of this territory.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Four years ago, Peter Galbraith, at the time an American diplomat, was UN boss Sergio de Mello's choice as the man to take on Australia.   PETER GALBRAITH: He smelt a rat in the Timor Gap Treaty. He thought that the 50/50 split was something that Indonesia had agreed to because it had gotten something in return - namely recognition of the annexation of East Timor - but that under international law, that wouldn't be the right deal for East Timor.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Right from the start, claims Galbraith, he made it clear that East Timor claimed total sovereignty over an area much bigger than the joint development zone.   PETER GALBRAITH: It would be wider to the east and to the west, and it would extend down to the midpoint between the two countries. We showed them maps in October 2000 here in Dili at the start of the first formal round of negotiations on the Timor Sea Treaty. We showed them maps as to what we thought was the correct line and we tried hard to get that line.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Australian negotiators adamantly refused to discuss permanent borders or anything outside the zone, until there was a sovereign East Timorese government to talk to.   PETER GALBRAITH: And so we had no choice. We had to negotiate about arrangements for this area, which is only part of Timor-Leste's maritime space, to see what kind of deal we could get relating to petroleum in that area alone.   JONATHAN HOLMES: On the face of it, they got a pretty good deal. In July 2001, Mari Alkatiri, representing East Timor's unelected leadership, and Peter Galbraith, for the UN, signed a provisional agreement with Australia, which would later form the basis of a new Timor Sea Treaty. Instead of 50%, East Timor would get 90% of tax revenues from oil and gas in the joint development area. The Australians now claim it was a generous concession, which recognised the gross disparity of wealth between the two sides without entirely surrendering Australia's legal position.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: We obviously had a robust negotiation, but in the end we decided that we'd give them 90% of the government revenue on the basis of generosity. I think when a country is generous to another country, to turn around then and accuse them of bad faith is probably not a brilliant negotiating tactic.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The East Timorese, even then, saw it differently.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): We can't understand Mr Downer, Mr John Howard saying they are being generous to us, we can't. According to international experts and international law, if the maritime border is the median line between the two coastlines, we are the one being generous with Australia. We are giving 10% of what belongs to us to Australia.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Peter Galbraith, now a private consultant, has been brought back to Dili by Mari Alkatiri, to lead the East Timorese team in its border negotiations. But he's been making the same argument all along, based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which, since 1982, his team maintains, has changed the law entirely.   PETER GALBRAITH (ADDRESSING MEETING): Nuno will outline the legal case.   DR NUNO ANTUNES, MARITIME LAW ADVISER, TIMOR-LESTE: Equidistance or very slight variations of equidistance - over 60 cases.   If two states lie less than 400 nautical miles apart, they claim, as Australia and East Timor do, the border should be drawn halfway between them, regardless of the shape of the seabed.   PETER GALBRAITH (ADDRESSING MEETING): How many cases support their argument?   DR NUNO ANTUNES: I only know of one, which is the Australian case.   PETER GALBRAITH: In fact the court, in a number of cases, including one between Libya and Malta, explicitly said that where states are less than 400 nautical miles apart, the underlying features are of no relevance whatsoever.   JONATHAN HOLMES: When Australia assigned 90% of the royalties to East Timor back in 2001, says Peter Galbraith, it was because it knew its legal case was fatally weak.   PETER GALBRAITH: They know full well that under international law a court would put the boundary at the median point between the two countries and that would mean that 100% of the resource in the area that was the subject of the Timor Sea Treaty would come to East Timor.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, he would. I mean, he is the negotiator for East Timor. And, I mean, you couldn't call Mr Galbraith an objective analyst or observer in this case.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: I think Australia has a credible case to put.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Professor Gillian Triggs, who's been a commercial consultant to Timor Sea oil companies and advised regional governments on maritime law, believes Australia's claims still have validity.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: But I think it also has to be understood that the 1982 convention still privileges those states that have a continental shelf. In other words, if you actually have a shelf, then you're entitled to the full extent of that shelf.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the Timor Sea Agreement had its advantages for everyone. Crucially, it gave ConocoPhillips and their partners the security to pour billions into the big new gas field at Bayu-Undan, which lies entirely within the joint development area. The LNG plant and the pipeline to Darwin went ahead, bringing jobs and investment in their wake. By 2007, East Timor should be receiving tens of millions of dollars a year in royalties from Bayu-Undan.   But even back in 2001, there were plenty who believed that the secretive negotiations had sold East Timor short. Outsiders were beginning to realise what the negotiators had known all along - that East Timor might well be entitled to total sovereignty, not just over the joint development area, but over tracts of the Timor Sea at either side. The argument is that the lines which define the eastern and western edges of the joint development area are not where they should be. They closely follow lines of equidistance between East Timor and Indonesia. In other words, every point on those lines is an equal distance from the nearest point of land on either side.   But according to Dr Nuno Antunes, a respected maritime law expert who's on East Timor's negotiating team, equidistant lines in this case don't produce a fair result - and international law demands fairness.   DR NUNO ANTUNES: For example, this line here, which is the line to the west of the JPDA, is completely influenced by one single point here, which is on the Indonesian coast, and why? Because if you...if you notice, this point is very close to the boundary and is very prominent, and it has an undue impact that international lawyers identified as, uh, a special circumstance, and that special circumstance should be object of relief - i.e., in a way that would turn the boundary to this side.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Similar though different arguments apply to the eastern border of the joint development area, says Dr Antunes.   DR NUNO ANTUNES: And that would be my opinion why these lines have to be opened to accommodate to a further extent the rights of Timor-Leste.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS, INTERNATIONAL LAW, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY: On the, um, authorities that I've read, that part of the coastline to the western side of East Timor is a relatively smooth coastline and is one from which an equidistant line can properly be drawn, but there is always another view, and indeed, if so, then that should be discussed and negotiated.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Even a small adjustment to the lateral lines could make a dramatic difference to East Timor. If a maritime boundary were agreed only slightly to the west, East Timor would gain all the royalties from the Laminaria oilfields - perhaps another $300 million a year for the next few years. Far more lucrative is the massive Greater Sunrise field to the east. Based on the current line, 20% of the field lies inside the development area, and 80% under the Australian seabed. The Timor Sea Treaty agrees to divide the royalties accordingly. But shift the line just a few kilometres eastward, and those proportions might be reversed - putting billions of extra dollars East Timor's way over the next 30 years.   JOSE TEIXEIRA, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INVESTMENT, TIMOR-LESTE: We don't take the view that these resources belong to us in this generation. These resources belong to future generations of Timorese. We are committed to sustainable development of this country. We are committed to a permanent petroleum fund that will utilise these resources in a sustainable manner, not just for us, but for our children, our grandchildren, our grandchildren's children. That's what it's all about.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor's total budget today - for education, for health care, for infrastructure, for security - is around $100 million - that's a good bit less than the Australian Sports Commission's. But even that much money is hard to find. From people as poor as this, there's precious little tax to be raised. International donors' funds are already drying up. The revenue from Bayu-Undan will enable East Timor to subsist for the next 20 years. But $8 or $10 billion extra, wisely used, could theoretically provide financial security and real development for the long term.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): We know we can develop this land, give our people a better life, and we feel that this opportunity is being taken away from us. And on top of that, it's something that belongs to us.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: If there is an issue of economic disparity between Australia and East Timor, that should be addressed through aid programs, which it is, um...and other mechanisms. That should not be addressed through shifting boundaries and changing international law.   JONATHAN HOLMES: That professed regard for international law rings somewhat hollow in some ears, because in March 2002, just weeks before East Timor gained its independence, Australia announced it would no longer accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice on matters relating to its maritime borders.   CHARLES SCHEINER, INSTITUTE FOR RECONSTRUCTION MONITORING ANALYSIS: Australia claims to be a democratic country. It claims to be a law-abiding member of the world community. Uh, they've...Australia has withdrawn from the courts. Can I commit a crime, then withdraw from the court and say, "No, the court had no jurisdiction"? My neighbours wouldn't be very happy about that.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We have said that we would rather negotiate all of our arrangements with other countries, not just with East Timor, but with Indonesia. And remember, we have to think about our other relationships when we think about this relationship. We will determine all of those on a bilateral basis. Not having courts and arbiters and, you know, people over there in the Hague deciding on our relationship.   PETER GALBRAITH, LEAD NEGOTIATOR, TIMOR-LESTE: Australia's decision to withdraw from the International Court of Justice reduced East Timor's opportunities to get a fair maritime boundary in accordance with international law. There's no question about it.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The eve of Independence, in May 2002. Behind the scenes, the new nation's leaders are under huge pressure. The oil companies and the international donors, as well as Australia, were insistent that their first action must be to sign and then ratify the Timor Sea Treaty.   A chorus of voices at home and abroad had been urging the new Prime Minister not to trust Australia, not to sign, to hold out. But he ignored them. A rival oil company has even filed suit in the USA recently, alleging that ConocoPhillips, the operator of Bayu-Undan, paid millions of dollars to Mari Alkatiri for his signature.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I never received any single coin from anybody.   PETER GALBRAITH: Those kinds of allegations are, um...crap.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Alkatiri says his country desperately needed the money from Bayu-Undan and he believed the Treaty would give him the leverage to pressure Australia into negotiating new permanent borders. When Alexander Downer next came to Dili a year later, it looked as though Alkatiri had succeeded.   DR MARI ALKATARI (ADDRESSING PRESS CONFERENCE): It's formally recognised already that there are overlapping claims in the zone. That's why we're going to initiate a new process of negotiation on maritime boundaries. We will do it.   ALEXANDER DOWNER (ADDRESSING PRESS CONFERENCE): We have lively negotiations, Australia and East Timor, because we're lively and interesting and entertaining people. So, um...we'll look forward to that. (Laughs)   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Australia's been in no hurry. Two years after independence, the first substantive negotiating session's just been held. At Australia's insistence, six months will pass before the next one. In East Timor, they plant and harvest a rice crop in less time than that. From the paddy fields of Suai to the government in Dili, a sense of impatience and even betrayal has been growing.   MARIA AMARAL (TRANSLATION): That's why I'm asking the Australian Government to resolve the oil issue quickly - so that our young ones will be able to work and look after their younger siblings and we will be able to send our children overseas to study.   JOSE TEIXEIRA, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INVESTMENT, TIMOR-LESTE: It's become quite clearly evident, particularly in the latter part of last year, that in fact what was always intended to be an interim provisional treaty was in fact going to be used to extract a permanent benefit.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor claims Australia is in flagrant breach of international law by continuing to take the revenue from the oilfields of Laminaria. They're in an area, they say, which even Australia has recognised is in dispute. Yet in a few years, there'll be no oil left.   PETER GALBRAITH: I don't expect the Australians to come to some quick conclusion. I don't expect them to change their position, but I think they should be in the same position as East Timor - that is, nobody gets the resource until we can agree who gets the resource, and that's exactly what has been required under international law.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Even Professor Triggs acknowledges that there's a case for putting the royalties from Laminaria into a trust account until the matter's resolved.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: It's not for me to tell the Government what to do, but I think that if there is any credibility to the East Timorese argument on shifting that line further to the west, and if that were to be determined on any objective assessment of the law and of the geographical features that you mention, then there's a very good argument for putting the funds in escrow for a period.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the Government doesn't appear to accept that East Timor's claims have sufficient credibility to justify any such action.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, our response is that we're there in the Australian area, in the Australian maritime area, and that we will treat them - those areas - as such. I do make this point. I don't think that the tactic of strident rhetoric and denunciation of Australia - accusations of greed and ill faith and so on - I don't think that tactic in the end, which is a big surprise to us after all we've done for East Timor, I don't think that is going to prove to be very successful.   JONATHAN HOLMES: It's true that East Timor has been blatantly playing to the gallery. It claims it has no other choice.   DR MARI ALKATARI (ADDRESSING CONFERENCE): In addition to blocking a judicial resolution of our maritime dispute, Australia is unilaterally taking the resources from the disputed area.   RADIO ANNOUNCER (TRANSLATION): Australia should respect the people and help us for the future. It shouldn't exploit a small, poor country. We are poor because our resources are in the sea. We are not able to exploit them.  JONATHAN HOLMES: But Mari Alkatiri does have one more card, and he's played that too. Investment in the all-important Greater Sunrise field can't go ahead until the East Timorese Parliament ratifies yet another complex treaty governing how it's to be taxed and the revenue divided. Dr Alkatiri's government signed the so-called Unitisation Agreement last year. But in the current sour climate, he claims, even his own party, Fretilin, would vote against ratification.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: I think their idea here is that they think that they'll get more concessions out of us by delaying ratification of the Unitisation Agreement and, um...  JONATHAN HOLMES: Will they?   ALEXANDER DOWNER: I think, um... I think not, no. We've reached agreement on unitisation. The best strategy for them is to build good will.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Sunrise can't go ahead, can it, unless that's ratified?  ALEXANDER DOWNER: It won't go ahead, no.   JONATHAN HOLMES: When the border negotiations finally began three weeks ago - months later than East Timor would have liked - the diplomatic niceties were observed. But only just. The talks themselves, from East Timor's point of view, were little short of a disaster.   PETER GALBRAITH, LEAD NEGOTIATOR, TIMOR-LESTE: I don't think these negotiations are going any place at all because the Australian side has refused to talk about the key issue, which is - where are the lateral lines? And why is that the key issue? Because that's where the money is. The location of those lines means the difference between $4 billion for East Timor and $12 billion for East Timor. The Australian position is that that is not on the table. That's not a matter that's subject to negotiation.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We will talk about anything, but we have our own claims, remember? I mean, I know they have their claims. I know they have their claims and I know they have their arguments, and I've seen in the media the fairly strident things that they've had to say, including denouncing my country. I've seen all that and I know all that. But, remember, we have our claims. And we want to stick with our international legal principles, principles that have served us in relation to negotiations with Indonesia, with Papua New Guinea, with New Zealand.   JONATHAN HOLMES: It's Indonesia, as always, that really matters to Australia. The next government in Jakarta may be still harder to deal with than the current one. Australia is determined that East Timor's border claims should not provide another source of friction with its biggest neighbour or, worse still, call into question its longest maritime border.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Some of the claims they're making in relation to the lateral boundaries will make those lateral boundaries closer to Indonesia than to East Timor. Well, that, of course, isn't a proposition...that isn't a legal proposition that is going to stack up. And that's going to get them into a lot of difficulties with Indonesia.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Indonesia will argue that its seabed boundaries with East Timor should follow the lines of equidistance. Any concession by Australia on lateral boundaries would involve concessions by the Indonesians too. They're unlikely to be cooperative.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: I cannot see the reason on what basis that line north-south on this side should be changed. I don't find any justification, and I think East Timor would have difficulty in arguing it.   PETER GALBRAITH: That is a matter to be negotiated both with Indonesia and with Australia, and, of course, East Timor wants to negotiate with both countries. But there's real urgency to the negotiations with Australia and there is no urgency with negotiations with Indonesia. Why is there urgency to the negotiations with Australia? Because, as we speak, Australia is pumping petroleum out of the area that is under dispute, the Government is getting $1 million a day, and so that already, since 1999, $1.5 billion is gone. Every day that we delay is $1 million less for this country.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I think that it is time for the Australian Government to listen to its own people. The people is voicing loudly on this issue and it's better to listen to their own people.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The Timorese seem to believe that the Australian public will be as sympathetic to their cause this time around as it was four years ago. But their loyal supporters in Australia are finding the going tough.   MAN (ADDRESSING RALLY): Today is the formation of the Timor Sea Justice Coalition in Darwin, and this is our first action. Ironically, the enemy has changed from being Indonesia to Australia...   JONATHAN HOLMES: Massacres are one thing, maritime borders quite another. So far, the issue has hardly set Australia alight. The Howard Government seems confident that most Australians will applaud it for hanging tough.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We will do what we believe to be right, but, of course, in our interests, we are on Australia's side. I'm the Australian Foreign Minister. The obligation on me is to negotiate for the 20 million people in Australia.   PETER GALBRAITH: All we ask is that Australia stop taking the resource until we have an agreement, or that Australia negotiate seriously and rapidly about all the issues, including the lateral boundaries, or that Australia agree to an impartial decision by an international court of Australia's choosing. Any one of those three.   JONATHAN HOLMES: A rapid resolution seems unlikely. There have been harsh words and bitter feelings on both sides. There's no mood at present for pragmatic compromise. It's undeniable that the relationship has soured. Most Australians still feel proud of what their nation did to help its tiny neighbour. But for an Australian in East Timor these days, gratitude is hard to find.

The move could see the country driving down the worldwide price for the medicine. But international experts caution that quality must be assured. In response to a mushrooming HIV/Aids epidemic that has seen many poor farmers affected, the Chinese government in December 2002 gave approval to several domestic pharmaceutical firms to make generic versions of Western drugs whose patents had run out, to try to lower the cost of treatment.  So far, four Chinese companies are producing the anti-Aids medicine.  Shanghai-based Desano Biopharma Corp is exporting seven kinds of raw materials to India, Thailand and Brazil, the Xinhua news agency said.  According to Desano, its partner in South Africa reduced the annual medicine fee for an Aids patient from more than US$10,000 (S$17,000) to US$3,000 after using its materials.  However, international experts said China's Aids drugs have not passed standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).  'Lots of efforts are needed for the improvement of quality,' said Mr Zhao Pengfei, the WHO's HIV/Aids coordinator in China.  Currently, some 7,000 Aids patients in China are taking the Chinese anti-retroviral cocktail treatment under a pilot programme, but health officials have said about 20 per cent of them stopped due to severe side effects. Health experts said they supported having more Aids drug producers if the quality could be controlled.

The surplus with Asia, the largest export market for Japan, expanded in a year to Y667.2 billion ($8.5 billion), to post a 10th consecutive monthly gain.  Asia-bound exports rose 19.6 per cent to Y2.49 trillion, with shipments of cameras and other optical equipment jumping 42.2 per cent, and electronic parts up 13.4 per cent.  Exports of steel products to Asia rose 25.7 per cent due to a shipbuilding boom in South Korea, a ministry official said.  Japan's exports to China rose 18.8 per cent while imports from China grew 12.9 per cent.  "The pace of growth in exports to China somewhat slowed as exports to China have until recently been rising 30-40 per cent year on year," the official noted.  He said it was uncertain whether the slowdown might have been caused by anti-inflation measures by the Chinese banking regulators, such as reducing money in circulation.  Shuji Shirota, senior economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo, said: "Japan's deficit with China has been shrinking due to increased exports but the latest data showed export volume was falling slightly."  Imports from Asia climbed 9.1 per cent to Y1.83 trillion as purchases of electronics parts, such as semiconductors, increased 29.2 per cent.  Imports of office equipment, such as computers, rose 20.8 per cent and audio-video devices were up 27.0 per cent.  "The basic picture of pretty strong growth of exports is unchanged and I think that's still the main positive news for the economy going forward," said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities.  Japan's overall trade surplus in April rose 30.3 per cent to Y1.08 trillion. The surplus with the US fell 2.4 per cent to Y553.5 billion.  The surplus with the European Union expanded 1.6 per cent to Y275.2 billion.  "The figures confirm Japan's economy is still dependent on external demand. And it's becoming clear that its reliance is shifting towards China and other Asian economies from the United States," said Toshihiko Matsuno, a senior strategist at SMBC Friend Securities.  Although gross domestic product data last week showed that exports were no longer the biggest contributor to Japan's economic recovery, economists said they remained a key factor underpinning the domestic turnaround.  The GDP data showed that the economy grew a real 1.4 per cent in the first three months of this year, with external demand accounting for just 0.2-percentage point of the expansion.

Officers from the two sides sat together at 10 a.m. at the resort of Mount Kumgang, on the northern side of the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that bisects the Korean peninsula and separates some 1.8 million troops, South Korean defence ministry officials said.   Five-member delegations headed by South Korean Commodore Park Jung-hwa and North Korean Brigadier General An Ik-san were expected to hold about two hours of talks focusing on avoiding naval clashes in the Yellow Sea west of the Korean peninsula.  In recent years, the rich fishing grounds have been the scene of naval clashes during the crab-fishing season in May and June that have killed or wounded scores of sailors on both sides.   The two Koreas technically remain at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. The defence ministers of the rival Koreas met once in 2000 and more junior officers have worked together successfully in the building of rail and road links through the DMZ.

       INDIA – POLITICAL AFFAIRS     India: New challenges await Sonia Gandhi   India's prime minister elect Sonia Gandhi will meet with president Abdul Kalam again tomorrow to stake her formal claim to power. This time she will go armed with letters of support from members of parliament accepting her as their new prime minister. With over 320 supporters her position is assured, but challenges remain.    Presenter/Interviewer:  Kanaha Sabapathy   Speakers:  Amit Mitra, Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce; Somnath Chatterjee, leader of the Communist party of India (Marxist); Manmohan Singh, Congress leader and former finance minister    SABAPATHY:  Once her position as prime minister is secured Sonia Gandhi must move quickly on a number of fronts if she is to establish confidence and stability.  The stock market which dipped by 17 percent to an all time low on Monday has rebounded by six percent but Amit Mitra from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce says the market will return to normal only when other factors are finalised.   MITRA:  Prime Minister is more or less certain, but the cabinet is not certain. Common economic program is not certain. The kind of front it will be is not certain - what is the kind of structure it will be.Therefore the minute these certainties will come in place, you will see the market returning back.    SABAPATHY:  The Congress is the largest single party, but with its allies it controls only 219 seats in the 545 seat parliament. The left parties which control just over 60 seats are opting to stay out of government but have agreed to support the Congress in order to keep the BJP out. Somnath Chatterjee is the leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).   CHATTERJEE:  You see we have our different policies and programs especially economic policies it is well known and in the three states we are in power our main politcal adversary is the Congress Party. And therefore we can't take a dual role, fight there and be in the government here.   SABAPATHY:  It is the Marxist views on economic development that are the source of concern. The CPI has from the very begining said that its against disinvestment and wants a more human face to economic reform, thus generating the fear that Congress may be forced to back track on economic development. Congress leader and former finance minister Manmohan Singh however says there's no need for panic.   SINGH:  There is an uncertainty, I think - justified or unjustified. My own feeling is the fundamentals of this country's economy are sound; therefore there is no need for panic.   SABAPATHY:  Infact Mr Chatterjee says that the panic in the stock market had been manipulated to create instability.   CHATTERJEE:  I can tell you this is nothing but a manipulation which has been done by a section of the people who are sympathetic to the BJP and who have got all sorts of unmerited benefits out of this BJP's compromise with some sections of the market industry.   SABAPATHY:  Standing by the performance of the Marxists especially in the state of West Bengal… where it has been in control for the last 27 years, Mr Chatterjee asserts that they are not for isolation.   CHATTERJEE:  We are not for isolation we are not for a closed-door policy. We are inviting everybody only thing we are saying it cannot always be a jobless growth; it has to be a pro-development growth and development for the common people. Nothing else, we are only saying let us not go on selling our undertakings for the sake of only disinvestment. Disinvestment must be tested at the crucible of public benefit.   SABAPATHY:  Sonia Gandhi nonetheless faces a number of other pressing issues. She needs to negotiate with her partners and form a cabinet soon. Who gets what portfolios will indicate the course India will take in the future. If Manmohan Singh, the architect of India's economic reform program, is given the finance porfolio, market stability would be ensured. He has already said a capital market is important for India.   SINGH:  A healthy, well-functioning capital market is in the interest of the country and we will take all necessary steps to ensure that our markets continue to perform that function as efficiently as possible.

       HIGHLIGHTS   CHINA – LEGAL AFFAIRS   China's middle class rebels   Doves coo in their cages overlooking the stone courtyard, and the shouts of a man collecting goods for recycling reverberate along the narrow alleyways.   On the surface, this maze of enclosed courtyards, one-storey houses and narrow stone passageways seems to be a picture of traditional Chinese life.  But against this peaceful backdrop a drama is being played out, pitting tradition against modernity, and individuals against the power of the state.   Beijing's old city is being swallowed by the urban sprawl of shopping malls and six-lane highways. Whole blocks are being razed as China moves to create a city of the future to host the 2008 Olympics.   In one area undergoing redevelopment, I met 47-year-old Liu Changshan by chance. He invited me to visit his house, which is facing demolition. It stands alone in a wasteland of broken bricks, the only remaining structure in the entire block.   He described his emotional ties to his property.  "My mother and father got married here," he said. "They bought this place before 1949. We're six children and we all grew up here.  "Now my mother and father have both passed away. I can't bear the thought that this house will be destroyed."  But Mr Liu is refusing to go for financial reasons. He said the compensation offered was not enough to buy a new place, even in the suburbs.  He will get $1,000 per square metre, less than half the market value of the site. And the personal cost is enormous - he has already sacrificed his 20-year-long marriage.   "My wife is someone who works hard, she couldn't live in these conditions. We really felt strongly for each other but every day we argued about our situation. I knew we couldn't go on, so we had to separate, then we divorced."   Mr Liu is among those paying the price for the city's facelift. One Swiss non-governmental organisation estimates 300,000 people have been evicted in Beijing to make way for Olympic projects.   But officials have argued that figure is too high, and they insist those relocated benefit by having an average of 40 sq m more space per family.  Officials turned down my requests for an interview.    'Benefits'   Lawyer Lester Ross often represents developers. He believes that many residents are happy to take the compensation and move.  "In many instances, people are going to benefit because a great deal of the housing in Beijing, as well as other cities and rural areas, is very substandard," he said.   In the past, he has had to tackle problems caused by forced evictions by subcontractors working for the city government. But he believes the attitude is changing.  "One of the reasons why construction proceeded so fast is because they have been able to disregard what are considered to be basic rights of people who are residents or who maintain small businesses.  "If you just bulldoze them out of the way, then of course new construction can go on much faster. Beijing, in particular, is concerned now with the greater attention that's coming with the Olympics. Beijing doesn't want the great construction that's under way to be tarnished by public protests," he said.    'Damage done'   Recently the government announced it will demolish fewer buildings in a bid to tackle growing discontent.  But if Ye Guozhu is anything to go by, the damage may already have been done. His family's house was knocked down with their possessions still inside.  Unhappy with the compensation offered, his brother appealed to the authorities but got nowhere. Desperate, he tried to commit suicide in Tiananmen Square and was given a two-year jail term.    Mr Ye is deeply embittered by the experience.   "This unchecked demolition over the past few years has changed the way that people think about the party and the government. Now people think our government isn't governing for us. They're bandits and hooligans. It's a very deep problem. People have already lost confidence in the government," he said.   He now liaises with others who have lost their homes. His movements are monitored by the authorities and I was detained when I visited him, an indication of just how nervous the government is.   And he is not the only one who has turned against a government he once supported.  "These demolitions aren't being carried out properly. They're not taking account of people's rights. Everybody thinks that," said Liu Changshan, the man whose house faces demolition.  Then he pulls back some blue plastic sheeting to show me six huge containers of petrol lined along the walls.  "I'm prepared to take this fuel and pour it over my body. If they knock my house down forcibly, I'll set myself on fire," he said.   It is a sign this urban renewal is spawning a new generation of revolutionaries. It is ironic that in a communist country that has jettisoned so much of its ideological baggage, homeowners are now being thrust into the position of rebels, defying their government to defend their own property.

The government's pension reform package was based on a more optimistic fertility rate of 1.32 for the year, forecasting it to eventually recover to around 1.39. A figure above 2.08 is needed to sustain the population.   Opposition lawmakers had demanded that the latest figure for 2003 be disclosed before the government-sponsored pension bills were passed.  Some have speculated that the ministry intentionally delayed the announcement of the figure because the government's pension reform plan was based on a more optimistic scenario.  The revelation that the government had already estimated the actual figure to be lower than that used in its pension reform package could fuel further public distrust of the system.  Responding to a written request from Takashi Yamamoto, a House of Councilors member of the Democratic Party of Japan, the welfare ministry said the head of the division in charge of demographic statistics reported an interim result of the latest data to the head of the ministry's statistics and information department on May 24.   But the ministry only released the data on the afternoon of June 10, after major newspapers reported the figure in front page stories that day.  The total fertility rate is a calculation of the average number of children that a woman will bear during her lifetime.  A senior official of the ministry's statistics division said Tuesday the interim figure was "around 1.29." He claimed the figure was tentative and not ready for official release.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda meanwhile defended the ministry.  "You need to analyze various factors even after figures are obtained," he told a regular news conference. "Usually it takes several days before publication."  The government's fertility rate forecasts have been consistently overoptimistic for more than two decades, forcing it to repeatedly revise down pension premium revenue assumptions.  A higher birthrate prediction is politically favorable for the government, which has been trying to bathe its social security plan in a rosy glow.  Pension reform will be one of the key topics in the July 11 Upper House election. Welfare minister Chikara Sakaguchi declined to say whether the ministry intentionally delayed the release of the figure.

According to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lee Wen-chung, Wolfowitz said that if Taiwan does not treat its national defense seriously, then the Americans won't either.  Wolfowitz said that if Taiwan did not take action as soon as possible to strengthen its defenses, China would be encouraged to invest more on military equipment, Lee told the Taipei Times after he and a multi-party legislative delegation headed by Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng (王金平) spent a day in Washington discussing Taiwan's arms procurement budget with top defense and State Department officials.  The 15-member delegation was briefed by 25 US military and civilian officials during a breakfast meeting on the first day of a three-day visit on Monday morning, and then went off to separate meetings at the Pentagon and the State Department.  Although Wang is from the pan-blue camp, he still showed support for the purchase.  "The balance of military power on the two sides [of the Taiwan Strait] is necessary to the area's peace, stability and prosperity," Wang said.  The delegation was to attend a congressional meeting yesterday to discuss the prospects for a measure before the US Congress to enhance military relations between the US and Taiwan through greater joint activities and mutual visits by top officials who are currently barred from such visits by long-term US policy.  That measure, proposed by Senator Sam Brownback, is expected to come up for a vote this week. The House recently approved a parallel bill.  On Monday, American officials were "vague" about the US' commitment to help Taiwan fend off an attack from China, Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Legislator Sun Kuo-hua told the Taipei Times.  After the US officials insisted that it would be in Taiwan's best interests to buy the weapons stipulated in the special budget package - diesel submarines, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot anti-missile systems - the legislators received somewhat unsatisfactory answers to their questions, Sun said.  When asked if the US would come to Taiwan's defense against China if it were to buy all the weapons, the US side was "vague," Sun said, "because they couldn't say they wouldn't come to our defense, because if they said that, Beijing would say, `Okay, let's attack.'"  "I think the United States is keeping that deliberately vague," he said.  Washington has long been pressuring Taiwan to buy the robust weapons package US President George W. Bush promised in April 2001.  Meanwhile, Pentagon officials were still unable to provide details on the design and cost of the eight diesel submarines included in the package, Sun said.  "We didn't even see a configuration for the submarines ... there's a lot of uncertainties in the cost estimates," he said. "The United States Navy doesn't know."  Sun indicated that Washington was still looking toward various European countries to provide the designs.   But the US officials "gave no indication where the subs will come from" and could not provide a price estimate, Sun said.  "They could only give a rough estimate. We want them to be more accurate," he said.  "How can we approve the cost in the budget if we don't know?" he said.  US shipbuilding companies, "cannot build diesel submarines," because they have not manufactured any for more than 40 years, Sun said.

China-Tokyo is expressing concern about a potentially lucrative natural gas field being developed by China near the border of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the East China Sea.  Japanese officials say the project may infringe on Japanese sovereignty, while China says it seeks joint development with Japan.  On Monday, Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi met her Chinese counterpart, Li Zhaoxing, here and expressed her concern.  Kawaguchi, who is visiting China for a regional ministerial conference, asked Li for information on the Chunxiao project because officials in Tokyo believe the area being drilled by China may cross over to Japan's EEZ, Japanese government officials said.  ``There is a possibility the area marked off by China for drilling could be on Japan's side of the border dividing the two countries' EEZs,'' Kawaguchi said, according to officials.  She said it was possible the underwater gas field extends beneath the sea floor into what Japan considers its side of the boundary, and that Japanese natural resources could be tapped by China.  The Chinese foreign minister did not address Kawaguchi's requests for details. Instead, Li said the two sides should continue to stay in touch on the issue.  Li suggested that Japan and China ``shelve their differences'' and jointly develop the gas field.  In Tokyo, Shoichi Nakagawa, minister of economy, trade and industry, said Tuesday in a regular news conference that the government has no plans to jointly develop the natural gas field near Japan's claimed EEZ.  Nakagawa said he plans to inspect the site from a Japan Coast Guard aircraft.  Tokyo and Beijing dispute the boundary of the EEZ in the East China Sea. Tokyo contends that it is drawn at equal distances from the shores of the two countries. But China maintains the border is where the continental shelf ends.  The rig used in the Chunxiao project sits on the Chinese side of the line that Tokyo insists is part of its own EEZ.  Li's suggestion for a joint venture may be interpreted as an attempt to offset criticism from Tokyo, analysts said.  Officials noted that Japan could not join the project anyway, as it is almost finished. Western companies have been helping China.  ``China has not given a direct answer to Japan (over its concerns). They just want to buy time,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official.

A second front, however, opened at once over an issue where Congress finds it harder to take the moral high ground. Several ministers in the coalition government are tainted by criminal charges filed against them.  The new Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, is revered both as a successful former finance minister and as an incorruptible public servant. But he has never won a direct election. Many elected politicians have far dirtier hands. Under rules that came into force last year, candidates in Indian elections now have to reveal their criminal past. According to a tally by Outlook, a weekly magazine, no fewer than 100 of the 542 present members of the lower house face criminal charges.  They include ten of the 25 MPs from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) party, Congress's biggest coalition partner. The RJD's fief is Bihar, which, with more than 80m people, is India's third most populous state, and the one where crime and politics are most inextricably linked. A notorious gangster, Mohammad Shahabuddin, was re-elected to parliament last month for the RJD. The fact that he is notionally in prison - in practice, in a comfortable hospital - and was described in a police report last year as a “cold-blooded murderer and hard-core criminal” was, apparently, not an insurmountable obstacle.  The RJD's leader, Laloo Prasad Yadav, stood down as Bihar's chief minister in 1997, when he was arrested on corruption charges, but installed his wife as his proxy. He still faces charges related to one of the biggest frauds on the Indian state ever uncovered, involving the “purchase” by the Bihar government of billions of rupees-worth of non-existent fodder. Mr Yadav, who, rather bizarrely, has become the new railway minister, claims the charges against him are all concocted by his political opponents. Similar claims are made on behalf of his party colleague, Mohammad Taslimuddin, the minister of heavy industries, accused of crimes including attempted murder, intimidation and extortion.   Privately, senior Congress figures say how much it pains the prime minister to welcome such people into his government. In public, Mr Singh points out that they have never been convicted of any crime, and Congress accuses the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party of hypocrisy. Its government, whose six-year tenure ended last month, included a number of politicians facing criminal prosecution for involvement in a riot in 1992 when a mosque was demolished at Ayodhya, triggering widespread communal violence. Bihar is only the most egregious example of a national phenomenon. Criminals bribe and intimidate their way into office for the protection it affords and the opportunities it offers for recouping their investments. Jayaprakash Narayan of Lok Satta, an electoral-reform lobby group, quotes an estimate of 20m rupees ($440,000) as the cost of standing for election in Bihar.  There is some hope that if the new government carries out its promise to introduce the state funding of elections, politics may attract a nicer class of person. Mr Narayan also argues for a system of proportional representation to break the link between constituency and candidate. Perhaps more pressing is the need for an overhaul of the criminal-justice system, which at present seems to produce fewer convictions than ministers.

Dr Amien Rais has been a daily fixture, making appearances on talk shows expounding on themes ranging from politics and the economy to football. But incumbent President Megawati Sukarnoputri has so far shunned TV debates, agreeing only to appear on taped interviews. So far, Dr Amien's polished style - mixing humour with serious remarks - shows him to be the best communicator among the five candidates. While some observers argue that he benefits from such exposure, others doubt the appearances will win him more votes. Viewers who prefer the stern mien of a military man might be more inclined towards retired generals Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Wiranto. Mr Bambang, another regular of presidential debates, has faced Dr Amien in at least three debates when other candidates have failed to show up at the last minute. While Mr Wiranto gladly appears on talk shows or dialogues, he is reluctant to show up alongside other candidates in a debate. However, while media exposure might boost their bids, some candidates have chosen to stage no-shows, citing reasons like illness or fatigue. But commitments to take part in televised debates are no guarantees that they will turn up eventually, Mr Riza Permadi, news director of new TV network Trans TV, told The Straits Times. Last week, the more established SCTV also cancelled a debate between Mr Wiranto and Dr Amien when the former pulled out at the last minute, citing fatigue from constant travelling. Mr Hamzah Haz also called in sick an hour before a debate on Trans TV that was to set him and his running mate against the Wiranto- Salahuddin Wahid pair. But Ms Megawati is by far the most media shy. Trans TV has so far failed to get Ms Megawati to appear on its weekly presidential debates because it refused to concede to her demand to replace a team of panelists comprising analysts and human rights activists with journalists. Ms Megawati is the only candidate who has not agreed to participate in Trans TV's fourth - and last - presidential debate next Monday. Analysts attribute the president's coolness to live appearances to her lack of media savvy. Said University of Indonesia political communication expert Deddy Hidayat: 'Ms Megawati's communication skill is among the worst of the five candidates. 'From the interviews we have seen so far, she appeared authoritarian and temperamental, especially when she is being asked critical questions.'  Regardless of candidates' desire for air time, however, analysts doubt whether the debates have any significant effect in winning voters over. For one, the TV debates have been criticised for being too 'clinically clean' - candidates are not allowed to confront each other as they field questions from teams of panellists or members of the audience. Often, the debates also get fairly pedestrian, with candidates saying similar things. And their answers could also exhibit more style than substance. Said media analyst Hinca Panjaitan: 'Both the panellists and the candidates like to use big words and show off their sophistication. This may backfire on them by alienating uneducated viewers.'

Days ago the Civil Union Bill had been expected to comfortably clear its first reading tomorrow and go to a select committee for public scrutiny.  But last night, numbers in favour of the bill had dropped, as some Labour and National MPs indicated they had major reservations.  The bill offers civil unions as an alternative to marriage, for gay and straight couples.  A second new law, the Relationships Bill, would end discrimination against same-sex and de facto couples but is not expected to be voted on until next week.  An indication that numbers are tighter than expected has come with Prime Minister Helen Clark's clear support for civil unions.  And yesterday Labour's first openly gay MP, Chris Carter, argued passionately for the two bills.  If they were voted down, he said, New Zealand risked its reputation as a society tolerant of diversity.  He also reminded fellow Labour MPs that introducing civil unions and ending discrimination against gays was party policy.  At least 60 of Parliament's 119 MPs will have to back the bill for it to be sent to a select committee.  Last week, the bill was thought to have support from 70 to 73 MPs. That may now be down to 63 or 64 votes.  Up to 10 Labour MPs oppose the bill. Their votes will be critical, as will any move by MPs to abstain.  Those in Labour thought to oppose civil unions include critics of the law decriminalising prostitution last year, such as Taito Phillip Field, Dover Samuels, Clayton Cosgrove, Damien O'Connor and possibly Harry Duynhoven and Janet Mackey.  Two who backed prostitution laws, but are against civil unions, are Cabinet ministers Paul Swain and John Tamihere.  Most of those MPs also form a conservative cabal within Labour, and were unhappy at Helen Clark's February Cabinet reshuffle, which saw David Benson-Pope inherit the Civil Union Bill from his sacked predecessor Lianne Dalziel.  Complicating the debate is the civil unions' companion legislation, the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill, which would end discrimination against couples who are not married, both straight and gay, and in de facto or civil union relationships.  NZ First yesterday said two of its 13 MPs had indicated their support of the Civil Union Bill to a select committee. Only a handful of National MPs are expected to do the same.  United Future's eight MPs oppose the bill. The nine Green MPs and two Progressive MPs support it.  Act's eight MPs are split, and independent Donna Awatere Huata remains undecided.

Investors may not provide the support it needs to become an independent entity.    The so-called second board at the Shenzhen stock exchange is opening with a roster of eight companies. Their six-digit tickers begin with 002, setting them apart from Shenzhen's 000 series and the 600 used in Shanghai, the bigger of mainland China's two exchanges. The stocks will trade on the same electronic system and be subject to the same regulations as stocks on Shenzhen's main board.   Ophelia Tong won't be a buyer. The investment director of Hong Kong-based HT Capital Management said she did not pay attention to smaller exchanges such as Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise Market or even Shenzhen's main board. "What's the point?" she said. "It's insignificant."   Without commitment from investors, the new forum may not draw enough money or listings to avoid the fate of similar initiatives. Nasdaq Stock Market pulled out of its Nasdaq Japan venture in 2002 after two years of losses, and turnover on Hong Kong's GEM, which opened in 1999, has slumped.   Some investors say creating the second board may detract from China's efforts to stamp out financial scandals at companies such as Guangxia (Yinchuan) Industry, fined last year for the nation's biggest securities fraud.   "The primary concern for fund managers is corporate governance and the quality of the assets," said Ho Kok Hua, a fund manager at APS Asset Management in Singapore.   Securities scandals helped make Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks the world's worst performers last year even as China had the fastest economic growth among major nations. Shanghai's composite index rose 10.3 percent while its Shenzhen counterpart fell 2.6 percent.   This year, the Shanghai index has fallen 4.3 percent and Shenzhen is down 2.8 percent. The benchmarks are among the 10 worst performers this quarter out of 60 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg.   Shenzhen's second board adds another pool of stocks to China's array of Class A and B shares, Hong Kong-traded H shares and listings in Singapore and New York.   The first batch of companies, which raised 2.3 billion yuan, or $278 million, in share sales, include Zhejiang NHU, a producer of food additives and health care products, and Zhejiang Jinggong Science Technology, a maker of construction and textile machinery.   Initially, their shares will trade through existing main-board platforms and will be included in the Shenzhen Composite index, according to the exchange's Web site.   The new market will evolve into an independent entity "when the time is ripe," the Web site says.   Companies will be subject to the same regulations, including rules on earnings reports, as main-board stocks. Like other Class A shares, they will be denominated in yuan and open only to domestic investors and a few overseas fund managers approved by China's government.   Li Mingzhong, a spokesman for the Shenzhen exchange, said a second-board index would be created when there were more listed companies.   The board is aimed at companies with a technology focus, the exchange said in a statement on its Web site.   None of the share sales by the first eight companies and 10 more that plan to join them in coming weeks has exceeded 30 million shares. Li, the exchange spokesman, said that was not an explicit limit.

The employees were taken from a state-run cement works in Udaipur district on Tuesday and a search by security forces has brought no clues.  There has been no word from the rebels, who are fighting to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist republic.  In the past, rebels have made abductees attend political and cultural programmes before freeing them.  Thousands of people, including students and teachers across the kingdom, have been taken to remote rebel hideouts and later released after a few days.  About 9,000 people have died in the eight-year struggle between the Maoists and Nepal's security forces.

That's quite a feat for someone who is supposed to have retired.    Controversy number one arose after President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said in an interview in May that the Malaysian and Chinese governments had provided partial funding for his US$5 million oriental-design, 25-bedroom mansion near the capital, Harare. He did not make it clear whether the supply of rare timber for paneling in the mansion, under construction for more than five years, represented the full extent of Malaysia's involvement.   Mugabe's comments sparked a public outcry in Malaysia, and it took Mahathir 15 days to shed some light on the issue, which appeared to have caught the Malaysian government and cabinet unaware.   "Yes, I think we did" supply timber for the mansion, Mahathir finally told reporters on June 10, but added that this was the "usual practice" in promoting Malaysian timber abroad. Mugabe has often said he regards Mahathir as a close friend, and the two men share many similarities, including a strong anti-Western rhetoric that has been undermined by autocratic rule at home.   After Mahathir's admission, Malaysia's opposition parties and public interest groups responded by calling for an immediate probe into the gift of timber.   "Mahathir is also accountable to the public for his action," said P Ramakrishnan, president of the social reform group, Aliran. "He must come clean by providing facts and figures to justify why a guy like Mugabe, who is regarded as a tyrant and a despotic dictator, deserves this 'gift' from Malaysians."    No sen in sight  Barely had the dust settled when Mahathir caught media attention again on June 17. This time, he was widely reported as saying he was "not getting even one sen" from serving as adviser to national petroleum corporation Petronas and national car maker Proton, as well as to the development authorities of two resort islands - Langkawi, off Mahathir's home state of Kedah, and Tioman, off the peninsula's east coast.   He said he was only receiving the pension for serving as prime minister for more than 22 years. This amounted to half of his last-drawn monthly salary of RM20,000 ($5,260), he was reported as saying in the pro-establishment Star, the country's top-selling English-language newspaper.   "I don't get a single sen at all," he said. "I am provided an office by Petronas." Mahathir said he needed to explain this matter because there had been talk that he was receiving huge allowances from these particular firms and agencies, the Star reported.   A day later, Mahathir was forced to "clarify". In a report by Utusan Malaysia, a paper linked to his former party, the ruling United Malays National Organization, Mahathir said he did receive taxable monthly allowances from Petronas after all. "However, the amount he received was totally far off from the hundreds of thousands of ringgit he was alleged to have received," said the report. It was not known who made those allegations and what prompted the about-turn.    Protection payment takes a hit  As if that was not enough, Mahathir stirred up a third hornet's nest when he called for a review of the honorarium of the annual RM10,000 ($2,600) paid by the northern state of Penang to neighboring Kedah for the historical acquisition of Penang Island and the accompanying strip of land on mainland Penang known as Seberang Perai, formerly province Wellesley.   In the late 18th century, Kedah, under the rule of Sultan Abdullah, offered to lease Penang to England's East India Company in return for protection against possible attacks from Siam (now Thailand) and Burma (Myanmar) and future uprisings by his own relatives. English country trader Captain Francis Light representing the East India Company formally took possession of Penang Island in 1786. Seberang Perai was leased to the English in 1800. However, Sultan Abdullah discovered too late that the compensation and the "protection" Kedah was to receive was much less than he had expected.   In calling for a review of the payment, also on June 17, Mahathir said the amount was no longer realistic. "Kedah should ask Penang for a review of the payment," he said. "We must make a demand because with RM10,000, now you can't even buy a house, or else we ask that Penang and Seberang Perai be returned to us," Mahathir said.   Those with longer memories were left puzzled as to why Mahathir was raising this issue now after stepping down last October after 22 years in power. They point out that when a request was made in 1994 for the payment to be increased to RM10 million, Mahathir himself had dismissed it. "The royalty payment is only a condition ... it is history, and we are only continuing with what is history. It has become meaningless," he said then. These critics also point out that subsequent historical events - Kedah becoming part of independent Malaya in 1957 and of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 - had superseded the earlier agreement with the British.    Water under the bridge  In another salvo, Mahathir also said Kedah should think about charging Penang for the raw water it had received for free over the years. He pointed out that Singapore and Malacca state had to pay their neighbor Johor for water "but Kedah, a poor state at that, supplies raw water for free to a rich state like Penang."   In a way, Mahathir's admission of Kedah being poor is an admission of his administration's failure to raise socio-economic conditions in the state, which remains among the poorest in the country. Penang, by contrast, is one of the most developed states, and its Penang Water Authority (PBA) is widely regarded as one of the most efficient, supplying the public with water at a price that is among the cheapest in the country.   It would not have escaped Mahathir's attention that the PBA's exemplary track record has cast other water authorities in the country in an unfavorable light.   "Water has become a commodity and every state government wants to make money from the sale of water," says economist Charles Santiago, who noted that Kedah was also in the midst of privatizing its water resources. Penang, he said, has been profitable in water and "what Mahathir was saying is that since you are profitable you pay for your water."   But Santiago pointed out that the government had played a clear role in providing access to water as an important component of development, resulting in 95% of the Malaysian population having access to affordable, piped water.   Though both Kedah and Penang are governed by the ruling coalition, United Malays National Organization holds the reins in Kedah while its coalition partner, the multi-ethnic but Chinese-dominated Gerakan, leads the Penang government. Gerakan President Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik holds the water portfolio in the federal cabinet, which was previously held by a staunch Mahathir loyalist, Samy Vellu, president of the Malaysian Indian Congress.   These unnecessary controversies are the last things current Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi needs as he seeks to distance himself from his predecessor. It only goes to show that, even in retirement, the former premier has a knack for ruffling feathers, whether international or domestic, and stirring emotions over the lack of transparency and accountability that characterized his administration. Perhaps after more than two decades in power, it was too much to expect Mahathir to lie low and confine himself to sailing, carpentry or horseback riding.   Source;  Asia Times Online Ltd.

       HIGHLIGHTS    SOUTH KOREA – DEFENSE   S Korea cautious on US troop cuts    South Korean officials have responded cautiously to a US proposal to cut by a third its troops based in the country.    Officials said more negotiations were needed, and South Korea needed time to prepare "countermeasures".  China indicated that it welcomed the plan, saying it hoped it would contribute to regional stability. But South Korean opposition, civic groups and analysts said the relatively quick timescale for the pull-out could jeopardise security.   The US has proposed withdrawing 12,500 of its 37,000 troops by 2006.   The US has said it needs to modernise its forces, but the move may leave some South Koreans feeling vulnerable to North Korea.   "There still need to be negotiations," Defence Minister Cho Young-kil said on Tuesday.  "In response to the US-presented broad idea, our idea is also going to prepare a countermeasure in a broad framework," a government official said on condition of anonymity.  "I think the direction of our response will be decided this week after concluding a careful review of the US proposal and collecting various opinions," he said.  The main opposition Grand National Party was less sanguine, calling the US plan "shocking and surprising".  "The number of troops Washington wants to cut came as no surprise, but the timing is rather faster than expected," Professor Kim Tae-hyo at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security told The Korea Herald.   The Pentagon says its commitment to defend the South will not be affected and the use of longer-range weapons and better technology will compensate for the reduction in numbers.  But the South does not want big changes until the resolution of the dispute over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons, says the BBC's correspondent in Seoul, Charles Scanlon. It would prefer the pull-out to happen gradually over 10 years.   Plans are already under way to redeploy the US troops, which will remain in South Korea, and the two sides held a second day of Future of the Alliance talks on that issue in Seoul on Tuesday.   At present nearly half the 37,000 US troops in South Korea are stationed north of Seoul, a throwback to the 1950-53 Korean War.   Their forward position puts them in range of North Korean artillery and US officials have said that pulling troops back south of the capital would strengthen the military's hand.  The US also wants to move the main US army headquarters from its current location in central Seoul to free up money for better military technology and infrastructure.

The figures confirm police reports that demonstrations within China are growing in size and number, and becoming better organised.  The report, in Outlook magazine, blames dissatisfaction with government policy.  The main problems, it says, are wage disputes, social welfare problems, the restructuring of state-owned enterprises, and evictions.  These problems amount to a list of the fallout from China's reform process.  Many protests in China happen far from the public eye, but these figures show they are on the rise.   The Ministry of Public Security says last year there were more than 58,000 "mass incidents" -the term they use to describe public protests - involving three million people: that is an increase of almost 15% over the year before.   Western experts say that as protests increase, Chinese police are trying different strategies to contain them, sometimes even making economic concessions to demonstrators - moves that may even encourage others to stage protests.  And one Western academic has warned that, when it comes to the growing unrest, China's leaders will face riskier dilemmas than at any time since the massive protests in 1989.

The move comes after the communist country sentenced several dissidents to long prison terms over the past two years for using the Internet to criticize the government and promote democracy.  The Ministry of Culture and Information last week instructed the People's Committees in all 64 city and provincial governments to closely monitor all online information, a ministry official said on condition of anonymity. Under the new regulations, part of government policy announced in March, Internet cafe owners can be fined or jailed for allowing clients to download or send "bad information" on the Internet, the official said.  That includes allowing access to sites ranging from those deemed pornographic to those accused of disseminating state secrets. Internet cafe owners must also document what Web sites their clients visit and for how long, and all users must present identification cards before logging on. There are an estimated 5,000 Internet cafes in Vietnam. About 4 million people out of Vietnam's population of 81 million regularly use the Internet.

Labour Regains Voter Support After Budget, TV3 Poll Shows    June 6 (New Zealand's governing Labour party, buoyed by a big-spending budget, regained its lead over the main opposition National party, according to a poll conducted for TV3 News in Auckland.   Voter support for Labour rose to 43 percent from 42 percent in March. National fell to 40 percent from 42 percent, according to the poll results, which were e-mailed to Bloomberg News.   Labour last month pledged NZ$14.1 billion ($8.8 billion) of new spending the next three years aimed at boosting the income of families and encouraging more people into work. The government hasn't led in the TV3 poll since January.  In February, National took the lead in the poll for the first time since October 1996 after leader Don Brash attacked the government for policies he said favor native Maoris over other New Zealanders.   Clark remains most preferred prime minister with 35 percent support from Brash with 26 percent support, according to the TV3 poll of 1,000 voters. The poll was carried out from May 27 to June 3 by Auckland-based TNS and has a margin of error of 3.1 percent.  Separately, consumer confidence was unchanged after falling in March to its lowest since April last year, according to the poll. The proportion of people expecting the economy to improve the next three months was steady at 40 percent. Still, 30 percent expect the economy to deteriorate from 28 percent in March.

The ANZ job ads series, which counts the number of ads in metropolitan newspapers, fell 2.8 per cent in May.  But the drop followed an exceptional year of employment growth and also masked a rise in the use of internet advertising, where ad numbers have risen 51 per cent since May last year. ANZ measured a monthly rise of 3.4 per cent if newspaper and internet ads were measured together. The rival Olivier internet job ads survey recorded a monthly rise of 4.7 per cent. Scott Haslem, an economist with UBS, said forward indicators such as the job ads surveys suggested unemployment would soon fall to its lowest rate since 1981.  Tony Meer, an economist with Deutsche Bank, said Australia, Britain and New Zealand were on the cusp of a historic demographic shift that would create a labour shortage over the next 10 years.   "By the end of this year, or early next year, we'll have an unemployment rate in the low 5s or high 4s," he said. "You have to go back well over three decades ago to find a sustainable unemployment rate below that." Unemployment was last at 5.6 per cent in 1989, before the 1990 recession, but has not fallen consistently below that mark since the mid-1970s. In 1981 the unemployment rate dipped briefly to 5.4 per cent.  Robert Olivier, a director of the Olivier Group recruitment firm, said the labour market was looking increasingly like a sellers' market. "Employers are finding it increasingly difficult to attract top candidates," he said. "It also means there will be pressure on organisations to raise salaries in their June reviews."  Ninety per cent of jobs created in the 12 months to April were full-time, said the federal Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews. He was responding to a report in yesterday's Herald that said more than half of all jobs created in the past 16 years had gone to casual workers, and more than a quarter of workers were employed on a casual basis.  Casuals were "an essential and legitimate part of a flexible labour market", he said, adding that they received loadings of up to 30 per cent above normal wages to compensate for the lack of entitlements. Mr Andrews warned that if a Labor government was elected it would force employers to pay casual workers for sick leave, holidays and redundancies - a move that would force businesses to lay off staff.  Labor's workplace relations spokesman, Craig Emerson, described Mr Andrews's claims as "another Liberal lie".  "Labor policy is to give regular, long-term casuals the choice to request a conversion to permanent employment with employers being able to say no if it's reasonable to do so," he said. Mr Emerson said the ABS definition of full-time work included casual and permanent full-time employees. The most recent ABS survey of casual employment showed almost 45 per cent of new jobs created between August 2002 and August 2003 were casual.

"Yields can rise when the economy is getting better and they can also rise when the credibility of JGBs [Japanese government bonds] is deteriorating," he told journalists. "I do not see the yield rise as negative at all. Rather I see it as a positive sign." On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB rose three basis points to 1.7 per cent, its highest since early 2001 when the Bank of Japan began its current ultra-loose monetary policy.  Mr Takenaka was reacting to investor concern about the danger a sharp rise in long-term interest rates could pose as the economy recovers and as inflationary expectations gradually take hold.  Pessimists worry that rising interest rates could cause problems on a number of fronts, making it harder for the government to service its debt, raising private borrowing costs, and reducing the value of bond holdings held by commercial banks. Hajime Takata, chief strategist of Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, said there was a possibility that long-term interest rates would overshoot, damaging the economy and causing big losses for institutions holding government bonds.  Mr Takata, who has long warned of the dangers of a collapse in the government bond market, said the risks of bond market turbulence became more acute as the economy pulled out of its long deflationary phase.  "This is like a prisoner dilemma situation," he said. "With 97 per cent of government bonds held by Japanese, Japanese people have no way of escaping from the interest rate risk." He said the government should adopt a policy to minimise the risks, issuing more floating-rate bonds and, perhaps, getting the Bank of Japan to buy more long-term JGBs. Peter Tasker, consultant economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said such fears were exaggerated. Bond yields were rising, he said, because the prospects for nominal growth and inflation were improving, precisely what Japan had long been waiting for. Any negative impact caused by falling bond prices, Mr Tasker said, would be more than compensated for by stronger growth and rising equity prices.  Economists said that, even if banks, which have been big purchasers of government bonds, suffered losses on their fixed-income portfolios, they would be able to compensate by gaining wider spreads on lending. Regional banks' balance sheets are more skewed to bonds than the big city banks, which are still big holders of equity.  Economists were also not unduly alarmed at the higher interest rate payment that the government might face on refinancing public debt, now about 140 per cent of gross domestic product. As bond yields rose, so would the tax take, they said. Nonetheless, the government said it remained vigilant against excessive interest rate rises. Sadakazu Tanigaki, finance minister, said: "We need to watch movements in long-term interest rates closely."  Mr Tanigaki also said the ministry would continue to diversify its bond issuance. The government has held two auctions of inflation-linked bonds, both of them heavily oversubscribed.

From the burial sites the walls, oracles and advanced buildings and graves are discovered and the oracles reading "Duke of Zhou (Zhou Gong)" appeared many times there.  After a number of on-site investigations, researches and discussions carried out by many famous archeologists the Western Zhou large burial site has received wide attention and was regarded as belonging quite likely to the family of the Duke of Zhou. This greatest archeological discovery as such ever since the founding of new China proves immeasurably precious to the research on China's civilization and for carrying on and developing China's excellent traditional culture.   The large Western Zhou burial site is located in the ruins of the Duke Zhou Temple in Qishan County of Shaanxi Province. Archeological team composed of Shaanxi Archeology Institute and Peking University, has discovered 19 large graves: nine with four grave tunnels, four with three and two respectively and two with one grave tunnel. There are another 13 funerary pits. Over 700 oracle bone pieces were discovered outside the graves, 420-word oracle identified, four slates with characters reading "Duke of Zhou" ever found, over 1500-meter-long wall and sites of foundations of six large buildings of rammed earth.   After three days of careful investigation Professor Zou Heng from Peking University said, it is the only large community of Zhou people, in which the Western Zhou walls, oracles, advanced buildings were all discovered ever since the archeological activities on the Western Zhou Dynasty were started over 70 years ago. That referring to the Duke of Zhou appeared many times on oracle bones indicates that the site is the feud of Duke Zhou and the burial site belongs to his family. The 78-year-old Zou, dubbed "No.1 archeologist on China's Shang and Zhou dynasties", is the discoverer of the capital ruins of the States of Yan and Jin of the Western Zhou Dynasty and instructor for exploring and excavating Lord Jin's grave of the Western Zhou Dynasty.   Yin Shengping, former curator of Shaanxi History Museum, a noted expert in Western Zhou history, said, king-level graves discovered previously only had one or two tunnels, and it is the first time for us to discover four-grave-tunnel graves in the feud of the Duke Zhou. Duke Zhou was a person honored as King of Zhou and is fully qualified to use the funeral treatment of the highest level. It is no wonder that graves with four tunnels were discovered in his family burial site.   Named Dan and surnamed Ji, Duke Zhou is the founder of Zhou Dynasty, and once assisted King Zhou Wu and afterwards serving as regent for seven years, he gave the power back to King Zhou Cheng. He initiated feudalistic system, and formulated the rites and composed music, thus laid the political and cultural foundation of the Chinese nation. Confucius turned his thought more humanized and worldly, and on the basis he formed the Confucianism, which has been passed on for thousands of years, becoming the most fundamental cultural tradition in Chinese society. "Dreaming of Duke Zhou" still remains a catchword nowadays.   Doctor Zhang Tian'en, director of Shang and Zhou Office of Shaanxi Archeology Institute who devoted for years to seeking tombs for kings of the Western Zhou, held that the title of Duke Zhou is hereditary and lasted for five to six hundred years. Although Zhou Gongdan's eldest son was given the State of Lu in the east but Western Zhou practiced the system of returned burial, i.e. one must be buried in the mother town when he died. As descendents of Duke Zhou given provincial enfeoffment must also be buried in the family graveyards, therefore, many graves appeared with four tomb-tunnels.   Researcher Yuan Zhongyi, former curator of Qinshihuang Terracotta and Horses Museum, said, the size of the four-tunnel graves are generally a bit small, so they are not likely to be of the graves for kings but more likely to be graves of the family of Duke Zhou. As to whom they actually belong, that depends on the final determination after excavation.

The Unicef says as many as 70,000 Indonesian children have been sold across the country's borders as sex commodities. They are employed in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Similarly, nearly half of the 400,000 estimated sex workers in Indonesia are children under 18 years old.  This grim reality has mostly been ignored, buried deep in local newspapers. In this instance, it is the lack of discussion about the problem that is disturbing. That is, until unique cases like the most recent arrest of a 'madam' emerged. Twenty-seven-year-old Arum was arrested last month for operating a network of prostitutes from her humble food stall in a densely populated neighbourhood in South Jakarta. Reports said she had recruited girls, mostly students between the ages of 14 and 16, to work for her by first luring them to buy items from her, on credit. These included mobile phones, clothes and shoes.  When the girls ended up with huge debts, she then made them escort older men. The girls would meet their customers in the daytime, after school, before going home. Arum's case was special, as she did not operate in a typical 'lokalisasi' or red-light district area.  A report by the Jakarta office of the International Labour Organisation-International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (ILO-Ipec) said a large number of children in the country are trapped in the worst forms of child labour, mainly prostitution. These children come from both urban and rural areas. Poverty is the trigger in most cases. Government reports say between three million and six million children had been left, without parental care, to eke out a living after the 1997 economic crisis.  In some rural areas, parents are also known to sell their children for money to recruits for the sex industry.  Yet it is the large cross-border syndicates, which recruit girls through deceptive means, that are running a lucrative business of prostitution and people trafficking in an industry that generates millions of rupiah a year in the country. With the authorities, such as some police and immigration officials, on their payroll, the syndicates target Indonesia as a place for recruitment as well as a destination for sex tourists. Activists point out the government's glaring lack of effort to tackle this problem. The government last year came up with a national plan to combat the trafficking of women and children.  But with a lack of capacity and resources, the plan was criticised as just 'lip service'. For instance, there is no budget to implement the plan.  'If we want to fight organised crime groups that are making a lot of money, we have to be willing to spend some money,' said Mr Aris Merdeka Sirait, the secretary-general of the National Commission on Children Protection, in Jakarta recently. The government has drafted a law that mandates severe punishment for exploiters of children. But the enforcers, either out of lack of knowledge or collusion with the suspects, often ignore the law and prosecute the cases using the regular criminal code. For activists like Mr Aris, nothing is more frustrating than seeing the stacks of cases they submit to the police receive little follow-up.  'We get hundreds of cases and data on child prostitution, but if you'd ask me a year later how many of those have been successfully prosecuted, you'd be disappointed to hear the answer,' he said.  The government only started to act when people began talking about the country's corruption problem. So, until more people start talking about it, this problem of teen prostitutes will see little change.

Yet opinions vary considerably as to how this Divine Will should be actualized.    Cut off from centuries of classical Islamic and legal scholarship, which requires one to understand not just Arabic but the context and evolution of Islamic history in the first place to be able to render a sound juristic verdict, the legal sensibility of Muslims has been severely compromised.   Muslims in Malaysia, not unlike those in the Middle East, have resorted to appreciating Islam through the narrow prism of al Halal wal Haram fil Islam - which means abiding by the "lawful and prohibited acts in Islam", and which is detailed in a book of the same name by Yusuf Qaradawi.   In this philosophy, submission to God is reduced to a series of dos and don'ts - a binary moral code. This approach was systematized by Qaradawi, dean of Islamic law at Qatar University, and the methodology gained currency in the Middle East, and subsequently in Southeast Asia.   Since 1960, when Qaradawi wrote his book in Arabic, his narrow approach toward Islam has predominated. In Malaysia, his influence is deep, even among the governing Muslim elites. When former deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim was the president of the International Islamic University, Malaysia, he spent considerable time with Qaradawi, expressing his support for the latter's fiqh al aliyyah (introducing Islamic law according to priorities).   In his governmental post of deputy to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar was able to bring some of Qaradawi's ideas into public policy. Eventually Anwar was dumped from the government and jailed on charges of sodomy and corruption; however, the thoughts and practice of Qaradawi have not been totally excluded from government policy, including the reductionist elements.   Islamic scholars and thinkers in Malaysia continue to look to Qaradawi for various Islamic interpretations and verdicts, such as on the legality of suicide terrorism. More important, the inspiration of Qaradawi is integral to the conceptual blueprint for an Islamic state as held by the opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), which controls the Kelantan state government.  PAS's Islamic state is based on the permissible and the prohibited as outlined by Qaradawi. Observe the "Islamic state document" produced by PAS last year, the first of its kind in the history of the party, after much demand from Malaysians as to what a PAS-style Islamic state would actually represent.   In this document, it was clearly stated that PAS would implement "the Shariah [Islamic law] to achieve the five imperatives of the Shariah; therein to protect a Muslim's beliefs, life, intellect, dignity and property".   In seeking to fulfill these five imperatives, the document read: "In implementing the Shariah all vices and crimes that pertain to the above stated aspects would be controlled. Man-made laws have been [proved] a failure in securing the security and dignity of the human race."   From this line of reasoning, it is clear that punitive logic is not far from the implementation of Shariah as envisaged by PAS.   In fact, despite promising to keep true to the five objectives, what is known as Maqasid al-Shariah, PAS is totally silent on the jurisprudential methodology and tradition that would be employed on how these objectives can be fulfilled.   Yet anyone who is vaguely informed on Shariah is aware that the recourse to different methods or schools of thought on Shariah - whether it be mazhab Shafii (as is customary in Malaysia and Indonesia) or mazhab Maliki (as is common in Northern Africa) - can produce variations to each law.   PAS stated that the reason for the creation of an Islamic state is a Fardhu Ain (necessary Islamic obligation). To justify the creation of an Islamic state, PAS quoted the Islamic maxim: "Something becomes obligatory if an obligatory injunction fails to be fulfilled without it."   Going by the above assertion, Islamic law, in the words of M B Hooker, an Islamic-law specialist based in Australian National University, is a creature of "executive institution", something that the Islamic state must create.   Hence, rather than based on Islamic scholasticism, where religious scholars debate on each point of law before it is deployed or introduced, it is now the Islamic state that will decide how Islamic laws are best made.   It is in this context that Parvez Manzoor, a Muslim scholar based in Stockholm University, argues that the Islamic state can become an "all-watchful Hegelian state". This is because it carries within it the administrative, theological and bureaucratic reach, to sanction and approve every mode of behavior.   How one practices Islam in Malaysia, according to PAS, should boil down to observing the prescriptions (the dos) and proscriptions (the don'ts) of the Islamic state, and the kind of restrictive Shariah conceived by it. Therefore, the intermingling of men and women is banned, as are art events deemed offensive.   Although Islamists inspired by the clarity of Qaradawi's work often point to the validity of his approach, since there is a phrase in the Koran that encourages Muslims "to advocate virtue and forbid vice", they fail to note that even Qaradawi himself openly acknowledged the difficult and unprecedented nature of reducing Islam to a set of positive and negative deeds.   That this warning is not heeded is largely due to a shallow understanding of Islamic history, combined with even poorer understanding of Islamic law, and the methods with which laws are derived.   In seeking to create an Islamic state to police and punish, the very position of Islam itself is made controversial, especially in a modern and multiracial society such as Malaysia, where up to half of the population are non-Muslims.   Due to the tendency to assume that a punitive Islamic state is the norm, when Islamists in Malaysia do propose a legislative agenda, they are often predisposed to an approach that rarely questions the spirit and ethics laden in Shariah to satisfy the five imperatives.   Rather, the jurisprudence is based on sanctions and injunctions of the Islamic faith, which in fact is the most simplistic, if not crudest, rendition of Islam into contemporary context.   Herein lies the irony in Malaysia: Despite the clarion call of PAS to create an Islamic society guided by moral awareness, the current approach dilutes it. Instead, it is heavily tilted toward creating an all-powerful Islamic state rather than one fostered on ethical precepts.  Nevertheless, it remains PAS's contention that an Islamic state must come into existence first before an ethical Islamic society could come to be. Morality, in other words, comes after power.   Although the ruling party of Malaysia, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), is arguably "softer" on the importance of Islamic state, even its Islamization program is not without punitive elements, in some cases even on par with PAS. Islamic laws passed by states ruled by UMNO have been just as strong and harsh.   The only way out for Malaysia is for scholars and students of Islam to be more sensitive to the context of Islamic history, rather than to adopt it wholesale, as is the preferred approach in Islamic institutes and universities thus far. Unless Islamists in Malaysia combine a perceptive reading of Islamic history and Islamic jurisprudence, the reliance on a punitive approach will continue to predominate.

       HIGHLIGHTS    CHINA - GEOPOLITICA   China approves changes to draft resolution on Iraq    China has welcomed modifications to a draft resolution on Iraq made by the United States and Britain.  The Chinese government says it hopes the United Nations Security Council can reach a consensus on a resolution at an early date, to stabilise the security situation in Iraq and promote the process of reconstruction.  The draft resolution would give international backing both to a caretaker Iraqi government and the US-led multinational force that will remain in the country after June 30. The latest version outlines a rough timeline for US-led troops to leave Iraq "upon completion of the political process" to create a constitutionally elected Iraqi government. France and Russia - who along with the US, Britain and China are permanent members of the Security Council - have voiced reservations about the modified draft resolution.

In a strongly worded statement issued on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the June 4 incident, Amnesty says those found responsible should be tried and brought to justice. The London-based organisation is also calling on the government to release all those who are still held in connection with the Tiananmen crackdown and who never received fair trials. The group has records of more than 50 people it believes remain imprisoned in China for their part in the protests. It says this represents a fraction of the true figure, never released by Chinese authorities.

The poll suggests former cabinet minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono could snatch a victory by gaining more than 50 per cent in the first round of voting. Our Indonesia correspondent, Tim Palmer, reports the poll, conducted by the Japanese LSI agency across Indonesia, suggests the momentum behind Mr Yudhoyono, known as SBY, continues to grow. The poll gives Mr Yudhoyono 49.8 per cent of the vote - close to the simple majority needed to sweep the election at the first round.  President Megawati trails by more than 30 per cent and now appears locked in a battle for second place with former general, Wiranto, of the Golkar party.  The poll shows both have about 14 per cent of the vote. A second placed candidate would head into a second round election in September if no candidate wins more than 50 per cent in the first poll.

In a report to a meeting of international aid donors, the World Bank says despite a recent fall in poverty levels, more than half the population still lives on less than $US2 a day. The World Bank says services to the poor are among the worst in the region. Unemployment rose to 9.3 percent last year and some two-thirds of the jobless were aged 15-24.  Indonesia's maternal mortality rate is twice as great as in the Philippines and five times greater than Vietnam. The report says severe malnutrition among infants had increased from 6.3 percent in 1989 to eight percent in 2002.

The first four cases of HIV infection were reported in 1989 - by December 2003, there were 142. Mr Naivalu says there could be as many as 4,000 unreported HIV infections based on the rate of increase between 2001 and 2002. He says the disease in Fiji is displaying trends experienced by countries that are now undergoing catastrophic problems.  Mr Naivalu predicts there will be more deaths, increased poverty and more orphans. He says a wide range of social, economic and cultural factors have led to an environment in which risky sexual behaviour is widespread He was speaking to delegates at the Seventh Commonwealth Women's Affairs Ministers meeting in Nadi.

The five aid workers were killed on Wednesday in a gun attack on their vehicle in Baghdis province in northwest Afghanistan. The victims have been identified as a Belgian woman, a Dutchman, a Norwegian man, and two Afghan men. A spokeswoman for MSF says the agency's activities will be suspended nationwide. She says there is no clear motive for the killing or any indication of who was behind the murders.

Red Cross officials say an unknown number of people are missing from the cyclone - the worst to hit the coastal communities of Rakhine state in nearly 40 years.  The aid agency is set to launch an international appeal for the cyclone victims, which it expects to raise about $US120.000. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said recently Burma had made a surprise plea for international assistance after the cyclone, which struck on May 19 but was not reported until last week. The AFP news agency says Burma's military government is known for under-reporting natural disasters and accidents and rarely seeks foreign help. UNICEF has already begun relief missions to the affected area.

King Gyanendra sacked the prime minister two years ago for alleged incompetence and took charge of government, sparking massive pro-democracy protests. Opposition parties and Maoist insurgents have been demanding that King Gyanendra accept an 18-point plan to limit his powers - or face the abolition of the monarchy.   Presenter/Interviewer:  Mike Woods   Speakers:  Dr Chitra Tiwari, independent analyst and Nepal specialist   TIWARI: You know his options are very limited and offers are running out. He probably will have to strike some sort of deal with the parties because parties are also getting more support from international agencies, even you know India, United States, Great Britain, Australia and othe countries. They say that the political parties must come together as a pre requisite you know to peace with the Maoists in the future. So if the King does not listen to these ideas.... to these opinions probably he might be in danger in the days to come.  WOODS: THe political alliance containing the five parliamentary parties have submitted an 18-point road map limiting the King's power, calling for transparency from the Royal household. The King either accepts that or sees the monarchy abolished. Wouldn't his advisers be telling him that some monarchy is better than no monarchy at all?  TIWARI: Well I would think so but again remember the Nepal is declared as a Hindu kingdom and I am of the opinion that you know in Hindu, monarchy and constitutional monarchy are two different concepts...they can't go together but somehow the people are making that mistake there. A Hindu monarch does not receive his powers from the constitution but he receives his powers from the religious texts.  WOODS: What sort of guarantee does the Alliance...the Political Alliance have, that should a republic come to fruition, that the Maoists would participate in a democratic republic and not see a bigger prize...that being more power?  TIWARI: They have been telling the parties that they would abide by the spirit of the competitive politics and they would participate in politics along with other parties in the event Nepal is declared a republic. But you know as a revolutionary party...as a party you know that led the republican movement, I would think that they would definitely have some say...they would definitely you know emerge as the largest party in the new set up. But given the international situation. given the you know antipathy towards you know Maoists coming from India and from other countries, the Maoists will have to make some adjustment with the political forces... with the political parties, so I believe they cannot do away the multi-party system there even if they want to.  WOODS: Do you believe that the monarchy can survive in Nepal? And if so how quickly must the King move to ensure that survival?  TIWARI: I think you know he can still survive there if he agrees you know for the change in the constitution.... a constitution you know that will be approved by the assembly. You know the election to constitute assembly does not mean necessarily that it is against the monarchy. You know once you have elections you know the tide could go anywhere.... to any side. So still you know the King has a place there, he will have time you know to bargain with the republicans. If he does that he will survive, if not if he goes into confrontation with the political parties on the one hand and the Maoists on the other then I'm afraid his future is bleak.

In a surprise result, the opposition Union for Democracy won 27 seats in last month's Assembly elections, against 28 seats for the ruling Tahoeraa party of President Gaston Flosse. Now the opposition coalition has won the support of two minor parties, gaining a one-seat majority in the Assembly. With such a tight result, the fate of the Flosse government is still uncertain.    Presenter/Interviewer:  Nic Maclellan   Speakers:  Jean-Marc Regnault, University of French Polynesia, Tahiti  MACLELLAN: With 29 seats in French Polynesia's 57-seat Assembly, the opposition Union for Democracy hopes to form a new government.  This coalition unites pro-independence parties - Oscar Temaru's Tavini Huiraatira and Jacqui Drollet's Ia Mana Te Nunaa - together with autonomy parties like Here Ai'a, Emile Vernaudon's Ai'a Api and the trade union O Oe To Oe Rima.  Now the opposition has gained support from Nicole Bouteau, a former government minister, and Philip Schyle, President of the autonomy party Fetia Api.  Jean-Marc Regnault, lecturer at the University of French Polynesia in Tahiti, says the opposition's electoral success was unexpected.  REGNAULT: "I think that the surprise was immense on all sides. Only a few activists close to the independence party seriously thought they might win.  "I think that amongst the political leadership and outside commentators, no one was expecting it.  "Even the general public was surprised, because at the start of counting, the results came from the outer islands - the Australs, the Marquesas and the Tuamotus - where Gaston Flosse won a significant majority. So no one thought it was possible for him to lose.  "When the final results were tallied, it completely astounded those who won and those who lost."  MACLELLAN: Except for a brief period in the early 1990s, President Gaston Flosse and his Tahoeraa party have governed French Polynesia for over twenty years.   President Flosse has long been supported by his political ally French President Jacques Chirac, who held a France-Oceania summit in Tahiti last July.  But Jean-Marc Regnault believes that there is a mood for change amongst ordinary Tahitians.  REGNAULT: "There's a very deep gulf between the government and the political elite who benefit from being in government, and the vast bulk of the population who don't benefit from the current set-up.  "The public seemed a bit irritated with a leader who seems just too sure of himself, and also seeing the French President visit here last July as if he was entering a conquered nation.   "There was also the issue that the President had organised for the winning electoral ticket to get a bonus of 33 per cent of the seats. For many citizens voting here, this seemed a bit like over-kill, as if Gaston Flosse was too sure of his victory.   "This desire to crush the opposition seem to create a mobilisation amongst the people to give a lesson to Gaston Flosse."   MACLELLAN: Both President Flosse and independence activist Oscar Temaru have announced that they will be candidates for the Presidency to be decided on June 10. But with just one seat difference in the Assembly, the Union for Democracy will need to guarantee support from all its members.  This week, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff stated that the post-election transition should be managed without any violence, an indication of concern that opposition activists might protest if President Flosse returns to power.  Jean-Marc Regnault says that people are waiting quietly for events to unfold.   REGNAULT: "Until now, the country has been surprisingly calm. You might have thought the victors would celebrate their victory, or start issuing demands that they want this or that.  "But there's been none of this. The country is very calm, with people happy to discuss amongst themselves the events that are unfolding.   "But as people have expressed a desire for change, and if this was thwarted by a political manoeuvre, it would certainly be unacceptable for a certain number of activists.   "Even though as a university academic I can't be partisan, it's clear that Gaston Flosse manipulated the elections - through the short electoral campaign and the bonus seats for the winners, he clearly tried to manipulate the result.  "So it would be extraordinary if, after having lost the vote, he now tried to change the results by buying one or two members of the opposition."   MACLELLAN: Jean-Marc Regnault stresses that President Flosse has not yet given up the fight.  REGNAULT: "Since yesterday, Gaston Flosse has made a number of statements that are extremely worrying for democracy. He's announced that he's trying to have the elections annulled, based on pretexts that have got no validity.   "He's also made some very serious statements. He said that he's held a discussion with France's Overseas Minister and that France will no longer give money to French Polynesia if the independence movement takes power.  "There are two options: either the Minister really said this, which would be really serious because France respects the rule of law and should accept an election result. This would be an intervention by the French State that is unusual, or even illegal, I would say.

        HIGHLIGHTS    INDIA – BUSINESS – TECHNOLOGY   Microsoft building for first time in India    Microsoft continues to extend its presence in India: no longer content only to lease space,  Microsoft has acquired its first plot of land in Hyderabad with plans to construct a three-building complex that will house at least 1,000 employees. While Microsoft portrayed the move as "thoughtful and deliberate," other industry insiders described it as a "wake-up call" for Microsoft’s 27,000 employees in the Seattle area:  "Every employee Microsoft hires overseas means they're placing an employee at Redmond in direct competition with someone that makes a fraction of their wage." Whether these fears are "overblown" or not, the fact remains that big-name U.S. technology companies continue to establish a permanent presence in India as part of a broader cost-cutting strategy.

Most Pacific states and nations with major tuna fishing fleets have ratified a new Pacific tuna convention, to take effect on 19 June.  The Honiara-based fisheries agency was set up a quarter of a century ago by Pacific Island Forum members to exercise greater control over their combined fishing resources.  But with a new commission to oversee the convention soon to be established in the Federated States of Micronesia, the agency is re-examining its role.  At the agency's annual board meeting in Kiribati last week, Forum government officials agreed to accelerate the development a new strategic plan.  That plan will include helping Pacific island nations meet their obligations under the convention. The agency also reported that staff working conditions in Honiara had improved dramatically since the arrival of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, RAMSI, and last July.

Singapore dealers say, in early trade, the benchmark New York light sweet crude for July was at $US40.38 a barrel, up from $US39.88 at the close of trading in the United States on Friday. The AFP news agency says with the US markets closed for a public holiday on Monday, the hike in Asian trading is the first indication of heightened fears about a disruption to world oil supplies following the weekend attacks in Saudi Arabia. Suspected al Qaeda militants killed 22 people, including 19 foreigners, in the attacks at oil company offices and a housing complex in the eastern Saudi city of al Khobar. The al Khobar attack is the second in a month on a hub of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter. The surge in oil prices comes despite Saudi Arabia issuing assurances after the al Khobar attack that supplies would not be affected.

The approval paves the way for the enactment of the legislation. Kyodo news agency says the new legislation will give the government a second tool to press North Korea to resolve the abduction and other issues. It follows February's revisions to the foreign exchange law to enable the government to impose economic sanctions without United Nations authorization. North Korea has admitted its agents kidnapped at least 13 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s. While many have been allowed to return home, Tokyo wants a proper investigation into the Cold War abductions. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, its coalition partner, the New Komeito party, and the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan reached an agreement last month to pass the bill, and make it a special law, so it can be abolished in line with changes in the international situation.

In both Beijing and Shanghai real estate is the hottest investment around, and official warnings of bursting property bubbles are to no avail.   Presenter/Interviewer:  James Panichi   Speakers:  Scott Barrack, SPACE director; Guy Hollis, China country head, Jones Lang   LaSalle; Bernie Shuttleworth, ANZ senior economist  PANICHI: Shanghai's heritage flats and houses were built between the 1800s and 1950, and feature hardwood floors and European-style high ceilings. Not surprisingly, they've become a prime target of the insatiable appetites of property investors. Scott Barrack is the director of SPACE, a Shanghai real estate agency.   BARRACK: The first people to go in and really starting buying these things were the local Chinese, but that was driven indirectly or directly by the fact that three or four years ago you had an influx of westerners into Shanghai, who were coming here on expat packages and wanted these old places. Recently now, people have started to feel a little more comfortable with foreigners and now you've got, I'd say, half western and half Chinese who are purchasing these, primarily for the purpose of investment, a little bit more now for individual living.  PANICHI: So, clearly the demand for these houses is on the rise, but to what extent are prices also rising?   BARRACK: Quite significantly. About two and a half years ago, when we first starting getting in the sales market, I purchased a property and a friend of mine purchased a property at the same time and we both paid about US$ 1,000 a square metre. Now, these same properties at the moment... well, I know one of them is for sale for US$ 3,000 plus a square metre. And that's in about two, two and a half years.   PANICHI: In other words, property investments in mainland China continue to boom. In fact, both Beijing and Shanghai are now selling over 20 million square metres of real estate each year. That's in spite of a raft of government measures to dampen enthusiasm, including raising the equity requirement for bank loans from 10 to 30 per cent. According to some observers, the problem is that the growth of city populations appears to be unstoppable. Guy Hollis is China country head for property consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle.   HOLLIS: Property is something that all Chinese seem to love and people are very keen. But the government have got a problem here, in as much as there's mass urbanisation going on China in the moment and the figures that are published -- and these aren't government figures, they're not our figures, they are actually from the European Commission on mortgages -- and they say something like 340 million Chinese are going to urbanise in the next 25 to 30 years, which is roughly the population of the United States. So, that bottom end of the market -- they've got to keep building into that market. And the government give tax-breaks to developers, they give incentives to developers and they also give tax incentives to buyers to buy into that market because that's the mass-market. So, while you slow down the economy, they've got to keep providing housing at that end. The bit they want to stop is developers building speculative schemes at the top-end of the market.   PANICHI: But the value of commercial properties, as well as that top end of the residential market, continues to grow. And the phenomenon may be spreading. In Hong Kong, the property market appears to have woken from its slumber. In the first land auction for 20 months, local developers snapped up two public sites for a total of US$ 380 million -- well above the reserve price. And because investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan are playing a large part in Shanghai's property boom, the previously disparate Chinese markets now appear closer than ever. But does that mean Hong Kong property prices will start to look increasingly like the prices of Shanghai? Guy Hollis.   HOLLIS: I don't know. I mean, Hong Kong is a different market. It's a small, enclosed market and it tends to work in smaller cycles. Shanghai works on more traditional cycles, more five-to-ten-year cycles, it seems to be, as it is maturing. But what is driving Shanghai is the foreign, direct investment and all the industrial growth that's bringing all of the jobs in and around Shanghai and Shanghai is becoming the financial centre for China, which is the Chinese government's policy.   PANICHI: So, on the one hand government policy has to reflect the need for residential developments in Shanghai, while on the other it has to drag an economic growth rate of around 9 per cent - to which the property market contributes - back down to more manageable levels. The good news is that if the market is substantially overvalued -- as many observers believe it is -- a sudden downturn may not have a lasting economic impact. Bernie Shuttleworth is a senior economist with Australia's ANZ Bank.   SHUTTLEWORTH: The bubble is in prices of new, luxury apartments that are largely targeted at investors, many of them from outside China, from places like Hong Kong and Taiwan. Now, if that bubble bursts, the investors will be hurt, the property developers will be hurt and it could very easy add to the bad debt situation of the banks. But bear in mind that the major banks are all government owned, and in a sense it's on the government's balance sheet and I don't think that would lead to a banking collapse.

      INDONESIA - INTERNAL SECURITY   Bomb blast shakes Indonesian election commission    A bomb has exploded in the offices of Indonesia's election commission just before officials were due to announce the result of this month's presidential election.   No one is believed to have been injured and there has been no serious damage.  Police say the explosion damaged a women's toilet on the first floor of the central Jakarta offices. The blast occured while most people were attending prayers. The building was then evacuated. Until now there had been no incidents of violence throughout Indonesia's parliamentary or presidential elections.  Electoral officials were already running behind schedule in their attempts to announce the final count of the first-round presidential elections.  They were evacuated from the building and the counts suspended officials have only one province to recount before announcing the result. With about 85 per cent of the vote counted, ex-general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had 34 per cent of the vote, compared with 26 per cent for the incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri and 22 per cent for another ex-general, Wiranto.

In a state of the nation address, President Arroyo admitted the most urgent problem is a big budget deficit. The president identified five key points of her new government program: job creation; anti-corruption measures; social justice; education, and energy independence. In her address Ms Arroyo asked the Philippine congress to pass new tax measures to cut the ballooning budget deficit.  President Arroyo also mentioned her government's foreign policy, which she said focussed on protecting the vital interests of the nation, including the eight-million overseas Filipino workers.  She said this led to the safe release of Filipino Angelo de la Cruz from his Iraqi captors.

Runoff from heavy downpours in the provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi is moving down the Yangtze to Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. Flood crests in Wuhan are expected to surpass warning levels. Officials in Hubei are urging workers to be on guard against potential floods and to reinforce all reservoirs, dykes and embankments. In Jiangsu province, China's third largest river, the Huaihe, has caused reservoirs to overflow, sending industrial waste downstream and creating a 30-kilometre belt of contamination. In the province of Yunnan, bordering Vietnam, at least 36 people have died this month in floods, landslides and mudflows. Army helicopters are trying to deliver supplies to Yingjiang County.

Entrepreneur and businessman Tony Fernandes and Malaysia's AirAsia are already shaking up the region's airline industry with a simple concept - everyone should be able to fly. The fledgling carrier is a huge success story, in a region that had only one low-cost airline five years ago. Now there are 13 budget airlines in existence or about to launch, including Virgin Blue, Valuair, Tiger Airways and One-Two-Go. AirAsia expects to carry nearly eight million passengers next year, almost double the estimate for this year. Fernandes puts his success down to a hands-on approach. "It was strange when I first came to the airline. The pilots freaked out because they suddenly saw their CEO pushing the ladder (to the plane)," Fernandes told CNN. "The pilots cannot get over the fact that I have a cup of coffee with the guys who carry the bags. My secretary will (even) go out and help clean the planes if we are running into a delay." Three years ago Fernandes had no involvement with airlines whatsoever. As a Warner Music executive in New York, he hobnobbed with celebrities from across the world. But after a decade in the music industry, he decided to pursue his childhood dream - running an airline. "On the way back to London, I saw easyJet on the television. I thought this looked interesting," says Fernandes. "So I went up to Luton airport and spent two days there watching easyJet in action. I talked to staff and passengers - and thought, right, this is something I want to do." Without any prior experience, Fernandes and some close associates purchased Malaysia-based AirAsia in 2001. The airline had been struggling for a number of years. It was operating to only two domestic destinations and was heavily in debt. Three years ago, Air Asia was relaunched as a budget airline and now flies to Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Macau. Last year it made a profit of $5.3 million and expects to do substantially better this year. The company is also planning a $200 million initial public offering in September or October this year. Fernandes believes the open culture at the airline has driven growth. "There is tremendous camaraderie here - with no hierarchy and a family environment. We cannot ever change that. As soon as we change it we will lose our focus," he says. "We have marketing and finance people, engineers, cabin crew and pilots all in one office. It means effective communication. You open the office door and you see our planes. If people need help, we all go out there and carry bags (on to the plane)." He also believes that Asia's budget carriers are opening up the travel market to a new generation of consumers. Hong Kong, the second busiest airport in Asia, now faces fresh competition from nearby Macau. AirAsia started flying to the former Portuguese territory on July 5, saying that Hong Kong's airport fees were too expensive.

The Federal Government announced last year that it would spend more than $100 million subsidising broadband services for regional and remote Australia under the HiBIS program. Communications Minister Helen Coonan has announced today that three companies have registered under the scheme and two more, including Telstra, have approval to do so. Telstra says more than 106,000 customers in 99 towns, most in rural areas, will now gain access to broadband ADSL services for the first time. The 99 towns selected are those with the highest registered demand for ADSL services. "More affordable broadband, in line with prices available in metropolitan areas, will now be available for rural, regional and remote Australia, helping businesses and individuals living in those areas stay connected," Senator Coonan said in a statement.  Other firms approved to start providing broadband services under HiBIS are:   - Canberra-based RBBS, which will provide two-way satellite services in high-cost areas across Australia; - DCS Internet, which will provide wireless broadband services in eastern Victoria; - E-wire, which will provide cable modem services in parts of WA's south-west; and - Wideband Services, which will provide wireless broadband services in eastern Victoria.

Nippon Keidanren, the Japan Business Federation, has proposed reviews of restrictions regarding arms exports as well as the principle of the peaceful use of outer space.  Its thinking is that, with the development and shared use of cutting-edge arms technology being advanced beyond national borders, to allow Japan to become isolated in such an era runs the risk of its lagging behind in weapons capability. This is seen as an impediment to national security.  Nippon Keidanren is clearly apprehensive of any change in military threats to Japan and of the economic situation, which it considers to be the cause of a continued decline in arms procurement by the Self-Defense Forces. It, therefore, feels that the future of the arms industry may be in peril.  To date, Nippon Keidanren has twice proposed changes in the three arms-export principles, which prohibit exports to former communist bloc nations, countries under U.N. arms embargoes and those involved in, or likely to be involved in, international conflict.  Within the government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as well, last year's Cabinet decision to introduce a missile defense system prompted work aimed at revising those principles. The goal of this latest proposal, obviously, lies in advancing that trend.  In Europe, there is increasing development of military technology and joint use of arms involving collaboration between industrialized nations. This is also true of the Japan-U.S. missile defense development project, which under the present approach promises to lead to supply of parts to the United States. Under the current rules, however, such transactions are banned.  We earnestly question, however, if actual conditions are grounds for modifying the three principles.  It has been nearly four decades since they were adopted. The benefits to the global community during those years, of Japan's trust and reputation as a ``peaceful nation,'' are immeasurable. Though Japan has often been said to lack a clear foreign policy, it has maintained its ability to speak out on the fields of arms control and disarmament.  It would be tragic to ignore the arms export restrictions in the future. Yohei Kono, speaker of the House of Representatives and veteran LDP legislator, has criticized the Nippon Keidanren proposal, labeling it ``a threat to Japan's very presence in the international community.'' We could not agree with him more.  The business world is also concerned that failure to enter joint development of state-of-the-art armaments will cause Japan to fall behind in other areas of technological development, which would affect demand for consumer goods. We strongly suggest, however, that equal attention be devoted to the downside of making changes in long-help principles of national behavior.  In terms of missile defense, questions remain about how effective the deployment of such a system would be. On this front, it will be vital to proceed with a close eye on the linkage with the situation surrounding North Korea's nuclear development program. Under current conditions, we cannot support hasty changes in arms commitment.  Within the ranks of Nippon Keidanren, there appear to be certain factions with an interest in moving into broad-ranging exports of munitions, other than the advanced technologies.  During calendar 2003, worldwide military expenditures totaled $880 billion, up about 20 percent from a decade ago. In a growth market of this caliber, ``made in Japan'' weapons might sell well. Such business dealings, however, represent a clear step down the dark road to becoming a reviled ``merchant of death.''  Nippon Keidanren head Hiroshi Okuda, also chairman of Toyota Motor Corp., has used the avenue of private sector business to help build Toyota into one of the world's super blue-chip companies. While Nippon Keidanren membership also includes companies in the defense business, we see no need to bow to their every commercial interest.  The forward of the Nippon Keidanren Charter of Corporate Behavior, a document prepared under the auspices of Okuda himself, reads, ``Members should contribute to the sound development of society by supplying quality products and services and in doing so, members must reinforce the importance of business ethics.''  We hope that Nippon Keidanren will keep this noble commitment uppermost in mind, and play its part in helping to chart the course to a future for Japan   Source;  The Asahi Shimbun, July 04   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   KAZAKHSTAN - POLITICAL AFFAIRS   To tout reform, Nazarbayev uses opposition minister    President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s surprise appointment of moderate opposition leader Altynbek Sarsenbayev as minister of information has raised expectations for a comparatively free and fair parliamentary ballot in Kazakhstan this September.   Sarsenbayev, who is co-chairman of the centrist opposition party Ak Zhol (Bright Path), was named to the post on July 12 after apparently securing assurances from President Nazarbayev that he would carry through with a political reform initiative announced last month at a congress of the pro-presidential Otan (Fatherland) Party.   "He guaranteed that the elections would take place honestly and openly, in accordance with the country’s legislation," Sarsenbayev told a July 13 press conference in Almaty. In a July 15 interview with the newspaper Vremya, Sarsenbayev stressed that he had "laid out to the president the position of our party and the democratic forces" on all questions concerning the upcoming elections.   At the Otan congress, Nazarbayev had declared that the September 19 ballot would serve as a "test" for the country’s commitment to political reform. He spoke out in favor of a ministerial cabinet that reflected the political composition of parliament and for parliament to play a greater role in determining the make-up of the Central Election Commission and Constitutional Council. Such concepts have long been championed by Ak Zhol and other opposition groups.   At a July 21 meeting with media executives, Nazarbayev renewed calls for a free-and-fair vote. “We must hold transparent, honest and legitimate elections,” the Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency quoted Nazarbayev as saying. “Press freedom must be subordinate to public interests.”  Though this is the fourth time he has served as information minister, Sarsenbayev’s appointment surprised many analysts. A former ambassador to Russia and close confidante of Nazarbayev, Sarsenbayev had in more recent times been one of the government’s most outspoken critics. Last autumn, after warning that family-run political dynasties had no place in Kazakhstan, Sarsenbayev resigned as the country’s ambassador to Moscow. Named the co-chairman of Ak Zhol in November 2003, he had since become the target of an information campaign believed to have been organized by presidential advisor Ermukhamet Ertysbaev.   Sarsenbayev’s appointment appears to be part of an on-going presidential election strategy. Over the past several months, Nazarbayev and his daughter, Dariga, leader of the pro-presidential party Asar, have consistently incorporated opposition ideas into their own policies and campaign proposals. Recently, this tactic was put to most noticeable use in March during debate over the election reform bill. A similar about-face occurred in April, when Nazarbayev vetoed a restrictive media law also criticized by his daughter, Dariga.   Sarsenbayev indicated that he sees himself as a mediator in an existing feud between government and non-state-controlled media in Kazakhstan. Existing tension between the press and government, Sarsenbayev noted in his press conference, stem "from the negative disposition of the authorities themselves. Therefore, my strategic aim as minister is the removal of the negative insistence on conflict [with the press] within the government itself. The economic conditions in our country allow us to live peacefully. Therefore, we should change the psychology of our relations."   One of the latest clashes involved a forged edition of the opposition paper Assandi Times. The paper, and a sympathetic publication, Navigator, an online journal financed by the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan party, charged that the government had planned the forgery in a bid to discredit the opposition. Under threat of a lawsuit, Navigator apologized for making the claim.   However, government-media tension has increased again in recent days, fueled in part by the death of a Navigator editor, Askhat Sharipzhanov, stemming from a traffic accident in Almaty. Some Kazakhstani media outlets have said the circumstances surrounding the incident are suspicious, prompting speculation that Sharipzhanov was murdered.   At least in theory, opposition viewpoints could gain a wider hearing under Sarsenbayev’s new media policy. The minister has told reporters that he planned to guarantee that all political parties are given the standard 15 minutes on television and 10 minutes on radio as specified by law.   This issue could prove important to the fate of the opposition in the parliamentary ballot since Asar draws its strength in large part from the extensive media properties owned by Dariga Nazarbayeva, including Khabar, the country’s largest television network. Opposition groups have complained that the majority of news programming on Khabar is given over to coverage of the pro-government movements, Asar and Otan. In an attempt to deflect such criticism, Nazarbayeva has suspended her role as head of Khabar from July 1 until  September 30, after the conclusion of the elections.  Sarsenbayev has also stated that he would help draft a new media law designed to better protect journalists’ rights. In recent years, international human rights and media monitoring organizations have expressed concern with lawsuits, harassment and physical abuse targeted against independent journalists. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. The pro-government Kazakhstanskaya Pravda reported Sarsenbayev as saying that the revised media law would act as a stop-gap measure to end such attacks.   But the prospective bill would go beyond defense of journalist rights. Sarsenbayev also foresees a shake-up of the country’s media market. "Indeed, it isn’t a secret that the majority of media are registered not under the names of their true owners, but under false names and companies. I propose that this become one of the main directions of work for the Ministry of Information in the near future,” Sarsenbayev told reporters. “Besides that, we should develop a competitive environment for the creation and development of new [media] companies."   Already Sarsenbayev has put his statements on media rights to work. The day after his appointment, the new information minister recalled government lawsuits against the independent newspapers Nachnyom s Ponedelnika, Delovaya Nedelya and Turkistan, arguing that they lacked merit. In an unusual show of official contrition, Deputy Minister Ardak Doszhan later made an official apology to Nachnem s Ponedelnika.  At the same time, though, the opposition’s political powers remain relatively checked. Otan and Asar, the country’s two largest political parties, are poised to dominate the country’s election committees - a key consideration given misgivings raised during past elections about the objectivity of these committees.   For now, many local observers see the ultimate test of Nazarbayev’s commitment to free and fair elections in 2004 as whether or not equal access on Khabar will be granted to opposition parties, including Ak Zhol, the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan. If so, they say, Nazarbayev will have demonstrated his commitment to true democratic reform. For Sarsenbayev, the test case is no less challenging. Once "correct relations" have been established between the government and media, he said, he will be ready to resign. "I trust that I will be Kazakhstan’s last information minister."

      TIMOR LOROSAE – INTERNAL AFFAIRS   Former E. Timor governor to start jail term Friday over 1999 atrocities    A former East Timor governor who was convicted of human rights abuses during the territory's bloody 1999 breakaway from Indonesia will begin serving a three-year sentence later this week, his lawyer said Wednesday.   Prosecutors were expected to take Abilio Soares to a special prison cell at Jakarta's Cipinang prison on Friday, said lawyer Otto Cornelis Kaligis.  Soares, an ethnic Timorese appointed by Jakarta, will be the first to go to prison out of six people who were ordered jailed by an Indonesian human rights court last year.  Three army officers, a former Dili police chief and a militia leader remain free pending appeals. The Supreme Court recently rejected Soares' appeal.  The rights court acquitted 11 security force members and one civilian over the Indonesian army-backed militia violence against independence supporters which cost at least 1,400 lives.  Soares has complained he is a scapegoat.  "Prosecutors told the human rights court on Monday about their plan to put him to jail. Abilio then said 'Why don't you shoot me to death instead?'" Kaligis said, quoting his client Soares.  Kaligis said Soares believed he had been made a scapegoat for the military and police since "not a single prosecuted police officer is serving a jail term" for the 1999 attacks.

Mr Karzai enjoys most support among the predominantly ethnic Pashtun population in eastern Afghanistan, where 92 per cent of people approved of his performance. But the president's approval rating dropped to 20 per cent in the north-west and 35 per cent among southern Pashtuns. The results of the survey of 804 people, sponsored by the Asia Foundation and conducted in the spring, came days after the Afghan electoral commission announced presidential elections on October 9. Eight out of 10 Afghans surveyed said they wanted to vote in elections, but 87 per cent said women would need their husband's permission and 18 per cent of men said they would not allow their wives to vote. Security was what most worried 40 per cent of the people polled, followed by the economy, which 29 per cent of interviewees said topped their list of concerns.

Correspondents say this is an important step forward in ending the long-running crisis which has left Cambodia without a proper government for nearly a year.  Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won last year's general election, but without enough seats to rule alone.   After long months of negotiations, the CPP finally struck a deal with the royalist Funcinpec party last month.   The widely-revered king is in self-imposed exile in North Korea, after being sidelined throughout the 11-month political deadlock.  He had earlier refused to sign the bill to allow Hun Sen's reappointment, and analysts say his change of heart could be a sign that he is willing to support the political process again.  "(I) appoint Hun Sen as the Prime Minister of the royal government of Cambodia," the king wrote in a document signed on Wednesday.   "The Prime Minister has the duty to propose forming of government and seek the approval from the National Assembly."   The appointment gives Hun Sen his third elected term. He has already been prime minister for almost 20 years, making him one of the world's longest serving leaders.  The move should also clear the way for a new government to be formed.    Stalled schedule   The lengthy political wrangling has already prevented Cambodia from taking some important actions, including preparation to join the World Trade Organization and concluding plans for a genocide trial to try former Khmer Rouge leaders.   But despite Wednesday's announcement, the political skirmishes seem far from over.  On Tuesday Cambodia's acting head of state, Chea Sim - who is also head of the CPP - left the country for what was officially termed "health reasons".  But he is thought to have refused to sign the bill to endorse Hun Sen as prime minister, and opposition groups say that troops and police had surrounded Chea Sim's house to force him to leave.

During a lively question-and-answer session, Tung made it clear that despite the July 1 protests he still believes China knows best when it comes to democracy.  ``I identify with the central government that its arrangement [on universal suffrage] is for the good of the long-term interests of Hong Kong,'' he said in response to sharp questioning from The Frontier's Emily Lau. She was demanding to know why Tung would not serve as an advocate for Hong Kong people who want to see full democracy here in time for the 2007-08 electoral cycle. Hong Kong, Tung said, has to see things from Beijing's standpoint. ``How will Hong Kong's development affect the interests of our country and the safety and well-being of our mainland compatriots?   ``We have to take into account our country's point of view. This is the basic principle,'' he said. While the policy gulf between Tung and the political opposition remains as great as ever, yesterday's session lacked the vitriol of past exchanges. Tung, in a deep blue suit and a crimson tie, appeared relaxed and even cracked the odd joke with lawmakers. Addressing this group of legislators for the last time, he expressed thanks for their work.   ``Everyone says that I am nostalgic. I am indeed nostalgic. I sincerely hope that I will be able to see most of you here again in October.'' Elections in September will return a new council, with 30 of the 60 seats filled by direct election and the remainder from more conservative functional constituencies.  Pro-democrat parties are hoping to gain a majority in the next Legco and to use the body to push a reform agenda on Beijing. In April, the National People's Congress Standing Committee ruled that universal suffrage could not be granted in Hong Kong by 2007-08 and gave no timetable for further changes in the political structure.  In yesterday's session, democrats called on Tung to fight for democracy, but he said that under the Basic Law, he was accountable to the central government.  ``After the NPC Standing Committee makes a decision, the chief executive has a statutory duty to implement the decision and be accountable to the central government,'' he said. Tung said he had no power to demand that Beijing overturn its decision.  ``If you continue to take this attitude, aren't you worried that you are planting a time bomb for your administration?'' democrat Andrew Cheng asked. ``Mr Tung, how many people do you want to see marching in the streets before you line up with them and urge the central government to give us democracy?''  Tung said he had relayed Hong Kong people's aspirations to the central government, but that was all he could do. Liberal Party leader James Tien lowered the heat of the debate when he asked Tung to help democrats obtain home-return permits to visit the mainland. Tien joked that he would especially like his opponents in the hotly contested New Territories East constituency - Andrew Cheng and Emily Lau - get permits that would allow them to stay away the entire campaign period. ``Allow them to visit the mainland until September 13 [the day after the Legco elections], that will be very good,'' he joked.  ``You all have to be careful. The Liberal Party and the chief executive are conspiring together,'' Tung answered, causing loud laughter in the chamber.

US state department spokesman Richard Boucher said Uzbekistan had made some encouraging progress over the past year on human rights, but Washington was disappointed by a lack of progress towards democracy.  Mr Boucher added that the US still wanted to co-operate with the country.  Uzbekistan has received tens of millions of dollars in US aid since 2001, when, after the September 11 attacks, it allowed American forces to use an airbase near the Afghan border.  Last month US officials said Uzbekistan's overall human rights record remained very poor, referring to what it described as serious abuses and deaths under detention.

Consumer sentiment rising to a 10-year high and a report yesterday showing business confidence rebounded in June, have increased the likelihood the Reserve Bank of Australia will lift rates for the first time this year, boosting the appeal of local assets.   ``The jump in consumer confidence has increased the possibility of a rate hike this year,'' said Lawrie Dryden, head of currency and asset allocation in Sydney at State Street Global Advisors, which manages $33 billion. ``It's added to reasons'' to buy ``the Australian dollar.''   Australia's dollar bought 72.53 U.S. cents at 5:00 p.m. in Sydney, from 72.45 cents late in Asia yesterday, when the currency rose as high as 72.85, the strongest since May 7.  The Reserve Bank of Australia has kept its target cash rate at 5.25 percent this year amid signs spending and borrowing had slowed, following two rate increases late in 2003.   Futures traders increased bets the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates later this year. The implied yield on the December 90-day bank bill futures rose to 5.59 percent from 5.56 percent yesterday. The December contract traded at an average yield of 55 basis points above the central bank's overnight cash rate in the past year.   The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists is for a quarter-percentage point rate rise by March next year. Nine economists forecast an increase this year.    Consumers   The consumer confidence index rose 4.5 percent from June to 119.5, the highest since July 1994, according to a Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute survey released in Sydney. A reading above 100 shows optimists outnumber pessimists. From a year earlier, sentiment gained 2.9 percent.   ``This can be good for the Australian dollar,'' as it ``means more spending and a healthier economy,'' said Stephen Koukoulas, chief strategist at TD Securities Ltd. in Sydney.   A report yesterday showed business confidence rebounded last month from a one-year low, spurred by extra consumer spending after the government paid out a total of A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) to some families in June as a tax benefit.   Australian government bonds were lower across all maturities. The 6.25 percent bond maturing in April 2015 fell 0.189, or A$1.89 per A$1,000 face amount, to 103.963, pushing the yield 2 basis points higher to 5.75 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.   ``With consumer sentiment at a record high the bond market is concerned this tips the balance toward a rate hike at some stage,'' said Warren Hogan, chief economist and head of bond strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in Sydney.    Retail Sales   Australia's dollar, also known as the Aussie, will extend gains should U.S. retail sales meet expectations later today, said Robert Rennie, currency strategist in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp. The currency will rise to 73 to 73.5 cents this week, he said.   Any signs of a slowing economy may encourage the Federal Reserve to raise its interest-rate target for overnight loans between banks at a ``measured'' pace. The gap between Australian and U.S. interest rates narrowed to 4 percent last month.  U.S. retail sales dropped 0.8 percent in June following a rise of 1.2 percent in May, according to the median estimate of 68 economist surveyed by Bloomberg News. Excluding vehicles, sales probably rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.7 percent the previous month.   ``Our economist sees the ex-auto component of retail sales falling 0.2 percent,'' said Rennie.   ``We therefore expect more U.S. dollar weakness and arguably this will be supportive for the Aussie as well.''

The agency, the Korea Development Institute, lowered its 2004 growth forecast to 5.2 percent from an April estimate of 5.5 percent, it said in a quarterly report released in Seoul. Morgan Stanley cut its projection to 4.6 percent from 4.9 percent. The central bank and investment banks including Citigroup, ING Groep and UBS have also trimmed growth forecasts in recent weeks. Growth more than halved to 3.1 percent last year as South Koreans were forced to cut spending after a credit binge left many unable to meet their debt payments. One in 13 of the nation's 48 million people were three months or more behind on interest payments at the end of May.  "Korea's domestic demand is weaker than we previously thought and is likely to stage a weaker recovery in 2005," Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a report. "The high level of household debt continues to weigh down consumption, while strong exports have not translated into domestic demand."  The government predicts that the economy will expand about 5 percent in 2004, less than the 6 percent target it set itself at the start of the year, and the Bank of Korea is forecasting 5.2 percent growth. The bank last week cut its second-half estimate to 5 percent from 5.6 percent.  The state agency said it expected consumer spending, which makes up more than half of South Korea's economy, to rise 0.7 percent this year, less than its April prediction for a 3.3 percent increase. Corporate investment in plant and machinery is expected to climb 6.1 percent, compared with 8.5 percent previously, it said.  The Korea Development Institute lowered its second-quarter economic growth estimate to 5.7 percent from 6.1 percent, its quarterly report showed.

Victims were drowned or trapped under landslides, which covered their homes in Niigata prefecture, according to local officials.  More than 400mm (16 inches) of rain have fallen in the region since Monday night, and more is feared.   Local authorities have requested military help in the rescue operation.  Residents have been seen shovelling mud out of their homes, and many roads remain blocked. Some were said to be choked by falling telephone poles and trees.  Japan's Meteorological Agency said more heavy rain was likely. Parts of Niigata are forecast to receive another 160mm of rainfall by Thursday morning.  The rain has already broken records for the Niigata region.  Many elderly people have been affected by the floods, with some forced to await rescue on upper storeys of buildings or rooftops.   The five who died were said to be aged between 72 and 83:   - 	In Sanjo, one man died when his house flooded   - 	Two women were found dead in the same town, one in a flooded field and the other near local government offices   - 	A farmer died after a mudslide destroyed his house in Tochio   - 	A woman was found dead in Izumozaki after her house was destroyed by a landslide.  On Tuesday, military helicopters reportedly rescued 66 children from their nursery school in Nakanoshima.  "I was scared," a little girl told Reuters news agency. "When I looked out of the window, it looked like a river out there."  About 1,000 children were forced to spend the night inside their schools.

Microsoft said it would contest the decision.   Toshihiro Hara, an official with the Fair Trade Commission, said the warning was the first in the world against the clause, which he said in effect prevented Japanese computer makers from demanding damages or royalty fees even when rivals violated patents for important technology.   Such concerns have increased over the past several years as Japanese manufacturers add consumer-electronics features to Windows-installed computers, Hara said.   "There are concerns the clause may discourage motivation to develop audiovisual technology and may hinder fair competition in that technological field in our nation," he added.  . Although the commission is not certain patents have been violated, it said several major Japanese makers suspected such violations and have objected to the provision since December 2000. Hara refused to give the makers' names.   Microsoft said it had omitted the conditions from new contracts. The Redmond, Washington based company also maintained that the disputed provisions were legal under Japanese, U.S. and European Union law.   "We have also been offering a different type of contract that does not include the provision and we are not forcing the provision to PC makers," said Takashi Hirano, an executive officer at Microsoft's Japan unit. "It is regrettable that the FTC did not recognize these points."   Microsoft is willing to go to court if it does not get a satisfactory result at the FTC hearing, Hirano said.   Analysts said Japanese authorities were trying to curb possibly monopolistic behavior in an effort to give more opportunities to alternatives such as the open-source Linux software system.   The European Commission found in March that Microsoft abused its "near monopoly" with Windows software.   In the United States, an appeals court last month approved a landmark antitrust settlement that Microsoft negotiated with the Justice Department.   Source;  AP, Reuters.

The world's second most populous country has one of the highest infection rates - and more than five million HIV/Aids cases.  To counteract the spread of the virus, the government recently launched its biggest anti-Aids initiative to date. But efforts are hampered by the fact that most Indians still find sex and Aids taboo subjects.    Stigma   In a corner of the St Katherine's Home in Bombay (Mumbai) a group of children are enjoying their playtime. But despite their singing and laughter these are not typical five-year-olds - all of them are HIV positive.  They were infected by their parents before they were born and were brought here sick and, in some cases, close to death. In a society where families are the main source of support, they are looked after by nurses and nuns.  Sister Shanti has 30 children in her care at this orphanage.  She says the hardest part for her is when people turn their back on children as young as these.  "It disturbs me when people discriminate against them.  "They have this disease through no fault of their own. They too have a right to live," she says.    Ignorance   For years many in India ignored the growing threat of Aids. Many simply could not imagine it was something that could affect them.  Down a crowded street in the heart of Bombay is the Unison clinic, one of the few in the city that deals with HIV patients.  Ram Kewar is on one of his regular visits - he is among 20 HIV-infected people who come here every day.  He was infected by the virus a few years ago and since then has passed it on to members of his family.  He says he had never even heard of the disease, far less about how it can be transmitted.  "I thought it was just my fate to have got it. It was only much later that I found out why it had happened to me."  The new Indian government has identified Aids as one of its priorities.  But the biggest problem is combating ignorance - and that includes people who are very influential.  Sanjay Nirupam is a politician belonging to the right-wing Shiv Sena party, an ally of the former Indian government and the main opposition party in Bombay.  He believes the issue is being overplayed.  "One always hears about Aids and how it's this big problem. But I have personally never come across anyone with Aids or seen anyone dying of the disease," he says.  "I think it's just hype."    Taboo topic   But it's a problem, which is not just confined to the poor or uneducated, or even the conservative.  It spreads across Indian society.  In a trendy Bombay cafe young men and women draw on cigarettes and sip long cocktails.  They are part of cosmopolitan Bombay's elite - upwardly mobile, liberal and well-informed.  This is one section of Indians who are more open to talking about Aids - but they would never think of doing so at home.  "It has to do with sex and that's something which is an absolute taboo," says twenty-something Rocky Bhatia.  "Most families simply will not bring it up."    Sign of hope   But there's hope at the other end of the social divide. Falkland Road right in the heart of the city is Bombay's red light district. For years activists have worked closely with the sex workers operating out of tiny rooms and filthy alleyways off this busy street. It's a move that is now paying dividends. Monica is a sex-worker who has seen many of her colleagues die.  In the past decade, Aids has claimed the lives of thousands of sex workers. Now they are learning to be more careful. Volunteers regularly visit every brothel handing out boxes of condoms and carrying out regular medical tests.  "If a customer refuses to use a condom we return his money and turn him away," says Monica.  "It doesn't matter how much money he offers us. Our lives are more important."  It is a small sign of success for a problem that needs to be tackled on a much larger scale.  Otherwise, it is estimated that in the next 10 years India could have more Aids cases than all of Africa.

Not very, as another PM is sworn in, for the interim.  It can now be said unequivocally: Pakistan has a revolving-door democracy; PMs come and go, the President calls the shots. Just glance at last week's events in Islamabad. Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali resigned (read: was sacked), Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain was appointed his successor. This is for an interim period during which the military establishment will find a safe seat from where to get 'miracle man' and finance minister Shaukat Aziz elected to the National Assembly. Then Hussain will resign to let Aziz replace him. But rumour is that even this revolving door will be closed permanently, and a presidential form of government ushered in.   Musharraf's choice of Aziz symbolises his deep distrust of the political class. As a technocrat who served the Saudi royal family and princes of the uae, and also worked with the World Bank in Washington, Aziz is expected to be indifferent to the country's democratic aspirations. But already the members of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q have started to ask: can Aziz find a safe seat from where he can get elected to the National Assembly?  The speculation has been sparked because PML-Q president Hussain did not mention Aziz in his speech of thanks after he was elected leader of the National Assembly (that is, in effect, the PM). He subsequently made amends at a party meeting after the presidency called reminding him of the script he, Jamali and Musharraf had agreed upon. Hussain has also been requesting the media not to refer to him as 'interim PM'. Reason: the Constitution does not recognise such a post.  The whisper campaign against Aziz has a sharp edge: his detractors say he belongs to the Ahmadi sect, declared non-Muslim here, and consequently can't be PM. Urdu dailies even headlined this rumour, goading Aziz into publicly denying it. His proximity to Washington has riled the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), an alliance of right-wing Islamist parties. With Musharraf already toeing Washington's line, Pakistan, MMA leaders say, will now have a PM whose thinking is anything but 'home-grown'.  MMA leader Qazi Hussain fired the first salvo saying, "The nomination of Aziz is a contempt of not only Parliament but the whole nation." MMA leaders say they are wary of Aziz because he will do Washington's bidding and roll back Pakistan's nuclear programme. Worse, Aziz's antecedents have prompted the Lahore High Court Bar Association to resolve that it will oppose him as PM due to his propensity to promote the US economic agenda.  Musharraf can sell Aziz to Washington and London as the man of 'western values' who is largely credited with having pulled Pakistan out of an economic quagmire. In reality, though, he is a 'non-political face' of Jamali, appointed to defend the President in the National Assembly. Indeed, Jamali was ousted because he would rarely intervene in the National Assembly debates, which routinely ripped apart every policy of the army headquarters.  As rumours about Jamali's imminent ouster gathered force in the last three weeks, Musharraf retaliated against the PM's 'betrayal' through complete silence. Jamali was reduced to pathetically appealing to the media to desist from such speculation. The loss of face was decidedly his, but it also devalued Pakistani democracy.  Democracy here will continue to be undermined as long as no systemic measures are taken to balance the trinity of forces in Pakistan. As Senator Aitizaz Ahsan explains, "Our constitutional history is the story of conflict between three elements - the civil and military bureaucracy, the judiciary and the fundamentalists. Only those politicians prepared to display abject subservience to this trinity can survive. Those who choose to challenge or even to question the trinity, there's death, imprisonment or exile.Unless the political and civil society address this distortion in our political-constitutional structure, there is little hope."  Most have already given up hope. They fear once Aziz is anointed as PM, he'll call for a snap poll. Musharraf will help him engineer a two-third majority. The Constitution will be amended to usher in the presidential form of government. That's been the denouement to all democracy dramas army generals have scripted in Pakistan.

Yasuko Imatomi feels like she has heard this song before, and she's not singing along anymore. The 41-year-old Tokyo homemaker has been a longtime supporter of Japan's dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and until fairly recently she counted herself as a fan of its silver-maned, silver-tongued leader, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. But here in the city's Shibuya neighborhood, as Koizumi and other party members begin campaigning for the July 11 Upper House election, Imatomi is a lot more cynical than she was three years ago when Koizumi first took office. As "Jun-chan" and company promise, yet again, to enact broad structural reforms that will overhaul Japan's calcified political and social systems, Imatomi says Koizumi has been making the same pledges for years and has far too little to show for it. "I'm having doubts about just how far he is willing to push his promises," she says. "I'm planning on voting for a different party this time."   In the past few weeks, people like Imatomi have turned into a big, unforeseen headache for the Prime Minister. As little as a month ago, Koizumi was flying high and seemingly unassailable. In rapid succession this spring, he made a bold dash to North Korea to fetch family members of repatriated Japanese citizens abducted by the Hermit Kingdom in the 1970s; deftly sidestepped a pension scandal that had crippled the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the nation's primary opposition party, by taking down its two most senior members; and headed off to the G-8 summit on Sea Island in the U.S. state of Georgia, where he was lavishly fêted at a private breakfast with American President George W. Bush. His burst of statesmanlike coups led many pundits in the Japanese media to declare that this week's election was over before the campaigning had even begun. The polling, they opined, would be just another formality as Koizumi, alone atop the Japanese political landscape, would lead his LDP to a runaway victory and begin his final two years in office with a clear mandate to pursue his most important initiatives and secure his place in history.   But something happened on the way to the landslide. Once boasting an approval rating of 87%, Koizumi's power base has always been his overwhelming public mandate. But popular support has suddenly dissipated at a crucial juncture in his career. Due to two critical missteps, Koizumi's approval rating has fallen from 54% to 40% (one of his lowest scores ever) in the past five weeks. According to recent opinion polls, voters have taken a dim view of his surprising declaration at the G-8 summit that he had decided without consulting (or even informing) the Diet to keep Japanese troops in Iraq indefinitely. They are likewise annoyed by the way the LDP rammed through a pension-reform bill last month that raised citizens' premiums and lowered their payouts while doing little to solve the system's fundamental flaws. Many see the pension bill as an underhanded and secretive move reminiscent of Japan's behind-closed-doors political tradition, one not in keeping with Koizumi's new era of openness and transparency. And others have called the Iraq decision slavish toadying to American dictates that puts Japanese lives at unwarranted risk. "These things have made people lose confidence in Koizumi fast," says Takao Toshikawa, a veteran political commentator and the editor in chief of the newsletter Tokyo Insideline.   The election that was supposed to be a Koizumi walkover has thus become a hotly contested battle, one that has breathed signs of life into the DPJ, which most commentators had declared all but dead. Rather than a rubber stamp for a Koizumi mandate, July 11 has now become a key measure of public confidence (or lack thereof) in the Prime Minister's performance and an important indicator of how the final years of his term may play out. With 121 seats up for grabs, the LDP's declared goal is to capture at least 51. While outright control of the government is not at stake even if it falls well short of that objective (the LDP-led coalition still retains a handsome majority in the far larger and more powerful Lower House), a disappointing performance could embolden some of Koizumi's bitterest enemies from within the LDP to call for a change of leadership. There is a precedent for this, if not a tradition: after four out of five of the most recent Upper House elections, the Prime Minister has been forced out within 54 weeks. As campaigning heats up, most politicians and observers say the chances of a catastrophic LDP drubbing followed by Koizumi's ouster are remote. But there is no doubt now that the LDP's performance will set the tone for the duration of Koizumi's tenure.   Unfinished business: it's the cloud that continues to hang over Koizumi's government. While he is already one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers since 1945, there can be little doubt that a man who has repeatedly vowed to "change Japan" - even if it requires destroying his own party - aspires to be remembered as a pivotal figure in Japanese history. And while Koizumi has made significant strides in areas such as banking reform and foreign affairs, if his administration were to end tomorrow, he would be remembered mostly for his charisma - and for a litany of promises unfulfilled. Will Koizumi go down in history as a leader who, like Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher, invigorated and modernized the government and, for better or worse, reoriented the attitudes and expectations of its citizens about the role the state plays in their lives? Koizumi has a daunting task ahead of him in the next two years if he is to secure that kind of stature. Most experts point to three primary areas - Japan's political structure, long overdue economic structural reforms, and the country's dysfunctional relationship with China - where he must devote his efforts if he is to be noted not just as one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers but as one of the best.    Executive Power  From the very beginning of his term in office, Koizumi has been Japan's most independent and "presidential" Prime Minister. Conducting himself as if he were an opposition leader, he routinely rails against his own party, which has held a virtually unbroken monopoly on power for almost 50 years. Thanks to his overwhelming popularity, Koizumi has been able to work outside the LDP's famous, and famously arthritic, faction system, neutralizing it in significant ways. Early on, for example, he broke with tradition and rankled the Old Guard by picking Cabinet members he thought were most qualified for their jobs, rather than filling the posts by quota with members from each faction. Over the past three years, he has similarly built an administration that introduces far more legislation into the Diet than most Prime Ministers before him have. He routinely and unapologetically makes unilateral decisions, whether it's to open a dialogue with North Korea without consulting Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs or deciding to keep troops in Iraq without checking with anyone at all. In a country where a secretive ruling élite brokered deals behind closed doors, Koizumi has made the government more open and the executive branch more accountable. The citizenry may be upset that Japanese troops are still in Iraq, but no one doubts where the buck stops.  Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the government will revert to politics as usual as soon as Koizumi leaves office. Sheila Smith, a Japan specialist at Hawaii's East-West Center, gives Koizumi credit for introducing "a whole new vocabulary for the LDP, one that includes responsiveness and transparency. The next person will not be able to retreat from that." At the same time, Smith readily admits that the next PM might not be up to the job. "There aren't many Koizumis out there," she says.   Curiously, this is a situation that Koizumi seems uninterested in remedying. Not only is there no leader with Koizumi's panache waiting in the wings, but virtually every political expert in Japan agrees that Koizumi has made no attempt to groom a generation of young politicians capable of carrying on his good works. "Koizumi may have cut through LDP factional politics," says former LDP lawmaker Raizo Matsuno, "but he's not interested in creating a successor." Take 49-year-old LDP secretary-general Shinzo Abe, Koizumi's heir apparent. Abe is a young, good-looking, impeccably credentialed reformer handpicked by Koizumi to be the party's No. 2 man. He appears on many of the LDP's election posters and has been delegated to take the lead on certain issues, such as the North Korea abductees. But those who know both men say he is far from Koizumi's tight-knit inner circle and could hardly be called a protégé. Many commentators, such as newsletter editor Toshikawa, say that Koizumi brought Abe into the fold not so much to nurture him as to keep him on a short leash. While Abe will doubtless be a powerful force in Japanese politics in the future, it is unclear whether his style will approach anything that could be called Koizumiesque. And though Koizumi has put the LDP faction machine in idle, its engine continues to hum.    Economy  One of the apparently unqualified successes of Koizumi's time in office has been Japan's surprisingly robust economic rebound. After fading in and out of recession for more than a decade, the country has posted two consecutive quarters of annualized GDP growth in excess of 6% (making it the world's fastest-growing mature economy), and results for the quarter ended June 30 are expected to be equally impressive. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock-market index, meanwhile, has surged 56% since its 20-year lows reached last April, corporate profits and confidence are stronger than they have been in a decade, and household spending, consumer confidence and employee bonuses are all on the rise.   Koizumi has garnered the most praise for filling high economic and policymaking posts with effective leaders. Financial Services Minister Heizo Takenaka, for example, has forced ailing Japanese banks—once seen as the single greatest threat to the nation's financial stability—to radically overhaul their balance sheets. Thanks to Takenaka's get-tough measures, nonperforming loans at major Japanese banks have fallen from 8% in 2001 to 5.2% at the end of March 2004; debt-rating agency Standard & Poor's has just lifted its assessment of several Japanese banks for the first time in 21 years. Meanwhile, Toshihiko Fukui, who was appointed Bank of Japan governor in March 2003, has been much more successful than his predecessor in stifling Japan's pernicious, decade-long bout of deflation through unconventionally loose monetary policies.   Even with such savvy appointments, many critics maintain that Koizumi has still mostly been lucky - that the economy has been buoyed primarily by forces beyond his control. While Koizumi has not attempted to kick-start growth via wasteful public-spending projects the way many of his predecessors did, much of Japan's economic revival is the result of self-initiated restructuring by many of the country's world-class multinational businesses. (Meanwhile, Japan's highly inefficient domestic industries, such as mom-and-pop retailing and food production, bumble along as unprofitably as ever.) And the voracious appetite of Chinese industries for basic materials, not to mention that country's growing consumer demand, has proved to be a surprising and welcome salvation to a broad swath of Japanese manufacturers and exporters that only recently had been sounding the alarms about China's ability to "export deflation" or "hollow out Japanese industry" by taking over factory jobs once handled by domestic workers.   Regardless of the immediate causes of Japan's recovery, questions remain about its sustainability. Koizumi came to power as an economic reformer. Yet his three pet reform initiatives - privatizing the postal system, reforming the quasi-governmental highway-development companies, and overhauling the pension system - have barely left the drawing board since he made some of them central campaign planks as far back as 2001. In interviews with the Japanese press last month, Koizumi said that privatizing the postal system - an oddball governmental institution that not only delivers mail but also acts as the country's largest savings bank and as an insurance company - was his highest priority. An increasingly skeptical populace has been hearing that same promise for more than three years, and few believe he has enough political capital left to force unwilling LDP members to make the radical legislative changes necessary. Editor Toshikawa says, "He simply doesn't have the clout to carry out these privatization schemes. And if the LDP doesn't get 51 seats [in the Upper House election], he might abandon postal reform altogether."   Even those who are sanguine about Japan's recent economic performance warn that as long as structural reforms and a pension overhaul remain uncompleted, the country's fundamentals will continue to decay. The soaring stock market, they say, has papered over lingering inefficiencies at many companies, giving a much-needed (though potentially short-lived) boost to their asset levels. Similarly, Japan faces the worst demographic time bomb in the industrialized world - a problem that Koizumi and the LDP's pension reforms have done little to address. Many say Koizumi has lost any taste he may have had for the battles necessary to effect change. "The whole pension system needs to be taken apart and rebuilt," says Kazuhiko Nishizawa, an analyst at the Japan Research Institute in Tokyo, "but the administration isn't thinking that far ahead."    China  While Koizumi came to power as a domestic reformer, his greatest successes have so far been in foreign affairs. He boldly dispatched troops to Iraq (the first shipment of Japanese troops to a foreign land without the United Nations' blessing since World War II), and has maneuvered to be a major participant in the multinational engagement with North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. For all his aplomb on the geopolitical scene, however, Koizumi has allowed Japan's crucial relationship with China to languish. "While pursuing closer ties with the U.S. and attempting to normalize relations with North Korea, Koizumi has abandoned China," says Jun Iio, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. Since taking office, Koizumi has lived up to his promise to visit Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's military war dead, at least once a year - meaning the Prime Minister, regularly like clockwork, offends China, whose citizens were brutalized by Japanese soldiers during World War II. Beijing has declared that Koizumi is unwelcome as long as the visits continue. So while trade between China and Japan has been booming, diplomatic relations are stalled.   Fixing that may mean making compromises about Yasukuni Shrine and more fully addressing other aspects of Japan's past war conduct, such as the Nanjing Massacre. Any admission of wrongdoing would be very unpopular with many of Koizumi's most conservative supporters, but political experts maintain that such compromises are the only way to get more fruitful dialogues with China rolling. "China is strengthening its presence throughout East Asia, but Japan and China have so many unresolved, complicated issues," says Terumasa Nakanishi, professor of international politics at Kyoto University.   From the day he burst onto the political scene, Koizumi was the outsider in his own party, relying on charm and public support to push his often-maverick agenda. But as his popularity rating now hovers near an all-time low, his antagonistic relationship with many of his colleagues may have boxed him in on everything from structural reforms to international relations. While Koizumi's tenure has already been an unqualified, if modest, success on a number of fronts, he has an exceedingly tough climb ahead of him if he is to achieve all of his goals before leaving office. According to Glen Fukushima, ex-president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, what was once a river of goodwill that allowed Koizumi to float, almost miraculously, above the politics-as-usual fray, has begun to evaporate. That has created a vicious circle that threatens to snuff out his attempts to salvage a lasting political legacy. "His failure to implement what he has said he would do," Fukushima says, "has led to a decline in his popularity - which makes it difficult for him to do what he needs to." Back in 2001, as Japan's Prime Minister came to power on a wave of confidence and public optimism, he declared himself "Junichiro Koizumi, the lionhearted." As he heads into a tight election and perhaps his toughest season of policy battles, Koizumi has an opportunity to prove whether he deserves that nickname not just because of his leonine mane, but because of the power of his convictions and the tenacity of his fight.

The units lost $12.5 million last year on sales of $577.5 million, according to court filings cited by Reuters.

Independent download service Wippit has signed with its third major music company in a deal with Sony Music UK, adding to the company's partnerships with BMG and EMI Music signed in March, and adding to its library of 200 independent labels. Also announced today, Napster has entered into a worldwide distribution deal with the UK's Association of Independent Music (AIM) to initially offer 50,000 tracks from 50 of AIM's 800 independent labels on the new Napster service when it launches this summer.  Napster, which signed with UK retailer Dixons last week to have its 2.0 software installed on all Dixons' own-brand computers, said that its US members will also gain access to this content. The licensing deal will also be made available to continental European labels under the IMPALA (Independent Music Companies Association) umbrella. The deal, negotiated by AIM's new media arm Musicindie and administered by Rightsrouter, includes repertoire from labels including Ninja Tune, Domino, Cooking Vinyl and Hospital, featuring artists such as Kruder & Dorfmeister and The Orb. Many other AIM members are expected to join over the coming months, Napster said. In Wippit's case, Sony Music content including tracks from Beyonce, Manic Street Preachers and Anastacia will become available when Wippit's service launches, also in the summer.  Sony's music library will be included in Wippit's 'a la carte' single download service, allowing users to burn a limited number of CD copies and export tracks to portable devices. Wippit last month celebrated a relaunch of its website by offering 'a la carte' music downloads for 29 pence. The company also launched the offering to purchasing music downloads using an SMS mobile phone billing option, targeting the youth market and similar to a feature launched by rival, OD2 in March.

Mitsubishi's net income for the year that ended March 31 rose 85 percent to ¥115 billion, or $1 billion, from a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said. Mitsui said profit more than doubled to ¥68.4 billion, from ¥31.1 billion.  China's economic growth has helped push the prices of crude oil and steel to their highest levels in more than a decade. Earnings growth may slow this year as China and the United States try to temper economic expansion to ease a shortage of raw materials.  The key for the trading companies lately has been that they are doing well in China and in the United States, said Shigemi Nonaka, chairman of Polestar Investment. "Another thing is their handling of energy-related businesses in the Middle East," he added.  Mitsubishi said earnings in the current fiscal year might rise 13 percent to ¥130 billion. Mitsui forecast an earnings gain this year of 17 percent to ¥80 billion.  Mitsubishi shares rose ¥47 to ¥996 while Mitsui stock rose ¥6 to ¥822.  Mitsubishi, which operates units worldwide including mining, convenience stores and aircraft leasing, said profit from its mining and metal operations rose 29 percent to ¥31 billion, while net income from energy trading jumped 28 percent to ¥30.6 billion. Machinery earnings almost doubled to ¥42.2 billion, from ¥21.2 billion.  Shares of Mitsubishi have fallen 9.2 percent since April 25, when Mitsubishi Motors' largest shareholder, Daimler Chrysler, withdrew financial support for the automaker.  Mitsui, which operates mines, trades oil and natural resources and sells other products, said profit at its metals division gained 58 percent in the year just finished to ¥23.6 billion. Income from machinery and telecommunication equipment was ¥7.3 billion, which compared with a ¥4.92 billion loss the previous year.  Itochu reports annual loss Itochu, Japan's third-biggest trading house, reported an annual net loss of ¥31.9 billion, or $281 million, after it wrote down the value of its assets.  The company predicted a return to profit this year. Itochu's loss for the 12 months that ended March 31 compared with a profit of ¥20.1 billion a year earlier, the Osaka-based company said.

The country raked in foreign direct investment worth more than 8% of GDP last year: even more, proportionally, than China. After its oversized and overheating neighbour, Vietnam also boasts Asia's best-performing economy. It has grown by an average of 7.4% a year over the past decade and is likely to achieve a similar figure this year. Better yet, the boom has lifted many Vietnamese out of poverty. As recently as 1993, the World Bank considered 58% of the population poor. By 2002, that had fallen to 29%. Can Vietnam maintain this remarkable momentum?  So far, its economy has proved unstoppable. Neither last year's outbreak of SARS, a respiratory disease which scared away tourists, nor this year's avian flu epidemic, which hurt poultry farmers, made much of a dent. Even during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, when other countries in the region were plunged into recession, growth in Vietnam never fell below 4.8%.  At first, agricultural reform, which redistributed land from the state to poor farmers, propelled the boom. More recently, export growth, fuelled by cheap, efficient labour and burgeoning foreign investment has driven the economy. Exports leapt 20% last year. As Do Duc Dinh, a local economist, points out, the money Vietnam earns from this trade - roughly $20 billion last year - now dwarfs the $2 billion-odd it gets each year in hand-outs from foreign donors. Vietnam's exports to America doubled in 2002, after the two countries signed a trade pact, and again in 2003.  Admittedly, as trade with America grows, it has become more controversial. Last year, American catfish farmers, by invoking arcane anti-dumping laws, persuaded their government to impose steep tariffs on imports of Vietnamese catfish. Now American shrimp-fishermen are trying to repeat the same trick. American bureaucrats are also contemplating reducing the amount of garments Vietnam can export to America, as a penalty for allowing Chinese-made clothes to enter America on Vietnam's quota. Even if Vietnam is let off the hook, the quota will from now on only grow by a few percentage points a year. Between 2001 and 2003, by contrast, textile exports to the United States grew from $47m to $2.4 billion.  But Vietnam's diversified exports - it produces commodities, agricultural goods and manufactures - provide insulation against fluctuations in any single product. Its markets are diverse, too: although catfish exports to America fell by a third after the new tariffs were imposed, overall exports of catfish grew, as Vietnamese exporters found new customers in Europe and Australia. Vietnam also hopes to join the World Trade Organisation next year. But even if this deadline slips, it still has its trade pact with America, its membership of AFTA, a South-East Asian free-trade area, and its proximity to China.  Small businesses have also boomed, since the government passed a new law in 2000 making it easier to set them up. By the end of 2002, over 50,000 new companies had sprung up. But as Martin Rama of the World Bank points out, Vietnam has almost no middling private firms between these mom-and-pop ventures and big exporters backed by foreign investors.  Such businesses find it hard to grow because they cannot readily get access to land or capital. About half of bank lending goes to state-owned enterprises, although that share is falling. What is more, even if banks (mostly state-owned themselves) wanted to lend to entrepreneurs, the latter have little collateral to pledge for their loans. In Vietnam, the state owns all the land and grants land-use rights to farmers, businesses and home-owners. Although these are theoretically transferable, banks are fearful that Vietnam's antiquated courts would not enforce their rights. Such fears have precluded a free market for land, further adding to private firms' difficulties. Corruption also weighs heaviest on small businesses: in some provinces, they can be subjected to as many as 15 different bureaucratic inspections each year.  The government, although trying to solve some of these problems, appears addicted to public enterprise. It continues to provide state-owned firms with loans and land - which many of them then rent on at a mark-up to the private sector. It invests with Stakhanovite zeal in impressive but uneconomical facilities, such as oil refineries, steel mills and fertiliser plants.  The net result is a massive misallocation of resources. Vietnam's ratio of investment to economic growth has fallen by roughly a quarter in recent years. To reverse that slide, argues Robert Glofcheski, an economist at the UN Development Programme, the government must revert to the same tactics that made its agricultural reforms so successful: more spending on health and education, further transfers of assets from the public to the private sector and faster deregulation.  Such moves are particularly important if poverty is to be reduced further. Thanks in part to the stunning success of the past decade; tackling poverty has become more difficult. The poor are now concentrated in remote, rural districts populated chiefly by ethnic minorities—just the sort of area least touched by the government's reform programme. Now that industry has replaced agriculture as the main engine of the economy, cities are growing faster than the countryside. Vietnam cannot afford to provide services to the rural poor, or cope with a population influx in the cities, and cosset state-owned firms at the same time—even during a boom.

Deutsche Post expands again in US   Alliances and acquisition activity in the European and global postal markets has continued this year with a series of recent announcements by European mail and express operators.  Deutsche Post has announced that it has made two new acquisitions in the US postal market. Its subsidiary Deutsche Post Global Mail USA has reached agreements to acquire U.S. mail service providers SmartMail Services, a leading provider of transport and sorting services for flat mail, and QuikPak Inc. a market leader in catalogue fulfilment. The new organisation will employ 1,850 people in the USA and will generate revenue of about $600m (€500m). It will utilise the network of USPS with which the companies already have existing agreements. Meanwhile in Europe TNT Express has announced that it has entered into an alliance with Norway Post, which will enable it to sell its global express products through Norway's post office network. This is in addition to a similar deal with Sweden's national postal operator, Posten. In the UK there has been better news for the beleaguered national postal operator, Royal Mail. The organisation is two years into its recovery plan and is expected to announce operating profits of £250m (€365m) for the year ending March 2004, a significant improvement on the £197m (€307m) loss suffered last year. This turnaround has prompted civil servants to once again consider the sale of the group, which could be valued at £4bn (€5.84bn), representing the largest privatisation in the UK since in 1996. The recent problems encountered by Royal Mail have, in part, been caused by the increased competition within the UK mail market, especially in the more profitable business sector.  In the past few months, DPWN, TPG, Hays and Business Post have all been awarded licences to provide competitive services in the lucrative business-to-business arena.

       HIGHLIGHTS     BANKING – SERVICES    UBS enters ultra-high-net worth market, crowding industry   We've brought you news before of top Wall Street firms stepping up their plans to court ultra-high-net worth accounts, usually defined as $10 million or more.   The latest entrant: UBS. The Zurich bank on Wednesday offered details of its new, U.S.-based Private Wealth Management Group, which will be run by Managing directors Anthony DeChellis and Michael Schweitzer. UBS also hired two former Merrill Lynch bankers: Kevin Ruth, who serves now as senior vice president; and Michael Ban, who will head the Advanced Wealth Strategies Group. The move reflects the heated competition for these customers, who are obviously among the most profitable for full-service firms. With so many firms bent on carving out market share, this is a pretty good time to be in the ultra-high-net worth category. The competition will be fierce, however, and promotions will abound. In the end it really boils down to relationships. I look for the top firms to step up their recruiting as much as their marketing.

Google is really launching an attack. First they've got the Google Mail thing, then the Google Groups 2, with the ability to create mailing lists, and now they're taking on Microsoft with a hard drive search. Strangely enough I think this third time may be the charm.   Why? Because one requests I get from readers all the time is pointers to a good hard drive search utility. AltaVista offered one, years ago, and people are STILL nostalgic about it. I'm not sure how many people need a gigabyte of mail space, and I’m not sure how many people need to start their own mailing list, but Google may be surprised at the amount of interest in a local search utility.

Comparable-store sales fell by 12.9% as Kmart focused on regaining profitability and liquidity by reducing expenses and inventories, said Julian C. Day, president and chief executive officer. The company attributed the comp decline to less advertising and to several promotions during the year-ago quarter. Total sales fell 25.3%, reflecting the closure of 316 stores during the first quarter last year.

The latest additions include the newly opened Brentwood Bay Lodge & Spa in Victoria, Canada, Hotel Teatro in downtown Denver and The Lodge at Molokai Ranch in Hawaii.    "These three new properties are great additions to our group.  They all offer the comfort, quality and most importantly the experience that has become synonymous with SLH," commented Ed Donaldson, VP of Marketing for The Americas.      After two years and more than $11 million, Brentwood Bay Lodge & Spa (www.slh.com/brentwood) has constructed a contemporary resort located on a pristine inlet on Vancouver Island providing spectacular ocean views from every vantage point and perfect for SLH.   With natural materials, huge timbers and expansive glass, the resort is a sanctuary where understated elegance and discerning service are essential. The Lodge's dedication to luxury and quality is evident in the $340,000 they spent on each of the 33 Ocean Suites featuring king beds, fireside sitting areas, balconies, handcrafted furnishings and spa-like bathrooms.  Comfort and relaxation continues with a visit to Brentwood Bay's spa which focuses on a unique west coast perspective with signature Essence of Life and Vinotherapy treatments.  Brentwood's 65-slip Marina & Eco-Adventure Centre is the gateway to wine tasting, kayaking, scuba diving and eco-cruising in this unspoiled environment.  Relaxing and fun possibilities abound at the newest member of Small Luxury Hotels.    Adding to SLH's presence in city centers is Hotel Teatro (www.slh.com/teatro), Denver's luxury boutique hotel.  Located in downtown Denver and aptly named for its proximity to the theater, Hotel Teatro offers exquisite accommodations for the business traveler or weekend getaway. Unique costumes and photographs from past theatrical productions of the Denver Centre Theatre Company decorate the hotel lobby and guest rooms. Hotel Teatro offers 111 guest rooms which are decorated in rich, soft gold or sage tones. Indonesian sandstone foyers set the stage of refined elegance, complemented by custom built cherry wood armoires and headboards, luxurious damask fabrics, contemporary art deco furniture covered with fine fabrics, and luxurious touches like down comforters. Luxurious baths have Indonesian marble and sandstone finishes and are appointed with chrome features. All rooms feature custom desks with leather blotters, a laser printer, scanner, copier, fax, dedicated data ports, and two-line telephones with caller-ID and voicemail, as well as complimentary high-speed Internet access. Cultural senses are further aroused by Award-winning chef/restaurateur Kevin Taylor who operates the hotel's two restaurants - Jou Jou, a casual American bistro and Restaurant Kevin Taylor which provides a highly lauded fine dining experience.  Hotel Teatro provides the perfect home-base to explore and experience the beauty and culture of Denver.    On the opposite end of the spectrum from a city center hotel is the magnificent Lodge at Molokai Ranch (www.slh.com/molokai) which is considered one of the remaining true Hawaiian experiences. General Manager Teri Waros commented, "This property offers a Hawaiian experience of what the islands were like before tourism brought the masses to paradise.  I am ecstatic about becoming a member of SLH for the opportunity to share our uniqueness with travelers from around the world."  The Lodge is set at the west end of Molokai, on the far edge of the 64,000-acre Molokai Ranch, with a view of Honolulu and Diamond Head in the far distance.  The Lodge's 22 guest rooms are individually decorated with whimsical styling including hand-crafted furniture that ranges from Art Deco to Mission oak.  Although a piece of natural paradise, guest rooms feature modern amenities such as TV's, phones, high speed Internet service and DVD players.  As a result of Molokai's membership with SLH and dedication to luxury, they have begun a continuous upgrading of room interiors making them even more luxurious and comfortable.  The property features a formal dining room where evening meals are dominated by an abundance of fresh seafood and wines from the Wine Spectator award winning wine list.  An infinity edge pool is secluded just off the lodge offering gorgeous views of the ocean. The spa at Molokai offers an array of services including massage, facials and body treatments.  To further enhance the relaxing nature of the lodge, a Tai Chi, Yoga and Hula pavilion is being constructed.  Guests can indulge in a true old Hawaiian atmosphere and experience the best in eco-adventure.    Small Luxury Hotels of the World provides guests with unparalleled luxury experiences and these three new members will even further elevate the capacity to deliver grand experiences.

Lafley has kicked up the good ideas at the stodgy Midwestern giant—and the company's growth too. Here's an inside look at how he's doing it.    When Procter & Gamble purchased Iams five years ago, many people worried that the rule-bound behemoth would muck up the growth of the savvy pet-food marketer. Iams was one of those companies (think Starbucks) that had an almost magical bond with its consumers, selling $13 bags of cat food and other high-priced products exclusively in pet stores and through veterinarians. P&G, being P&G, flexed its marketplace muscle immediately: Using 3,000 trucks to move Iams into 25,000 mass retail outlets, it increased distribution nearly 50% overnight. Then, armed with research indicating that pet owners fear that their four-footed family members will die before they do, Iams's R&D folks began collaborating with Procter's scientists who study human hearts, bones, muscles, teeth, and gums. Iams unleashed a stream of new foods aimed at lengthening pets' lives —weight-control formulas, antioxidant blends, tartar-fighting "dental defense" ingredients.   It paid off: Iams has moved from the nation's No. 5 pet-food brand to No. 1. Worldwide sales have doubled to $1.6 billion; profits have tripled. Now, to woo vets, P&G is expanding Iams into the business of magnetic-resonance imaging—yes, Iams-branded MRIs for dogs and cats—and Iams-branded insurance to help pay for the $1,200 scans. "We're offering consumers peace of mind," says P&G CEO A.G. Lafley, who owns a Cavalier King Charles spaniel and two Maine coon cats.   Iams is just one example of how P&G is reemerging as master brand-builder and model growth company. P&G a growth company? Yes—thanks largely to the innovations that Lafley has sparked at the company. When he took over in the summer of 2000, things were grim. His predecessor, Dirk Jager, a brusque, hard-charging Dutchman who ran P&G for 17 months, grew one thing: costs. Volumes flattened and profit margins shrank on P&G's biggest brands, which include Pampers, Tide, and Crest. The stock fell 43%.

Online retail sales totaled $114 billion in 2003, a 51 percent jump from the year before, with online travel, home furnishings and computer hardware and software spurring the biggest gains.  Although online retailers halved their marketing expenses, they still struggle with holding down the costs of helping customers and fulfilling orders, according to the study of 150 retailers that sell goods online by Forrester Research for Shop.org, a division of the National Retail Federation, based in Washington, D.C.  The increased costs reflect a broader population of online shoppers, the report concluded.  "As more mainstream shoppers begin to shop online, they need more help with the ordering process and are more likely to pick up the phone when they need service, raising costs for retailers," the report stated.  Customer service costs increased to $2.30 per order in 2003 from $1.90 in 2002, with store-based retailers ringing up the highest costs of $2.70 per order.  Retailers' online fulfillment costs jumped to $9.80 per order from $6.30 in 2002. That cost, too, could result from shoppers new to the Web, who require extra incentives before they hit the "buy" button, the study concluded. Retailers often lure newbies to buy by offering free shipping.  Another trend that might raise retailers' fulfillment costs is the growth in online sales of jewellery, clothing and furniture - items more expensive to ship than books and electronics, according to the study.  Retailers also had a harder time convincing their broader audience to close sales online, the study found.  As more consumers get broadband access, they're able to comparison-shop more easily across more Web sites. So retailers focused more on helping shoppers research products than on pushing them to close a sale, the report concluded.  Also, brick-and-mortar retailers are using their Web sites to drive traffic into their stores, which mean the Web sites don't record those sales, said Scott Silverman, executive director of Shop.org.  Nevertheless, more retailers are making a profit - 79 percent of all online retailers in 2003 vs. 70 percent in 2002.  "Retailers online have found the right balance between selling a product, acquiring and retaining customers and earning a profit, which is powerful news for consumers and retail investors," said Elaine Rubin, chairman of Shop.org.  Online retailing accounted for 5.4 percent of all retail sales in 2003.

The Munich based Ifo institute said its closely watched business climate index fell to 96.1 in May from 96.3 in April. The fall, slightly less than expected, took the index back to its November level. Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said the data, based on a survey of 7,000 companies, pointed to "a continuation of the ongoing, moderate recovery in Germany over coming months." He attributed the slight fall in the index to "gloom in the eastern states, whereas in western Germany it rose slightly." The institute said companies' assessment of current conditions worsened slightly while future expectations was little changed. Howard Archer of Global Insight said the survey results showed firms remained cautious in their investment and employment plans. "Continuing softness in the labour market is likely to weigh on the consumer " making it difficult for the German economy to grow "by much more than 1.5 per cent," he added. The broad based weakness of German domestic demand was highlighted by final first quarter gross domestic product figures which confirmed earlier estimates of 0.4 per cent growth. The data showed that Germany's economic revival continued to be export led, with exports rising 4.6 per cent in the quarter. Imports rose 2.9 per cent. The federal statistics office said net exports contributed 0.8 percentage points to GDP growth while domestic consumption declined 0.4 per cent from the final quarter of last year. Government consumption fell 1.2 per cent while private consumption was unchanged on the quarter. Spending on machinery and investment fell 0.4 per cent. Construction spending was down 3.1 per cent. Economists said there was little sign that booming external demand was sparking an upturn in private consumption and investment, both seen as vital if Germany's modest economic recovery is to prove sustainable. Gernot Nerb, Ifo economist, said the trend in German employment was still downwards although it should stabilise by the end of the year. He said there was also sign of modest improvement in the retail sector. Given the current state of the German economy, Mr Nerb, who has in the past advocated an interest rate cut to stimulate activity, said he now saw little need for the European Central Bank to ease its stance. The ECB meets next week to consider its stance on interest rates. Many analysts fear growth in Germany and the rest of the euro-zone could start to slow in the second half of the year as the pace of global expansion eases in the face of surging oil prices.

Shares in Casino, France's second-largest listed retailer, soared 3.4 percent, besting a slightly weaker DJ Stoxx index of European retailers. Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer, went up 1.3 percent, and Dutch Ahold increased 1.4 percent.  Those rises followed a Financial Times report that Wal-Mart c.e.o. H. Lee Scott was interested in opening Wal-Marts across Europe, and that the retailer's international growth would come from a combination of strategic acquisitions and greenfield expansion.   According to analysts, Wal-Mart's interest in European growth is nothing new. "It's an issue that has come up frequently ever since Wal-Mart acquired [British retailer] Asda, and they have not made any secret about their ambition to be a pan-European player," one London-based retail analyst said. "The added wrinkle this time seems to be that Wal-Mart is approaching Brussels."   Right now Scott is in the Belgian capital, where he is scheduled to meet European officials, including competition commissioner Mario Monti, according to the Financial Times. Analysts believe Lee will confer with EU authorities, as Wal-Mart did in the United Kingdom before purchasing Asda, about possible EU obstacles to takeovers and greenfield expansion.   As well as Asda in the United Kingdom, Wal-Mart has two money-losing acquisitions in the difficult German retail market. That leaves France and Italy as the big European markets most likely to appeal to Wal-Mart, but with few retailers of any size to purchase in Italy, analysts think France will be the company's first choice.   Carrefour merged with Promodes in 1999 in part to counter Wal-Mart's anticipated European invasion, but the current weak share prices of both French retailers - which this year have trailed behind European rivals by 18 percent and 15 percent, respectively - make both more vulnerable currently.   According to one investment banker, "There is no doubt [Wal-Mart wants] Carrefour. It makes the most sense for them. They can't do anything big in the U.K., and Carrefour gives you not only France, but southern Europe and emerging markets. Both in size and format, Carrefour works better for them than Casino."  But purchasing Carrefour, with its sales base in France and Spain, would make Wal-Mart by far the largest retailer in Europe - a potential concern for the EU on competition grounds. A bid would also have to be hostile, making a management exit more likely and cultural issues more delicate.   Analysts say France's second-largest retailer, Auchan, might also beof interest to Wal-Mart, but Auchan's capital is privately held by an independent-minded family, so a takeover would be harder.

       HIGHLIGHTS    RETAIL – BUSINESS DIVERSITY   Video Rental: Blockbuster Rolls Subscriptions, McDonald's Tests Vending    Two big companies have made significant news in video rentals this week. Blockbuster here said it has rolled out its in-store Movie Pass, which is similar to the subscription model used, online by Netflix and Wal-Mart.   For fees ranging from $24.99 to $29.99, customers can rent an unlimited number of DVD or VHS video titles, up to two or three at a time, and keep them indefinitely with no due dates or late fees. Meanwhile, McDonald's, Oak Brook, Ill., is reportedly testing Redbox vending machines in its 105 Denver restaurants, offering video rentals for $1 a day, with payment by credit card. About two dozen machines have been installed so far, according to media reports. In a previous test in the Washington and Baltimore markets, McDonald's had tried vending units offering a wide array of convenience items, but the video rental component was the most successful, the media reports said.

Wal-Mart currently operates Asda in the United Kingdom and has stores in Germany; otherwise, it does not have a presence in Europe. “We’re definitely interested in growth, and a lot of that will come outside the U.S.,” said Bill Wertz, a Wal-Mart spokesman. He told SN he could not confirm Scott’s specific remarks. According to a report in the Financial Times online edition, Scott said the company would expand in Europe through a combination of acquisitions and new-store development.

Online retailer Amazon.com yesterday had its own unscripted moment.   Dan Barr, a productivity consultant from Seattle, led shareholders in three "hip-hip-hoorays" during the online retailer's question-and-answer session at Bell Harbor Conference Center. The audience seemed reluctant to participate at first, but warmed up by the third cheer.  "I suppose it was because, often, there was kind of a deafening silence," said Barr, 62, of starting a tradition two years ago to lead cheers at local corporate annual meetings. He headed one at Nordstrom's annual meeting yesterday, too.  "These are fabulous companies," said Barr, who attended 17 annual meetings last year. "I think (shareholders) ought to be celebrating and encouraging them to be the very best."  Amazon's annual shareholders meeting serves as the one time each year that noninstitutional investors can meet and question Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. One shareholder suggested strengthening Amazon's executive compensation policy. The proposal received 3 percent of the shareholder vote.  As has become customary, Bezos used part of the time to show off a variety of the online retailer's better-selling, if not more unusual, products. He selected from a wall of items arranged next to letters from A to Z.  Next to H was the Stiletto-brand hammer, a 15-ounce piece of titanium that sells for $174.99 in the retailer's home and garden store.  "This is the hammer of choice - solid cast titanium," Bezos said, holding it up for investors to see. "That's important in case your hammer ever needs to go Mach 3."  S stood for Sweet Mele's Hawaiian Coconut Surfboard Syrup, which sells in the gourmet food store for $3.69.  "Our anti-Atkins strategy is that, as groceries shed products like this and replace them with healthy, high-protein products, we'll be the last man standing," Bezos quipped.  Amazon last year reported a $35.3 million profit on $5.3 billion in sales, as its customers responded to deep discounts and a standing free-shipping offer on orders of more than $25.  After the meeting, Bezos declined to answer questions from reporters about a lawsuit brought last week by partner Toysrus.com.  "It's active litigation," he said. "It's not appropriate to comment on it."  In August 2000, the companies signed a 10-year deal to operate co-branded toy and baby stores online. But Toysrus.com sued Amazon on Friday, alleging it violated that arrangement by allowing other retailers to sell toys and baby products on Amazon's site.  Toysrus.com, a division of Toys R Us, has paid more than $200 million since the deal began for the right to exclusivity, according to the lawsuit.  The deal became the cornerstone of Amazon's strategy to expand its selection through partnerships with other retailers. Its largest partners include retailers such as Target, Borders.com and Office Depot.  Prominent mediator Randall Wulff, principal of Wulff, Quinby & Sochynsky in Oakland, Calif., oversaw talks on Thursday and Friday. Toysrus.com filed the lawsuit on the second day.  Wulff said yesterday that a lawsuit doesn't mean the end to mediation, and he has encouraged both sides to consider returning to the table. "It's not unusual to retire, let the dust settle, reflect maturely and then return," he said.  Amazon's shares closed yesterday at $43.62, up $1.99.

Online revenues in every product category gained (with the exception of autos and auto parts, due to a survey methodology change.) The growth rate in categories that have greater maturity online, such as computers and books, took a back seat to that of newer categories. For example, online sales of sporting goods grew 104% in 2003 over 2002; while the flowers, cards and gifts category grew 98% and health and beauty grew 93%.  Overall, online sales accounted for 5.4% of total retail sales in 2003, up from 3.6% in 2002. In 2004, online sales are projected to account for 6.6% of total retail sales. One of the most significant changes from 2002 is that in the aggregate, all retailer types recorded operating profitably in 2003. A total of 79% of retailers posted positive operating margins for their online businesses last year, with retailers in the aggregate reporting operating margins of 21%.  Web-based retailers showed the greatest improvement in operating margins over last year, turning a loss of 16% in 2002 to a gain of 15% in 2003.  According to recent market report online retailing has experienced its own version of survival of the fittest, pointing out that those that failed to control costs and attract consumers shut down. Store-based retailers improved profitability, reporting average operating margins of 7% in 2002 to 21% in 2003. With average operating margins of 28%, catalog-based retailers were retail’s most profitable group in 2003.  A recent survey found that while retailers’ investment in technology such as cross-channel tracking systems was flat between 2002 and 2003, the multi-channel experience of the customer didn’t suffer as a consequence. The web influenced one in four offline purchases, the retailers reported. 87% of retailers now accept in-store returns of online purchase, up from 78% last year. However, as cross-channel integration improved as retailers encouraged shoppers to buy in stores and online traffic increased, conversion rates fell – to 2.4% in 2003 to from 3.2% in 2002.  According to the report’s authors, online sales and profitability gains in 2003 indicate most retailers have mastered the basics of online selling. The key to the next phase for retailers is differentiating themselves on the basis of marketing, merchandising, and the quality of the multi-channel experience.  As investment in digital marketing reaches an all-time high, retailers must experiment with local search, word-of-mouth marketing, and e-mail segmentation in order to reach new customers and create intimacy with existing ones,” the report states. “Combining merchandising expertise with automated technology will produce more relevant product recommendations and increase customers’ loyalty, as will offering custom products.”  Including travel, the survey found that online sales in 2003 grew 51% over the previous year to reach $114.1 billion.

       HIGHLIGHTS   RETAIL - EUROPE   Ahold Will Consider Takeovers in 2006    Dutch retailer Ahold will reportedly begin looking at takeovers again in 2006, the retailer's c.f.o. was quoted as saying, Reuters reports.  Although no concrete plans have been discussed, Hannu Ryopponen, Ahold's c.f.o., told Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad: "At around that time we will be ready to write a check for two to three billion euros. I would rather not invest a lot, but would be prepared to do so for a good acquisition."  Ahold, which has been struggling to recover after admitting to overstating earnings by more than U.S. $1 billion in 2000-2002, will reportedly eye takeovers in Europe in an effort to lessen an imbalance of its income structure, which currently generates 72 percent of sales in the United States, according to the newspaper report. Acknowledging that the company's first priority this year and next was recovering from the accounting scandal, Ryopponen was quoted as saying: "It would be idiotic to go on the takeover path while the ship is still leaking. You cannot do too much that is new. First, we must be rid of the credit agencies' junk bond status. Then we will be ready for growth."  Noting that the company's U.S. focus will continue to be directed to strengthening its Stop & Shop and Carlisle, Pa.-based Giant Food Stores unit, Ryopponen said Stop & Shop's sales could double in 10 years through new store openings and small acquisitions. Last week Ahold received a "serious warning" from Euronext, a European stock exchange, which officially reprimanded the global food retailer for breaking market rules by delaying the disclosure of accounting problems that had it near bankruptcy last year.

Self-Checkout Transactions to Surpass $330 Billion Annually by 2007   Self-service shopping will generate transactions worth $70 billion in 2004, according to a new study from IHL Consulting Group . The study forecasts that the value of these transactions will increase to over $330 billion by 2007 as many more systems are deployed in the next few years.  The "2004 North American Self-Checkout Systems Market Study" details the trends as well as the quantitative functions of the self-checkout market, including system shipments, installed base, market value, key technology vendors, and the value of transactions through these systems.  The report also includes a four-year forecast for shipments, installed base and market value, and an analysis of projected penetration in key retail segments.  "We live in an age where self-sufficiency often reigns supreme, and time is at a premium," said Greg Buzek, president of IHL Consulting Group, an analyst firm and consultancy that serves retailers and retail technology vendors. "New self-service technologies are emerging that will revolutionize the way we shop for goods and services.  The report provides data, charts, and graphs on self-checkout trends and challenges, key vendors, retail segments, market opportunities, and forecasts. Some key insights from the report:   - 	In stores currently using self-checkout systems, as much as 40 percent of the total number of transactions now go through the self-checkout, allowing retailers to provide more customer assistance within the aisles to help customers find products.  - 	More and more retail segments are adopting self-checkout. The Home Depot now has more than 3,200 lanes installed.  - 	The key technology players in self-checkout are NCR, IBM, and Fujitsu TransactionSolutions. NCR is currently the dominant player, but IBM and Fujitsu have recently entered the market through key acquisitions, bringing with them significant point-of-sale success.  "The No. 1 challenge facing retailers of all sizes is, 'How do we compete with Wal-Mart?'" said Buzek, adding that self-checkout systems are allowing retailers to move labour from checkouts to other areas of the store, creating a differentiation in customer service that can be used to compete with the world's largest retailer.

Supermarkets, Packaged Food Companies Top National Customer Service Poll   Supermarkets and packaged food companies top the list of industries that scored the best marks for serving their customers, according to an annual Harris Poll ranking 15 industries on how well they serve consumers.  Fully 87 percent of the survey's respondents believe supermarkets do a good job of serving their consumers, while 77 percent said the same of packaged food companies. Next on the list come airlines, at 74 percent, followed by computer hardware (73 percent), banks (73 percent), and software (72 percent) companies. At the bottom of the list, only 30 percent think tobacco companies and managed care companies do a good job. Oil companies, with 32 percent, are only marginally better. The Harris Poll was based on a survey of 979 adults surveyed by telephone between April 8 and 15. The polling organization said the substantial changes between 2003 and 2004 concerned airlines, which fell very sharply in 2001 but have bounced back, going from 64 percent last year to 74 percent this year. The airlines' score depicts a 23 percent increase since the airlines' lowest number, 51 percent in 2001. By contrast, oil companies have slipped 10 points this year, from 42 percent in 2003 to 32 percent, a decline of 32 percentage points since their best number, 64 percent, in 1998.

The company also announced plans for a £700m share buyback over the next two years.   This sent the shares up 43.5 to 675.5p, making it the second-biggest riser in the FTSE 100 yesterday. The news cheered investors, who were shocked just seven weeks ago when the company revealed a £390m investment plan that would hit profits. However, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's cut the 150-year-old group's rating two notches to A- on fears that it would have less cash to pay off debt. The group's net debt at the end of the year to March rose £97m to £149m.  Mr Baker, who was working behind the tills at the Boots store on Cannon Street on Tuesday, said: "We do expect some degree of disruption from the investment." However, he was bullish about the prospects for the company, whose 1,400-strong chemists chain accounts for 90pc of profits.  Boots, which took a £16m hit from voluntary redundancies, said cost cuts and rising sales, up to £5.325m from £5.320m, helped offset lower prices. Boots unveiled a 6.6pc rise in operating profit to £531m, while same-store sales rose 3.9pc, against growth of 4.8pc last year.  However, the chemist chain suffered a fall in operating margin to 11.9pc from 13.3pc, due to cutting prices 18pc on 2,000 products. The photography division struggled with the tradtional development business down 12pc and overall down 6pc.  Meanwhile, the optician and dentalcare business saw losses narrowed to £5m from £31m and the international arm reported losses down to £10.4m from £22m. Boots also said 15pc of its pension funds assets would be transferred out of bonds, although Mr Baker said: "This is not a view on where the equity market is."

Interest in German investment.    Europe. Moscow is a city that is changing at lightning speed. West European companies who'd like to take part in this economic development will have to change their perceptions.   The rules are not exactly known for their clarity and potential investors have a hard time getting to grips with things. As the Russian poet Fjodor Tjutschev once said, "Russia can neither be understood with intellect nor with a measuring stick," and this is as true today as it ever was. No wonder that the first question that investors ask is what are the chances in this country and how high are the risks? Where are the bad guys? How can I find the good ones? Managers who don't have the guts or who get ensnared by false prophets will never get the doors open.    Opportunities abound   Having said that, consultants such as A.T. Kearney and the Federation of German Economists in the Russian Federation report that the city stands for growth. "The opportunities in Russia are close at hand. The German economy must not, and will not, miss the boat."  Siegfried Hübner, a German marketing consultant, has been keeping his eye on the city's development for two years, and he is keen to pass his knowledge on to the new Federation of Russian-European Entrepreneurs.   The federation's goals are quick to explain. The transfer of know-how to both retailers and manufacturers for successful market penetration, the development and support of investment strategies, as well as the creation of specific contact networks.    Good food, good business   These contacts are particularly important, and this is something that Cesim Cacan, a German-Turkish restaurateur knows all too well. The various restaurants he operates in Moscow, such as Bosfor, Route 66, Kebab fast food places and ethnic food restaurants have brought him wealth and prestige.  He is chairman of the Preussisch Gesellschaft Berlin Brandenburg and realised very early on which opportunities lie waiting in Moscow, a city with more than 20 million inhabitants.  He is also vice-president of the Turkish-Russian Association and has a widespread and prestigious gastronomic network. His company ABA Handelslogistik acts as supplier to such well-known retailers as Metro, Auchan, Marktkauf or the Russian Ramstore.    Turkish network   Turkish is the common language in his restaurant Bospor, it is a popular meeting place for many Turkish entrepreneurs. One of his guests is sometimes Haluk Bozoðlu, vice-president of Günal Construction Trading & Industry Co. Inc., a construction company specialising in bridges, dams and, nowadays, shopping malls. It belongs to the Ankara-based conglomerate MNG Group.  Bozoðlu's company is currently building a fantastic shopping mall on a premium sight at Puschkin Square. When asked if this would be a good address for German food retailers, Bozoðlu replied that basically, of course, yes, but he doubted whether they could achieve the rents.    Astronomic rents   He is planning on square meter prices that seem astronomical, anywhere between 900 and 1000 US dollars. Metro would have to sell nothing but caviar in Germany for years before being able to afford rents like these. Of course Bozoðlu could build more affordable sites, for instance for stores like Kaufland, Minimal or Plus, in fact his company has already secured relevant sites. But even these would charge rents of around 180 US dollars per square meter, much higher than any charged for greenfield sites in Germany.  In a neighbouring table in Bozoðlu's restaurant Bosfor there is another German business man with a thorough knowledge of the Russian market, Michael Deines. He is an advertising and marketing specialist who has been working on projects for Rewe and Tengelmann.    A simple message   He "got stuck" in Moscow, so to speak, after the completion of a project for the AVA subsidiary Marktkauf Rus, and now operates an advertising agency with a Russian partner.  Deines has plenty to report about German-Russian business dealings, as well as about day to day business. Although he can now read Russian, he still chooses to count the stations of the legendary Moscow Metro system rather than relying on his reading skills. Just to make sure. He has a simple message to pass onto any entrepreneurial-minded retailer: the only mistake anyone can make is not to open at all.    Modern Russian managers   Someone else with deep-seated wisdom of what is happening here is Andrei Gorski, in fact one could say that he is the archetype modern Russian manager. He is extremely well-educated, speaks several languages, open-minded and oozes self-confidence.  In his mid-thirties, Gorski joined Tengelmann in the mid 1990s, was managing director of the Russian subsidiary of its production company Wissol between 1995 and 2001. This was followed by a period as head of non-food procurement at the AVA subsidiary Marktkauf Rus.   Calling on dynamics   Both he and the Russian Department of Trade and Industry, which invited Lebensmittel Zeitung to Moscow, are more than a little disappointed in AVA's reticence to get on with its expansion in the Russian capital. The government had hoped that the company would be quite a bit more dynamic. Gorski, who is also consultant to Tigran A. Karachanov, Russia's Minister of Economics and responsible for the conurbation around Moscow called Oblast, is particularly interested in the success of German companies in this area. The area is in direct competition with Moscow itself. The political leaders of the region, led by its governor Boris Gromov, would like to convince more investors of the advantages of setting up operations in Oblast.    Beyond Moscow's doors  Gorski waxes lyrical about the advantages that the region has to offer, taking care to draw attention to the growing traffic congestion in the capital itself and the exorbitantly high rents. "The margins to be achieved here were last achieved in Germany 30 years ago." Minister Karachanov's message is quite simple: he would like to see German companies investing in his region, and Gorski is the man to help when it comes to first steps and speeding things up.    Where funds flow ...  Gorski doesn't hide the fact that corruption still exists, but what actually is to be classed as such is difficult to say. Money paid to the authorities for services such as security and health, for instance, does not end up in the pockets of the staff there. Instead it is paid into a kind of social fund, says consultant Siegfried Hübner, and is part of the country's business system. Some companies work closely with the ministries and supply food to kindergartens, others supply the offices of the welfare service with modern equipment and still others have delivered air-conditioning units to a controlling institution.    . . . and if they don't  Not so long ago, the Swedish furniture giant Ikea discovered that it was not always such a good idea to show reluctance to ideas put forward. A regional authority put its foot down about the erection of a new building because, it was said, environmental demands had not been fulfilled. Metro Group, which has strict behavioural rules for expansion into foreign countries, just as Ikea does, realised quite early on that in Russia's case "ministers have to be treated the same way that business partners are".    Connections is the name of the game   It is of paramount importance to have the right connections to the right offices if a business venture is to be successful and carried through without any major hassles. Those who do not heed this maxim often end up paying for their misjudgement.  The security services, often run by former military players, play a major role here. The call themselves services providers, and their service is to iron out problems between state agencies and the investors in a pragmatic way. Although Lebensmittel Zeitung would have liked to hear more about this subject, the interview with Tigran Karachonov, aged 60, draws to a close. The 30 minutes that were planned ended up as 45, although this included several mobile phone conversations.     European companies considered slow   Karachonov, who is keen to extol the advantages for German investors opening up shop in the region, wonders why there are so many negative reports about business in Russia, while at the same time the list of interested parties is growing longer by the day. Maybe VW will be building a factory after all? Talks have not broken down entirely yet although the car builders want special treatment in the form of a reduced VAT rate for its cars. "Agreeing to such a demand would put our own car manufacturers at a disadvantage.  The minister is also surprised that German food retailers often take such a long time to get going. "Russians tend to take a long time to prepare things, but when the decision has been made then we pull the whole thing through quickly."  This is probably a stab at Rewe who was presented with various options for the Oblast region already a year ago. Although it would like to, Lebensmittel Zeitung is unable, at present, to report that Rewe is taking Penny to Russia.    The road to Eldorado   There are plenty of shopping centers lining the roads leading out of Moscow, and the names filling them are all too familiar: Metro, Obi, Ikea and Auchan.   A quick look into Auchan shows plenty of German products on the shelves. "Saturday is so busy," says Wolfgang Deines that all 86 checkouts have to be opened.  Another French company, the dairy group Danone recently opened a new production facility south of Moscow. The French company plans to increase its turnover in Russia by 30 per cent this year, and the new plant will certainly help it to achieve this goal.  The Department of Trade and Industry lists quite a few German companies who have already set up in this region around Moscow. Ritter Sport (chocolate) EUR 15 million, completion 2005; Hochland (cheese) USD 35 million; Ehrmann (dairy) USD 30 million; Döhler (fruit concentrates) EUR 5 million; Obi (DIY) EUR 25 million; Metro (C+C) EUR 100 million and Marktkauf (Hypermarket/DIY) 32 million.   All in all, it can be said that the region's favourable strategic position is truly a region with a promising future, and the governmental agencies see further growth on the backs of western investments.

       HIGHLIGHTS  E-BUSINESS – INTERNET   Amazon Testing "Plogs"    First Amazon.com recommended products that it thought its customers would find interesting. Now it's taking advantage of the blogging phenomenon by topping its home page with a personalized "Plog," a blog-style feature that links to recommended products and provides relevant information.    "Your Amazon.com Plog is a diary of events that will enhance your shopping experience, helping you discover products that have just been released, track changes to your orders, and many other things," the company says on its site. "Just like a blog, your Plog is sorted in reverse chronological order. When we think we have something interesting or important to tell you, we'll post it to your Plog."  The Plog feature is still in beta testing.  "The goal of the plog service is to provide users with an easy way to keep current on events that are relevant to them," said Craig Berman, director of platform and technology communications at Amazon, in an e-mail exchange. "The service is designed to further enhance the customer experience by providing personalized information, including product recommendations, order updates and other Amazon.com content in one convenient location."  The information that appears in the Plog is driven by Amazon's database of information about a user -- previous purchases and ratings of products. One entry begins: "'The Rule of Four' was released today; We thought you'd be interested because you rated 'The Da Vinci Code'." Following that introduction is a Publishers Weekly review of the newly released book. Each book mention links to its Amazon product page.  To allay privacy concerns, Amazon allows users to opt out of having purchase details shown on the Plog in their account preferences area.  While many businesses, most notably Amazon partner Google, have launched blogs to communicate with the public, the personalized nature of the Plog and its prominent home page placement make Amazon's approach unique. The Plog could almost be called the reverse of a blog. While blogs are usually highly personal diaries produced by an individual and read by others, the Amazon version is produced by a company (or a company's technology) and each version is personalized for just one individual.  So far, there appears to be no RSS feed of the Plog, though it would seem like a natural distribution method. Most blogging software generates an RSS or Atom feed automatically, and Amazon has been a pioneer in using RSS to distribute information about its products. Many marketers and publishers are looking to RSS as a spam-free alternative to e-mail newsletters. (Amazon wouldn't comment on whether an RSS feed is in the works.)  Amazon, through its subsidiary A9, has lately been experimenting with new ways of collecting and using data about its customers. A9 recently launched a search site that keeps a log of users' searches and site visits, also allowing them to keep notes about sites.

By picking up an extra pocketbook here, a pair of thrift-store-priced stilettos there, these moms in turn flip the items on eBay - essentially shopping their way to earnings.   Ever since founder Pierre M. Omidyar started the global bazaar by selling a broken laser pointer for $14, the eBay economy has given Mayan villagers a chance to sell their pottery to Park Avenue princesses and rural Kansas collectors an opportunity to vie against Christie's. Now, with the help of wireless technology, digital photography, and friendly postmen, eBay is becoming a hot new career for managerial-class moms. "Flexibility is a big part of it. But they also get the opportunity to do something they enjoy," says eBay Inc. CEO and President Margaret C. Whitman. "Often these women are trading in areas they have always been passionate about."  Today, upwards of 430,000 people in the U.S. alone - more than are employed worldwide by General Electric Co. and Procter & Gamble combined - earn a full- or part-time living on eBay selling everything from fashion to farm equipment, with the highest-sellers grossing up to $1 million a month. Of the estimated 48% of these sellers who are women, many are "mompreneurs" - corporate stopouts who have found in eBay a way to tap into an international marketplace from their kitchen tables and finesse a saner work-life balance at the same time. It's no coincidence that the rise of the eBay mompreneurs comes as more highly educated women are choosing to stay at home with young children. The percentage of working women with children under the age of one dropped from a record 59% in 1998 to 55% in 2002, after rising steadily for 30 years. Some see the decrease as a referendum on the work-life balance. As in, it doesn't exist.   Megasellers  On eBay, however, says Marsha Collier, author of the bestselling Starting an eBay Business for Dummies, "there's no commuting. No back-stabbing. No office politics. No glass ceiling. No need to waste gas. No waiting in line at the post office, because they'll pick up for free. I mean, how much better could it be?"  For former Dow Chemical Co. engineer Kim Kincaid of Leavenworth, Kan., not much. She began selling antiques on eBay in 1998 as a hobby (her first coup: a $7.50 Pillsbury Doughboy cookie jar that sold for $75). Today she moves at least $100,000 worth of antiques and rare books a month. But she is still able to arrange her schedule around her four- and 10-year-old sons. "When women look at the workforce once they have children," says Kincaid, who now runs the business with her husband, sister, and parents, "they say: 'I'm going to be working for $2 an hour after child care and not having all that time with my kids."'  Ann Whitley Wood, a Stanford University grad who has a law degree from the University of Texas at Austin, quit her job as an appellate attorney at Dallas blue-chip firm Haynes and Boone in 2000 after her second of three children was born. She simply couldn't figure out a way to make the job work part-time. Yet as a buyer on eBay, she was dumbfounded by the volume sellers were doing. So she started experimenting. (Her first sale: an old evening gown hanging in her closet, $400). In 2002, she got more professional, scouring last-call sales for Lilly Pulitzer dresses and Kate Spade handbags. She now makes a decent part-time income.  The idea of selling on eBay came to Elise Wetzel as a way to raise funds for her kids' preschool. Holding a virtual garage sale on eBay seemed like a better idea than pushing overpriced candy or tired wrapping paper. Wetzel, a former director of marketing at Unilever, quit her job after attending her Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management reunion in the summer of 2002. Of all the women there who had two kids, she was the only one who was still working. "It was like I missed the memo," she says. After the school fund-raiser, she was hooked and today has an eBay business called iSold It, which is fast developing into a chain of online consignment stores.  EBay, experts say, is a welcome, recession-proof option for many women, especially since it makes a virtue of the very traits that are often perceived as weaknesses in Corporate America. Research shows, for example, that women's detail-oriented strengths - as well as their tendency to bear down and have lunch at their desks - are impediments to advancement. On eBay, those so-called shortcomings become a competitive advantage, allowing women to provide the kind of high-touch customer service - the Holy Grail among buyers - that the big retailers just can't give. The real test now will be how the eBay entry on the updated résumé plays when they try to return to the corporate world. That is, if they even want to.

Abandoned shopping carts an e-tail challenge   More e-tail browsers are turning into buyers-but many are still abandoning their shopping carts before completing a transaction, a study has shown.   The number of shoppers who end up buying something has gone up from 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2003 to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2004, online marketing company DoubleClick said in a report released Wednesday. But for every dollar sold, $5 was left in an abandoned cart, DoubleClick said. "It's encouraging to see conversion rates increasing, although abandoned shopping carts still represent an enormous opportunity cost," Court Cunningham, senior vice president at the company, said in a statement.  Although returning customers are just 1 percent of all Web site visitors, they spend the most time - 7.69 minutes on average--and money, about $180 every session, DoubleClick said. Nonbuyers accounted for 95 percent of all visitors but added up to 78 percent of the abandoned carts, the market researcher said. The study was based on data culled by the company's Web site measurement software, which analyzed the habits of 160 million Web site visitors.  E-commerce Web sites have recently been reporting higher sales. In the first quarter of 2004, sales grew by 28.1 percent, compared with the same period last year.

MARKET   Retail Sales Rise, Led by Spring Clothing   U.S. retail sales rose in May as shoppers splurged on spring clothing, undeterred by the impact of rising gasoline prices on household budgets.   Most retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Gap Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp., outperformed sales expectations for the month, picking up pace from a weak April when they reported their sales on Thursday.  Demand for items such as apparel, electronics and food helped offset the effects of waning tax refunds and a late U.S. Memorial Day, which pushed some sales into June. The companies' outlooks were "limited and somewhat mixed," said Ken Perkins, an analyst for research firm Thomson First Call.   Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, rose 5.9 percent last month. That was at the high end of its 4 percent to 6 percent target range for the four weeks ended May 28.  The increase came even after the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company had warned that high prices at the gas pump - which are costing the average American an additional $7 a week - could cut into the pockets of its more than 100 million weekly customers.  Wal-Mart forecast same-store sales will rise at the low end of a 4 percent to 6 percent range in June. Its stock gained 82 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $57.14 on the New York Stock Exchange in late morning trade.   Gas prices have topped $2 a gallon across the United States as the price of crude oil has soared to record highs.  Costco said its May same-store sales jumped 16 percent, well above expectations, on demand for food, electronics and gasoline. The largest U.S. warehouse club operator also sells gasoline at some of its stores.  Discounter Target Corp. said its same-store sales climbed 4.6 percent, roughly in line with its forecast.  Not all flourished. Sears, Roebuck and Co., the largest U.S. department store operator, projected same-store sales would be flat to down slightly in the second quarter, following a worse-than-expected drop in May.   Lackluster children's and home goods businesses weighed on sales at department store chains Dillard's Inc. and May Department Stores Co., and home furnishings retailer Pier 1 Imports Inc. cut its quarterly profit view due to a disappointing holiday promotion.  J.C. Penney Co. Inc. which posted a 9.1 percent rise in May same-store sales on a strong Mother's Day, also noted "concerns over the impact that higher energy prices" are having on the consumer.  The S&P Retailing index was down Thursday morning but recovered at midday and was up 0.5 percent at 407.59.    Clothing a hit in May  Upscale spring clothing was a bigger hit with shoppers compared with the same month last year, giving a sales boost to department stores such as Federated Department Stores Inc. and Nordstrom Inc., which surpassed analysts' forecasts.  "The mix of sales is good, discounting is under control, and inventory levels are in good shape," said Darrell Rigby, head of Bain & Co.'s global retail practice.   Specialty apparel companies were standouts, including women's chains Talbots Inc. with a better-than-expected 8.1 percent rise, and Limited Brands Inc., which posted a 3 percent increase on robust demand at its Victoria's Secret chain.   Gap, the biggest U.S. specialty apparel retailer, posted a better-than-anticipated 6 percent rise in May same-store sales, driven by summer merchandise such as tank tops and skirts.  "Rising oil prices have slowed consumer spending somewhat. But with incomes rising, the consumer is (spending) a little bit extra," analyst Claire Gallacher of Caris & Co. said, noting that freer spending on clothing was a good sign for the economy.

According to reports, Kraft disclosed the decision in a progress report on the anti-obesity initiatives it announced last July. With the food industry facing growing consumer health concerns and the risk of obesity lawsuits, Kraft had pledged to change some product recipes, reduce portions in some single-serve packages, quit marketing snacks via giveaways at schools, and encourage healthier lifestyles.  "When we spoke with consumers about what they wanted with single-serve, what they told us was that they didn't want us to reduce the size because they wanted to have more choice," Kraft spokeswoman Kris Charles said yesterday. "Different people have different body sizes and activity levels, and it made more sense to provide different portion choices."  Kraft said is still planning to offer a broad range of portion-size choices, including snacks in small packages, such as its new Nabisco 100 Calorie Packs. It also will give nutrition information for entire packages, rather than just for individual portions, to make it easier for consumers to make nutritional decisions. That move, Kraft said, should support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's recent call for food companies to enhance labeling on packages in a way that helps consumers make informed decisions.  Kraft has also reduced the fat content and made other changes to about 200 products it sells in North America, accounting for about 5 percent of its products.

New York-based Rheingold Brewing Co. has teamed up with Greenpoint Beer Works, which will produce from 1,000 to 2,000 barrels of Rheingold at its Waverly Ave. brewery.  The beer is expected to be sold initially in local bars and restaurants. Rheingold was established in 1850 and soon became a New York favorite. For almost 30 years Rheingold was the most requested beer in the New York area. In addition to Brooklyn, the company operated breweries in Orange, N.J. and other locations, but in the 1960s it began to lose sales and market share to Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and other larger companies. The company filed for bankruptcy and shut down in 1976. In 1999, Walter "Terry" Liebman, a descendant of Rheingold's founding family, re-established the brand. The bulk of the company's product is being produced at an upstate contract brewery.

       HIGHLIGHTS   RETAIL – PRICE STRATEGIES   Asda to cut petrol prices again    Supermarket chain Asda has unveiled a fresh round of petrol price reductions - cutting the cost of a litre by 1p.  Asda said that from Wednesday the price of unleaded petrol and diesel at its UK forecourts would be 78.9p a litre.  Britain's second biggest grocer cut petrol prices by 2p a litre last Thursday, prompting a wave of similar reductions by rivals.  Asda said its decision had been made possible by the falling cost of oil on the world market.  Petrol pledge Paul Mancey, Asda's trading director, said: "We all had to pay higher prices when costs went up and we should all be paying less now. Our customers, quite rightly, expect nothing less."  The company operates 150 petrol stations across the UK.  Responding to Asda's announcement, supermarket rival Sainsbury's said it would also be looking to cut prices.  A spokeswoman for the firm said: "In line with our policy of selling the cheapest petrol where we trade, we will be undercutting Asda again."

Its marketing is slick and Coke is the best-selling soft drink in the world.  Few would have predicted that Coke's attempt to launch its Dasani bottled water brand in the UK would prove to be a disaster for such an experienced company.   Yet, in March this year, only five weeks after its multi million pound UK launch, red-faced Coke executives were forced to take Dasani off the shelves in the UK.  What went wrong?  Dasani was launched in the USA in 1999 as a bottled, purified water, and had become a huge success there. Taking that same formula and repeating it for the UK market must have looked like a breeze, but that wasn't quite how it turned out.  Unlike most of the bottled water sold in British petrol stations and supermarkets Dasani hadn't come from alpine glaciers or trickled out of a precious natural spring - it had come out of the local tap. True, the company put it through a purification process and added mineral salts, but the source was still tap water.  At its launch on 10 February, some people in the drinks industry already knew Dasani's big "secret". Simon Mowbray of The Grocer magazine had mentioned the source of the water in an article, but didn't think anyone else would pick up on it. Now, he sees it more graphically. "It was a bomb waiting to go off," he says.    The Real Sting   At first, the launch seemed to have go well, and Coke executives thought the public would respond to their new product with its distinctive blue packaging. But everything changed when the Press Association reporter Graham Hiscott saw the reference in the Grocer magazine to the real source of Dasani.  The following day, the story was splashed across the daily papers. Headlines like "The Real Sting" a play on Coke's "The Real Thing" slogan and the more obvious "Coke sells tap water for 95p" could hardly have been worse for Coke and their new baby.  The tabloids drew on the uncanny parallel with the episode in the BBC sitcom "Only Fools and Horses", in which Del Boy and Rodney take ordinary tap water from their Peckham flat and bottle it up to sell as Peckham Spring. The irony couldn't have been worse. Dasani was sourced and bottled in a factory in Sidcup, just a few miles down the road from Peckham! The tabloids continued their onslaught. "Are they taking us for plonkers!" yelled the Daily Star.    Contaminated   Despite the pages of negative press coverage, Coke persisted with Dasani. Executives protested that they had been misunderstood and that the drink was not just tap water but in fact the result of a highly sophisticated process to create the purest drinking water you can get. As far as Coke were concerned, Dasani was a lifestyle drink, a drink you would want to be seen with, the source was all but irrelevant.  Then on Thursday 18 March there was even worse news.  Something had gone wrong at the Dasani factory and a bad batch of minerals had contaminated the water production with a potentially carcinogenic bromate. Coke admitted defeat. Immediately they withdrew all 500,000 bottles of Dasani in circulation. In just five weeks, Dasani had come and gone, arguably providing more in terms of entertainment than refreshment.  The cost to Coke is thought to run into the millions, but behind the financial loss is the possibility of an even more serious problem. After years of heady growth, sales of Coca-Cola are beginning to flatten out. Bottled water, by contrast, is now the fastest-growing of the soft drinks and Coke still need a successful bottled water for the UK and the European market.  An organisation the size of Coke, with the marketing strength that has made it the biggest drinks company in the world, is unlikely to give up easily. Astonishingly, Dasani could make a comeback one day. Asked whether the company has any plans to bring Dasani back, Patricia McNamara, New Beverages Director at coca cola GB says coyly, "we like to think it's a definite maybe".

"El Corte Ingles hasn't made any offer on the Dutch group Ahold," a company spokeswoman was quoted by Dow Jones International News as saying. Earlier this week a report in a Spanish newspaper said that El Corte Ingles had made an offer of €480m (US$579.8m) for the assets, which include more than 600 stores. Ahold, which has made several major divestments in the last year as it seeks to cut debt in the wake of an accounting scandal, has said it hopes to sell its Spanish operations by the end of the year.

One market source said Woolworths was "hurting" because of the slow rollout of its petrol offer and that sales were "soft" because of competition from the fully realised Coles-Shell petrol alliance. The speculation follows a 4.9% rise in third-quarter supermarket sales.   After that result in April, chief executive Roger Corbett said improvements would come in the fourth quarter when the Caltex petrol agreement was finalised. The final agreement was signed two weeks later and the more than 90 Caltex sites were expected to be converted "immediately". At the time, Caltex had converted 41 of more than 130 sites slated for the alliance. A spokesman declined to comment on the sales figures. But he said that since the agreement was finalised, Woolworths had co-branded about 40 of its 310 Petrol Plus sites to Caltex, and was aiming to convert between 10 and 12 Petrol Plus sites a week.

The world has no comparable period of failure anywhere else in at least the last century, including the Great Depression. From 1960 to 1979, these economies grew at a decent rate, chalking up an 80% gain in income per person. In spite of Latin America having the world's worst inequality in income distribution, this was enough to substantially improve living standards for the vast majority of the population, including most of the poor.  But then something went wrong, and it has as much to do with policies advocated by the "Washington consensus." From 1980 to 1999, per-capita income grew by only 11%. The 1980s were known as Latin America's "lost decade," when the region's income per person actually fell. The 1990s produced only modest growth, and the first decade of the 21st century is now looking like it might also count itself among the missing. Using the International Monetary Fund's [IMF] projections for 2004, the first half of the new decade [2000-04] shows a gain of about 1% for the whole five years.    Mexico’s malaise;  Amazing, isn't it? One would think that after 25 years of reforms - opening up to international trade and investment, privatization of state-owned enterprises, enforcing budget and monetary discipline, and other measures that have caused quite a bit of pain and dislocation to the region's citizens - these countries would have something to show for it.  The fact that this problem has received so little attention is even more astounding. Remember, 2004 is also NAFTA's 10th anniversary. And while a number of press reports have hailed the huge increase in trade and foreign direct investment that Mexico has experienced over the last decade, few mentioned how low the growth rate has been.  This is comparable to evaluating a professional baseball player without including his batting average. He may be a great fielder and a good team player, but if he bats .125, can he make it in the major leagues? That's a fair analogy to Mexico's economic performance during the NAFTA decade: less then 1% annual growth in gross domestic product [GDP] per person - not even a quarter of what was achieved in the decades prior to 1980.    Economic growth  - not tariff reduction or a balanced budget - is what determines whether people have a higher standard of living than that of their parents or grandparents. And when the economy grows, it's at least possible to direct a larger share of the new income and wealth to people who are less well off. When the economy doesn't grow, it means that any gains at the bottom must come at the expense of someone else.    Lackluster at best;  When pressed, defenders of the "Washington consensus" reforms say we really shouldn't count the 1980s, since there was a lot of hangover from over-borrowing during the 1970s. They also say the growth in prior decades was unsustainable. But Latin America had decent growth for 30 years, going back to the 1950s, so the idea that it isn't sustainable is hard to fathom. South Korea maintained a per-capita growth rate averaging more than 6% annually - much higher than Latin America at its best - for four decades. And whatever Latin policy mistakes were made in the 1970s, it's a bit of a reach to keep blaming them for economic failure into the 21st century.  And it's fair to use 1980 as a dividing line for looking at Latin America's economic performance, because 1979 was a business-cycle peak for the U.S., which is the destination for about two-thirds of Latin America's exports. But even if we restrict our focus to the 1990s, the region's growth performance was lackluster: just 14% for the decade. If this is the best that can be done while the U.S. is enjoying its longest-running economic expansion in history, something is very wrong.  It's not hard to see what that might be. Look at Brazil, which once had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. From 1960-79, its per-capita income grew by 160%. If that growth had continued, the country would today have living standards approaching those of Western Europe. But it has grown at about one-eighth that rate since 1980. And in 2003, the Brazilian economy shrank.    Wrong prescription;  Yet Brazil's central bank is currently keeping short-term interest rates at 16%. With inflation running at about 6%, this means a real interest rate of more than 10%. That's terribly high for an economy struggling to come out of a recession. For comparison, the U.S. Federal Reserve has kept short-term rates at 1% more than two years into an economic recovery. Imagine if it had chosen 11% or 12% instead. There wouldn't have been much of a market for home mortgages or much chance of an economic recovery.  Brazil has also upped its primary budget surplus to 4.25% of GDP. Again, this is the opposite of what the U.S. does in response to a slow economy. America went from a budget surplus of 2% of GDP to a deficit of more than 4% - a stimulus of more than $6 trillion dollars - since the economy slowed down in 2001.   These kinds of procyclical economic policies are often promoted by the IMF, which is dominated by the Treasury Dept., and its partner, the World Bank. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz likes to joke that the IMF made a mathematical "sign error" on the blackboard back in the 1950s - writing a minus instead of a plus - and hasn't corrected it yet.  More independence and departures from the "Washington consensus" will be needed if Latin America is to resume a normal growth path. And they probably will be forthcoming. But it would help if more policymakers north of the Rio Grande were at least willing to recognize that they may not know what's best for their Southern neighbors.

Yet pricing remains misunderstood and poorly managed, according to The Price Advantage, a new book by three consultants at McKinsey & Company. Even executives at highly successful companies may not fully appreciate how small changes in price can lead to large changes in profitability.    Several software programs have been developed in recent years to help companies strengthen their pricing capabilities. But the authors – Michael V. Marn, Eric V. Roegner and Craig C. Zawada – argue that companies can truly achieve the price advantage only by making deep and lasting changes in their organizations. Such a major shift takes time, they say, but the effort can pay big dividends. Wharton marketing professor David J. Reibstein recently spoke to Marn, a partner in McKinsey’s Cleveland office, about the major themes that he and his co-authors discuss in the book. Over the years, Marn has developed some of the most widely used analytics for identifying pricing opportunities.    Reibstein:  Mike, a good place for us to start is with you defining what you mean by the price advantage.    Marn:  When we talk about the price advantage what we mean is not that a company has a product with a low price relative to competition.  We’ve got a much more holistic definition.  We think of price advantage as a superior capability to use price as a source of real competitive advantage that at the end of the day makes your company more successful. You’ll often hear companies talk about their other advantages. They’ll talk about a purchasing advantage or a cost advantage or an innovation advantage or a distribution advantage or a service advantage.  You never hear them talking about having a price advantage - that they price better than their competitors do.   What we’ve observed over the years, and one reason we wrote the book, is that we had so many clients that worked so very hard to create advantages in other areas only to give them away because they didn’t have the price advantage, because they didn’t know how to price to make sure that the advantages they created really delivered benefit.  Why bother to work so very hard to cut your costs if you’re just going to pass it on to your customers without taking anything for yourself? Why bother to work as hard to innovate if you’re just going to charge the same price for the old product that you’re replacing? Why bother working so hard to be a high-service provider if you’re going to match the price of a low-service provider in the marketplace? In a lot of ways, the price advantage is more than just an advantage unto itself. It’s an advantage that enables companies to realize the benefits of the other advantages they work so hard to create.    Reibstein:  My understanding of a cost advantage is that I have lower costs. My understanding of a distribution advantage is that I have easier access to distribution. But you’re not talking about a higher price or being able to command a higher price or charge a lower price than the competition.    Marn:  No. We're talking about having the capability to come up with the right price more consistently. I would insist that the mistake most companies make, if you look at it over time, is they typically price too low. They have real benefits for which they don’t charge appropriately. The error bias is much more toward companies under-pricing. But at the same time, having the price advantage would let you know when you are indeed pricing too high and appropriately adjusting downward when that makes sense. It’s not about always being too high or too low. It’s about understanding the power of having the right price for as many transactions in the market as you can.    Reibstein: You make a strong point in the book about how you can leverage a small price change into big profit changes, and I think you articulate that pretty well. I’m curious how you see the tradeoff between price and market share, where the price advantage happens to lead to more of a short-term profit advantage versus going for market share, which might gain you a longer-term advantage in terms of distribution or, ultimately, lower costs.    Marn:  That’s a good question. I think you have to read The Price Advantage in the context of overall strategy. In other words, what we’re talking about in most cases is, against the backdrop of the strategic decisions you make, how can you manage pricing? If indeed a management team says, ‘We need to have 35% market share or more in this particular market to survive, to support our infrastructure, to run our plants at adequate capacity,’ then we would suggest that even if you pursue that 35% market share, there are things you can do to maximize your price that will likely improve your profitability.    Reibstein:  Is the issue of price critical across all industries? Let me tell you why I’m asking that question. I was looking at the numbers that you threw out for where a company gets leverage on price and it’s more the case for companies that have very high variable costs. I was wondering about industries where the variable costs are quite low, such as the airline industry or software. I was wondering how critical you think the pricing component is in those contexts?         Marn:  I would make the case that the pricing lever is crucially important in all situations. What you often see happening in high fixed-cost, low variable-cost businesses is that, despite the fact that gross margins are very high, it’s not uncommon for actual operating profits, or earnings before interest and taxes, to be relatively thin. So the leverage of improving pricing is just as high on the bottom line. The way it trades off versus volume might be a bit different. But, that said, the upside of improving pricing is still equally powerful. Quite frankly, I think the one time I would take care about backing away from a strategy driven by understanding very carefully the tradeoff between price and volume and margin, would be a situation where you think your market is growing very, very quickly -- in other words, situations where early penetration into a market or development of markets is crucially important. But any market that has grown to maturity where growth rates aren’t wild and where competitors have settled in – the payoff of doing this well, whether you have a heavy fixed cost or heavy variable cost structure, is extremely high.    Reibstein:  What readership do you envision for the book?    Marn:  We wrote this book for individuals in businesses who have a role in pricing. We believe there’s a role for the general manager, the CEO. There’s a role for the VP of marketing. There’s a role for the product manager. There’s a role for the sales manager. There’s a role for the salespeople. We wrote this book for the whole range of individuals up and down the hierarchy of most organizations who play a role in pricing decision-making.    Reibstein:  What was your motivation for writing the book?    Marn:  At McKinsey we’ve been doing pricing work as a major part of our marketing efforts for the better part of 20 years. It’s one of the largest single function areas of marketing in which we help clients. The thing that’s amazing is, you would think that after 20 years there would be a bit of a collective awareness of the pricing opportunity and of the basic frameworks and tools to create price advantage in organizations. It continued to amaze us that we would go into some business units of very good companies, Fortune 1000 companies, companies all around the world, and start talking about pricing as if we just turned on the light bulb for the first time. Our thought was by writing this book we could give managers a practical way of understanding and capturing this still-elusive opportunity for so many companies. Twenty years ago, I would have thought, golly, there wouldn’t be a need for a book like this because everyone had signed on to the powerful ideas around pricing. But we’re sitting here in 2004 with 50% of companies not being good at this. It’s one of the biggest surprises of my professional life.    Reibstein:  Actually, I share in that amazement and, frankly, some disappointment that industry is not moving along a lot faster.    Marn:  When you find a company that is really good at pricing, it goes beyond doing the Excel spreadsheets. Courage is required to really nail this. A lot of companies don’t do a very good job of creating the institutional courage to price right. It’s easier not to price well. It’s easier to cave in when customers ask for low prices, or competitors lob a low price into a situation. It takes a lot of intestinal fortitude to do it well. I’m wondering out loud if that behavior has prevented this from catching on like other more cut-and-dried management function improvement processes over the years.    Reibstein:  Are there some industries where you think achieving price advantage is more developed than others?    Marn:  I cannot point to one industry and say 80% do this well. It comes down more to individual players in a variety of industries.    Reibstein:  I’ve been surprised to see how well the chemical industry does it.    Marn:  I think a few chemical companies have really stepped up their game in pricing in the last five years or so. But I cannot point to a single industry where the top five players all do pricing well. Typically, you find zero or one in an industry that do it really, really well. Or maybe two. And that, to me, is what’s so exciting about pursuit of the price advantage.  It’s not something everyone has already. It is still an advantage that can really cause you to stand out in terms of your performance. This is not about playing catch-up. This is about getting out ahead and investing in creating an advantage that most others in your industry probably don’t have already.   Even industries that invest tens of millions of dollars in pricing processes and systems don’t do it all that well. Look at the airlines. For all the sophistication they have in how they price, the performance of airlines today is not that great. You wouldn’t put a big part of your investment portfolio into airlines. In the specialty chemical industry a couple of players do it really well.  In consumer packaged goods there are a couple that do it well and a bunch that don’t. You look at service industry and there are a minority that do it well and most don’t. You go right down the list and there’s no one industry you can point to and say across the board this is one industry that’s got it really nailed.    Reibstein:   I want to pick up on something you said earlier - that there’s always a temptation to cave in. Where do prices really end up being set in a company? You talk in the book about how pricing departments have sprung up in companies in the last 10 years. But it’s one thing to have the price set at corporate and another thing when you get down to the front line where the salesperson is talking to the customer. First of all, how much of whatever ends up happening concerning pricing really happens on the front line rather than at corporate? And, second, how much leeway should you give the sales force in determining prices?    Marn:  That’s a very rich question, and it’s one that I think is misunderstood by a lot of companies. I have seen companies price exceedingly well with very centralized pricing processes and very decentralized pricing processes. By centralized, I mean all price decisions are made at headquarters. By decentralized, I mean there is considerable discretionary authority to discount price out in the field. Now, I think the mistake a lot of companies make is they say, ‘You know, my sales people have no price discretion. Any price discount that they want to grant customers, they need to get approval from the “pricing desk.’” One would think with that control, or lack of field discretion, that they would have the pricing process under control and that nothing bad is going to happen. But that’s exactly the wrong point of view.   No matter whether your pricing authority is centralized or decentralized, something very crucial happens at the salesperson/customer interface.  Even without pricing authority, what you’ll find is the best salespeople, the ones who really understand customers well and know how to sell value, will actually end up charging higher prices. And their customers end up, even if the pricing is centralized, going back to the central pricing desk with fewer price-discount requests. So I would suggest that whether the salesperson has field pricing authority at a high or low level, it doesn’t matter. He or she is always going to be a crucial cog in the creation of a price advantage in an organization.  That would be point number one.  Point number two builds on the idea that companies can be successful at very centralized and very decentralized pricing. The connection to make is this: The more decentralized your pricing process - that is, the more pricing authority you push out to the field, be it to regional managers, district managers or salespeople - the higher level of pricing skill you need to build in those people. You also need a higher level of monitoring of their performance. And you need a higher level of incentives tied to pricing in their compensation plans. A lot of companies push pricing authority out to the field, but they’ll fail to create those three conditions for success.    Reibstein:  I think that’s an excellent point. I’m particularly intrigued by your observations on technology’s role in pricing. Do you want to talk a little bit about what you see as the role of technology today and where you see it going?    Marn:  What you’re seeing now is a number of software companies filling that gap that existed maybe 10 years ago or so when companies were trying to get their pricing processes supported by systems. It turns out that a fair number of viable software alternatives out there today support the pricing process. We have felt for years that investing in this kind of software for most companies usually does make great sense.    Reibstein:  Which software systems are you thinking about?    Marn:  Some 30 or so are decent. But if I mention one, I risk endorsing it. There are several that are very good alternatives.  The point is that the payoff for doing even a little better in pricing, even a half a percentage point or a percentage point, is so high that it makes sense to have systems that let you deal with the issue at that level of precision. By the way, we’re not taking about rocket-science software. It’s simple software that makes very visible to salespeople and sales managers and market managers and product managers just what the real economics of a customer and a transaction are.    Reibstein:  Rather than mention any companies, can you talk about the class of software you’re referring to?    Marn:  There’s a class of software called administrative software that helps you figure out what the so-called price waterfall looks like for a customer or a transaction.  So when it’s time for you to make a decision when a customer is negotiating with you on next year’s contract, you can at the press of a button see where my discounts are but not the waterfall. What’s the bottom line, pocket price, and pocket margin? Was that realized for that account during the last year? What changed? Are they taking more cash discounts? Are they taking longer to pay? A system that adds it up together for you properly on a real-time basis can be hugely beneficial at times when you’re negotiating with customers.   [ Editor’s Note:  Many companies use an incomplete metric for transaction pricing, such as the list price or invoice price.  Pocket priceis simply invoice price minus all the off-invoice discounts that occur after invoice price, including items like cash discounts, volume bonuses, freight allowances, promotional allowances and cooperative advertising. Pocket price represents the real dollars and cents that are left in a business’ pocket as the result of a transaction.  A business does put list price or invoice price in its pocket, but it puts pocket price in its pocket to cover costs and ultimately contribute to margin and profitability.  The pocket price waterfall is simply the graphical representation of pocket price. The format is a set of vertical bars, the left-most one being list price and the following bars being the discounts subtracted from list price to get down to invoice price.  From the invoice price bar, all of the off-invoice items mentioned earlier are subtracted to get down to pocket price.  The picture ends up looking like a waterfall with dollars and cents "leaking away" with every bar down to pocket price.  When a product is custom-made to individual customers -- for example, not a standard packaged product for each consumer -- or if there exist important cost-to-serve items that vary widely by customer or transaction, then pocket price itself can be an inadequate representation of the attractiveness of a transaction.  In such situations, Marn and his co-authors often suggest the extension of pocket price down to pocket margin.  Hence, pocket margin is pocket price minus standard costs and minus any special costs-to-serve that a company might incur.  The pocket margin metrics allows the comparison of transactions where the product is not standard or the cost-to-serve is highly variable.  The pocket margin waterfall is the graphical representation of pocket margin.]   The second class is what I call optimizing software, which tries to provide some intelligence on how to price. This software looks up past transactions and tries to judge at what price level you’ll get an optimal price/benefit tradeoff for a certain category of products.   There’s a third category of price-testing software that I find very exciting. These products let companies that either sell online or sell through call centers on a real-time basis test price levels. If you are a computer company selling personal computers online, for every 20th PC that you sell in a certain class you might bump the price up 3% or bump it down 5% when you quote it. If you do this on a regular basis, if you have enough of a high-volume transaction stream, you can get a sense, with this real-time testing, how sensitivity to price is changing over time.    Reibstein:  I’m a big believer in that.    Marn:  That’s some of the most exciting software that’s come out in recent years, and I think companies are just beginning now to reap the benefit of that real-time understanding. The idea is that you always have a price test going on. You always have your thumb on the pulse of how price sensitivity is changing for products all the time.    Reibstein:  Mike, is there something I haven’t asked you yet that you’d like to mention?    Marn:  I’d like to say that all too many well-intentioned companies approach price improvement as a project, as something you can knock off in six months or a year and then go on to the next thing you need to fix. When you look at companies that have really created the price advantage, it’s not that way at all. This is at least a medium- to long-term journey. To get it right in most companies, you have to potentially touch hundreds, even thousands, of people. You have to change their day-to-day behavior, change the tools they use, change the way they think about price versus volume versus market share. It’s more work than you think. It’s a larger investment than you think. But the good news is that it’s worth it.   We’ve seen clients that have stuck with this over the years and they keep accumulating benefits over time, in terms of stretching out their margins on a year-over-year basis. But there’s almost a change in the feel of the culture of the company. If you go into a company that has created the price advantage, you see a couple of things. You see people who really are customer focused. They understand that they can’t create the price advantage unless they create value for their customers. And, you see workers at all levels who understand, ‘If I work hard to create an advantage for my customer or an advantage for my company, I know we’re going to get a payoff for it. My hard work at a company where the price advantage exists always has a payoff. It’s not going to be given away to the market. It’s not going to be frittered away in a temporary volume increase.’ There’s a certain spirit in companies that achieve the price advantage. It’s a long-term cultural change.

While other Washington-area jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on "big box" stores, legislation sponsored by Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan is aimed more narrowly at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The measure would impose tough new zoning restrictions on stores that are larger than 120,000 square feet and devote at least 10 percent of their floor space to groceries. It would exempt stores that do not sell food, such as most Target stores and Home Depot, and it would exempt club membership stores such as Costco.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., has one standard-size store in Montgomery County, in Germantown, and no plans to expand in the county, said Mia Masten, Wal-Mart's community affairs manager for the eastern region.  Still, Wal-Mart opposes the measure. "We think it's anti-competitive and anti-consumer," said Masten. "It not only affects us, but other competitors who want to come into Montgomery County and offer consumers one-stop shopping, which is what consumers say they want."  The alliance against Wal-Mart reflects the shared interests of supermarkets and Commercial Workers Local 400, which recently reached a four-year labor contract after weeks of preparations for a strike.  Across the country, the nonunion discount stores have been a serious competitive threat to established supermarkets and their unionized work forces.  During the contract talks between the chains and the union, supermarket executives noted increasing competition from Wal-Mart and other nonunion retailers as the impetus for proposed benefit cuts.  "We have spoken to coordinate lobbying the bill," said Barry F. Scher, Giant vice president of public affairs.  "We are supportive of the concept," said Safeway spokesman Greg TenEyck, although he said his chain has not taken an active role in lobbying for the measure.  A Local 400 official confirmed that the union is working with Giant to push the bill. "We are communicating about it," the official said.  The pre-emptive move in Montgomery County did not surprise industry experts.  "A grocery store cannot compete against a supercenter," said Jason Whitmer, an analyst at FTN Midwest Research Securities. "The logic is to fight Wal-Mart before they come, rather than when they come."  FTN Midwest found that within a year of opening, a Wal-Mart supercenter takes 11 percent of grocery store business within three miles.  It's not clear whether the proposed ordinance will win approval from the Montgomery County Council. Uncertainty remains about whether singling out combination retail stores - those that sell food and general merchandise - would survive a court challenge.  "I don't think we've been provided with enough information to draw a circle around something called a combination retail store and have it pass legal muster," said council President Steven A. Silverman.

Its stock is still paying the price for that widely publicized miscalculation. Now, the Anglo-Dutch outfit that manufactures Slim-Fast diet products has got the low-carb religion, replacing the head of that division and preparing to roll out a slew of low-carb products.   Meantime, while Unilever's performance continues to lag, peers like France's Danone and Switzerland's Nestlé have seen revenues and stocks rise nicely this year. Unilever squeezed only a 1.3% revenue gain from its leading brands - a key sales measurement - in the first quarter of 2004 amid a variety of challenges, including increasing competition.   Analysts had forecast at least a 2% boost, and the figure was a far cry from Unilever's 3% to 5% long-term growth target for leading brands such as Knorr soups and Surf detergent. Its stable of leading brands, which make up nearly 95% of sales, rose 2.5% in 2003.    Star-studded cupboard.  When the latest results were announced on Apr. 28, Unilever's American depositary receipts (ADRs), which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped more than 7%. (Each Unilever ADR represents one share of Rotterdam-based parent Unilever NV. Although Unilever operates as a single company, a separate London-based parent company, Unilever PLC, trades on the London stock exchange.)   Since then, the shares have recovered some. Trading around $66 as of June 14, the stock is up about 3% so far this year, vs. a 2% gain for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, of which Unilever ADRs are not a component.   Unilever shares have been resilient because many of its brands, including Vaseline and Ben & Jerry's, to tick off a few more, are recognized around the world. Unilever is also highly profitable, boasting some of the fattest margins vs. its European rivals. First-quarter operating margins were a rich 14.9% before exceptional items and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets (BEIA).    Faltering strategy?  In fiscal 2004, Unilever is expected to have 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in net income (BEIA), 3% higher than in 2003, on revenue of 42.3 billion euros ($51.2 billion), according to Michael Steib, executive director with Morgan Stanley in London. Steib's revenue forecast is about 1.4% lower than last year's number, mainly because of currency translations.   "They have strong brands, and they have strong value," Steib says. "Bottom-line growth and margin improvement have been impressive." Still, Steib remains neutral on Unilver, rating it equal weight. And his 58 euro price target for shares trading on the Amsterdam exchange suggests only 5% or so price appreciation in the next 12 months. "They need to demonstrate through innovation and change in brands that they intend to have a pickup in top-line growth."   Unilever management has its work cut out, analysts and company watchers say. "Growth strategy appears to have sort of faltered," says Lex Werkheim, a partner at Eureffect, an Amsterdam asset-management firm which owns Unilever shares.    Slim-fast’s slow switch.  Unilever says it's nearing the end of a five-year "Path to Growth" launched in 1999. It's on track to trim brands to the most profitable 400 from a once dizzying 1,600 worldwide, it says. It also has cut more than the expected 3.9 billion euros ($4.7 billion) from manufacturing and other operations as part of the growth initiative.   And Unilever PLC has had a change at the top. Chairman Niall FitzGerald, 58, is leaving to become chairman of British news and information company Reuters. In keeping with tradition, Unilever PLC has picked an insider to fill the spot. Patrick Cescau, a 55-year-old director of the firm's global foods division, takes the helm later this year.   But analysts want to see more progress before becoming more upbeat about the stock. First, Unilever needs to do a better job of managing its brands, analysts say, especially Slim-Fast. "In early June of last year, Unilever was still saying low-carb diets were a fad that was going to go away," says London-based J.P. Morgan analysts Arnaud Langlois, who has an underweight rating on the stock and believes the price could actually decline. Slim-Fast products traditionally have included foods such as shakes and meal bars that serve as low-calorie - but not necessarily low-carbohydrate - alternatives to regular food.    On the scent.  Someone finally got the message. At the end of last year, Unilever rolled out five low-carb Slim-Fast products. And in its Apr. 28 earnings release, the big news was that the low-carb newcomers are already accounting for about 20% of Slim-Fast revenues.   But it also said in the same note that Slim-Fast's low-carb debut "has not yet compensated for the decline in share of the traditional products." Seventeen more low-carb products are going to be launched, the company said. And on June 4, Unilever said the president of the Slim-Fast unit would be leaving, to be replaced by a food-division exec.   Slim-Fast isn't Unilever's only struggling brand. There's also the Prestige fragrance division, which sells Calvin Klein Obsession, Eternity, cK, and other designer names. "Other companies have been quicker to launch more products," Steib says. "With fragrances, consumers are on to new things very quickly." Those twin problems with Slim-Fast and fragrances have hit Unilever particularly hard in North America, which represented 23% of revenues in 2003, and where first-quarter sales fell 4%.   In an e-mail response to BusinessWeek Online, company spokesman Trevor Gorin said consumers have not had any "significant change in taste" when it comes to Unilever fragrances. Rather, marketing the scents became tougher, as consumers became more selective in their discretionary spending. The division, Gorin says, is under new leadership and expects to see the benefits from a restructuring plan in the second half of 2004. As for Slim-Fast, Gorin says Unilever forecasts "a return to modest growth as we rebuild consumer loyalty" in 2004.    New focus.  Unilever also has more work to do in getting rid of underperforming brands, analysts say. As the prime target, most investing pros singled out the frozen-food business in Europe. Increased competition from discounters and others is making pricing tough there, analysts say.   Unilever has already identified 10% to 15% more frozen-food products as noncore, according to Gorin. "Actions are being taken to rationalize the portfolio and focus on higher growth segments," he says.   The company has also been criticized for not returning more of its cash on hand to shareholders, says Julian Lakin, an analyst with brokerage firm Pereire Tod in London, who rates Unilever accumulate. Cash flow in the first quarter grew 18%, to an impressive 970 million euros ($1.2 billion). Proceeding with special dividends to shareholders or stock buybacks are two methods of increasing investor interest, Lakin says.    Check-out line.  For now, Gorin says Unilever is focused on trimming debt to 10 billion euro ($12.1 billion) from the current 12.5 billion euros ($15.1 billion). After that, he says surplus cash generation "will be used to enhance shareholder return."   Since Unilever's founding in 1930, it has posted average annual earnings per share growth of 8%, Gorin adds. Over the same period, that bests the Dow Jones index of industrial companies by 20%, he says. And few doubt that Unilever is a formidable company. Even Langlois, who is negative on the stock, says "management needs to be given more time" to improve the situation.  It's also true that Unilever faces multiple challenges, including growing competition in its traditionally high-margin and high-profit emerging markets. Still, investors hoping to see quick returns may want to consider giving Unilever more time before putting its shares in their shopping carts.

But with this week's almost simultaneous launch of Coca-Cola C2 and Pepsi Edge, both containing 50 percent less calories, carbohydrates, and sugar than regular sodas, the two soft-drink manufacturers will once again heat up their decades-old rivalry.  The difference is that the stakes are much higher and the competitive landscape much different since the debuts of Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi during the 1980s. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been desperately searching for ways to jump-start stagnant soft-drink sales as consumers buy more energy drinks and bottled water.  As obesity becomes a more serious health concern in the United States, critics are lumping Coca-Cola and Pepsi with the likes of Big Macs and Oreo cookies. Foodmakers ranging from General Mills Inc. to Kraft are scrambling to jump aboard the low-carb bandwagon before the phenomenon runs out of steam.  Whether C2 or Edge succeeds or simply fizzles out is anybody's guess, analysts say. For years, the companies have tried unsuccessfully to bridge the gap between diet and regular sodas (remember Pepsi One?). Soft-drink manufacturers also are not known for their innovation skills (remember New Coke?). But Gary Hemphill, senior vice president of Beverage Marketing Corp., a consulting firm in New York, credits Coca-Cola and Pepsi for trying to shake things up. Until now, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been content to develop flavor extensions such as Vanilla Coke or Mountain Dew Code Red, a less risky strategy that generates more sales "but does not create heightened demand for carbonated soft drinks." C2 and Edge "are significant departures from the flavor innovations that the industry has pursued the past several years," Hemphill said. "It makes a lot of sense to focus on more functional [health] needs," Hemphill said. "There's greater potential here for longer term growth." The industry could use a boost. Carbonated soft drinks sales increased only 0.4 percent last year, according to Beverage Marketing Corp. figures. Per-capita consumption dipped to 53.8 gallons from 54.2 gallons in 2002, the fifth consecutive year of such a decline. Flagship brands Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi both lost market share. Only diet sodas showed strong growth. To fight what industry observers call "cola fatigue," both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are heavily hyping C2 and Edge. Coca-Cola spent an estimated $30 million to $50 million to promote C2, its biggest product launch since Diet Coke in 1982. In addition to television and Internet ads, Coca-Cola gave a million cases of C2 to employees, a new initiative called "Ambassador Sampling." With consumers interested in health and wellness products, C2 hits retailers at the right moment, said Jeffrey Laschen, vice president and general manager of Midwest Coca-Cola Bottling Co. in Eagan, whose territory includes the Twin Cities. "Timing is everything and the timing is right now," Laschen said. C2 "is a great platform to bring back people who left carbonated soft drinks for one reason or another. ... There are a whole segment of consumers looking for a diet beverage but don't like the taste." Laschen thinks C2 could create a new category of soft drinks, similar to the way Anheuser-Busch positioned Michelob Ultra as a premium low-carb beer. C2 could play particularly well in the Twin Cities, Coca-Cola's largest market for diet sodas, he said. The question is whether C2 will attract new customers or siphon existing sales from Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Classic. "Although C2 will cannibalize Coke and Diet Coke, the company is reasonable ... in expecting the brand to draw from noncarbs, as noncarbs, including water, have benefited from consumers' search for lower-calorie alternatives to regular soft drinks," Mark Swartzberg, an analyst with Legg Mason, wrote in a recent research note. For Pepsi, Edge represents its latest attempt to fill the gap between diet and regular soda drinkers. The company estimates 60 million Americans are dual users -- they drink both regular and diet sodas. In 1998, Pepsi rolled out Pepsi One, which contains only one calorie, but it never caught on. "Maybe it was ahead of its time," said David DeCecco, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola North America. Pepsi One "never found the scale nor the following we would have liked it to have." With 20 grams of sugar, 20 grams of carbs, and 70 calories, Edge will appeal to consumers who want to make only gradual changes to their diets and lifestyles, DeCecco said.  "This isn't about just one product," he said, "but a fundamental change in how people drink soft drinks. ... People are paying more attention to what they eat and drink. We hope Edge helps people rediscover the soft drink aisle." Not everyone is convinced. Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark, a consulting firm in Santa Barbara, Calif., said Coca-Cola and Pepsi are looking for a market that doesn't exist. "To be honest, they are really wasting their time," Pirko said. "Consumers want either a full-flavor soda or they want to lose weight. C2 and Edge don't solve obesity issues at all. This piddling, little bit of this, little bit of that approach only confuses consumers. Pepsi One was a much more full-flavored soda, but it didn't work." And by releasing C2 and Edge at the same time, Coca-Cola and Pepsi will only cancel each other out, he said. Harry Balzer, vice president and food analyst with NPD Group Inc., thinks the market is large enough for C2 and Edge to make their case. The brands will get consumers' attention because soft drinks are "a high-interest category," he said. "I'm sure people will try them," Balzer said. "But will they have staying power?"

       HIGHLIGHTS    SUPERMARKET – U.S.A. MARKET   Consumer Outlook Improving, But Supermarkets Will Lose Share   The economic outlook is improving, but conventional supermarkets will be challenged to reap the benefits, according to economists at Retail Forward here.  In a conference call yesterday, the group noted that conventional supermarkets need to develop concepts focusing on upmarket customers because competition from supercenters will continue to gain share of the lower end. “Most of the growth of supermarkets over the past five years was simply a result of climbing food prices,” said Steve Spiwak, an economist with Retail Forward. “Although food inflation this year is benefitting growth, easing inflation thereafter should [put] further pressure on growth in this channel.” The group expects the economy overall to improve: Mortgage rates despite recent rises will remain affordable, and demand for home goods and food will remain steady. “The good news is the general outlook for retailing is very good. The U.S. economy is again going to be among the strongest economies in the world,”   Source;  RF, June 04 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  TECHNOLOGY – MARKET STRATEGIES   BMW and Apple announce iPod auto promotion    Tightly Integrates Music Unit Into Car Audio System  Following Volkswagen's successful co-promotion of an iPod/vehicle package last year, BMW of North American and Apple Computer yesterday announced a BMW/iPod deal. The automaker will offer an integrated iPod adapter for select 2002 through 2004 models beginning July 12.    Different from VW  Stan Ng, director of product marketing at Apple, said last year's iPod deal with Volkswagen of America differed because it was merely a summer promotion offering Beetle hard-top buyers an iPod and adapter. Jim McDowell, vice president of marketing at BMW, in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said BMW's iPod adapter will be directly hooked into the vehicle's audio system, allowing owners to use the car's controls for the iPod. The personal music device is plugged into a cable connection in the glove box and stored out of the way there. Control features allow the driver to change tracks, playlists or volume from touch buttons installed in the steering wheel. The iPod adapter for BMWs will cost $149, plus installation costs done at dealerships.    'Lot of car companies'  Mr. Ng pointed out that BMW won't have exclusivity for vehicle-integrated adapters. "I think a lot of car companies are looking at this," he said.  Along with a new Web site, iPodYourBMW.com, BMW will use cable TV and national newspapers and magazine advertising to promote the offer. That campaign launches today, the company said. Publicis Groupe's Fallon, Minneapolis, created the theme - "Control freaks, rejoice" - for the campaign, which also includes outdoor ads in five cities and spot radio. Parts of the media buy continues into August. Spending wasn't disclosed.    Mini Coopers included  BMW will offer the iPod adapters on its 3 Series, Z4 roadster, X3 and X5 sport utility vehicles. Mr. McDowell said the marketer hopes to add more of its models, but started with its highest-volume lines. The adapters will be available in late summer for all BMW-owned Mini Cooper models. Apple has sold more than 3 million iPods since introducing the product in fall 2001. Depending on the model, the suggested retail prices range from $249 to $499.

The suit alleges that the retailing giant has systematically paid women unfairly and passed them over for promotions. In a prepared statement, Wal-Mart said it would appeal. "Let's keep in mind that today's ruling has absolutely nothing to do with the merits of the case," said Mona Williams, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, in a prepared statement. "[The judge] is simply saying he thinks it meets the legal requirements necessary to move forward as a class action. We strongly disagree with his decision and will seek an appeal." No trial date has been set.

Sony, now neck and neck with Matsushita Electric Industrial for the mantle of the world's biggest consumer electronics maker, is hoping for brisk sales of its Cybershot digital cameras, Vaio personal computers and camcorders in China.   "China is increasing its strength in the manufacturing world," Sony President Kunitake Ando told a news conference on Wednesday. "As a market, it has very huge potential."  But rivalry in China's $9.8 billion consumer electronics market is heating up, with South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co and domestic players such as Sichuan Changhong slugging it out for consumers' cash.   China accounted for about two percent of global revenue in the last business year, but it is the company's fastest-growing market and already generates more sales for Sony than any other country except the United States and Japan.  Price-based competition from domestic manufacturers, however, will weigh on margins. Rampant software piracy is expected to hinder efforts to market its blockbuster PlayStation 2 console, a key driver of global operating profit.  It has also been criticised recently as slow to market with innovative products such as flat-panel televisions.    Bigger than Japan  Sony posted a 70 percent leap in sales in China to $1.7 billion in the year ended in March 2004, slightly exceeding its own previous forecasts and putting it on track to achieve sales of $8 billion annually by 2008, the company said.  It had forecast China sales of $1.6 billion for the latest business year.  "Mathematically, China, this market, is a few times bigger than Japan," Sony Chief Executive Nobuyuki Idei said, after opening a three-storey showroom in downtown Shanghai displaying the robot dog Aibo and other gadgets.  "We are confident of achieving our goals," Idei said.  Sony's shares closed down 0.7 percent at 4,020 yen on Wednesday, underperforming a flat Tokyo market.   The Japanese company invested some $900 million in China over the past decade.  Its latest investments include plants in Southern China to make components and an expansion of production facilities in Wuxi city, in the country's east.  Sony is joining a wave of Japanese manufacturers building plants in China to capitalise on lower costs, while enhancing its research and development capability and boosting the number of staff.   The consumer electronics giant, which also vies with Japan's Sharp Corp, posted a 23 percent fall in annual net profit in the last financial year due to restructuring charges.   But it forecast better earnings for this year.   Part of that would be driven by China, whose increasingly wealthy consumers have developed a taste for new-fangled digital toys, executives said.  "China will be the main growth driver for Sony," said Kei Kodera, chairman of Sony China.

Wal-Mart launched its initial implementation on April 30 in the north Texas area. Cases and pallets of 21 products from eight suppliers were shipped to Wal-Mart's Sanger, Texas, distribution center, then onward to seven local supercenters with RFID tags. "Over the next 16 months, we also plan to significantly increase the number of Wal-Mart stores and Sam's Clubs where customers can benefit from this revolutionary technology," said Linda Dillman, executive vice president and CEO, Wal-Mart, in a statement. Wal-Mart's top 100 suppliers, plus 37 additional suppliers, are already working on meeting a January 2005 deadline to be live in north Texas in three DCs and about 100 stores. Following that, the retailer said it planned to be live in up to six DCs and up to 250 Wal-Mart stores and Sam's Clubs by June 2005, and up to 13 DCs and 600 Wal-Mart stores and Sam's Clubs by October 2005. Also, the next top 200 suppliers will begin tagging cases and pallets by January 2006, Wal-Mart said in its statement.   Source;  LuisB. Corporate official sources.

The retailers and WWRE held a meeting here June 17 for 16 of their key suppliers to collaborate on plans to advance global data sync. “Delhaize has selected the WWRE’s Worldwide Item Management solution as our global data pool.

Look for some new ad campaigns in different media at Coca-Cola Co. now that the world's largest soft drink company has named Chuck Fruit chief marketing officer, succeeding Daniel Palumbo, who has left the company to pursue other interests.    Fruit joined Coca-Cola in 1991 as head of Global Media Services and has held a variety of positions, most recently as s.v.p. of Integrated Marketing, with the responsibility for developing the company's worldwide media and sponsorship strategies, and its investments in all forms of traditional and emerging media platforms. He was also acting c.m.o. in 2003.   "Marketing is clearly evolving, and the emergence of new media and many competitive opportunities for consumer stimuli mean that we need to find new, innovative ways of addressing our consumers and ensuring the relevance of our brands," Neville Isdell, Coca-Cola chairman, said in a memo sent Tuesday to Coca-Cola employees. "In the last 50 years, the 30-second television spot has defined our brands, and while it is still important, I think its impact has diminished."  "Today's consumer and media environments call for a more multifaceted and integrated approach to marketing, from our consumer communications to the point of sale and all the way through to opening a bottle of Coca-Cola," Isdell continued. "Creativity is vital, and so is a broader, holistic view of how to reach our consumers."  Palumbo had only been with Coca-Cola for one year, joining the company last June from Eastman Kodak, where he held several positions, notably s.v.p. of the Consumer Imaging division, which accounts for half of that company's sales. During his career he also held positions with Procter & Gamble.

The award for "best flowchart" can only be so far away.   Yesterday in Cannes, France, the packaged-goods behemoth announced its sponsorship of the newly created Gunn Report for Media.  The Gunn Report, started by Donald Gunn in 1999, is an annual collection of worldwide creative advertising awards. The initial Gunn Report for Media, to be published in October of this year, will be a similar showcase for industry awards honoring media planning and buying. Details on which media awards will be included and how often the Gunn Report for Media will be issued were unavailable.  According to a press release issued by P&G: "The goal of this publication is to put a global spotlight on media innovation and success, and ultimately, inspire a higher quality media around the world."  "Everyday, consumers are bombarded by marketers who are vying for their attention," said Bernhard Glock, P&G's manager of global media, at a press conference yesterday. "As an industry, we need to better understand how to reach our consumers when and where they are most receptive. In order to do this, we have to elevate the importance and quality of our media efforts globally."  The sponsorship by P&G would appear to be in line with an ongoing push by the company to shake up the way its advertising agencies approach media planning. Back in February, P&G Global Marketing Officer Jim Stengel gave a speech at an American Association of Advertising Agencies conference entitled "The Future of Marketing," during which he encouraged marketers to move beyond focusing solely on 30-second TV spots.  Then, in April, P&G also commissioned a complete "communications review," seeking to "redesign its media planning agencies into communication planning agencies."  "By sponsoring the Gunn Report for Media, P&G recognizes that media is as vital to our success as the outstanding creative product we demand from our agencies," Glock said. "We value innovation in media, as well as breakthrough thinking and creativity from our marketing partners."

H&M said that it had lowered its prices by 5 per cent across the three months to May 31, a move which has paid off by lifting sales volumes by around 14 per cent. The retailer reported an 8 per cent increase in turnover across the six months to the end of May, up to SEK SEK13.2 bn. At comparable currency rates, the increase was 10 per cent.  H&M said sales in its first two stores in Canada, have been well ahead of expectations, and announced plans for further expansion in North America, with a store in San Francisco planned to open next year.

As expected, Europe's leading specialist electrical retailer has announced plans to return £200m to shareholders through a share buyback programme, using the proceeds of the sale of its stake in ISP Wanadoo and European property business Codic.  In the year to May 1, Dixons turnover increased by 13 per cent to £6.5bn, with group like-for-like sales up 3 per cent. UK like-for-likes grew by 2 per cent, with international like-for-likes up 4 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose by 11 per cent to £331.6m, towards the top end of City forecasts.  Overall, the UK Retail division made an operating profit of £254.2m. There was strong growth in new technology products including plasma & LCD TVs, DVD players and digital photography, while sales of games consoles dipped in the absence of new hardware launches, while VCRs and 35mm photography sales fell as consumers moved to new technology. The overall computing market grew by 2 per cent, with PC hardware sales down by 2 per cent as strong unit volume growth was offset by price deflation.   In April, the group announced plans to close 106 under-performing smaller Dixons stores, mainly in town centre locations. Dixons said the costs associated with the closures are now expected to be £44m. Across the year, the Dixons chain saw total sales fall by 6 per cent to £798m, with like-for-like sales down 5 per cent. A new Dixons management team is focused on improving performance in the core chain. This plan includes revamping store space around growth categories, as well as more effective advertising and aggressive price promotions.  Signalling a move to larger formats, the group said trials of the new Dixons XL format continued, with four new stores opened and two further XL planned for this financial year.  There were stronger performances in the groups other UK chains. Currys sales of £1,752m were up 4 per cent. Like for like sales grew by 4 per cent for the full year, but were up 8 per cent in the second half. Currys continued to relocate to larger out-of-town sites, opening or resiting 14 new stores across the year, taking the total number of stores to 379, with 13 more new stores to open or resite during this financial year. PC World sales grew by 6 per cent to £1,327m, despite significant price deflation in PC hardware. There was strong growth in sales of laptops, accessories and wireless networks. Twelve new PC World stores opened during the year, taking the total to 138, with similar numbers expected to open or resite in the current year.   Sales at mobile phone retailer The Link grew by 10 per cent to £407m, with like-for-like sales also 10 per cent up. A new concept store format was developed, giving greater prominence to contract connections and more effective display of handsets. The format will be rolled out across the 28 store group this year.   Sales in the International retail division were £1,760, up 47 per cent in total and 4 per cent on like-for-like. Dixons international businesses now accounts for 27 per cent of group sales.  Group chief executive John Clare, said: "The group made good progress during the year. Sales and profits were up and we recorded a strong performance in our four largest chains - Currys, PC World, Elkjop and UniEuro.  "Our investment businesses are progressing well and we agreed the roll-out of PC City in Spain. In the second half, we implemented the first steps of our improvement plan for the Dixons chain."  The group said performance for the first seven weeks of the current financial year has been in line with expectations, with LCD and plasma TVs selling well across Europe ahead of the Euro 2004 tournament   Dixons said it is cautious about growth prospects in the UK, given rising interest rates and the potential for a slowdown in the housing market. However, international outlook is generally more favourable, and all the Group's operations are expected to benefit from demand for new technology products, and Dixons "remains very confident about its abilities to perform well against its competitors".   Clare said: "It is too early to extrapolate this trend for the year as a whole, but I believe the group is well placed for a year of further progress." Source; General media and corporate sources.

       HIGHLIGHTS    RETAIL – M&A   Sears to Buy Up to 54 Kmart Stores   Kmart Holding Corp. agreed to sell up to 54 stores to Sears, Roebuck and Co. for $621 million, the companies said on Wednesday, a deal that gives Kmart much-needed cash and Sears more room to expand.   The move comes less than a month after Kmart agreed to sell as many as 24 stores to Home Depot Inc. The discount retailer has been building up its cash position since getting out of bankruptcy in May 2003.  Kmart, which closed some 600 of its 2,100 stores while under bankruptcy court protection, said it would continue to operate these 54 stores until March or April 2005.  For Sears, the largest U.S. department store chain, buying the stores will help it get back into expansion mode after about two decades of stagnant growth. The company has been looking for ways to roll out its new Sears Grand prototype stores faster.  The stores, which Sears is opening away from the shopping malls that most of its 870 stores anchor, combine the retailer's usual assortment of appliances, tools and clothing with a small selection of food, books and magazines, and health and beauty aids.  Chairman Edward Lampert, by far Kmart's biggest shareholder, said at the company's annual meeting in May that Kmart is not actively looking to sell its stores, but would consider an offer if it involved more money than the company thought it could make running the stores.  In a statement on Wednesday, Kmart Chief Executive Julian Day said the retailer was "not currently in discussions regarding any additional significant store sales, although we will continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise."  Kmart in January 2002 became the largest U.S. retailer to file for bankruptcy, after a poor holiday shopping season compounded financial woes. It emerged from Chapter 11 in May 2003 with new investors, far less debt and a management team led by financier Lampert.  Lampert is also a big Sears shareholder. His investment companies owned 13.5 percent of Sears' stock, according to the retailer's proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March.

Three of the acquired Kmart stores will open under the Sears Grand banner, while the remaining locations will trade under the Sears name, but feature a product mix similar to Grand. The Sears Grand concept, which debuted in two locations last year, includes convenience food items in addition to apparel and home merchandise. The stores generate more frequent visits from a tighter trade area than mall-based stores, said Alan Lacy, Sears' chief executive officer, in a conference call yesterday. Sears did not disclose specific locations of stores to be purchased, but said about 60% of them are located in the top 15 population markets.

"Be among the first to test drive our screensaver," the headline on the Wegmans Web site reads.   "You're invited to be among the first Wegmans customers to 'test drive' our very first screensaver," the copy reads. "Actually, it's more like an electronic cookbook that's continually updated with mouthwatering images that link directly to our latest seasonal, chef-developed recipes. The graphics are outstanding, and there's even a cool feature that lets you 'turn' the pages from one recipe to another and back again.

In the rail freight sector the main development occurred in 2003 when legislation on market liberalisation entered into force. In theory the directive opened up the trans-European rail freight network to international goods services, with the entire network following in 2008. A second railways package proposed by the Commission in 2002 aimed to open up the national freight markets by 2006 and cabotage (the domestic movement of goods by operators from third party countries) by 2008.  However by 2003, the first package had not yet been fully 'transposed' in seven Member States. Countries, which have been slow in implementing the requisite legislation, are: Austria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Sweden and UK. In addition to legislative delays the Commission has found a whole range of other barriers to free market competition being employed by countries seeking to protect its present incumbent. For instance in Germany the report found that the process to allocate capacities remained problematic, as its independence was not guaranteed. In other countries where a proper institutional framework does not exist, a range of informal barriers prevents access to new market entrants. The result has been that in many cases the state owned incumbent still dominates the markets with shares in excess of 90%. However where proper procedures are in place to facilitate private sector competition new market entrants have been forthcoming. This is particularly the case in the Netherlands.

Mountain View, California-based Google, which is preparing a much-anticipated initial public offering, said Affinity's claims are without merit.  In its lawsuit filed on May 25 in Santa Clara County Superior Court, and first reported by Wired News, Palo Alto, California-based Affinity Engines charged that company co-founder Orkut Buyukkokten took software code he wrote on Affinity's behalf and used it to build Orkut.  Affinity further charged that Buyukkokten had promised he would not build a rival social-networking service at Google.  Representatives from Affinity Engines, which is seeking damages and royalties, could not be immediately reached for comment.  Google said Affinity Engines had not provided any evidence to Google that their source code was used in the development of Orkut.com.  "We have repeatedly offered to allow a neutral expert to compare the code in the two programs and evaluate Affinity's claims, but Affinity has rejected that offer," the company said in a statement.  Google added that it has thoroughly investigated the claims and concluded that Affinity Engines' allegations are without merit.  Google rolled out Orkut, which is still in testing, in January. Other social networking companies include Friendster, Tribe and Zero Degrees, which was bought by Barry Diller's InterActiveCorp Web conglomerate in March.  The services connect friends of friends for dates and activities and have attracted millions in venture capital funding.

The Danish Competition Advisory Board has passed Statoil's takeover of the Haahr petrol station chain after the deadline for objections expired. Despite it making Statoil the second largest retail gasoline brand in Denmark, the merger has gone through unopposed, primarily because the deal will not significantly boost the company's market share.   According to preliminary figures from Datamonitor's forthcoming Forecourt Retailing Database, the acquisition of the 30 Haahr sites would make Statoil the fourth ranked player in the Danish fuel sector on fuel volumes, with a 14.9% slice of the market. Statoil has yet to state its intentions for the 30 sites, 50% of which are unmanned.  Irrespective of how Statoil develops the newly acquired sites, it poses little direct competition to other main players, making the lack of objections understandable. DK Benzin, under the DK and OK retail brands, has a 26% share of volumes. It operates 202 manned and 586 unmanned sites, making it clear market leader. DK Benzin should only be concerned if Statoil attempts to acquire another small player. However, the opportunity for this is limited. Jet is the only smaller player in the market with a significant number of sites that is yet to merge with another company. Owner ConocoPhillips is unlikely to surrender its 60 unmanned operations in this important part of the Scandinavian region, especially in light of the company's 2% increase in market share over 2002-03.  The sole company with reasonable grounds for complaint over the Statoil purchase would be Q8. Given that Q8 enjoys a 14.6% share of fuel volumes, the takeover nudges Statoil slightly ahead of it in terms of market share. Nevertheless, despite the change in Q8's ranking position to fifth place, the merger will have little effect on its absolute position.  The reality is that Statoil's takeover of Haahr has simply enabled it to maintain its share of fuel volumes. In 2002 it accounted for 14.7% of volumes, and it now has 14.9%. In the absence of the Haahr merger this figure would have fallen to 13.8%. The takeover has simply been a sensible move by Statoil to make up some lost ground and consolidate its position. It is unlikely to alter significantly the competitive landscape of the Danish fuel retail market.

The Fed’s meeting ends this afternoon and an announcement on the anticipated quarter-point rate hike will come about 2:15 p.m. EDT. It’s the announcement’s language that the market is going to dissect. The interest rate hike is already priced in.  If the language remains substantially the same, that will augur for a relief rally in the Treasury and foreign exchange markets. On the other hand, if the words conveying “measured” or “patience” are not in evidence, expect what one of my colleagues calls a brown trousers kind of day.   U.S. stocks are seen little changed at the open. Freddie Mac reported a 52 percent drop in net profit for 2003 due in part to last year’s restatement. Sears is buying more than 50 stores from Kmart for $621 million.   General Mills just reported its earnings and is warning that next year may not be so sweet. It also announced the winner of the 41st Pillsbury Bake-Off this morning. An ex-librarian from Ohio won the $1 million prize.    Note ; U.S. central bank policy-makers were set to pull the plug on June 30, 2004 on the cheapest credit in decades by raising official interest rates for the first time in four years. Analysts universally expect the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to move the federal funds rate a quarter percentage point upward from its current 1 percent, which is its lowest level since 1958.     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The opening is part of the company's ambition to expand existing markets over the next three years. "We have very aggressive growth plans," Wild Oats spokeswoman Sonja Tuitele told Progressive Grocer. "This year we are opening about 12 stores; next year we will open 20 stores; and in 2006 and beyond we will be opening about 40 stores a year."  In the near future Wild Oats plans to do the bulk of its expansion in existing markets, to provide customers with greater convenience as well as to leverage distribution and the supply chain, and gain economies of scale in advertising. "For example, with only one store in Cincinnati, we are already distributing to that store, our regional folks were already having to travel out there to the store, and we were already advertising to that market," says Tuitele. "If we have three or four stores in the area, we are able to leverage that spend across all of them."  The Cincinnati store will be 28,000 square feet, which will be the size of most of their new prototype stores, said Tuitele, as it offers customers what they're looking for in terms of natural and organic products, in a friendly, community-market-style store.  One new feature will be a Holistic Health Center, a store-within-a-store format where vitamins, supplements, and body care products are to be sold. The concept was first tested in Wild Oats' flagship store in May and, counting the new location, will be in three stores.  "In our older stores these products were in the center of the store, because our founders came out of that industry," said Tuitele. "Through our research we found that it was a bit intimidating for our customers. In the new concept the shelving is lower, so it fosters better customer service; it is more inviting, kind of like a little boutique which offers the natural personal care items, and body care and vitamins and supplements. There are interactive screens where you can look up information; all the employees have been trained fairly extensively on product knowledge, so they are really armed to serve our customers better."  For future stores Wild Oats plans to seek out areas where the demographics consist of college-educated consumers; following this, level of income is the next big factor in choosing its locations, though, as Tuitele pointed out, this is becoming increasingly less important.   "Typically what follows education is income, and those are people who can afford to shop natural and organic foods," she said. "But here the price differential is coming down when you shop in-season or when you shop the bulk department; you are finding prices that are very competitive to what you find in a conventional store. Plus our high-touch customer service and high level of employee training help to keep customers coming back. It is an experience they don't find elsewhere.  "It definitely helps us differentiate ourselves from other stores," Tuitele added. "Especially if the conventional stores are worried about Wal-Mart and worried about lowering their prices, it gives us a positioning in the marketplace that is very unique."

"Although we have had no reported incidents of salmonella poisoning from these products, the company is just being overly cautious," FDA spokeswoman Kay Carpenter told Progressive Grocer.  The Fruit & Nut Trail Mix Granola Bars are packaged in 7.4-ounce boxes with expiration dates between June 6, 2004 (JUN0604) and Dec. 31, 2004 (DEC3104). The Muesli Cereals are packaged in a 15.3-ounce box with the expiration dates between Sept. 10, 2004 (SEP1004) and Dec. 10, 2004 (DEC1004).  The Fruit & Nut Trail Mix Granola Bars were distributed nationwide to retail chains and are sold under their brand names: Acme, Albertsons, BiLo, Food Club, Food Lion, Fred Meyer, Giant, Giant Eagle, Great Value, Hill Country Fare, Hy-vee, Jewel, Kroger, Laura Lynn, Meijer, Millville, Our Family, Price Chopper, Ralph's, Roundy's, Stater Brothers, Stop & Shop, Sunny Select, Tops and Weis. The Muesli Cereals were distributed nationwide to retail chains and are sold under their brand names: Acme, Albertsons, Archer Farm, Best Choice, Central Market, Flavorite, Fred Meyer, Harris Teeter, Hy-vee, Jewel, Kroger, Ralph's, Safeway, Select Healthy Advantage, Shaw's, and Shop & Save.  "All of these stores have been notified by phone, letter, and e-mail, with plenty of follow-ups, to make sure that the message doesn't slip by," Carpenter noted.  Almonds received by Grist Mill were randomly tested for the presence of salmonella. This ingredient testing did not reveal a presence of salmonella in raw almonds before the ingredient was used to manufacture the subject products, and there are no reported illnesses associated with these products. However, the company is working with the FDA to assure the quality and safety of the food supply.  This recall is in response to a voluntary recall by Paramount Farms of California of whole and diced raw almonds, based on over 20 possible illnesses associated with the almonds nationwide.

The company announced last week it had signed a multi-million dollar agreement with radio personality Tom Joyner and his company, Reach Media.  The deal is important for a number of reasons, not the least being it represents a fundamental shift in how P&G communicates with consumers in the African-American community. The consumer brands giant is taking its message to the audience through radio, the medium that helped put it and its iconic brands on the map. P&G will air commercials on the "Tom Joyner Morning Show," which is syndicated in 115 markets across the U.S. Mr. Joyner's show has an estimated audience of eight million listeners. P&G's deal, however, is a lot more than just running spots on the radio.  The company's brands will also sponsor features like "Thursday Morning Mom," a salute to moms, and "It's Your World," a daily soap opera.  Mr. Joyner and his on-air crew will interact with P&G products on the air, what the company calls "endorsement radio."  P&G will also support organizations, including the Tom Joyner Foundation, which assist students at historically black colleges.

Will it pay off?  First, it should be noted that Procter and Gamble is no neophyte to the African-American market. They have two agencies with an African-American specialization, Williams Advertising and Burrell, and P&G has also been a big sponsor of organizations like the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, the United Negro College Fund, the BET College Tour and others. To answer our own question, P&G is apparently asking itself if more targeted, grassroots marketing is the key to success in modern brand management.  According to an article in the New York Times, Procter will be conducting a study to measure the value of this new partnership. Said P&G's Susan Mboya, "Because it's becoming more and more difficult to reach consumers," we must "understand better the return we're getting on every marketing investment."    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  RETAIL EUROPE – TECHNOLOGY   Polish Retailer Deploys New Technology to Support European Expansion         LPP S.A. is a rapidly growing fashion retailer based in Poland. From its headquarters in Gdansk, the company designs clothing that it distributes throughout Europe. Production process takes place in the Far East by the same manufacturers that work for other well-known fashion houses throughout the world.  Building on recent success that saw consolidated sales revenue in May 2004 exceed 39 million Polish Zloty (PLN), a 27 percent increase from the same period in 2003, LPP has partnered with Accenture and Retek to implement new merchandising, forecasting and planning systems. The new technology provides the infrastructure required to support LPP's ambitious expansion strategy across Eastern and Western Europe. To expedite the implementation, LPP elected to deploy the Retek merchandising system with virtually no modifications aided by Accenture, who is involved in 90 percent of Retek implementations. Although typical enterprise merchandising implementations can take up to 24 months, the LPP rollout took just 10 months. The Retek Merchandising System (RMS) records and controls virtually all data in the retail enterprise and ensures data integrity. The solution helps users improve merchandising activities and better achieve sales and profit targets. LLP will use the new system to reduce inventory and markdown costs as well as increase sales. In addition, LPP is using Retek Demand Forecasting to produce highly accurate forecasts at store, SKU and day levels. This capability, in conjunction with the Retek Merchandise Financial Planning application that provides improved product, channel and location planning, is enabling LLP to better match supply with demand and optimize inventory performance. Retailers of all sizes and categories need toolsets to help them focus on strategic efforts to grow their business. By integrating the Retek products into its operations quickly and at low cost, LPP will be better equipped to make insightful, fact-based decisions, enhance its overall business performance and strengthen and expand its market position.

Gellner, who is presently the managing director of Adidas Malaysia, aims to expand the company’s Indian sector by opening 30-60 stores over the next couple of years. He has suggested that India, which is currently one of the company’s smallest markets in the region, may be integrated with neighbouring markets – for example Bangladesh and Nepal – in the future. Gellner said: "India is a high potential market. In fact, it has the capability of becoming the third-largest market for us in Asia, after Japan and China. At present, it is a very small market for us. We have plans to invest significantly in India in manpower and systems."  Another likely area to undergo expansion is the apparel segment:  "The apparel market in India is very big. Also, apparel is priced very competitively, more so because 99 per cent of the manufacturing for apparel is done locally."

Announces Second-Quarter 2004 Financial Results   Levi Strauss & Co. today announced financial results for the second quarter ended May 30, 2004 and filed its second-quarter 2004 Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Results for the quarter, as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, reflected improved gross margins; lower selling, general and administrative expenses; higher operating income; higher net income; and lower net debt.  Second-quarter 2004 net sales were $959 million compared to $932 million for the second quarter of 2003, representing an increase of 3 percent on a reported basis and a decline of 1 percent on a constant-currency basis. The sales performance reflected the continued growth of the company's Asia Pacific business and worldwide rollout of the Levi Strauss Signature(TM) brand. Net sales declined in LS&CO.'s U.S. and European Levi's® and Dockers® businesses. Key factors contributing to sales decreases of the U.S. Levi's® and Dockers® brands compared to the second quarter of 2003 included:   - 	the impact of wholesale price reductions taken in mid-2003 for both brands;   - 	a planned reduction in sales of Levi's® product to warehouse, club and off-price retail channels in 2004; and,   - 	substantial volume shipments in the second quarter of 2003 to fill retail shelves in conjunction with upgrading two major core Dockers® programs.  "So far, so good," said Phil Marineau, chief executive officer. "Overall, I'm pleased with our second-quarter performance, which delivered on our goal of improving our profitability this year. We still have a lot of work to do, but I'm encouraged by the progress we're making in all our businesses."   Source;  Levi Strauss &Co.

Sales in the second quarter were about $152 million, the Foothill Ranch-based company said. The sales estimate is about 8% less than the $164.5 million expected by analysts, according to Thomson First Call. The company had sales of $143.8 million a year earlier. Oakley plans to report second-quarter results July 21. Production shortfalls of the company's two most popular new sunglasses - the Dartboard and the Why 8 - led to fewer sales at a time when demand for other sunglass styles waned.   International demand for Oakley sunglasses fell, sales of prescription eyewear failed to meet company expectations, and online and direct sales were soft, the company said.  As a result, Oakley cut its earning forecast for the year. The company expects to earn 60 cents to 65 cents a share on revenue of $575 million to $585 million. In April, the retailer said it would earn 65 cents a share on sales of about $585 million. Analysts polled by Thomson had expected Oakley to earn, on average, 67 cents a share on sales of $585.8 million. The company's shares fell as low as $11.50 in after-hours trading. The stock was down 37 cents at $12.54 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The numbers are based on weekly reports from comScore Networks Inc. Sales for the week ending June 27 were up 31% from the corresponding week a year ago.  Total retail sales for the week ending June 26 were up 11.3% from the same week a year ago, according to ShopperTrak’s National Retail Sales Estimate.

The retailer's latest accounts for its UK division for the year to August 2003 show turnover of £882m, barely up on the previous year. Pre-tax profits slumped from £154m to £133m. In the accounts, the directors say that 'limited growth' was 'mainly due to poor trading conditions'. They add that 'poor sales performance was observed during the first half of the year due to the geopolitical climate'.   However, trading did improve significantly in the second half of the year, but not fast enough to prevent the profits setback. Though Ikea is still gaining market share, the rate of growth is stalling. According to retail research group Verdict, Ikea's growth in market share has slowed dramatically in recent years. Between 1997 and 1998, market share jumped from 2.6% to 3.3%. That had increased to an impressive 4.5% by 2000. But last year, Ikea's share of the market edged up by only 0.1 of a percentage point to 4.8%.

With total group like-for-likes down by 0.5 per cent across the quarter, the company said that in continued tough trading environment "strategic developments across all business units have been progressed" including the acceleration of the Iceland refit programme, and increased penetration of the convenience store sector by the Booker cash-and-carry business through its Premier.Big Food warned that price competition has increased in the industry over recent months and it "expects the more competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future".  Iceland like-for-like sales declined by 1.7 per cent across the quarter. Forty more store refits were completed and three new stores opened, bringing the number trading in the new format to 185.  New Iceland managing director Andy Clarke "is now concentrating on the sales performance of Iceland through a combination of measures to improve customer service standards", said the company.  At Booker, like-for-likes declined by 1.1 per cent, with non-tobacco sales down by 1.8 per cent. However, like-for-like sales to the Premier retailers by around 7 per cent, with another 131 retailers joining the badged group to bring the total to 1,586.

        GROCERY - TECHNOLOGY  &nbsp;   Grocery shoppers: Pay by cash, check or finger scan?    Supermarket shoppers soon will encounter a wave of new store technology that will make the self-checkout station seem quaint. &nbsp;    In the coming months, some of the nation's biggest chains will roll out biometric scanners, interactive kiosks and "smart" carts. They are designed to get customers to spend as much as possible and still speed their way out.  Grocery operators hope the big investments in technology will help them better withstand competition from big-box discounters that are making food a mainstay of their product mix.  Supervalu Inc. of Eden Prairie said it's close to testing a system that allows customers to pay for groceries by placing their finger on a scanner. Other chains such as Albertson's and Food Lion are rolling out "smart" shopping carts that allow people to price-scan groceries as they shop.  Those innovations will join kiosks that can take orders and offer product information.  Supermarkets traditionally have been incubators for retail technology. But experts say the furious pace of innovation reflects a sense of urgency by food retailers to confront big-box price-slashers.  "If you look at supermarkets today, they are scared of Wal-Mart," said Allan Couch, director of the food and drug industry markets for NCR Corp., a Dayton, Ohio-based manufacturer of kiosks and self-checkout stations. "They can't compete on price. So [they say,] 'What else can I do? How do I differentiate from Wal-Mart?' "  &nbsp;  All this technology isn't cheap for retailers. Installing one self-service checkout lane can cost $20,000, plus maintenance costs, according to IHL Consulting Group in Franklin, Tenn. Kiosks range from $3,000 to $7,000 a machine.  But retailers say the investment is worth it. Technology isn't a magic bullet, especially if Wal-Mart, Target and others eventually decide to use me-too systems. But a little bit of geekyness can go a long way to winning customers, analysts say.  &nbsp;  "Often, these new technologies provide a real spark to the shopping experience," said John Hauptman, vice president of Willard Bishop Consulting in Barrington, Ill. "It can be enough to tip the scales in favor of one store over another."  &nbsp;   Beyond self-checkout   Supermarkets introduced self-checkout stations a few years ago to allow time-pressed shoppers to bypass long lines, especially if they had only a few items. Now companies are trying to extend that convenience beyond the checkout.  Last month, Supervalu installed self-order kiosks at deli departments throughout its Bigg's stores in Cincinnati and Clarksville, Ind. Customers can punch in a deli order at the kiosks and return within 15 minutes to pick it up, avoiding the wait at the counter.  It's no accident that the Cincinnati and Indiana stores got the kiosks. Wal-Mart is a major competitor in those cities, Supervalu executives say.  &nbsp;  "We thought, 'What else can we do to differentiate ourselves, particularly from a Wal-Mart, and give us an advantage in service,' " said John Eversman, Supervalu's vice president of retail technology.”Areas like produce and deli are not Wal-Mart's strength, so why not take advantage of that?"  &nbsp;  In the Twin Cities area, shoppers soon could find similar kiosks at Cub Foods stores. Lund Food Holdings Inc. of Edina, which operates Lunds and Byerly's stores, already offer the kiosks at the Ridgedale and Chanhassen stores and is considering adding more.  "We view the kiosks as another type of service," said Dennis McCoy, kiosk project manager for Lunds.  Food Lion and Stop & Shop are testing a version of a "smart cart" that allows people to scan and bag groceries as they walk through the store. Neither chain operates in Minnesota.  One system, made by Symbol Technologies Inc. of Holtsville, N.Y., works like this: consumers use a handheld device to keep a running total of their purchases. At the checkout, shoppers scan an "end of trip" bar code on their cart and the entire order is downloaded into the register without any of the items having to be removed from the cart.  &nbsp;  The system is not perfect. A dishonest shopper could scan one product but place a more expensive item into the cart. Frank Riso, Symbol's director of retail industry marketing, said consumers must sign a code of conduct agreement before enrolling in the program. The retailer also will rescan orders randomly to make sure customers aren't cheating, he said.  With Cuesol and IBM's "Companion Cart," customers can enter their shopping lists into a Web site and then download the list onto a screen attached to their cart that maps the location of each product in the store. The device also highlights items on the list once the customer enters the right aisle.  Eversman of Supervalu said the company also is interested in the cart technology. One problem, though, is that those systems currently require retailers to have a loyalty card program to establish a customer's identity and track purchases. To "leapfrog" loyalty cards, Supervalu and Milwaukee-based Roundy's Inc., which operates the Rainbow Foods chain, are exploring a biometric-based checkout system developed by Pay By Touch.  &nbsp;   No more cash, cards   Consumers can place their finger on a scanner, enter a code and access a credit card or a checking account previously submitted to the retailer, eliminating the need to carry cash or cards. Pay By Touch says the system doesn't store actual fingerprints but rather a series of "data points" unique to each finger.  Eversman declined to give a timetable but said the technology's introduction is "imminent." John Boyle, Roundy's group vice president of information technology, said the company will test Pay By Touch in Milwaukee next month and soon could introduce it to Rainbow customers. The company also is developing a portable handheld scanner that allows employees to check out customers when regular cashiers are too busy.  &nbsp;  While all these devices help customers save time, other technology aims to keep shoppers in stores for as long as possible with a flood of product information and advertising.  At Lunds and Byerly's, shoppers can look up and print recipes from special kiosks. FarmFresh, an East Coast chain operated by Supervalu, recently installed EasyAnswers Touchscreen kiosks that offer information on health, nutrition, weight control and sports and fitness. The kiosks, made by Healthnotes Inc. of Portland, Ore., also offer safety information on potential interactions between supplements and frequently used prescription and over-the-counter drugs.  &nbsp;  "It often encourages consumers to make corresponding purchases in that particular department," Hauptman of Willard Bishop said.  &nbsp;  The technology also offers supermarkets a lucrative source of income from manufacturers who want to reach customers.  Shop 'n Save, a St. Louis-based division of Supervalu, now plays ads on 40-inch digital flat screens suspended from the ceilings of its stores.  Advertisers "want to catch a person's attention close to where their products are” said Ed Carter, senior buyer and ad manager for Shop 'n Save.  Eversman envisions transmitting promotions and messages to specific customers through carts, video screens, kiosks or checkout stations.  What's uncertain is how concerned people will be about the privacy issues implicit in biometrics and retailers knowing their shopping lists, or whether all the extra information will be welcomed or viewed as so much more noise by shoppers already overwhelmed by advertising.  "We try to strive for a happy balance," Eversman said. "We try to be careful. Technology for technology's sake can turn people off."

Leonard Teitelbaum, a Merrill Lynch food analyst, told the Institute of Food Technologists convention here this week that every 1 percent shift in what foods Americans buy represents a $1.5 billion market, and new product lines that appeal to lighter consumer tastes could be lucrative.  &nbsp;  "That's enough to get anyone concerned and excited," Teitelbaum said, noting that Wall Street can punish the stocks of food manufacturers who don't keep up with what customers want.  He said stocks of bread and chocolate manufacturers currently are feeling the wrath of stock holders because of the impact low-carbohydrate diets are having on traditional bread and cookie producers.  "Obesity is a big deal," Teitelbaum said.  But some consultants said the Atkins diet is just a fad and destined soon to go the way of the Scarsdale and grapefruit diets. They predicted the next food fad will be healthy, lower-calorie foods and products that can be marketed as "good for you, better for you."  "You are going to see calorie consciousness back," John Stanton, a professor of food marketing at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, told the annual convention of professional food scientists and industry representatives.  Stanton said he expects the Atkins fad to begin running out of steam in two years, replaced by a niche market for foods that are lower in fats, lower in added sugar and lower in calories.  "There are riches in niches," he said. "Obesity can mean fat profits."  Lester Crawford, acting commissioner of the U.S Food and Drug Administration, said his agency this year will propose the first revision in food labels in a decade, emphasizing the calorie content of foods. He said final decisions haven't been made, but he wants to make the type size larger and add information to the nutrition label.  Crawford said the government also is asking restaurants to come up with a way of telling consumers the nutritional content of the foods they serve.  "We're going to try voluntary, but if that doesn't work, we're going to come back to this," Crawford said, hinting that the government will consider mandatory regulations.  The industry adamantly opposes nutrition labeling, pointing out that consumers make so many changes in the way they want their food prepared that labeling would be difficult to implement properly.  Judith Stern of the American Obesity Association and a food nutrition professor at the University of California-Davis said the government's actions are much too timid.  "I am very discouraged about this," Stern said, contending that the government isn't doing enough to seriously address the problem of obesity in America.  "There's been a piddle response to obesity."  Stern said that government statistics show a startling increase in rates of obesity in the United States, with the number of teenagers classified as obese rising from 5 percent in 1985 to 16 percent in 2002, and a four-fold increase in the number of Americans more than 100 pounds overweight. More than 60 percent of American adults are obese or overweight.  Stern noted that U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics show that between 1985 and 2002, average daily calorie consumption rose to 2,680 from 2,220 calories. The government says the average daily caloric intake should be no more than 2,000 calories.  Stern said small reductions in the calorie content of restaurant food could have a major effect over time.  She criticized the industry for super-sizing portions to increase sales.  Over the last 50 years, the size of standard plates in restaurants has increased from 10 inches in diameter to 12 inches, and the content of muffins and bagels has doubled. She said cookbooks also have increased portion size, and some fast-food restaurants no longer offer soft drinks in small sizes.  "People should move more and eat less," said Robert Earl of the National Food Processors Association.  He said the food industry is being blamed even though most Americans eat a majority of food at home, and less than 5 percent of cooks are following government food serving guidelines.  Cathy Kapica, global director of nutrition at McDonald's restaurants, said her industry is responding to concerns over obesity by offering salads and low-cal Happy Meal choices of apple slices. In hopes of increasing sales of milk rather than soft drinks and juices, the restaurant is repackaging 1 percent low-fat milk into plastic jugs that Kapica said were designed to attract youngsters.  "Packaging is everything," Kapica said.  The company also is unveiling a new, slimmer Ronald McDonald and displaying the nutritional content of its products on tray liners.  &nbsp;   Better labeling   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is seeking the following, according to Lester Crawford, acting commissioner.   •   Food labels:  The first revision in a decade will emphasize the calorie content of foods. In addition, Crawford wants to make the type size larger.  •  Restaurants:  Crawford said the government wants restaurants to come up with a way of telling consumers the nutritional content of the foods they serve.

So instead of always waiting for the next mailed DVD, subscribers will be inclined to visit their local Blockbuster store where they may also purchase some candy or popcorn if not even rent an extra DVD or electronic game, Jerianne Thomas, director of marketing, tells InternetRetailer.com. “The e-coupons are a way we can differentiate from Netflix,” she says.  Blockbuster is also undercutting the retail pricing of Netflix, the recognized leader and pioneer of online DVD rentals and No. 30 in the Internet Retailer Top 300 Guide&nbsp;  to online retailers. Blockbuster’s basic offering is an unlimited number of rentals per month, with up to three DVDs out at any one time, for a monthly fee of $19.95. Netflix recently raised its price for the same service by $2, to $21.95.  The price spread between the two companies widens with more expensive service plans. Blockbuster is charging $29.99 and $39.99 per month, respectively, for plans that allow up to five DVDs or up to eight DVDs out at the same time. Netflix charges $33.99 and $49.99 for the same service levels.  The Blockbuster service, which is expected to officially launch in the fourth quarter, became available last week at Beta.Blockbuster.com. “The early response has been good,” Thomas says, noting that she was unable to say how many people were using it.  Blockbuster’s service is not offering the lowest price on the market, however. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s WalMart.com undercuts Blockbuster’s basic service price by more than $1, offering an unlimited number of DVD rentals per month with up to three out at the same time for $18.76.  Blockbuster hasn’t determined yet exactly how it will fulfill its online orders. But Thomas says it will consider fulfilling at least some orders out of its more than 6,000 retail stores in the U.S.   Source:  IRM, July 04     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&nbsp;    FOCUS   &nbsp;  RETAIL - ITALY  &nbsp;   Will Italy attract new entrants?

This is not the case, however, as many alliances lack cohesion in terms of the formats operated, organisational culture, structure and strategy. There is therefore significant opportunity for these alliances to shift over time resulting in the creation of new partnerships between existing and/or new like-minded players.

But despite sales of over 1 billion Barbies worldwide, the American icon is facing some serious competition for her fashion doll crown.  In April, her makers Mattel saw their profits slump by 73% and this week announced that worldwide Barbie's gross sales are down 13%.  So who is stealing her thunder?  &nbsp;   Real choice   Her main contender comes in the form of the Bratz dolls; Yasmin, Jade, Sasha, Cloe, Meygen, and Fianna are designed to be more streetwise and funky than Barbie.  Launched three years ago in the USA by Iranian immigrant Isaac Larian, over 80 million Bratz dolls have been sold worldwide.  In the UK, Bratz owns more than 30% of the fashion doll market and Bratz's UK distributor Nick Austin is confident that their share will grow.  "If you asked children a few years ago what they wanted it was always Barbie, Barbie, Barbie, but that was because there was no competition," he says.  "There was nothing else there and I think this is the first time that little girls have had a real choice on the doll shelves."  &nbsp;   Just like me   But its not just Bratz who want a slice of the UK's £100m fashion doll market. Barbie's old rival Sindy is planning to re-launch.  Sindy originally came on the scene in the 1960s as a very British doll with a girl next door look. She triumphed amongst British girls in the 1980s but was trounced by Barbie in the 1990s.  Denise Deane, design and development director of Sindy points out that "it's a very competitive time to make a re-launch, but we're confident that we have something unique to offer and that Sindy will be a main player within the doll industry".  Twentyfirst Century Sindy looks very different from her 1980s incarnation. She is more flexible than ever before and her manufacturers plan to market her to girls as a doll who is "just like me".  &nbsp;   Secure position   Mattel however is not taking any of this lying down. Barbie's target market is three years and upwards, while the Bratz dolls appeal to eight year old girls.  So Mattel have also brought out a much funkier range to appeal to this older age group; My Scene. Like traditional Barbie, this group of doll friends have a love of fashion but offer more accessories.  So far their strategy seems to be working; launched in 2002, their sales increased by 380% in 2003.  However, Barbie is still a bigger brand than My Scene and Barbie is clearly not ready to hang up her fashion doll crown just yet.  Despite the increased competition, Tim Kilpin, Mattel's senior vice president of girl's marketing, says her position is secure.  "We're very confident that we can continue to prevail and continue to be the number one girls brand in the world," he says.

      FOOD SECTOR - M&A   Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Acquires Silhouette Brands    Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Holdings Inc. has added firepower to its low-carbohydrate arsenal by acquiring Silhouette Brands, Inc. for $65.2 million in cash.   Based in New York and founded in 1994 by Marc Wexler and Sam Pugliese, Silhouette, whose brands feature low-fat and low-carb ice cream snacks marketed under the Skinny Cow and Skinny Carb labels, said in February it was seeking to be acquired.  For Dreyer's, the acquisition marks the next chapter in the company's ice cream-buying binge, which in February found the country's top-selling ice cream parent gobbling up the U.S. rights to Haagen-Dazs, including ownership of 236 stores.  Prior to the acquisition, Dreyer's acted as the national distributor for Silhouette Brands. Following this acquisition, Dreyer's anticipates significant administrative, selling, and management synergies; reduced costs; and raw material sourcing improvements.  As one of the fastest-growing partners in Dreyer's distribution portfolio in recent years, company officials said Silhouette Brands adds significant breadth to the ice cream assortment that Dreyer's offers consumers and retailers across the country. Silhouette Brands' executives, meanwhile, praised Dreyer's as an essential partner in its growth by providing direct-store distribution for many years.  Dreyer's paid Silhouette stockholders $4.76 for each common stock share and $6.56 for each preferred stock share held. The common stock price represented a 15 percent premium over Silhouette's closing stock price of $4.15 Friday.

That's according to new "5 A Day Foodservice Opportunity Gap" research and analysis presented by the Produce for Better Health Foundation (PBH) at a special 5 A Day Foodservice Summit held late last week in Monterey, Calif.  Hosted by PBH and the Produce Marketing Association (PMA), the invitation-only summit revealed a wide gap in fruit and vegetable offerings in quick-service, quick casual, family, and casual dining restaurants, "which presents an opportunity for everyone to get what they want - customers, operators, and fruit and vegetable suppliers," PBH foodservice director Brenda Humphreys told summit attendees.  Opening the conference by offering PBH's "State of the Country" address, Humphreys noted that public health, public policy, and consumer health awareness are converging to create an environment conducive to change among foodservice operators, especially in these dining formats.  "The foodservice industry has been taking a lot of the heat for the obesity epidemic," she said, adding that healthier menu options like fruits and vegetables offer chains a way to get out of the kitchen, or at least the kitchen of public opinion. Likewise, while the foodservice sector offers significant opportunity, it has largely been untapped by fruit and vegetable suppliers, Humphreys said, adding that with almost half of every American food dollar now being spent on food prepared away from home, "the industry can't afford to overlook the market potential that exists in foodservice."

Reflecting the positive mood of many logistics businesses, the company has put in a strong performance so far this year. Net revenues increased by 20% to CHF 4,246.9m (€2,759.9m) compared with the same period last year. Operating profit (EBITA) increased by 36.9% to CHF 181.6m  (€118m).  The good results were largely due to the performance of its air and sea forwarding division. Sea freight volumes grew by 25% with container traffic to and from Asia increasing by over 40%. Even volumes on the relatively weaker transatlantic trade lanes grew strongly with traffic up 12%. Operating profits improved by 16.3% in comparison with the same period in 2003.  The results were also buoyed by the integration of Pracht Spedition in Germany. The acquisition was a key driver of revenues in the company’s Road & Rail unit, with particularly strong demand for international and intermodal services. Meanwhile its Contract Logistics division doubled its operating profits to CHF20.2m (€13m) on a 5% increase of turnover to CHF581.1m (€377.6m). The unit has experienced problems over the past few years especially in the US, but a re-structuring combined with strong warehouse utilization in Europe has brought about a turnaround in fortunes.

"The growth is due to the introduction of a new hoarding campaign. At the beginning of the year we launched a two-week system replacing the previous monthly campaigns. This led to an increase in supply of billboards and cut display costs for customers," said company president Janusz Malinowski. The price of a two-week campaign is cheaper by around 30% than a monthly campaign. According to company forecasts Stroer Polska will post profits of zł.3 million on revenues of zł.100 million this year. In 2005 the company plans to invest around zł.10 million on further development of its services.

The approval was given after Brazil's federal audit court cleared Petrobras's plans. The company has asked for permission to study and drill the fields in the next two to three years to study their commercial feasibility.  The authorization includes the Mexilhão field, in the Santos basin, where 419 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves have been found, the Golfinho field in the Espírito Santo basin where the company has found signs of light crude and the Baleia Franca field in the Campos basin, the news service reported.  The development of the Espírito Santo basin includes a US$500mn investment plan to build gas pipelines to shore and a liquefaction plant. The basin is seen to reach production of 100,000 barrels of oil a day (b/d), from the current 40,000b/d, and 1.1 million cubic meters of gas a day, Estrella told O Globo.   Petrobras should speed up production plans for most profitable fields, including light crude production, which should help the country be self-sufficient in oil by 2005, bringing forward self-sufficiency target from 2006, O Globo reported.   Petrobras currently produces 1.6mb/d in Brazil, accounting for about 80% of the country's oil needs.  Estrella declined to say how much would be invested in the development program but said the company invested US$500mn in the initial exploratory activities.    Mature fields   Separately, the development of Petrobras's mature fields by small and medium size companies will depend on talks between those companies and Petrobras, ANP board member Newton Monteiro told local press.  Petrobras has operation licenses for 40 mature fields that have low levels of productivity.  Monteiro, who was sworn in last week for a second four-year term as ANP board member, said small and medium size companies would have to seek partnerships with Petrobras to develop the fields.  It is part of ANP's policy to use the cheaper development of mature fields in Brazil as an incentive for the creation of small and medium sized oil and gas companies and development of local technology.  The 913 blocks that ANP plans to auction on August 17-19 in the sixth round of oil and gas exploration licenses include several mature fields.

The three countries announced the launch of the East Asia ICT (CJK) Summit in Tokyo on July 26, with all countries agreeing to exchange information on markets, technology trends and standardization activities while encouraging business partnerships and strategic alliances in both the public and private sectors.  The working group will run through December 2009 and include officials from governments, research institutes and private companies. The agreement resulted from a meeting of information and communication technology ministers from each country.   Korea, China and Japan had been cooperating in expanding broadband Internet coverage and developing new IT industry growth engines over the past few years. The East Asian region has put itself in a position to become the trendsetter in the global IT industry. The three countries have agreed to set up an advanced framework to cooperate on mobile communication, next generation Internet and open-source solutions among other sectors. We believe private companies to benefit greatly from this agreement.  Under the agreement, the three countries will continue recent efforts to develop open-source software, setting up the tentatively named "Northeast Asia open-source software promotion forum," comprised of working-level officials from industries, research institutes and other related organizations to promote open-source applications.   In other issues, the three countries decided to cooperate in developing third-generation mobile telephony and other wireless solutions, encouraging joint efforts in research and development of communication technologies and their standardization.   The working group will jointly develop solutions for the next-generation Internet, most notably Internet protocol version 6, and radio frequency identification technology. The sides will cooperate in the development and promotion of IPv6 application services, while leading the experiments in setting up an interoperable regional network for RFID.

Internet companies would love to see them.  As digital cameras continue their sales boom, Web sites have found an increasingly attractive business helping consumers share their photos with friends and family.  This month, two online photo-sharing services were bought within a 24-hour period. The technology publisher CNET Networks will pay $70 million for a longtime market leader, Webshots, and Google paid an undisclosed amount for a relative newcomer, Picasa.  The announcements came on the heels of a series of improvements from Yahoo Photos that have helped it leapfrog Webshots as the Internet leader in photo sharing.  Why all the activity? Analysts said a resurgence in the online advertising market had helped, along with a seemingly insatiable consumer appetite for digital photography.  "The digital camera adoption rate continues to defy expectations," said Chris Chute, an analyst with the research and consulting firm IDC, who predicted that digital camera sales would reach 25 million this year. Including the 27 million camera phones that are expected to sell this year, at least one-third of American households will be able to take digital photos by year's end.  Chute said that 28 percent of digital-camera owners shared their pictures over the Internet and that cellphones and devices connected to home networks, for instance, would facilitate photo sharing.  Some online photo sites have had a surge in visitors in the past year, according to comScore Media Metrix, an Internet measurement firm, while others have leveled off. Yahoo and Webshots have had marginal declines in visitors, while Kodak's Ofoto.com, District Photo's Snapfish.com and Shutterfly.com attracted 25 percent to 30 percent more visitors. What is more, the value of those visitors has increased as the demand for online advertising has intensified.  Executives said those audience sizes were enticing enough for marketers to open their checkbooks. Narendra Rocherolle, co-chief executive of Webshots, said one reason Webshots chose CNET over other suitors was that it could help the company reach more well-known advertisers, because it already had long-term relationships with advertisers like Canon and Sony.  Webshots said it was profitable and expected to generate $12 million to $13 million in revenue this year, half from advertising and the remainder from selling premium online services and photo prints. CNET said it expected overall revenue for Webshots to grow by at least one-third next year.  Webshots, like several other photo-sharing sites, lets consumers upload their digital photos to a Web page on the site, free of charge. From there, users create albums, then e-mail invitations for others to look.  Webshots has faced increasing competition from Yahoo, which has in recent months added a number of features to enable users to share their photos more easily and decreased the number of places where advertisements appear.  Late last year, Yahoo began a service that allows users to view their photos on wireless phones. "So instead of Dad pulling out his wallet for pictures, you can do it all electronically," Jeff Stoddard, director of Yahoo Photos, said.  Even so, the smaller competitors have some advantages. Ofoto.com and Sony's Imagestation.com, for instance, have considerable muscle behind them, while Snapfish.com can rely on marketing support from District Photo, one of the biggest mail-order film processors.  Ofoto, Snapfish and Shutterfly.com have for years helped customers convert conventional photos into digital images they could e-mail to others. Now they, too, enable digital camera users to swap photos, or print them professionally for less than 20 cents an image.  Raj Kapoor, president of Snapfish, said the company had recently allowed camera phone users to e-mail images directly to their albums on the Snapfish site. This week the company will vastly expand the merchandise people can order decorated with their photos. The new items include dog leashes, baby bibs and neckties.  In this competitive market, Google's purchase of Picasa is particularly intriguing. Unlike most other services, Picasa is a peer-to-peer sharing application. Users open a window similar to that of instant messaging applications to swap photos.  Google declined to comment on its acquisition, citing the required "quiet period" for companies that are about to sell shares to the public.

Both the German chains have been expanding in France especially and Western Europe, while Lidl is planning an assault on Central and Eastern Europe. The markets Lidl is targeting include Denmark, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia and Slovenia, where Aldi has no presence. Both retailers also want to expand in Switzerland and Norway, but Aldi is focused on growth in Canada and New Zealand, which could allow Lidl to push ahead in Europe. At present, Aldi is almost double the size of Lidl in Germany. Aldi has a German market share of 9.4% and 4,050 stores, while Lidl has 4.9% and 2,522 shops. Excluding Germany, Lidl already generates greater European sales than Aldi - E9bn sales, compared with E8bn - and looks likely to beat Aldi to the Continent's number one slot.

The company attributed the reduction in net loss to lower income taxes. Net sales, however, increased 1.7% during the quarter to reach Y144.2m/$1.3m. Sales at Shiseido's core cosmetics activity were up 2.1% to Y115.6m/$1.1m, offsetting a 3.1% decline in toiletries sales which reached Y13.3m/$121,120. By region, the group recorded a 0.5% dip in sales in its home country, its largest market, to Y103.8m/$945,673. Overseas sales fared better increasing 7.7% to Y40.4m/$368,238 with European sales climbing 12.7% to Y19.7m/$178,956.

The Dillons chain includes 180 stores selling newspapers, tobacco and grocery items. The mooted buyer is private convenience store chain TM Retail. Tesco acquired Dillons in autumn 2002 as part of its £357m acquisition of the T&S Stores neighbourhood store group, and has never seen it as core to its business. TM Retail is already one of the country’s biggest newsagent operators, owning the Martin’s and Forbuoys chains. In a related story, Tesco is reported to have signed a licensing deal with eDiets.com, the US Internet diet service. Tesco has paid £2m to acquire the UK and Ireland rights to eDiets.com’s technology. Tesco is reported to be planning to expand the service to enable dieters to order products recommended in their personalised meal plan to their door.

Indonesia's "most admired company in 2003" in the toiletries and cosmetics category said it would invest another Rp4.5 trillion (US$500 million) in the country over the next 10 years.   The company claims that almost 99% of Indonesian households use at least one of its brands of soap, detergent, shampoo, cosmetics, toothpaste and food and beverage products, which include margarine, milk, ketchup and ice cream.   Indonesians get Unilever's highest-quality Lux soap at the lowest price in the world because, according to Unilever Indonesia's former president, Nihal Vijaya Devadas Kaviratne, the raw material is available in the country and the labor is productive and low-cost.   With household names such as Pepsodent, Sunsilk, Rinso, Surf, Lux and Lifebuoy, and the best-selling tea, Sariwangi, Unilever has cashed in on most, if not all, of several positive business factors in the world's fourth-biggest nation.   Net profits increased fivefold in the three years leading up to 2003, and sales are now more than before the 1997 Asian financial crisis.   Audited net profit surged by 33% last year on higher sales and amid strong consumer purchasing power. The company booked sales of Rp8.12 trillion against Rp7.01 trillion in 2002. Meanwhile, profit rose last year to Rp1.29 trillion ($151 million), or Rp170 per share, from Rp978 billion, or Rp128 per share, in 2002.   Dividend payments were Rp1.53 trillion ($162 million), or Rp200 per share, equivalent to 118% of Unilever's net profits for 2003. Unilever made the gesture to celebrate the company's 70th anniversary this year, but shareholders may have cause to be happy for some time to come as the company's strengths continue to grow.    Unilever takes off amid crisis  Though the company has operated in Indonesia for seven decades, it was not until the 1997 regional financial crisis that it really got into top gear.   Unilever and other multinationals quickly wired into the liberal investment regime in Indonesia in the wake of a change in the law in January 1999 that removed the 49% limit on foreign shareholding in Indonesian companies. A ban on foreign investment in the distribution business was also removed, making it easier for foreign companies to manufacture and distribute their own consumer goods. The protracted weakness of the rupiah in the years following the crisis and the consequent bargain brands for personal and household-care products also aided the company's expansion.   The company has made six acquisitions and joint ventures since 1999, including five local ones, the first of which was Yuhan. This deal gave Unilever the rights to the best-selling Moltos fabric conditioner and Superpell, a popular floor cleaner. Unilever then paid $120 million for Kecap Bango, the country's top-selling soy sauce. A portfolio of more than 65 brands was slashed in half to enable the company to focus on its strongest brands.   Private consumption has driven economic growth in Indonesia since the crisis, accounting for about 60% of the growth recorded. This, coupled with strong levels of household savings, a low-interest-rate environment and a predominantly young population, has helped lift the company's sales to new highs.   Though labor issues remain a problem in Indonesia, cheaper wage levels have been an added incentive for Unilever Indonesia to increase exports, particularly to other countries in the region.   Lower tariffs due to the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Free Trade Agreement are another positive factor. AFTA prompted the corporate decision to make Indonesia the regional sourcing center for a number of Unilever's products. Tea factories in Australia and Singapore were closed down and relocated to Indonesia, as were Lux and Lifebuoy soap factories previously located in Malaysia.  The AFTA agreement allows most products manufactured in one of the 10 ASEAN member states to be shipped to any other state at a 5% duty or less.   In addition to these factors, Unilever's expansion was also encouraged by the availability of raw material locally. The special taste of Kecap Bango, for example, derives from black soybeans, which grow only in Indonesia. To ensure continuity of supply, the company has struck deals with some 800 farmers who grow about 200 tons of black soybeans every year for Unilever.   Indonesia is also one of the world's major producers of palm oil, a primary raw material for many of the company's products. Industries under the Unilever group need about 1.7 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO) every year, equivalent to 5% of the world's CPO production, which is about 22 million tons.  Globally, about 56% of Unilever's business is in food, while some 44% is in household and personal care products. In Indonesia, the household and personal-care business is growing at about 14-15%, but this rate is dwarfed by its food business. Food currently accounts for about 18% of the company's total business in Indonesia, but Unilever expects this to increase to about 25% by 2010.    A prime export position  Exports account for nearly 6% of turnover, though this is expected to increase to about 15%, approximately $150 million, within the next three to five years.   Products for export include toothpaste, which is manufactured in Indonesia and supplied to the Philippines and other countries in the region. In addition, all the tea and soap for the Asia-Pacific region are now supplied from Indonesia. Tea is also exported to Japan and Australia. Ice cream made in Indonesia is also a large export item and margarine will follow soon. Economies of scale make production costs very competitive, compared with players with a small market share and ensuing high costs.   Even the poor can afford at least some of their basic needs, with the widely available single-use packs of Rinso detergent and Sunsilk shampoo priced at Rp500 (5.5 cents).   With more than 20,000 distributors and at least 2 million retailers, there is little chance of major hiccups in getting the goods to the customers.   Of course, it's not all plain sailing for businesses in Indonesia. Labor-intensive factories have shut down because of competition from China. Sony decided more than a year ago that it was not worth the hassles and risks and left the country. Many other businesses chose to relocate their factories out of the country at the same time that Unilever was doing the opposite and relocating several factories from elsewhere in the region to Indonesia.   But Unilever is a classic example of how savvy companies that have long-running exposure to a country and understand the risks are prepared to invest further and also to reach out to other committed multinationals. A 50-50 joint venture with Kimberly-Clark, for instance, now produces Huggies diapers and Kotex feminine napkins in Indonesia.   In the Asia-Pacific region, stretching from Australia to India, and to China and Japan, Unilever's Indonesia business is bigger than that in Japan or Australia, and second in size only to India's.   Unilever's strong position in the Indonesian market and economies of scale explain its full-blooded commitment to go forward and also why it may be around for another seven decades to come.

The deal changes the continent’s financial landscape, but it is unlikely to spur rivals to do the same  It was widely expected, but no less eye-catching for that. On Monday July 26th, Abbey National, a British building society turned listed bank, said its board had accepted a takeover offer from Spain’s biggest bank, Santander Central Hispano (SCH). The shares-and-cash deal was valued at around £8.5 billion ($15.6 billion) when it was announced. If completed, it would be Europe’s largest retail-banking merger across borders.  Many a pundit had predicted that the European Union’s “single market” project and the introduction of the euro would lead to a flood of cross-border mergers in financial services. But, by and large, banks have shied away from such deal - which is why some of those pundits are talking of this week’s Anglo-Spanish union as a long-awaited milestone. There are several reasons for this reluctance. First, national markets still differ in lots of ways when it comes to financial regulation and taxation; as a result, a financial product that is popular in one country may be a non-starter in a neighbouring one. Added to this is continuing regulatory resistance to foreign takeovers: in some European countries - France being the most notable example - banking is considered a “strategic” industry that should be kept out of foreign hands.  Not so in Britain, but approval is not the same as success. Santander is paying a premium for Abbey. This is only worth paying if costs can be cut and profitability boosted. Domestic bank mergers have been popular in both Europe and America because of the scope they offer to close branches and crunch together back offices. By contrast, cross-border mergers are usually more about extending empires than cutting costs - and, since many an attempt at expansion into new markets has come a cropper, stockmarkets tend to frown on such deals. In this case, Santander is stressing cost-cutting as much as revenue-building, with annual savings of €500m ($606m) mooted, much of that coming from replacing Abbey’s out-of-date computer systems.  For the Spanish bank, the deal marks the end of a long search for a partner that would give it bulk in another European market. Santander’s driving force is Emilio Botin, its chairman, who inherited a small regional bank, Banco Santander, and turned it into the largest in Spain and the biggest foreign bank in Latin America, through a series a bold acquisitions. In 1999, Mr Botin brought together Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano, a smaller bank. Since then, he has made no secret of wanting to get the group into the global top ten.  Britain was always the focus of his search for a new partner. The reason was, in a word, efficiency. The best Spanish banks make very nice profits - on the day the Abbey takeover was announced, Santander unveiled first-half net profits of €1.91 billion - and they want partners that are in the same league. British banks fit the bill: like their Spanish counterparts, they have been able to merge with each other, jettison overlapping bits of their networks, and so on. As a result, their return on equity tends to be above that of banks in countries like France, Germany and Italy, where obstacles to restructuring have held profits back.  However, Abbey is hardly the pick of the bunch. Having been a steady earner in retail banking and mortgages for years, it started to lose its way in the late 1990s - so much so, in fact, that it made pre-tax losses of £947m in 2002 and £686m last year. Dabbling in junk bonds proved particularly disastrous. Abbey’s life-insurance division has also been a worry, but the recent announcement that it would not have to stump up more capital under new regulatory rules was seen as removing the last obstacle to a bid. Abbey is halfway through a three-year turnaround programme designed to return it to its profitable ways of old.  Abbey’s rocky recent history may reduce the chances of a counter-bid emerging. Moreover, tightly run American banks are likely to balk at the premium payable, while most continental European banks simply can’t afford it. One or two of Abbey’s domestic rivals would like to bid, but they know they would face imposing regulatory hurdles. In 2001, Lloyds TSB was forced by the Competition Commission to withdraw a bid for Abbey.  The Abbey/Santander tie-up is not yet a done deal. Though it has been welcomed by Abbey’s board, the bank’s mostly British shareholders must vote on it, and many of them are less than thrilled at the prospect of their shares being turned into Spanish paper, with the currency risk that goes with it. However, they may still vote for the merger and dump their shares at an opportune moment soon after it is completed.  If the deal does go ahead, it would create a new giant in Europe, but it probably wouldn’t herald a wave of copycat cross-border mergers. As long as the continent’s financial-services markets retain their national quirks, banks will worry about straying from home turf. Santander’s rivals will want to wait and see how it fares as it grapples with its bulky British bride. After all, bank mergers have an unhappy history, whether domestic or cross-border: more often than not, the cost savings and revenue gains achieved (as opposed to promised) fall far short of the premium paid by the acquirer. Is it different this time? If history is a guide, probably not.  Source;  The Economist, July 04

         TELECOMUNICACIONES - 3G   Más de 100 empresas en el mundo listas para usar la tecnología EDGE   3G Americas anunció que 108 operadores de 63 países de todas las regiones del mundo se encuentran en distintas etapas de introducción de la tecnología EDGE de datos inalámbricos a alta velocidad, para brindarles a sus usuarios una variedad de servicios y aplicaciones de próxima generación.  Además de los 28 operadores que están ofreciendo servicios EDGE 3G comercialmente, hay 32 operadores que se encuentran desplegando EDGE de manera activa, 33 en etapa de planificación, 8 operadores con redes que tienen capacidad para esta tecnología y 7 operadores más que han informado tener redes EDGE en la fase de prueba. Con esta tecnología, las compañías multinacionales y los viajeros de negocios pueden utilizar un único dispositivo que ofrezca servicio en tres bandas mientras viajan internacionalmente a numerosos países y recibir servicio EDGE, donde se encuentra disponible, o bien servicio GPRS para sus conexiones de datos. Los clientes EDGE pueden esperar velocidades promedio para datos de entre 110-130 kbps, con picos de hasta 200 kbps cuando se utiliza una tarjeta módem EDGE en una computadora portátil, y hay varios teléfonos EDGE disponibles que también pueden utilizarse como módems para conexiones inalámbricas. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    NUEVOS MEDIAS - INTERNET   Terra negocia la venta del portal Lycos   Terra Lycos confirmó el miércoles haber seleccionado a un posible comprador para su filial estadounidense Lycos.  En un hecho relevante remitido a la Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), Terra dijo que ya "ha seleccionado a un posible comprador de su filial en EE.UU., Lycos Inc, por un precio inicial en el rango de US$ 95 a 115 millones". Terra Lycos dijo que su consejo de administración autorizó la operación, aunque señaló que aún faltaban algunos detalles para lograr un acuerdo definitivo. La compañía Terra Lycos no reveló el nombre del posible comprador, pero el diario español Expansión dijo el miércoles que se trata de un grupo surcoreano. La firma indicó que antes de la compraventa estaba prevista la transferencia de diversos activos de la filial estadounidense a la matriz, incluida la participación de casi un 30% que Lycos posee en Lycos Europe. Terra Lycos dijo a finales de junio que contaba con cuatro ofertas sólidas por Lycos tras anunciar meses a! ntes que estaba analizando y revisando determinadas unidades operativas, incluido su portal estadounidense. Terra Networks, la filial de Internet de Telefónica, adquirió en mayo de 2000 el control de Lycos en una operación valorada en unos US$ 12.500 millones. Tras realizar amortizaciones extraordinarias en los últimos años, Telefónica redujo el valor en libros del portal estadounidense Lycos a US$ 75 millones. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    CHILE - NEGOCIOS    La chilena Falabella compra supermercados San Francisco   El mayor grupo minorista de Chile, Falabella, informó que adquirió el control de la firma local de supermercados San Francisco, el tercer actor del rubro en el país, en una operación valorada en US$ 62,5 millones.  El conglomerado Falabella posee actualmente una cadena de multitiendas en Chile, Perú y Argentina bajo su marca, tiendas de artículos para el hogar Sodimac en Chile y Colombia, supermercados Tottus en Perú y es accionista de la red de farmacias Ahumada y de centros comerciales Plaza. Con este acuerdo, Falabella da su primer paso en el negocio de los supermercados en Chile, cuyos protagonistas son las compañías D&S y Cencosud y se consolida como el principal grupo minorista diversificado de Sudamérica. "La operación involucra la compra por parte de Falabella del 88% de la propiedad de Supermercados San Francisco en un monto cercano a los US$ 62,5 millones", dijo la empresa en un comunicado. San Francisco posee ocho locales, principalmente en la zona suroeste! de Santiago, emplea a 1.600 personas y tiene una participación de mercado de 7,2% en la capital y 3,2% a nivel nacional. En 2003 sumó ventas por US$ 160 millones en 31.000 metros cuadrados de salas. "Es un paso lógico en el crecimiento de Falabella. Si habían logrado entrar en Perú exitosamente en supermercados, el paso que les faltaba era en Chile", dijo la analista de Larraín Vial, Celine Bourban. La propiedad de San Francisco estaba en manos de la familia chilena Leyton Francione, que recibió su pago por el 88% en dinero y acciones de Falabella pero mantuvo el 12% restante. Los planes de la cadena de supermercados para el segundo semestre apuntan a sumar otros dos locales y la ampliación de una de sus tiendas en el sur de Santiago. Falabella destacó en su informe que un aspecto que fortalecerá este acuerdo con San Francisco es la eventual utilización de su tarjeta de crédito CMR, repartida entre 2,5 millones de clientes. "Con San Francisco van a intentar aportar una solución diferente al cliente, algo que los diferencie de Cencosud y D&S. Y su fortaleza va a ser su tarjeta de crédito, que está muy desarrollada con respecto a sus competidores", agregó Bourban. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    ARGENTINA - ECONOMIA   Una demora en la revisión del FMI no sería una catástrofe   Argentina reconoció el miércoles que una ya demorada revisión del acuerdo con el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) podría atrasarse aún más, hasta después del receso veraniego en agosto, pero que ello no significaría "una catástrofe".  Argentina está negociando desde junio la aprobación de la tercera revisión de su programa de US$ 13.000 millones a tres años con el FMI, lo que liberaría desembolsos del organismo por US$ 735 millones. El país utiliza esos fondos para pagar sus propios vencimientos con el FMI. "Mire, yo trabajo con la hipótesis de que eso es posible", dijo Héctor Torres, el representante argentino ante el FMI, sobre si aún creía factible que el directorio de la entidad apruebe la revisión antes del 9 de agosto, cuando el directorio del organismo toma su descanso anual de dos semanas. "Pero evidentemente los días pasan, el receso veraniego se acerca y, si bien yo sigo trabajando (para su aprobación), evidentemente es cada vez un poco menos ! posible", agregó. Las declaraciones de Torres son la primera admisión pública de que la revisión podría demorarse hasta septiembre, momento en que el FMI debería iniciar la cuarta revisión. Esa revisión es considerada crucial por los analistas porque ambas partes deberán acordar las metas de superávit fiscal primario para el próximo año, una variable clave para un país que está reestructurando la deuda pública incumplida de unos US$ 100.000 millones. "Si no lo hace (aprobar la revisión) antes del receso veraniengo, se hará después del receso veraniego. En definitiva, yo no creo que eso sea una catástrofe", dijo Torres. En su acuerdo firmado a fines de septiembre de 2003, Argentina y el FMI acordaron someter la marcha del acuerdo a revisiones trimestrales, lo que implica que la tercera revisión debería haberse terminado a fines de junio, aunque las demoras son comunes. La economía de Argentina ha experimentado una saludable recuperación y tiene amplias reservas para! cubrir los pagos al Fondo, pero en el pasado el presidente Néstor Kirchner se ha negado a cancelar deudas con el organismo cuando el directorio de la entidad demoró otras revisiones. Sin embargo, en esta ocasión la situación presenta un elemento particular. Argentina espera tener a mediados de agosto la aprobación del ente regulador del mercado financiero estadounidense a su oferta de reestructuración de deuda, y según los analistas sería riesgoso para el país lanzar esa propuesta al mercado sin tener el aval del FMI. La demora en la revisión también retrasa el desembolso de un crédito por US$ 500 millones por parte del Banco Mundial, cuyo directorio aprobó el préstamo pero lo condicionó a que la economía argentina tuviera el visto bueno del FMI. El Fondo dice que Argentina aún no realiza algunas reformas fiscales incluidas en el programa, como la aprobación de una ley que regula la distribución de los ingresos entre las provincias y el gobierno central. Argentina argumenta q! ue ha sobrecumplido las metas macroeconómicas del acuerdo y ha pedido una exoneración por la demora en las reformas, cuyo objetivo es asegurar el futuro cumplimiento de las metas fiscales y monetarias. "Lo que estamos diciendo es que no tiene sentido prender una luz roja, en un momento en el cual todos los indicadores macroeconomicos están 'outperforming' (sobrecumplidos)", dijo Torres. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    MEXICO - NEGOCIOS    La mexicana Femsa sube su utilidad neta en el segundo trimestre   La embotelladora mexicana Coca-Cola Femsa (KOF) reportó el miércoles una utilidad neta de 1.724 millones de pesos (US$ 150 millones) en el segundo trimestre, casi cuatro veces más que mismo lapso de 2003, por mayores ventas tras la adquisición de Panamco.  KOF, segunda mayor embotelladora de Coca-Cola en el mundo y unidad estelar de la gigante de bebidas Femsa, tuvo ingresos por 11.074 millones de pesos, un crecimiento de 17% frente al segundo trimestre de 2003. KOF se convirtió en la principal embotelladora de productos Coca-Cola en América Latina y la segunda en el mundo, tras concluir en mayo la compra de Panamco por US$ 2.700 millones, más US$ 880 millones en deuda. Con operaciones en nueve países de América Latina desde México a Argentina, KOF es propiedad en 51% de Femsa, mientras que The Coca-Cola Company posee casi 40%. En México, KOF enfrenta la dura competencia de pequeños embotelladores independientes como Big Cola y Jarritos, que han puesto a la venta refrescos de! menor precio en presentaciones más grandes, lo que ha causado un impacto negativo en los volúmenes de Coca-Cola y Pepsi. "Estamos enfrentando un entorno muy difícil en términos de volúmenes y precios", dijo Héctor Treviño, director de Finanzas de KOF en conferencia telefónica con analistas. Los ingresos de la firma en México sumaron 6.710 millones de pesos. Pero el clima fresco y lluvioso de mayo en el centro del país golpeó las ventas y los volúmenes cayeron 6%, debido principalmente a menores volúmenes de agua embotellada. México, el principal mercado de KOF, representó 78,2% de las ganancias operativas del trimestre, seguido por Colombia con 5% y América Central con 4,8%.(US$ 1 = 11,49 pesos al cierre de junio) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    PUBLICIDAD - INTERNET   El gasto en publicidad online será de US$ 16.000 millones en 2009   El gasto de publicidad en Internet casi se duplicaría en 2009, a US$ 16.100 millones, y representará una porción mayor en los presupuestos publicitarios, dijo JupiterResearch.  La publicidad en Internet crecerá un 27% este año, a US$ 8.400 millones, con un crecimiento de más del 10% tanto en listados de búsqueda pagos como en ventanas de anuncios, dijo Jupiter en un reporte. Jupiter es una división de Jupitermedia Corp. Se espera que la publicidad en este medio incremente su participación en los presupuestos de marketing desde 3,5% el año pasado a 6,5% en 2009. Los principales analistas de la industria publicitaria han pronosticado un crecimiento del gasto publicitario en EE.UU. de entre 6 y 9% este año, apoyado en la firme recuperación económica, las campañas políticas por las elecciones presidenciales y los Juegos Olímpicos Atenas 2004. La publicidad online es vista ampliamente como el medio de mayor crecimiento en esta categoría, seguido por la televisión por cable, en un ! regreso con gloria tras la explosión de la burbuja de Internet en 2000. Los principales anunciantes han incrementado el gasto en publicidad online ya que los consumidores dedican cada vez más tiempo a navegar en la Web, y tecnologías cada vez más sofisticadas facilitan crear y dar seguimiento a las campañas en Internet.

Entrevistado en Ginebra, donde se encuentra para negociar ese acuerdo destinado a relanzar la ronda de Doha y para cuya conclusión la propia Organización Mundial del Comercio ha puesto como fecha tope este viernes, afirmó que actualmente "el campo de juego está desnivelado".  De modo especial criticó el intento de fraguar "una nueva caja azul", categoría de apoyos internos destinados en principio a programas para limitar la producción, pero que Estados Unidos quiere utilizar para acomodar en ella las multimillonarias ayudas incluidas en la "Farm Bill" (ley agrícola).  "Tal y como está configurada la nueva caja azul, permitiría a algunos países miembros aumentar sus ayudas internas y los subsidios a la producción", criticó Redrado, quien sostuvo que "de esa forma se sacralizaría la "Farm Bill" de 2002, que debe revisarse en el 2006".  Sin embargo, dijo estar igualmente preocupado por el hecho de que el llamado "nivel de mínimis" (porcentaje de ayudas internas exentas en principio de compromisos de reducción) pueda sumarse a esa caja azul y aumentar el nivel total de apoyo al sector. Pero reconoció que en las últimas reuniones celebradas en Ginebra hay una voluntad de asegurar que cualquier cambio que se introduzca en la caja azul no sea "a suma de los distintos subsidios distorsionantes" de la competencia. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    BRASIL - NEGOCIOS   Arcor opera con Danone en Brasil   Si bien en términos legales se espera que la fusión con Groupe Danone para la creación de una sociedad conjunta bajo la denominación de Bagley S.A. esté aprobada el 2 de enero del año próximo, en la práctica, Arcor ya comenzó a administrar el negocio de galletitas del holding francés en Brasil.  Tras haber suscripto un contrato de management en los primeros días de julio, Arcor Do Brasil Ltda. se hizo cargo de las operaciones en el principal socio del Mercosur y así logró desembarcar en el único mercado de la región en el que no tenía fuerte presencia.  La operación forma parte del acuerdo para crear una nueva sociedad mixta que, además de Brasil, abarcará a la Argentina y Chile. El 51% del capital será controlado por Arcor mientras que el 49% restante quedará para Danone. Además, Luis Pagani ejercerá la presidencia.  A nivel local, Bagley se convertirá en la empresa de galletitas líder, con 42% del mercado; será segunda en Brasil, con 10%, y tercera en Chile, con 16% gracias a Dos en Uno, subsidiaria de Arcor. En total, producirá 255.000 toneladas anuales y reunirá un portafolio de marcas entre las que se destacan Saladix, Maná, Serranitas, Recetas de la Abuela, Formis, Macucas, Lía, Hogareñas, Opera, Rex y Sonrisas. Para evaluar el impacto del negocio en su operación global, Arcor contrató al JP Morgan Chase. En un informe elaborado para la compañía el banco sostuvo que la asociación con Danone "reforzará la viabilidad y la plataforma regional de Arcor en Latinoamérica, incrementando masa crítica en un mercado trascendental como Brasil". La entidad financiera estimó también que la operación le permitirá a Arcor superar los U$S 1.000 millones en ventas consolidadas y duplicar su presencia en el mercado brasileño. El convenio firmado entre Arcor Do Brasil y Groupe Danone se denomina Brazil Management Services Agreement y prevé que la filial brasileña de la empresa de la familia Pagani administre el negocio de galletitas de ambos grupos a partir de los primeros días de este mes. En el país vecino el holding francés ocupa el segundo lugar en market share, con 10% del total con marcas líderes como Triunfo y Aymoré. La producción del sector en Brasil es de 800.000 toneladas, 7% de la producción mundial y ampliamente superior a las 250.000 toneladas que se produjeron en la Argentina en 2003.  De este modo, la compañía de Arroyito hereda un interesante negocio que le permitirá posicionarse entre las líderes, puesto obtenido por Danone después de 10 años de actividades desde que, en 1994, ingresó en el mercado de galletitas en sociedad Cía. Campineira de Alimentos, dueña de la marca Triunfo. En 1998 llevó sus marcas Danyt’s e Break ’Up y dos años después adquirió Aymoré, consolidándose como una de las mayores empresas de galletitas de Brasil. Luego unificó todo bajo el nombre de LU, marca internacional de Danone, que fue fundada en Francia en 1846 por la familia Lefevre-Utile y que fabrica galletitas con valor nutritivo. La unidad de negocios LU opera en Brasil a través de dos plantas ubicadas en Campinas (San Pablo), y Contagem (Belo Horizonte). Frente a este escenario, el JP Morgan Chase destacó en el informe que la transacción provee una complementariedad importante de cartera de productos y canales con Arcor Do Brasil "que debería contribuir a potenciar la plataforma ya establecida en los últimos años en ese mercado". El banco también estima que "crea un portafolio combinado que agrupa a productos con años de tradición y con nuevas marcas en proceso de desarrollo", y asegura que la asociación con Danone "resalta la capacidad gerencial de Arcor, su potencialidad como socio para jugadores interesados en la región y abre una nueva alternativa de crecimiento para el grupo a través de asociaciones". - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    CHILE - ECONOMIA   Las fusiones y adquisiciones en Chile caen un 60% entre enero y junio   El monto de las fusiones y adquisiciones de empresas en Chile cayó un 60% en la primera mitad de 2004 con respecto a igual lapso del año pasado, con un total de US$ 769 millones, según un informe de la gremial Cámara de Comercio de Santiago divulgado el lunes.  Pese a la disminución en los montos involucrados, el número de operaciones aumentó significativamente, desde 15 en el primer semestre de 2003 a 30 entre enero y junio de este año. "No es posible concluir que el proceso de fusiones y adquisiciones se haya debilitado en el último año", dijo la entidad aludiendo a recientes transacciones. Las operaciones del período abarcaron una amplia gama de sectores, como telecomunicaciones, energía, industria, minoristas y servicios financieros. El negocio de las instituciones financieras concentró un 42% de los montos totales involucrados en el primer semestre. La compañía de seguros La Construcción fue adquirida por Bicecorp, mientras que el Grupo Security compró el Dresdne! r Bank Chile. El negocio minorista sólo registró un 3,8% de las operaciones en los primeros seis meses, lo que se explica básicamente por la venta de los supermercados Las Brisas al grupo chileno Cencosud. "Las recientes fusiones y adquisiciones se encuentran relacionadas a procesos de reordenamiento de la estructura competitiva de algunos sectores y en otros tienen que ver con la entrada o consolidación de actores internacionales", dijo el gremio en su informe trimestral. Para la segunda parte de 2004 se espera un salto en materia de fusiones y adquisiciones, pues a mediados de julio se aprobó la venta de la filial celular de CTC Chile a la española Telefónica Móviles en US$ 1.301 millones. En 2003 las fusiones y adquisiciones en Chile sumaron un total de US$ 2.855 millones, monto muy similar al del año anterior. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    MEXICO - ECONOMIA   Banco de México endurece su política monetaria    El Banco de México endureció su política monetaria por cuarta vez en el año, al incrementar el "corto", o herramienta de control, a $41 millones diarios desde $37 millones, después de que la inflación de la primera quincena de julio superara las expectativas del mercado.  El banco central justificó la medida citando aumentos recientes en la inflación subyacente -que elimina factores volátiles- alza en las expectativas de inflación en 12 meses, el inicio de un ciclo restrictivo en la política monetaria estadounidense y la recuperación de la economía mexicana. México tiene como objetivo una inflación de 3% anual, con un margen de un punto porcentual sobre y bajo esta cifra. Sin embargo, hasta ahora la inflación en 12 meses se mantiene persistentemente sobre el 4%.

Kirchner arribó a Tarija, capital departamental del sur boliviano, cercana a la frontera con Argentina, para encontrarse con su homólogo Carlos Mesa. El jefe de Estado argentino declaró a periodistas en el aeropuerto de Tarija que los dos países definirán una ampliación, en una primera fase, de las actuales exportaciones bolivianas de gas natural a Argentina, para llegar a 6,5 millones de metros cúbicos diarios. Desde junio, Bolivia exporta a Argentina 4 millones de metros cúbicos diarios de gas en virtud de un acuerdo de emergencia derivado de la crisis energética argentina. Kirchner agregó que analizaría con Mesa, un proyecto de largo plazo para el suministro de 25 millones de metros cúbicos diarios de gas boliviano a Argentina. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    COLOMBIA - NEGOCIOS   Ecopetrol Colombia y Petrobras firman acuerdo de cooperación    La estatal Ecopetrol de Colombia y Petrobras de Brasil firmaron un acuerdo de cooperación técnica para intercambiar conocimientos y buscar nuevas áreas potenciales para proyectos de asociación entre las dos compañías.

La negociación para la importación de lavarropas "no se agotó. Hubo apenas un intervalo, un punto muerto momentáneo", declaró Furlan. Los fabricantes brasileños rechazaron una propuesta de cuotas que limitaba la venta de lavarropas brasileños a la Argentina y reclamaron a su gobierno que "adopte las medidas necesarias" para que los argentinos no "alteren las reglas del juego de manera unilateral", informó la Asociación Nacional de Fabricantes de Productos Electroelectrónicos (Eletros), de Brasil. También indicó que las negociaciones para televisores se mantendrán. La crisis comercial entre Brasil y la Argentina se desató hace dos semanas con el anuncio argentino de que impondría restricciones a la importación de electrodomésticos (helad! eras, cocinas y lavarropas) y televisores brasileños.

        ARGENTINA – FINANZAS   El Senado argentino aprueba una ley fiscal que exige el FMI   El Senado argentino aprobó en la madrugada del jueves un proyecto de ley solicitado por el gobierno que limita el endeudamiento y el gasto de las provincias y la nación, una medida que exige el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI).  "La ley es necesaria para garantizar la gobernabilidad en Argentina y está marcando una conducta fiscal que las provincias estamos teniendo. La voluntad mayoritaria de los gobernadores es sacar (aprobar) esto", dijo a Reuters José Luis Gioja, gobernador de la provincia de San Juan. El proyecto, que ahora deberá ser aprobado por los diputados, limita el incremento del gasto público tanto de la nación como de las provincias de acuerdo con el aumento del Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) y de la recaudación impositiva, y obliga a crear con los excedentes fondos para enfrentar tiempos de crisis. La ley generó un largo debate entre el gobierno nacional y los representantes provinciales. Los opositores argumentan que el proyecto recorta la autonomía e! conómica de las provincias estipulada en el sistema federal argentino. Sin embargo, el oficialismo hizo pesar su mayoría en la cámara alta y el proyecto se aprobó sin modificaciones. "Se pidió una cantidad de modificaciones pero no se terminó votando ninguna de ellas. La realidad indica, y nosotros estamos en contra del proyecto, que si se modificaba la ley iba a ser vetada por el (Poder) Ejecutivo", afirmó una fuente de la opositora Unión Cívica Radical que prefirió no ser identificado. El proyecto busca ordenar las cuentas de los distritos en los que el pago de las deudas abarca gran parte del presupuesto y quita recursos para salud, educación y vivienda, tras una década en que las provincias y la nación emitieron bonos sin control. Las provincias y la nación no podrán endeudarse cuando el pago anual de sus deudas sea superior al 15% de su presupuesto, según el proyecto. Ese punto generó discusiones con algunos gobernadores que deben destinar un porcentaje mayor de s! us ingresos a pagar deudas. En esos casos la ley los forzaría a renegociar sus pasivos para alivianar la carga financiera. Y como una gran mayoría de las provincias tienen como principal acreedor a la Nación, el proyecto las dejaría bajo la presión de Kirchner para reestructurar sus deudas. El acuerdo firmado entre el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner y el FMI el año último exigía que al 31 de marzo pasado el Congreso aprobara esta norma. El gobierno también se había comprometido a aprobar un nuevo sistema de reparto de fondos impositivos entre la Nación y las provincias, pero el gobierno fracasó en lograr consenso entre todos los gobernadores porque la discusión de esa nueva ley implica una batalla por cuotas de poder en la que ninguno de los actores quiere resignar ni un centavo. Por ese incumplimiento el gobierno pedirá un "perdón" al FMI, que actualmente está realizando la tercera revisión del acuerdo por US$ 13.000 millones entre el país y el organismo. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    ARGENTINA – NEGOCIOS   Confirman que el Lloyds Bank se va de la Argentina   El banco de origen británico deja el país, como parte de una estrategia regional. Cuenta con más de 600 empleados y, según la Asociación Bancaria, el directorio de la entidad habría confirmado ya su salida. En el Gobierno esperan que se dé marcha atrás a esta decisión.  El ministro del Interior, Aníbal Fernández, expresó su deseo de que las autoridades del Lloyds Bank den marcha atrás en su decisión de retirarse de la Argentina. "A todos nos importa que se queden todas las empresas y todos los bancos. Ojalá se revea la medida", dijo Fernández durante una charla con periodistas, el miércoles, en el Hotel Grand Iguazú, donde se realizó la XXVI Cumbre de Jefes de Estado del Mercosur. Los directivos del Lloyds Bank ratificaron ante sindicalistas de la Asociación Bancaria (AB) y funcionarios del Ministerio de Trabajo que "la entidad se retirará del país" y señalaron que las decisiones sobre su futuro "están siendo consideradas en Lon! dres", informaron fuentes del gremio que conduce Juan José Zanola. Los gremialistas indicaron que las autoridades del británico Lloyds Bank se comprometieron a que el futuro de los 600 empleados sea resuelto "en el ámbito de la cartera laboral" y confirmaron que la entidad financiera pondrá en venta todas sus sucursales. La entidad pasaría a manos de un banco de capital nacional, y entre los candidatos a quedarse con el paquete accionario estarían el Sudameris, el Comafi y el Hipotecario. El Lloyds Bank tiene 36 sucursales en el país, la mayor parte de ellas (unas 24 unidades) concentradas en Buenos Aires y sus alrededores. Tiene 600 empleados y es una de las entidades que tiene una cartera crediticia saneada. Según los datos publicados por el Banco Central, a enero de este año la entidad tenía un activo de 948,4 millones de pesos, depósitos por 742,2 millones, y un patrimonio neto de 206,2 millones de pesos. La partida del país obedece a que el negocio bancario se! ha reducido mucho tras la devaluación, y a un cambio de estrategia adoptado por la casa matriz, que ya vendió la entidad en Brasil al HSBC y también estaría dejando sus operaciones en Francia. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    PERU – FINANZAS   El repunte de la inflación presionaría una alza de tasas en Perú   El aumento del costo de vida en Perú empujaría al Banco Central de Reserva (BCR) a elevar sus tasas de interés referenciales para no correr el riesgo de incumplir con su meta de inflación anual, tras su rectificación al alza de este indicador en mayo, dijeron analistas.  La inflación en junio fue de 0,56%, acumulando en lo que va del año una inflación de 3,01% y de 4,26% en términos anualizados, mayor al rango superior de la meta anual del BCR que es 3,5%. El BCR mantuvo en julio su tasa referencial a 2,5%, lo que fue criticado por los analistas teniendo en cuenta que la inflación anualizada ya superó la meta del ente emisor y la subida de las tasas de interés en EE.UU. "Este mes será clave. Si se cumple nuestra previsión preliminar de una inflación en julio de 0,28%, el BCR decidiría por una política restrictiva con una subida de tasas en agosto o septiembre", dijo el gerente de estudios económicos del Banco Wiese Sudameris, Guillermo Díaz, a Reuters. "El BCR ten! drá que evaluar en agosto si la situación ha cambiado (de tendencia inflacionaria)... el problema es que conforme se acerca diciembre podría poner en riesgo el rango de inflación", agregó. Otros analistas se mostraron preocupados por la demora del BCR en dar señales al mercado de que aplicará una política monetaria menos expansiva para tener controlada la inflación. "El ritmo del aumento de la inflación se ha acelerado, a mi opinión al BCR ya se le pasó el tiempo para indicar un cambio, si no reaccionan rápido corren el riesgo de salirse de la meta", afirmó por su parte el analista Pablo Secada. "Nadie va a salir a rasgarse las vestiduras si la inflación termina este año en más de 3,5%, pero está golpeando la capacidad de influenciar en la meta y la credibilidad del BCR", añadió Secada, del Instituto Peruano de Economía. Sin embargo, el presidente del BCR, Javier Silva Ruete, indicó que el banco podría disminuir la masa monetaria, variar sus tasas de interé! s o realizar operaciones en el mercado para frenar la inflación, según el diario financiero Gestión. La próxima reunión del Banco Central para decidir el futuro de las tasas será a inicios de agosto. Aunque la inflación preocupa en Perú -que tuvo su pico histórico en 1990 con 7,5%- su actual tasa es una de las más bajas de Latinoamérica. El ministro de Economía, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, mostró esta semana su preocupación por el incremento de la inflación, pero aseguró que se trata de un fenómeno temporal y que el BCR tomará las medidas necesarias. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    CHILE – ECONOMIA   Chile crece menos de lo esperado en mayo   La economía chilena creció un 4,8% en mayo en comparación con igual mes del año pasado, por debajo de lo previsto por analistas, luego que el buen desempeño de la minería y el comercio exterior fue contrarrestado por un menor aporte de la industria y el consumo.  El crecimiento más débil de lo esperado en mayo, que divulgó el lunes el Banco Central, acrecentó la posibilidad de que las tasas de interés no suban en la segunda parte del año, como originalmente se había pronosticado, estimó la industria financiera. "Esta cifra (de mayo) confirma que es muy poco probable que el Banco Central mueva (al alza) las tasas de interés en lo que resta del año", dijo Alejandro Alarcón, gerente general de la Asociación de Bancos e Instituciones Financieras. La tasa referencial de la economía chilena se encuentra fijada en 1,75 nominal anual. A principios de año el vigoroso crecimiento de la economía auguraba una gradual alza de tasas de interés a partir de julio. Sin embargo, la men! or expansión de la actividad en parte de abril y mayo, han puesto en duda un aumento en los intereses que podría frenar más el crecimiento. "Estoy un poco sorprendido con el crecimiento de mayo y sin duda que le quita ritmo a la economía, aunque sigue cerca de una meseta de crecimiento en torno a 5%", dijo Alarcón. El crecimiento en mayo, que se mide a través del índice mensual de actividad económica (Imacec), fue menor a la expansión de 5% en abril y de 6,3% en marzo. Con el resultado de mayo, la actividad económica acumuló un crecimiento de 4,8% en los primeros cinco meses del año comparado con el mismo lapso de 2003. "Con las cifras de mayo estamos obligado a esperar y mirar con más atención el comportamiento de la economía en junio y julio", agregó Alarcón. Para todo 2004 el instituto emisor ha pronosticado una expansión de 4,5 a 5,5% del PBI, estimado en unos US$ 90.000 millones. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    ARGENTINA / CHILE – ECONOMIA   Acuerdan con Chile acelerar ingreso de trigo, harina y aceite   Chile aceptó destrabar el ingreso de trigo, harina y aceite de Argentina, actualmente frenado por un sistema de banda de precios que aplica el país trasandino.  Así lo informó hoy en Puerto Iguazú el ministro de Hacienda de Chile, Nicolás Eyzaguirre. "Acordamos con el ministro (de Economía argentino) Roberto Lavagna otorgarle a los productos argentinos el mismo perfil que el que tienen los de origen estadounidense", indicó el funcionario durante una conferencia de prensa. "En el caso del trigo y la harina tendremos una desgravación más pausada, mientras que en el aceite va a ser casi inmediato", explicó el ministro chileno, según el despacho de la agencia DyN.  El sistema de "banda de precios" que aplica el país trasandino fue duramente cuestionado por la Argentina, que en 2002 obtuvo un fallo favorable de un tribunal de la Organización Mundial del Comercio (OMC). El mecanismo establece precios de referencia interno para mantener la rentabilidad de los productores chilenos, y a partir de allí se van modificando los aranceles de importación de acuerdo con la evolución de las cotizaciones. Eyzaguirre admitió que "objetivamente" la ley de banda de precios chilena "tenía problemas", pero señaló que las modificaciones realizadas por el Gobierno -"con alto costo político"- no dejaron conforme a Argentina. Chile, en realidad, le concedió a la Argentina los mismos beneficios que tienen los productores de Estados Unidos para ingresar al mercado trasandino derivado del acuerdo de Libre Comercio que tienen ambas naciones, con lo cual equilibra la competencia entre proveedores. Por otra parte, ayer el Servicio Agrícola Ganadero de Chile anunció la reapertura de sus fronteras para las carnes bovinas maduras y deshuesadas de Argentina, tras la decisión de cierre tomada en septiembre de 2003 por la aparición de un foco de fiebre aftosa en el norte de Salta. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    BRASIL – ECONOMIA   Brasil crecerá un 4% en 2004 según el ministro de Planeamiento   La economía de Brasil crecerá por lo menos un 4% en 2004, superando la estimación inicial del gobierno de un 3,5%, dijo el miércoles el ministro de Planeamiento, Guido Mantega.  La expansión económica más rápida de lo esperado se está produciendo en todos lo sectores y no sólo en el poderoso agro del país, declaró el ministro a periodistas durante un seminario internacional sobre fondos de pensión en Río de Janeiro. "Este año, nosotros vamos a tener un 4% de crecimiento, tal vez un poco más", afirmó Mantega. "La reacción de la economía es muy positiva. El gobierno hizo una estimación (de un crecimiento de 3,5%) y creo que será superada". El ministro sostuvo que "el crecimiento no es localizado, sino diseminado en toda la economía. Hay una recuperación no sólo del sector agropecuario, sino de todo el sector industrial". El Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) de Brasil se contrajo un 0,2% en 2003, primer año de gobierno del presidente Luiz Inácio "Lula"! da Silva. "Los empresarios vuelven a hablar en inversiones para ampliar la capacidad productiva", agregó Mantega. En el presupuesto para este año, el gobierno previó un crecimiento del PBI de 3,5%, y en su informe trimestral sobre la inflación, divulgado la semana pasada, el Banco Central mantuvo esa previsión. Según Mantega, el desempeño de la economía en el segundo trimestre, cuyos datos todavía no fueron divulgados, deben confirmar que el país está creciendo a una tasa anualizada de 6,8%. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    MEXICO – TECNOLOGIA   Telefónica Móviles implanta tecnología EDGE en México    Telefónica Móviles México, filial de la multinacional española Telefónica Moviles, informó hoy en Madrid de la implantación de la tecnología EDGE en su red móvil GSM para permitir ofrecer servicios de Internet por banda ancha.     La tecnología EDGE es un sistema que facilita la conexión y aumenta las velocidades de transmisión de datos de hasta 240 kilobits por segundo y navegación por Internet en la telefonía celular.  Según informaron hoy fuentes de la compañía española en Madrid, Telefónica Móviles es el primer operador de telefonía celular en introducir tecnología EDGE en América Latina.  México es además el segundo país de esta área en el que Telefónica introduce este servicio, después de que Telefónica Móvil Chile lanzara el mismo tipo de tecnología para sus clientes el año pasado.  En una primera fase, esta tecnología ofrecerá en México vídeo streaming (permite visionar vídeos sin su descarga previa en los móviles), vídeo streaming en tiempo real, y web browsing que permite convertir el teléfono en módem de alta velocidad para navegar por Internet, según las fuentes. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    FOCUS   MERCOSUR   El Mercosur aceptó incorporación de México y Venezuela    Los países nucleados en el Mercosur aceptaron hoy las solicitudes de México y Venezuela para formar parte del bloque en calidad de "socios comerciales".  El anuncio fue realizado por el mandatario argentino, Néstor Kirchner, quien en calidad de presidente "pro tempore" del Mercosur precisó que la incorporación de ambos países "serán efectivas una vez que se logre la suscripción de los acuerdos comerciales correspondientes".   "Aceptamos la incorporación de México y Venezuela al Mercosur", señaló Kirchner durante la XXVI Cumbre de jefes de Estado del bloque que se realiza en Puerto Iguazú. En conferencia de prensa, destacó el respaldo unánime de los países miembros (Argentina, Brasil, Paraguay y Uruguay) y los asociados (Chile, Bolivia y Perú) a las solicitudes de México y Venezuela. México presentó la solicitud formal de adhesión en Puerto Iguazú, mientras que Venezuela ya había hecho llegar oficialmente la petición hace un año, en la cumbre de Asunción.   "Habida cuenta que se concluyeron, para todos los efectos prácticos, las negociaciones para un acuerdo de libre comercio entre Venezuela y el Mercosur, los socios acogieron con satisfacción a Venezuela como el más nuevo Estado Asociado", indica el comunicado conjunto oficial. Según señaló la agencia EFE, el presidente mexicano, Vicente Fox, destacó que para su país el Mercosur representa "el germen de la integración" de la región, lo que llevó a su Gobierno a "reforzar los vínculos con todos y cada uno de los países que lo integran".  "México está convencido de que hoy la integración es la clave para lograr que América Latina y el Caribe se inserten exitosamente en el mundo globalizado", señaló el funcionario. En este sentido, el secretario de Relaciones Económicas y Comercio Internacional, Martín Redrado, celebró hoy la incorporación de México y Venezuela como países asociados al Mercosur. Redrado enmarcó esta situación en otro "logro muy importante" de la cumbre, "que es cerrar prácticamente un acuerdo comercial con el resto de los países de Sudamérica", lo que posibilitará que las "pequeñas y medianas empresas puedan exportar hacia el resto de América del Sur". "Vamos en el mismo camino con México y es, a mi juicio, uno de los grandes temas de esta cumbre, la venida de Fox, la incorporación al Mercosur y esto significa firmar un acuerdo comercial que le va a bajar las barreras a la producción argentina", agregó. El funcionario puso como ejemplo a los vinos para mostrar el beneficio que tendrá la Argentina con la incorporación de México al Mercosur.   "Los vinos en Argentina hoy pagan un 18 por ciento de arancel, mientras los vinos chilenos pagan cero. Argentina se quedó, durante muchos años, con una política comercial que miraba sólo al Mercosur y no a otros mercados", criticó. En tal sentido, explicó que la incorporación de los nuevos países asociados al Mercosur saben, a partir de la resolución de la cumbre de Puerto Iguazú, que "no hay atajos para entrar" mercado. "Para hacerlo hay que firmar un acuerdo de libre comercio y hay que adoptar la cláusula democrática del protocolo de Ushuaia, esto es que no puede haber un país dentro del Mercosur que no tenga un gobierno democrático. Cumplidas esas dos condiciones, están adentro del Mercosur", señaló.

        HIGHLIGTS    Legal – Human rights    urlLink The Age of Comparative Atrocity    American shame; Islamist snuff movies  It's a tough call whether Abu Musab al-Zarqawi-the Jordanian "militant" who is reportedly responsible for the videotaped butchery of Nicholas Berg-is more stupid than he is brutal, or whether he is a bigger monster than he is a fool. Zarqawi's own nauseating videotape makes the case for his indescribable brutality. The argument that he is Islamism's biggest lunatic yet-no small claim-is similarly straightforward: He has inaugurated an otherwise inconceivable display of comparative atrocity that could deliver his enemy from its own demoralization.   After all, Americans have been sufficiently shamed, dishonored, and demoralized by the repulsive images of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib that even many prominent war supporters have been reconsidering the effort.  Dispirited analysts at the conservative National Review Online have been looking for an exit from the occupation; blogger Andrew Sullivan has asked himself if, knowing in advance how the occupation would proceed, he would have supported the war to begin with. New York Times columnist David Brooks has concluded that the United States misconceived the effect of its own power, and has pronounced the occupation an intellectual failure, even if it ultimately succeeds in establishing a liberal Iraq.   What does Zarqawi do? In "retaliation" for the Abu Ghraib imagery, he stages a singularly nauseating "execution" of a private American citizen who has been wandering around Iraq. The probable effect is to offer many Americans an exit from their own moral horror.   Mind you, Zarqawi's ghouls in this video don't merely "behead" Berg, as most accounts indicate. "Beheading" suggests a quick severing and a quick death. What Zarqawi and his friends do is butcher Berg-there's no other word for it. They don't use a sword or an axe; they use a knife. You can hear Nicholas Berg screaming as Zarqawi's gang hacks at his neck and then pulls at his head until it comes off his body. They then hold his bleeding head in front of the camera. The tape is appalling not only for its utter bloodthirstiness, but also for the total absence of simple human empathy.  Elemental empathy-for example, an unwillingness to rip a victim’s heads from his body-is a primary measure of civilization. (The shame Americans felt at the Abu Ghraib an image is, after all, rooted in such empathy.) Even in the dehumanizing context of warfare, which strains the empathy of all its participants, this is savagery.   But if this is a moment of comparative atrocity, the issue becomes whether the Zarqawi horror is capable of having any effect on the Abu Ghraib images.  The probable answer is that while the murder tape obviously doesn't make pictures of prisoner abuse any less disgusting or shameful, it does offer many of those who feel disgust and shame a different context in which to perceive those images.   The Abu Ghraib pictures reveal American soldiers humiliating their prisoners in a sadistic manner (in some images, the Americans are actually smirking). It's a painful sight because it is cruel on its own terms (we don't even know if the terrorized individual prisoners are actually guilty of anything), and because we regard such sadism as unworthy of our image of ourselves.   Indeed, the pictures are sufficiently difficult that American newspaper editors are increasingly unsure how to play the images that continue to appear. Perhaps sensing a rise of "shame fatigue," some editors have been moving newer images to inside pages. As Washington Post editor Leonard Downie, Jr. put it, "[W] e decided we had published so many shocking photos that it was fine to publish inside rather than on the front page."   By contrast, Zarqawi intentionally tapes and distributes his bloody atrocity; the literal slaughter of an innocent is offered as an example of his righteousness. "Unworthiness" simply never enters the calculation; that it is inhuman is its point. Shameless brutality of this degree has the power to transform the shame of Zarqawi's enemies (those who seek such transformation). Zarqawi has reminded his enemies that, unlike him, they are capable of shame.   One rarely encounters an enemy willing to dehumanize himself this way. It's not unknown: Genghis Khan, sweeping out of Mongolia in the 13th century, sent out an advance phalanx of rumormongers to spread tales of massacre and cruelty, in order to encourage the cities in his path to surrender the more quickly. But that strategy was based on the Mongols' strength, and the relative weakness of the cities that various waves of Mongol armies were intent on sacking, (Baghdad was ultimately among them).   That's hardly the situation in which Zarqawi and his allies find themselves. If the U.S. has a military weakness, it's the one that Vietnam's Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap identified: Wars can be won on the American home front. But you try to win such a war by demoralizing the populace, not by demonstrating your own butchery. Revealing yourself as a butcher only encourages your enemies to find you and kill you.   That's the whole point of atrocity images and stories, both true and false, from Trajan's Column in Rome to the notorious false stories spread during World War I to the phony anti-Iraq baby-incubator testimony of the first Gulf War: to dehumanize the foe. That's the business of the Pan-Arab press: delegitimizing the American effort in Iraq by portraying it in terms of atrocity. In the case of an Al Jazeera, it has been to display civilian corpses; in the case of some Pan-Arab newspapers, it has been to augment genuine pictures of prisoner abuse with stills from pornographic films, and to claim that such stills are also from Abu Ghraib.   That sort of thing is recognizable propaganda in a classic mode. Zarqawi's righteous snuff movie is something different: an act of lunacy, a gift to his enemies, and, one hopes, an unwitting suicide note.

The biggest pan-Arab satellite television channels broadcast an edited version of the gruesome video, not showing the actual killing of Nick Berg, 26, of West Chester, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb. The businessman was abducted in April.   In one of the most explicit displays, Kuwait's Al-Siyassah daily ran a photo of a masked militant holding up Berg's severed head.   The video of the execution was released on the Internet too late for some Middle East newspaper columnists to react to it. The killing, attributed to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's group, appalled many Arabs.   Some opinion-makers condemned the killing.   "This shows how base and vile those who wear the robe of Islam have become," said Abdullah Sahar, a Kuwait University political scientist.   Some said it surpassed the American military's abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison, which has been the top story for the past 10 days in the Middle East.   "We were winning international sympathy because of what happened at Abu Ghraib, but they come and waste it all," said Abdullah Sahar, a Kuwait University political scientist, said of the Islamic militants responsible.   In the video, the masked militants said they were taking revenge on Berg because of the abuses at the Baghdad prison.   Mustafa Bakri, editor of Al-Osboa weekly newspaper in Egypt, said Berg's death will only hurt efforts to expose American offenses against Iraqis.   "Such revenge is rejected," Bakri said of the execution. "The American administration will make use of such crimes just to cover their real crimes against Iraqis."   Bakri spoke as he took part in a Cairo demonstration by about 50 Egyptian journalists and lawyers against American human rights abuses in Iraq.   Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya, the big two satellite networks, aired carefully edited versions of the video. In Al-Arabiya's edit, a militant is seen drawing a knife and jerking Berg's body to one side. The rest is not shown.   "The news story itself is strong enough," said Jihad Ballout, spokesman for Qatar-based Al-Jazeera. "To show the actual beheading is out of the realm of decency."   Lebanon's private Al Hayat-LBC station led its bulletins Wednesday with the video. Its news presenter said: "We apologize to our viewers for not showing the entire tape because of the ugliness of the scene."   Kuwait state television broadcast the news of the execution late Tuesday but not the video.   Iraqi newspapers reported nothing about the killing, although it may have broken to late for them.   Egypt's leading daily, Al-Ahram, ignored the beheading Wednesday. Two other major pro-government newspapers ran news agency reports on their inside pages, without photos.   An Al-Ahram editor, Ahmed Reda, said the news came too late Tuesday night for the paper to confirm the video's authenticity with the U.S. government.   Newspapers in Syria, where the government controls the press tightly, did not report it at all.   A professor of journalism at the American University in Cairo, Hussein Amin, said the handling of the story by Egypt's pro-government papers was political and appropriate.   "I think that the government does not want to show this on the front page as a main item because it shows a very poor - poor is not the proper word; disgusting maybe is the better word - example of revenge," Amin said. "There is also the threat that it could be happening to other Americans. If they put it on the front page, (it could be seen as) they are favoring this kind of action."   Jordanian newspapers, state television and radio reported Berg's killing, but without commentary.   Most Lebanese newspapers, such as the left-wing As-Safir, published the report and a photograph of Berg sitting in front of the militants. As-Safir ran the headline: "Al-Zarqawi slaughters an American to avenge Iraqi prisoners."   In many Arab newspapers, the beheading received less display than the news of America's imposing sanctions on Syria and the killing of six Israeli soldiers in Gaza City.

In Afghanistan, opium is everywhere. The United Nations says the burgeoning poppy crop produced three-quarters of the world's illicit opium last year, worth $3.2 billion Cdn and accounting for half Afghanistan's gross domestic product. Output was 20 times more than in 2001, the last year of rule by the strict Taliban regime.   Returning from a recent conference with donor countries, President Hamid Karzai called on Afghans to wage a "jihad," or holy war, on the drug trade.   It was a politically risky move. Poppy farming supports thousands of families and is a major source of income for many powerful warlords.   On a recent day, a counter-narcotics team in Kandahar province fanned out across farms, flanked by a dozen bodyguards armed with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades.   In the town of Karezeq, farmers confronted the team at the edge of fields pink with blooming poppies.   An elderly farmer begged for an officer to "be a good Muslim" and leave his crops alone. The response was quick: "It's the opium that you grow that's un-Islamic."   Eventually, they compromised: One-third of the plants would be uprooted. The farmers glumly watched as tractors tore up the earth.   Karzai's government says the goal is not to destroy farmers' livelihoods, but to encourage planting legal crops. While wheat and corn are nowhere near as profitable, at least the farmers know those crops will get to market, officials say.   The vast majority of the poppy crop is exported to meet the demand for drugs in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, but some stay at home, feeding a growing addiction problem.   In the slums of western Kabul, devastated by three decades of war, opium addicts gather in bullet-pocked ruins, sheltering in basement rooms littered with used needles and burned matches. They heat opium powder into a liquid and inhale the vapour.   Counsellors from the Najat drug rehabilitation centre scour Kabul for addicts, offering first-aid and encouragement. Female doctors meet at the homes of women addicts, and dozens of burqua-clad addicts come for checkups.  Each week, dozens of addicts hope desperately for one of the few beds Najat offers for in-house rehabilitation.   Once accepted, they spend weeks in cramped rooms, relearning responsibility and personal hygiene, receiving medical attention and counselling, and trying to get clean.   Feradoon, 42, can barely dream of kicking his habit. He meets every day with other addicts in the ruins of an old Kabul cinema.   They have no one else to turn to. In a culture where family is everything, these men are shunned by their relatives.  "No one can stop using this drug when he is alone," Feradoon says.

Quoted by wire services, US Embassy spokeswoman Victoria Alvarado says the embassy had used the warehouse to store furniture, and denied any US involvement in efforts to oust Chavez.   -   Venezuelan security services had arrested scores of Colombian right-wing paramilitary fighters, Sunday, thwarting a plot to launch another coup d'etat tomorrow, Wednesday.   A US-backed coup d'etat in April 2002 saw the imposition of Dictator for a Day Pedro Carmona Estanga who immediately dissolved the National Congress, the judiciary and the Constitution in one fell swoop, instigating a shoot-to-kill hunt for Chavez loyalists.  In Washington, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher trotted out the same old platitudes, rejecting Chavez Frias' charges that the United States is also behind the latest conspiracy.

Argentina is currently undergoing a serious energy crisis with domestic shortages and reduced overseas sales with diplomatic consequences in the region.Minister Julio De Vido  "The government decided the creation of Argentina Energy S.A., Enarsa, with the purpose of participating in the hydrocarbons and energy markets through the rational exploitation of resources", said Planning Minister Julio De Vido during a press conference in Government House in Buenos Aires.  The objective of Enarsa is to ensure the availability of gas and electricity at prices compatible with the economic level of the country and "rebuild reserves, production levels, gas supplies together with infrastructure needs in the transport of gas and electricity", added Mr. De Vido.  Enarsa will be made up of 53% non-transferable shares belonging to the government, 12% to the Argentine provinces and 35% will be offered to the private sector. Enarsa that is expected to associate with private companies to explore and exploit different fuels is the first government company in the local hydrocarbons market since the Argentine government privatized YPF and Gas del Estado in the nineties. Several private companies have anticipated they will work closely with the Argentine government in the energy emergency.  Brazilian Petrobras promised to double the transport capacity of its gas pipeline that extends 3,300 kilometres from Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego to Buenos Aires, which means an additional 2,8 million cubic meters in 2005 and another eight million cubic meters in 2006.  Repsol-YPF also is committed to increase gas production by 9,5 million cubic meters.  Argentina has abundant reserves of natural gas but the lack of investments during several years and a booming economy have caused a bottle neck with shortages both for the domestic industrial market and overseas, mainly Chile.  "If we have an energy crisis in Argentina today, unfortunately it's because corporations have not been investing particularly since 1998", said President Nestor Kirchner. The Kirchner administration also decided to increase taxes and retentions on hydrocarbon and fuel exports in an attempt to discourage overseas sales and ensure domestic supply.

A reporter at the scene said that gangs of young men torched and looted Christian properties on Gyadi-Gyadi Court Road in a mainly Muslim area of the city, triggering explosions in a cooking gas store. Police jeeps were racing around the area, with heavily armed officers sporadically firing warning shots, but security forces appeared to be holding back to avoid triggering a full-scale confrontation with the mob. Most businesses, including the main Christian market in the minority community's ghetto, Sabon Gari, had been closed before Tuesday's mass rally called in protest at last week's attack on the Muslim town of Yelwa. There was no sign of any casualties in the violence. On Sunday last week a heavily armed gang of militants from the Christian Tarok ethnic group stormed the mainly Muslim rural town of Yelwa, in the Shendam local government area of central Nigeria's Plateau state, and killed between 200 and 300 people, according to government figures.  At Tuesday's protest, Islamic leaders demanded that President Olusegun Obasanjo put an end to the Plateau state crisis within seven days "or bear the blame of whatever happens".

In Najaf, the clerical establishment and the shopkeepers have called on the Mahdi Army of Muqtada al-Sadr to quit their city, and to "pursue another way." It is in Washington where the lines are breaking, and where the faith in the gains that coalition soldiers have secured in Iraq at such a terrible price appears to have cracked. We have been doing Iraq by improvisation; we are now "dumping stock," just as our fortunes in that hard land may be taking a turn for the better. We pledged to give Iraqis a chance at a new political life. We now appear to be consigning them yet again to the same Arab malignancies that drove us to Iraq in the first place.  We have stumbled in Abu Ghraib. But the logic of Abu Ghraib isn't the logic of the Iraq war. We should be able to know the Arab world as it is. We should see through the motives of those in Cairo and Amman and Ramallah and Jeddah, now outraged by Abu Ghraib, who looked away from the terrors of Iraq under the Baathists. Our account is with the Iraqi people: It is their country we liberated, and it is their trust that a few depraved men and women, on the margins of a noble military expedition, have violated. We ought to give the Iraqis the best thing we can do now, reeling as we are under the impact of Abu Ghraib - give them the example of our courts and the transparency of our public life. What we should not be doing is to seek absolution in other Arab lands.  Take this scene from last week, which smacks of the confusion - and panic - of our policies in the aftermath of a cruel April: President Bush apologizing to King Abdullah II of Jordan for the scandal at Abu Ghraib.  Peculiar, that apology - owed to Iraq's people, yet forwarded to Jordan. We are still held captive by Pan-Arab politics. We struck into Iraq to free that country from the curse of the Arabism that played havoc with its politics from its very inception as a nation-state. We had thought, or implied, or let Iraqis think, that a new political order would emerge, that the Pan-Arab vocation that had been Iraq's poison would be no more.  The Arabs had let down Iraq, averted their gaze from the mass graves and the terrors inflicted on Kurdistan and the south, and on the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala and their seminarians and scholars. Jordan in particular had shown no great sensitivity toward Iraq's suffering. This was a dark spot in the record of a Hashemite dynasty otherwise known for its prudence and mercy. It was a concession that the Hashemite court gave to Jordan's "street," to the Palestinians in refugee camps and to the swanky districts of Amman alike. Jordan in the 1980s was the one country where Saddam Hussein was a mythic hero: the crowd identified itself with his Pan-Arab dreams, and thrilled to his cruelty and historical revisionism. This is why the late king, Hussein, broke with his American ties - as well as with his fellow Arab monarchs - after the invasion of Kuwait. His son did better in this war; he noted the price that Jordan paid in the intervening decade. He took America's side, and let the crowd know that a price would be paid for riding with Saddam. But no apology was owed to him for Abu Ghraib. He was no more due an apology for what took place than were the rulers in Kathmandu.  But this was of a piece with our broader retreat of late. We have dispatched the way of Iraqis an envoy of the U.N., Lakhdar Brahimi, an Algerian of Pan-Arab orientation, with past service in the League of Arab States. It stood to reason (American reason, uninformed as to the terrible complications of Arab life) that Mr. Brahimi, "an Arab," would better understand Iraq's ways than Paul Bremer. But nothing in Mr. Brahimi's curriculum vitae gives him the tools, or the sympathy, to understand the life of Iraq's Shiite seminaries; nothing he did in his years of service in the Arab league exhibited concern for the cruelties visited on the Kurds in the 1980s. Mr. Brahimi hails from the very same political class that has wrecked the Arab world. He has partaken of the ways of that class: populism, anti-Americanism, anti-Zionism, and a preference for the centralized state.  He came from the apex of the Algerian system of power that turned that country into a charnel house, inflicted on it a long-running war between the secular powers-that-be and the Islamists, and a tradition of hostility by the Arab power-holders toward the country's Berbers. No messenger more inappropriate could have been found if the aim was to introduce Iraqis to the ways of pluralism.  Mr. Brahimi owes us no loyalty. His prescription of a "technocratic government" for Iraq - which the Bush administration embraced only, to retreat from, by latest accounts - is a cunning assault on the independent political life of Iraq. The Algerian seeks to return Iraq to the Pan-Arab councils of power. His entire policy seeks nothing less than a rout of the gains, which the Kurds and the Shiites have secured after the fall of the Tikriti-Baathist edifice. The Shiites have seen through his scheme. A history of disinheritance has given them the knowledge they need to recognize those who bear them ill will. American power may not be obligated - and should not be - to deliver the Shiites a new dominion in Iraq. But we can't once more consign them to the mercy of their enemies in the Arab world. At any rate, it is too late in the hour for such a policy, for the genie is out of the bottle and the Shiites will fight back. Gone is their old timidity and quietism. Their rejection of Mr. Brahimi's diplomacy is now laid out for everyone to see.   For his part, Mr. Brahimi knew that the Americans were eager to dump, and he rightly bet on the innocence (other, less charitable terms could be used) of those in the Bush administration now calling the shots on Iraq. They were unburdened by any deep knowledge of the country, and Mr. Brahimi offered the false promise of pacifying Iraq in the run-up to our presidential elections.  His technocracy is, in truth, but a cover for the restoration of the old edifice of power. Fallujah gave him running room; its fight for a lost, unjust dominion, was his diplomatic tool. His prescription, he let it be known, would calm the tempest in that sullen place. The Marines were fighting to bring that town to order. The Marines were not Mr. Brahimi's people: Their fight, and their sacrifices, he dismissed as a "collective punishment" of a civilian population. Mr. Brahimi should know a thing or two about collective punishment. His native Algeria has provided enough lessons in what really constitutes the indiscriminate punishment of populations that come in the way of military power.  In the scales of military power, the Arabs have not been brilliant in modern times. But there is cunning aplenty in their world, and an unerring eye for the follies of great foreign powers. The Arabs can read through President Bush's stepping back from his support for Ariel Sharon's plan for withdrawal from Gaza. There are amends to be made for Abu Ghraib, and those are owed the people of Iraq. Yet here we are paying the Palestinians with Iraqi coin. The Palestinians will not be grateful for our concessions; and they are to be forgiven the only conclusion they will draw. Those concessions have already been taken as the compromises of an America now in the throes of self-flagellation.  We can't have this peculiar mix of imperial reach, coupled with such obtuseness. It is odd, and defective in the extreme, that President Bush chose the official daily of the Egyptian regime, Al-Ahram, for yet another interview, another expression of contrition over Abu Ghraib. In the anti-Americanism of Egypt (of Al-Ahram itself), the protestations of our virtue are of no value. In our uncertainty, we now walk into the selective rage of the Egyptians, a popular hostility tethered to the policies of a regime eager to see us fail in Iraq - a regime afraid that the Iraqis may yet steal a march on Egypt into modernity. Cairo has no standing in Iraq.  Why not take representatives of a budding Iraqi publication into the sanctuary of the Oval Office and offer a statement of contrition by our leader?  Our goals in Iraq are being diluted by the day. There has been naivete on our part, to be sure, and no small measure of hubris. We haven't always read Iraq right, but if we abdicate the burden and the responsibility - and the possibilities - that came with this war, our entire effort will come to grief. In Najaf on May 7, in a Friday sermon made from the shrine of Imam Ali - Shiism's most revered pulpit - Sheikh Sadr-al-din Qabanji, a respected cleric with ties to Ayatollah Ali Sistani, called on the Mahdi Army of Muqtada al-Sadr to quit the city. "Listen to the advice of the ulema," he said, using the term for the recognized men of religion. "Come, let us together find another way, and go back to your homes and provinces." The defense of Najaf, he said, belonged to its people, and the bands of young "Sadrists" were told to return to the slums of Baghdad. We haven't stilled Iraq's furies, and our gains there have been made with heartbreaking losses.   But in the midst of our anguish over Abu Ghraib, and in our eagerness to placate an Arab world that has managed to convince us of its rage over the scandal, we should stay true to what took us into Iraq, and to the gains that may yet be salvaged.

Or warned with threats as North Korea or Iran - although it was almost listed in President Bush's "axis of evil" speech.   But finally this week, the hard-line secular regime in Damascus is due for some punishment from an administration long divided over whether Syria deserves more carrot than stick in dealing with its terrorist offenses.  Congress pushed Mr. Bush to act by approving a measure last November calling for sanctions on Syria if it didn't shape up. The move was driven as much by political pressure to help Israel as to protect the US.  But it's clear American patience with Syria's young leader, Bashar al-Assad, has run thin because of his tactical feints in helping the US with post-invasion Iraq, promoting of various terror groups, and toying with weapons of mass destruction. A Washington eager to reform the Middle East can't wait while Mr. Assad plays old games of conspiracy and half-steps, despite having 130,000 US troops next door in Iraq.  The latest Syrian game is to claim that it too is threatened by militant Islamists after a bombing in its capital on April 27. But Bush isn't buying it, and in imposing sanctions this week, he's decided Syria fits the category of being a nation against the US because Syria isn't doing enough to be with it in fighting terror.  He's expected to bar sales of dual-use items that could have military applications, and will likely to restrict US oil investments in Syria as well as Syrian planes flying to or over the US - for starters.  The Western-educated Assad may want to help the US, but he's surrounded by old generals who thrive off the business they've long enjoyed in Lebanon by having 20,000 troops occupy that country. (Syria also allows Iran to use Syrian soil to support the anti-Israel Hizbollah fighters in Lebanon.)  The worst offense is Syria's unwillingness to prevent foreign fighters from entering Iraq across a 400-mile border. It may be calculating that the US is on the run in Iraq and will soon exit. Bush has every reason to send Syria a stern signal of US resolve.

        HIGHLIGHTS   GeoPolitica - Security   urlLink   Terror manual names Australians    Australians have been named in an al-Qaeda manual as the primary targets for terrorists in Indonesia. em>  The manual, targeting the Cities, specifies which foreign nationals to target in Muslim countries such as Americans in Saudi Arabia, French in Algiers and Australians in Indonesia.   Terrorism expert Clive Williams said the document was significant as it named, for the first time, Australians rather than Westerners in general as the number one target in Indonesia. Mr Williams also said it appeared Australia was increasingly named in al-Qaeda documents as a result of involvement in the war in Iraq.   "The rhetoric and the emphasis has been more on Australians certainly since we got involved in Iraq," said Mr Williams, director of terrorism studies at Australian National University.   Anti-terrorism agencies monitor large volumes of al-Qaeda material published on the internet.   The 11-page manual by an al-Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia, Abdulaziz al-Mokrin, ranks Australia fourth on an overall list of "human targets" behind Americans, British and Spanish and ahead of Canadians and Italians.   The manual also lists groups of people according to their importance as targets. Businessmen, bankers and economists are first, then diplomats, politicians and scholars, thirdly scientists, and experts and then soldiers. Tourists are ranked last.   Mr Williams said the manual was not a fatwa or directive to kill Australians but rather a "white paper" that terrorists could consider when planning attacks.  "Australia has been mentioned at least half a dozen times by al-Qaeda as a potential target overseas but this is the first time I've seen a reference to Australians in Indonesia, that they should be the target of choice," Mr Williams said.   "The danger of that, of course, is that Indonesians who are sympathetic to al-Qaeda might therefore think about Australians as being the primary target in Indonesia, which is not what we have been up till now."   Manager of security analysis at Sydney-based Intelligent Risks, Ian Shaw, said the manual was a concern considering terrorists in Indonesia were still capable of another Marriott-style attack.   A bomb blast at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta last year killed 12 people.   The manual gives instructions about establishing a terrorist cell and communicating with its members without being detected.   "The primary targets should be Jews and Christians who have important status in the Islamic countries," the manual, obtained by The Australian, says.  "The purpose is not to allow them to settle in the lands of the Moslems. Our advice is to start with unprotected soft targets and the individuals from countries that support the local renegades."

Michael Formica is repeating himself.   "It's all about low hanging fruit," said Formica, gesturing toward his PowerPoint presentation. "Low hanging fruit."  The commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division is referring to easily achieved tasks that will enlist the support of Iraqis who have come to doubt the Americans' ability to rebuild a peaceful, self-functioning country.    In laying out a summary of a plan to clean up the 21 neighborhoods for which his unit is responsible, Formica rattles through a list of short-term tasks that will create "instant employment, instant beautification, and instant change in perception."   The projects include rebuilding a market, renovating a youth center, and refurbishing facilities at a local veterinary college.    Buried amongst the maps and bullet points are colorful slides.   One of them suggests a future still unimaginable for most Iraqis in a neighborhood that now will forever now be associated with the worst of American behavior in Iraq.  The slide shows Abu Ghraib, the neighborhood that houses the notorious prison that has become the focus of the growing abuse scandal that has severly damaged the military's credibility in Iraq.  In this case, the neighborhood - a rough, low-income part of Baghdad teeming with men formerly employed by the Iraqi military industry – is reincarnated as a picturesque suburb with lush green gardens and neat rows of brick houses.  When the presentation is finished, a small, stout Iraqi speaks. In halting English, Dr. Majid Nassir of the Baghdad Veterinary College thanks Formica and his men. But then he adds, "Before anything, we must work on security."  Security concerns trump all It's a familiar refrain, one which has plagued the 1st Cavalry Division since it formally assumed control from the 1st Armored Division over Baghdad a little over a month ago.    It was a tough welcome. The fighting in April  - which resulted in scores of American deaths and hundreds of Iraqi casualties - was the worst since the war. Not only did the violence halt rebuilding efforts, it reinforced the growing Iraqi perception that the coalition has yet to accomplish anything.  "The biggest problem is that the coalition's been here over a year, and nothing's changed," said Col. Kendall Cox, commander of the Engineer Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division.   "So we've set out this low hanging fruit strategy. Find something you can reach up and grab and fix and show the Iraqi people."    A clean sweep?   The strategy is bound up in "Operation Iron Broom," a key part of the unit's mission "to defeat anti-coalition forces in order to create the infrastructure and economic conditions for the transfer to legitimate Iraqi governance" on June 30.   The $10 million operation was launched in Baghdad in March and encourages local participation in the reconstruction effort.  Some of these projects, modest in size and scope, show initial promise. A new walled market area just opened in Abu Dasher, a district with some of the lowest literacy and employment rates in Baghdad. The new space provides enough room for 150 to 200 stalls and boasts small details such as running clean water to improve sanitary conditions.  "This is the ideal thing we need to do. It's built by Iraqis for Iraqis," said Cox. "We're not doing this. We're providing the means and the money for Iraqis to do this."    As the colonel leaves the market, an elderly Iraqi man who has been guarding the market space approaches him. The man wants a gun to better protect the new facility. But Cox shook his head. "Right now, we cannot give weapons."    A new soccer field opened with fanfare recently. Following a ribbon-cutting ceremony, local officials sat under a marqee, passages from the Quran were read out, and two teams kicked off on the new pitch.  But surrounding the field was a seven-foot high fence topped with barbed wire; on opening day, dozens of young Iraqi boys clung to the wire peering through at the U.S. troops standing guard.     Case study:    Kerkh sewage treatments plant other projects better illustrate the challenges of rebuilding basic services in a dangerous environment. The Kerkh Sewage Treatment Plant is one of three designed to protect the Tigris River from raw sewage produced by the city's 5.2 million residents.    But a lack of maintenance, a shortage of spare parts, and extensive looting during the war have rendered the southern Baghdad plant ineffective in processing the wastage generated by two million people.    Since last year, Bechtel, through a contract with USAID, has been responsible for overhauling the plant. But two months ago, when violence flared across Baghdad, two plant workers were killed when their car hit a roadside bomb.    Both Bechtel and local employees immediately stopped going to work until the 1-8 Battalion of the 1st Cavalry showed up to secure the plant premises.

The change in prison procedure comes during a widening scandal into prisoner abuse in Iraq.  Lt. Gen. David Barno said the military had looked into "challenges and problems" at holding facilities in Afghanistan. He didn't say what the allegations were, or if any of them had proved true.   "One of the things we've done recently is to reduce the amount of time we're allowing local (American) commanders to have people in their temporary facilities before they come to Bagram," the main U.S. base north of Kabul, Barno said. Barno was responding to a question about reported complaints by former detainees of abuse during the past year at bases including Gardez in eastern Afghanistan and Kandahar, in the south.  He said all complaints were investigated and "appropriate action" taken as a result.  "I am aware of a number of the allegations out there. We have run a series of investigations on some of the challenges and problems that have been brought up with some of the remote holding facilities," he said.   The military opened a formal investigation into the deaths of two Afghans at Bagram's closely guarded jail in December 2002, but says it has had trouble-gathering evidence and has yet to release results.  Autopsies found that both men died of blunt force injuries.  A third Afghan died last June at a holding facility in eastern Kunar province. A U.S. intelligence official said last week the CIA inspector general is investigating that death because it involved an independent contractor working for the agency.  Barno said "a number of very significant changes" were made at Bagram as a result of those deaths, but the military refuses to give details of its prison regime.  "I'm very confident in our procedures there," he said.  The military insists it is treating its prisoners in Afghanistan humanely, saying Bagram receives regular visits from officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  "I'm very confident in our procedures there," Barno said.  But human rights groups point to lingering allegations of torture from former prisoners held at a network of secretive American jails across Afghanistan.  The U.S. military views Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners as "unlawful combatants," and has held hundreds captured in the 2001 war for more than two years without formal charge or access to lawyers.  It conducted a major review of its Bagram jail again in March, but it is unclear if that review was prompted by the investigation of abuse of prisoners in Iraq.  The military in Afghanistan has refused to comment on findings in an internal Army report that prison guards in Iraq and Afghanistan were told to "soften up" prisoners so they would be more cooperative in interrogations.

Israel and the United States suspect Iran is secretly building nuclear weapons under cover of a nuclear energy program. In the past, Israel has said it would not allow Iran to build a nuclear bomb.   In 1981, Israeli fighter-bombers destroyed a nuclear reactor that was under construction outside Baghdad because it feared Iraq would acquire a nuclear weapon.   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said last month Iran was a threat to Israel, ``maybe the main existential threat.''   In an interview with state television, Iran's chief negotiator on nuclear affairs, Hasan Rowhani, warned that an Israeli attack would have severe consequences.   ``Israel knows our hands are well equipped,'' Rowhani said. ``If such an incident happens, it will meet a resolute response from our side.''   Rowhani did not explain what he meant by saying Iran was ``well equipped,'' but Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said in December that Iran would strike back with long-range missiles if Israel were to attack its nuclear facilities.   Shamkhani said Iran's Shahab-3 missile, which has a range of about 810 miles, would be one of the weapons used. Israel is about 600 miles west of Iran.   Suspicion of Israel and its agents is pervasive in Iran. On Saturday, Iran's armed forces closed the new Imam Khomeini International Airport on its first day of scheduled flights. Citing security concerns, the armed forces spoke of possible links between Israel and a Turkish company that has a contract to operate the airport. The Turkish company rejected the allegation.     Turkey has military links with Israel.     Iran is building its first nuclear reactor, which is expected to come on stream next year. It has been criticized by the International Atomic Energy Agency for failing to disclose certain aspects of its nuclear program. Iran has promised to cooperate fully with IAEA inspectors and insists its program is for peaceful purposes.

The U.S. government is investigating Chiquita Brands International Inc. for making "protection" payments to certain Colombian groups, which the U.S. says, are terrorist organizations, the company said Monday.   The announcement came on the same day the Cincinnati-based distributor of bananas and other fresh fruits reported first-quarter net income falling to $20 million, or 46 cents per share, from $25 million, or 62 cents, a year ago.   Chiquita Chief Executive Fernando Aguirre said in a conference call with analysts that the company is taking the investigation "very seriously, but believe it's manageable."   "I want to stress that this issue only involves our Colombia subsidiary," Aguirre said.     The Department of Justice recently indicated it will be evaluating the role and conduct of the company and some of its officers into a matter involving Chiquita's banana subsidiary in Colombia, Chiquita said.   In April 2003, the company's management and audit committee voluntarily disclosed to the Justice Department that its subsidiary had been forced to make "protection" payments, according to Chiquita.   The payments went to certain groups in Colombia that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations under U.S. law, the company said.   Chiquita said the groups made threats against the company's workers and that it made the payments only to protect its employees.   Chiquita disclosed the matter to the Justice Department when the company learned that supporting such a federally labeled terrorist organization is a criminal act under a U.S. statute, the company said.   It is an open secret in Colombia that companies are occasionally forced to buy off illegal armed groups fighting in the country's four-decade-old war, but Chiquita's admission appeared unprecedented.   Chiquita ships bananas from plants in northern Colombia in areas with a heavy presence of the outlawed far-right United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, which is responsible for some of the worst human rights abuses in recent Colombian history.   Known by its Spanish initials AUC, it has killed thousands of people, mainly peasants, for suspected links to Marxist rebels over the past few years. It also traffics cocaine, according to U.S. officials.   Human rights groups say the AUC worked closely with the army in a push against rebels in the Uraba banana-growing region in the 1990s. The government says any soldiers caught cooperating with the AUC will be prosecuted.   The AUC, now negotiating peace with the government, has targeted unions, which it often accuses of being guerrilla fronts.   A Colombian union is currently trying to sue Coca Cola (KO: Research, Estimates) for the murder of a worker by paramilitaries at a bottling plant in 1996. The soft-drink company says it had nothing to do with the incident.  Banana prices this year fell sharply from the year-earlier period, when flooding in Costa Rica and Panama limited supply.   Net sales for the quarter rose to $793 million from $471 million a year earlier. Atlanta AG, a German fresh produce distributor acquired at the end of March 2003, accounted for $283 million of the increase, Chiquita said.   The remainder resulted from favorable European exchange rates and increased sales of other fresh produce, the company said.   The company said it is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation.   Shares of Chiquita (CQB: Research, Estimates) fell 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $17.10 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange before the company’s late-day announcement.

In Iraq, the most important prisoners are kept in a huge hangar near the runway at Baghdad International Airport, say U.S. government officials, counterterrorism experts and others. In Qatar, U.S. forces have been ferrying some Iraqi prisoners to a remote jail on the gigantic U.S. air base in the desert.  The Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, where a unit of U.S. soldiers abused prisoners, is just the largest and suddenly most notorious in a worldwide constellation of detention centers -- many of them secret and all off-limits to public scrutiny - that the U.S. military and CIA have operated in the name of counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  These prisons and jails are sometimes as small as shipping containers and as large as the sprawling Guantanamo Bay complex in Cuba. They are part of an elaborate CIA and military infrastructure whose purpose is to hold suspected terrorists or insurgents for interrogation and safe-keeping while avoiding U.S. or international court systems, where proceedings and evidence against the accused would be aired in public.  Some are even held by foreign governments at the informal request of the United States.   "The number of people who have been detained in the Arab world for the sake of America is much more than in Guantanamo Bay. Really, thousands," said Najeeb Nuaimi, a former justice minister of Qatar who is representing the families of dozens of prisoners.   The largely hidden array includes three systems that only rarely overlap: the Pentagon-run network of prisons, jails and holding facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and elsewhere; small and secret CIA-run facilities where top al Qaeda and other figures are kept; and interrogation rooms of foreign intelligence services – some with documented records of torture - to which the U.S. government delivers or "renders" mid- or low-level terrorism suspects for questioning.   All told, more than 9,000 people are held by U.S. authorities overseas, according to Pentagon figures and estimates by intelligence experts, the vast majority under military control. The detainees have no conventional legal rights: no access to a lawyer; no chance for an impartial hearing; and at least in the case of prisoners held in cellblock 1A at Abu Ghraib, no apparent guarantee of humane treatment accorded prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions or civilians in U.S. jails.  Although some of those held by the military in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo have had visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross, some of the CIA's detainees have, in effect, disappeared, according to interviews with former and current national security officials and to the Army's report of abuses at Abu Ghraib.  The CIA's "ghost detainees," as they were called by members of the 800th MP Brigade, were routinely held by the soldier-guards at Abu Ghraib "without accounting for them, knowing their identities, or even the reason for their detention," the report says. These phantom captives were "moved around within the facility to hide them" from Red Cross teams, a tactic that was "deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine, and in violation of international law."  CIA employees are under investigation by the Justice Department and the CIA inspector general's office in connection with the death of three captives in the past six months, two who died while under interrogation in Iraq, and a third who was being questioned by a CIA contract interrogator in Afghanistan. A CIA spokesman said the hiding of detainees was inappropriate. He declined to comment further.  None of the arrangements that permit U.S. personnel to kidnap,transport, interrogate and hold foreigners are ad hoc or unauthorized, including the so-called renditions. "People tend to regard it as an extra-judicial kidnapping; it's not," former CIA officer Peter Probst said. "There is a long history of this. It has been done for decades. It's absolutely legal."  In fact, every aspect of this new universe - including maintenance of covert airlines to fly prisoners from place to place, interrogation rules and the legal justification for holding foreigners without due process afforded most U.S. citizens - has been developed by military or CIA lawyers, vetted by Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and, depending on the particular issue, approved by White House General Counsel's Office or the president himself.  In some cases, such as determining whether a U.S. citizen should be designated an enemy combatant who can be held without charges, the president makes the final decision, said Alberto R. Gonzales, counsel to the president, in a Feb. 24 speech to the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Law and National Security.  Critics of this kind of detention and treatment, Gonzales said, "assumed that there was little or no analysis - legal or otherwise - behind the decision to detain a particular person as enemy combatant."  On the contrary, the administration has applied the law of war, he said. "Under these rules, captured enemy combatants, whether soldiers or saboteurs, may be detained for the duration of hostilities."  Because most of the directives and guidelines on these issues are classified, former and current military and intelligence officials who described them to The Washington Post would do so only on the condition that they not be named.  Along with other CIA and military efforts to disrupt terrorist plots and break up al Qaeda's financial networks, administration officials argue that the interrogations are a key component of their global counterterrorism strategy and counterinsurgency operations in Iraq. As the CIA's deputy director, John McLaughlin, recently told the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks: "The country, with all its capabilities, is now much more orchestrated into an offensive mix that is relentless."    Military jails and prisons   Abu Ghraib prison - where photographs were taken that have enraged the Arab world and rocked U.S. political and military leadership - held 6,000 to 7,000 detainees at the time of the documented abuse. Today, it and other sites in Iraq hold more than 8,000 prisoners, U.S. and coalition officials said. They range from those believed to have played key roles in the insurgency to some who are held on suspicion of petty crimes.  Until the current scandal cast some hazy light, little has been publicly known about the Iraqi detention sites, their locations and who was being held there. That has been a source of continuing frustration for international monitoring groups such as New York-based Human Rights Watch, which has repeatedly sought to visit the facilities. Even the military's investigative report on abuses at Abu Ghraib remains classified, despite having become public through leaks.  Far better known has been the Defense Department's facility at Guantanamo Bay. The open-air camps there house about 600 detainees, flown in from around the world over the past two years. Secrecy there remains tight, with detainees and most of the facilities off-limits to visitors.  The U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether detainees held there, whom the Pentagon has declared "enemy combatants" in the war against terrorism, should have access to U.S. courts.  Last week, the U.S. military acknowledged that two Guantanamo Bay guards had been disciplined in connection with use of excessive force against detainees. And U.S. defense officials confirmed the existence of a list of approved interrogation techniques, dating to April 2003, that included reversing sleep patterns, exposing prisoners to hot and cold, and "sensory assault," including use of bright lights and loud music.  The treatment of prisoners in Afghanistan has received less public attention.  The U.S. military holds 300 or so people at Bagram, north of the capital of Kabul, and in Kandahar, Jalalabad and Asadabad. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 700 people had been released from those sites, most of them held a few weeks or less. Special Forces units also have holding centers at their firebases, including at Gardez and Khost.   In December 2002, two Afghans died in U.S. custody in Afghanistan. The U.S. military classified both as homicides. Another Afghan died in June 2003 at a detention site near Asadabad.  "Afghans detained at Bagram airbase in 2002 have described being held in detention for weeks, continuously shackled, intentionally kept awake for extended periods of time, and forced to kneel or stand in painful positions for extended periods," according to a report in March by Human Rights Watch. "Some say they were kicked and beaten when arrested, or later as part of efforts to keep them awake. Some say they were doused with freezing water in the winter."    CIA detention   Before the U.S. military was imprisoning and interrogating people in Afghanistan and Iraq, the CIA was scooping up suspected al Qaeda leaders in such far-off places as Pakistan, Yemen and Sudan. Today, the CIA probably holds two to three dozen captives around the world, according to knowledgeable current and former officials. Among them are al Qaeda leaders Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh in Pakistan and Abu Zubaida. The CIA is also in charge of interrogating Saddam Hussein, who is believed to be in Baghdad.  The location of CIA interrogation centers is so sensitive that even the four leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees, who are briefed on all covert operations, do not know them, congressional sources said. These members are given periodic reports about the captives, but several members said they do not receive information about conditions under which prisoners are held, and members have not insisted on this information. The CIA has told Congress that it does not engage in torture as a tactic of interrogation.  "There's a black hole on certain information such as location, condition under which they are held," said one congressional official who asked not to be named. "They are told it's too sensitive."  In Afghanistan, the CIA used to conduct some interrogations in a cluster of metal shipping containers on Bagram air base protected by three layers of concertina wire. It is unclear whether that center is still open, but the CIA's main interrogation center now appears to be in Kabul, at a location nicknamed "The Pit" by agency and Special Forces operators.   "Prisoner abuse is nothing new," said one military officer who has been working closely with CIA interrogators in Afghanistan. A dozen former and current national security officials interviewed by The Washington Post in 2002, including several who had witnessed interrogations, defended the use of stressful interrogation tactics and the use of violence against detainees as just and necessary.   The CIA general counsel's office developed a new set of interrogation rules of engagement in after the Sept. 11 attacks. It was vetted by the Justice Department and approved by the National Security Council's general counsel, according to U.S. intelligence officials and other U.S. officials familiar with the process. "There are very specific guidelines that are thoroughly vetted," said one U.S. official who helps oversee the process. "Everyone is on board. It's legal."  The rules call for field operators to seek approval from Washington to use "enhanced measures," methods that could cause temporary physical or mental pain.  U.S. intelligence officials say the CIA, contrary to the glamorized view from movies and novels, had no real interrogation specialists on hand to deal with the number of valuable suspects it captured after Sept. 11. The agency relied on analysts, psychologists and profilers. "Two and a half years later," one CIA veteran said, "we have put together a very professional, controlled, deliberate and legally rationalized approach to dealing with the Abu Zubaidas of the world."  U.S. intelligence officials say their strongest suit is not harsh interrogation techniques, but time and patience.     'Renditions'   Much larger than the group of prisoners held by the CIA are those who have been captured and transported around the world by the CIA and other agencies of the U.S. government for interrogation by foreign intelligence services. This transnational transfer of people is a key tactic in U.S. counterterrorism operations on five continents, one that often raises the ire of foreign publics when individual cases come to light.  For example, on Jan. 17, 2000, a few hours before Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber was to order the release of five Algerians and a Yemeni for lack of evidence, Bosnian police handed them over to U.S. authorities who flew them to Guantanamo Bay.  The Bosnian government, faced with public outcry, said it would compensate the families of the men, who were suspected of having made threats to the U.S. and British embassies in Bosnia.  The same month, in Indonesia, Muhammad Saad Iqbal Madni, suspected of helping Richard C. Reid, the Briton charged with trying to detonate explosives in his shoe on an American Airlines flight, was detained by Indonesian intelligence agents based on information the CIA provided them. On Jan. 11, without a court hearing or a lawyer, he was hustled aboard an unmarked U.S.-registered Gulfstream V jet parked at a military airport in Jakarta and flown to Egypt.  It was no coincidence Madni ended up in Egypt. Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are well-known destinations for suspected terrorists.  "A lot of people they [the U.S.] are taking to Jordan, third-country nationals," a senior Saudi official said. "They can do anything they want with them, and the U.S. can say, 'We don't have them.' "  In the past year, an unusual country joined that list of destinations: Syria.  Last year U.S. immigration authorities, with the approval of then-Acting Attorney General Larry Thompson, authorized the expedited removal of Maher Arar to Syria, a country the U.S. government has long condemned as a chronic human-rights abuser. Maher, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, was detained at JFK International Airport in New York as he was transferring to the final leg of his flight home to Canada.  U.S. authorities say Arar has links to al Qaeda. Not wanting to return him to Canada for fear he would not be adequately followed, immigration officials took him, in chains and shackles, to a New Jersey airfield, where he was "placed on a small private jet, and flown to Washington D.C.," according to a lawsuit filed recently against the U.S. government. He was flown to Jordan, interrogated and beaten by Jordanian authorities who then turned him over to Syria, according to the lawsuit.  Arar said that for the 10 months he was in prison, he was beaten, tortured and kept in a shallow grave. After much pressure from the Canadian government and human rights activists, he was freed and has returned to Canada.  CIA Director George J. Tenet, testifying earlier this year before the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, said the agency participated in more than 70 renditions in the years before the attacks. In 1999 and 2000 alone, congressional testimony shows, the CIA and FBI participated in two dozen renditions.  Christopher Kojm, a former State Department intelligence official and a staff member of the commission, explained the rendition procedure at a recent hearing: "If a terrorist suspect is outside of the United States, the CIA helps to catch and send him to the United States or a third country," he testified. "Though the FBI is often part of the process, the CIA is usually the main player, building and defining the relationships with the foreign government intelligence agencies and internal security services."  The Saudis currently are detaining and interrogating about 800 terrorism suspects, said a senior Saudi official. Their fate is largely controlled by Saudi-based joint intelligence task forces, whose members include officers from the CIA, FBI and other U.S. law-enforcement agencies.  The Saudi official said his country does not participate in renditions and today holds no more than one or two people at the request of the United States. Yet much can hinge on terminology.  In some interrogations, for example, specialists from the United States and Saudi Arabia develop questions and an interrogation strategy before questioning begins, according to one person knowledgeable about the process. During interrogation, U.S. task force members watch through a two-way mirror, he said.  "Technically, the questioning is done by a Saudi citizen. But, for all practical purposes, it is done live," he said. The United States and Saudis "are not 'cooperating' anymore; we're doing it together."  He said the CIA sometimes prefers Saudi interrogation sites and other places in the Arab world because their interrogators speak a detainee's language and can exploit his religion and customs.  "As hard as it is to believe, you can't physically abuse prisoners in Saudi Arabia," the Saudi official said. "You can't beat them; you can't electrocute them."  Instead, he said, the Saudis bring radical imams to the sessions to build a rapport with detainees, who are later passed on to more moderate imams. Working in tandem with relatives of the detainees, the clerics try to convince the subjects over days or weeks that terrorism violates tenets of the Koran and could bar them from heaven.  "According to our guys, almost all of them turn," the Saudi official, said. "It's like deprogramming them. There is absolutely no need to put them through stress. It's more of a therapy."  The Saudis don't want or need to be directed by American intelligence specialists, who have difficulty understanding Arab culture and tribal relations, he said. "We know where they grew up," he said of the detainees. "We know their families. We know the furniture in their home."   Research editor  Margot Williams  contributed to this report.

But the settlement doesn't really do that - other WorldCom litigation is still pending - and it shouldn't, as the deal is part of Wall Street's reckoning of recent wrongs, which is ongoing.   The size of the payout is staggering not because it is the second-largest class action settlement in history, but because it dwarfs the $1.4 billion settlement agreed to by Citigroup's (nyse: C) Salomon unit and the rest of Wall Street last year.   That settlement, which concerned conflicts of interest by stock analysts, now seems like a down payment. Wall Street still faces analyst-related litigation and lawsuits about the spinning and laddering of IPO shares.  These actions fester despite some of the cases against Henry Blodget and Merrill Lynch (nyse: MER) being dismissed and despite Credit Suisse Group's (nyse: CSR) settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission concerning IPO allocations. Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase (nyse: JPM) and other big banks have settled some Enron-related cases, but more are outstanding.    Citigroup has been denying wrongdoing in relation to WorldCom for a while now, and it admitted no wrongdoing yesterday. It denied that its star telecom analyst Jack Grubman was conflicted by his relationship with former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers and his closeness to WorldCom. Citigroup denied it could have known about accounting fraud at WorldCom despite its close relationship with the company. It denied that its then-CEO Sandy Weill did anything wrong when he lobbied Grubman to change one of his ratings on AT&T (nyse: T). It denied that it did anything wrong when it doled out shares of other companies' IPOs to WorldCom executives.   Yesterday, Citigroup's current CEO Charles Prince took the opportunity of the bank agreeing to pay the $2.65 billion to praise Weill for his leadership in reforming Citigroup. But if Weill is to be so praised, shouldn't he have first been denounced for presiding over the structures that led to the conflicts of interest and the litigation in the first place?  That's not how it works, of course. This type of incentive system mirrors that in corporate America in general. Weill is a prime example. In 2000 alone, he cashed in stock options worth $196.2 million on top of a bonus of $18.4 million. Of course, as is often said, those stock options would not have been worth so much had the value of Citigroup shares not increased.   But soon after, the price of the bank's shares started to fall (along with the market in general). Weill was not called on to pay anything back. Unlike Grubman, he was never fined nor censured.   Now the system is, in a way, working in reverse. Citigroup will pay out far more than it ever earned directly from investment banking fees from WorldCom. What once looked like a world of big rewards and no risk is now all risk and no reward. Not for those who were involved, but for those who own Citigroup shares today.

        HIGHLIGHTS    Security – U.S.A.    Even With Hindsight Liberals Can't See Straight  Over in the alternative universe of the 9/11 commission hearings watched only by me, Richard Ben-Veniste recently proposed an amazing new standard for investigating Arabs in this country. In the middle of haranguing Condoleezza Rice, Ben-Veniste demanded to know why the suspected 20th hijacker, Zacarias Moussaoui, had not been more aggressively investigated, despite the fact that - I quote - he had "no explanation for the funds in his bank account, and no explanation for why he was in the United States."   So let me get this straight: Airport security can't acknowledge that a person is an Arab, but they should be allowed to audit his bank records? (Come to think of it, "Can't Explain His Bank Account or Why He's Here" is also a pretty good description of John Kerry.)    Can we use that as a standard going forward? The government prohibits airlines from searching more than two Arabs per flight, so it would be terrific if liberals would let us examine their bank accounts. If Democratic Party shills like Ben-Veniste - who himself looks like someone who ought to be searched at airports - are going to make ludicrous, macho statements like that in order to win applause from weeping widows in the peanut gallery, can't we hold them to that policy when it matters?   Ben-Veniste thinks the key to stopping the 9/11 attack was for the FBI to have drawn the obvious conclusions from an Arab in flight school. If only the FBI had searched Moussaoui's computer, they would have found a flight-simulator computer program, information about the Boeing 747, and extensive files on crop dusters. From this, apparently, Ben-Veniste imagines the FBI would have drawn the obvious conclusion that on Sept. 11, 19 Muslims were going to hijack airplanes out of Logan, Newark and Dulles airports and fly them into buildings.   A somewhat more direct chain of causation traces its way back to the aviation-security commission chaired by Vice President Al Gore in 1997. If that commission had done its job, you wouldn't have to wait for one of my columns to find out that there was a commission on airline safety years before the 9/11 attacks. Isn't it curious that Democrats aren't bragging about Gore inventing air safety? The reason Al Gore hasn't added "anti-terrorism" to the list of things he invented is that Gore's commission concluded that passenger profiling must ignore ethnicity and nationality. Or as Gore himself might have put it, "I took the initiative in making it easier for Muslims to use airplanes to slaughter innocent American citizens."   The Gore commission on air safety decided that profiling should be based on "reasonable predictors of risk, not stereotypes or generalizations." Amazingly, all those "reasonable predictors of risk" failed to stop a single Muslim terrorist on 9/11. One wonders whether a profiling system that included ethnicity and nationality would have been more helpful in stopping 19 Muslim men, 15 of whom were from Saudi Arabia, all speaking Arabic to one another, from boarding planes on Sept. 11.   Recently - i.e., about the time Ben-Veniste was shocked that the FBI hadn't uncovered the 9/11 plot based on the fact that Moussaoui had overstayed his visa - Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Chuck Schumer were clamoring for the release of Ansar Mahmood, a 26-year-old Pakistani immigrant detained in October 2001 after he was observed taking photographs at a water treatment plant in upstate New York. Mahmood later pleaded guilty to committing a felony by giving financial aid to illegal immigrants from Pakistan. Schumer says Mahmood should be permitted to stay in the U.S. because he "was cleared of terrorist links," and he has already served his time for "a non-violent felony." Hillary simply calls Mahmood's detention "disturbing."  Where is Ben-Veniste when we need him? What happened to the "We Don't Know Why He's Here or His Sources of Money" standard for harassing Muslim immigrants? In contrast to Mahmood, Zacarias Moussaoui had committed no felonies; his only apparent offense was to have overstayed his visa. But Ben-Veniste is appalled that the FBI didn't beat Moussaoui for information.   The French had linked Moussaoui to al-Qaida - based largely on the information that he took frequent trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Mahmood's home country. When FBI agents in Minneapolis requested a warrant to search Moussaoui's computer, FBI headquarters wrote back, "We don't know he's a terrorist" - i.e., the argument Schumer is making for Mahmood's release right now.   Liberals always claim to know exactly what to do as soon as it's too late. After Muslims attack with airplanes, they want to investigate flight schools. After Muslims attack with shoe-bombs, they want to investigate shoes. After a Muslim introduces E. coli into New York's water supply, liberals will be enraged that Muslim immigrants taking pictures of New York water treatment plants weren't investigated more aggressively - as soon as they are done blaming Bush for not stopping the attack amid their caterwauling about the detention of Muslim immigrants. Liberals are the only known species whose powers of reasoning are not improved by the benefit of hindsight. Not only are they always fighting the last war, in most cases they're surrendering.

Fears of possible sabotage attacks on oil facilities in the Middle East also helped to keep prices strong. U.S. light crude hit a high of $39.97 a barrel, before easing to trade 27 cents lower at $39.30 a barrel, while London Brent fell 21 cents to $36.51, down from a high of $37.20, which was the highest level since October 1990. U.S. gasoline futures also eased slightly after hitting another record level of $1.3290 a gallon.   Despite the profit-taking dip, analysts predicted $40-a-barrel oil was still imminent.   "I think we're going to have a four in front of the oil price very soon. It's certainly pretty ugly for the oil consumers of the world," said David Thurtell, commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. Middle East supply security concerns, low U.S. gasoline stocks and rampant demand growth in China have driven U.S. crude prices toward the record $41.15 hit in October 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait in the crisis that led to the Gulf War.   "Terrorism fears are causing a permanent risk premium to be built into the market," said independent energy consultant Geoff Pyne.   Traders worry that weekend shootings at a Saudi Arabian petrochemicals plant and attempts a week earlier to bomb Iraq's key Basra oil export terminal might be precursors to a bigger attack on vital oil facilities in the Middle East, which pumps about one-third of global daily crude output.  Tetsu Emori, chief commodities strategist at Mitsui Bussan Futures in Tokyo, forecast that crude was likely to push up to $43-$45 a barrel by mid-year.  "Last year we hit $39.99 before the war, which was largely psychological. Now we need to look at the fundamentals and they are very strong," Emori said. Prices spiked close to $40 during intraday trading in February 2003 as U.S.-led forces prepared to attack Iraq.   Summer U.S. gasoline consumption is at the cutting edge of rising consumption. U.S. refineries are struggling to meet demand that in the past four weeks rose 3.4 percent versus the same period last year to 9.1 million barrels a day, suppressing stocks of the motor fuel well below the five-year seasonal average.   The United States, with less than five percent of the world's population, accounts for some 45 percent of the world's gasoline consumption of just over 20 million barrels daily, U.S. government figures show. While U.S. motorists are paying a record $1.84 a gallon, retail prices are only a third of average western European levels and have had no impact on demand.

He decried Disney’s decision not to distribute the film as politically motivate censorship.  However, Moore was crying wolf. He admitted in a CNN interview that he knew a year ago that Disney would not distribute the film, according to a report from independent.co.uk.    Moore told CNN, "Almost a year ago, after we'd started making the film, the chairman of Disney, Michael Eisner, told my agent he was upset Miramax had made the film and he will not distribute it."   The lightning rod film producer claims that he had a contract with Disney for distribution, but according to independent.co.uk, a source close to Miramax (the subsidiary involved in the film) said that the deal was for financing, not for distribution.    Moore’s admission prompts the question, why all the outrage now? Easy answer? Publicity baby! The film is set to premier at the Cannes Film Festival later this month. The politically charged film can easily generate controversy and press on it’s own. It is reportedly an attack film against the Bush administration that questions the President’s handling of the War on Terror and the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks. According to some news outlets, the film even attempts to link the Bush family with the family of Osama Bin Laden, in pure Michael Moore style.     This publicity stunt may backfire. If Moore will take a year old event and use it to drum up publicity, it might lead to questions regarding the credibility of some of the issues covered in his film and the spin Moore puts on them.

Bush term if the President wins re-election in November. In classic Powell style, he does not deliver the message in person. Instead, confidants, notably his deputy Richard Armitage and his chief of staff Larry Wilkerson, have made his feelings plain in a lengthy article in the magazine  urlLink GQ , clearly with the Secretary of State's blessing.   …Mr. Wilkerson tells GQ that in his opinion, Gen. Powell is "tired. Mentally and physically. And if the President were to ask him to stay on, he might for a transitional period but I don't think he'd want to do another four years." Gen Powell's sole on-the-record comment to GQ on his intentions is a bald "I never speculate on that". But the article will fuel uncertainty about the Cabinet's shape in a second Bush administration. Changes are likely at the Pentagon. The most widely mentioned possible successors at the State Department include Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's national security adviser, and Paul Bremer, the outgoing head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad. The Powell who emerges from the interview is similar to the figure in journalist Bob Woodward's recent insider account of the run-up to the Iraq War (of which he sxeerms to have been a prime, but as usual unquoted, source). He comes across as a pragmatic secretary of state exhausted by constant battles with the neo-conservative hawks at the Pentagon and in the vice-President's office, in which, over Iraq at least, he is generally on the losing end. Equally plain is the Secretary of State's disdain for the so-called "chickenhawks," in Mr Wilkerson's words, "people who have never been in the face of battle, who are making cavalier decisions about sending men and women out to die." The chief of staff mentions by name Richard Perle, the former close adviser to the Pentagon, and Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy Secretary of Defense. "I call them utopians.. I don't care whether utopians are Vladimir Lenin in a sealed train or Paul Wolfowitz. You're never going to bring utopia and you're going to hurt a lot of people in the process of trying to do it."Gen. Powell also appears to be haunted by the moment that is the nadir of his tenure, his presentation to the United Nations Security Council in February 2003, offering "proof" of Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction. It's a source of great distress to the Secretary; Mr. Armitage told GQ.Mr Wilkerson evokes the atmosphere in the CIA meeting room in the days before the UN speech, when Gen. Powell and his aides worked around the clock to try and make a credible WMD case against Iraq, scouring the evidence for material that would save the Secretary of  State from humiliation. Harlan Ullman of the National War College, and friend and mentor of Gen Powell, confirms another open secret in Washington, of the Secretary's glacial relations with Dick Cheney, the vice-President. "I can tell you firsthand that there is a tremendous barrier between Cheney and Powell," Mr Ullman told the magazine. Assuming he does leave, Gen. Powell's future is unclear. At 67, he is in the closing stages of his career. There have been suggestions he might become the next President of the World Bank, a post traditionally held by an American. This assumes that John Wolfensohn, a Clinton era appointee, steps down later this year after eight years. But Gen. Powell might not be inclined to take a job that carries little clout with the current Republican administration, prone to see the Bank as an emanation of the ever suspect United Nations.

At the same time the organization regrets that the government has failed to take this opportunity to fully acknowledge the crisis in mental health care services, one of the most tragic human rights issues facing Romania today. Amnesty International also regrets the government's failure to engage in a constructive dialogue with the organization and the Romanian civil society, as a first step to remedying the situation.  In the last 15 years, successive Romanian governments failed to recognize the gravity of the situation in mental health care services and to introduce the required comprehensive and effective reforms. Without recognizing the true dimensions and all aspects of the problem it is impossible to expect that a tragic situation which concerns thousands of human beings held in psychiatric institutions in deplorable conditions is addressed urgently and appropriately and in line with all of Romania's obligations under international human rights treaties. The government is not simply in violation of international and domestic law. In light of the human suffering, which takes place in these institutions, recognized by most Romanians who are well informed about this situation, the morality of a position that denies reality is highly questionable.  Amnesty International would also like to reply to specific points raised in the government's press release. The reply notes that currently Romania is unable to provide mental health services which are like those available in the West. Nevertheless, the Romanian authorities, according to the statement, have taken required measures to ensure the respect of basic rights and elemental needs of people who had been subjected to in-patient psychiatric treatment.  In light of numerous violations documented in our memorandum, based primarily on information collected in the field by Amnesty International's delegate, the organization would appreciate to receive specific information regarding the above-mentioned government measures. We would particularly like to receive information on existing standards regarding living conditions, diet, heating and hygiene, which are in force for institutions under the control of the Ministry of Health; as well as information about institutional methods to ensure that such standards are complied with in all facilities providing inpatient services.  It is also alleged that not all of the information presented in Amnesty International's memorandum is true, giving as an example the fact that representatives of the Ministry of Health and public prosecutors periodically visit medical facilities, including those where patients are subjected to involuntary psychiatric treatment.  No statement to the contrary was made in Amnesty International's memorandum. In fact, the memorandum did not specifically reflect on the government's obligation to supervise psychiatric hospitals. This is an opportunity then to put on record Amnesty International's observation regarding this issue: the organization's field research established that the government's supervision of the psychiatric hospitals is insufficient and in breach of international standards (1). For example, in a number of instances, hospital directors were unable to produce for Amnesty International's delegate copies of reports of any recent inspection visits. Presumably, such documents would arise following an inspection by the Ministry's representatives, and would contain their observations, any recommendations made and advice on terms and methods of their implementation.  Furthermore, Amnesty International is concerned to note in the Government's statement that the inspections, so far, have not brought to light any irregularities with regard to the placement of people for involuntary psychiatric treatment and that a list of patients' rights is prominently posted in the visited facilities. Such lists were not observed in locked words visited by Amnesty International's delegate where interviewed patients had been subjected to treatment without being given the opportunity to effectively challenge this decision as provided in the Mental Health Act (2). Moreover, Amnesty International is aware of the public prosecutor's duty to periodically visit hospitals, which care for people who are deemed criminally irresponsible under the provisions of the Penal Code. In that respect it is interesting to note that a senior prosecutor who participated in a debate concerning conditions in psychiatric hospitals organized in Bucharest in late March 2004 by the Group for Social Dialogue, reportedly stated that the living conditions in Poiana Mare were considerably worse than in any prison and that placement for involuntary treatment in this hospital amounts to "being sentenced to death".  The government's statement also challenges Amnesty International's observation that the Mental Health Act is not being implemented because the government had failed to adopt regulations for its implementation.  Almost all of the directors of the hospitals visited and medical and legal specialists who had been consulted in Romania by Amnesty International's delegate, including a member of the team of experts who participated in the drafting of the law, stated unequivocally that the Act is not directly applicable. An exception, as stated in Amnesty International's memorandum, was only noted in a hospital in Bihor County but this effort, although well intentioned, did not appear to provide all the required legal safeguards to the patients concerned. Amnesty International would welcome to receive detailed information about the direct implementation of the law and specific instances in which decisions have been challenged before judicial bodies, noting that any such practice may only be sporadic and inconsistently applied. The very fact that this is not a practice that is systematically ensured throughout the country indicates its arbitrary nature and is in violation of international law.  With regard to the so-called "social cases" - people who had been placed in psychiatric hospitals on non-medical grounds, including those who had formerly been cared for in children's institutions - the government's statement claims that such cases are not numerous and result from the situation which prevailed in the country before the changes in 1989.  Amnesty International would like to receive more information from the Romanian government regarding the basis for this assessment of the situation. On 5 May 2004, a day following the publication of the Government's statement, the State Secretary in the Ministry of Health, according to a report published the same day by BBC-Romanian Service, could not provide journalists at a press conference with any figures concerning the number of people who are held in psychiatric hospitals on non-medical grounds. However, he gave an example of the psychiatric hospital in Jebel where 60 residents, out of a total of 414, were "social cases". In one of the hospitals visited by Amnesty International's representative, according to the director, 40-50 residents, none of whom need psychiatric treatment, out of a total of 450 in this institution, had been transferred there from a near-by orphanage. In the medical-social centre of the Nucet Psychiatric hospital which has about 95 residents, most of whom had previously been in orphanages, in February 2004, when Amnesty International's delegate visited the hospital, the latest resident from an orphanage had arrived on 1 December 2003.  Amnesty International is concerned to note that the Government considers its description of the situation in "Socola" Psychiatric University Hospital in Iasi as erroneous. In support of this claim it is noted that "the management of this hospital had confirmed that Amnesty International's experts did not visit this facility in May 2003". Furthermore, the government stated that the registry of received funds by the hospital in the indicated period showed that the hospital was not in a difficult situation and that its activities were carried out in normal conditions.  In the organization's memorandum there is a clear designation of institutions visited by its representative as well as the date of the visits. Amnesty International has made no claim to have visited the hospital in Iasi and had described its situation based on a report in a national daily newspaper. This information, to our best knowledge, had not been refuted at the time by the hospital or other authorities involved (4). In fact the same article quoted Dr Stefan Georgescu, Chief of Iasi Directorate for Public Health, who reportedly stated: "Because of the debts that exist in the system "Socola" hospital has problems in obtaining supplies. Psychiatry is seriously underfunded. For example, Intensive Care Therapy is allocated several million lei per day while for a bed in psychiatry we receive only 300.000 lei. We cannot manage on such modest sums."(5)  The government statement further notes that the budget of the Ministry of Health provides not only for conventional therapies but also for other appropriate therapies.  Amnesty International has noted the inadequacy of some forms of therapy, such as pharmacotherapy, and the absence of a wide range of other therapies in practically all of the institutions visited. We would be interested to receive specific information regarding the volume of such funds and its precise allocation to psychiatric hospitals in 2003. The organization is concerned that the Government is failing to acknowledge what every psychiatrist who had been interviewed by Amnesty International's delegate had stated: that allocated resources even for pharmacotherapy were grossly insufficient and that they feared further cuts. Some doctors were forced to resort to collecting donations from the staff in order to purchase the required medication, while others relied on gifts and aid from their foreign colleagues.  Similarly, Amnesty International's findings do not correspond with the government's observations regarding methods of restraint and seclusion or that patients are provided with all the information in appropriate circumstances to be able to exercise their right to free and informed consent.  Finally, with regard to the cases described in the memorandum, concerning patients who died following an assault by another patient, Amnesty International concurred with the observations of competent authorities, which issued statements at the time that understaffing was a major contributing factor to the reported tragic events.  Amnesty International welcomes the government's statement that it will thoroughly investigate the violations of human rights described in the organization's memorandum. We also welcome a statement of 5 May 2004 by the Ministry of Health as a positive first step to improve the situation in psychiatric facilities for which it is responsible. At the same time, Amnesty International would like to reiterate its appeal to the Romanian government to fully implement all the recommendations made in the organization's memorandum. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  (1)  See Principle 22 of the UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care which states that: "States shall ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in force to promote compliance with the present principles, for the inspection of mental health facilities, for the submission, investigation and resolution of complaints and for the institution of appropriate disciplinary or judicial proceedings for professional misconduct or violation of the rights of a patient".

The two communities, while both Iraqi, have diverging interests on a number of issues due to the history of their religious differences. For a variety of reasons, Washington decided that its interests would be best served by tipping the balance of power between these two groups in favor of Shi'a interests.    - Washington's Motivations Behind Supporting Iraqi Shi'a    Shi'a Arabs are the majority cultural group in Iraq, composing about 60 percent of the population. Since the Shi'a are a majority, their support is absolutely critical in order to keep a general level of stability in the country.  Furthermore, before the start of the invasion, Washington policymakers believed the Shi'a population to be an easy group to win the "hearts and minds" of. The Shi'a community was harshly repressed under Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist government and were occasionally the recipients of brutal crackdowns due to their open resistance to Baghdad's rule, as was seen in the wake up Operation Desert Storm in 1991 when Iraqi troops loyal to Saddam forcefully quelled a Shi'a uprising that began due to the power vacuum created after the retreat of the Iraqi military from Kuwait, and also due to the first Bush administration's call for them to rise up.  Additionally, there was also the effort by Washington policymakers to marginalize Iraq's Sunni Arab population since they were the traditional power base behind the Ba'ath Party. Often the recipients of special favors by Saddam's government in Baghdad, Iraq's Sunni Arab population was more privileged than the country's other major cultural groups, such as Sunni Kurds and Shi'a Arabs. For these reasons, the Bush administration decided that its best course of action would be to push this population off to the sidelines and deal with the victims of the Ba'ath Party's brutality since it would be likely that they would be more open to supporting the U.S. and therefore more beholden to U.S. interests.  Therefore, shortly after the invasion, it is likely that the guerrilla movement in Iraq was exactly as Washington claimed: disenfranchised Sunni Arab militants who were taking up arms against U.S.-led forces. Yet as the occupation continued on, and Washington was unable to achieve relative stability in the country, it became clear that it was not only Sunni Arabs that were taking up arms against U.S.-led forces. This development was evident by the various tapes sent to Arab news networks, such as al-Jazeera, by Iraqi insurgents; in the videos, various militants expressed their hatred for Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party in addition to their hatred for the U.S.-led coalition.  As the occupation proceeded, and the level of stability in Iraq did not improve, the insurgency became more and more diversified, as attacks were launched against U.S.-led troops, Kurds in the north, Sunni Arabs, and Shi'a Arabs. During this time, various groups in Iraq were taking advantage of the power vacuum created after the fall of Saddam to weaken the power base of their enemies or ideological opponents -- indeed, not only is it possible that Sunni and Shi'a Arabs were killing each other, but, as the U.S. alleges, Shi'a leaders may have been assassinating other Shi'a leaders.    - Fallout with the Shi'a    This state of affairs continued for months, with the Shi'a community largely remaining docile in the hopes that true democracy in Iraq would be achieved, thus guaranteeing their ascension as the majority powerbrokers in any new government. Washington, worried over the possibility of too much Shi'a control, began to backtrack slightly on its promise of national elections, and attempted to work certain balancing constraints into the interim constitution. These constraints attempted to equalize the power between Sunni Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shi'a Arabs.  Angered by the change in U.S. policy, Shi'a leaders began to become more outspoken toward the U.S.-led coalition, with both more radical leaders, such as Moqtada al-Sadr, and more moderate leaders, such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, speaking with a unified voice over their disapproval of Washington's plans.  This increasing anger caused the Shi'a community to move away from outspoken support of U.S. policies, and also paved the way for more radical Shi'a leaders such as al-Sadr to increase the size of their following. Al-Sadr, whose power rests upon his Mehdi Army, a private militia containing thousands of fighters, heightened his rhetoric against the U.S.-led coalition to the point that Washington policymakers decided to punish him, closing down his al-Hawza newspaper and arresting one of his top deputies on a murder charge.  Al-Sadr's rebellion, which may have initially been supported by a small minority of Shi'a, had a unifying effect upon the Shi'a community, as Washington's open confrontation with Mehdi fighters put Iraqis in the position of either supporting one side or the other. As in all cases of occupation, the local population generally always supports those that share their culture and history over foreign occupiers, no matter either side's ultimate intentions. Indeed, this was partly the reason why other more moderate Shi'a leaders, such as al-Sistani, have been careful to criticize al-Sadr and have, in effect, offered him safe haven in Najaf.    - More Balance Needed    After witnessing the explosive power of the Shi'a community, Washington policymakers came to the understanding that they would not be able to revive Iraq through the support of Shi'a Arabs and Kurds alone; Iraq's Sunni Arab population would have to be better incorporated into the government. Faced with an insurgency encompassing both Shi'a and Sunni Arabs, Washington has now attempted to remove some of the grievances behind the insurgency.  Also, because Iraq's Sunni Arab population was favored by Saddam, they were often the most educated and skilled Iraqis, a reality that has hurt Washington since it has excluded these pertinent individuals from government and societal affairs. Recognizing their mistake, Washington has now reversed its de-Ba'athification policy and is actively reincorporating former Sunni Arabs, who worked with the Ba'ath Party, into positions of influence.  The threat of Shi'a rebellion also forced Washington to draft a better solution to the continuing problem of Sunni militants. While before the Shi'a rebellion Washington had enough troop power to spar with these militants, faced with an insurgency encompassing two of Iraq's three main cultural groups, Washington quickly discovered that it did not have the troop force to fight so many different enemies at once. Now, in an effort to alleviate this danger, Washington has recruited former Ba'athist generals and placed them in positions of military power. By giving many former soldiers their jobs back, Washington hopes to eliminate much of the fodder that is impelling Sunni militants to attack U.S.-led troops.  Of course, this balancing act is difficult to maintain. As Washington helps Sunni Arabs achieve their interests, it risks upsetting Iraqi Shi'a, thus throwing off the balance once again. For this balancing act to be successful, Washington has to be very attuned to the concerns of all groups involved in Iraqi affairs and be able to rapidly shift its strategy in light of new political shifts and developments. Failure to do so will mean that inevitably Washington will be unable to sustain its balancing act; should this occur, a debilitating situation on the ground will likely erupt.

        HIGHLIGHTS    Legal - Security   Lawmakers fear railroads are 'softtarget' for terror   Lawmakers yesterday questioned whether the federal government overlooked terrorism risks to passenger and freight railroads as it responded to the September 11 attacks.     "Our enemies seek a soft target," Rep. Jon Porter, Nevada Republican, said during a congressional hearing.     The House Transportation and Infrastructure railroads subcommittee is investigating ways to avert attacks such as the March 11 Madrid train bombings that killed 191 persons.     The lawmakers asked the Bush administration to deliver a written plan for responding to terrorist threats against railroads.     The hearing coincides with other federal government efforts to catch up on railroad security after spending $11 billion on aviation security.     The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on Tuesday began a 30-day test at the New Carrollton train station to determine the feasibility of screening Amtrak and commuter rail passengers for bombs.     In addition, a Senate committee last month approved a bill that would spend $3.2 billion on railroad and port security.     Members of the Bush administration said yesterday their precautions against terrorist attacks on railroads focus largely on gathering intelligence reports and developing response strategies.     Chet Lunner, TSA assistant administrator, said the federal government should not concentrate security efforts too heavily on a single transportation mode.     "Without consistent application of reasonable and prudent security measures across modes, we risk creating weak links that may drive terrorism from one mode to another," he said.     Mr. Lunner was uncertain whether the security checkpoints being tested at the New Carrollton station would be practical when large numbers of commuters are trying to board a train.     "That's exactly the kind of question we're trying to answer," he said.     Allan Rutter, the departing head of the Federal Railroad Administration, said the railroad industry is developing a variety of terrorism risk precautions, including greater use of bomb-sniffing dogs, rail cars manufactured to withstand crashes and risk assessments of hazardous materials shipments.     However, he also suggested that Congress avoid heavy regulation of the railroad industry, saying a better option is "a balance between security and economic liberty."     Last year, the TSA opened a Transportation Security Operations Center to coordinate intelligence reports of threats with responses by law enforcement and the transportation industry, including railroads.     Since the September 11 attacks, Congress has spent about $115 million on mass-transit security.     In addition, Amtrak received about $100 million to harden its tunnels against bomb blasts. States and cities have the discretion to use some federal transportation funding for rail security but are not required to do so.     "I think it is time to switch our priorities," said Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who is the District's nonvoting member of Congress.

Pakistan has said Abdul Qadeer Khan, a top nuclear scientist revered at home as the father of its atomic bomb, had smuggled nuclear secrets to North Korea, Iran and Libya.   The scandal raised fears that weapons of mass destruction could reach the hands of militants bent on terror attacks as well as what Washington has called "rogue" states.   The Pakistani government said the cabinet had adopted the draft bill on export controls.   "The draft bill manifests Pakistan's strong commitment to the prevention of proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons and missiles capable of delivering such weapons," it said.   The statement referred to last week's U.N. resolution mandating countries to strengthen controls over sensitive technology and material related to weapons of mass destruction.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said the legislation, which parliament is expected to pass soon, had been under consideration for four years.   "This is big news for us," he said.   Officials said the bill envisaged severe punishment for anyone found leaking nuclear technology or hardware, although this did not apply retroactively to A.Q. Khan.   Khan, who made a televised apology for his role in the proliferation scandal in February, is closely guarded at his home in Islamabad, although authorities deny he is under house arrest.   President Pervez Musharraf pardoned the popular scientist, who said he and a few associates acted alone. Western diplomats and analysts argue that he could not have acted without support from the powerful military.   International criticism of Musharraf for the scandal and of his decision to pardon A.Q. Khan was muted, perhaps in recognition of his key role in the U.S.-led war on terror.   But Pakistan has been under quiet, yet constant pressure to strengthen safeguards surrounding its nuclear weapons program.   Pakistan vowed to develop the nuclear bomb after rival India exploded its first nuclear device in 1974 and conducted five tests weeks after India carried out its own tests in May 1998.   Defense experts say Pakistan has about 25 nuclear warheads and India about 50, although estimates vary widely on the size of the secret arsenals.

He stopped short of apologizing.    "There will be investigations. People will be brought to justice,"  Bush said in a television interview that was aired in Cairo late Wednesday afternoon.  In the first of two planned interviews, the president did not specifically apologize for the mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.   But, he said,  "The actions of these few people do not reflect the hearts of the American people."    "The American people are just as appalled" as Iraqis, Bush said, over images broadcast around the world of naked detainees and gloating U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib, a notorious prison during Saddam Hussein's regime that was taken over by U.S. troops.    "People in Iraq must understand that I view those practices as abhorrent. They must also understand that what took place in that prison does not represent the America that I know,"  Bush said.   "The America I know is a compassionate country that believes in freedom. The America I know cares about every individual. The America I know has sent troops into Iraq to promote freedom, good honorable citizens that are helping Iraqis everyday," he said.   Bush said he retained confidence in Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and told him earlier Wednesday to "find the truth and tell the Iraqi people and the world the truth. We have nothing to hide."   Bush's appearance on Arab television came the day after the Army disclosed that it is conducting criminal investigations of 10 prisoner deaths in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan, plus another 10 abuse cases.   In addition, the deaths of two Iraqi prisoners already have been ruled homicides. In one case, a soldier was court-martialed, reduced in rank and discharged from the Army. In the other homicide, a CIA contract interrogator's conduct has been referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Bush said the U.S. inquiry would look into whether such instances of abuse also took place in other prisons. "We want to know the truth," Bush said.   Bush said it was important for "the people of Iraq to know that everything is not perfect. Those mistakes are made. But in a democracy, as well, those mistakes will be investigated, and people will be brought to justice."   Administration officials have tried to assure the American public and the world that the abuse of prisoners at the prison was an aberration, and that guilty parties would be dealt with swiftly and firmly.   Bush said that the United States would cooperate with the International Red Cross.  Asked about the United States' practice of pointing out abuses of human rights in other countries, he said, "We ... say to those governments, `Clean up your act.' And that's precisely what America is doing."  The first Bush interview to air was with Al-Hurra, a U.S.-government funded Arabic-language station.  Al-Hurra is generally viewed in the region as propaganda. Another interview with Bush was expected to air later on Al-Arabiya television, a satellite channel based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that is popular around the Arab world.  The disclosure of the prisoner abuse, condemned throughout the world, came just two months before the United States is to turn over civilian authority to a new Iraqi interim government.  Bush said the U.S.-led coalition's decision to transfer security duties in the volatile city of Fallujah to an Iraqi battalion led by one of Saddam's former military leaders should not be a message to the Iraqi people that the United States was lowering its expectations for freedom in Iraq. "Quite the contrary," Bush said. "We're raising expectations."  Bush expressed continued confidence that a peaceful Palestinian state can emerge from the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is working on ways to revive his Gaza withdrawal plan after his own Likud Party overwhelmingly rejected the proposal in a nonbinding referendum.  While Bush's support for Sharon's territorial plans was condemned in the Arab world, Bush said, "I felt that a withdrawal from the Gaza by the Israeli prime minister as well as the withdrawal from four settlements from the West Bank by the Israeli prime minister was a step toward peace."

In the Arab version, dozens of cameras record the actions of 12 participants from various Arab countries who share an apartment. The program was filmed in Bahrain's Amwaj Islands, largely because of the help Bahrain gave to get it on the air and because of the islands' convenient location. (1)    The airing of the first episode sparked a stormy public discussion in Bahrain. Conservative circles organized mass demonstrations demanding that the broadcasts be immediately halted because of their damage to Islamic values. In contrast, liberal circles and Bahraini businessmen supported the broadcasts because of their contribution to Bahrain's economy.   Recently, Sheikh Yousef Al-Qaradhawi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader and a leading authority in Sunni Islam, discussed reality-TV programs, saying: "The aim of these programs is to mislead the [Muslim] nation and to keep it from its own reality, so that it will live [in the reality of] these lesser things. Anyone to whom the nation is important must rise up against these deviant trends. There is no doubt that [our] youth are human riches, and represent the future of the nation. We must not abandon these riches or waste them with these imported television programs that do not reflect the character of the nation, do not represent its true image, and are a real invasion."(2)  The following are excerpts of writings both in favor of and opposing the airing of the show:       Con:  The Program Is Against Islamic Values, Part of the West's Takeover Plans  Although MBC claimed that the Arabic version of "Big Brother" was adapted to an Arab audience, the program's detractors insisted that it was against Islamic values. They pointed at the mingling of the sexes, the unveiled faces of the female participants, and the inappropriate behavior of some male participants - such as one boy who kissed a girl on the cheek.   A communiqué issued by the Islamic Al-Minbar Party stated: "This program is nothing but another link in the long chain of media and tourism programs against the religion, values, and morality of this society. [This program] strikes unceasingly at Muslim sentiments in this respectable land... Dozens or hundreds of low-level jobs in tourism and the hotel industry will never justify openness to dubious investments that harm the sons of this homeland more than they help them."(3)  Similar statements were also made by Shu'la Shakib, head of the Association of the Future women's organization, to the London Arabic-language daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat: "We cannot agree to concessions on morals and on matters required by the religion in order to obtain investments."(4)  Following these protests, a program spokesman announced the appointment of a Shari'a advisory committee, headed by Sheikh Mohsen Al-Usfour, a judge in the Supreme Shari'a Court of Appeals in Bahrain's Al-Ja'fariyya district, to monitor the program.5 A few days after he was appointed, Sheikh Usfour announced his resignation from the committee, saying, "It is impossible to maintain Shari'a oversight on a program before perusing its content." His resignation notwithstanding, Sheikh Usfour criticized the opposition to the program, saying: "The mingling [of the sexes] in Bahrain is not limited to the 'Big Brother' program. It is everywhere, in the private schools and in the universities... Our Islamic libraries, in the cities and villages, have many religious books containing satanic Fatwas permitting prostitution, masturbation, watching pornographic movies, the artificial insemination of a woman by a man who is not her husband, a woman being alone with a strange man for purposes of polit ical work, and other things a thousand times more grievous than the 'Big Brother' program... It saddens me to say that some of those who are disseminating these satanic Fatwas are among those opposed to the 'Big Brother' program."(6)  Some saw the program as part of a quiet war waged by the West to corrupt Arab youth. In her column in the Bahraini daily Akhbar Al-Khaleej, Samira Ragab wrote: "The mistake is thinking that the 'Big Brother' program is only a television program that can be handled [merely] by objecting to its airing or filming in Bahrain... [But] it is a media war directed at and planned for the youth, which is targeted in this war strategy. Thus, stimuli and temptations [are directed] at the youth, which perhaps will be unable to absorb them, reject them, or refrain from sinking into them...   "The solutions [to this] are in our hands, and begin within our homes. Educate your sons and daughters to free and logical speech, distant from the burden of traditionalist words within their minds. Let them suckle concepts of nationalism, loyalty, and belonging to this great land and homeland. Let them suckle the concepts of Arab culture that emerged and grew under Islam and illuminated proper Islamic thought, not strict and extreme [Islamic thought]. Your children in your home are the weapons by which you will fight all the impending Tatar and Crusader attacks."(7)  In a similar vein, columnist Fawziyya Rashid also wrote in Akhbar Al-Khaleej: "It is completely obvious, and no secret ... that the American intention is to take over the Middle East... The plans to begin the occupation [of the Middle East] - whether directly via military occupation, as happened in Iraq, or indirectly via the occupation of the hearts and minds of the people - will come about in the framework of the American cultural, media, and political program aimed at changing [the face of] the Middle East, on the pretext of democratization and liberation. This will be done in the framework of a cold war [aimed at] infiltrating the minds [of the Arabs], and particularly the minds of the young adults who, according to recent statistics, make up 70% of the Arab homeland...  "After the occupation of Iraq, this began to take the shape of a cold war based on the American satellite channels, radio stations, and translated publications, and dragging in with it some of the Arab satellite channels to participate in disseminating the ideology and information of some of the American informational and cultural programs. As a result, the satellite channels hover above us [with programs] such as 'Ala Al-Hawa Sawa,'(8) 'Star Akademi,'(9) the 'Al-Hurra [channel],' many radio stations headed by [the American radio station] 'Sawa,' and also the 'Big Brother' program...  "When America invades our homes, our eyes, and our ears so intensively, it is aimed primarily at the Arab youth, which is a large percentage of all Arab countries. The 'declared' goal of this aiming [at the youth] ... is to distribute 'new ideas' and take part in 'mutual understanding and tolerance.' If these changes do not occur by means of [American] media and cultural infiltration, then they will be implemented by force, in order, as a senior White House official recently stated, to preserve American interests.   "In order to instill ideological, emotional, and spiritual change - that is, to infiltrate to within the individual and conquer his mind, the 'Arab Cultural Marines' are prepared for action, in the form of brigades of inspectors and Arab intellectuals who today act as an intellectual, cultural, and political 'line of defense' in the various American wars in the region... [In these wars], the American format is marketed and prettified to camouflage its invasion and occupation, in order [to cause people] to agree to it and in order to preoccupy the minds of the young and of the adults with insipid matters that are distant from the essential and dangerous issues in the Arab arena - issues that are headed by the resistance to the American and the Israeli occupations in the region..."(10)      Pro:  The Program Benefits Bahrain's Economy, And Canceling It Will Damage Bahrain's Image   Businessmen and liberal circles insisted that the program contributed to the Bahraini economy and called not to comply with the demand to halt its broadcast, because of the negative impact this would have on entrepreneurship in Bahrain.   Bahrain Businessmen's Association Chairman Khaled Al-Mu'ayyad said that the association sent its heartfelt thanks to the program's directors for choosing Bahrain as the focus of their investment, and blessed the Bahrain government for providing concessions for the communications company and thus creating new jobs for Bahrain's citizens.(11)    Bahraini MP Ahmad Ibrahim Behzad, who also heads the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and National Security Committee, said of the demand to halt broadcasting: "Canceling the contract between those in charge and the program's initiators will damage the kingdom in general. [The damage] will be not only economic; it will also negatively impact the kingdoms credibility with regard to contracts, agreements, and pacts. It will also negatively impact the investor - whether local or foreign - and will help the flow of funds out of the kingdom..."(12)  Columnist Abd Al-Mun'im Ibrahim wrote in the Bahraini daily Akhbar Al-Khaleej: "It is the people's right to demonstrate and march, but it is not welcome for them to go too far and refrain from investing, to embarrass investors, and to hinder the projects for the economy and development of the country. Where is the voice of reason? Many ask whether, if the 'Big Brother' program had chosen [to film in] Dubai instead of Bahrain, people would prevent their sons from watching the satellite channels, or be resentful because Dubai was hosting the program while we [had failed] to act to host it by ourselves and rake in the profits."(13)  In his column in Akhbar Al-Khaleej, Ali Sayyar published an article sent him by a reader, "Ali 2," in response to his opposition to the "Big Brother" program. The letter said: "One of the advantages of the 'Big Brother' program is that it provided jobs for many Bahraini citizens and no one, in my opinion, has condemned this... Another advantage of the program is that it opened our eyes to the new format of the fascinating television programs that have not existed in our media.   "Yet another advantage is that it demanded high qualifications of its participants, such as broad general knowledge and also an attitude of politeness, etiquette, and cooperation towards others. This in particular is in light of Bahrain's anticipation of the day when its coming generations will be fit to live in [accordance] with their time, and not shut themselves away because of the pressure of negative heritage that cause embarrassment, hesitation, and fear of the other..."(14)       The Decision to Stop the Program     Following the uproar in Bahrain about the program, the administration of MBC decided to stop airing it. In an official communiqué, it said: "The decision came following a request from the communications minister of Bahrain, the country hosting the program. [The decision was made] out of a desire to preserve [Bahrain's] social unity, and out of concern lest MBC constitute a reason for disagreement [in the country]..."(15)  Reactions to this decision were conflicting. Adel Al-Mu'awadah, the second deputy to the Bahraini parliamentary chairman, expressed his joy at the halt of a program "that turned the individual into cheap merchandise bought and sold for $100,000." He said that the decision to move the filming out of Bahrain was "civilized and proper" and that MBC must be "thanked and appreciated for doing the right thing."(16)   In contrast, Khaled Al-Mu'ayyad, chairman of the Bahrain Businessmen's Association, called the decision "regrettable" and expressed his hopes that "those who caused the station to leave Bahrain and film elsewhere would appreciate the resulting damage, loss of funds, and loss of jobs" and that "every group in [Bahraini] society must understand the implications of extremism, excess, and hysteria with regard to certain issues."(17)      Endnotes:   (1)  Al-Itihad (UAE), February 21, 2004.

Also, it must be ascertained that the program is not only an imitation of a Western program." See Al-Sharq Al-Awsat (London), February 28, 2004.   (7)  Akhbar Al-Khaleej (Bahrain), March 1, 2003.

Around 5,600 troops are ready to go to Rio, although there is not yet a final decision on how many will be used in the operation to help out-gunned police in Brazil's second-largest city, a spokeswoman at the defense ministry said. Rio Gov. Rosinha Matheus last month asked Brazil's government for 4,000 troops to help police in Rio's hillside Rocinha slum. Clashes between drug gangs, whose arsenals include rocket launchers, mines and grenades, killed at least 12 people in April. The deployment of the troops would be the first time soldiers have been sent to Brazil's tourist mecca to help in the day-to-day fight against crime rather than to ensure safety during specific events. Troops were sent for the city's 2003 Carnival and for the 2002 presidential election.

Speaking at the launch in Gusau, the state capital, Governor Sani disclosed that time was ripe for full implementation of the programme as enshrined in the Holy Quran. He added that his government would soon embark on demolition of all places of worship of unbelievers in the state, in line with Islamic injunction to fight them wherever they are found.   The governor also disclosed that a law to compel employers of labor in the state to give their employees "prayer breaks" five times daily would soon be enacted by the state House of Assembly.   The governor's stance on the demolition of all non-Islamic worship centres, however, runs contrary to the provisions of the country’s constitution, which states in Chapter 4, Section 38(1) that "every person shall be entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom (either alone or in community with others, and in public or in private) to manifest and propagate his religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice and observance.   Commenting on Governor Sani's decision, a lawyer and Chairman of Somolu Local Government, Barrister Ademorin Kuye, described the move as unconstitutional.    "The governor has no constitutional power to demolish churches in his state. The constitution guarantees the right of worship of every Nigerian. Nigeria is a secular state and a serving governor should not be seen as promoting one religion over the other,"  Barrister Kuye declared.  He warned the Zamfara governor not to embark on destruction of churches, as it would have grave repercussion in other parts of the country.   It would be recalled that Governor Sani introduced the Sharia Legal Code in the state in the year 2000, despite opposition from the federal government and religious groups. The implementation of the system led to the amputation of the wrist of a cow thief, Malam Jangedi. Governor Sani also made the retention of a long beard a condition for securing juicy contracts from the state government.  Source;  Copyright PM News.

Eduardo Ermita, the defence secretary, said in a press briefing that the authorities had begun proceedings to freeze several bank accounts holding a total of $25,000 of funds transferred from suspected JI leader Riduan Islamudin, also known as Hambali, currently under US custody.  It was the first time that Philippine security officials had been able to establish a detailed money trail from international terror suspects to their local partners, he said.  Philippine security officials are on heightened alert amid reports that the JI and local terror groups are planning to sabotage the May 10 presidential election.  Last month, six suspected Muslim militants said to be plotting major bomb attacks on shopping malls and western embassies in Manila were arrested.  The authorities also arrested 46-year old Jordan Mamso Addullah based on leads provided by US officials who interrogated Mr Islamudin, said Hermogenes Ebdane Jr., the Philippine police chief.  He added that according to US intelligence, the $25,000 was transferred in July 2003 and was delivered to JI members by an unknown courier flying in from Kuala Lumpur.  The authorities believe that upon receiving the money, Mr Addullah changed it into local currency and sent half of it to an Indonesian JI cell leader called "Zulkipli". "Zulkipli" was then supposed to have deposited some of it in a bank and gave the rest to a JI bomber known only as "Marwan". Mr Ebdane said the remainder might have been used to finance a safe-house for the JI cell, Mr Addulah's money trading business and the dowry for Zulkipli's fiancee.  Apart from money laundering, Mr Addullah is also facing charges for possible involvement in at least three bombing incidents in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where most of the country's Muslim minority live.

If one were to believe the official version disseminated by Thai officials, civilian as well as military, this is what appears to have happened: Groups of machete-wielding Muslim youth raided nearly 15 village defence and police establishments in an attempt to seize the arms and ammunition kept there. The Thai security forces, who had advance inkling of the planned attacks, were waiting for the attacks when they came, and managed to repulse them.    Thirty-two of the survivors amongst the youth took shelter in a 16th century mosque near Pattani. After a stand-off lasting nearly six hours during which none of them was prepared to surrender, the security forces managed to kill all of them and free the mosque from their control.    Members of a local football team were among the 100 Muslim youngsters killed. About 16 of the attackers were captured. There were less than 10 casualties amongst the security forces.   The tactics adopted by the poorly armed Muslim youth bring to mind more that of the LTTE in the early years of its struggle against the Sri Lankan armed forces or of the Maoists of Nepal or of the tribal insurgents of India's North-East than that of the jihadi terrorists active in the South-East Asian and South Asian region. The LTTE, the Maoists and Indian tribal insurgents used to adopt such tactics to replenish their stocks of arms and ammunition.   What these young Muslims have exhibited in common with their co-religionists in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere is their fierce motivation and not the modus operandi adopted by them. They do not appear to be bandits or narcotics smugglers as projected by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand and his officials. They are politically and religiously motivated fighters, with no evidence so far of any external influence - either from the Jemaah Islamiyah of the South-East Asian region or the jihadi organisations of Pakistan and/or Bangladesh - on their mind.   Attacking in large numbers with machetes is not the known modus operandi of any of the identified jihadi organizations of the International Islamic Front. They do slit the throat of their victims with a knife, just as they slit the throat of a sacrificial goat with one, but they do not indulge in massive attacks on posts of the security forces and the police carrying only machetes.   If the Thai authorities' contention that they had advance information about the raids and had taken up position to repulse the raiders when they came is correct, it is unfortunate that they should have used excessive force against the ill-armed youth instead trying to overpower them or immobilize them by shooting below their knees.   The circumstances surrounding the attack on the mosque in which 32 young Muslims had taken shelter resulting in their death are even murkier. Leaders of the local Muslim community have alleged that no attempt was made by the Thai authorities to persuade the youth with the help of intermediaries from the local Muslim community to surrender.   The fact that despite being out-gunned and out-numbered, the youth chose to die instead of surrendering shows that these were not bandits or narcotics smugglers, but fiercely-motivated youth, who wanted to draw the attention of their co-religionists not only in Southern Thailand, but also in the rest of the Ummah to their anger and desperation.    Just as the raid of the Indian security forces into the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holy place of worship, at Amritsar in India in June 1984, aggravated the problem posed by the Sikh terrorists in Punjab, this raid by the Thai authorities is likely to aggravate the divide between the Muslims and the non-Muslims and the Muslims and the political leadership in Thailand.     There is already a wave of anger in Pakistan and Bangladesh over what is perceived as the deliberate massacre of Muslim youth in southern Thailand by the security forces. The Lashkar-e-Tayiba of Pakistan and the Bangladesh branch of the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami have been projecting southern Thailand as the Fallujah of Thailand.    This anger against the Thai authorities could result in acts of reprisal not only against the Thai leaders and officials in Thailand, but also against Thai nationals and interests outside the country by Harkat and Lashkar.

He succeeds Sir Richard Dearlove as head of the service, and will adopt the moniker 'C', common to all its chiefs.   Mr Scarlett was a relatively obscure figure, little known outside Whitehall, prior to the  urlLink Hutton Inquiry . He was head of the joint intelligence committee, the cabinet office body that prepares intelligence assessments for the government.   He had previously been MI6 station chief in Moscow, and was at one time responsible for handling the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky. He also worked for the service in Paris and Nairobi.   The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said he had made the appointment on the basis of a recommendation by a selection panel chaired by Sir David Omand, Downing Street's security and intelligence co-ordinator.   Mr Straw said: "The secret intelligence service [MI6] is in the front line of our defence against terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and other threats.   "The role of the chief of the service is a vital and very demanding one. John Scarlett has the operational background, personal qualities and wide experience to be a worthy successor to Richard Dearlove."   However, the Conservatives insisted that Mr Scarlett was not the man for the job. Michael Ancram, the shadow foreign secretary, said the appointment was "inappropriate" in the context of the continuing inquries into the use of intelligence before the Iraq war.   "In today's world, Britain's secret intelligence service is central to our national security, and it is essential the whole country has the fullest confidence in it," he said.   "The government-appointed Butler inquiry is currently reviewing the whole question of intelligence, and the use made of it, in the run-up to the Iraq war. Given that John Scarlett is central to that review, and that the inquiry has not yet reported, I believe that this appointment, at this time, is inappropriate."   The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Sir Menzies Campbell, also questioned the appointment, saying: "It will only be justified if Mr Scarlett proves to be an effective head of MI6 at a time when success in the campaign against terrorism is essential.   "The responsibility for ensuring that he is not embroiled in political controversy rests fairly and squarely with ministers."   Mr Scarlett joined MI6 after leaving Magdalen College, Oxford, with a first in modern history in 1970. He speaks Russian and French, and is married with three daughters and one son.   Downing Street said Mr Scarlett would follow MI6 practice in not giving interviews, making public appearances or providing on-the-record comment.   Sir Richard is to become master at Pembroke College, Cambridge.

The United Nations' security requirements, the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code, are mandatory for all merchant ships and ports engaged in global trade.   Yet only a fifth of the world's merchant fleet is compliant with the code, due in just 40 working days, leading industry figures say.   The United States, fearful of a seaborne attack against one of its ports by al Qaeda, has said it will strictly enforce the code and expects other nations to do so, raising fears that the measures could slow or even harm world trade.   Andy Mitchell, head of the maritime security programme at ship safety and classification societies Lloyd's Register, told Reuters that of the 30,000 ships trading internationally needing to be security-certified, about 20 percent had now been approved, up from around three percent in mid-March.   "There are going to be problems. Time is running out," Mitchell said.   It was unclear how many of the 6,000 key ports involved had brought into force the new measures, said Lee Adamson of the U.N.'s International Maritime Organisation (IMO).   He too saw shipping compliance currently at 20 percent.   The measures apply to all ships - oil tankers, general cargo, and container or passenger ships - engaged in international trade.   The code also stipulates that ports visited in the complex web of trade need to be security certified and vessels required to keep a log of the last 10 ports they visit.   The U.S. Coastguard has repeatedly warned that ships, including oil tankers, that do not have security plans in place or that call at a non-compliant port could be denied entry, or in extreme circumstances be impounded.   In late April U.S. authorities said every ship seeking to call at one of its ports would be boarded and thoroughly checked from July 1.   According to the United Nations over 90 percent of world trade is transported by sea, including crucial commodities like oil, gas, coal, iron ore and grains.   Leading maritime security firms that are advising signatory nations on implementing the measures at ports have told Reuters that many, mostly in the developing world and including some leading OPEC oil exporters, are struggling to meet the deadline.

Expansion as a Strategic Threat    In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the reinvented partnership between the United States and Russia has been heralded as an end to the Cold War Era. However, Moscow's continued objections against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (N.A.T.O.) could serve as an indication that Russia still faces immense challenges on the path toward integration with the West.    N.A.T.O. has tried to reassure Moscow that the expansion is not directed against Russia. Nonetheless, Russia seems to feel isolated and threatened as up to two thirds of Russians view N.A.T.O. as an "aggressive" bloc, according to recent opinion polls.   Russia fears that N.A.T.O. will go on expanding and the next round of expansion could involve Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries, completing what is seen in Moscow as the geopolitical encirclement of Russia. Some Russian commentators say that the eastward expansion of N.A.T.O. constitutes the biggest threat to their country since the Second World War.   Russia's fears of encirclement were heightened by speculation that other former Soviet states could eventually join N.A.T.O. Rumors swirled in Moscow that the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan could join N.A.T.O. as well. In April, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry had to issue a statement indicating that Kazakhstan had no plans to join the bloc.   Nonetheless, the State Duma, which is the lower house of the Russian parliament, lashed out at N.A.T.O.'s expansion to Russia's frontiers and urged the Russian government to re-think its defense strategies and deployment of its forces. The Duma's pro-Kremlin majority overwhelmingly approved a resolution that strongly urged N.A.T.O. members to ratify an amended version of the Conventional Forces in Europe (C.F.E.) treaty that would include restrictions on the deployment of weapons near Russia's borders.   In May 2002, Russia joined the N.A.T.O.-Russian Council, which gave Moscow a role in drafting and implementing several common policies on peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, weapons proliferation, humanitarian intervention and regional crises. The creation of the council indicated a transformation of N.A.T.O., which was established in 1949 to defend the West against the Soviet threat.   On March 29, N.A.T.O. expanded to 26 states, incorporating seven new members. Now Moscow argues that N.A.T.O.'s move eastward contradicted its pledge to enhance cooperation with Russia in counter-terrorism, nonproliferation, peacekeeping and other areas, contained in the 2002 agreement. N.A.T.O., in turn, has blamed Russia for failing to fulfill its pledge to withdraw its troops from the former Soviet states of Georgia and Moldova. Moscow argues that Georgia and Moldova are unrelated to the C.F.E.   Despite heated objections, the Kremlin has said that Russia would continue to cooperate with N.A.T.O. However, Moscow indicated it could reassess its military planning in view of what it called N.A.T.O.'s aggressive strategy. Moscow was particularly unhappy with N.A.T.O.'s decision to deploy aircraft to defend the airspace of the three ex-Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as soon as they join the bloc.   Although no other countries were likely to be invited to join N.A.T.O. soon, Moscow has sounded increasingly nervous about N.A.T.O.'s eastward expansion. Many Russian media outlets commented that N.A.T.O. aircraft would be deployed "in five minute flight time" from the country's second largest city, St. Petersburg.   Of course, four old Belgian jets patrolling Baltic airspace hardly present any threat to Russia. Nevertheless, Russia's time-honored fears of encirclement resurfaced in the 1990s, when Russian power and influence hit near all-time lows. Furthermore, Moscow probably feels that its recent friendly moves towards the West did not really pay off.   In the wake of September 11, Russia has undertaken a series of gestures towards the U.S. In October 2002, the Kremlin announced a shut down of its Cold War Era military facilities: a spy radar station in Lourdes, Cuba and a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam to spare more money for the Russian armed forces. Russia also dropped its initial opposition to the stationing of American military forces close to its borders in Central Asia.   Moscow's pro-Western course after September 11 reaped benefits for Russia. Notably, in May 2002 Russia and the U.S. signed a legally binding treaty to reduce the two countries' long-range nuclear weapons by two-thirds and liquidate the legacy of the Cold War. Russia's new cooperative face secured U.S. backing for Moscow's efforts to join the World Trade Organization (W.T.O.). Russia also received membership in the G8 group of the most industrialized countries. Russia was recognized as a market economy by the United States and the European Union in 2002.   The invitation to Russia in 2002 for full participation in political and economic discussions, as well as to host the 2006 meeting of the G8, acknowledged Russian support in Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks, and President Vladimir Putin's decision to accept the next round of N.A.T.O. expansion quietly.   As both N.A.T.O. and the European Union creep closer to the Russian frontiers, Moscow seems to opt a path of compromise. Russia and the E.U., which on May 1 expanded deep into Eastern Europe, had agreed in principle on all outstanding problems Moscow had with E.U. expansion, apart from the rights of Russian speakers in the Baltic States.   Russia and the E.U. forged a last minute agreement on April 27. The extension to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (P.C.A.) means that the ten new members joining the E.U. will trade with Russia under the same rules as the E.U.'s 15 existing members. The agreement comes after months of Russian refusal to sign the extension to the P.C.A. unless certain concerns were dealt with. The deal covers trade and all political, economic and cultural links between Moscow and the E.U.   The E.U. had insisted that the P.C.A. be extended automatically, causing a stalemate that lasted for months. Russia fears losing the trade benefits it enjoys with many of the new members, eight of which are former communist countries with which Moscow has close ties. Russia has been seeking compensation for the expansion. Moscow forwarded a list of 14 demands, including one to raise quotas on Russian steel imports.   The E.U. demanded that foreign and independent firms be allowed access to Russia's gas pipelines and to raise domestic gas prices to international levels. Russia's state-controlled monopoly Gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, opposes any liberalization of the system. But Moscow would not be prepared to hike domestic gas prices and remove another major E.U. objection to its W.T.O. accession.   Russia and the E.U. also struck a deal on cargo shipments to and from Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, which is wedged between incoming E.U. members Poland and Lithuania.   Yet progress on negotiations on Russia's entry into the W.T.O. remained slow. The E.U. reportedly offered Moscow smoother accession in exchange for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a global environmental pact that the E.U. has pressured Moscow to ratify.   The European Union and Moscow have yet to solve a dispute over treatment of the Russian minorities in the Baltics, particularly in Latvia and Estonia. Russia has long complained about what it calls discrimination against Russian-speakers in Estonia and Latvia. In the end, the joint declaration did not specifically refer to Russian minorities but to minorities in general.   Russian objections against N.A.T.O.'s eastward expansion, combined with long-standing Russian fears and suspicions over Western intentions, demonstrate that Moscow still faces a long path towards full-scale partnership with its Cold War Era foes.

Two guided-missile destroyers, four guided-missile frigates and two submarines displayed China's military strength for the first time since the territory was handed over by Britain in 1997. It marked a distinct change of tactics by Beijing.   The Chinese military has been a nearly invisible presence here for the last seven years. Soldiers are required to wear civilian clothing when they leave their bases, and the main base is tucked away on an island at the harbor's western end.  But today, residents here watched as a submarine sailed past the downtown Bank of China tower, designed by I.M. Pei. Sailors in dress whites lined the sides of the destroyers and frigates, and some gave friendly waves to workers on a passing tugboat.  The People's Liberation Army described the visit as an occasion to honor the navy's 55th anniversary. But there was no such visit on the 50th anniversary in 1999. Today's display, too, came as people favoring popular elections here find themselves under growing pressure.  The city's best-known radio talk show host, Albert Cheng, a longtime supporter of greater democracy and a critic of the local government, flew to Europe on Sunday, beginning a vacation that he said would last for the rest of the year.  He left behind a tape recording, aired Monday, in which he complained of growing threats of violence against himself and his family. It described an increasingly "suffocating" political atmosphere.  Raymond Wong, Mr. Cheng's co-host of the popular, Chinese-language "Teacup in a Storm" show, said in a telephone interview today that he was considering whether to resign. He described receiving many anonymous death threats that, he said, were not troubling to him but had alarmed his family.  Mr. Wong owns a noodle shop and Mr. Cheng a small trading company. Both businesses have been vandalized with large quantities of red paint at night this spring.  Auto dealerships owned by Mainland Chinese enterprises have pulled their advertising from Apple Daily, one of the city's largest Chinese-language newspapers and a rare supporter of greater democracy.  Most of Hong Kong's pro-Beijing property tycoons have also been withholding ads from the newspaper since this territory's democracy movement began gathering steam last summer, according to an Apple Daily executive who insisted on anonymity.  Beijing has made a series of moves in the past four months to block further democracy here. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress announced last week that it would not allow introduction of universal suffrage in elections for the next chief executive in 2007 or for many seats in the Legislative Council in 2008.  London and Washington denounced that decision as undermining the autonomy of Hong Kong, something that China had promised to uphold. China rejected the criticism, pointing out that the British had opposed democratic freedoms through most of the century-and-a-half Hong Kong was a colony.  Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, issued a statement today highlighting Beijing's willingness to dictate rules for the 2008 legislative elections, something it does not have a legal right to do under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution. Moody's said that Beijing's actions made it more clear that the credit ratings of Hong Kong and China should be linked. Moody's already does that informally, although still granting Hong Kong a rating one notch better than the mainland's.  Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, tried to amend a non-binding motion in the legislature last Friday to condemn Beijing's decision. Rita Fan, the president of the Legislative Council, who was appointed to the body by a Beijing-dominated committee, ruled that the amendment was out of order.   Ma Lik, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, the main pro-Beijing party, said he opposed any threats against democracy advocates. He questioned whether Mr. Cheng and Mr. Wong had really been in any danger.  While noting that both men had frequently criticized him on the air, Mr. Ma challenged them to identify those responsible for threatening them. "We want to know who frightened them, and we will fight for their freedom of speech," Mr. Ma said. 	 Mr. Lee said that he doubted that Beijing would order any direct measures to harm democracy advocates here. "They kill your reputation, but not you," he said.  Hong Kong has long had an extreme leftist, pro-mainland fringe that is not under the control of either Beijing or the Democratic Alliance. It may, however, have been emboldened by recent strong criticisms of democracy advocates by pro-Beijing media, said Joseph Cheng, a pro-democracy professor of political science at Hong Kong University who is not related to Albert Cheng.  In sailing along the harbor after a six-day visit to a naval base at the harbor's western end, the Chinese flotilla clearly chose the most visible route possible. Most ships sail in or out of the western harbor without going through the central harbor itself - an increasingly narrow route. Because of landfills, that is now limited mostly to cruise ships and occasional pleasure craft.  Joseph Cheng said that the flotilla's visit could prove a shrewd move by China, because the well-behaved People's Liberation Army forces evoke feelings of patriotism among many Hong Kong residents.   Mr. Lee criticized the naval display today as unnecessary. "Nobody here wants independence, so there's absolutely no need for them to do this," he said.   Robert Karniol, the Asia-Pacific editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, said that today's naval display was consistent with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which Britain acknowledged that China would have full responsibility for the defense of Hong Kong. The two guided-missile destroyers, the Shenzhen and the Harbin, that sailed past the office towers of central Hong Kong are among the more modern vessels in China's fleet, he added.

The new era of European enlargement will be no exception.    Europe has never existed. It must be created." So said Jean Monnet, father of the original Common Market, at the outset of the grand experiment that over the past five decades grew to become the modern European Union. Were he alive today, would Monnet survey his creation with pride-or reservation?  On May 1, Europe braces for another of its periodic Big Bangs. Not war but its antithesis-a regime of stability and (one hopes) growing prosperity spanning a region of 370 million citizens from the Aran Islands to Carpathia. Ten new nations will join the existing 15 members of the European club: eight formerly communist countries of Eastern Europe and the Baltics, plus the divided island of Cyprus and tiny Malta. It is by far the most ambitious enlargement ever undertaken by the European community. Yet curiously, this epochal step inspires more angst than euphoria.   Ask a German diplomat about the EU of tomorrow, and he pauses. "The new Europe," he says thoughtfully, "is looking more and more like the old Europe." For half a century, he explains, Europe has dedicated itself to overcoming division and creating an "ever-closer" political and economic union. The Europe of the future, he predicts, will retreat from this ideal. Instead of coming together, Europe's trajectory will be more toward the past-more toward discord and division than toward unity. Years from now, as  The Economist magazine recently put it, Europeans may well look back at today's era as a lost "golden age" of harmony and good feeling. With only slight exaggeration, May 1 can be viewed as marking the beginning of the end of "Europe."   Too pessimistic? Consider recent headlines, challenging traditional assumptions that Europeans inhabit a common house. British Prime Minister Tony Blair last week changed direction and called for a national referendum on Europe's new draft Constitution, painstakingly cobbled together over the past two years and needing unanimous ratification by the Union's member governments. Blair could have simply approved the document; by turning it over to voters, likely to reject it, he in effect cast a veto over the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, as the Union dismantles geographical barriers to the free movement of people and goods, others are going up. Fearing floods of immigrants from the East, taking jobs from locals and overwhelming social services, governments across the Continent have hastily erected restrictions against the incoming members of their European family. Germany and France, among others, have barred such workers from seeking jobs for periods ranging from three to seven years. Similar controversies have erupted over everything from the EU's budget to economic development. After years of touting their commitment to helping their neighbors rebuild from years of communism-much as they helped Greece, Spain and Portugal resurrect themselves from decades of autocracy-the rich members of the Union are balking at the cost.   Spats over budgets and internal migration may pass with time, but some of the endings occasioned by May 1 will be more enduring. Consider three:    THE END OF EUROPE AS THE WEST:   "If you want to read the future of Europe, look east," says Jean-Marie Colombani, director of Le Monde in Paris. Until now, the European Union has been a purely West European institution, whose interests lay traditionally within the geography of the NATO alliance. With enlargement, he argues, "the center of gravity of the old Continent will move east." Europe's new backyard is a morass of failing states-Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova-whose problems will become Europe's. "What are the priorities of Poland, Hungary and the Baltic nations?" asks Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoanna, whose own country seeks to join the EU. The first is to reap the economic rewards of EU membership. But the second, he says, is to ensure their own security-and that means shifting Europe's diplomatic and financial attention to the problems on their periphery to the east, in lands Western Europe has long ignored.     THE END OF AMERICA IN EUROPE:   Ever since World War II, the United States has been a European power. It created NATO and planted the original seed of European integration by making Marshall Plan aid contingent upon it. It was the guarantor of cold-war security. Transatlantic tensions over the Iraq war are only one sign that Europe and the United States are today on divergent paths. U.S. strategic interests long ago shifted to the Middle East and Asia, says Ronald Steel, author of "Temptations of a Superpower." If America was present at the creation of Europe's postwar order, it is now bidding adieu at its passing.     THE END OF EVER-CLOSER UNION:   Even in its earliest days, when the modern EU was but a glimmer in the eyes of the creators of the original European Coal and Steel Community, Europe held close to a dream. It went by various names: "more Europe," "deeper Europe" and, of course, "ever-closer union." It began with the relatively simple task of eliminating tariffs and was to culminate in a "federal Europe," with governments devolving economic and political sovereignty upon the institutions of the European Union. Visionaries predicted the end of the nation-state.   As the EU embarks on its boldest move yet, that dream is all but dead. Yes, never before has such a broad swathe of Europe been subject to the harmonizing rule of Brussels. Yet Germany and France, once the locomotives of union, have lately gutted the EU stability pact limiting the fiscal independence of member governments. Joined by Britain, they have reaffirmed the primacy of national governments in foreign and social policy.  The beleaguered new Constitution-an attempt to define what it is to be European, and how "Europe" should govern itself-resides in emblematic limbo. Ever-closer union? "Not in our lifetimes," predicts the German diplomat.   "If this is the end of old Europe, what is now beginning," asks Tony Judt, director of the Remarque Institute at New York University. As he and many others see it, Europe's future will be managing its growing diversity. Mounting immigration, especially Muslim, will increasingly alter Europe's ethnic and cultural landscape. Changing demographics will undermine Europe's traditional social-welfare states. If old Europe faced the challenge of integrating like with like, the new Europe must reconcile unlike with unlike, grappling with prickly issues of minorities, wealth versus poverty and national identity. "It will be an era of discord and civilizational clashes within states and communities," says Judt, "no longer mainly among them." Europe's disparate citizenry will argue for their very different interests and priorities with increasing vehemence, all the more so if Europe's economy does not keep pace with the region's expectations. The cozy days of a close and like-minded European club are gone. Back to the future? It looks very much that way.   Source;  Newsweek International, May 2004. © 2004 Newsweek, Inc.

(Catholics and Muslims)   The Vatican has never been simply he religious headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. It has always been involved in politics to promote or defend its doctrines and institutions. In this effort, the Vatican has at times supported violent conflict while on other occasions stressed peace and tolerance. In recent years it has been troubled by the growth of the Islamic population in Europe, which some Catholic leaders call "a program of expansion and reconquest."    The National Catholic Reporter in October 1999 noted that, according to the United Nations, the Islamic population grew by more than 100 percent in Europe from 1989 to 1998 to fourteen million, while over the same period "the Muslim population in the United States grew by 25 percent to 4.9 million." Specifically, French Catholic leader Alain Besancon indicated that there are between four and five million Muslims in France - roughly the same as the number of practicing Catholics. Marseilles is expected to become the first city in Europe with a non-European majority.   These are not just theoretical concerns about the future. There have been violent clashes between Catholics and Muslims in the past, even though the Vatican kept a low profile and tried to involve other nations in diplomacy. One such clash occurred in Lebanon in the early 1970s when the Maronites - one of the major Christian groups in Lebanon, whose relation to the Vatican dates back to the period of the Crusades - contacted the Vatican to find out about possible training centers for Maronite militia in Europe.  According to George E. Irani's 1986 book, The Papacy and the Middle East: The Role of the Holy See in the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1962-1984:  -	A secret military organization based in Rome sent experts who had previous experience in the wars of southern Sudan and Biafra.... These experts in guerilla warfare picked the best among Christian militias and sent them to the city of Anvers [Belgium] where they joined special training centers.... [The Vatican] advised the Maronite monks to fund the training of the militias through the Phalangist Party.   The Vatican did not seek the defeat of the Muslims or other groups but involved the United States and France and initiated its own efforts with the fundamental objective "to save Lebanon as an independent state in order to protect the Christian presence not only in Lebanon but throughout the Middle East."   In Europe, the Vatican has for many years viewed Croatia as a Catholic bulwark against Muslims from the Middle East and against Soviet penetration from the east. When Croatia became part of Yugoslavia after World War I, Vatican policy changed after a decade to one of detaching Croatia and building it as a uniquely Catholic state hostile to Yugoslavia.   A group of fascist terrorists known as Ustashi allied itself with Italian Premier Benito Mussolini and also worked with Germany's Adolf Hitler. Under the lead of Ante Pavelic, the Ustashi created the Independent Government of Croatia and was officially welcomed by the Catholic hierarchy through Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac. Stepinac was the head of the Council of Bishops in Yugoslavia and also the military apostolic vicar of the Ustashi army. Pope Pius XII not only bestowed his paternal protection upon Pavelic and the new Croatian state but allied the Roman Catholic church with Italian, Spanish, and German fascism. When World War II ended and Mussolini and Hitler were defeated, Pavelic hid at the Vatican before going to Argentina; Yugoslavia was reconstructed.   Since memories are short, in 1991 and 1992 both Croatia and Slovenia, predominantly Catholic republics, declared their independence and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman revived the Ustashi flag. The Vatican was the first to recognize Croatian independence while the republic was fighting against Serbs and Bosnian Muslims. Toward the end of 1993, Croatian leaders stated that Muslim militants were about to begin a full-scale jihad against the West. Iran had sent financial aid and several hundred revolutionary guards as military instructors to Bosnia.   Pope John Paul II, however, realized that if the Muslims were defeated Islamic nations would turn against the Christian West. So he worked against the massacre of the Muslims and pressured the leaders of the Western alliance to step in. This eventually happened when the United States sent covert arms to the Muslims and through the Dayton accords arrived at a truce in 1995 to stop the war.   An important factor in Catholic support of Croatia was Opus Dei (The Work of God), a secret and highly disciplined order with huge sums of money and 80,000 members worldwide. It was successful early in the papacy of John Paul in persuading him to make the order his personal prelature--the equivalent of a bishopric without a territory. The most exhaustive book on the subject, Their Kingdom Come: Inside the Secret World of Opus Dei, written by investigative reporter Robert Hutchson in 1997, says:  -	Opus Dei's Washington network, which by then (1993) extended from the papal nunciature on Massachusetts Avenue to the White House, the F.B.I., and the Pentagon, provided the Croats with the right contacts.  An Opus Dei member, Father Ron Gillis, revealed that the order "was attempting to recruit inside the Pentagon and that he himself regularly gave lectures there on military ethics."   In 1994 Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak appealed to the Clinton administration for help "in educating the Croatian General Staff." The State Department agreed to let Military Professional Resources (MPR) go to Zagreb after a visit to the Croatian capital in September 1994 by John Paul, who urged the Croats to continue standing firm for Christendom. Retired U.S. Army generals and colonels led MPR. Its aim was to change Croatia's army into one that could get battlefield superiority over Serbia. Upon Croatia's request, Iran was also given the opportunity to ship arms to Bosnian Muslims through Croatia so they could defend themselves against the Serbs.   While these developments with Croatia were taking place, John Paul was advised by Opus Dei leaders to form an alliance with Islamic fundamentalists to prevent the September 1994 United Nations-sponsored Cairo Conference on Population and Development from approving contraception and abortion. A papal envoy was sent to Iran and to Libya a month before the conference and deals were arranged for fundamentalists' support in Cairo. Opus Dei also organized a closed-door conference in Barcelona, Spain, in early 1995 to deal with Islamic immigration to Europe and also the fact that Islam was winning recruits among Europe's Catholics by the hundreds each year.   These efforts have been part of the Vatican's larger strategy to deal with Islamic forces. Alternately, it has been one of negotiation and one of conflict, preferably enlisting others to fight the Vatican's wars.   In February 1993 John Paul visited Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, where a war had been going on between the Islamic north and the Christian south. The Sudanese government had cleaned up the Cathedral at Khartoum and prepared a nearby square for an open-air mass for the pope. However, he failed to achieve better relations when he warned Islamic leaders head on to stop killing Christians in the south and to stop the "terrible harvest of suffering." Not long thereafter, the Sudanese north began a new offensive in the south.   The Vatican did not respond immediately, but sometime in 1995 Christian Solidarity International appeared in the south. The organization enlisted support from neighboring countries and built a disciplined resistance force.  No one seems to know anything about its origin or whence came its resources, but it was able to destroy an elite mechanized division from the north and take all of its equipment.   Pope John Paul II has no hesitation about the killing of those he regards as opponents. He holds that "Christians [Catholics] have a right and even a duty to protect their existence and freedom by proportionate means against an unjust aggressor." The word unjust is used to define any war against the church. And if there is any doubt about Opus Dei and its relation to the papacy, it is dispelled by Their Kingdom Come, which quotes two rules of the secret order: "The lesson is clear, crystal clear: All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient" and "Dirty clothes are washed at home."   John Paul has apologized specifically to Jews for the centuries of anti-Semitism by the church's people, but he has never apologized specifically to Muslims for the many crusades organized against them. Father Georges Cottier, a theologian whose international theological commission helped draft Memory and Reconciliation: The Church and the Mistakes of the Past, explained why not in the March 2, 2000, New York Times:  -	It cannot be done with the Muslims, because Islam does not recognize the Christian notion of pardon.... In places where Christians [Catholics] and Christian missionaries are in the minority, it would be taken as a sign of weakness. We couldn't write it down that way, but that was the thought.  In other words, even the pope's apologies for past sins of church members were not simply spiritual pronouncements but matters of strategy evaluated by the potential response of his audience.   Would an apology specifically to Muslims make a difference in relations with Islamic nations? It might, because there are millions of nonfundamentalist moderate Muslims in Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. But until then, anyone who reads the news about violence against Christians (Catholics) and against Muslims anywhere in the world should be aware of the consequences of the conflict between two of the world's numerically largest religious groups-each numbering about one billion people and each with antagonism toward the other.

Given the sorry condition of public education, many Americans today would have no idea which war our current Republic fought first. The real fighting began in this war early in 1804, two hundred years ago. Sad, because this war is probably the best example of how different America and Europe approach terrorism.    The Barbary Pirates, like al-Qaida, were organized terrorists; they, like al-Qaida, were Moslems who originally began their terrorism as part of a general religious war against Christians; they, like many of the Islamic terrorists today, operated in the Mediterranean Basin; these pirates, like al-Qaida, lived nominally within another nation, the Ottoman Empire, but they operated outside the control of this nation and beyond the reach of international law.   Most European nations appeased the Barbary Pirates. Rather than confront these outlaws, European nations allowed themselves to be blackmailed. These bigger and more powerful nations gave money to the Barbary Pirates so that these goons would leave them alone.   America, young, small and weak at the time, took a radically different attitude. The whole world knew that the actions of the Barbary Pirates were wrong, but only America decided to fight this wrong. "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!" was the battle cry of our infant nation.   We projected our naval and marine power to a place almost as far away as Iraq, and using dash and daring, we defeated the Barbary Pirates.  Considering how much millions of dollars was in 1804 (hundreds of billions of dollars today) and considering how much farther Tripoli was given the technology of the time, our victory - without coalition forces - was much more daunting that our liberation of Afghanistan or Iraq.   Special forces, the United States Marines, and our small, but robust navy, did what no European nation thought possible or prudent. Our Marines projected American power "to the shores of Tripoli" as the Marine Corps Hymn recounts. Although it would take eleven years, with European nations finally following the lead of America, to end completely the threat of the Barbary Pirates, the pirates learned that hurting America was very counterproductive.   This, perhaps, should be our reaction to the faint hearts and trembling hands of European politicians today. The Barbary Wars were fought to protect Americans, not Europeans. The national security policy of the United States at that point in history was "Don't Tread on Me." Perhaps that should be our policy again.   What if America advised al-Qaida, Kim Jong Il, the mullahs of Iran and other modern pirates and pirate nations that if they kill Americans or attack America, then we will use our global power to hit them back hard? What if America qualified that by saying "Don't Tread on Me" rather than "Don't Tread on Civilization"?   Is there a particular reason that we should defend modern, affluent democracies treat us contemptuously for our help? Maybe we should consider more the position of Israel, which relies upon no one for its defense, but insures that it is defended. Our ability to project power into Afghanistan and into Iraq should chill the heart of any terrorist groups who gratuitously provoked our wrath.   Instead of bringing democracy to Iraq perhaps we should divide it into three smaller nations and quite deliberately throw our considerable support behind any or all of these new governments whose policies toward America are friendly.   Instead of bringing democracy to Syria, perhaps we should simply overwhelm that nation, divide it as well, and create two or three new nations dependent upon our goodwill for their success against other rivals.   Instead of worrying about the life of other peoples, we should worry about only ourselves. We are accused of doing this anyway, so what if we pronounced that this, indeed, would be our policy? I wonder what the world would say.   The practical effect of our First American War - the war that began in earnest exactly 200 years ago - was that the rest of the world, including Europe, suddenly took us very seriously. "Don't Tread on Me" may be an imperfect motto for our national policy, but in light of a fickle Spain, an ungrateful France, and grumbling already in Iraq, maybe that is the best policy we can take. It worked magnificently once.    Write;  by Bruce Walker writes regular, original, and weekly columns for Enter Stage Right and Conservative Truth.

        HIGHLIGHTS   SOUTH AFRICA – LEGAL   You'll pay, US lawyer tells SA government   Six apartheid victims, including the mother of a teenager shot dead in the 1976 Soweto riots, are seeking $20-billion dollars (about R140-billion) in a lawsuit targeting the South African government and major corporations, their lawyer said on Monday.   The suit was filed in New York District Court on Saturday, demanding at least $10-billion for "genocide, expropriation and other wrongful acts" by international companies under apartheid, American lawyer Ed Fagan told a news conference.  The plaintiffs are also seeking another $10-billion in damages because President Thabo Mbeki's government "continued to allow companies to exploit victims without protecting them, allowing industry to violate people's rights."  'These companies were strategic partners of the apartheid government' The full amount would be paid into what Fagan termed a "humanitarian fund."  "At the end of the day these companies were strategic partners of the (apartheid) government," Fagan said.  The post-apartheid government set up in 1994 was targeted in the case "because of its failure to fulfil its obligations and its conspiracy with specific companies to violate these people's rights," he added.  Apart from Mbeki, the suit targets mining giants Anglo American and Goldfields; United States computer giant IBM; UBS Bank of Switzerland and South African petroleum giant Sasol.  Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Dorothy Molefi, the mother of 13-year-old Hector Petersen, who was shot dead in Soweto in June 1976 when police opened fire on schoolchildren and teenagers who had gathered to protest against the imposition of Afrikaans - seen as the language of the white oppressors - in schools.    'South African matters resolved in South Africa'   The picture of Petersen being carried away by two teenagers became iconic of black South Africa's struggle against racist oppression.  Mbeki's spokesperson Bheki Khumalo said the government would defend its case, but wanted "South African matters resolved in South Africa."  "If Ed Fagan has decided to do this and he has indicated that he is doing it, well, the government will have to go to court and defend itself. We are convinced that we have a winable case."  Mbeki has in the past condemned any moves to sue major companies in the US, arguing that many of the companies were now assisting in South Africa's development.  Fagan said the civil action was separate to that of a class action on behalf of apartheid victims already before a New York court, and from which South African lawyers claimed Fagan had been dismissed.  This was disputed by the flamboyant US lawyer: "I was never fired. I merely took a back seat. It was them who were fired."  He has also drawn scathing criticism from civic groups for raising the expectations of poor and mainly black victims of apartheid.  Fagan became prominent when he won a $1.2-billion compensation claim by Holocaust survivors against Swiss banks, including UBS and Credit Suisse, in 1998.  Fagan said his clients would give the South African government two weeks to respond to a "proposal" - without divulging details - before the case would go ahead.  "Make no mistake about this. This is not a game, it is not a procedural play, it is not a show. It is a deadly serious lawsuit, it has legal legs, it has legal precedent.  "If our allegations are true, you are going to pay," he said.  Fagan said he did not want to comment on the other case already before the New York courts - in which judgment had been reserved - were 34 companies were being sued for billions of dollars.

More than 130 members of the 250-seat legislature have prepared a draft of the "America Accountability Act" that would impose "strict sanctions" on American interests in Syria.  In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Damascus, parliament officials said the draft law is a response to "Washington's policy in the region and its unlimited support and bias for Israeli policies and practices and to the Syria Accountability Act."  The Syria Accountability Act is a U.S. law passed last year that calls for sanctions against Syria for its alleged support of terrorism. Syria denies the U.S. claims and says the sanctions are political.  Muhammad Habash, a lawmaker with moderate Islamic affiliations who is one of the campaigners for the draft law, said the law was meant to maintain the dignity of Syrians.  "We are not simple-minded to the degree that we imagine we can affect the great American economy," he said. "But we are able to maintain our dignity and slap the Americans so they know that if they continue with their arrogant policies, people everywhere around the globe will spit at them."  In May, President Bush banned all U.S. exports to Syria except for food and medicine, and banned Syrian flights to and from the United States after long-standing complaints that Syria was supporting terrorism and undermining U.S. efforts in Iraq.  The sanctions were based on the Syria Accountability Act. The parliament statement said lawmakers would submit the draft law for a vote June 27 during a Parliament session in which Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara will explain the Syrian government's rationale for imposing the sanctions. The statement said the law was expected to pass overwhelmingly.  It would have to be ratified by President Bashar Assad before becoming law.  The statement did not give details on the nature of the sanctions Syria will impose.  Lawmaker Suleiman Haddad said the sanctions may be in the form of boycotting American goods but would not be a complete boycott of the United States, though he said some members of parliament supported that option.  "We in Syria believe that there is still a thread between us and America," Haddad said in a telephone interview Saturday. He said the sanctions would not impose restrictions on U.S. companies working in his country.  Trade between the United States and Syria amounts to $300 million a year. Several U.S. companies operate in Syria, which in the last year has signed oil-exploration deals with American companies worth a total of $34 million.  The U.S. sanctions imposed under the Syria Accountability Act also authorize the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of Syrian nationals and entities involved in terrorism. They also restrict relations between U.S. banks and the Syrian national banks.

An Ingushetia Interior Ministry official said the attack on the ministry building in the city of Nazran began late on Monday. The official also said police buildings in Ordzhonikidzevskaya, just over the border from Chechnya, and in Karabulak have been seized by other attackers.  There is no official word on casualties, but witnesses said that dozens bodies are lying around the Interior Ministry building.  Ingush sources reported that Interior Minister of Ingushetia Murad Kostoev was dead. Dozens of Russian occupation solders and FSB servicemen's were kill when Mujahideen attack Russian military bases in Ingushetia.  In an interview on Radio Liberty last week, Chechnya's president Aslan Maskhadov said that Chechen solders were preparing to undertake new offensives.  "We are planning to change tactics. Before, we concentrated our efforts on acts of sabotage, but soon we are planning to start active military actions," he said.  A three-man crew from Russia's NTV television came upon some of the attackers at a border crossing as they tried to reach Nazran from neighboring North Ossetia.  "Out of the dark, a voice says 'Stop, put your hands on the hood,' said NTV correspondent Maxim Berezin. "A man carrying an automatic weapon came up. 'Who are you?' 'We're from NTV.' He took a few steps back, as if to shoot us.  "Then he said, 'Say that we are the Martyr's Brigade,' I don't remember of whom, Abu, Alyua, I don't remember what he said. 'We have shot everyone here. Go and announce that.'"  The town of Karabulak and village of Sleptsovskaya also came under attack. Mujahideen killed many Russian occupation solders on military base in Troickaya village near airport. Reports say a multiple rocket launcher was being fired in Nazran and other towns of Ingushetia, and people were sheltering in cellars.  Reports also say that 30 solders of Interior Ministry of Ingushetia were dead.  At 3 a.m. 22 June Mujahideen are begin leave villages and towns of Ingushetia.

Greeted with a standing ovation, Annan opened the first U.N.- organized seminar dedicated to anti-Semitism in response to charges that the world body dwelled on Palestinian rights and deliberately ignored injustices to Israelis and Jews.  "When we seek justice for the Palestinians - as we must - let us firmly disavow anyone who tries to use that cause to incite hatred against Jews, in Israel or elsewhere," Annan told the gathering, which included a wide spectrum of American Jewish groups and representatives of other religions.  Annan said it was hard to believe that 60 years after the Holocaust that anti-Semitism was rearing its head.  "But it is clear that we are witnessing an alarming resurgence of this phenomenon in new forms and manifestations," he said. "This time the world must not, cannot be silent.  Annan called on U.N. member states to adopt a resolution to combat anti-Semitism, similar to one approved in April by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Fifty-five nations said the Middle East conflict could never justify anti-Semitism and attacks on Jews.  He also said the Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights, should examine anti-Semitism with the same diligence it looked into racism against Muslims in various parts of the world.  "Are not Jews entitled to the same degree of concern and protection?" Annan asked.  Jewish leaders pointed to dissent in the Arab world they say is descending into expressions of extreme anti-Semitism and a flurry of incidents in Europe, especially in France and Russia, they felt had not been addressed properly.  Only Germany came in for praise for its education system and tough laws to combat anti-Semitism, despite rising fears among the Jewish community there. There was little discussion of anti-Semitism in the United States where there are about 5 million Jews, slightly more than in Israel.  Author Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor, said he thought anti-Semitism had perished in the Auschwitz death camp, but "only the Jews perished there."  Wiesel, the keynote speaker, said that discriminating against Jews often translated into hatred against all minorities and "those who are different."  "When we urge you to fight anti-Semitism, it is because we want to save other people as well," he said.  Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, demanded Annan appoint an official charged with combating anti-Semitism, an annual report on the subject and a resolution to "unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism."  The United Nations came in for heavy criticism, especially from Anne Bayefsky, a professor and fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, who said Israel was demonized on a regular basis while Arab nations got away with redrawing the map of the Middle East.  To cheers from the audience, she castigated the United Nations as well as Annan for an "inability to confront the corruption of its agenda."   Felice Gaer, a human rights and U.N. expert from the American Jewish Committee, said there were enough U.N. resolutions on the books against racism and intolerance but U.N. officials appeared afraid to activate them.  But she called Annan's address "forthright and unique in U.N. history. "It's as good as it gets," she said.

A British military spokesman said the craft, which entered Iran's territorial waters, cannot be contacted.  Eight British sailors have been arrested by Iran. The seacraft were detained near the Iraqi border after, said Iran, they had entered its waters without permission.  A spokesman for the officially appointed Iranian Revolutionary Guards said: "We got news that a number of foreign vessels entered Iranian waters without permission.  "Three boats were guided to Iranian shores and more than five crew were arrested."  Iranian naval sources told the country's media eight British crew were arrested after their vessels were found to contain weapons and maps.  One station said the crew had confessed to making "a mistake" and that the Iranian navy had confiscated the three vessels.  The confrontation was said to have taken place in the Shatt al Arab stretch of water between Iraq and Iran.  Sky News' Foreign Editor Tim Marshall said: "Iran is making a point to Britain probably, and that point is 'back off'."  He added that Iran may be using the incident as a bargaining tool against British-backed UN demands on its nuclear programme.  A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defence said it was investigating the reports. Royal Navy boats patrol the waterway - a highly disputed boundary between Iraq and Iraq - to prevent smuggling.

The San Jose Mercury News said Monday the proposed November ballot measure was aimed at getting more parents involved in their children's education by waiving California's requirement that voters be U.S. citizens.  San Francisco has long been a home to a large Asian immigrant community as well as growing numbers of Latinos. Only those non-citizens with children in public school would be allowed to vote, and only in school board elections.  The Mercury said a similar proposal that would have allowed immigrants to vote in all municipal elections was rejected in 1996 by a judge who ruled the move would require an amendment to the state constitution.  If passed, the measure would be the first in California, although similar laws have been enacted in New York, Chicago and Maryland.

Beheading has been adapted widely by Muslim radicals for killing enemies in recent conflicts in Algeria, Bosnia and Chechnya, experts said.  But the executioners of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002, Pennsylvania businessman Nick Berg in Iraq on May 11 and aviation engineer Paul Johnson in Saudi Arabia on Friday have turned the act into propaganda by using digital cameras to record the spectacle.  On Friday, the grisly images were posted on the Web for a global audience, including Westerners for whom decapitation is particularly shocking.  The Site Institute - a Washington organization which tracks terrorist groups - located on Friday an Arabic-language communiqué about Mr. Johnson's killing accompanied by grim photographs of the murder on a website set up recently using the free service provided by Geocities, a subsidiary of Yahoo!.  Said Site analyst Josh Devon: 'Terrorism doesn't work unless the media is involved. Shooting someone isn't necessarily terrorism.  Beheading someone and posting it on the Web is terrorism.'  In Mr. Pearl's case, video footage of the murder was delivered to the US consulate in Karachi. Only later was it posted on the Internet and aired in part by CBS News.  The video of Mr. Berg's killing was posted immediately on the Web, provoking a storm of grief and outrage.  Mr. Johnson's killers managed to draw even more attention by announcing in their Web posting on Tuesday that he would be killed in 72 hours if their demands were not met.  'Here, we had the countdown: This guy was alive, but yet we knew he was doomed as the 72-hour countdown went on,' said Mr. Robert Thompson, a media and culture expert at Syracuse University in New York.  The combination of ritual murder with digital communications 'is this bizarre collision of worlds'.  He said the Internet had a powerful pull for terror groups because it allowed instant, international distribution to groups that otherwise could not broadcast their message through traditional media.  He said terror groups had been savvy enough to recognise, however, that only the most violent, most graphic events will draw attention.  'You can't put just anything on the Internet and expect people to pay attention,' he said.  'I can think of few things other than a beheading that is able to singularly focus people's attention.'  Mr. Marc Sageman, a former CIA officer and author of Understanding Terror Networks, said militants in Algeria, Chechnya and Bosnia had used decapitation widely.  'This has become the ritual way of slaughtering infidels,' he said.  'That's the way you slaughter animals, so I suppose it's a way of saying infidels are no better than animals.'  While beheading went out of use long ago in the West, the Saudi government still uses it for executing men and occasionally women for serious crimes, occasionally including religious crimes such as blasphemy.  The government's senior executioner, Mr. Muhammad Saad al-Beshi, gave several media interviews last year, bragging that his sword is 'very sharp. People are amazed how fast it can separate the head from the body'.

We discovered bases of Colombian drug dealers in the Balkans, in particular, in Albania, he noted. They promote Colombian cocaine to Eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine.  According to Antonio Maria Costa, formerly Colombian cocaine was coming to Europe via Spain. However, Asia, first of all, Afghanistan, remains Europe's main source of cocaine and heroin.  Meanwhile, the UN report on cocaine production in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia says that illegal cocaine crops reduced by 20% in these countries.  All in all, 200,000 families live by cocaine crops in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the report proceeds.

Two hundred and forty-eight Bushmen and Bakgalagadi adults are taking the Botswana government, including President Festus Mogae, to court over the government's forced eviction of them and their families from their ancestral land, in what could be a test case for Bushman rights across southern Africa.  The in loco inspection is supposed to visit settlements from which the San were allegedly forcibly removed from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve to settlements outside the reserve.   'Expected to become farmers overnight'   The Bushmen want the government to recognise their right to return to their land and live there without fear of further eviction, and to hunt and gather freely.  The original case of forced removal from their ancestral land was dismissed on a technicality in April 2002.  However, the Bushmen appealed and won the right to have the case re-heard on its merits.  The Botswana government had initially apparently terminated all services, including water, because it claimed that it could not afford the monthly cost of Botswana pula 55 000.  The first wave of removals took place in 1997, and most of the community has since been relocated to settlements outside the park.  In exchange for their traditional hunting-gathering existence, the Botswana government claims the San have been granted title deeds to plots, a mere 40 by 40 meters, in a conservation area - the Central Kalahari Game Reserve - about the size of Belgium.  The displaced tribesmen have also allegedly been given goats and cattle.  "People as old as 80 years and older who have been hunter-gatherers all their lives were expected to become farmers overnight", a South African spokesperson for the applicants said on Monday.  But the Botswana action has drawn strident opposition from Survival International, a British organization supporting tribal communities and their rights to their land and to decide their own future.  The organization has been at the forefront of an awareness campaign; organizing petitions across the world against the removal of the San and even suggesting that diamond prospecting could be behind the relocation.  Survival International also accuses the Botswana authorities of harassment of the San, saying they have been "tortured, beaten up or arrested for supposedly over-hunting, or hunting without correct licenses."  The Botswana government has vehemently denied these allegations, as well as that diamond prospecting was at the root of the relocation.

The chart does not give the number of victims. Different sets of figures have circulated for years. In 1994 the Interior Ministry cited a figure of 11, 000. In 1996, Socialist opposition leader Hocine Ait-Ahmed estimated the number of those killed at almost half a million. In1999 Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika, then a presidential candidate, put the number at "over 100, 000". My estimate, based on information collected from many sources since 1994, produces a figure of around 28,000. But we still need years of painstaking research to establish the full facts.  There is more accurate information about the numbers and the frequency of terror attacks. The chart mentioned above shows that terror attacks reached their peak between 1994 and 1996. At some point, in 1995, the various terror groups were able to launch up to 30 more or less simultaneous attacks each day. In some cases, the terrorists killed hundreds of people in a day, the record being reached with the massacre of an estimated 500 people in the village of Ben-Talha.  In March 1994 during a visit to Algiers it was hard to avoid the impression that the Algerian state was on the verge of collapse and that the terrorists would soon ride into the capital to seize power. The nation had suffered human and physical losses on the scale of a conventional war. The damage done to its economic and administrative infrastructure by the terrorists ran into billions of dollars. Thousands of municipal buildings, schools, clinics, libraries and private homes had been destroyed. Dozens of villages had been turned into desert, their inhabitants driven out or massacred.  By 1996, however, the tide had begun to turn against the terrorists and within a year it was clear that Algeria was no longer in mortal danger. By 1999 Algeria had won its war against terrorism.  A similar story could be told of Peru, the Latin American nation most affected by terrorist war.  At one point, the main terrorist organization known as Sendero Luminoso (The Shining Path) was capable of striking anywhere and anytime it wished. Over almost two decades, the terrorist war claimed the lives of at least30, 000people, mostly civilians. By seizing control of a good chunk of the illicit narcotics trade, the terrorist groups had access to an almost endless source of cash to finance their campaign.  And, yet, by 1999 Peru, too, seemed to be emerging from its ordeal. With Sendero Luminoso flushed out of its safe havens and its leadership in the can, the Peruvian state was able to reassert its authority even in the deepest jungles of the hinterland.  Algeria and Peru are not the only nations to have faced and defeated modern terrorism. Egypt and Turkey have had similar experiences with exceptionally brutal terrorist movements.  Today no fewer than 22 countries are affected by terrorism of one form or another. In some, like India, the Philippines, Thailand and Myanmar, the state has succeeded in containing the terrorist threat without fully defeating it. In others, like Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, terrorism has transformed into low- intensity warfare that could continue for years.  Elsewhere, as in Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast and Uganda terror groups have organized themselves into mini-armies that control large chunks of territory and threaten the central state.  But all these experiences reveal one important fact: No terrorist movement in the past two decades has succeeded in overthrowing the state and seizing power for itself. This is in contrast with the experience of the previous decades that saw several terrorist movements, often disguised as revolutionary guerrilla movements, come to power on a wave of violence.  How did Algeria, Peru and other nations that have defeated terrorism managed to do so in the face of heavy odds?  The question is of interest to the latest victims of terrorism, including Saudi Arabia.  While Algerian, Peruvian and other experiences in fighting terrorism show important differences, they all have several key features in common.  The first of these is a psychological determination on the part of the ruling elites to stay the course. One central aim of the terrorist, of course, is to instill fear in society in general and the elite in particular. By refusing to be frightened, society and its leaders achieve their first victory against the terrorists.  This, of course, is easier said than done. In Algeria, for example, the terrorists launched a campaign of murdering university teachers and students, especially girls. Scores were killed, mostly by having their throats slit. The immediate effect was dramatic. More than half of the students of the Algiers University stayed away for weeks and months. By 1995, however, the authorities had provided enough security to persuade the students, and their teachers, to return. This was still an act of daily courage on the part of tens of thousands of young people who were prepared to risk their lives but not to allow terrorists to close the universities.  In both Peru and Algeria the authorities started by grouping key personalities of the system in fortified neighborhoods so as to protect them against assassination attempts. But they soon realized that this made the task of the terrorists easier. The terrorists, using a few people for surveillance, could chart the movements of all the key people to and from a small area. This gave them fixed targets while they themselves enjoyed maximum mobility.  The terrorists achieved spectacular successes by killing many top people. Dozens of ministers, governors, mayors, trade union leaders, political party personalities, prominent media men and women were murdered in Peru and Algeria. In Algeria they even assassinated the head of state.  Later, both countries decided to spread their key personnel widely, beyond the terrorists' capacity to organize surveillance operations leading to assassinations.  The second lesson to learn is to understand the difference in the rhythm and tempo of the terrorist organization and the state security forces. The terrorist is almost always capable of running the100 - meter course faster than his state adversaries. He aims at achieving big victories quickly and with a few spectacular operations. The state security forces, on the other hand, must be prepared to draw the terrorist into a marathon course. They need to slow things down as much as possible and to make sure that even the most spectacular attacks fail to produce the results desired by the terrorists.  The third lesson to learn is the strategy of forcing the terrorists into fixed positions before moving against them. The terrorist constantly seeks anonymity, like fish in water.  But he also needs safe havens, hospitals, recreation centers, places to hide his bigger weapons, and facilities to train new recruits or imprison potential defectors. All this means a loss of mobility, which is the terrorist's key advantage over the state.  In both Algeria and Peru, and to some extent even in Turkey and Egypt, the state decided to actually help the terrorists become fixed targets.  In Algeria, for example, the anti-terror units deliberately stayed out of some areas, notably the Mitidja plain and the town of Blida, thus shooing the terrorists there. On some occasions the security forces even refused to intervene to stop terrorist operations that took place under their noses, so to speak. The idea was to convince the terrorists that they had a safe haven. In time this meant that the terrorists became fixed targets while the security forces enjoyed the advantage of mobility and the choice of the time to attack.  Counterterrorism experts know the fourth lesson as "the onion principle." This means treating the terrorist organizations as bodies constituted by numerous layers. The classical counter terrorist method is to look for the core of the "onion" in the hope of eliminating it. But in both Peru and Algeria, it soon became clear that it was more efficient to deal with the outer layers first.  These outer layers provide finance, information, surveillance, espionage and a variety of logistical support for the core groups. Thus disrupting or destroying them would have a direct impact on the efficiency of the core groups.  Dealing with the outer layer is also important because they offer opportunities for misinformation campaigns and, more importantly, infiltration. This method was most successfully used in Egypt where the authorities managed to infiltrate virtually all terror groups, at times right to the highest levels of their leadership.

That's the key question, which the New York Times has once again failed to answer, this time in an otherwise informative story by Greg Myre ("Israel Says Children Enlist Children as Suicide Bombers", June 13,2004).  While Myre pulls no punches when it comes to telling readers how Palestinian children are now recruiting their classmates and cousins to become suicide bombers, he shies away from telling readers why Palestinian kids have taken up this grisly task.   In Myre's rendition the child recruitment is a mystery - he reports only that "some Palestinian leaders have condemned the use of teenagers, and opposition to the practice is widespread among ordinary Palestinians..." Could the Palestinian kids have been indoctrinated in their schools? Myre casts doubt on this, reporting at face value the claims of one Palestinian school official that he tries to keep politics out of the classroom, "This place is for education and we don't want to talk about politics."  Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Far from being opposed to child suicide bombers, Palestinian society and Palestinian leaders revel in child "martyrdom," and the Palestinian media and schools do all they can to encourage a cult of death among children. The paramount Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, for example, stated in an interview on Palestinian TV that: "... this child who is grasping the stone, facing the tank, is it not the greatest message to the world when that hero becomes a shahid [martyr]? We are proud of them..." (PATV, Jan. 15, 2002 cited in Ask for Death, Palestinian Media Watch.)  While Arafat's words certainly carry weight among Palestinian children, perhaps the most effective recruitment tool has been music videos, which are broadcast for hours on end by official Palestinian television (there is no independent television under Arafat's rule). The videos are a call to death and martyrdom for Palestinian children, promising the glories and pleasures of heaven to the young "warriors for Allah":  "How sweet is the fragrance of the shahids, how sweet is the scent of the earth, its thirst quenched by the gush of blood flowing from the youthful body." (Quoted by Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crook in the Jerusalem Post, January 29, 2004)  Another music video also aimed at children and broadcast repeatedly told young viewers that:  "Oh, young ones: Shake the earth, raise the stones. You will not be saved, O Zionist, from the volcano of my country's stones.  You are the target of my eyes, I will even willingly fall as a shahid [martyr for Allah].   Allahu akbar [god is great]! Oh, young ones!" (Quoted by Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crook in the Jerusalem Post, June 2, 2004).  Yet another music video shown repeatedly on Palestinian TV centered on a Palestinian child who had been killed at the start of the present violence in October 2000. A young actor portrays the child in paradise, flying a kite and running on the beach, and encouraging other Palestinian children to follow him in martyrdom, "I am waving to you not in parting, but to say, 'Follow me.' "  (Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crook in the National Post, April 8, 2004). As for the claim that Palestinian parents oppose such suicide bombings, news reports, including in the Times, indicate the opposite. For example, a few months ago Myre's colleague James Bennet reported that "Many Palestinian parents have praised their sons and daughters for carrying out suicide attacks, hailing them as heroes and martyrs." (New York Times, March 25, 2004)  Palestinian support and encouragement for child suicide bombers is an ugly reality. The Times' reluctance to deal with this ugly reality will help only to perpetuate it.

        HIGHLIGHTS   U.S.A.  – POLITICAL AFFAIRS   Impeachment process was illegitimate: Clinton   Former President Bill Clinton has called his fight against impeachment a "badge of honour" and his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky "morally indefencible" in a CBS television interview.   In the hour-long interview on CBS 60 Minutes to be telecasted on Sunday, two days before publication of his memoir My Life, Clinton said he was proud of his successful fight against impeachment, the network said in excerpts released on Wednesday.  "I didn't quit, I never thought of resigning and I stood up to it and beat it back," he said.  "The whole battle was a badge of honour. I don't see it as a stain, because it (the impeachment process) was illegitimate," added Clinton, who called the process "an abuse of power."  Clinton's more than 900-page memoir, published by Alfred A Knopf, hits book stores on June 22.  He told 60 Minutes that high on his list of regrets was his affair with Lewinsky, which he called "a terrible moral error."  Clinton said his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, were able to overcome the effect of the revelation of the affair through counselling.  The former president said Hillary needed time with him to decide whether she would stay married to him.  "We'd take a day a week, and we did - a whole day a week every week for a year, maybe a little more - and did counselling," said Clinton. "We did it together. We did it individually. We did family work."  Clinton said there was no rational explanation for his adulterous behaviour.   "I did something for the worst possible reason. Just because I could," the former president said. "I think that's just about the most morally indefencible reason anybody could have for doing anything."  Clinton also discussed other issues during the interview, including the war on terror and Osama bin Laden and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and regretted his failure to convince Yasser Arafat to accept a proposal he thought could finally bring Middle East peace, CBS said.

Used for what is commonly known as "jamming," the Improved Capabilities System III (ICAP III) overloads specific hostile communication bandwidths, causing users to temporarily lose service.   "Training and testing of ICAP III is a stepping-stone for the Navy," said Chief Aviation Structural Mechanic Ron Szpynda, Air Test Evaluation (VX) 9.  "This is the first time we have used this system."   VX-9's EA-6B Prowlers are being used to test the system. The aircraft provides protection for strike aircraft, ground troops and ships, by jamming enemy radar, electronic data links and communications.  "The system floods an opposing bandwidth with more frequency than those operating systems release," said Cmdr. Jim Winship, VX-9 branch head. "This causes users to temporarily lose service. Everything from telephones to sophisticated electronic equipment goes static, because the jammer can overwhelm the frequencies they use."   More than 9,000 Navy, Marine, Air Force and Coast Guard service members from units stationed in the continental United States and the Pacific theater have come to Alaska to participate in the joint training exercise.

The 10-minute arraignment drew about 30 protesters to the federal courthouse in Trenton, and prompted the U.S. Marshal's Office to heighten security in and around the building. But the demonstration was peaceful and the court proceeding ended without incident.  The defendants, members of the group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, were indicted last month on charges of conspiring to commit animal enterprise terrorism, an offense punishable by three years in prison. Prosecutors contend the defendants encouraged and in some cases planned attacks to intimidate the research company Huntingdon Life Sciences, its clients or associates.   Huntingdon uses thousands of animals - mainly rats, but also dogs and monkeys - to conduct product safety tests each year for its clients, primarily pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers. The company is based in London, but performs most of the tests at a laboratory in Franklin Township, Somerset County.   In 1999, opponents formed SHAC and vowed to shut down the company. The indictment contends the group posted an online list of "Top 20 Terror Tactics" that encouraged attacks, threatening letters and phone calls, e-mail "bombs" to crash computers and home invasions against Huntingdon employees and business associates. Most of the actual incidents alleged to have occurred were acts of vandalism.   The charges represents a rare prosecution under a federal law enacted to respond to what critics said was an upsurge in violent animal rights activity. Members of such groups say the prosecution could be a test case for how far the government can go in policing activism.   U.S. District Judge Mary Cooper tentatively set an Aug. 17 trial date, but attorneys said they probably will ask for an extension.   Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles McKenna, who is prosecuting the case, said the evidence includes phone wiretaps and surveillance that yielded 440 audiocassettes and 50 videotapes. He told the judge that the case, "in many aspects, isn't the standard case."   Five of the seven defendants had lived until recently in central New Jersey, not far from the Huntingdon lab. The others hail from Long Island and Washington State. Almost all are in their mid-20s.   One, Darius Fullmer, is a paramedic. Another, John McGee, is a first-year law school student at Rutgers University. A third, Andrew Stepanian, was a student at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University, his attorney said last month. The others - Kevin Kjonaas, Lauren Gazzola, Jacob Conroy and Joshua Harper - are "social justice volunteers," according to online statements from the group.   Each entered identical not-guilty pleas yesterday. They declined to discuss the case, but are planning a multistate speaking tour to highlight their arrests.   Cooper approved court-appointed attorneys for each, but several private defense attorneys said after the hearing that they plan to ask the judge to let them represent the defendants for free.   "This case is about First Amendment practices in the 21st century, the use of modern technology, the freedom to use Web sites to speak for any cause," said Andrew Erba, a Cherry Hill attorney who said he has represented civil rights groups before. Erba said he expected to represent Kjonaas, 26, who calls himself the president of SHAC-USA.   Attorney Daniel Perez said he has advised Gazzola for more than a year and intends to represent her at trial. Perez said the group did nothing more than advocate protection for laboratory animals.   "All these people are really accused of is running a Web site that reports on the activities of the animal rights movement and supports direct action," Perez said. "They did not engage in illegal activity. They exercised their rights to free speech. So when I read the indictment, my reaction is, where's the beef? Or maybe I should say: Where's the tofu?"   The free speech issue was a favorite for the protesters who toted signs and chanted slogans for about an hour before yesterday's hearing. Armed U.S. Marshals ringed the building, with riot gear stored inside the entrance alcove just in case.   "I came here because this is a travesty of justice," said David Lambon, 31, of Norristown, Pa. Lambon said he was an independent activist and a college student "between schools."   "This case is about more than just SHAC," said Camille Hankins of New York Animal Rights Activists, who led chants outside the courthouse with a bullhorn yesterday. "It's about the right to engage in community activism everywhere."   Source;  Star-Ledger, June 04  Write;  by John P. Martin and Brian T. Murray. John P.

The commission, which presented new findings as it conducted its 12th round of hearings in Washington, said the Al-Qaeda chief continued his links with the region even when he moved to Sudan in 1991.  "Al-Qaeda had never entirely left the region, even when headquartered in Sudan, it had used Pakistan and Afghanistan as a regional base and training centre supporting Islamic insurgencies in Tajikistan, Kashmir, and Chechnya," said one of the two reports that commission investigators, introduced at the ongoing hearings.  Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan in May 1996, and as soon as the Taliban, a Pakistan-backed Afghan faction seized control of Kabul in 1996, he began building close relations with them.  "Pakistan did not break with the Taliban until after 9/11, although it was well aware that it was harbouring bin Laden," the report said.  "The Taliban's ability to provide Bin Laden a haven in the face of international pressure and UN sanctions was significantly facilitated by Pakistani support. Pakistan benefited from the Taliban-Al-Qaeda relationship, as Bin Laden's camps trained and equipped fighters for Pakistan's ongoing struggle with India over Kashmir."  The training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan provided multifaceted skills to Islamic terrorists because a worldwide jihad needed terrorists who could bomb embassies, hijack airliners, or provide foot soldiers for the Taliban, "and guerrillas who could shoot down Russian helicopters in Chechnya or ambush Indian units in Kashmir," noted the report.  Furthermore, it said, Al-Qaeda had a worldwide network of recruiters and travel facilitators, and "there are strong indications that elements of both the Pakistani and Iranian governments frequently turned a blind eye to this transit through their respective countries."  The two statements of findings by the commission also reveal other aspects of the war on terrorism that may impinge on Bush's presidency.  The reports said specifically that the commission could not find any substantive link between Al-Qaeda and the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussain.  The report also noted that bin Laden did not have any personal fortune of $300 million, a much touted number in the past, to support his activities. Rather, he raised the money through the network of charities and fundraisers and used the 'hawala', an informal method to move money around the world.  "Bin Laden relied on the established hawala networks operating in Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and throughout the Middle East to transfer funds efficiently," the report stated.

The warning, from President Mohammad Khatami, came as the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna prepared to adopt a resolution strongly critical of perceived continuing Iranian attempts to block and deceive the inspectors.   "We had, we have and we will have, a nuclear programme to enrich uranium to produce fuel," said Mr Khatami - in what is a blow to Britain, Germany and France, which last year struck a widely hailed deal for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment.   "With the ongoing trend, we have no moral commitment any more to suspend uranium enrichment," Mr Khatami said.   There has been discontent in the EU - and more visibly in the US - at the Iranian approach since it agreed to suspend enrichment. The IAEA says the country has continued to make equipment and refine crude uranium for the enrichment programme.

If the government gets its way, even routine transactions of buying or selling American homes could soon come under the scrutiny of money-laundering provisions of the USA Patriot Act. The Treasury Department, which already has caught up financial transactions in casinos, storefront check-cashing stores and auto dealers for scrutiny, wants to expand Patriot Act coverage to home purchases as well.  Since 9/11, critics say the greatest effect of new state and federal antiterrorism laws has been on crimes already covered by other laws.  Washington-area snipers John Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo were both convicted under a post-9/11 Virginia antiterrorism statute making it a death-penalty offense to be involved in more than one murder in a three-year period. Muhammad was sentenced to death, and Malvo was given life imprisonment without parole.  The FBI has used Patriot Act provisions in a political corruption probe involving a Las Vegas girlie bar, and the Justice Department reported to the House Judiciary Committee last year that it used the new law in probes of credit-card fraud, theft from a bank account and a kidnapping.  In the first action of its kind, the Treasury Department also used the Patriot Act this year to put Syria's largest commercial bank and two commercial banks in Myanmar on blacklists actions that forbid any U.S. financial institution from doing business with them.  Legal experts say they're not surprised that antiterrorism laws are being used for more than just terrorism.  Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University, recalled that Congress adopted antiracketeering laws in 1970 with the intent to thwart mobsters, but the punitive laws have since been broadened and put to use in civil cases against corporations, and most recently against the organized campaigns of pro-life protesters against abortion clinics.  Swire worked in the Clinton administration and chaired a White House working group looking at issues involved with electronic surveillance. He said many Patriot Act provisions, which sped through Congress within days after 9/11, were proposals that either Congress or the White House had previously rejected. Many provisions are slated to expire next year unless Congress makes the changes permanent.  Swire said one little-noted impact of that law on the judicial system is that prosecutors can add more charges against defendants, even when terrorism isn't involved.  "Prosecutors like to have more arrows in their quiver it gives them more leverage in plea bargaining," he said. Plea bargaining is the process where prosecutors offer to drop some charges in return for a defendant's guilty plea in order to avoid costly, time-consuming trials.  Swire contends the Patriot Act has been so controversial that the Justice Department has been very cautious in using all of its provisions.  "They are careful because they know people are checking to see if it is abused," he said. "Once it becomes permanent, I think it will be used more widely."  The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups are campaigning for Congress to terminate some of the more controversial provisions of the Patriot Act, contending the law unnecessarily expands government powers.  The ACLU says the government already has sufficient investigative tools, and the Patriot Act has been used for non-terrorist-related crimes such as seizing stolen funds from bank accounts in Belize.  Michael Mello, a law professor at Vermont Law School, disagrees and said the Patriot Act made some needed changes in government procedures, including provisions that tore down barriers that prohibited the FBI and CIA from sharing information.  "There's been a sea change by tearing down that wall," said Mello. "To forbid the FBI from getting spooks' (CIA) information that someone in the United States was carrying out a significant criminal enterprise is insane."  In spite of the criticism from the ACLU and others, Mello said he doesn't believe the Patriot Act has been misused or has resulted in any expansion of government powers. "In the absence of evidence, the critics lose," he said.  Mello agrees that there are some provisions in the Patriot Act that should be allowed to expire. He opposes a controversial provision allowing the Justice Department to use so-called "national security letters" to obtain library records, medical records and banking records of people put under surveillance. The Patriot Act wasn't needed when police searched library records in the hunt for Unabomber Ted Kaczynski or the effort to track New York's Zodiac killer, Mello noted.  Many government activities under the Patriot Act remain shrouded in secrecy. One of the provisions not expiring is an expansion of police powers to obtain "sneak-and-peek" warrants allowing surveillances - including break-ins - without notifying the people being watched.  The government is being more aggressive in asking courts for surveillance warrants. The Justice Department last year made a record 1,727 requests for wiretap approvals from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but does not publicly disclose how many investigations that might involve.  Attorney General John Ashcroft told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that the Patriot Act has been used judiciously, and he urged Congress to give speedy consideration to extending it.

But court president Fawwaz Bakur commuted the sentence against the only one in court, Jordanian Ahmad al-Rayati, to seven and a half years with hard labour "to give him a chance to improve himself and because he is a bread-winner", the court said.  Riyati, 35, was among 15 people on trial since October. Eight of the absentees were also given 15 years but one was killed in a shootout in April.  The remaining six, all Jordanians who lived in Iran, had died under mysterious circumstances and in an unidentified location, prosecutors said in March, and Bakur dropped charges against them.  One of the absentees sentenced is Najm al-Din Faraj Ahmad, also known as Mullah Krekar, the founder of Ansar al-Islam, or Supporters of Islam, who has been cleard in Norway of charges of funding terrorism and inciting murder.  Al-Rayati was specifically charged with having received military training in Afghanistan and training others in Tehran to "prepare poisons and produce explosives for assassinating heads of the Jordanian intelligence service".  He was arrested by US troops in Iraqi Kurdistan during the US-led war on Iraq in March 2003 and extradited to Jordan.   Norwegian inquiry  Al-Rayati denied all the charges against him and interrupted the verdict by shouting at the court.  "I am not a criminal. You are the criminals," he said, adding that he wanted to leave Jordan to live in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip.  Mullah Krekar is on a US list of terrorist organisations, alleged by Washington to be linked to al-Qaida and having mounted attacks on US-led forces in Iraq.  "I am not a criminal. You are the criminals" Ahmad al-Rayati, defendant in state security court trial  On Tuesday Norwegian prosecutors in Oslo dropped their case against Krekar citing lack of evidence, but the United States said it still had serious concerns about him.  He had been the target of a Norwegian police inquiry since September 2002. Among other allegations he is suspected of involvement in a conspiracy to murder Kurdish political rivals and funding of "terrorist" organisations.  But Krekar, who has been living in exile in Norway since 1991, still faces an expulsion order for posing a threat to national security and violating his residency permit by returning to Iraq several times.  He founded Ansar al-Islam in December 2001, although he insists he has not led the group since May 2002 and denied all the charges against him.  Ansar al-Islam used to control a small group in northeastern Iraq before U.S forces pushed it out in late March last year. It then allegedly had between 700 and 900 members.

Chirac is just the latest in a line of Frenchmen that has given the United States a long and seemingly unending, migraine headache.   As President Bush sat on the podium with Mr. Chirac - who was looking pompous as only Chirac can - it was obvious by the body language of the president that he would rather have been having a root canal done without Novocain than be sitting next to this man, Chirac, who reeks of arrogance and delusions of grandeur and needs to be frisked for the knife he always buries in the back of American presidents. While Bush did what was expected of him, giving the French leader due respect, Chirac seemed to feel no need to return the favor, even publicly.   There was a time, of course, when France was important. That was a long, long time ago and somewhere along the line France got the reputation of being just a tad quick to surrender to enemies. Has France had a great leader since Napoleon?   You might ask: "What about the French Foreign Legion?" Well, it that seems no French are allowed in the French Foreign Legion. Perhaps that's why it is so feared.   It has been said that we wouldn't have won the Revolutionary War without help from the French. The war may have lasted a year longer, but would the war have been lost without our "good friends" the French? What were the French after? Did they help us out of the goodness of their hearts or did they just want to poke a stick in the eye of their nemeses, the Brits?   Americans are even insulted by the French in Canada. The French Canadians tried to tear Canada apart and become a separate country, loyal to France and not England. French Canadians want to be independent, but prefer to sing the praises of the great French culture instead acknowledging Canada's English roots. It must drive French Canadians crazy that the Queen is on Canadian money and still honored after all these years. Canada's last president from the French providences, Jean Joseph Jacques Chretien, loved France so much that he named his first child, France. Chretien's loathing of the United States was very apparent every time he spoke. Following Mother France's socialist course, Chretien also destroyed Canada's military and ran their economy into the ground paying for social programs. It is unknown if Canada's military inherited the surrender gene from the French or the strong fighting gene from the English. Perhaps it depends on what part of Canada the soldier hails from.  The world met the great French leader and general, Charles De Gaulle, in the 1940's. De Gaulle received his promotion to general in the field and when his country collapsed and surrendered to Nazi Germany, De Gaulle fled to England. In France, as in most countries, promotions to that level must be approved by the government, but France's government had gone the way of the Dodo, so De Gaulle just "forgot" to tell anyone that his high rank was not official. De Gaulle set about becoming the de facto French leader in England by driving Winston Churchill crazy.   Churchill kept De Gaulle busy by giving him control of the 1st Free French division which was made up of whatever flotsam and jetsam the British leader could dig up or have released from prison early. De Gaulle was kept away from any real war plans as the Allied leaders sent him and his band of criminals here and there, usually somewhere in a flank position because anywhere else "General" De Gaulle got in the way of the real soldiers.  De Gaulle drove General Eisenhower to distraction. De Gaulle was never happy that the American general was chosen to be the supreme commander in Europe. De Gaulle, of course, felt that honor should be his. The free world can thank God everyday that De Gaulle was not leading anything. He was consulted out of political respect and the knowledge that he would probably lead France after the war but that was the only reason. De Gaulle felt D-Day would be a disaster and would never be successful. That was just one just one in a long string of De Gaulle's opinions that were wrong.  After the Allied forces liberated France, De Gaulle was allowed to "liberate" Paris with his nonexistent army. This man, with his supreme ego, probably believed he really did liberate Paris. It was all political, of course, and General Patton was left grinding his teeth over the slight.  General George Patton, a great general known to be a little pompous himself, said he would rather have a battalion of Germans in front of him than a battalion of French behind him. Patton had a big mouth, but at least he had the skills in warfare to back up his ego.   De Gaulle did become the leader of France after World War II and in the 1960's decided French soil could no longer stand having American soldiers standing on it so he pulled out of the military branch of NATO and ordered all American troops out of France. An angry President Johnson asked De Gaulle if he wanted us to dig up our dead and remove them as well. The story goes that a sputtering De Gaulle told him he didn't mean THOSE American soldiers.  In the here and now, Chirac proudly carries on the French anti-American tradition. However, Chirac has taken it to new heights. Saddam Hussein was a longtime good friend of Chirac, and Saddam thought right up until the first bomb dropped that his good friend in France would keep him safe from the Americans. Saddam should have known that the French always promise more then they can deliver.   As irritating as France's active support of Saddam was prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom, the revelation that France, along with Germany and Russia and the United Nations were lining their pockets off the blood of Iraqi children does not seem to fall into the category of "friend and ally." The fact that our soldiers have been killed with weapons sold to Saddam by France and other "friends" is more than irritating, it's infuriating - considering the current attitude of the French Government.   The latest insult was Chirac's refusal to attend President Ronald Reagan's funeral. Already in the States for the G-8 conference, Chirac flatly refused to attend the funeral and, at first, was not even going to send a representative. After some protests from the French press, Chirac decided to send an underling. Could it be that Chirac is jealous of Reagan for doing what France could not? Reagan brought down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union - something the mighty French thought was impossible.  Admit it. The average American would just like to smack Chirac every time his face is shown on the television screen. Chirac and the French use the U.N. to hang on to what little power France has left, and the fact the United States can survive quite nicely without any help from France just drives the French crazy. How dare the United States be so darn successful!   As France's economy tanks, the United States economy grows. As the French military perfects the art of surrender, our military doesn't know the meaning of the word. As "new Europe" looks to the United States for guidance - and not France - its pride is hurt. Didn't the world get the memo from God stating that France should be the leader of the world?   The world seems to have missed that memo - or read it, laughed, and threw it away.

Jean Ziegler, the United Nations' special expert on the right to food, said he forwarded a letter to Caterpillar chief executive James Owen expressing concern "about the actions of the Israeli occupation forces in Rafah and in other locations in Gaza and the West Bank."  According to The AP, Ziegler said his letter was the first under a new resolution passed earlier this year by the 53-country UN Human Rights Commission extending responsibility for protecting rights beyond governments to "non-state actors."   Ziegler wrote to Owen under the letterhead of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the overall UN watchdog, and sent his letter on his own as he is entitled to do, a spokesman said.   The Israelis are "using armoured bulldozers supplied by your company to destroy agricultural farms, greenhouses, ancient olive groves and agricultural fields planted with crops," the May 28 letter said.   Ziegler, a Swiss university professor, told The Associated Press that he had yet to receive a response from the company.   "Allowing the delivery of your D-9 and D-10 Caterpillar bulldozers to the Israeli army through the government of the United States in the certain knowledge that they are being used for such actions might involve complicity or acceptance on the part of your company to actual and potential violations of human rights, including the right to food," Ziegler wrote in his letter.   The Israelis have also used the bulldozers to destroy "numerous Palestinian homes and sometimes human lives, including that of the American peace activist Rachel Corrie," he said.   Ziegler, appointed by the UN Human Rights Commission, said after a 10-day visit to Gaza and the West Bank last year that Israel was confiscating fertile Palestinian land for military zones or Jewish settlements.   "We saw thousands of olive trees destroyed by bulldozers," he said.

"Be assured that the kingdom has enough men whom you haven't seen so far, but within the coming few days you will see them," Crown Prince Abdullah told the militants, whose attacks have increased during the past three months. His remarks were televised.  Westerners in Saudi Arabia are responding to the attacks by moving to high-security compounds or even to Bahrain, and by pushing for the right to armed private guards, according to diplomats and real estate agents.  Western embassies in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, are negotiating with the government for a relaxation of the ban on private security guards carrying firearms, a Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Some Westerners have expressed concern that terrorist sympathizers may have infiltrated the Saudi security services, the diplomat said.  Security forces arrested a militant Tuesday north of Riyadh as they stepped up their presence in and around the city in a hunt for the kidnappers of Paul Johnson, an American who was abducted Saturday by a group calling itself al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  Security officials said the militant was detained in the King Fahd district, but it was not immediately clear whether the detainee was connected to the recent terror attacks.  Johnson, 49, of Stafford Township, N.J., was employed by Lockheed Martin and worked on Apache helicopters.   Third Westerner Killed  The day he was seized, Islamic militants shot dead another American, Kenneth Scroggs, from Laconia, N.H., in his garage. Scroggs was the third Westerner killed in a week, after the shooting death of an Irish cameraman for the British Broadcasting Corp. on June 6 and another American who was killed in his garage June 8.  Soldiers with automatic rifles guarded government buildings and manned check points in the city on Tuesday. Other security forces were searching houses where Johnson might be held, a Saudi official said, speaking on a condition of anonymity.  The Interior Ministry set up a hot line to receive information about Johnson or possible terrorist attacks.  In his appearance on television, the crown prince addressed a group of writers, intellectuals and clerics, urging them to take a proactive position against Islamic militancy.  "What is required from you as brothers, as clerics, as writers, is not to be silent," Abdullah said. "Silence is a crime against your religion, against your country and against your people."  The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh has advised Americans to leave Saudi Arabia, and Britain has authorized the voluntary departure of its nonessential embassy staff and their families.  "There is no overcrowding at consulates and there is no panic among Westerners to leave," a Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  An estimated 35,000 Americans have been working in Saudi Arabia. It was not clear how many have left since the terror attacks became more frequent in April. Western diplomats said Monday that Americans and others were leaving in response to the violence, but that it could not be described as an exodus.  A real estate agent in Riyadh told The Associated Press that Westerners were moving from parts of the capital seen as less secure to walled compounds and upscale neighborhoods with greater security.  "They will feel safer as more security forces are deployed (in those areas)," the real estate agent said, speaking on a condition of anonymity.  Foreigners who work in the oil industry, and live on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia, have even crossed international borders to sleep soundly.  "Foreigners working in the oil industry have been renting houses in neighboring Bahrain," a second real estate agent told the AP. "They finish their work and come back the next day."  Bahrain is just a 30-minute drive across the 18-mile King Fahd Causeway from eastern Saudi Arabia.

Both measures grew out of events in Iraq, where some American companies have been accused of overcharging the government for goods and services, and where employees of private companies have been implicated in the prison abuse scandal.  Opponents said the proposals could disrupt military operations in Iraq and impair American intelligence and supply efforts. The plan to bar private interrogators within 90 days and translators within a year was rejected on a 54-43 vote; the tougher criminal penalties - of as much as 20 years – were defeated 52-46. If adopted, both would have been added to a major Pentagon bill now being debated in the Senate.  Senators approved an alternative Republican plan to extend current domestic antifraud laws to those operating overseas and, on a voice vote, adopted a declaration that those held in American custody should not be subject to torture.   Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he feared the proposal to allow jail terms of up to 20 years for those found to have "materially overvalued" goods and services could deter companies from seeking work in Iraq. He said such a step required more consideration.  "I think the Congress should deliberate very carefully a criminal penalty of up to 20 years for these thousands upon thousands of companies that are currently engaged," he said.  But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said current prohibitions did not seem to deter companies from charging excessive prices. "We constantly pick up the paper about a number of these companies that are obviously overcharging and nothing is happening to them,'' he said. "I am one frustrated American and would like them to stop."

Commission proposal on exchange of information on terrorism could lead to hundreds of innocent people being put on "watch-lists" for each anti-terrorist investigation  - 	Companies, charities and all bank accounts to be targeted  - 	European Criminal Registry to be set up including data on all those charged - whether found guilty or not   At the EU Summit meeting (the 25 Prime Ministers) in Brussels on 17-18 June 2004 will adopt a new Action Plan on terrorism and a series of reports in the wake of 11 March 2004 (Madrid).  A recent detailed analysis of the 57 measures being put forward following 11 March 2004 (Madrid) by the Council of the European Union (the 15 EU governments) and the European Commission. The analysis found that 27 of the measures had little or nothing to do with tackling terrorism including measures to do with crime in general and the surveillance of telecommunications (phone-calls, e-mails, faxes, internet usage) and of movement. This strategy begs the question whether there is, at the highest level, a confusion of aims and effort.  The Action Plans for the Summit (from the Council of the Europe Union and the European Commission) are peppered with references to a Commission Communication dated 29 March 2004, which is a classic demonstration of confused aims. This contains a proposal for a Council Decision on exchanging "information and cooperation concerning terrorists offences" (see below) and a "wish-list" on criminal matters. The logic is to bring together the: "Union's arsenal of weapons against terrorism. Many of these are not specifically anti-terrorism but range wider while including terrorism [and] a link should be established between terrorism and other forms of crime" [even though these are] not always immediately obvious..if the fight against terrorism is to be totally effective, it must be handled in conjunction with the fight against other forms of crime."  It argues that the connection is, in part, through the use of "similar" methods and proposes everybody’s (convicted criminal or not) bank accounts should be "registered" and "be accessible to law enforcement agencies". Companies and charitable organisations too are to be targeted because they could be "infiltrated" by terrorists. Everyone, across whole spheres of everyday life, are to registered and recorded to try and track down terrorist "suspects" - of course, the same information - once collected and accessible to a host of state agencies - could equally be used for other purposes which have nothing to do with terrorism.  The big project is the proposed creation of a "European Criminal Record" to be held on a "European Criminal Registry" - which according to a Commission spokesperson would contain not only all convictions and disqualifications but also all charges brought (even of those found innocent at trial) from the whole of the EU - in "the fight against crime, and in particular terrorism".  The simplistic notion in the Commission Communication is that there is an intrinsic link between terrorism and organised crime and indeed all crime - an argument which, if turned around, implies that all crime is linked to terrorism.  Framework Decision: exchanging information  The specific proposal in the Communication is a draft Council Decision on "the exchange of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences". This envisages in Article 2 the exchange of "information" during investigations and prosecutions concerning terrorist offences as set out in Article 1 to 3 of the 2002 Framework Decision on combating terrorism. The "information" is to be communicated to Europol and Eurojust (EU prosecutors) and made "available immediately to the authorities of other interested Member States".  It is sensible that such information should be made available. However, the proposal contains no provision for the "information" to be removed/deleted should a person be found innocent. There is no provision for the "information" passed over on those caught up in a "criminal investigation" but never charged or convicted to be removed/deleted. This is especially worrying as an "investigation" into a suspected terrorist offence would embrace not just the subject but their family, friends and work associates to see if there were any links to the suspected offence. A typical investigation could involve 20-40 other people who are found to be quite innocent but "information" on them could be "immediately" transmitted to dozens of agencies across the 25 EU member states.  In April ten Muslim "suspects" were arrested in the north of England but never charged - this could have led to several hundred names and personal details being put into EU-wide circulation with no obligation for this data to be deleted. If there is no obligation to delete the names and details of innocent people they could find themselves on "watch-lists" for years to come.  There is another problem with the draft Decision. The intention is to widen the scope from those persons, groups and entities placed on updated lists of terrorist groups on formally adopted EU lists to all those investigated under Articles 1 to 3 of the controversial Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2002) which, despite some amendment, is still ambiguous as to where the line is drawn between terrorism and large-scale protests. It covers, for example, those acting with the aim of: unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act (Art 1.ii)  To broaden the scope of cooperation on terrorism to this much broader definition open the way for abuse and its application to non-terrorist offences.   Comment:  "The increasing tendency to stress the "anti-terrorist" benefits of crime control and wholesale surveillance measures shows a confusion of aims which detracts from the clear need to protect people from terrorist attacks. This has to be one of the most confused and illogical Commission Communications ever produced. It should be withdrawn and be re-presented and deal only with investigations into terrorist offences - and include absolute safeguards for those innocently caught up in them."

Know your enemy.    Well, the principal that holds for military warfare holds true for digital warfare, as well. But it's not like black hat hackers are having lunch with security administrators and sharing their secrets for intrusions and hybrid worm attacks. So how do you figure out who your enemy is and what he's trying to do to your network?   The answers lie in the honeypot. According to members of the Honeynet Project and the Honeynet Research Alliance, most of what you need to know about hackers can be found there. Their new collaborative book, Know Your Enemy: Learning About Security Threats looks at honeypots, honeynets and what they can teach us about the bad guys, as well as how to successfully set them up yourself.   Honeypots, which have been around for about 12 years but are gaining interest and momentum, are digital decoys, of sorts. They are built to be probed and attacked -- an online come-on to blackhat hackers. Once the honeypot is attacked, security administrators can watch how the hacker moves around the system, and she can see what tools the hacker is using and what information he's going after.    It's a way to spy on your enemy.    And if you're lucky, it might even be a form of camouflage. Hackers could be fooled into thinking they've accessed a corporate network, when actually they're just banging around in a honeypot - while the real network remains safe and sound.   There also are honeynets, which are a network of honeypots, loaded up with real hardware, like Linux boxes, Cisco switches, Windows NT and Solaris. Lance Spitzner, a senior security architect at Sun Microsystems Inc., created the Honeynet Project with the help of about 30 other security professionals.   Spitzner is one of the authors of the book Know Your Enemy. He talked about what they've learned about hackers, what companies should be doing to better protect themselves, and if putting together a honeypot or a honeynet is the right thing for most companies.   There also are honeynets, which are a network of honeypots, loaded up with real hardware, like Linux boxes, Cisco switches, Windows NT and Solaris. Lance Spitzner, an engineer at Sun Microsystems Inc., created the Honeynet Project with the help of about 30 other security professionals.    Q:  Are honeypots and honeynets the best way to learn about hackers?   It's definitely one of the best ways. You get to watch them operate in their own environment. It's difficult to survey hackers or talk with them... With a honeynet, you can watch and analyze what they're doing without them knowing they're being watched. What tools do they use? What systems are they going after? Who are they communicating with?    Q:  What are some of the more interesting things you've learned about hackers? The attackers and threats are far more aggressive and active than most people think. The typical home user, if they have a dedicated connection to the Internet, is getting scanned about 10 times a day. People think they only go after major companies, but they go after everyone.   And people think of hacker terrorism but most hackers are just criminals. They're out to make money. There are so many creative ways to make money hacking computers. They can go online and take information, like addresses and social security numbers, off peoples' computers. Then they can use the information or sell it. They might even break into hundreds or thousands of computers and sell these hacked computers to someone else. They might set up a porn site on your computer and charge people to go see it.    Q:  What changes have you seen in how hackers operate? There have been two big changes. In '97, '98 or '99, you'd see the misguided youth. But in past few years, there's been a switch to the criminal. People are out to make money. Tools are far more aggressive and automated. It makes for a different level of sophistication.    Q:  What should administrators and CSOs know about your findings? Stay with the basics. People try to go for the latest and greatest. If you're running a current and patched operating system, you should be protected. Anti-virus software and firewalls will go a long way to eliminating most threats. It's not that hackers have super secret weapons. They're trying to look for mistakes in your environment. They look for simple passwords or systems that aren't patched. With 20 percent effort, you can eliminate 80 percent of the threat.    Q:  Should companies be running their own honeypots or honeynets? Commercial organizations? Probably not. Do the basics. If you're having problems with patching and such, you shouldn't have a honeynet. If you've got all the basics done, sure. Go ahead. Get a honeynet because you can learn a lot. But academics, military and government run most honeynets. Stick to what you have to do first. Once you've got the basics down, honeynets can give you a lot of information, maybe even on internal threats.    Q:  What should companies do to protect themselves that they're generally not doing? Companies are not doing the basics. Most want to pass audit. They want to be able to tell shareholders that they're secure... In a lot of cases, you hear about companies being taken out by worms. These exploits have been known for six months and the patches have been out for six months. That means these companies haven't patched their systems in six months. That's just blowing it on the basics.

Concern over this notwithstanding, Malaysia and Indonesia are fiercely opposed to US policing of the body of water that lies between them. They have, however, signaled interest in cooperating with Washington on certain issues to enhance maritime security in this strategic waterway.   The terrorist threat to the Malacca Straits topped the agenda at a recent high-level conference in Singapore, which saw a narrowing in the gap between the positions of the United States and Singapore on the one hand and Malaysia and Indonesia on the other, with regard to measures to step up security in the Straits.  In March, Admiral Thomas Fargo, head of the US Pacific Command, put forward in Congress an initiative to work with Southeast Asian countries to protect the Malacca Straits. The Regional Maritime Security Initiative that Fargo outlined envisaged mutual intelligence gathering and joint patrolling of the waterway. Fargo indicated that the initiative would involve US elite troops who could "take action when the decision has been made to do so".  While Singapore embraced the initiative, Malaysia and Indonesia rejected the proposal as an infringement of their sovereignty. "I think we can look after our own area," Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told the media last month. At the conference, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak, who also serves as defense minister, said the use of US forces in Southeast Asia to fight terrorism would fuel Islamic fanaticism in the region and should be avoided as it would be a setback in the region's ideological battle against extremism and militancy.  Subsequently, Razak told the Malay-language Mingguan Malaysia newspaper: "The presence of foreign troops in our waters would trigger public anger and breathe new life into terrorist groups."  Articulating the Indonesian position on the proposed deployment of US forces, Nugroho Wisnumurti, a former director general for political affairs in the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote in April in the Jakarta Post that the deployment of foreign marines and special operations forces in Indonesia's territorial waters could harm the country's national interests” even if the aim is to fight terrorism". He also pointed out that "the deployment of foreign forces in our territory, including in our territorial waters", would run counter to "one of the basic principles of Indonesian foreign policy, the policy of non-alignment".  "However well intentioned that plan might be, the US plan would not serve the best interests of the countries concerned in fostering regional cooperation to fight terrorism. There should be other ways to reach the same objectives. It is also desirable that the countries concerned should be consulted before any effort to fight terrorism in Southeast Asia is made public," the former diplomat wrote. Singapore, in contrast, had no reservations over the involvement of the Americans in policing the Straits. And Singapore will also work with India, South Korea and other nations to enhance security in the Straits. Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said this week: "One of the major issues which we will discuss with South Korea is involvement by South Koreans in maritime security. The Singapore armed forces has interactions with the Korean military from time to time. We hope to expand and deepen these interactions."  Connecting the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, the Malacca Straits are one of the busiest ocean highways in the world. An estimated 50,000 ships are said to pass through the waterway a year - more than double the number that crosses the Suez Canal and nearly three times the number of ships that use the Panama Canal.  A terrorist strike in the 630-mile-long Malacca Straits would severely dislocate world trade for months. A quarter of the world's commerce passes through this waterway, including 10 million barrels of crude oil heading daily from the Persian Gulf toward China, South Korea and Japan.  About 80 percent of Japan's oil passes through the Malacca Straits. Closure of the Straits in the event of a terrorist attack would require ships to travel an additional 994 miles from the Gulf. Freight rates would increase sharply. In all, the Straits accounts for a third of the world's trade and half of the world's oil supply.  The security situation in the Malacca Straits has always been a matter of concern. For centuries, it has been a haven for pirates. It is a narrow waterway - just 1.5 miles wide at its narrowest point. Choking the Straits by blowing up a ship would not be difficult. Besides, its shallow reefs, innumerable islets and the slow movement of ships thanks to the heavy traffic in the waterway provide the perfect environment for pirates and terrorists to operate, making it a tempting target.  Maritime piracy in the Malacca Straits has witnessed a sharp increase in recent years. Worldwide, it has increased by three times in the past decade, growing by 20% last year alone. According to the International Maritime Bureau, Southeast Asia witnessed 189 incidents of piracy last year, accounting for more than 40% of the global total.  Terrorism experts point out that if pirates were able to strike with such ease in the Straits, terrorists would find it even easier. Analysts are warning that al-Qaeda and its affiliates in the region, such as Jemaah Islamiya, might take the help of local pirates to carry out an attack in the Malacca Straits.  A recent spurt in crew abductions in the Straits has triggered fear that pirates acting in concert with terrorists might be using the kidnapped crew to acquire training in navigating large commercial vessels. In March 2003, 10-armed men hijacked an Indonesian chemical tanker.  They seized control over the ship apparently to learn to steer it. After operating the ship for an hour through the Straits, they left with equipment and technical documents. "This might be the maritime equivalent to the Florida flight school where the September 11 [2001] terrorists took their flying lessons," observed the Washington-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security (IAGS).  Security agencies are not ruling out the possibility of terrorists capturing a vessel loaded with liquid natural gas and slamming it into a pier in Singapore or ramming tugboats into oil tankers or vessels with chemical fertilizer.  Sections who are in favor of the Americans playing a bigger role in the Straits question whether the littoral states will be able to counter a terrorist attack on their own. The IAGS observed: "Despite claims by Indonesian naval officers that their navy is able to provide sufficient response to the security problems in the region, many naval experts think otherwise. The Indonesian navy is aging and suffers from lack of warships and resources to patrol its vast coastline and the periphery of some 17,000 islands. Of its 117 naval ships, comprising 14 warships, 57 patrol boats and 44 support vessels such as tankers and carriers, only 30 percent are seaworthy.  "With such insufficient maritime power, it is clear that Indonesia simply cannot secure the 600-mile Straits alone, but its fear of any perceived challenge to its sovereignty as well as its concern of American 'imperialism' apparently overrides military logic," said the IAGS.  At the Singapore conference, the US position on the maritime security initiative was a watered-down version of the plan outline by Fargo in March. US officials said it was up to concerned countries - not the United States - to decide how they wanted to police the Malacca Straits.  "It will not be US forces that do that. It will not be US forces coming down unnecessarily and doing anything aggressive," said Admiral Walter Doran, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, adding that there were also no plans for "bases, or standing forces".  There was a visible toning-down in Malaysia's position as well. While it continued to maintain that involvement of foreign forces would prove counterproductive, it indicated that it was willing to discuss the regional maritime security initiative. "We should definitely expand our cooperation with the US and others, in terms of acquiring and sharing quality intelligence," Malaysia's deputy prime minister said.  He is due to meet Fargo this month, when he will be discussing among other things "possible exercises, in the form of specific anti-piracy or anti-terrorist type of operations which, maybe, some countries are more familiar with and more experienced in than us".  However, Razak stressed that "the actual interdiction, if it comes to that, would come to the littoral states to execute".  Malaysia, meanwhile, will next year have its own version of the US Coast Guard to patrol and safeguard security along the Straits. A new paramilitary maritime enforcement agency will begin its operations in March, said Mohd Nazri Abdul Aziz, a minister in the Prime Minister's Department.  Mohd Nazri said that the agency would administer laws, curb criminal activities, monitor the maritime zone and rescue and research operations and assist the Malaysian armed forces during emergencies, crises or wars.  "The safety of the Straits of Malacca is important. If not guarded properly, foreign powers may be prone to intervene in its management, and this will pose a threat to the country's sovereignty," he said.  Currently, maritime enforcement laws are administered in a sectorial manner by 11 government departments and agencies involving 5,000 personnel and more than 400 vessels. Initially, the new agency will have 82 small and medium-sized boats and will take over assets from the various agencies in stages.  The narrowing of the gap in the positions between the various countries concerned with security in the Malacca Straits augurs well for the global effort to tackle maritime terrorism. The question is whether the concerned countries will get their acts together soon enough. Japan has also expressed interest in taking part in any talks on maritime security in the Malacca Straits.  US heavy-handedness and insensitivity to local concerns of sovereignty and national pride have contributed in significant measure to the failure of the "war on terrorism" to achieve its goals. If the war on maritime terrorism should succeed, this would have to change.   Comment  - Singapore, in contrast, had no reservations over the involvement of the Americans in policing the Straits. And Singapore will also work with India, South Korea and other nations to enhance security in the Straits. Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said this week: "One of the major issues which we will discuss with South Korea is involvement by South Koreans in maritime security. The Singapore armed forces has interactions with the Korean military from time to time. We hope to expand and deepen these interactions. LuisB"  Source;  Asia Times Online Ltd. June 04  Write;  by Sudha Ramachandran - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  BELGIAN - INTERNAL SECURITY   The Islamic belgian case   Shortly after 6:30 p.m. on a Tuesday in December, a young man named Ahmed Azzuz marched into a Belgian television station, burst onto the set of the evening news and, standing beside the startled anchorwoman and directly before the cameras, unfurled the red, black, green and white flag of Palestine. "Stop the hypocrisy!" he demanded in Dutch as news crews scrambled behind the scenes to regain control. It was the 16th anniversary of the first intifada, and Azzuz had a message: "Israel must vanish," he said, his voice calm and even. "The killings of Palestinians must cease."   When he had finished speaking, he calmly thanked the audience, rolled up his flag, and walked away. The whole episode took less than two minutes. Police were called, but lacking sufficient grounds for his arrest, he says, they simply gave him a ride home.  Azzuz is a Founder and the Belgian President of the Arab European League, or AEL, an outspoken self-styled civil rights movement with a growing membership - and growing influence - in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and beyond. Combining Arab nationalism with impassioned Islamism, it positions itself as an uncompromising defender of European Muslims, eschewing assimilation and espousing confrontational political ideas such as the introduction of sharia law in Europe. It has warned of - or threatened - an "almost unpreventable" attack on Antwerp's Jewish community if it does not "cancel its support for Jewish policy as fast as possible and distance itself from the state of Israel." (Azzuz's "Stop the hypocrisy" was a reference to those Belgian Jews who, he claims, join the Israeli army, which he sees as proof that Belgium is biased toward Israel.)  More recently, the Dutch faction of the League issued an invitation to Pakistani extremist Hussain Ahmed, leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a group with known ties to al-Qaida and the Taliban, to speak at a congress center in the Netherlands. (Dutch officials subsequently refused to grant Ahmed an entry visa, citing national security concerns; the AEL blamed "the Zionist lobby" for the decision.) The AEL has issued public approvals of 9/11, pledged solidarity with Iraqi insurgents and has challenged new French measures to ban Muslim headscarves in public schools.  Had Azzuz used his guerrilla TV tactic at an American network, it would have been national news - and he might still be in detention. In Europe, however, Azzuz's piece of political theater aroused less outrage - in part because Europe, home to some 15 million Muslims, is struggling to figure out how to deal with the militancy of small but growing groups like the Arab European League without trampling on civil rights, and without alienating more moderate Muslims who are by far the bigger bloc.  To its defenders, the league is an uncompromising advocate for European Muslims, in the tradition of American blacks and Latinos who aggressively called for recognition in the '60s. But to its critics, including some fellow Muslims, the league and its charismatic leader, Dyab Abou Jahjah, are a divisive and potentially destructive force, so provocative that some Belgian officials have sought to knock its Web site offline or even to have the group banned outright. In the wake of the March terror bombings in Spain and a pair of controversial new reports linking anti-Semitic acts in Europe to Muslim immigrants, Jahjah, Azzuz and their league allies are coming under closer law enforcement scrutiny and increasing political pressure.  Just before the Madrid attacks, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service disclosed in a report that the number of Muslim immigrants in that country being recruited by international jihadists had increased. Pinpointing groups like the AEL, the report warned "a violent radical Islamic movement is gradually taking root in the Dutch society." (The Dutch government has just learned that it could be targeted by al-Qaida, in part because of the radicalization of Muslims in the Netherlands, according to press reports. Spanish and Italian intelligence have reportedly heard on phone taps that a terrorist group is "standing by" in Holland.) And in a report by the European Union's Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia issued March 31, researchers found that young Muslims were the biggest force behind a wave of anti-Semitic incidents and attacks in Europe since 2001.  Far from apologizing, Jahjah and other league leaders have seemed to draw energy from conflict and controversy. The league has largely declined to condemn a wave of anti-Semitic acts by Muslim youth. League officials have offered no public criticism of the March 11 Madrid train bombings that left nearly 200 dead and hundreds more injured. (Authorities believe a Moroccan terrorist cell carried out the attack with ties to al-Qaida). Instead, Jahjah suggested in a televised debate that a similar attack was likely in the Netherlands. "It's logical," he said. "You make war with us, we make war with you."  Despite their confrontational stance, AEL leaders insist that they advocate only peaceful methods of change: Jahjah has declared, "We are against violence." But their stance is ambiguous. One line from the AEL manifesto asserts: "You don't receive equal rights: you take them." And the league's Web site praises Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, who along with seven bystanders was assassinated in March by Israel in a missile attack. Yassin, the site said, is "an example for many of us."  Somali-born Dutch Parliamentarian Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a former Muslim whose outspoken criticism of Islam's treatment of women has made her the target of death threats from Muslims around the world, blasted this statement in a March 27 Op-Ed in the Dutch newspaper de Trouw. "A terrorist leader with the blood of hundreds on his hands is evidently a source of inspiration for the young men and women of the AEL," she wrote.  Jahjah stirred more controversy in an open letter to U.S. President George W. Bush.  "Mr. President," the letter reads, "we are a peaceful people, we do not attack unless we are attacked, we do not kill unless we are killed, and we do not aggress, we defend. If you want peace, you and your people, there is only one way, and that is the way out of our land." But if the U.S. continues its close backing of Israel and "the Zionists," Jahjah warns, and persists with its "aggression and occupation troops in Faloudja, in Baghdad, in Nadjaf, in Gaza and Jerusalem and Ramallah ... more and more of your soldiers will undoubtedly rest in peace."  It is the sort of rhetoric that has come to define the self-described "Arabian panther." Eloquent, charismatic and Hollywood handsome - think George Clooney meets Robert de Niro - the 32-year-old Jahjah founded the Arab European League in Belgium in 2000, before the 9/11 attacks. Born in Lebanon and now a citizen of Belgium, he is part Malcolm X and part rock star. His makes no attempt to conceal his goal: He wants to introduce sharia - the religious laws and codes of Islam - to form what he calls a "sharocracy" in Europe. The sale of alcohol in grocery stores would be banned, as would sexually suggestive advertising. Islamic holidays would become national holidays, like Christmas.  Jahjah has spoken of the Sept. 11 attacks as "sweet revenge," though the Dutch newsweekly HP/de Tijd quoted him as saying he would prefer to have seen empty planes crash the Pentagon and the White House. "I'd have found that quite beautiful," he said.  Jahjah and his followers vehemently insist that Middle Eastern immigrants and their children must preserve their own culture and religion; comparing assimilation to "fascism" and "rape," Jahjah demands that the cultural and religious traditions of Middle Eastern immigrants and their children be not just preserved but integrated into the culture of the West. "I'd rather die than assimilate," Jahjah has said.  When asked by a Belgian television reporter if terrorism or a revolution were possible in the Lowlands, he offered a curt reply: "With the AEL, it could very well happen."  Jahjah and the AEL burst into the headlines in November 2002, when Moroccan youths (Belgians of Moroccan descent are simply called "Moroccans") looted shops, threw stones, smashed cars and staged a three-day standoff with police after a psychologically disturbed Belgian shot and killed a young Muslim teacher on the streets of Antwerp for no apparent reason. Belgian officials blamed Abou Jahjah. Though Jahjah insisted his only part in the event was trying to calm everybody down, police arrested him after the chaos had subsided and thoroughly searched his home. The AEL called this proof of Belgium's ongoing vendetta against their movement; Belgian lawmakers contended that Jahjah posed a danger to the community of Antwerp. Jahjah was released after an Antwerp court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to hold him.  Either way, the arrest propelled his name and the league's cause into the international arena. To some, he was a celebrity radical, an alluring combination of sex symbol and martyr; the Belgian media frequently called him the "black angel of integration."  That was hardly the first brush with notoriety for the league. In April 2002, enraged by Israel's massive military assault into the West Bank in response to a Palestinian terrorist attack, Moroccans and AEL members smashed the storefronts of Jewish-owned shops, calling for jihad and chanting "Osama bin Laden!" Before the U.S. invaded Iraq a little over a year ago, league members hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails during anti-American demonstrations staged at the Antwerp harbor.  In 2003, almost a year after Pim Fortuyn's assassination, the league opened a Dutch chapter; soon after, Mohammed Cheppih was appointed to head it. But earlier statements from Cheppih supporting suicide bombers in Palestine and the death penalty for homosexuals provoked such an outcry that he was forced to step down. Still, he remains an influential consultant to the league.  Today, behind a motto that is early Malcolm X - "by any means necessary" - the Arab European League reports steady growth, with members now in 12 countries. In Holland, it says, membership has surged from 200 in March 2003 to about 1,000 now. A new office has opened in France, and last summer, the league deployed a new political wing, the Muslim Democratic Party, to represent its views in European Parliamentary elections this year.  For its adherents, the AEL offers a united platform and an amplified voice. This is especially true for the second- and third-generation children of immigrants who came here - primarily from Turkey and Morocco - as guest workers in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, kids struggling to define their identity in a post-9/11 and increasingly nationalistic Europe. The children and even the grandchildren of Turkish and Moroccan immigrants are still considered "Turkish" or "Moroccan," rather than Dutch or Belgian. To these boys, Jahjah is a role model, a hero; for girls, he is a star. One newspaper quoted a young girl saying to Jahjah's bodyguards outside a talk he gave in Holland: "I just want to see him in the real."  In person and via the league's Web site, Jahjah speaks directly to these disenfranchised youth. He is deeply mistrustful of the Western press, arguing that no matter what he says, he will be misquoted or that “the Zionist lobby” will twist his words in an effort to turn popular opinion against him. Non-Muslim reporters are barred from Jahjah's lectures and speeches, and he pointedly ignored Salon's several attempts to reach him. Other AEL officers rarely speak to non-Muslim members of the press.  However, Jahjah's Belgian lieutenant, Azzuz, agreed to an interview in December, after a series of protests that led to the arrest of 10 league members - including some who hung the Palestinian flag over the Dutch Parliament building in The Hague and Azzuz's own television caper. Speaking by phone from Antwerp, the 27-year-old Belgian AEL leader, the son of Moroccan immigrants, was cordial but direct. The deaths of 9/11 were "collateral damage" - a term, he says, that Muslims learned from Americans. "Finally, something had happened to those who kill our women and children," he said of the terror strikes that have reshaped world politics. "But America still blames others. They didn't learn their lesson at all." What lesson is that? "Stop supporting the terrorist state of Israel," Azzuz replied. George Bush "doesn't hold the strings," he says, the Zionists do.  Relations between the peoples of the West and the Middle East have deteriorated to such a point, Azzuz said, that "something like Sept. 11 is likely to happen again."  Belgium is a world capital of the diamond industry; it is a small but powerful engine of European capitalism, a bastion of conservatism and home to a large population of Orthodox Jews. It has long struggled to reconcile the submerged cultural conflicts between its Flemish, or Dutch-speaking, culture and the French-speaking Walloons. Neighboring Holland, by contrast, is a tiny country with a large reputation for liberalism and tolerance. In "coffeeshops" throughout the country, menu items for "Colombian" and "Purple Mountain" refer not to java but to varieties of marijuana; in the winding streets of Amsterdam's red light district, women pose in lingerie before the windows. It is here that same-sex marriage and doctor-assisted euthanasia were first made legal.  But the two countries share a common dynamic: As their Muslim populations have grown larger and more restive, both have spawned a sometimes-fierce anti-immigrant backlash. The result has been a cycle of building hostilities between Muslim and European in which it is usually impossible to tell who threw the first stone.  The influx of Muslims into Holland, Belgium and the other nations of Europe is hardly new. Tens of thousands have arrived, mostly from Turkey and Morocco, since the 1960s and 1970s. Those in the first wave, like immigrants everywhere, often came looking for political freedom and economic opportunity. Even now, though, the grandchildren of those immigrants say they often feel like second-class citizens in the countries they call home. The immigrants' levels of education are generally lower; for them and their children, unemployment rates are higher. In Belgium, unemployment among Muslims is estimated at up to 40 percent.  Still, the population of Muslims in Europe continues to grow. According to one recent report, it could nearly double by 2015, approaching 30 million.  Almost a million Muslims now live in the Netherlands, giving the country the second-highest Muslim population per capita in Europe, after France. In a country still coming to grips with its guilt over the large numbers of Jews deported during the Nazi occupation more than 60 years ago, many are reluctant to discriminate against a different religious group, even if that group stands opposed to Holland's famed liberal and secular mores.  But after some Dutch Moroccans openly celebrated the 9/11 attacks, and after a radical imam in Rotterdam pronounced that "homosexuals are pigs," many among the Dutch were pushed over the brink. The rightist sociology professor Pim Fortuyn rose suddenly to political prominence, inaugurating his own party which he led into Parliamentary elections. Fortuyn, a gay man, ripped Islam as a "backward culture" and called for tough new curbs on immigration. Though he was assassinated in the spring of 2002, his party swept to power with considerable support from voters under 30. Though Fortuyn's party did not hold power long, its powerful influence is still felt in strict new immigration rules and the planned deportation of 26,000 failed asylum-seekers.  The rise of far-right parties like Lijst Pim Fortuyn and Belgium's Vlaams Blok and the popularity of right-wing leaders like France's Jean-Marie le Pen has made European Muslims feel increasingly unwelcome, even hated.  "People are getting angry," says Ayhan Tonca, chairman of Holland's largest organization of Turkish mosques.  The international political climate in recent years has further eroded tolerance and goodwill on both sides. The bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict has inflamed Muslim animosity toward the West, a rage fueled by Arab news stations and Internet sites that beam graphic news and propaganda into Muslim homes throughout the West, thousands of miles from the zones of conflict.  In that atmosphere, the rhymes Moroccan youth chant beneath the stormy skies and along the cobbled streets of Holland's Jewish neighborhoods have become frighteningly familiar: "Hamas, Hamas, alle Joden aan het gas!" they cry. ("Hamas, Hamas, all Jews to the gas!) Or: "Joden moet je doden!" which translates with chilling simplicity: "Kill Jews!" On May 4, 2003, during a national moment of silence in remembrance of those who perished in Holocaust, a group of Moroccan boys began playing soccer with the wreath Holland's Queen Beatrix had placed by the Holocaust Memorial at the Palace in Amsterdam. There is an increasing incidence of race-based crimes, such as the recent murder of a teacher by a Turkish student in The Hague. "The teacher dishonored him," one friend of the confessed killer, known only as "Murat D.," explained to the media as other Turkish classmates chanted, "Murat, we love you!"  And while Jewish schoolboys in France now leave yarmulkes at home because the law demands it, in Holland, they do so out of fear. Indeed, the Dutch Center for Information and Documentation on Israel reports a 140 percent increase in anti-Semitic acts in the year 2002 and first half of 2003. That number "omits any act that could be viewed as anti-Israel," says the center's director, Ronny Naftaniel.  "There were some 330 incidents last year," says Naftaniel, who estimates that 75 percent were perpetrated by Moroccan youth. "There is a minimal amount of anti-Semitism that is constant in Holland, of course, but if you blame Jews for being the world power who direct the politics of the world, if you throw stones at Orthodox Jews, if you chant 'Hamas, Hamas' on trams and buses in the cities, that's anti-Semitism, and that's a problem."  Some Muslim leaders also acknowledge rampant, and often rabid, anti-Semitism in the Muslim communities here; even Jahjah and other AEL officials have, on occasion, spoken against it. But not Naima Elmaslouhi, the Arab European League's vice president in Holland. Speaking briefly by cellphone from the Amsterdam police station in December, as she waited for the release of fellow league officers arrested during a pro-Palestinian demonstration, she said the claims of anti-Semitism are exaggerated. "It's just one or two incidents," she said.  Perhaps the clearest expression of who Jahjah is and what he wants comes in his book, "Tussen 2 Werelden: Roots van Een Vrijheidstrijd," or "Between Two Worlds: The Roots of a Freedom Fight." Published late last year by the prestigious Dutch-Belgian publisher J.M. Meulenhoff, a house known for its strong list of Jewish literature, Jahjah's memoir-cum-manifesto suggests that ambiguity and contradiction are central to his character - and maybe to his strategy.  Born and raised in Hanin, in south Lebanon, Jahjah grew up in the midst of that country's civil war and Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which culminated in the 1982 slaughter in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla, where an Israeli commission of inquiry found that Israeli forces and their commander Ariel Sharon were indirectly responsible for the massacre of at least 800, and perhaps as many as 2,000, Palestinian civilians at the hands of Israel's Christian Phalange allies.  In the early 1990s, at the age of 19, Jahjah traveled to the West; he applied for political asylum in Belgium, telling immigration officials that he'd been a member of the militant Shiite group Hezbollah and was seeking to escape its persecution. When authorities began to question his story, he married a Belgian ex-girlfriend, receiving residency as her spouse. The couple divorced shortly after his papers came through. Since then, he has denied he was a member of Hezbollah, saying he made the story up to get asylum.  The league, Jahjah says in his book, isn't especially radical, but rather a "healthy, democratic protest organization born of the frustration and disappointment and hurt" of its members, a movement that seeks only equality and freedom. Only action, maintains Jahjah, will produce change. Azzuz agrees, saying that sometimes a bit of civil disobedience is necessary to win attention. "It's not like we take hostages," he says. But in another passage, Jahjah's book also contains a somewhat different message: "Violence is no solution," he writes, "but it can open the way to a solution."  In his book, Jahjah claims people wrongly accuse him of ties to al-Qaida when in fact, he says, it is the AEL that is terrorized. Bodyguards protect him from the many domestic and international organizations that he claims want him dead, including Israel's Mossad. (Israel dismissed the charge as "laughable.")  But critics see evidence of the league's character not only in what Jahjah says and does, but equally in what he doesn't say:. For instance, neither he nor the AEL condemns al-Qaida. And while it would be unreasonable to blame Jahjah, Azzuz or the Arab European League for the wave of anti-Semitism, they are widely seen as contributing to the climate of rage and polarization, if only by issuing mixed messages.  This impression was strengthened last November, after terrorists suspected of al-Qaida links killed more than 50 people and injured hundreds in four bombings in Turkey - including two bombings at Istanbul synagogues. Some in the AEL did publicly condemn the attacks. But Elmaslouhi, the Dutch league's vice president, voiced "support and understanding" for the bombers. "I am against the killing of innocents," she told the Dutch newspaper Algemeene Dagblad, "but how do you know who is innocent?"  To some critics, Jahjah, Azzuz and others in the Arab European League seem less interested in multicultural harmony than in hostile separatism. These critics warn that a militant "Arab pride" movement poses risks that far surpass mere social tension.  The recent report by the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service noted that self-styled mujahedin "purposefully influence members of the Muslim communities in the Netherlands in order to create a polarization in society and to alienate the Muslims from the rest of the population." The effect, according to the report, is to strengthen their recruitment efforts by "appealing to the idea that the rights and interests of 'good' Muslims are being violated time and again." As proof of the potential danger, the report cites the example of two Dutch-Moroccans who were killed in Kashmir while training for jihad.  Such concerns have provoked officials in both Belgium and Holland to wonder whether the Arab European League should be banned. In Belgium, Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has called Jahjah a "threat to society," though his effort to shut down the AEL on the grounds of "inciting violence, issuing threats and disturbing the public order" - a move Jahjah ascribed to "the Zionist lobby" - failed.  But when the AEL posted its statement supporting Hamas founder Yassin on its Dutch-language Web site, motions were filed in the Belgian courts to have the page, if not the entire site, pulled from the Web. While the courts debate, the provider serving the site has cancelled the League's account, forcing it to scramble for another and rebuild essentially from scratch. (The English version of the site remains for the most part intact.)  But some are concerned that banning the league would only send the movement underground, making it even more dangerous. "At least, it's out there in the open," says Ayhan Tonca, who heads the organization of Turkish mosques in Holland.  For their part, AEL members accuse European officials of criminalizing their movement and exaggerating the social problems within the Euro-Muslim community. Even if that's true, the increased pressure on the league and allied groups is likely to increase the tension. As with the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and the widening conflict between Islamist groups and the West, it sometimes seems that there is no middle ground.  Tonca, speaking from Holland's Turkish community, says he understands the appeal of the Arab European League, and cautions that Europe has no choice but to accept a cultural evolution. "We have to accept that Muslims are a part of Europe," he says. "It isn't just a Judeo-Christian culture anymore."  Moroccan-born Mohamed Sini, a Dutch Labor Party official who chairs the organization Islam and Citizenship, calls the league an "extremist group" that only exacerbates tensions. Tonca, too, accuses Jahjah of being not much different than his opponents - Fortuyn, le Pen, the Vlaams Blok. All, he says, divide in anger rather than unite in peace.  The European establishment is wrestling with similar worries. Last December, the European Union shelved a report that blamed Muslims for the recent wave of anti-Semitism; when a  new draft was issued last month, it blamed neo-Nazi and other racist groups, with Muslims being only a secondary cause – even though the numbers in the report showed that Muslims were in fact behind most of the incidents.  But to those who say that Europe must become a melting pot now in a way that it has not been in modern times, Jahjah and other league members say they're not interested in blending in.  Absorbing the principles and norms of Holland, Belgium and other European democracies, they say, would mean sacrificing their integrity, their identity as Muslims. Rather, they argue, the Judeo-Christian majority of Europe should incorporate Islamic norms and values into its own. "Europe would be a better, safer place," a message on the now-defunct Dutch Arab European League Web site proclaimed, "if it observed the values and the norms of Islam."  "As a minority group," says Azzuz, "we have rights."  "Idiocy!" Naftaniel snaps in reply. "Integration doesn't ask that you give up your culture."  Despite the league's plans to expand its presence in the coming year, especially in France, Naftaniel, Tonca and Sini all maintain that the movement will eventually fall by the wayside. "They fail to serve the real concerns and interests of [European] Muslims," Sini says, "mostly because they blame everyone else for the tensions without looking within themselves."  But he is nonetheless concerned, both about the AEL's actions and about the responses they engender. "Extremism," he warns, "breeds extremism."  Tonca likewise worries that Abou Jahjah's call will produce Turkish militants. "The most dangerous terrorists are those who are well educated in the West," he notes, "and I fear that the Muslims who are educated here are becoming radical."  Separation, Naftaniel says, is not compatible with democracy; coexistence requires collaboration and cooperation. "If one believes in democracy," he says, "then the most challenging thing is to sit down with those who with whom you differ."  That might be the starting point for détente, but does the league want détente? Its signals have been mixed, at best. Jahjah himself has publicly denounced the chants of "Hamas, Hamas, alle Joden aan het gas!" Elsewhere, though, he has expressed impatience with talk of peaceful coexistence. "The days of sharing couscous with a Jew are over," he told Belgian newspaper De Morgen in April 2002.  Another top league official, apparently distressed by reports that Muslim children in Holland refuse to listen to classes about the Holocaust, wrote in a statement on a league site that the organization is "against each and every form of discrimination and racism. As Muslims we see the Jews as 'the people of the book' and it is obligatory to fight the hate against these people." But the statement continues: "With equal fury the AEL fights Nazism and Zionism." This association of Israel with Nazism, common these days among European Muslims, is widely seen as a crude and inflammatory form of anti-Semitism.  Which to believe, then - the overtures of peace, or the rhetoric of fury?  In the interest of the vrijheidstrijd, or the freedom fight, Jahjah wraps himself in the mantel of the American revolutionary hero Patrick Henry. "We seek only to live in peace and with the freedom to live our own lives with equality, appreciation, and respect," he writes in "Between Two Worlds." "And if anyone tries to remove that right and to oppose us, we will fight until the oppression stops, and we acquire freedom - or die in the attempt."  Write;  by Abigail R.

        HIGHLIGHTS    GEOPOLITICA – AFRICA – NAMIBIA   Marathon Congress Drains Emotions   The half moon was above the President's Hall of the Windhoek Show Society, as the elections director announced that Lands Minister Hifikepunye Lucas Pohamba was halfway to becoming President-elect.   Just as Windhoek's street lamps overwhelmed the moonlight, Pohamba needed the votes of nomination contender Nahas Angula to drown out the challenge of former Foreign Affairs Minister Hidipo Hamutenya.  Angula, one of three nominees for the ruling party's presidential candidate in the upcoming national elections, had fallen out in the first round. By the time Pohamba wrapped it up in the early hours of a chilly Sunday morning, the moon had long retired, leaving the twinkling stars to light up the sky for Swapo's congress delegates as they moved celebrations from the Show Grounds to the party's head office in Katutura.  The celebrations seemed less about rejoicing over Pohamba's victory than letting off steam over the events of the preceding week that had raised the tension among the nominees and their supporters. It had been an arduous trip to Swapo's watershed special congress called to select a successor to President Sam Nujoma.   The hour arrives   A sense of trepidation hung in the air as the more than 500 delegates gathered on Friday. After weeks of reports that Nujoma was campaigning against Hamutenya, the President set a confrontational tone on Monday by dismissing his Foreign Affairs Minister and his protege. Hamutenya defended himself, saying he was fired on flimsy grounds and suggested that dirty tricks had been used to get him out of the race.  Shortly before the congress opens, some delegates talk about their fears and concerns. For others, the body language shows that their nerves are on edge. That same day, one of the delegates is reportedly admitted for psychiatric treatment after a nervous breakdown.  One delegate said the person from the Oshikoto Region was overwhelmed by the pressure of "political elephants" fighting. Others say the breakdown may have been caused by party politics in the regions rather than the presidential race. In the hall by 18h00 - Many delegates try to disguise their jitters by singing and dancing to liberation music. Anti-colonial tunes, such as Mambulu djeimo moNamibia (Boers get out of Namibia) are still a potent rallying cry in the ruling party. Nujoma's restrained opening statement seems to soothe the anxiety of expectant delegates. Friday night passes without much fanfare.   D-Day  Delegates, adorned in Swapo colours - suits, scarves, beads and hats - return the next morning for the election.  They are locked in the meeting hall, and had yet to start voting by 13h00, as they listened to the candidates and their backers promoting themselves.  By then people had already caucused often and for a long time, and had agreed who to vote for, or agreed to disagree. Voting is over by 17h00. An hour later they are back in the hall, ostensibly to hear the results.  More songs:Olye ngoka ta ende kombanda yomeya? Hailwa Sema yaNujoma (Who's that walking on water? Comrade Sam Nujoma). Anxiety builds up. The hall falls silent when Bonny Haufiku takes the microphone. He is only looking for a lost ID. More tense moments for the candidates and their supporters, eyes to the desk in front and to the television screens.  20h35: Angula, Hamutenya and Pohamba give journalists a photo opportunity.  Waiting continues.  21h25: Elections director, acting Judge Petrus Damaseb, walks in.  21h35: Nujoma follows, his fist punching the air as the crowd sings Sema owu li peni? (Sam where are you?). He seems tense and nervous. Damaseb announces the first results. Delegates must vote again and reconvene at 03h00. The final results are out by 03h35.  Half an hour later, Nujoma looks at his watch when Tjiriange announces that celebrations will continue with the braai at Swapo headquarters.  There is no moon by then, but plenty of stars in the sky.  Celebrations continued through Sunday.  "Swapo is the winner," says Swapo activist Willem Nathinge.

Police in Spain, Italy and the UK have been working around the clock to localize several cells of Ansar al Islam, some of whose members have already been identified, who intend to commit attacks against British and Italian targets during President Bush's trip to Europe, antiterrorist sources have informed La Razón. These groups are composed primarily of Algerian fundamentalists, although there are also some Moroccans, and they were trained in the camps of Afghanistan.  The alarm sounded in Europe upon the receipt of completely reliable information that several cells of Ansar al Islam, the terrorist group in the Al Qaeda network led by the Jordanian terrorist Mohammed al Zarkawi, is planning to commit large-scale attacks in Italy and the UK. The "commandos" have operational and logistical support in Spain, where they may have obtained money and some of the false documentation they use. In theory, according to the sources, it is not believed that they are going to carry out attacks in Spain, although any scenario is possible, given the dangerous nature of the Islamists.  Current investigations are directed at localizing, as soon as possible, a group of Algerian extremists who are already in the UK and Italy to attempt to carry out attacks in the next few days, coinciding with the European tour that the leader of the US begins in Italy tomorrow. The police of these countries, with the close cooperation of the Spanish police, have managed to identify some of the terrorists, some of whom may be Moroccan.  These are experienced terrorists who, according to the sources, received their training in the Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, where they learned techniques for the manufacture and placement of explosives and highly destructive weapons.  In May, Judge Baltsar Garzón of the Audiencia Nacional sent three Algerians and one Spaniard to prison for their alleged connection with a terrorist group related to Al Qaeda, and he asked the UK to hand over the alleged head of the group, Heidi Ben Youssef Boudhiba, alias "Fathi," who is being held in [England] and who has been connected with the cell that attempted to carry out a ricin attack in London.

Speaking on the second day of the 14th annual World Economic Forum Africa Economic Summit in Maputo, Mozambique, Manuel noted that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) had done "as much or more" than any institution to root out corruption within its ranks in recent years, having convicted 27 people for corruption in 2002 alone.   "Corruption is indeed a big issue," he said. "But we must also hit out at the corruptors as hard as those who take it--and it is imperative that the private and public sectors campaign together on the issue."   He called for a "big campaign" to blacklist those companies involved in issuing bribes in the Lesotho Highlands project, to ensure that they did not receive new contracts. Currently even the World Bank was avoiding Lesotho, he observed.   Manuel added that one of the biggest challenges was to make rules and salaries transparent and predictable.   "It is clear that one can't live off a government salary and it is clear that one must go after baksheesh to survive. It is a joint responsibility between the public and private sectors to ensure that salaries are adequate and fair, thus relieving the temptations of corruption."   Approximately 550 leaders from all sectors of society are currently participating in the three-day WEF Summit, the first to be held in Mozambique. This year's theme is "Engaging Business in Development".

The military exercises are part of China's annual maneuvers involving large numbers of troops, ships, aircraft and missiles, and will take place on Dongshan Island. The island is located off the coast of Fujian province along the southern Chinese coast near Taiwan.   A U.S. intelligence official said the exercises will begin later this month.   "It isn't just a training exercise. It's also intended to send a political message [to Taiwan]," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  The official said the political message in the exercises is one of "military readiness," intended to signal to Taiwan that China is ready to use force if necessary to reunite the island with the mainland.   Past war games on Dongshan, which is used for amphibious assault exercises, have involved 30,000 to 100,000 troops and large numbers of warships, submarines and combat aircraft.   The maneuvers are set to begin as the governments of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) last week traded accusations that rival patrolling warplanes crossed the line dividing the Taiwan Strait into Chinese-and Taiwanese-controlled waters.   The government-owned Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao, which first disclosed the exercises in a report published Monday, said that about 18,000 troops would participate and that the war games are practice for "seizing control of the air over the Taiwan Strait."   The exercises are expected to continue through July, the newspaper said.       China's communist government has expressed anger through press statements in recent weeks. China views plan by Taiwanese leader Chen Shui-bian for a referendum on updating the island's constitution in 2006 as a move toward formal independence, which Beijing opposes.   The Pentagon on Friday released an annual report on Chinese military power, which said Beijing is making strides at boosting its space defense capabilities.   The report provided information that the Chinese military is working on methods of space warfare against U.S. intelligence.  It was the first public warning by the Pentagon that the Chinese are considering ways of "blinding" U.S. eyes in space before launching any attack on Taiwan.   The space-warfare elements of the report bolster the findings of a 1999 congressional commission led by Rep. Christopher Cox, California Republican, that said China is developing space weapons.

Speaking at International Renewable Energy Conference in Bonn, Schroeder said the world's dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists.   Terror attacks on oil facilities "are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind", the Chancellor told government representatives from more than 130 countries attending the Bonn conference.   The spate of recent attacks in Saudi Arabia and the continued instability in Iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security, Schroeder said.   He also noted that current high oil prices illustrated an urgent need to move away from oil and towards renewable resources like the sun, wind, hydropower and bio-energy.  The German leader's remarks came at the opening of a two-day ministerial session at the conference.   The conference, which began 1 June and is to end Friday, will issue an International Action Programme (IAP) for renewable energy projects and initiatives around the world.   Earlier Thursday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in a video transmission to the Bonn proceedings, also said building up renewable energy would strengthen world security.

In his first visit to the British capital, Zapatero opened up the prospect of making progress on the controversial European Constitution. The former Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar caused the earlier talks to stall over voting rights. Progress on details of the constitution and the question of who will succeed Romano Prodi as Commission president were expected to dominate the talks.  Blair said the two countries were working closely on European matters and that "it is important we are good partners". Despite major disagreements between Madrid and London on Iraq, the British prime minister insisted   relations between the two countries were "just fine". The decision of Zapatero to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq caused a split between Spain and Britain. It is the latest in a series of meetings Zapatero is conducting with European leaders. He has also travelled to Italy, Germany, France and Portugal. But he has no plans to meet with President George W. Bush who arrives in Italy Thursday for a whistle-stop tour of Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day.

Kenneth Brill, the U.S. ambassador to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told reporters that Iran's refusal to fully cooperate with the agency "fits a long-term pattern of denial and deception that can only be designed to mask Iran's military nuclear program." An IAEA report released on Tuesday said agency inspectors had found more traces in Iran of highly enriched uranium that could be weapons-grade. The IAEA also reported that Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian purposes, has admitted to importing parts for sophisticated P-2 centrifuges for enriching uranium, going back on claims that it had made the parts domestically.  "Almost two years after the IAEA became aware of Iran's covert nuclear program, and fully one year after the discovery of Iran's attempts to conceal their work at the Kalaye Electric Company [in Tehran], delayed access, inconsistent stories and unanswered questions continue to be the hallmark of Iranian cooperation with the agency," Mr. Brill said. "Even a disinterested observer must now ask, what is it that the Iranians are so intent on hiding?" Mr. Brill asked. The IAEA report is to be submitted to the agency's 35-nation board of governors on June 14. The United States has called for the IAEA, which has been investigating the Iranian program since February 2003, to refer the Islamic republic to the U.N. Security Council for possible international sanctions. In Tehran, top nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani said yesterday that Iran had "no secret nuclear activities." Mr. Rowhani said: "Iran's nuclear dossier is on the way to being sorted out and there is nothing very important that is pending." But Mr. Brill said: "Iran is still stalling, providing last-minute declarations and contradicting earlier definitive statements. The IAEA continues to find new, incriminating evidence of undeclared activity. ... "The question is how long the [IAEA] board of governors and the international community will tolerate this," he said. Diplomats and experts said they expected nothing to happen in the short term because Washington does not have a "smoking gun" to prove Iran is making nuclear weapons. "The United States is stymied unless the IAEA can come up with some devastating revelation that Iran is lying or hiding something," said Gary Samore, a London-based nonproliferation expert. He said the Iranians may even be emboldened with their success in putting off the IAEA to resume the enrichment of uranium, something they voluntarily suspended in order to build confidence with the international community. A Western diplomat close to the IAEA said such a move by Iran "would spark a crisis with [Britain, France and Germany] and others and I don't think that's a price Tehran wants to pay." Highly enriched uranium can be used for fuel in reactors but also the explosive in atomic bombs. Another diplomat said nothing less than the international non-proliferation regime was at stake in Iran. The diplomat said getting to the bottom of the Iranian program was "difficult but crucial for nonproliferation and for the IAEA." "If progress is slow, there will come a time when the Europeans will have to reflect on their policy," the diplomat said.

That covert money network, based in the tax havens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Panama and Nassau, helped bankroll the war machines of both Iraq and al-Qaida.    More than 1,000 pages of confidential corporate, bank and legal documents show how the network functioned. The papers come from court cases filed in several European countries, from corporate records, from investigations by Italian police, from a report of the Kroll international investigative agency, and from private sources. The documents are the basis of further investigations coordinated in Europe by the prosecutor of Milan.   They show, for example, that a father-and-son team in Liechtenstein, whose business is setting up shell companies and secret bank accounts, worked to move the money of both Saddam and al-Qaida. Engelbert Schreiber and his son Englebert Schreiber Jr. are listed as founder or board member of Mediterranean Enterprises Development Projects; Tradex; Techno Service Intl.; Saidomin; and Executive Flight Assistance, all Liechtenstein companies that handled arms sales and payoffs for Saddam. They are also listed on corporate documents for Nasreddin International Group Ltd Holding (Liechtenstein). Ahmed Idriss Nasreddin, on the U.S. terrorist blacklist, was a founder of Al Taqwa, the bank that moved money for al-Qaida and which was closed down by the United States after 9/11. The Schreibers declined to respond to numerous requests for comment.   One of the men linked in documents to several Panama shell companies used in the Saddam laundering network was Baudoin Dunand, a Swiss lawyer who is administrator of the Saudi Investment Company (SICO), the Geneva investment affiliate of the Bin Laden family conglomerate, run by Osama bin Laden's half-brother Yeslam Binladen. (They spell their names differently.) Mr. Dunand declined to respond to repeated requests for comment.   The Banca del Gottardo in Lugano, Switzerland, moved al-Qaida money via the Al Taqwa bank, a shell bank that operated through correspondent accounts at the Gottardo branch in Nassau. It also handled payments for the Saddam money network. The bank's spokesman wrote, "Please be advised that we do not intend to make any comments or discuss any issues with you regarding the article you proposed in your e-mail."  Banque Paribas, headquartered in Paris, with a significant portion of shares owned by Saddam's cousin Nadhmi Auchi, moved money for the Al-Mahdi network in the 1980s and was the bank chosen to handle the Iraqi oil-for-food payments. In fact, Iraq insisted that Paribas handle the oil-for-food escrow account. A corporate document for Al Taqwa Trade, Property and Industry Co. Ltd. of Liechtenstein -- an al-Qaida network shell company also shut down by the United States -- lists Banque Paribas, Lugano, where it had accounts. (Paribas in 2000 merged with another French bank to create BNP Paribas, with Auchi continuing as one of the largest shareholders.)  Saddam Hussein began constructing his offshore operation in 1968 in Switzerland, aware that the country's bank secrecy made it a prime place to organize the movement of illicit funds and the purchase of arms. That year, 11 years before his coup, Saddam sent his half-brother Barzan Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti to Geneva to construct the network to launder secret commissions charged on sales of Iraqi crude oil. The system would also be used for kickbacks on purchase from Western arms dealers. Liechtenstein, which Swiss bankers and money-managers often use to handle dubious clients, was used to ensure even more impenetrable secrecy: real names of company and account owners would be hidden from law enforcers.  The keys Iraqis in the operation were Said Rahim Hussein Al-Mahdi and Nadhmi Auchi. Al-Mahdi was sent to Lugano because his father-in-law, Talaak El Naboulsi, an Egyptian soldier and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was then working in Geneva for Barzan. (Barzan is now in U.S. custody.)  Al-Mahdi set up his system of secret companies and accounts with the assistance of the prominent asset managers (also known as trustees or fiduciaries) Elio Borradori in Lugano in the southern, Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, and Enrico Walser and Engelbert Schreiber, in Vaduz, Lichtenstein. He would also use managers in Panama, and the Bahamas. The same jurisdictions would be used to launder money in the oil-for-food sales in the 1990s.  Al-Mahdi established MEDP (Mediterranean Enterprise for Development and Projects), registered in Lugano, with subsidiaries - generally just paper shells - in New York (MEDP USA at 900 Third Ave., New York, incorporated in 1984), London, Paris, Milan, Vienna, Tokyo, Seoul, and Sao Paolo. Nazir Auchi, Nadhmi’s brother, chaired its subsidiary in Baghdad. These shells in turn had shares of other companies that carried out the money laundering and arms purchases.  The offshore networks directed by the two men were crucial intermediaries for such weapons merchants as Messerschmitt-Bulkow-Blohm Helicopter and Military Aircraft Group /MBB (Germany), Thyssen Industries (Germany), Airbus (the consortium of French, German, Spanish and U.K companies), and Dassault (France), which used them to pay kickbacks and, after international embargos were established, to hide illegal sales.  For example, a 1982 bank transfer from the Nassau branch of the Banca del Gottardo in Lugano notes a credit to MEDP's "Satan" account of 33,000,000 French francs (about $6 million) from Dassault International. On a trip to Paris in January 1985, Al-Mahdi signed a contract with Dassault International whereby the company was instructed to send payments to an account at the Indosuez Bank branch in Lugano.  Banca del Gottardo has a colorful history: it is the bank that moved the bribe and kickback money paid by a Swiss construction company to former Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his cronies in exchange for contracts to refurbish Kremlin buildings. In the 1970s, Gottardo was the Swiss subsidiary of Banco Ambrosiano, "the Vatican bank," which collapsed in 1982 in a $1-billion fraud that involved money siphoned off to offshore shell companies and accounts. Ambrosiano had laundered drug- and arms-trafficking money for the Italian and American mafias.  A 1983 document shows $1 million transferred from the Gottardo Satan account to Hamid Al-Tikriti's account at the National Bank of Kuwait. The recipient - Abid Hamid Mahmoud Al-Tikriti - was Saddam's presidential secretary and cousin, arrested by the United States in June 2003. In 1981, half a million dollars had been sent by Gottardo to Hamid Al-Tikriti's Kuwaiti bank account.  Some Satan payments went to individuals in the United States. A December 1982 telex from MEDP Paris requests a transfer of $200,000 from the Satan account to Jawdat T. Mansour and Rihad J. Mansour to their account at the 63rd (Street) and (El) Cajon (Blvd.) office of the San Diego Bank, 4690 63rd Street, San Diego, California.  Asked about the commission agreement, Dassault Vice-President Gerard David said by phone from Paris, "We don't know anything about it. Our president wasn't president then. It was 20 years ago. The law in France is that every 10 years we destroy the archives. We have nothing to say. It's not an answer, but it's the truth."  Al-Mahdi's network used Panama shell companies set up by Roger E. Watson, who had dual American-Panamanian citizenship. An official Panama document dated 1985 lists Watson as vice-president of a company called Radistal; the president was Giuseppe Poggioli, a Lugano financial consultant who acknowledged in e-mail that al-Mahdi was his client. Watson and Poggioli were also officers of another Panama shell company, Dumynta. Poggioli said about Watson, "I think he was the Consul of Panama in Lugano, but I am not 100-percent sure. I have no more contact with him since 1986 or 1987."  In 1985, Al-Mahdi was called back to Baghdad and imprisoned by Saddam, who suspected he was skimming funds, and he was beheaded in 1986. After Al-Mahdi's death, Saddam divided control of the network between the directors of the subsidiary companies of MEDP, Iraqi businessman Manhal Sheikh Kadir in London and the Lebanese Alfred Jawde in New York. Watson, who set up a residence in Como, Italy, replaced Borradori in 1987 as Saddam's financial consultant and managed Panama shell companies for the network via his L.R. European Company. Poggioli said that he, Poggioli, also left the operation. Kadir and Watson could not be located, and Jawde, sent the documents, declined to comment. Borradori was reached, but he is of advanced age and has difficulty communicating.   An Aug. 13, 1990 document signed by International Aircraft Leasing Ltd. And Erfel Anstalt, both shell companies registered in Liechtenstein, noted past "consulting agreements" with Airbus Industries, Blagnac, France, March 7, 1985, and with MBB, Munich, Feb. 19 and March 18, 1985; and a contract with Thyssen Industries AG, Essen, West Germany, Nov. 26, 1987. An Erfel record of that date sets out commissions from MBB and Thyssen totaling SF 720,000 ($432,000).  The United Nations enacted comprehensive trade and weapons embargoes against Iraq in 1990. However, a 1991 Erfel document notes a $255,875 - 5 percent - commission from Airbus and a $45,247 - 5 percent – commission from Thyssen. And a 1991 balance sheet for IAL cites a debt of 1,455,000 German marks due to Thyssen Industries AG, Essen, with FF 3,812 earmarked for Kensington Anstalt, an Al-Mahdi shell company.   IAL prepared a chart that showed that from 1986 to 1991, it collected "commissions" of $1,238,813 (Canadian) from MBB, $10,827,000 (U.S.) from Airbus, $3,900,000 (Canadian) from Thyssen, and DM 1,466,000 from Thyssen D.   Thyssen and Airbus, which now includes MBB, were sent the documents, but company officials declined to respond.   A confidential December 2001 report by Kroll, the international investigative agency, said that two Swiss companies, MEDP Corporation SA in Lugano and Midco Financial SA (in liquidation), were the holding companies that handled the money Saddam skimmed. It said, "Whilst in Geneva, Barzan was believed to have participated in financial schemes that included in the year 2000 the illegal sales of Iraqi petrol" and the purchase of weapons.  The unpublished report, authenticated by Kroll board chairman Jules Kroll, was commissioned by Kuwait after the Gulf War in an attempt to locate Iraqi assets it could claim as compensation. Jules Kroll explained, "In 1990 we were given the assignment and paid by the government of Kuwait." He said the goals were to identify Iraq's procurement network and to find assets outside that would be used to fuel the regime and buy weapons. The 2001 report was an update of the 1991 report."  Kroll investigators discovered that one of the middlemen helping Saddam was Marc Rich, the U.S. tax-evader pardoned by President Clinton. Rich had been indicted by the United States in 1983 on charges he evaded more than $48 million in taxes and illegally bought oil from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. He fled the United States and settled in Switzerland. Kroll said, "We came up with evidence that through Marc Rich's Spanish subsidiary, he was using some Iranian cutouts - specifically Bakhtiar, Iranians, whose family was close to Saddam - he was using them to negotiate arrangements as it related to oil."  "The work was all turned over to OFAC (the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control)," Kroll said. That means the Clinton administration knew about Rich's aid to Saddam.   The Kroll report also dealt with Nadhmi Auchi, reporting the Italian intelligence view that he was a "high-level Iraqi defense procurement and intelligence agent."   After Roger Watson in 1987 became Saddam's financial consultant, he also became an adviser to Auchi's International Company of Banking and Financial Participations (CIPAF). According to official Italian documents, Auchi used Panama to launder kickbacks for two contracts for the Iraqi military. An Italian parliamentary report in 1987 said that one of them, Dowal, set up by Watson, was used to collect $23 million in hidden commissions on Baghdad's purchase of warships manufactured by the Italian shipyard, Cantieri Navali Riuniti.   In another case, the Operation "Clean Hands" (Mani Pulite) investigation in Italy revealed in 1993 that Auchi received about $40 million in hidden commissions to facilitate approval of a Franco-Italian engineering project to construct a pipeline from Iraq to Saudi Arabia. Italian banker Pierfrancesco Pacini Battaglia declared to investigators that he had received instructions to transfer these commissions to accounts in Panama established in the names of Iraqi officials.  Auchi's spokesman condemned any allegations of wrongdoing as "outrageous."  The totals from skimmed oil revenues and contract kickbacks from the late 1970s through the oil-for-food 90s have been estimated by U.S. officials to reach $30 or $40 billion.  Jules Kroll said that until 9/11, a few staff members at the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control "were the only ones spending any energy on this issue in any organized way." He said, "The level of ignorance at the CIA was total, at the FBI it was beyond total. The law enforcement and intelligence community in the U.S. was behind the curve. It was of little interest to them," he said.  Source;  by United Press International. Copyright 2004. All rights reserved.

       NAMIBIA - SOCIAL AFFAIRS   Namibia On the Brink of a Serious Crisis   Namibia and the rest of southern Africa face one of the world's most serious humanitarian crises, a top United Nations official has warned.  Fresh from visits to Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland, James Morris, the UN Secretary General's special envoy for humanitarian needs in southern Africa, has warned of serious consequences if nothing is done to stem the crisis.  "The numbers of food-insecure and vulnerable households tell of an extraordinary human tragedy and southern Africa must still be considered the location of one of the world's most serious humanitarian crises," Morris wrote in a report to the UN.  When he was in Namibia last month, Morris urged Namibia to play a greater role in combating the effects of HIV-AIDS and to offer improved access to services for the rapidly growing number of orphans and vulnerable women.  He said the Government needed to step up efforts to deal with the "humanitarian crisis" in the country.  "I am particularly concerned about the plight of orphans and women and their inability to access critical necessities such as food, clean water, education, and health care," he said.  Morris came to review how the international community could more effectively assist Namibia in battling HIV-AIDS, food security and the drain of human resources.  "An expedited implementation of commitments is required if Namibia is to get through this crisis without losing an entire generation," said Morris.  Namibia ranks among the top five countries in the world most affected by HIV-AIDS. The virus has become the country's leading cause of mortality with nearly a quarter of a million people infected. Average life expectancy will decline to around 40 years of age by the end of 2005 - 25 per cent lower than without HIV. There are already more than 120 000 orphans and vulnerable children in Namibia and the number will reach 250 000 by the year 2020.   The World Food Programme, Unicef and the Namibian Government recently put together a joint appeal of US$5,8 million to help over 600 000 orphans and other vulnerable children and women suffering from the combined effects of erratic weather, severe poverty and worsening HIV-AIDS rates.  However, funding has been slow and this has had a serious effect on the UN's ability to adequately support the most vulnerable groups.   Source;  The Namibian (Windhoek).

The Computer Misuse and Crimes Bill enjoys strong backing from bankers and the Computer Society of Zambia, a group of professionals promoting computer use, who say hacking into dormant accounts has become a problem in this poor southern African country.   "We feel this law will help to deal with the increasing number of electronic frauds and hacking especially in the financial sector," said Milner Makuni, president of the Computer Society of Zambia.   The most famous cyber offence in Zambia was committed by a young computer whizkid who hacked the State House website and replaced the picture of then president Frederick Chiluba with a cartoon.   He was arrested and charged with defamaing the head of state but the case failed to succeed because there was no law in Zambia which deals with cyber crimes.   "The bill, once passed, will help to deal with high tech cyber crimes that our current legal system cannot address," said Bob Samakai, a ministry of communication permanent secretary.   But some cyber experts worry that the measure is likely to be abused by the authorities to curb access to the Internet.   "It is difficult to regulate the use of computers and Internet because we are dealing with a world wide web," said Brenda Zulu, a renowned cyber journalist who specialises in online reporting.   She said the country should first develop a policy on Information Communication Technology (ICT) before rushing to enact legislation on computers.   Currently, the Zambian government is seeking public input in the draft ICT policy, which is yet to be adopted.   "This law is very vague and not necessary for Zambia at the moment," said Lloyd Himambo, an editor of Zambia's online newspaper, The Watchdog.   He said regulating the use of computers will be a difficult undertaking and wondered how such a law will be enforced in Zambia, a country where computers are a preserve of the rich.   About 1 in 1,000 Zambians owns a computer, according to unofficial estimates.   The Computer Society of Zambia agrees that enforcing such a law will be difficult, but pledged to help train police officers to understand cyber crimes.   "I think what people should be fighting for is to upgrade their security features on their websites to deal with hacking but not to criminalise it," said Zulu, adding that hacking a site can be done outside Zambia making it difficult to track the offenders.   A senior Zambian lawyer, who has studied the bill, said it is an "import of the British Act" and lacks local input.   "I think this law is very advanced for the Zambian society and government should not rush it through parliament before reaching consensus," he said, on condition of anonymity.   Source;  AFP.

Islamabad and Johannesburg - The two South Africans held in Pakistan by intelligence agents were caught with a top al-Qaeda operative after a fierce gunbattle at the weekend.   The operative, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, is of the world's most wanted men with a $25-million (about R157-million) price on his head.   He was in custody in Pakistan on Friday for his suspected role in the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.  'It is a big achievement for our security forces'  On Thursday Pakistan's high commissioner in Pretoria, Akbar Zeb, expressed doubt that the two South African men being held captive on suspicion of terrorism activities were only tourists.  They had been granted visas on July 10 to visit Pakistan for "tourism" purposes.  Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad called Zeb in to insist that South Africa's high commission in Pakistan be given consular access to the men.  Zeb assured Pahad that the high commission in Islamabad would be given consular access to the two men "very soon" - once his government's intelligence authorities had completed their initial investigations.  The two South African suspects, believed to be 20-year-old Islamic-studies student Zubair Ismail of Laudium and Feroz Ganchi, reported to be from Fordsburg, were arrested on Sunday along with Ghailani and 13 others.  He is wanted for the death of Americans  They were arrested in a house in the city of Gujrat after a 14-hour gunbattle. Police seized firearms, ammunition, grenades and maps.   But the families of the men in South Africa claim Ismail was in Pakistan to study while Ganchi, a doctor, was there for relief work.   Others said the men were on a hiking expedition.  Zeb dismissed speculation in the South African media that there had been a muddle over the men's identities or that the men arrested had stolen passports from Ganchi and Ismail.  According to Sapa, Pahad met the Ganchi family, at their request, on Wednesday to tell them what the government was doing.  "Ghailani and the others were arrested after the firefight in Gujrat, about 175km south-east of Islamabad, Pakistan Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said.  "It is a big achievement for our security forces," he said.  The US's $25-million reward for the capture of the Tanzanian national is the same bounty offered for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and 19 others on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Most Wanted Terrorist List.  Ghailani is probably the most senior al-Qaeda operative caught in Pakistan since the arrest in March 2003 of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.  "He is wanted for the death of Americans," said an official in Washington on condition of anonymity.  Ghailani, who is in his early 30s and goes by the nicknames "Foopie" and "Ahmed the Tanzanian", was indicted in New York in 1998 for the synchronised blasts that blew up the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people.  Washington blamed al-Qaeda for the devastating bombings and carried out a missile attack on Afghan military training camps run by Bin Laden shortly afterwards. Bin Laden escaped unhurt.  Four al-Qaeda supporters were sentenced to life in prison in October 2001 by a Manhattan federal judge for the bombings.  The FBI and the Manhattan US Attorney's office had no immediate comment on Ghailani's arrest.  Hayat said Pakistani security forces had been acting on a tip-off when they raided a suspected militant hideout in Gujrat. One policeman was slightly wounded in the gunbattle, he added.  Hayat said Ghailani, his Uzbek wife and up to eight other foreigners, including two South Africans, were among those arrested.   Those held included four men, three women and five children, Pakistan's Nation newspaper said today.   "They were strangers, and they acted as such, keeping mostly to themselves," the newspaper said, quoting neighbours.  Pakistan had not yet received a request from the US for Ghailani's extradition, Hayat said.  "He has been in Pakistan for some time. We have to establish the exact nature of his activities and scope of his network in Pakistan.  "Only after we have exhausted our inquiries shall we be able to hand him over to the US."  US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage praised Pakistan's pursuit of al-Qaeda-linked fighters during a visit to Islamabad this month.  US officials suspect that Bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri and other al-Qaeda supporters are hiding somewhere in rugged tribal areas along the Afghan border and have pressured Pakistan to pursue foreign militants in the lawless region.  Up to 600 fighters, including Arabs, Chechens and Uzbeks, are believed to be in the tribal belt, many of them sheltered by tribesmen who have also been involved in fierce clashes with Pakistani troops this year.  Pakistani forces launched two major operations this year in the region after President Pervez Musharraf vowed to clear the country of foreign militants accused of attacks in Pakistan, including two attempts on his life in December, and strikes on US-led forces in Afghanistan.  Pakistan says it has arrested hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters and handed them over to the US since it joined the US-led war on terror in the wake of September 11. - Reuters and Independent News Service.

"An explosion has occurred outside the prosecutor's office," said Svetlana Ardykova, head of the prosecution's press service.  Russia's Interfax news agency quoted an official at the U.S. embassy as saying the blast had been caused by a suicide bomber with explosives attached to his waist.  Israel radio said an explosion had hit its embassy in the capital of the ex-Soviet Central Asian state, killing two local people.  Fifteen people are now standing trial in Tashkent on charges of trying to overthrow the ex-Soviet state in connection with attacks in February that killed nearly 50 people.  The defendants were said to have been followers of the extreme Islamist al Qaeda organization.

Gaby Eid is also believed to have played a role in the purchase of the explosives used in the attacks. At the time of his arrest in Madrid's Carabanchel district, Gaby Eid was carrying forged papers.  Source;  El Pais.

Fox News, for one, reportedly was wildly trying to disguise its trucks by covering up its logos.  The effect of this probably was to make the press even more suspicious of anti-war demonstrators than it already is-to even view them as possible terrorists, and if not actual terrorists, then a crowd within which terrorists could operate.  All of this is taking place in an atmosphere of fear and tension whipped up by the Bush administration, with its reports of Al Qaeda "sleeping cells" preparing to strike against America in the midst of the presidential campaign. (See my July 16 article on a chilling Election Day scenario.)  The white supremacists on the far right have never shown any great interest in the war on terror, and they usually try to use the press, not attack it. Mark Potok, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, which tracks the far right, told Glynn Wilson of the serious-minded Southerner Daily News blog, "We have had no indication whatsoever, not an inkling, that there is any kind of violent action planned by the radical right in Boston. We follow these groups quite closely."  ABC News said last week (basing its report on anonymous sources) that, just before the convention opened on July 23, statements by a domestic group of college-age people in the Midwest triggered the FBI warning, according to Wilson. The ABC report said the group's members had not gone to Boston, Wilson noted. Other warnings of "a very real concern" about impending "violent action by white supremacists" emanated from the Secret Service, the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force, and Boston police, Wilson said.  CNN reported July 23 that "authorities fear that some protesters are preparing to target the media" and that the "Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating." According to the CNN story, the FBI's Boston office issued a statement saying it had "unconfirmed information" that, as CNN put it, "a domestic group plans to attack media vehicles, possibly with 'explosives or incendiary devices.' "  Special Agent Gail A. Marcinkiewicz, the public affairs coordinator for the Boston FBI office, told the Southerner that the report of a "radical domestic terrorist group" planning an attack on media trucks in Boston was "unconfirmed."  Wilson noted that Boston authorities, according to ABC, were worried about two right-wing white supremacist groups in particular: Volksfront and White Revolution. Potok told Wilson that some members of Volksfront pleaded guilty last year in the beating death of a homeless black man, and the Volksfront online bulletin board recently carried a posting urging members to go to Boston and "rally."  "But there was no suggestion whatsoever of any violence," Potok told Wilson, "let alone violence against media trucks. . . . I find it extremely difficult to believe that White Revolution or Volksfront would be involved in an action like this."  Overall, the racist far-right would just love to get some publicity from the war on terror, but these people are stuck in the Stone Age when it comes to weaponry and ideas, and they are definitely not into suicide bombings. Such groups have always tried to manipulate the press, not attack it-except for such rare cases as the neo-Nazis' murder of Denver talk-radio host Alan Berg in 1984.  Source;  Mondo Boston.

Church officials told reporters that Bishop Vacca, of the city of Yopal, was found safe in a small town northeast of Bogotá, the capital. Rebels of the Liberation Army, which was for years led by a Spanish priest, had said they planned to release him with a message to give to the government. But President Álvaro Uribe, whose father was killed by guerrillas, did not wait and ordered troops and helicopters into rugged mountains in northeastern Colombia.  Source;  NYT.

The guns and the bullets are then transported to various parts of the country including Nairobi by donkey carts, trucks and, sometimes, government vehicles.  The research, which is a campaign against small arms by Oxfam - a British development and charitable organisation - says that the weapons come from Ethiopia, which borders Kenya to the North and Somalia which borders Kenya to the East. Others come from Uganda and the volatile Democratic Republic of Congo.  The weapons are picked at the Manyatta Burji-Moyale in Ethiopia. Most of these are normally destined for markets in Eastleigh and Kariobangi North estates in Nairobi, the study, done early this year, says.  Most of this thriving business goes on under the noses of border officials who either look the other way or are too ignorant to know what goes on.  In Mandera, the source of the ammunition and guns is the Suftu area of Ethiopia and Gedo region of Somalia. The entry point is Suftu, Mandera/Somalia border and several other secret routes. The weapons are ferried using donkeys, human couriers and lorries. Most of these find markets in Wajir, Isiolo, Meru, Marsabit and, occasionally, West Pokot.   Unlike in Moyale, ammunition sale in Mandera is done more discreetly. The sale, most of the time, takes place in the middle of the night as opposed to Moyale where business is transacted throughout the day.  The source of ammunition that comes through Wajir is Lower Juba region, Kismayu and Mogadishu  The main entry point is Diff, and through numerous cut lines paved during the oil exploration in the mid 1980s.   The mode of transport is lorries that ferry uncustomed goods from Somalia and human couriers.  Most of the ammunition from Somalia that comes through Mandera is readily gobbled up by Mandera, southern Moyale, eastern part of Marsabit and Wajir north.   In Isiolo, the source of the arms is the Oromo Liberation Front rebels. Others come from Wajir due to the differences between the Ajuran and Degodia community, and also from Kenya Police through the regular and Kenya Police Reservists (homeguards).   The entry points are Merti, Garba Tulla, Modogashe and Habaswein.  In Garissa, the source of the weapons is Somalia, especially the Upper Shabelle and Lower Juba.  The traffickers get in through Diff, Liboi and Daadab and carry their deadly cargo by bus and lorries. Others are disguised as livestock traders.   Most of these arms find their way into Ijara, Tana River, Ukambani and Nairobi.  West Pokot gets its arms from the Democratic Republic of Congo and also Karamojong in Uganda.   The guns, which are used in cattle rustling, enter Pokot through Kacheliba, Alale and Turkwel. A brand new AK-47, the Oxfam report says, can go for as little as Sh10,000 while a bullet can go for even Sh50.  In Samburu, gunrunners get their products from West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, Uganda and Sudan.  They come through Nyahururu, Barsaloi, Baragoi, South Horr, Ngurunit and Archer's Post and find a ready market in Maralal, Barsaloi and Baragoi.   The string of world-class tourist hotels and lodges that dot the banks of Ewaso Ng'iro in Samburu district is a clear testimony that development can flourish in the arid and semi-arid areas. Interestingly, these investments are never attacked despite being in a bandit-prone area.  A member of the Moyale Peace and Reconciliation Committee says that the government's indifference and vast and porous Ethiopian border largely contribute to the spread of small arms in district.  In Moyale this "business" is monopolised by women and truck loaders who transport it to Nairobi concealed as jerry cans carrying old engine oil. Every other day a convoy of nine lorries depart from Moyale carrying an estimated 560 rounds of ammunition.   "I can afford to buy food for my children and that is the basic thing I should provide for them. The rest, like going to school, are luxuries I can't afford to give to them. I don't beg and neither does my husband rob other people," says Marre Hirbo, 38, speaking of her bullet business.   She carries them disguised in a bag of maize seeds and crosses the border nonchalantly in the morning.  She normally picks them from her younger sister's house, a few metres from Moyale-Ethiopia's police headquarters, sandwiched between a mosque and the Ethiopian military barracks.  On the Kenyan side at Manyatta Burji village where her house is, somebody is waiting on the tail of a convoy travelling to Nairobi. Marre buys a jerry can and half fills it with engine oil where her 60 ammunition are dipped, then hidden in the back of a truck for the long journey to Nairobi.  She justifies her trade again: "The government has failed to develop Moyale, what are we expected to do?"  There are more than 16 police roadblocks from Moyale to Nairobi during the day and twice the number at night. Yet the bullets arrive in Nairobi unnoticed.   In Wajir, an intelligence officer monitoring terrorism and other related activities confided that as long as the cut-lines paved during the exploration of oil in the mid-1980's are there, it will be a gigantic task to stop the small arms trade in Wajir and Garissa besides the act of terror itself.  The officer says the region is sitting on a time bomb, adding that there are many illegal activities based on local and cross-border politics as well as others of economic dimension controlled from Somalia going on and can easily be missed by a undiscerning eye.   "Every transaction here is so intricate that it needs a trained eye, a lot of patience and intensive networking to understand and uncover," he adds.  Those who sell their animals to livestock markets in Garba-Tulla, Merti, Modogashe and Sericho transport arms. A bullet normally costs Sh100, says the report.   The guns and ammo are used to protect the animals while on transit to market centres. Once they reach the market, the guns and ammo are sold at the same time the animals are disposed of.  "We have to pay school fees and other needs during the dry season when the prices of our livestock are at the lowest. So once in a while we sell them out of the stock that we keep for emergency," says Aden, a former school teacher.   The proximity of Wajir to Somalia, the little presence of the government and the vastness of the area has made trade in small arms and ammunition so lucrative that it offers alternative employment to local youths.  The proliferation of arms in the area is also attributed to suspicions and conflicts among the four clans that inhabit the district. Each clan controls a constituency.  The story of Garissa will never be complete without mentioning one of the most bloody conflicts in the entire province between the Ogaden/Auhlian and the Abdalla clans of the then greater Garissa before its split into Garissa and Ijara districts.   Two former senior government officials incited leaders of their respective clans to take up arms in what started as a fight over resource control but ended up as territorial battle. Ijara became a district as a result of the bloody war that claimed the lives of many of the "midwives" involved in its birth. Hundreds of arms and thousands of rounds of ammunition were bought from Somalia to the greater Garissa district.  The embers of these clan differences still smoulder, sometimes fanned by the winds from resource pressure, drought and land. However, after the 1997 General Election, there was a lull on the battlefront and peace took root thanks to the Pastoralists Peace and Development Initiative and the posting of Mr Mohammed Saleh, who comes from the region, as Provincial Commissioner. But this initiative was cut short after the transfer of the PC in 2002. Trafficking in ammunition seems to have been reactivated.   Isiolo is in the middle of Kenya. Its position is therefore of strategic importance. Due to its terrain and proximity and easy and fast access to major urban areas, Isiolo is a dream of every military commander. Its weather is ideal for desert warfare. The open spaces are best for the infantry and artillery.  Its seasonal rivers and sandy nature are the most important training ranges for the tanks and combat engineers and the British Army brings its troops for training there too, hence the town is surrounded by four military institutions namely School of Infantry (SOI), School of Combat Engineering near Archer's Post, the 78th Armoured Brigade and the 75th Artillery Battalion based at School of Artillery.   The Isiolo/Moyale Highway is one of the major arteries in the road network systems whose notoriety as a conduit for small arms and ammunition trade is well known to the authorities.  Isiolo is also a rendezvous for arms dealers, traders, travellers and livestock traders from the northern region except Turkana and Tana River. Its location in the heart of Kenya, therefore, is of significant strategic importance.  Ewaso Ng'iro traverses four provinces as it flows and drains into Lorian Swamp in North Eastern Province. The river, which forms one of Kenya's largest basins, is the lifeline of the agriculturists in the upper catchment, the wildlife and tourism in the middle and the pastoralists in the lower area.  These combined factors attract other pastoralists who bring their livestock to Isiolo and hence much pressure is put on the land leading to conflicts. For this reason, many of these pastoralists buy arms to protect themselves or to raid others.   A G3 in Isiolo goes for Sh30,000 while an AK-47 sells at Sh20,000. Bullets from police officers after an operation go for between Sh30-60 but when there is no operation they costs Sh100. They are also sold further afield to the Samburu in Wamba, Archer's Post, Serolipi, the Rendilles of Marille and Laisamis and Turkanas of Baragoi transported by lorries that ferry goods to Marsabit on the Nairobi/Addis Highway.   In 1997, Isiolo was a battle front between the Degodia clan from Wajir West and the Borans after the Degodia, who had come in search of water and pasture for the livestock most of which had been wiped out by a prolonged drought. However, they extended their welcome and the Borans were not amused. The Degodias were armed and so for the Borans to tackle them, they sought weapons from the Ethiopian cousins in the Oromo Liberation Front. A war erupted killing many.   In Samburu East constituency, the British Army had pitched camp and its Artillery and Infantry units practise three times in a year at the Laresoro range a few kilometres outside the sleepy town of Archer's Post.  "The guns in Samburu came from North Eastern Province. The Samburus bought them from the Somalis after we came under attack from several neighbouring tribes," says Sammy Leshore, Samburu East MP.  The chairman of the Samburu Peace Committee, Mr S. Lenairoshi also says people buy bullets from policemen and homeguards. In Alale sub-district of West Pokot the weapons are bought from Uganda - they just walk across the border and back without any hindrance.  In 2003 alone, more than 32,000 people were displaced in Kerio Valley and areas bordering West Pokot due to banditry and cattle rustling activities, recalls Oxfam.   Source;  The Nation (Nairobi).

About two years ago, I visited the US airbase in Bagram, some thirty miles north of the Afghan capital Kabul. A US Army public affairs officer, a friendly Texan, gave me a tour of the sprawling camp, set up after the ouster of the Taliban in December 2001. It was a clear day, and one Chinook helicopter after the other took off to transport combat troops into the nearby mountains. As we walked past the endless rows of tents and men in desert camouflage uniforms, I spotted a wooden pole carrying two makeshift street signs. They read "Exxon Street" and "Petro Boulevard”. Slightly embarrassed, the PA officer explained, "This is the fuel handlers' workplace. The signs are obviously a joke, a sort of irony." As I am sure it was. It just seemed an uncanny sight as I was researching the potential links between the "war on terror" and US oil interests in Central Asia.    Strategic struggle for Wild East   I had already traveled thousands of miles from the Caucasus peaks across the Caspian Sea and the Central Asian plains all the way down to the Afghan Hindu Kush. On that journey I met with and interviewed warlords, diplomats, politicians, generals, and oil bosses. They are all players in a geo-strategic struggle that has become increasingly intertwined with the war on terror: the "New Great Game". In this re-run of the first "Great Game," the nineteenth-century imperial rivalry between the British Empire and czarist Russia, powerful players once again position themselves to control the heart of the Eurasian landmass, left in a post-Soviet power vacuum. Today the US has taken over the leading role from the British. Along with the ever-present Russians, new regional powers such as China, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan have entered the arena, and transnational oil corporations are also pursuing their own interests in a brash, Wild East style. Since 11 September 2001, the Bush Administration has undertaken a massive military buildup in Central Asia, deploying thousands of US troops, not only in Afghanistan but also in the republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia. These first US combat troops on former Soviet territory have dramatically altered the geo-strategic power equations in the region, with Washington trying to seal the Cold War victory against Russia, contain Chinese influence, and tighten the noose around Iran.    Oil giants covet Caspian riches   Most importantly, however, the Bush Administration is using the "war on terror" to further US energy interests in Central Asia. The bad news is that this dramatic geopolitical gamble involving thuggish dictators and corrupt Saudi oil sheiks is likely to produce only more terrorists, jeopardizing US prospects of victory. The main spoils in today's Great Game are the Caspian energy reserves, principally oil and gas. On its shores, and at the bottom of the Caspian Sea, lie the world's biggest untapped fossil fuel resources. Estimates range from 85 to 190 billion barrels of crude, worth up to US$5 trillion. According the US Energy Department, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan alone could sit on more than 130 billion barrels, more than three times the US reserves. Oil giants such as ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, and British Petroleum have already invested more than US$30 billion in new production facilities. The aggressive US pursuit of oil interests in the Caspian did not start with the Bush Administration, but under Clinton who personally conducted oil and pipeline diplomacy with Caspian leaders. US industry leaders were impressed. "I cannot think of a time when we have had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian," declared Dick Cheney in 1998 in a speech to oil industrialists in Washington. Cheney was then still CEO of the oil-services giant Halliburton. In May 2001 Cheney, now US Vice President, recommended in the Administration's seminal National Energy Policy report that "the President make energy security a priority of our trade and foreign policy," singling out the Caspian Basin as a "rapidly growing new area of supply."    Chemical dependency   Keen to outdo Clinton's oil record, the Bush Administration took the new Great Game into its second round. With potential oil production of up to 4.7 million barrels per day by 2010, the Caspian region has become crucial to the US policy of "diversifying energy supply”. The other major supplier is the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, where both the Clinton and the Bush administrations have vigorously developed US oil interests and strengthened ties with corrupt West African regimes. The strategy of supply diversification is designed to wean the US off its dependence on the Arab-dominated OPEC cartel, which has been using its near-monopoly position as leverage against industrialized countries. As global oil consumption keeps surging and many oil wells outside the Middle East are nearing depletion, OPEC is in the long run going to expand its share of the world market even further. At the same time, the US will have to import more than two-thirds of its total energy needs by 2010, mostly from the volatile Middle East. Many people in Washington are particularly uncomfortable with the growing turmoil in Saudi Arabia, whose terror ties have been exposed since the 11 September 2001 terror attacks. As the recent bombings and attacks on oil installations have shown, there is a growing risk that radical Islamist groups could topple the corrupt Saud dynasty, only to then stop the flow of oil to "infidels." The consequences of 8 million barrels of oil - 10 per cent of global production - disappearing from the world markets overnight would be disastrous. Even without any such anti-Western revolution, the Saudi petrol is already, as it were, ideologically contaminated. To supply the ideological deficit left by lack of democracy, the Saudi ruling elite relies on the fundamentalist Wahhabi version of Islam - many of whose preachers see no room for compromise with nations like the US.    Tapping new veins   To escape its Faustian pact with Saudi Arabia, the US has tried to reduce its dependence on Saudi oil sheiks by seeking to secure access to the fabulous oil and gas resources in the Gulf of Guinea and the Caspian. Central Asia, however, is no less volatile than the Middle East, and oil politics are only making matters worse: Fierce conflicts have broken out over pipeline routes from the landlocked Caspian region to high-sea ports. Russia, still regarding itself as imperial overlord of its former colonies, promotes pipeline routes across its territory, notably Chechnya, in the North Caucasus. China, whose dependence on imported oil increases with its rapid industrialization, wants to build eastbound pipelines from Kazakhstan. Iran is offering its pipeline network for exports via the Persian Gulf. By contrast, both the Clinton and Bush administrations have championed two pipelines that would avoid both Russia and Iran. One of them, first planned by the US oil company Unocal in the mid-1990s, would run from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to the Pakistani port of Gwadar on the Indian Ocean. Several months after the US-led overthrow of the Taliban regime Afghan President Hamid Karzai, a former Unocal adviser, signed a treaty with Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf and the Turkmen dictator Saparmurat Niazov to authorize construction of a US$3.2 billion gas pipeline through the Herat-Kandahar corridor in Afghanistan, with a projected capacity of about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas per year. A feasibility study is under way, and a parallel pipeline for oil is also planned for a later stage. So far, however, continuing warlordism in Afghanistan has prevented any private investor from coming forward. Construction has already begun on a gigantic, $3.8 billion oil pipeline from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku via neighboring Georgia to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. British Petroleum Amoco, its main operator, has invested billions in oil-rich Azerbaijan and can count on firm political support from the Bush Administration, which stationed about 500 elite troops in war-torn Georgia in May 2002.    Pipeline perpetuates instability   Controversial for environmental and social reasons, as it is unlikely to alleviate poverty in the notoriously corrupt transit countries, the pipeline project also perpetuates instability in the South Caucasus. With thousands of Russian troops still stationed in Georgia and Armenia, Moscow has for years sought to deter Western pipeline investors by fomenting bloody ethnic conflicts near the pipeline route, in the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan and in the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjaria. Washington's Great Game opponents in Moscow and Beijing resent the dramatically growing US influence in their strategic backyard. Worried that the US presence might encourage internal unrest in its predominantly Muslim Central Asian province of Xingjian, China has recently held joint military exercises with Kyrgyzstan. The Russian government initially tolerated the US intrusion into its former empire, hoping Washington would in turn ignore Russian atrocities in Chechnya. However, for the Kremlin, the much-hyped "new strategic partnership" against terror between the Kremlin and the White House has always been little more than a tactical and temporary marriage of convenience to allow Russia's battered economy to recover with the help of capital from Western companies. It is unthinkable for the majority of the Russian establishment to permanently cede its hegemonic claims on Central Asia. Russia's Defense Ministry has repeatedly demanded that the US pull out of Russia's backyard within two years. Significantly, President Putin has signed new security pacts with the Central Asian rulers and last October personally opened a new Russian military base in Kyrgyzstan. It is the first base Moscow has set up outside Russia's borders since the end of the cold war. Equipped with fighter jets, it lies only thirty-five miles away from the US airbase.    Strange bedfellows   Besides raising the specter of interstate conflict, the Bush Administration's energy imperialism jeopardizes the few successes in the war on terror. That is because the resentment US policies cause in Central Asia makes it easier for al Qaida-like organizations to recruit new fighters. They hate the US because in its search for antiterrorist allies in the new Great Game, the Bush Administration has wooed some of the region's most brutal autocrats, including Azerbaijan's Heidar Aliev, Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbaev and Pakistan's Musharraf. The most tyrannical of Washington's new allies is Islam Karimov, the former Stalinist dictator of Uzbekistan who allowed US troops to set up a large and permanent military base on Uzbek soil during the Afghan campaign in late 2001. Ever since, the Bush Administration has turned a blind eye to the Karimov regime's brutal suppression of opposition and Islamic groups. "Such people must be shot in the head. If necessary, I will shoot them myself," Karimov once famously told his rubber-stamp parliament. Although the US State Department acknowledges that Uzbek security forces use "torture as a routine investigation technique," Washington in 2002 gave the Karimov regime US$500 million in aid and rent payments for the US airbase in Khanabad. Though Uzbek Muslims can be arrested simply for wearing a long beard, the State Department also quietly removed Uzbekistan from its annual list of countries where freedom of religion is under threat. Even though the US this year held back US$18 million in aid, Powell assured Karimov he was still in their good books. "Uzbekistan is an important partner of the United States in the war on terror and we have many shared strategic goals. This decision does not mean that either our interests in the region or our desire for continued cooperation with Uzbekistan has changed," the State Department said. The current US policy of aiding Central Asian tyrants for the sake of oil politics repeats the very same mistakes that gave rise to bin Ladenism in the 1980s and 1990s because their disgusted subjects increasingly embrace militant Islam and virulent anti-Americanism. Tellingly, Uzbekistan has recently seen a sharp increase in terrorist activities, with several bomb attacks shaking Tashkent in April, including the first-ever suicide bombings in Central Asia. More than forty people died in gun battles between the terrorists and security forces.    Alternatives to fossil fuels needed   The 11 September attacks have shown that the US government can no longer afford to be indifferent toward how badly dictators in the Middle East and Central Asia treat their people, as long as they keep the oil flowing. So, while the war on terror may not be all about oil, certainly in one sense it should be about just that. A bold policy to reduce the addiction to oil would be a wise strategy to win the epic struggle against terrorism. In the short term, this means saving energy through more efficient technologies, necessary anyway to slow the greenhouse effect and global warming. The Bush Administration's old-style energy policies of yet more fossil-fuel production and waste are continuing in the wrong direction. It is time to realize that more gas-guzzling Hummers on US highways only lead to more Humvees (and US soldiers) near oilfields. What is urgently needed instead - for security reasons - is a sustainable alternative energy policy. Ultimately, no matter how cleverly the US plays its cards in the New Great Game in Central Asia and no matter how many military forces are deployed to protect oilfields and pipelines, the oil infrastructure might prove too vulnerable to terrorist attacks to guarantee a stable supply anyway. The Caspian region may be the next big gas station but, as in the Middle East, there are already a lot of men running around throwing matches.  Write; by Yuumei. July 04
