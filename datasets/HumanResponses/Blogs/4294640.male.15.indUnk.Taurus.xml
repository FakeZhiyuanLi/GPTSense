      hello all.  foodle wants me to make a disclaimer before I put this onto his blog, so I shall now:  this is me stoned at roughly 2:00AM to 3:40AM.  I got home, blogged like a fiend, and then went to bed to sleep off my influenciosity.  You can see evidence of this post having been on my blog  urlLink here .  anyways, here is random blog of stoned-ness.   gotta finish this post before this stuff wears off  I regret to inform you, that I am currently stoned. Silly Kevin and Foo, you should have known better than to send me off with Paddy! and his ohh-so-West Coast, pot-smoking ways... (take that, Mr. Lt. David of the I don't know where British Columbia is kind Chin!) second time in two days. I'm a pathetic human being with no will power, and a desire to get away from my horrid expectations of myself. *But is weed the answer children? survey says: yes.* I take no responsibility for this post, I thought it was funny when I wrote it. I want all who read this blog to be happy and laughing while they read my blog so that they like, it and keep coming back for more. (wow that sentence got forgotten, and it took me like a full minute to retrieve it from the depths of my brain; it's kind of liking losing luggage to the airports (Nazis), and then having to wait a year or more, and give up on it, and then get it mailed to you, after you've bought your men's shaving cream, and Braun face razor, and new pairs of jocky shorts, which is the same amount of annoyance on the annoyance scale.) (wow, that mosquito was enormous! made it easy to swat, though. Their getting ginormous in Canada! (*putting on astonished rancher-girl voice*) quick Cletis, get the gun, the parasitic aliens have already taken the mosquitos, and are ready to start their transfer to the human race through the cardio vascular system!) (that was a muscle, not a system) (yikes, that entire previous paragraph was read in my mind in a horrified Aunt-May-from-Spiderman-but thirty-five years earlier, offended voice) All this stuff is nothing but excerpts from all the thoughts I'm making, except for the editorial, boring ones (you know like that's missing a pee, that's supposed to have a cue, this is a better word. you don't need to knw about that.) However, obviously I am babbling, and as such a babbler, I am physically obligated (by my sever lack of control, or judgment systems as made inebriated by the substance I have been smoking) to tell anyone anything about me...like Paddy asked if I was good at blow jobs (though in not so many words), and I was like fuck you (i don't think I said that, but I was sober enough then (a little) to be able to kind of mutter it away). but that's a rare case, usually, I'm like, I blab all. stupid pot. Every few seconds, I just keep going off on tangents then losing my thought train (plenty good room on the glory train, there's a ...) and it's frusterating. hmmm. deep breaths. the ghost who doesn't like Sherayna is giving me such a disapproving glare. She's from a really old period of time that view divorce as a stain against the soul, and as such does not like Sherayna, and now I suppose she doesn't like me because I'm gross and pot-ty (ha I said potty) I wonder if the neighbors next door can tap into my computer screen using secret government hack softwear for spying? that would suck, cause they might be able to pull up my recieved files folder or something and--ooh--know what I've been talking about. tricksy hobbits. you think ghosts or spirits can move the physical elemental molocules around in a way similar the god-like capacity to create to create something like a birth of a monster? what if he hated pot smokers, and burned 'em all up with his super-mollecular powers cause he was a ghost and could? he'd be so antisocial! (that cracked me up!) I hope you all laugh when you read this. cause maybe if you're laughing and having fun you won't be so condemning of me having the same fun you are having. That = no getting hurt. I miss my Capricorn bracelet. wait, that was a necklace. w/e. he hates me, I suppose I hate him now. Although I would hate to have to hate the memories. There'r some good ones. I wonder how embarrassed I'm going to betomorroow? cause this is pretty uncensored, basically all that's going into my head is poo-fing right out of my mouth and onto paper. (but I'm not talking! ooh! talented!) does that make me honest or does that make me cheap? you tell me. cause then I won't have to be the one who has to intuit what every one has said for everyone else. I'm making some major psychological breakthroughs here in my head, but everytime I formulate my plan to put it down on paper, it eludes me! Like for instance: what was I just thinking about? something about me--NO! me getting psychologically less--dependent? no. guilty? no...what was that? nope, can't remember by rereading the text. if I were speaking I would probably be slurring. The problem is I keep making thoughts to fast for fingers to write, then I lose them cause I'm onto another thought, and my hangs are screaming "mayday, mayday, we have to make sure all this info is getting out to all your readers out there in blogland! they need to know! (Brianna-like wail) They need to KNOOOOOWWWW!" their the captains of the ship, and they're going dooooooo oooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooown... I hope you appreciate the effort, cause my BACK is achin! *limps off to Electric Lettuce* what's that? electric lettuce you say? why there? because that's where I should go cause I SMOKE POT! AND IT'S A FRIENDLY ENVIROMENT! I love stoners. It's like a jail for stoners, albeit an amusing one. --**referring to the previous topic** back is on fire. ghost is gone. ok, wtf? what is she planning? shit, I'm going to die in my bed tonight. Victorian gals, were final in their decisions. And I mean FINAL. I should go to bed, but I DON'T wanna. I can't wait to have comments. Though everyone is going to be disappointed in me. Jeepers. What do I have, a posse ful of parents? shitty end of the stick here, who's taking? my laughs smell like pot. I'm such a pot head. Foo might not think so, but he knows I haven't done pot much. Shit man, I need AA. and the one for marijuana. I thought I heard the sound of a police radio announcer talking on my way home w/ Paddy, but really it was his car stereo. it freaked me out. I thought I was psychic, and there were cops on our tail cause we were fucking stoners. But it wqas just my influenced influenced imagination, which could be a message from my subconcious about the psychological breakthroughs (hey! this is what I was thinking earlier!) I'm having in my high. My psychological breakthroughs are that-fuckk where'd it go. I was trying to retrieve that thought for a full ahlf an hour! I'm a fucking blond dog!--my psychological breakthroughs are: that I am...wait, it's coming...(hey it's like an orgasm, but wait if that's true, then it means the thought will never come, because I never...you get the idea) (I hoope Laura laughs at this)...ok. that I am...stoned for sure (that's sounds so badly simpleton). there are more things that I am that aren't positive...something that is related to: SHIT! I totally had it, too! fucking thoughts. paranoid!!! for one thing! that was part of it, I am paranoid. For what? well cause I'm ego centric for one thing, but that wasn't the important thing....what was te important thing (you know if I do this much soul-searchin while I'm supposed to be out getting stoned (read: having illegal illegal fun with drugs and alchohol) (hey, I just ried to spell stoned and got the middle three letters wrong!) fuck, another one got forgotten. and I really wanted to tell you that one too, cause it was cool, you would ahve liked it--OH YEAH! fuck it's gone again. OH YEAH! that I...should live along, I think? no, no it was something else related to you guys enjoying my blog or soemthing. not too sure, wow am I needy, it had something to do with that do, wow this sentence is turning into a big old witches brew for concepts. I'm probably lying about a few of these things to you cause I'm stoned. I am going to PASS OUT at this computer, I'm so fucked u[p. OH YEAH! cause it's good to have you guys, (read: my blog of lonliness) so that I can have a private place to make me feel like I'm safe and that nobody is reading this, but am really not so I can express my self, and only feel a little mortified about it that usual. I don't like telling epopelt hingsa bout me cause I'm...paranoid. and stoned... I keep thinkiing my desk is wider than it--oh yeahh! SHIT! gone again--OH YEAH! FUCK IT KEEPS GETTING LOST INT THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO TYPE OH YEAH! SOMETHING...ME WHINING AND YOU NOT CQARE? NO..UM...YOU NOT REAL? MAYBE THAT WAS IT. THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR! fuckin caps lock. owie back... \sooooooooo random, radnom blog of random blogness. random random random, Angie, should likeit she's always saying how she likes random stuff. But she probably disapproves, cause everybody disapproves but Foo and Paddy. Even "Rod" disapproved I think cause it was me, and maybe he's heard something from asshole Chris Read. asshole asshole. wish I had Laura and Gareth here to carry me around like the cast party. even though I know it was Ty carrying me around then. but right now I want Gareth. and Laura. they're going to disapprove... i like this post...it's even more honest that I usually am, and I'm sure some of you would like that...and some of you will hate me. I really hope the religious ones don't start to hate me. cause I'm just mistaking by sinning, both are fixeable. An anyway, no babies yet, and no unprotected sex =ing STD yucky yucky herpes. play the D note, Giles. her-pes her-pes her-res her-pes her-pes. I really hope Laura laughs at this stuff, cause she's the only what about whom I'm positive that they'll laugh when they read this and not be angry. I can feel the ghost Voctorian's energy, boiling into a cold frenzy around one of my feet. fuck. better not be trying to possess me. I know I sound like a stoned rambler, but check what I say in a good Wicca book they'll confirm what I say./ Still taste like pot. or maybe that energy is a bite from a parasitic alien-ridden mosquito, and that's just my DNA breaking down in my foot, and becoming the aliens??? she's getting more intense, and closer. I can feel her anger. she's so cold. it's not a cold of this world (god that sound sappy, but I'm just putting down what comes through!) I feel like my voice is changing to something that has not been heard for a hundred years or more. is this a possession? can it please not be messy and epilectic like the other ones? I can deal with being your vessel, but ot your slave. fuck I'm wasted. she's got my foot, and I'm curious and aprehensive to know what she wants to do with it. This is all probably the pot speaking. Because I make disclaimer, does that maake me lying? these thoughts are in my voice, the other creepy thoughts I was sayign in a different voice. I can feel her returning. I had no acid tonight, I didn't know weed created hallucinations. This is not a Hallucination. This is the BBBBBOOOOgEEEY MAAAAANNN (oops, forgot the G.) weaRING OFF NOW. I can hear country music in my head. stuff my grampa listens to. I'm fucking basted. haha! mixed too synonyms with stoned into a new word! I need an urban dictionary. ok, there are two explanations. Either this is all happening cause I'm yucky, and hallucinating, and faking all out. Or, it's all real supernatural shit, and it's only my friends whop aren't goign to believe me when they read this blog. which should I choose? the one kinda proves the other cause what supernatural guy would want a girl to know her friends believed her about them? no guys want that. they want to be mr mysterious,. wham-bam-thank you ma'am. even the ghosts are. slap across the face, your possessed/fucked-and-pregnant, and they don't FUCKING CARE HOW YOU FEEL! wow I am obnoxiously unsober. thank good ness MoM strong sleeper. wearing off more. slightly more coherent. there's a war going on in here, and the spoils are my body. I'll lose to either the drugs or the ghost, whichever one this happens to be. Could be both, could neither. maybe I've finally gone insane. In the still of the night. I held you. Held you tight. Oh I love. Love you so. Promise I'll never let you. In the still of the night. ooooh-ooooh-oooooooh, woop woopwwooooo oooh, bee oooh, Sincerely. oh I know how you love me (haha) cause I love you so dearly. oh whoa whoa please say....you'll be mine like a freaky oldies record playing out to the rest of my life. good records that I like. I can hear Sincerely, but as me and Brianna and Laura singing it but recorded in nineteen forty four. I can't fall asleep other wise I'll die./ If I fall asleep, either the ghost will steal my body and take it over like Prom Night 2, Hello Mary Lou, oooorrr the drugs will cause me to have a heart attack and die, thus fucking shit up. for the past like three hours, my attention has been superglued to this key board, not even to the screen. it's like the keyboard is my life line, my key to all thigs physical and this life, giving me glorious words of creation. (ok, so that was funny) fuckin shitty deal! I have to sign out of Sherayna's msn,a nd then LOG into my own, adn she's already online, and she's an internet slob, and it's a big hassle to have to dot hat everytime you change computer users. too much work. I wonder if this post is as long yet as my trip post? can find character counts in fULL pERSONALLITY PROFILE, I BELIEVE. fuck, caps lock rememeber this:  urlLink http://www.ratemyteachers.ca/  it's a link Amanda sent me and I should look at it, adn she's talking to me. rememeber it. too baked to do it noooooowww. I can't spell. fucking stoned. no longer positive of immentent possession and or takeover. yeah fuck, now I'm afraid that this is being cause d by the aliens. cause that presents an element of the unknown, and ghosts pose more of a similiar, I-can-read-about-your-kind-in-a-textbook-somewherw kinda way, and Aliens are entirely unknown, making them scarier. I wanna post now, buh bye. beebur. brianna. banana. bbebur bananabriannablack. goodnight night.

      this times not quite a million.  but for sure badness.  Alleah got the foodle sick.  Alleah feels bad about that.  Foo's diary reads, "badness!  I'm sick with what Alleah had.  Now how did I get that?"  yesterday was tons of fun.  Alleah, and Lo-Bo came over to the foodle's domicile, but they got distracted by Melly Belly.  and ended up being four hours late.  meh.  they eventually arrived, and me, Laura-Gator, the foodle, and 'lexis-girl went bush jumping (surprisingly amusing), and sitting on other people's lawns.  the foodle and I tackled each other constantly.  I have discovered that a lower centre of balance because of being a woman, coupled with intense shortness equals lots of tackling fun.  I've discovered that there is a distinctive difference between my typing and the foodle's typing.  I capitilize, and he does not.  hahaha.  ok, so it's not that funny.  Alleah discovered a sweet ass book yesterday.  it's called Oopsy Daisy's Bad Day, and it's all about bad trips.  Her cereal hates her.  It's alphabits, and they spell I Hate You, and it's funny.  this blog is surprisingly incoherent.  Surprising, because Alleah is writing this, not the foo.  You would think that with Alleah typing there would be some point, but no, no there isn't.  foo is on the phone right now, and we keep sniffing at the exact same time.    no smokes to smoke no drugs to toke and alchohol makes me choke.  that is why i'm bored. from the foo

      Foo has just made a blog like all the other blogging whores.  Woo-hoo!  Foo is also talking in third person, because...he's Foo.  OK, you caught me, this is actually Alleah who created the blog FOR him, because he is without computer currently.  Somehow I'm going to have to remember his password and username cause he won't.  PALINDROME!!!  Foo, and I are palindrome buddies.  air five, Foo!  Anna.  hannah.  race car. 23:32.  he says, "sux0r mux0r."  hey!  nobody ever said this blog would be coherent.  anyways, Alleah, Blog Creator of God-hood is off to see if she can remember Foo's username and password!  which I won't!  boo-yeah!  see you all on  urlLink my blog , which we all know is the originator of cool blogs.  buh bye, all!  oh, and Foo?  I reserve the right to post on this blog at any time night or day, just because I know your password.  tyrancy in kingdom blog!
