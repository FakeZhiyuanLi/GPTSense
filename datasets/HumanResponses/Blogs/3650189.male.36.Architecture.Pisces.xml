      I would have to admit, I had thought of myself in recent years as a semi-rabid member of Red Sox Nation. I was proven incorrect yesterday as I drove to work listening to WEEI FM. I witnessed at the beginning of the "Dale and Neumy" show the reason why the Yankees are better than the Red Sox. They don't care as much. The only time that Yankees fans care about anything is when A: a member of The Nation has the nerve to talk about their team, anywhere in the world might I add, and B: when the Yankees are in the world series. Dale, and countless others who reside in The Nation predicted a sweep of the Yankees in the Bronx, IN JULY? These are the idiots that the Red Sox are playing to. It's no wonder that the Sox can never live up to the expectations.   What's going on in the other dugout? The Yankees are preparing for another series against another team, and don't see any need to juggle their rotation to take on the Mighty Red Sox, so they'll just throw the bottom of their rotation and move on to the next series against The Mets and throw Mussina, Contraras, and Vazquez. Two series wins, and no down side.The Yanks can slide into Detroit take another series and head into the All-Star break with a commanding lead.  Meanwhile, we get a loss behind Lowe who might be writing off his last year in Boston, or might be pissed off that the media can't see that his ego needs a little stroke and start referring to the Sox as a three ace team, followed by Mr. Shakey ground Wakefield tonight and Pedro for the final game. The team then travels to Atlanta and hosts Oakland and Texas with only Oakland forced to face the one two punch could get ugly before the second half starts. The Red Sox could be looking into an insurmountable lead by the Yankees, and playing catch up to the wild card for the rest of the season.  The Red Sox need to forget about the Yankees and move on. There are 162 games in the season, and only 19 games against the Yankees that leaves 143 games that you could concentrate on. If you should happen to win a few of those 19 games than that would be just peachy. Without the 19 games, there is still plenty of room for losing series, and splitting, and winning a few against the usual suspects. 101 out of 143 isn't impossible it is difficult, but winning is difficult, and if we have to write off a rivalry to win, then so be it.  there's still time to send the message that we no longer care about the Yankees. Call up two young pitchers from Pawtucket to take the hit of these last two games against the Yanks, and get the rotation square to win the three series that follow and hit the all-star break running. There are 87 games remaining in the schedule 11 remaining against the Yankees that leaves 76 games in which to win 58 for a truly great season. Keep focused on the real goal, don't be distracted by the aura and mystique, and keep beating everyone else out there. There's plenty of time to beat the Yankees when it matters.

      Ya know...Ted's just not been himself. He's usually so gregarious, especially with the young ladies. I'm a little worried that there might be something wrong. I think he should try to settle down with one of those cute young co-eds we always see him with. I just never see him with the same girl twice. I can't figure it out, it's like they just disappear.

      Pete reminds me of my own ailing body, so I thought I should relay my own tale of an incident that occurred last weeks much to the dismay of my own muscular structure.  From time to time in my line of work as you may know, I am require to go to a job site and check on the the progress of the construction at that site. Last Friday, my body reminded me that I am 36 years old, and inching closer to the day that I just won't do certain things anymore. I was on a site to confer with the framer on a different matter, but had been told that the cupola of this seaside home had been framed and that the view was fabulous, I just had to go up there before they render it inaccessible for a time while working on other areas of the project.  All things being equal it is a great view. It was just a little more inaccessible than I had imagined. I was told that I would have to go up to the second floor via the stairs, and then climb a step ladder t the attic level. Once at the attic level, they had constructed "steps" to get up to the cupola. I do have to admit that I am a bit fearful of heights, and the whole thing sounded a little too easy, but I have been working on this project since it began so I couldn't be the only one to have not afforded themselves of the view just because I was scared; meow.  I got to the attic level just fine in spite of having to step on the top step of the ladder which we all know is not a step. I looked around and at first it seemed as if there were no steps up to the cupola, but as I looked closer I noticed that there were 2x4's nailed to the roof rafters so that you could walk up them in either ladder fashion using your hands and all bent over, or walk straight up on the edges of the 2x4's. To get to the "ladder" one would have to walk across the 1-1/2" thick ceiling joists of the attic(no floor yet). The incident however didn't happen until I had the balls to try to get back down from the precarious position that I had been encouraged to get into.  Once I faced my fear of falling the nearly 20 feet from the cupola down through the framing onto the hard floor of the master bedroom, after I had gingerly tip-toed my way across the ceiling joist for a second time, I was getting onto the top non-step of the step ladder and as I transferred weight onto my foot that was now on the step ladder it started to walk across the floor. I did what any fearful man would have done and began climbing down this walking ladder thinking that it would be better to fall six feet than to have to jump down from twelve feet once the ladder had disappeared. I arrived safely on the second floor and after helping a co-worker with the ladder, I made my way safely back to the office.  The next morning and for the next four days, I awoke to the unmistakable twinge of a muscle pull. FROM WALKING DOWN A LADDER. We are getting old aren't we?

      OK, I'm 38 years old.  I just played softball, in a league, last night.  For the first time in 15 years.  And it was good.  Dire warnings of my body not being able to handle it did not come to fruition.  Alright, I didn't get to play much.  There were 19 people on the team who showed up for the first game.  Most of them know each other and I never went to one practice.  They didn't know me at all.  So other people played in front of me.  I pretty much anticipated that.  but I did learn something about myself-  I HATE to sit on the bench.  I was cool about it and I understood.  But as I sat there I definitely felt the same juices flowing that have always made me want to play every inning of every game.  And the game should last for at least six hours. As it was, these are only 50 minute games.  We had a late game, but I still tested my body in the Texas heat during warm ups.  I sweat through my t-shirt in about a half hour of running around.  Did I really test my body?  Well, as much as I could.  With 19 people and me not starting and such a short game time, I got subbed in, in the third inning- at DH.  We did most of the batting as we won 13-4 against a pretty disorganized team.  Anyway, here's what actually happened with our hero: I came to the plate a runner on first and two outs in the third.  Took the first pitch for a stike just to see one and settle in (after 15 years of no live competition remember).  I had picked out the sorriest looking girl (yes a mixed league) in right field and decided to hit out to her and see how far I could run.  On the second pitch, I hit a liner right at the umpire standing between first and second.  As I figured, at that point, instincts kicked in, my mind thought one thing and my body just started trying to do it.  I had hit it a little more left than intended, so the (male) right-centerfielder actually got it and fielded it pretty cleanly.  The mind was off to the races and it soon looked around and found the body  moving toward second.  Possible close play, but the throw was a bit off.  A clean double, runner moved to third.  Now, I suppose I must come clean about the "landing" at second.  I couldn't find cleats, so I was just wearing some tennis shoes.  The field was this kind of powdery moon-dust crap.  When my smooth sneaker stepped on the moon-dust on top of the second base bag, my leg locked and my foot slipped, I fell.  No blood, no foul.  I was safe.  And dirty.  Everything was good.  Second and third two outs, our (female) coach up next.  She hits a liner to left and the body is following the mind again.  With two outs, I'm off with the hit and ready to challenge the lack of fielding ability on the other team.  I'm headed for home.  With the play behind me, I can sense that the timing is right for a play at the plate if they want to, but I can't see if they're going for it.  I'm looking at the catcher for visual clues and not getting any.  She's standing straight up (almost ON the plate, by the way) as if watching something that's not about to come near her.  I'm running, I'm watching, getting closer, no indication of change, I decide to go in standing up.  As I commit to standing up, and coming in a little awkward because she's standing over the plate- and I'm trying to touch it- she finally moves.  The ball IS coming to the plate and I don't see it yet.  She jumps, I duck, stick my foot out to touch the plate.  I'm safe.  But I'm also off balance at full speed.  I get feet under me for about two more steps and then fall ass-over-tea kettle on the ground.  Felt a little silly.  But good.  Time ran out after the fourth inning and I never got in the field.  Promises were made of more playing time next game for those who didn't get much.  Eight games total, so I may only get 10 or 12 at bats all season, we'll see.  I ran around during warm ups.  I was 1 for 1 with a double and a run scored and, while I can feel some bumps and soreness, I didn't get banged up too bad.  Overall, pretty pleased with my first time back.  Hopefully, not as many people will show up for every game and I'll start to take over on this team...

      Wow!  Jim's angry.  That's OK.  I pretty much hate the world myself.  Well, not the world, I guess.  Just the residents.  I'm not as angry about politics, although I have found myself hating almost all the policians in the last few years.  It's all about the bipartisanship!    I don't like any of my choices.  Gregg, what did we do at ECSU when we didn't like any of the meal choices in the cafeteria that day?  "Just make me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."  Well, pass the bread.  I'm  ready to hit the salad bar and steal some cereal to take back to my room.  BTW- I hope you guys are getting the same pop-up ads at the top of this page selling Ronald Reagan caps and commemorative framed coins as I am.  They're the perfect tie in to irate comments about Ronny.  I hope we don't make this  all  so serious.  Quick, somebody blog something funny...

      Hey, congratulations to another bunch of thugged out playas from Detroit! I never thought I'd see the day that Storrs, Connecticut would out mayhem the motor city. What has happened to the City of Detroit and their rabid fans of violent jubilation? Perhaps their grandfather, Bill Davidson calmed their nerves by wearing his Rainman outfit to the game. In any case, more cars were overturned and burned in Storrs, Connecticut after the UCONN men won their NCAA championship than were last night in Detroit. I hate to sound disappointed, but I guess I am. There's always hope that the victory parade will turn ugly.

      It has been announced that the U.S. will not turn over sovereignty on June 30th as has been previously promised. The new date for the turn over has been set as July 1rst. I am at a loss to try to figure out what can be accomplished in a day. The only things that can come of one more day are: one more attack against innocent 'Merican soldiers, and one more assassinated member of the new Iraqi Government. Perhaps the Bushies are waiting for enough of the Iraqi Governing Council to get killed off that they can "hand the keys" over to their guy. Chalabi could probably play that betrayal myth al the way to the number one position and become the new autocratic ruler of a "Free and Sovereign Iraq"  I wouldn't put it past another American leader to install another dictator in another country in the Middle East so we can fight this war again in another 20 years.

       Am I to take this seriously?  Let me get this straight...Bush is down in the polls against Kerry, the numbers on the reported job growth are being crunched and it looks like the three million people who lost their jobs in the first three years will get new jobs to the tune of about $9000 less per year than the jobs that they lost, There's still no sign of Osama, and they expect me to believe that there is someone rambling around Columbus Ohio plotting to bomb a mall? Who's linked to Al Quida? I've been to Columbus and there is nothing spectacular about Columbus with the exception that Ohioans are amongst the last in our country to make up their minds about the course our country should plot for the next four years.  I watched 1984 last night and I don't normally tie things like this together, but Big Brother is trying to get re-elected people, and He's shoving the red hot Homeland Security poker right up the collective ass of Ohioans.   The irony that a major terra plot has been foiled in one of the key electoral college states has not been lost on me, so you can go peddle your crazy elsewhere, I'm all stocked up here.    In two weeks I'm going to predict that another terra plot or "potential" terra attack will be thwarted in California, and then again in two weeks in Florida. Does anyone else remember the two missing gas trucks that were all over the news before Reagan died and sucked all of the oxygen out of any real news stories out there? They were missing for an entire weekend and then miraculously disappeared. TEXAS, 'nough said. Ohio, California, Florida, then on to the "swing states" like Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado. Then we can start rumors in Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and New Hampshire.     Get ready, hold on to your seats, because this summer your going to have the crap scared out of you to a homeland near you, from the producers of the patriot act, and the patriot act 2, from the director of homeland security comes a campaign like no other, a campaign designed to keep you in the dark, scared shitless, without the will to fight back. If you thought 9-11 had you freakin out just wait until the threat gets mentioned in a town near you, by government officials.    I know that I'm just begging for the thought police to break down the door and haul me off to room 101, but I find it a little interesting that this "government" of duly appointed stooges, is suddenly thwarting terra attempts in key states like Texas and Ohio. There is no resistance, There is only the government, and its separate but willing propaganda machine, re-writing the language until dissenting opinions are no longer classified as free speech, and we all work in dingy grey cubicles, in dingy grey coveralls. The one thing you can never control is The Human Spirit.

      Firstly, I must admit that the leader of the empire had a good speach day last week in eulogizing Mr. Reagan, but much like his reaction to "The tragic events of September 11th"tm, this was another slam dunk opportunity that was capitalized on.  The next thing on the day's agenda is the organization of former diplomats and military leaders who have had the courage, in spite of their past allegiances to folks like Pres. Reagan, and Pres. Bush, and Pres. Clinton, to stand up and speak out against the foreign (think furin) policy of the Imperial Leader and advocate regime change.  http://www.therandirhodesshow.com/todays_show.html

       Who was the better American Ronald Reagan OR Ray Charles?   I submit to you dear friends that I would prefer to have a national day of mourning for Ray Charles than for Ronny. I would prefer to have a day of mourning for Ronny Milsap than Ronald Reagan. The idea that the neocons think they can fool us into thinking that Ronald Reagan was the best damn President ever, deflecting our attention and more importantly the attention of the national media from all of the shit storm of Iraq is making me ill. Ronald Reagan may have been the one who most accurately predicted the fall of the soviet union; that was fun and all, and he did manage to put a little "jingo juice" into all of our juice boxes and make us proud to be americans again (if your a neocon read 'mericans agin). That was good, I'll admit it, the guy had balls. Here's what I see to be the real shame of Reagans death. With all of the 24 hour coverage of the death one would think that they could get the village idiot to sit down in front of a t.v. and maybe learn a little something about how to be a popular president. When our marines were killed by terrorist attack under Reagan's watch what happened? Reagan took responsibility for the lack of security and good intelligence, and started an independant panel to discover the breeches of security in order to fix the problem and did something about it. I know that everyone in the current administration has been telling me for the last three years how sart George is, but I still don't buy it. It is ridiculous that an abject moron like George Bush should be allowed to co-opt the legacy of a man far better than he for political gain.  I can't wait to listen to GWB to slaughter the language in giving this Great 'Merican's Eulogy on Friday.
