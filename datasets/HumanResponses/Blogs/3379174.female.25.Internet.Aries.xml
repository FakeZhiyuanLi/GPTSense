      I'm currently trying to learn about tarot. Something that I'm admittedly not so interested in. I'd rather work with other tools of divination, but I feel that there is a lot that I could learn through at least  knowing  about tarot.   So the suggested route to learning is to look at the cards, and write down your interpretation of them. I definitely didn't help myself by asking for the mermaid tarot (and recieving it). From what I've heard it's a more "advanced" deck. Well I've never gone about learning anything the easy way, so I guess this fits with my pattern.   Onto my interpretations, shall we? First the Fool.  I've been told that the fool represents the beginning of a journey. I suppose then, that it's fitting that I begin this journal with this card.   What I see in this card is a picture of a beautiful mermaid, she's reclining, almost as if she were falling, or drifting in the ocean currents. She's wearing the jesters cap, which with the small smile she has, tells me that she laughs at everything. The saying "not a care in the world" comes to mind. There is a small red fish sucking or biting her near the end of the tail which made me think that she's probably used to kissing up to those more influential and powerful than she is. There are shining red pearls of something floating around her, almost like pearls of knowledge, there for her to grasp, if only she wanted to.   The Fool is the 0 card in the deck. The beginning, but also the ending? I look at her face, and wish I could live such a carefree life, free to float and drift. To dream.

      I've walked many pathways in my life, and they have brought me various places. This journal is to chronical my journeys, and lessons in life.   Specifically, I'm newly walking on my path of spirituality. Where I stand now is at a crossroads, where I leave Christianity, and walk forward into paganism. Where this path will take me, I don't know, but getting there has always been half the fun.

      I guess I effectively let my procrastination about tarot put a halt on this journal. That's not good!  I don't want to stop writing just because I'm not interested in the tarot, so I won't let it stop me. If I do my tarot stuff fine, if I don't fine. The whole point of this journal was supposed to be about my spiritual journeys anyway.   So onto the journey right? Well as it stands now, I consider myself pagan. Right now I'm kind of mix and matching two separate paths, Asatru, or norse paganism with american indian shamanism. It's been interesting, and I haven't learned nearly enough to feel comfortable in either.   That's not right, I feel comfortable in them, I just to feel proficient in them. I never much liked being a newbie at anything, and so here I am a very definite newbie. I find it kind of hard to study, Dan is very reluctant about me being pagan. As long as I'm not saying anything about it, it's all good. Sort of. He very much wants me to attend the LDS church with him. I don't mind going to support him, but that's not what he's looking for.   I don't want to be Christian. If find the religion stifling, yet I find myself reading more of and about the bible than I ever did while I was Christian. The more I read, the more convinced I am that it is not the religion for me. Dan doesn't seem to understand this. He sees me reading the bible and takes hope that I'll change my mind and come back to Christ. I can't do it though, having left, the thought of going back feels so wrong!   We've always followed the soft voice, the feeling in our gut, the compass in our head. It's always been an important part of our relationship, and yet he can't understand that the soft voice is SCREAMING at me about how  wrong  Christianity is, my gut twists itself into knots at the thought of returning, the compass in my head points strongly in another direction.   I have never been lead astray by these as a Christian, and I seriously doubt that somehow they'd suddenly betray me and lead me false now. Especially since my studies feel so much like coming  home .   Ken gave me a barnes and noble gift certificate for $25. I haven't spent it yet, but I so badly want to spend it on books to further my search. Problem is, Ken is a devout Catholic. Last thing I want is for him to try to convince me of the "error" of my ways too. Then again he might not, he already thinks I'm nuts.   Well I've never been one to choose the easy road. Everything in my life has been the path less taken, so why should this choice be any different?   Sometimes I just get tired of fighting for what feels right, and think it'd be so easy to let the current wash me away.

						   My Aunts came up from California and brought a truckload of stuff with them. Most of it was stuff that we needed. They brought us a loveseat and matching chair, an end table, loads and loads of sheets and clothes, baby stuff (more about that later), and a bed for Jaydn.   Jaydn really needed a bed, it was top on our list of things to get him, but the Aunts beat us to it. He likes it, and I like it, so I guess that's all that matters!  The presence of actual furniture in my living room brings home how small my living room actually is. There wouldn't be room for a full size couch, the loveseat and chair take up a lot of space. The only thing I might get is a matching coffee table, and end table. The end table they brought looks suspiciously like the night stand I had when I was a kid.   We went garage saleing yesterday, with a mission in mind. The Aunts wanted to buy us a dining table. We succeeded and got a very nice butcher block table. Actually we ended up with two tables. The first one was a very ugly formica topped rusted table. I needed a table so I wasn't going to let aesthetics get in the way. Then we found the butcher block table, and almost didn't get it. The lady selling it didn't want to come down on the price, and the Aunts didn't want to pay so much for it. As we were about to leave, the lady changed her mind, and a table, with matching chairs I now have.   It sounds like we're poor, needing living room furniture, dining room furniture, and even bedroom furniture for my son, but we're not. When we moved we left all of those items behind as they really needed to be retired. We expected to have them replaced by now, but my husband left his job, and once again we're living on what we can make. It's making the bills, but that's about it. No room for large expenses, like we had planned.   Anyhow, the visit with the Aunts was a lot of fun. It's been years since I've seen them, as my uncle was dying of Alzheimers, and didn't do well around children. They excited and scared him too much, which wasn't good for his health, so we didn't visit. Now that my uncle has passed away, Deb needs stuff to do, and my family has become her pet project.   I don't mind at all.

						   I missed yesturday. I really wanted to take the time to write, but everything that could come up did. Not that it was a bad day, it just wasn't what I had planned.   Today I don't really have the time to write. Well at least I shouldn't. My aunts are coming to visit from California. I'm really looking forward to having them here, but...I  hate  to clean.   My house isn't really all that bad, it's just something I'd rather not spend my time on. I've never really been all that tidy-ness inclined. I do well in chaos. I know where things are, and where to find them. It's just not all that aesthetically pleasing.   I don't know why blogger is turning off my commenting.. not that it matters, in such a new journal I wouldn't expect any anyway. It's just one of those scratch-your-head-and-go-huh?? things.  Eh, more updates in the wonderful world of me another time.. the pile of junk on my desk calls to be thrown away.

						   Granted, it's still the first day. Ok technically the second... but why was I ever worried that this place wouldn't get used?  So it's the middle of the night, and I can't sleep. Well no that's wrong. I hate my bed, and so I can't sleep comfortably. What's the point in trying to sleep if you just wake up more tired than when you went to bed??  I want a new bed, but how I'll achieve that I don't know. Right now I'm still trying to figure out rent for next month.   It would help, if Dan had a full time, regular income, 9-5 type of job, but that's just not us. We both like the benefits of both of us being home with the kids. If it weren't for money... Well.  Right now he's trying to make enough income for us to live off between programming and selling stuff on ebay. When he's not doing that, he's attempting to write a book. I can't wait to read it, it sounds like a good plot.   As for me going to work.. well I've been thinking about it alot lately. It's not that we're broke, we can afford the things we need to, which is nice, but well I'm a creature comfort girl. Our mattress is worn out, we need new tires for the car, and I'd like to stop worrying about money.   That's not true. I don't worry about money as much as I used to. It used to be something that was constantly, and always on my mind. Now it's just an annoyance whenever I go to bed, and dream and wish I had a more comfortable one.   It doesn't help that not long ago we were totally spoiled by a nice check from AMD for some contract work that Dan did. I can't help but look back at that money and think "I wish we would have.." The problem is, we needed everything (except some junk food) that we bought with that money. For as much as it was, it just didn't go quite so far as I would have liked.   And, well, as much as I would like more money around the house, the likelyhood of me returning to work while pregnant is less than nil. Even then until babe is weaned, I wont likely return to work. At that; what would I go to? I've been a "homemaker" for the last 6 years. That's not exactly prime stuff to list on a resume. Even then, my skills are woefully behind the times. Who wants to hire a net geek with 6 year old skills?   It's time to look into a different career anyway, the IT market is over saturated, and I'm not much into competing. I toyed with the idea of going into healthcare, but as you get to know me, you'll know that's not were I belong. I feel like I'm a little kid again, with some grown up asking me "what do you want to be when you grow up?".   I don't know any more now than I did then. The only things I do know is what I  don't  want to be.   I guess it's a start.

						   I was wandering around in my server and I noticed that my first post wasn't in the correct directory. So I'm wondering if it's just because I haven't added anything since I made a few changes.   In other words: Test

						   This is the second blog I've opened today. Hopefully I'll be fairly active at keeping them both updated. They both have completely different purposes.  urlLink Pathways  is for my spiritual journeys. My explorations and wonderings. Shiney, or whatever this journal eventually gets called, is for more mundane things; day to day life. Specifically so I can talk about my pregnancy. I've been wanting to talk about it, but now that I have a place, will I?  This is my 4th pregnancy, and isn't any more special than my other three, except for the virtue of being my last. It's a different thing, it seems to go through pregnancy knowing that you'll be having more, it's entirely different to know that there wont. It's almost akin to the wonders of the first pregnancy, when everything was new and unexpected.   It's been a little while since I've been pregnant. My 3 children were born in fairly rapid succession, with 14 months between #1 & #2, and almost 2 years exactly between #2 and #3. My youngest is now 3 and will be 2 months from her 4th birthday by the time this one is born.   We didn't intentionally wait so long. We began trying when she was still very young, less than a year. For some reason, nothing happened. We were beginning to think that one of us had "broken" after #3 was born. DH had suffered a seriously heinous kick to the groin, and I had had a uterine infection a few weeks after her birth.   I had just come to terms with the fact that I may never have the 4th child I wanted so much when I concieved. It was truley a blessing and a gift.   Well I guess I wont have any problem writing here afterall. It's time for me to feed my children dinner, so I will have to continue with my posts another time.

						   I can't count how many times I would click on the link to here, and just close the window once I got here. It's painful in a way to return to blogging. It means I must take time out of my life, lift my head above the water, and breathe. Time for myself is something I've never managed well. I'm an all or nothing person. Admittedly a weak spot.   I miss it though, the daily core dump of thoughts. The random flight of my fingers in the river of words to a faceless face. It's not that my life is all that interesting. I'm a mom, I spend my days with my children taking care of thier needs. I'm anxious about sending my oldest to school. I think she needs it, my husband would rather continue homeschooling her.    I  would rather homeschool her, but I feel like a failure of a teacher. I don't feel like I have the patience required to teach her the basics; reading, writing, math. She needs better than me, and yet, my husband thinks she's fine. I may try homeschooling again when she has these basics. We'll try over a summer break and see where we go.   I can't help but think though, if my children go to school, then that will give me the daytime to go to school myself, or get a job or do  something  outside of the house.   I'm feeling overwhelmed. I have 3 kids who I love with all my heart, and can barely keep up with, and I'm pregnant with my 4th. How am I going to handle them all?! I feel like I'm totally short changing Shirley because I'm so involved not only with the pregnancy but Rowan and Jaydn. I'm hoping that maybe by enrolling her in school that she'll get the education her brain is soo thirsty for, and friends, which she doesn't really have here. She'll also get a break from everyone, which I think would do her good, she needs a life outside the family like the rest of us do.   It's getting late, and I need to go.
