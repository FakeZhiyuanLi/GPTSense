      Move all your contacts from Yahoo! Mail, Outlook, and others to Gmail in just a few clicks. Then simply rely on our auto-complete feature to prefill all your addresses for you. liefe is becoming easy as that... Gmail now supports MAC OX`s 'Safari 1.2.1' plus you can now add your signature... But the most favourite feature that i love in gmail is "Shortcut keys and instant reply forward feature" come to think of it they are much faster than the desktop email applications... gmail is yet to rock!!!!

       urlLink PHP 5.0.0  is now available, there are some cool and useful features added on to the new release like:    New and improved XML support   New built-in SOAP extension for interoperability with Web Services   Streams have been greatly improved   Improved error checking and lots more...    i`ll update more on this as soon as i get my hands on it.    Knoppix 3.3 -   Was checking out the knoppix OS, actually its another version of Linux (if i`m not mistaken), the best advantage of this OS is you don`t have to install anything onto your system, it`s a matter of booting (running) the OS CD and 'voila'  I have Linux in my machine...I was fiddling around with it, seems like a sweet tool to learn some fundamentals 'like how to use the vim Editor'...

      Just exactly what is OOP? recently this question was asked by a flash enthusiast, and this was the reply to his question...  "Take a real life example, its not that hard to understand the concept !  if you want to describe objects, you can consider yourself as an object under the class of humans...if i am to explain it in detail i`d have to take a short leave from office  let me give a very brief description, based on the class 'Human'   CLASSES  All people you and me can come under the class of humans. example -> HUMAN   OBJECTS  an instance (or a copy) of the human 'class'.. example -> YOU   PROPERTIES  The attributes you have in order to define (express) yourself... example -> your name, your hair color, your skin color, your height...   METHODS  what you can do (in other words 'actions') example -> eat, sleep, speak...  This is the shortest way I can describe objects and classes..."  and I think anyone can take this in a gulp.

      I would have posted this last night itself but i do not have a modem to go live, its been a long day, i`m still tryig to recover from my weekend back at my olds. as i await for the exams to near i havent touched the book, I`m spending all my time on the project, the development phase is almost completed, it`s a matter of tweaking here and there, once i do that i have to do the documentatio... I`m getting the usual 'regret' feeling where i think "I could have completed this if i had started early". It`s Typical me alright...  Sri Lanka 2 out of 2 Yup! the lions are in the lead taking 2 consecutive wins, Sundays one was quite a game, `cos indians against the sri lankas are a game to see, That reminds me...a friend of mine who used to adore india, I used to tease her all the time, she was totally attached to the indian team (and India), not that i have a grudge against the indians or anything like that but... i`d like to make an exception when it comes to my li`l indian friend (trust me she`s li`l :p). anyways lets see who picks up the money bag in the asia cup... signing out.

      somethings wrong with our gateway, the whole network is jerking... in between this i made use of the time by doing a good deed, ohhh yeah !!! had to teach PHP to a collegue of mine, and i`m really happy he asked, i`m training myself to present in the forthcoming macromedia usergroup meeting, one thing I mostly have is stage freights, and i want to get over that as soon as possible...   I finished my assignments...Yipee!!  Finally I get to finish my semester assignments, now i have to start on with the project work, hopefully i can finish the development by the end of this week, then i have two weeks spare to complete my documentation... I hope i can ace everything by then, it`s really been a busy day!

      it`s been a long day, i have almost completed my assigments, now the next step is to print them a bind them before handing it over tomorrow (or maybe the day after).. I am a bit satisfied that i`m giving the assignment on time, now i have to start completing my semester project which is supposed to be a stupid job bank website containing all ASP scary tags that call upon 'access' data values, to make things worse i have to write a case study, a user manual and also give a presentation on the project.   The weird part of me (I think yours too!)  sometimes i get drifted away thinking of some not very imoprtant topics like "why did i enroll for this degree program?" which ultimately branches onto something else like "how many stars are in the sky?", "which branches to "are aliens a science fiction crap or are they for real", and that leads to something more spookier, then suddenly "BANG" i switch back to normal mode, where i ask myself what was i doing for the past 10 - 30 minutes. spoooky! Don`t you get that feeling?

      Seems like only 40% of the sri lankan`s had paid intrest voting in the provincial council election this time! isn`t it funny, how almost all the srilankans think alike. i hardly pay attention nor show intrest in politics, but this is something to worry about...

      Finally! I went to see perahara after a long while, had to wait for about 4-5 hours till the parade started and the another two hours till it ended, I would have just passed along the day, but after 20 years my cousin visited us and i didn`t want her to miss it, so i tagged her along to the perahara with her friend...who visited as well.  urlLink     hic`cups
