      With just over five days to go before I split for  urlLink Ronneby , I'm having a modern dilemma - what media to take! Ten days without some familiar sounds and visions will really do my head in, so I've been busy ripping and compressing CDs and DVDs ready for bundling onto the work laptop and the PDA.  As I'm also taking my camera I'll need to get a power converter for the battery charger, as well as some more Compact Flash cards.  Cripes knows what the custom guys will say when I go through the airport security scans with all that electrical gear stashed in the rucksack...

      Have you noticed how many more really fat people there are waddling about these days?  Now, before I get lynched by tubby lard arses calling me an insensitive pig who's pandering to the advertising industry myth of slinky people with perfect nostrils laughing beautifully as they have multiple orgasms in their designer jet fighters, let me differentiate.  I'm not talking about people such as yours truly who have some extra poundage that could be lost if we weren't keyboard-bound geeks who didn't exercise, or your cuddly work mate who has a weakness for lasagne, or your family member with the chemical imbalance.  No.  I'm talking about those lumpy, congealed behemoths that somehow manage to hyperventilate themselves out of their groaning Nissan Micras before thudding off towards the frozen foods section with their shuddering buttocks scraping and squeaking past one another like battling mice trapped inside a sweaty pair of knickers.  An example.  Me and Gerard went for a walk around  urlLink Dunham Massey Park and Gardens  today. It's nice place. The squirrels are tame, and so are the staff. But the glory of the flowers and the trees and merry little woodland creatures was soured a little bit every five minutes or so as we were brought face to face with another visitor from Planet Michelin. We saw so many blubbery chins and felt the earth shake so many times that we thought we'd arrived at Fat Bastards' Convention 2004.  Now, I could present theories on why these people are as they are, such as abused as a child, insecure personality, social exclusion leading to inappropriate diet and similar, and I could quote from The Gospel According To Saint Oprah by referring to them as Persons of Weight Challengement, Victims of Image Expectation, Body Prisoners or some other evasive moniker. But, I won't.  They're fat people who eat too much.  And there's more of them.  And they're everywhere.  And you're next.  Just thought I'd get that off my chest.  Have a nice day.

      On June 1, I'll be off to Sweden to attend the  urlLink TeleCities Summer Event 2004  in  urlLink Ronneby .  It's a  urlLink work  trip, but I'm really looking forward to it as it's my first ever trip abroad, and it'll only be the third time I've flown.  In these days of cheap flights and cheaper accommodation, it might sound a bit odd for a 36 year old, fairly well off chap like me to tramping off on his virgin voyage to the land of Johnny Foreigner, but I've had my reasons. (Such as looking after my insane old mother, having a succession of crap jobs that didn't pay enough, and other wrist-slittingly depressing reasons I won't bore you with here.)  I've been trying to find information about the places to stay and where to play over in Ronneby, but can't find much on the web. I've no intention of just hanging about the hotel if there's an intersting rock formation or two nearby, and as my boss Phil will also have itchy feet I'll have someone to go 'ooh' and 'aah' will at all the new stuff they'll be to see.  Of course, my camera will be coming along, so expect lots of pictures of hairy beasts and pretty flowers on this here blog in the latter part of June. (As long as I remember to get a UK to European mains power converter, that is.)

      I've gone and done it again. This time, I'm on Blogger.  Why the move? Well...  TypePad was costing me about £6 a month and Blogger is free.  Blogger's templates are nicer and (after a quick look under the hood) I think I may be able to hack a template of my own.  Not earth shattering reasons, but there we are.

      That's right. After years on the web I've finally got  urlLink my own domain .  What's more, it's hosted by those cool and froody  urlLink TextDrive  guys.  And I'll be using  urlLink Textpattern  as my CMS.  And, thanks to  urlLink work , I've got a  urlLink Vodafone 3G card  to stick in my Tablet PC for "testing" purposes next week whilst over in  urlLink Amsterdam . (Cue huge bandwith bill and a fight with the boss.)  Life is suddenly looking like it knows where it's towel is.

       urlLink This book  got it's claws into me as I was doing my usual "wander round Waterstone's checking out the books I'm going to buy cheapear at Amazon" routine yesterday.  It's so good that I bought it there and then. My favourite photo from the book is  urlLink reproduced online .  The book's only a tenner, so what are you waiting for?

      Sweden and Denmark are so two weeks ago, so now I'm off to join the Adaptive Path gang in  urlLink Holland .  Also, this blog's days are numbered. I'm waiting for the button's to be pressed over at  urlLink TextDrive , then manhog.net will no longer be a dream once had by a crazy kid from the sticks...

      Well, here I am in Sweden. Ronneby is very nice, very clean and appears to be very crime free. (What the Ronneby bad boys seem to do for kicks is drive around in open top American cars playing alt.country, sort of loud.) Unfortunately, it's also very small. It kind of reminds me of Lytham, only with more trees.  The flight out was nice (after being frisked by security as my steel toe caps set the metal detectors off). The sights of the flight were clouded out (with the occasional contrails and sun devils), until we got close to the Danish coast, when the clouds parted to reveal a very, very long, very, very nice beach.  Memories of the Danish landscape included a field looking like a shattered glass window, flat, lots of farms fields, which all seemed to have a square area set aside in them (maybe it’s a law), quarries, islands, lakes and seas, boats and windmills.  Coming into land at Copenhagen Airport was quite fun, as the plane kept banking to lose altitude, which meant flying low over the sea (or was it a lake?), and I thought I kept seeing whales surfacing, but it was only waves.  After the three hour train trip, we arrived at the Ronneby Brunn Spa hotel - very nice, but reminds me of The Overlook Hotel from The Shining, lots of red carpets and long hallways.  Went for a walk on Tuesday afternoon to scope the place out, and ended up on a hill overlooking the hotel.   urlLink     urlLink     Anyway, the conference I'm here to attend is in full swing at the moment, so I've got to wrap this up before the afternoon workshops sessions start, which are all about tedious but necessary things such as interoperability and e-enabling your cat.  I've only managed to post this blog as the conference centre has broadband and free network connections lying around. No Internet in the Hotel, though there is porn per view. (90 Swedish krona a day. Cheap! Ya ya!)  More to come, if I can get another connection...
