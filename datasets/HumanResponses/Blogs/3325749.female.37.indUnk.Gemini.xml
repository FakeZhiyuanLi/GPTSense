      Well it's two days since I last spoke to G.  I miss him like crazy and can't stop thinking about him but I know I have to be strong this time.  So I'm filling my life with other men in my life. I didn't end up going out for drinks with W last nite.  He didn't call me till 9:30 and I just said..ah screw it.  He called again tonight and I didn't answer the phone. hee hee playing a man's game now :p  Today was an uneventful day.  Work was boring as hell.  I was busy helping the girls but damn I have such a boring job.  I need to learn my graphics so I can change to something else.  After work I went tanning (upped my time by a whole two minutes..lmao)  Looking pretty good if I don't say so myself.  Just need to get rid of this fat on my body.  After that I went to my favorite bookstore...walked around for a couple of hours bought a few magazines then headed back home.  Signed online and guess who was there. Nope not G  it was Kevin (in Iraq still)  You know that is one man that I will never understand but know that I will always love for some reason.  We go so far back it's not funny but I know he has a jealousy and anger problem so why do I get caught up in this trap.  Once again he was telling me how much he loves me and misses me.  blah blah blah. Told me about a race he's in at the ned of July and wants to fly me down to see him.  Said no strings attached wanted to make up for everything that had happened.  Hmmm ya ok.  Other then that it was a very borinnnnnnnnnnnnnnng day/nite.  I'm hiding online from all my internet buddies.  I just don't feel like talking to anyone right now.  My head hurts thats how confused I am.  I need some major changes in my life soon or I'm going to go stir crazy.  Why can't I win the damn lottery and pay off my bills and split this joint.  I'd leave and never turn back!!!  Oh well wishful thinking on my part.  Well I'm going to head to bed early tonight.  Will write again tomorrow...woohoo all my exciting stories. lmao NOT  ~~peace~~  Kat

      Well last nite..once again it happened.  No not sex. :p  I had this feeling that the reason G had that conversation with me yesterday was because he wanted to clear his concious about going on a date and guess what?  I was f*&^^ing right!!  I knew it.  I called him on his home phone didn't answer, called him on his cell phone didn't answer..I knew it was on because it rang twice and then went to voice mail. Hmmm fine.  I said enough is enough this is the nail in the coffin.  It's over.  (and all this before I even knew if I was right or not!)   I called back his homeline and just told him I was tired of the games he's playing with me emotionally and that it's over for good don't call back.  It was about a 15 minute message.  Poured my heart out.  I love this man but the way he is treating me I really don't deserve this.  Yes it's my fault for letting it happen all the time but this time I mean it. It's over and if I everrrrrrrrrrrr get back with him even for sex someone better shoot me. Anyways about 20 minutes after I left the message I get a call from him from his cell phone.  He wanted to come over.  I said no.  He said why not.  I said because your not going to go on a date and then come over and f*&&ck me you a**hole.  He said yes he did go out on a double date with Wally and the two sisters but that he still wanted to see me and the date was harmless.  I said well good luck with your new found love because this was the nail in the coffin.  I hung up.  He called back again...I picked up and said G I'm only going to say this once.  Please do not call me back.  He said fine if that's what you want...I said yes it is what I want.  He said fine K...I'll leave you alone.  All the best to you.  I hung up.  When I woke up this morning this is what i had waiting for me in my mailbox....  Hi I got your phone message just now, i will never erase it , was the sweetest thing i have ever heard, im sorry for the way i have behaved, and u are a very special woman to me , and i will always have a place in my heart for you as well. I hope you can forgive me one of these days,and i really hope the  next guy u meet has his head and shit together alot better than i did :), love always greg...  Urghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....I read it put it in his lil email folder and then went to work.    Last nite I also did something else I forgot to mention.  I called Warren.  He was happy to hear from me and said do you know what today is?  I said no..what is today.  He said it was a year ago that we had our first date.  lmao  How ironic.  He thought that is why I was calling.  I said how do you know that today is the anniversary of our first date.  He said because it's the same date every year for the basketball NBA draft.  I laughed my ass off.  Now that's funny.  He must have sensed I was a lil down because he offered to come over to tell me a bedtime story.  I laughed.  I'm not like G I'm not going to just hop back into the sack with someone.  I said how about drinks tomorrow nite. He said he was busy till 9 but he would love to hook up after that.  He had some work function. I said sure..why not.  It's now 6 and I don't want to go.  I may just not answer his call! I can play these male games for crying out loud.  After I got off the phone with him I turned off the lites and tv and tried to sleep. Couldn't...so I picked up the phone and called an internet buddy "Reggie" from Michigan.  He was staying at a hotel for work because he was on training.  This man is so sweet.  But then aren't they all.  We talked for about an hour, I finally had to say goodnite because I was tired.  Went to sleep...zzzz  lol  Decided today to take my profiles down off the net.  I'm tired of this online dating crap.  I have enough men on my messenger to get a date if I want one. lol  I just think I need some time alone to heal after the whole G incident.  Why am I searching so hard???  I know I don't need a man in my life to be content or happy.   Oh well...  Going to make my bachorlette dinner...Mac and cheese. :-)  Will write again if anything happens...don't hold your breathe anyone!  Kat

      Well I'm ready to throw my hands up in the air once again and say f&%$# it all.  guess you must be saying..now what happened.  Well let me push the rewind button....Last nite...date with Mr Principal.  We were originally suppose to go for coffee and then he had got off work early so he asked if I wanted to go for dinner so I said sure...why not.  I met him at the restaurant...quiet spot in the place...was a nice setting.  I ordered a cosmopolitan..mmmm good  lol  Then he arrived.  I don't know what I expected but he was alright...Pudgy tummy.  Reminded me a bit of Peter.  But once we started talking...I knew right away this was the first and last date with him.  He just kept talking about himself, his travels, hardly looked at me in the eye.  At this point...I was thinking about what I could be doing if I were not sitting there with him.  He went on and on about his "female" friends  blah blah blah...whenever I would open my mouth he would switch the conversation back to him...Also found out he lives with his mother....oh god..what is up with men moving back home.  After 2 hrs of this torture (good meal though) we left the place.  We stood uncomfortable and had small talk outside and then I thanked him for dinner and say g'nite...he asked if I wanted a ride home but I lied and said I had some shopping to do lmao... Oh well  bye bye Mr. Principal.  G called me when I was in the mall and asked what I was doing.  Played his own game by telling him I was shopping with Nellie...he said for me to call him when I got back home which I did...the  first thing out of his mouth was that he was craving me and wanted to know if he could come over by cab.  Hey why not...lol  He came over...we screwed like rabbits and then went to sleep.  He left this morning.  Day started well...until he decides to call me and got into a conversation about what we're doing.  I personally think that he had set up a date himself and that he didn't want his guilty concious bothering him.  I told him that I luv him but I am not going to beg for him to be in a relationship he doesn't want to be in.  We agreed we would try again to stop contacting eachother in order to move on.  he called back three times but I didn't want to talk anymore.  F$#%^^ this sh*&  I'm so tired of this crap with regards to men.  I need to get back into myself and stop the mission to try and find a man.  One will come along when I least expect it ((i hope))  I hate being alone.  But I'm also not going to settle for just anyone.  Must pick self help books!!!  lmao    going to chill...will write tomorrow...  peace  Kat

      Well it's Monday night already and the long weekend is over. :-( Yuck that means back to work tomorrow.  Spent my whole weekend chatting online, going tanning, pigging out...and oh ya having sex with G.  Yes I know I know...I'm crazy where he's concerned.  Even found out today that he had a double date tonight...but he's decided he would feel guilty and chose not to go.   He's on his way over here for our "last nite" together once again.  How many last nites can two people have?  Something strange happened today as well.  I joined a dating site that I said I would never have anything to do with.  Low and behold..I got flooded with smiles and notes.  One in particular caught my eye...and he's even in Toronto.  He's 39, he's a school principle.  We chatted, talked live and booked a date for tomorrow nite...can you believe this???  I am surprising myself.  I'm not going to tell G.  Why should I.  I don't know how many bbw's he's dating or chatting with so why shouldn't I go out.  Now this guy might be out of my league since i don't even have a high school degree.  I'm hoping he won't notice :-)  I'm actually very excited right now...as well as a lil nervous.  Oh well perhaps I'll have something exciting to tell ya tomorrow.  Either that or it will be a disaster and I'll be crying on this keyboard.    peace...  Kat

      I can't believe I haven't written in here for three days. Oops...it's not like I have a life and don't have time that's for sure.  Let's see if I can remember the last three days...Wednesday went to work, came home and talked on the phone for a bit with an online friend.  Thursday went to work, went to tanning salon.  G called and left me a message on my work line saying that there was an accident near my work and that there were not buses...Just wanted to let me know. Hmmm how sweet. I was going the other way anyways.  lol  BUT I did think about him alot for the rest of the evening.  Didn't call and was so proud of myself.  BUT I screwed up yesterday.  I added him back to my yahoo messenger and he was online.  He said hi and that was it.  Next thing you know he's coming over here.  I couldn't help it.  It's been a week without Sex. lol  He slept over.  Urghh...he told me he deleted all of his personal ads online.  Ya right I've heard that before.  Didn't want to even discuss online issues since I've been talking to so man men lately my head is spinning.  But it was nice to have him beside me again.  Sex was amazing of course. Very intense.  He went home this morning and I chatted online for awhile then he called me to say he was going in my direction if I needed a lift to the subway.  I was on my way to tanning so I said sure why not.  He came up and bang we ended back in bed.  Damnnnnnnnnnnnn  I showered again and got all dolled up (just to make him jealous)  He said you look great..are you going to meet someone. I said no..just the new "single" me needs to start taking better care of myself. *smirk*  Think I have him thinking now since the phone also rang when we were leaving I looked at the number and didn't answer telling G it's a friend I'll call him from the road.  Oops silence.  lol  I have to try my hardest not to let emotions get in the way of our sex romps.  I know he doesn't want me because he supposibly looking for something else and so am I.  But in the meantime why not have a lil fun and physical enjoyment.  Better then ending up in some strangers bed. Right...trying to convince myself I'll be just fine. Keep saying it...i'll be fine..i'll be fine...lmao  Came home from tanning and actually picked up some groceries.  Wow..a lil food in the fridge.  And don't faint anyone. I cooked. lol  I need a good meal in me.    Oh well I'm going to go eat it now.  I just came over to the computer while the rice was simmering.  Another Saturday nite all alone...*sigh*    Kat

      Well the last time I wrote I had G in my bed and I was feeling confused but ok.  Two days later...there is no more G in my life once again and I'm ok with it this time.  I feel different.  Not sad, not lonely, not craving him.  I'm actually happier then ever.  Yesterday I went to work all happy, everyone loved the new hair cut.  Then I went tanning.  Always feel great after that.  Had a bite to eat, went to the bookstore and got home around 8 p.m.  Went online and the notes just kept flying.  lol  Men men everywhere...wanting to chat with me, talk to me live, talking all kinds of crap about flying up to see me.  I wish I was more daring then I already am.  But I'm not the type of woman to just meet someone one day and screw them the next therefore it's hard for me to deal with it.  I now have eight new friends added to my list.  Damn this is so confusing keeping them all apart.  But it's fun.  They lift my spirit.  I ended up on the phone till the wee hours of the morning with a cop from Maryland.  He had me in stitches.  My belly was aching from laughing so much. lol    Then today I woke up late...again!!!  Jumped in the shower and even though I was having a very bad hair day since it was my first time trying to style this doo.  I was still happy when I looked in the mirror.  Damn tan is looking good :-)  I was going to go back to the salon today but I think I'll spread out the days I go instead.  Can be pretty costly if I went more then three times a week.  Had a great day at work.  Chatted online most of the day.  My job has gotten so boring it's not funny.  I'm bored bored bored.  I need to smarten up and get that graphic design certificate soon so I can do my own thing. Urghhh  It's all about money though.  Where am I going to find 500 every couple of months.  Oh well like they say if there is a will there's a way..right :-)  Came straight home after work.  Rec'd a really nice email from a guy that sent me a smile yesterday.  He's 43 though.  Over my limit of age but hey he seems very genuine so I wrote him back.  What do I have to lose?  Not giving my heart to anyone anytime soon that's for sure.  Needs time to heal after G stomped on it several times.  So I'm going to go chill out.  Take a shower, watch a movie, chat a bit and go to bed and start the day again on hopefully a happy note once again.  Thank goodness only two more days of this week since I'm taking Friday off as a vacation day and Monday is a holiday...Woohoo!!  Will write back if something amazing happens in the next couple of hours otherwise I will write tomorrow. :-)  ~~peace~~  Kat

      Will I ever learn?  I don't think so.  Today I woke up all bright eyed and optimistic about the day.  Took my shower, got dressed (put on a cutesy top) Hair actually looks good today.  Going to take some time to get used to though.  Then ring ring..phone rings. It was G.  He went to see an apt and liked it.  Asked if he could drop by since he was in the area.  I said sure like the idiot that I am.  Why can't I say no and mean it?? especially where he is concerned.  Have I not been hurt enough by him? I guess I'm just a sucker for punishment.  Anyways he came up...seemed impressed that I was all dolled up and he liked my new hair do.  Kept giving me compliments.  I think he had thought I was going to meet someone and thats why he said why don't we go see a movie.  And we did...went to see Troy.  It was three hours but I really enjoyed it.  After the movie he came back here for a bit.  Thank god..it's that time of month or I know exactly where whe would have ended up.  Damn it.  Why do we have such a physical attraction for eachother.  What we had or have is so much more then sex but I don't think I have ever felt this type of chemistry.  He just looks at me and I want him in my bed.  He's just as bad.  He calls me a bad kitten..lmao  Oh well..he went home for awhile but couldn't get any work done or concentrate because his mom was doing some renovations on the house so he asked if he can come back over here.  He's still here now but in bed sleeping.  Said he had a headache and just wanted to lay down but that he was leaving around 10.  Nice drop in center I run here..lmao  Oh well...I only have myself to blame if this ends up hurting me again.  There is a slight difference though with today.  I put a personal ad up on a dating site to see if I could meet people in my area as opposed to the american men that I have been in contact with.  It's working.  Today already I had ten emails from all the type of men that I would be attracted to and they actually live around my place.  Amazing. So I am not giving up hope that I'll be able to one day say G who because I have found that special someone that I'm actually looking for that knows what he wants out of life, doesn't have to go searching for someone else and that will love me for who I am. *sigh*  Well going to go watch some tv till G gets up.  I'll be back if there's anything else to tell but probably not.    ~~peace~~  Kat

      Oops...I didn't write last nite.  Hmmm perhaps it was because I was to drunk to.  lol  Nell, Fatima and I went for drinks after work.  Had a great time but drank way to much.  G called me last nite at 12:30 but I didn't answer the phone.  Unfortunately because I didn't answer he's under the impression that I had someone over to my house.  whatever...had another good bye conversation.  how many good byes can  we have???  This one has to be for good  this time.  He doesn't trust me.  I will never be able to trust him after all the lies.  So today I gave my head a shake and I'm now determined to get over this down phase.  I am a stronger woman then this.  So I went tanning, chopped my hair off, got some blonde highlights and came home.  Went online to the dating site I joined in order to meet new people.  Had several messages.  Appears there are some really nice guys  out there.  But why can't I find one in my area instead of thousands of miles away?  I started chatting with this guy from Michigan tonight...after chatting online for a couple of hours, he asked if we could speak live...Since my hand was about to fall off I said sure and gave him my number.  Two and a half hours into the conversation he decides to tell me his situation.  He's living with a woman that he says he doesn't love and that he is trying to get his shit together to leave her.  He has a 13 yr old son.  Just great!!!  Are all men fu*&&ed up or what?  How will I ever know when to believe a man again?  Throwing my hands in the air...I give up on them.    Well my fingers are tired, my eyes are tired.  I think I'll try and watch a movie till I fall asleep.    --peace--  Kat

      Pulling my hair out.  How can I be soooo stupid.  I had a week moment and called G just to see how he was doing.  Or was it to check up on him.  I don't know but he acted all cool like not talking to me in three days didn't hurt.  He's been keeping himself busy or so he says with his friends.  Most likely he was on dates with his bbw women from his date website I caught him on.  Oh ya not to mention now he's a Lavalife addict.  So tell me if I'm so hostile towards this man why after I told myself a thousand times that I wouldn't let him back over here did I let him.  After our lil conversation I said well take care and good luck with your business.  He said ya you take care to.  Then five minutes later he calls me back and said can I come over for a lil while just to be with you.  Not for sex or anything just to hang out for awhile.  My head said no...but my heart (and hormones) said of course I want to see him again.  It had only been three days since we decided to end this so called relationship. (for the umpteenth time)  He came over, called me from the road and asked if I wanted any food. I declined.  It was 10 p.m. already.  He came over, looked rough, head wasn't shaved, either was his face.  He came into my room and we watched tv.  Every once in awhile I caught him looking at me. We talked about nothing important and then I f**&king leaned over and kissed him.  Why why why does he have this sexual power over me.  Sex is awesome with him that's why.  It's the best either of us has ever had.  But his whole thing of going our separate ways is because he wants to still meet people and not settle down just yet.  He thinks I just want to get married again and have a kid right away.  Well helloooooo I'm still legally married, and as far as kids are concerned I've told him a million times that I have gynecologist problems with regards to that aspect and I'd have to go through a fertility specialist to have a kid.  Doctors have told me that for years.  But his paranoid that somehow with his luck it would happen with him.  He already has Bree who's 3 and doesn't want anymore right now in his life which is fine with me.  I have always said if it happens it happens...but I'm not going to kill myself if I never have a child.  Anyways he ended up staying till 3 in the morning.  We once again said our "final" farewell, good luck, have a nice life at the door.  But low and behold doesn't the guy call me at work three times to complain about his mother.  He apologized for calling but said I've always understood him and he had no one else to talk to.  Urghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Are we back at square one again? Please tell me no..Tell me I can be a stronger women.  We are not going anywhere in this relationship.  It's this sexual chemistry I think that keeps us going around in circles.  I'm so fed up with the way my heart is pulling one way and my mind knows that I need to get rid of this man before he brings me down into a depressed state of mind and breaks my heart till I will never be able to heal again.    Well it's 8 p.m. and I'm exhausted. Hmmmm could it be I only had three hours of sleep? lol  Well I have no answers once again.  Confused, my heart hurts, my head hurts from thinking to much.  I'm going to lay down and perhaps what a dvd to take my mind off things.   till I write again....  ~~peace~~  Kat

      Well you think I would have learned my lesson by now at the age of 36 3/4 (birthday is around the corner) and after the numerous relationships I've been in.  But noooooo.....I just keep getting slapped in the face by these f*#@&ed up men.  Why do I keep hooking up with the wrong men?  I think I'm being punished for leaving my husband 2 1/2 years ago to be honest with you.  Is a crime to admit you've made a mistake and not live a lie for the rest of your life?  Lots of questions but never any answers.  Maybe I need a shrink, maybe I need a better support group of so called friends that are never there for me when I need them.  But the first person they call is me when sh*%$t hits the fan in their life.  So what now...I don't know.  Right now I'm pissed off, I want to sit at a bar and drink myself till my heart doesn't hurt.  I want to run away.   I want to say f*%#&ck this city and start over.  I don't have anything or anyone holding me back from doing just that.  Oh one minor detail...My big flippn' debt that I have.  Well I guess if I'm taking a one way trip I can always just declare bankruptcy. Urghhh what a thought.  It took me so long to get my credit back just to think about having to rebuild it scares me.   I don't know what I'm going on about.  I know I should be thankful I have my health, a roof over my head, food in my fridge (when I buy it) etc.  But I'm not HAPPY...I'm miserable, I'm just existing.  I wanted so badly to find happiness, not alone but to share my life with someone.  I know I have alot to offer a relationship and to the right man.    Since I left my ex I've had three ex's since then.  What the hell does that say. The first one doesn't count.  He was just a rebound out of my marriage. You know younger man..Need I say more, the second one turned into a psychotic crazy man on me, and the third was a screwed up, lying, cheating man.  Which he still doesn't think he did anything wrong and wants to be friends.  What the f*&^ck is wrong with me choosing these men?  Am I that desperate?  My self esteem isn't that low that I need a man in my life to be happy, but I truly believe I'm a better person when I'm madly in love.  I would do anything for the person that I love.  The last one used this to his advantage many times over.  I don't ask for much out of a relationship.  All I'm asking for is someone who is kind hearted, considerate, passionate, romantic, affectionate, loving, respectful, doesn't lie, doesn't cheat, is willing to give 100% into a relationship.  Needs to know how to communicate and be open minded especially in bed.  Damn is that to much to ask for?  I'm sure I left a few things out.  Oh ya like not wanting to kill me with second hand smoke.  lmao  God I'm glad I still have a sense of humor even after all the pain I'm feeling inside right now.    So...back to my original question...how do I pick up the pieces and my shredded heart and start over again?  I'll part with that thought in my head and hopefully I'll be back soon to let you know if I came up with an answer.

      I'm terrible at keeping this updated..lol  Oh well it's my blog and i'll type if I want to. :-)  Let's see..what's been happening..  No surprise...G2 is still around.  BUT..you'll be happy to know I bought a book today that will hopefully help me say a final good bye.  The book is called How to fall out of love.  Don't laugh.  I also bought another one called The Between Boyfriends book.  Lots of reading.  I'm going to start 2nite since nothing is going on.  Update on men...  G2 - It's been an emotional rollercoaster all week.  He avtually had a date lined up with someone today.  But his mother got sick and had to go to the hospital.  I told him a lie.  Yup me lying can you believe that?  Not like me but I did it.  I told him that Steve was here from Montreal and that I went to brunch with him this morning.  I know he was so jealous.  I could tell.  When he called me I was at the bookstore buying the books.  He said can I pick you up.  I said no..but then I caved when he asked if we can go to lunch.  His treat.  I figured what the heck.  Instead we ended up going to the movies.  he was all cuddly and everything.  What the fuck is wrong with us???  I know he loves me.  He dropped me off and then went to pick up his mom and that's when she ended up getting sick and in hospital.  I asked if he cancelled his date and he said he couldn't call her because the number was at home..haha bitch.  i'm bad  anyways next man  lol  Johnathan - same old shit but he hardly talks to me anymore.  No great loss since I think he's a playa anyways.  He's got  baby mama drama anyways.  He could have come to visit me but instead he went to Florida for four days to watch a baseball tournament so he says.  I think it was to see a woman personally.  Like i said..oh well no great loss there.  George - the guy that stood me up last week text me twice during the week asking if I wanted to go for a drink.  asshole.  didn't reply.  new guys :)  Kini - Niceeeeeee...he's in Florida. Lives alone, drives a lexus.  he's gorgeous.  what's the catch..yup  has a kid.  he's originally from NY bronx.  I like him though.  and guess what?  we had phone sex last nite.  I only did it because i was pissed off at G2 but i have to admit it was fun :)  I've been on my period all week so i am horny as hell right now!!  then there's  Karlton - cute young kid from Philly.  He's a cutey but a bit to young for me.  But we can have fun online.  Kyle - Chicago.  He's a nice guy.  Creative..compute geek.  We talk on the phone everyday  Notice no toronto men..sigh  Steve - he's turned into a jerk.  If only G knew.  lol  He is turning out to be a playa type.  I'm not playing the chase me game  I think that's it.  Need some fresh toronto guys though.  I want to start going out.  sigh.  Look at me home on yet another Saturday nite.  pathetic.  Well I'm going to eat my pizza and read my book.   peace  Kat

      Just got home from a night out in Burlington.  Finally made it out to Carole's new place.  Wasn't anything special.  I think she could have done better.  She kept calling it the ghetto.  It just may be. lol  She's fixing up the house there's nothing wrong with that.  But you can hear your neighbors walking.  Now how sad is that.  Oh well. I'm happy for her that she has her own house.  Look at me renting this damn condo for 1150 a month.  hmmm.  Oh well I didn't sleep very good though. Kept waking up. Strange place I guess.    G2 called me all pissed off today because he only got to see his daughter for 2 hours.  His ex is playing the old games again.  Men will never learn.  I guess you must be saying why is he back in the picture.  I don't have any answers.  Till the next fight I guess we'll just use eachother for sex. Like we did on Friday and Thursday.  He even came over yesterday morning to drive me to the train station and we had a quickie.  Sigh.  What can I say. The sex just keeps getting better.  How do I let that part go?  So until someone else comes along I'll just take the sex with G and forget about any future with the guy.    Here's some updates with the so called men in my life  Wayne - out of the picture all together Reggie - out of the picture all together Frank - haven't heard from him in a couple of days.  who cares. he's strange Johnathan - text him this morning to say happy fathers day and he called me..talked for a few minutes.  nothing exciting Steve - Talked to him on Friday for a while. Had a good conversation.  Still not sure about him.  Will have to wait and see when I meet him in July if he actually does come down here.  I did find out he is talking with some other chick from the internet that is madly in love with him.    I think that's it.  List needs to be thrown away I'm so sick of all of them.  Need to make adjustments to attitude and life.  Would someone please light a match under my azz!!  Oh well I'm tired out.  Going to lay down.  It's not even 3 in the afternoon and I'm exhausted from all the travelling today.     Will write later if anything exciting happens but don't hold your breathe :p  ~~peace~~  Kat

      June 12, 2004  Haven’t written for a few days because I haven’t been around.  Hmmm lets see what happened…Yesterday was my birthday by the way.  Yup 37…yikes.  Older but defenitely not wiser.  I fucked up again   On Thursday I rec’d an email from G2 and it made my heart stop so I picked up the phone to call him.  Yes he came over.  Yes we f*^@*ED like rabbits.  He slept over.  Then spent the morning with me till Jeannette came to pick me up to leave for Niagara.  I don’t know why I keep doing this…why why why….I may need professional help for real.  Here’s the other updates with the so called men in my life…  Wayne – finally heard from im by email yesterday.  Guess he didn’t remember it was my birthday.  All he had said was that he was available on Saturday and Monday for dinner and a movie at my place if I was available.  I wrote him back saying Monday would be ok and to write me back well it’s  Saturday and no word from him.  I don’t understand him.  Time to lose his number!!!  Johnathan – He called to say happy b’day.  Then also called me while I’ve been away.  Jeannette says to follow my instincts and leave this one alone.  Reggie – called to say happy birthday.   Wanted to make sure we were still planning to meet up on the 25th in Windsor.   If I can get the money together I’m going.  Why not  Steve – Called to wish me a happy b’day and called again to see if I reached Niagara ok.  How sweet  BUT I tried calling him tonight and no answer   Oh well story of  my life.  G2 – Got me all screwed up once again.  I called him tonight and he told me he was sleeping.  Said he was going to a club with Wally.l  ya  ok…urghhhhhh  back to the same question.  Why do I do this to myself???  Well my weekend away has been good.  I’m exhausted and broke.  Spent way to much money and I’m now in the hole, still owe  Jeannette  $$$ for room and tonight’s meal,  I seriously need to take a look at finances.  I’m drowning.  Aahhhhhh  I’m going to sign off since my wrists are killing me from the slot machine ..lol  Peace  Kat   June 16th  Well I haven't written once again since I was staying at the hotel on the weekend.  It's now Wednesday..damn I have to try and remember everything again....  Sunday - Came home from trip broker then broke.  I need to do something about my finances I'm getting into a deep deep hole.  Living paycheck to paycheck.  Need to get me a part time job or something.  sigh...  G ended up coming over for what else...yup a roll in the hay.  Can't blame him since I'm the horny one. Big time.  My period is due therefore my hormones are all crazy.    Monday - Went to work. Went pretty good.  Got a message on one of the dating sites which I'll fill you in later.  His name is Frank from Michigan.  Monday nite G came over and actually spent the night.  Was a pretty good session.  Kathy don't fall into this damn trap again  Tuesday - yesterday.  Work was same old shit just a different day.  After work G came over but  not for long because he had to take his niece back home.  I was ok with it though because I wanted to chat with Frank from online.  Which we did. Even exchanged phone numbers and talked for over an hour.  Funny guy.  A little strange but then again he grew up on a farm.  lol  Wed - That would be today.  Was a pretty good day up until 10 minutes ago when I basically hung up on G2 once again. Fuck when will I ever learn.  sigh  Someone just put me out of my misery or take me away from all this shit.  Urghhhh  He was suppose to come over for some fajitas after he dropped off his daughter and he calls me to say he's not coming now that he's to tired.  Bull shit. He made other plans to either talk or see one of his twats.  Fuck him man.  When will I ever get it through my thick head he's not worth it.  Anyways the rest of the day went well...changing the subject so I can breathe normally again.  I spent the whole day online chatting with Frank.  From 9 a.m. - 4 p.m. then I got home and he called me.  So cute.  I think he may be falling for me a bit.  Figures another american.  Why can't I find a decent guy in Toronto.  Where are all the good guys gone?  Chatted with Johnathan online for a few minutes.  I truly think this guys a playa.  He makes up so many excuses as to why he can't take my calls...he told me Monday nite he couldn't because he had a headache.  The night before that it was because he was in the next room.  Urghhhhh  I need to break the news to Reggie that I'm not going to Windsor to see him.  He can be such an immature jerk.  I don't want to waste my time.  To young.  Lets see who else...lmao  Thats it.  Need new prospects because this list is dead. lol  I think it would be easier to win the damn lotter then to find a decent man to settle down with.  Well my fingers are tired.  Going to put my fajitas away and head to the bedroom to relax.  I might even call Frank back to take my mind off of G.  That will work  ~~peace~~  Kat

      Yet another uneventful day..sigh.  we had a heatwave today..Damn it was hot.  But now i'm so happy I'm back in air conditioning..ahhhh.     Work was the usual..BORING.  Uneventful.  at lunch Nellie took me to the mall with her and bought me a bikini for my b'day.  It actually looks nice.  I never in my wildest dreams ever thought i'd wear a bikini but I'm at the point in my life i don't care what people think of what I wear.  If it feels good and looks ok then that's good enough for moi. lol  Well today is day number 5...no G2 in my life.  Still feeling sad but have yet to cry over losing him.  It was a difficult day trying to keep my hand off the phone to call him and see how his appt went for a commercial job.  :-(  Damn it.  Damn him.  Why the fuck did he have to go and screw things up.  Things could have been so good between us.  Urghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  Ok Kat snap out of it.  Think of all the lies he told you. Think about all the women he has talked to while still dating you.    I know I'll be ok.  Someone will come along eventually that is compatible with me and over time the pain in my heart will lessen.  Last nite I didn't talk to one man. Can you believe that!!!  I shut my computer off and went to bed.  Watched tv until it started watching me.  Turned it off just after 1 a.m.  Actually woke up on time. Woohoo.  Tomorrow nite I'll be going out to dinner with Nellie, Fatima Tracy and Mary.  Should be fun.  As long as we don't sit around talking about men that is.  Not to keen about Tracy going.  Can't stand being around her anymore since I moved out.  Controlling b****.    I need to pack tonight as well. J's picking me up on Friday morning at 10 to leave for Niagara Falls. Woohoo...Here's hoping I run into some luck and end up winning a jackpot. Or tonights 649 jackpot tonight which is 17 mill.  Ahhh just imagine how different my life could be.  Sigh  Well nothing more to report so I'll sign off and start straightening up my place.  I'm ver tempted to give Warren a call just to get laid right now. But....i keep telling myself no that's not what you need.  I've had enough sex this past year to keep me satisfied for awhile.  lol  Well maybe not.  I'm a nymph ok....I've admited it!!!!!!!!!!!  lol  Need nymph annonymous! lmao  You gotta love my sense of humour sometimes.  Well till tomorrow........   update....phone rang twice & I almost let my guard down  Luther called from Georgia I didn't answer ...he just left voice mail.  Why do the wrong  ones have to fall for me.  Johnathan called on his way to the station.  All small talk. Said he'd call me back later but I won't hold my breathe  Next..... confession I unblocked G from yahoo....then blocked him again.  he wasn't online phew...what is my problem....  peace  Kat

      Well it's Tuesday. Three more days till b'day.    Last nite I ended up talking with a few guys.....  Will a.k.a. Milkman - we chatted on phone and web cam.  Haven't talked to him for awhile.  Reggie - said he never got my calls.  Ya ok...he still wants me to meet him in Windsor.  I may just go for the hell of it.  He seems real..and cool.  Not to mention he's a cutey.  Johnathan - I called to say g'nite and we ended up talking for an hour.   Found out he was talking with his ex the night before that's why he didn't call me back for an hour.   Hmmmm can you say suspicious and drama.  He said he's in love with me and wanted me to say the same back to him.  Told him I couldn't  it's way to soon for me!!!  Well it's day number four no G#2 in my life.  I can't help but look to see if he's online.  He always is, so I don't know why I'm torturing myself.  :(.  sigh....everything is going to be ok........keep telling myself this.  After work I went tanning.  Felt good as usual.  I found a park bench and sat on it for awhile.  It was so tranquil. Wish I would have had a notepad just to sit there and write...Going back for sure.  Have tired eyes so I'm just going to head to bed early.  Don't feel like chatting with anyone tonight.  Yes I'm feeling ok lol    I'll be back tomorrow...  peace  Kat

      I'm sitting here at work on my lunch...bored.  I could be doing a million and one things but I decided to write instead.  Plus it will keep me from checking to see if G#2 is online.  Why do I need to know this?  Damn it.  Last nite was a quiet evening.  My phone didn't even ring.  Oh sorry it did.  Luther (Washington) called but ughhhh no thanks...and I had called Johnathan twice (once he didn't answer at all at 10 and when I called back at 11 to say g'nite he told me he was on another call and that he'd call me back.  I said will he be long because I was going to sleep and he said no..call you back in a few.  Doesn't he call back at 12:30 in the morning. I didn't answer.  Fuck this shit.  Men make me so sick with there games they play.  Haven't heard from Wayne since that email on Saturday so no hot dates this week.  I tried to call Reggie (my Kalamazoo guy) no answer...urghhh...wanted to talk to someone but no luck.  Oh well ended up watching Sex in the city and going to bed.     6:45 p.m.  Well I'm home...bored again.  Urghhhhh.  Just finished watching Cornation St. and Dr Phil...whippeedoo...My fault I need to get out of here so I'm not so damn bored.  Like I always say there are a million things i can do I just need to get off my fat azz and do it.   I rec'd a birthday card from my Dad and Annie.  No letter or anything..just happy b'day.  Yup another b'day coming up and i'll be spending it without a man.  I found an old book that I'm going to open up tonight...It's called..If I'm so wonderful then why am I still single.  Hopefully it helps..cause I need it...  Today was a rough day with regards to thinking and missing G#2.  I don't know why.  It's day number 3 without him in my life.  I can do it...I need to get over him.  I checked to see if he's on lavalife and he was so some things haven't changed.  He's got the whole house to himself as well so he must be really partying it up.  Oh well.  I never did hear from any men today...Johnathan, Wayne or Reggie which are the main one's right now..  I give up...maybe I should look at women instead of men.  I will never understand men that's for sure.  TGired of the games.  Well going to read book now.  I'm sure nothing exciting will be happening so i will say g'nite now...  peace...  Kat

      Well it turned out to be an ok weekend after all.  I called Nellie to see how she was doing. She was suppose to go to the  movies with some guy but changed her mind once she found out that Carole stood me up.  So she made the suggestion of getting dolled up and go out.  whipppeee....We ended up just walking over to JA  but we had a great time.  cutting up people, men watching.  Flirting.  lol  Came home...a bit drunk.  Scott called me from San Fran...he wanted to get hot...but I wasn't into him at the moment.  got off the phone and called johnathan.  Talked till 2:30.  Damn...this guy does it for me.  I should have taken the trip. :-(  He called me three time today as well.  So sweet.    don't remember if I wrote this yesterday but rec'd an email from Wayne saying that he'd like to do movies and dinner as long as he brings the movie and I make the home cooked dinner.  I emailed him back right away and the bugger has yet to get back to me.  I was kind of hoping for a date tomorrow nite...oh well.    Today I got up with a hangover but was determined not to lay around.  Went tanning.  Then to the bookstore.  Bought a couple of things. Now I'm watching Sex in the city and relaxing.  Ahhhhh...  That's it for now....will write again if something spectacular happens..hahahaha...  peace..  Kat

      Wow...again. I didn't write all week.  It's Saturday morning and I should be out enjoying this lovely day.  Sunshine!!  But instead I'm walking around my apt like I don't have a clue what I'm doing.  I did recieve a phone call this morning from G #2.  He stopped by here with the kids about an hour ago and dropped off a birthday present for me.  I gave the kids 25 dollars each for them to enjoy there time at the fair where G#2 was taking them.  All three are getting so big.  Damn I am getting old since when I met G#2 I was changing Rachel's diapers.  Yikes.  Well let me retrace my steps of the week. If I can remember...lol  I am getting older remember...  First of all G and are off again. This time for good.  I know I know I've said this a million and one times. But last night was it for me.  Ok back to retracing my days  Hmmm scratching head. I dont'remember them all by the day but I'll just tell you what I can recall.  Wednesday - Date with Wayne Thursday -  G came over/nothing Friday -    G came over/nothing (it's over with G2)  Well on Wednesday I ended up meeting with Wayne for coffee.  We met at 5 at Yonge and Sheppard coffee place.  He was a few minutes late.  I almost didn't show because I woke up with a huge bump on my lip.  Just my luck.  Woke up late...rushed around...found bump on lip which couldn't hide. Oh ya and don't let me forget the bad hair day.  Well he showed up and I explained about the lip and hair. lol He said he would have never noticed if I didn't point it out to him *yeah right*  Anyways we were only suppose to be there for an hour or so because he had a chess tournament.  Well we left at 9 p.m. (four hours of talking) I had a really good time especially since there was no pressure, I wasn't nervous at all.  Conversation just flowed and when I asked him don't you have to get going he said nahhh it's ok.  lol  So I assume he was enjoying himself.  He's soooooooooooooooo cute.  I couldn't stop staring at him and he kept complimenting me on my eyes and smile.  Ahhhhhhhhhhh  thump thump thump...when it was all over we walked to the subway and we hugged good bye. Left it up to him to get back to me.  Reached home at about 10.  G#2 called since he knew I was on a date. Unlike him I didn't hide it or lie about it.  We chatted for a bit but I was so wired with all the coffee I had in me and he wasn't tired he asked if he could come by.  Said why not...use him for sex which I did *grin* He ended up sleeping over.    Thursday...nothing exciting.  Sent an email to Wayne thanking him for yesterday.  No response.  No phone call.  Oh well. He's not an internet addict like myself so I wasn't really that surprised.  Came straight home G came over for a bit and then left at 2:00 a.m..  Yes we're sex addicts. but not without a price.  I don't know how these women have sex without any emotional connection with a man.  Maybe I'm just to damn sentimental/emotional.  Need to work on that one.  Toughen up a bit.    Friday...woke up really really late. Got to work at 9 a.m. damn.  I need to smarten up at work.  tsk tsk.  Wayne called me.  thump thump...I was on cloud nine.  He said he'd call back after lunch but he got rapped up in meetings and didn't leave till 7 p.m. then he went for drinks with some collegues.  I know this because I called his celly.  Left a message and he called me back.  Told me he'll call me sometime this weekend. hmmmm Talking to self....don't let yourself fall for this guy and get hurt.  I don't know how genuinely interested he is or not.  Play it cool....play it cool...  After work I ended up going to a shoe store and bought two pairs of shoes.  There nice.  I shouldn't have though because I really can't afford to. But fuck it.  I deserve something right.  Work so damn hard and get nothing most of the time.  Carole called me when I got home and cancelled this weekend.  I knew she was going to cancel.  Said something about money etc.  Ya ok.  Whatever that's fine don't need to rush around here cleaning up or shopping for food.  I did and still do want to go out tonight though (Saturday) still have to figure out what to do with myself. G called me and picked me up at the store.  He was horny...I was horny.  He was here from 6 - 9.  Told me he'll call me later after he knew if he had the car or not.  Well I decided to call him at 10:30 to see what was going on. He wants on the phone with one of his twats.  I got pissed off. I said damn you don't wait very long after fucking me to get onto your next victim do you. He got mad.  I ended up sending him an email telling him to fuck off and to enjoy his twats because I'm done with him and his bullshit.  He's not going to use me like a fucking whore.  At least with me there are men that I'm talking to but they never come between G and I especially in the sex equation.  This is good for me though because I don't need that fucking low life.  Let him try and replace me.  Enough is enough.  and I mean it this time. Stop laughing if you've been reading this whole journal.  I know I sound like a broken record but hey like I said..to many emotional feelings involved.  Here's hoping that things do work out with Wayne.  Fingers crossed.    Othere status's on men ....  NMFireman is upset because I cancelled trip. Oh well.  Don't need the damn drama Reggie called today....still wants to meet up with me on the 26th.  Said he'll pay for the hotel if I make my way down to Windsor.  (tempting)  Steve - never heard me talk about him.  He's a guy that lives in Montreal that I've only really talked to a couple of times.  Met him on lavalife.  Anyways he emailed me today asking if I'd like to get to get together with him for a drink when he comes down from Montreal this summer.  I emailed him back and said sure...call me and gave him my celly number.  He wrote back great....and that he'll call me,...gave me his celly number as well.  Have nothing to lose!!  Andrew - he's in Toronto...rec'd an email from him asking how I was and if I wanted to get together this weekend.  I replied and said I was busy...blah blah..I didn't really like his picture he sent me that's why I cancelled the last date that we had scheduled coffee.  Don't like his voice either. lmao  Hey just being honest.  Michael - he's in Toronto...chatted with him for the past year. Met him on bp.  He's another one that I have avoided. Even deleted from my lists.  Just didn't get a good vibe. Anyways he sent me an email out of the blue this morning asking how I was doing.  I emailed him back..I was fine blah blah blah.  lol   Maybe I should get together with these men why not.  Coffee doesn't hurt right.  Steve - San Fran - hardly ever talk to him but he messages me all the time. Small talk.  He called last nite at 12:30 but I didn't answer.  Just wasn't in the mood.  Warren - called last week to get together.  I've been avoiding this since I know this one there is sexual chemistry.  Afraid to jump into bed with him.  He's not ready for a real relationship and I don't know how many women he's been with.  hmmm at least he'll be a good back up for G2's place if I'm just interested in sex.  lol The ironic thing about it is that G hates this guy with a passion.  ha ha ha  Still talking to a few more american men online chat.  Nothing really...just small talk.  I think I'll stick with local men though.    Just going to take it one day at a time.  The right man will cross my path. I hope!!  Well I'm going to get off this computer and do something constructive. *smile*  Will write later if I don't have any hot dates tonight. ha ha ha  Guess that means I'll be back. lol  ~~peace~~  Kat

      Wow another couple of days have passed by and I didn't write about them.  Not like I have a life or anything or am to busy that's for sure.  Hmmm must be my forgetfulness since I will be older in another week *sigh*   Well first of all confession time...I screwed up again.  Had G over here on Saturday nite, Sunday and Monday....he's coming over in a few minutes but it's only because he forgot his cell phone here.  Lord forbid he doesn't have that attached to his waist.  Of course I snooped and found out that he had 79 phone numbers hidden in a separate address book on there. After telling me about two months ago that he was fed up with all those women and erased them all..ha ha ha typical lying G.  Well I'm actually starting to see the light now.  For real. No joking I am.  Why do I love him???Why?? He can't offer me shit other then a good lay now and then.  Then a bunch of heartache which is it really worth it NOOOOOOOOOOO it's not.  So even though he's been here for the past few nites I decided to live my dating life as well.  I have to tell you what happened before G even came back into my life on Saturday nite.    There's a guy in NM that's a fireman.  We have good chats and stuff..well he called me about twenty times on Saturday.  Finally convinced me that it would be a good idea that I come down there next weekend.  Ahh the power of persuasion.  Well I kept thinking about it.  He looked up flights and finally at around 10 p.m.  I booked a flight.  Shocked myself that I could be so spontaneous.  But that's what many nites/days alone will do to ya.  I used a credit card and didn't think it would go through but it went through that part of the process.  Anyways he was all excited and so was I.  He's gorgeous. This man should not be on the market that's for sure.  Anyways....my credit card ended up rejecting the transaction but I only found out about it today because it was a holiday down in the US.  I think that everything happens for a reason.  The reason I'm saying this is that I started to have some second thoughts about going down there yesterday while I was talking to J on the phone.  We were talking on his cell phone and his home line rang.  It was his ex.  Apparently his kid was sick and what he calls his psychotic ex wife was making a big stink because he wouldn't go to the hospital with her.  He was cussin her out and everything. I was actually very embarrassed to hear all this.  When he came back to my line he apologized and continued to talk softly as if nothing happened.  Red flag!!!  Then another thing happened.  I called his cell phone last nite and there was no answer...but his answering machine came on and his mail box was full. Hmmmm Second red flag!!!  When he called me later I asked him about the voicemail being full and he said it's always full because his ex keeps leaving all kinds of crazy messages. Everytime he empties the box she fills it up again.  Oh lord....not again...DRAMA!!!!!!!!!  f(**$ why me?  Anyways I sent him an email today and told him I wouldn't be coming down because of the visa reason not because I have doubts about meeting him.  Gorgeous or not I'm not going to put myself in another drama scenario.  Urghhhhhh  Reggie called me at work today.  Was actually cute and sweet.  He's a nice guy. May just have to pursue him...lmao  If nothing else he can become a boytoy...lmao  just kiddn'  G is here so I'll write later.............  10:30...  Well G was here and now he's gone.  I am sooooo fucking pissed.  He comes over here all pissed off at his mom, says he has a headache...we ate pizza, laid down and he talked his heart out about moving out, all the stress he's under etc.  I gave him one of my pep talks...all seemed ok...even had sex but he couldn't perform fully because he had just masturbated a few hours ago.  Forgiven...lol  I was satisfied. Then he goes to the washroom comes back and says...I think I'm going to head home now to clear my head.  I said are you sure your ok...he said ya I just need to be alone.  Then I decided to call him to make sure he got home ok since he didn't seem very with it and guess what...the fucking man is going out for drinks with Nick.  What the fuck is all that about.  I'm sure it was planned for 10:30 because he left here at 10.  That fucking scum just came over here for his cell phone and pizza.  Used me once again...by making me sit through all his ranting and raves about his family and then goes and does that on me.  Fine well you know what he better not call me crying that he's alone and no one understands him because I'm not answering.  I told him to fuck off and don't call back.  I am so fucking stupid where he is concerned.  but he must think I am as well to get away with all his little fucking games that he's been playing.  Well screw that shit.  I'm going out tomorrow, going to book more dates for next week.  Oh ya and Carole and I talked earlier before G got here and I told her about the fireman and what happened.  Well she's been screwed around by her boy to so she suggested that we go for drinks and get drunk on Saturday nite which is fine by me since I need it as much as she does.  I'm going for coffee with Wayne...guy that I have been chatting with for four or five years now...lol  We're meeting after work tomorrow...why not. YOu only live once right.  I am going to get over G and not let my guard down if he calls back...........Lord give me strength!!  It's hard keeping this secret that I was still sleeping with G.  Everyone would should me or take me to a shrink and have my head examined.  Oh well my head is pounding right now from all that swearing...going to lie down and try to go to bed early.  Nite...

      Yup I did it to myself again.  Last nite I was really feeling low and wanted to talk to G to make sure he was ok.  Why you ask? I don't fucking know.  I guess I like to torture myself.  He answered all happy.  All he wanted to konw is if I changed my mind.  We talked for over an hour in circles.  I did find out that he hasn't loved me since last year. He's been seeing that chick Deanna for longer then I knew about and is still seeing her.  I got so pissed off I called her after my conversation with him and left a long message saying that I was pregnant and that I was keeping it and that she's fucking stupid and deserves whatever she gets because I warned her.  Stupid bitch.  Apparently G says he has lots of support from his "female" friends and that they all are on his side. I don't give to shits now.  I am determined to think of myself as a single mom and the donor was a sperm bank as far as I'm concerned.  I'm sorry I ever met that selfish bastard.  Anyways enough of that.  I don't want to mention him on here anymore.  For now on this is going to be my baby journal of a single mother to be.   My brother came over today and bought my old computer off of me for 300.00 :-)  Finally.  I spent my morning cleaning all the crap off of it.  Hope I got everything.  lol  He just left a few minutes ago and I'm about to head to bed to take a well deserved nap.   Luther called me today.  You know even though I'm not interested in him in a "relationship" kind of way he is really a sweet man.  Said he would marry me and take care of my kid he's just waiting for my words. lol  I think he's serious which scary.  Oh ya and G3. He's gone so fast.  I didn't even have time to type all the words and the man ran offline lastnite.  lmao  Which is fine with me.  Boy this is all I had to say to get rid of all these guys. lol  I hate men right now.  There the last thing I want to think about.  Just going to take care of myself and see to it that I make it through the next 7 or 8 months depending on how prego I am.  Going for nap now...  peace  Kat

      Well it's one week ago today that I took that home pregnancy test. *sigh* Today is day number five since I heard from G as well.&nbsp; I'm hurting big time inside.&nbsp; I'm scared, sad, numb.&nbsp; I called the clinic today and they said that they are arranging my appointment with the doctor.&nbsp; I need to follow up tomorrow.&nbsp; I cannot believe that I can't do up my pants.&nbsp; I have bloated out like a cow.&nbsp; I know it's not the baby since that's the size of a pea but all of a sudden my stomach just ballooned.&nbsp; My boobs are sore now to.&nbsp; Damn one minute no signs of pregnancy, next it all hits at once.&nbsp; I emailed a few of my internet buddies to let them know what's going on.&nbsp; I was surprised at a few responses.&nbsp; Thought they would run so fast but they actually didn't.&nbsp; Gave me there support one even emailed me back saying he didn't care and if it worked out perhaps I wouldn't have to raise the kid alone.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; I cannot even phantom bringing anyone into my life right now.&nbsp; I am still very upset about the whole G thing.&nbsp; I wonder constantly if he's ok and what he's doing.&nbsp; I hope he didn't wreck his business like he said he was going to.&nbsp; I pray that one day he'll come around and try and see things my way.&nbsp; I don't want to believe that he can be the type of man to just leave me just like that.&nbsp; After all we have been through.&nbsp; I know it's most likely just a pipe dream but I have to believe in my heart he really did love and care about me.&nbsp; Like I do him.&nbsp;   Anyways I'm going for my nap now. I've been taking one after work everyday because I can't sleep at nite.&nbsp; Toss and turn with so many things on my mind. *sigh*  Peace and a tear drop...  Kat

      Missed a few days...I've been really out of it lately.&nbsp; Sunday I went to the movies with Dan to try and take my mind off of things.&nbsp; After the movie I went home and checked email.&nbsp; G wrote me a last good bye email once again saying I have wrecked his life.&nbsp; After hours of debating on whether or not to&nbsp; write back I did.&nbsp; Wrote a novel.&nbsp; Haven't heard from him since.&nbsp; I am pretty distraught about the whole situation with the way he's taking this.&nbsp; But I realize that he is selfish and no matter what I am keeping this baby for me and no one else.&nbsp; he cannot force me to get rid of it.&nbsp; Got the blood results back and it's confirmed.&nbsp; Have to wait now for gyno appt that the clinic will set up.&nbsp; I called my brother today.&nbsp; He's pissed off about G but told me i'm better off without him which i hope i will realize soon. Well tonight hopefully my shows will take my mind off of things for a bit.&nbsp; My head is killing me.&nbsp;   peace...and a teardrop  kat

      Well the clock is clicking and I just want to sleep this weekend away to get comfirmation on Monday.&nbsp; Had&nbsp;another big fight with G on the phone.&nbsp; Can't believe he had his daughter with him and he's still begging me to have an abortion.&nbsp; He also told me today he doesn't love me and never will.&nbsp; Hates me as a matter of fact.&nbsp; I had enough of his putting me down so I just said I'm having the baby there's nothing he can do about it.&nbsp; If he thinks it's going to be a big secret he's wrong because I will be taking his ass to court no matter what to get child support and will definetely call his family so that they know.&nbsp; He actually believes that he can just run away from me and this situation without anyone knowing.&nbsp; Well sorry bud. Life is just not that fair.&nbsp;   Going to watch big brother 5 now.&nbsp; Will try and write later..  peace

      Well I woke up this morning and took the other test and it came back positive.&nbsp; Is this a joke or what?&nbsp; I had my nose dr appt at 9 and also found out that I need nose surgery.&nbsp; But I can't have the ct scan till I find out for sure if I'm pregnant or not.&nbsp; It has been one fucking crazy emotional day.&nbsp; After my appt&nbsp;G called me begging me to go ahead with the abortion.&nbsp; He also kept me on the phone for three hours last nite talking about it.&nbsp; Said I'm ruining his life.&nbsp; I told him I need space and to leave me alone.&nbsp; After calling me about 20 times for the day I finally agreed to meet him face to face.&nbsp; We met at Starbucks (i was worried he may become angry enough of be violent)&nbsp; We talked and it was just going around in circles.&nbsp; He said that his life is over if I go through with this baby and that I will never see or talk to him again since he will never accept it.&nbsp; Said he doesn't want anything to do with me or the baby no matter what.&nbsp; He's already made one mistake and will not do it again.&nbsp; I told him I haven't made up my mind about anything and that I had just got blood work (went to a walk in clinic) done and I'll know 100% on Monday if I am or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor at clinic said congratulations because the tests are pretty accurate.&nbsp; Fuck me man.&nbsp; I can't even get excited for something that I have always wanted because I'm scared shitless about having to raise the baby on my own.&nbsp; Damn G.&nbsp; Why does he have to be such an asshole.&nbsp; It didn't have to be this way.&nbsp; Anyways things emotionally got worse when he asked if we could just head back to my place to chill out because it was hot outside.&nbsp; I reluctantly said ok.&nbsp; We ended up hugging in bed and crying.&nbsp; Then ended up fucking.&nbsp; He came twice in me.&nbsp; Guess he figured since I was prego it didn't matter.&nbsp; But I think it just made things worse for me because I know that this man loves me and has feelings for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why can't he just let go of his stupid commitphobia and try and work things out.&nbsp; We're both reasonable adults but he seems to call himself a young guy.&nbsp; Tried to make me out to be the bad party even having enough nerve to say that I dooped him into cumming inside me all the time. Well hello buddy it takes two and after already having one he should know better.&nbsp; Well we talked around in circles again and again until he decided to call a cab and leave.&nbsp; I've already decided that I'm having the baby anyways and that there is no way in hell I would ever have an abortion after wanting to have a baby my whole life.&nbsp; Secondly I don't fucking care that he doesn't want to be in the childs life but he will be paying childsupport for sure.&nbsp; Fuck you Mr Timothy!!!!  He just called from downstairs to say that his taxi hadn't arrived.&nbsp; I called him back and it went into voicemail.&nbsp; Decided to investigate his voicemail since I know his number and low and behold Deanna has still been calling him everyday.&nbsp; What a fucking loser she is.&nbsp; Even after me calling her last week to tell her that he's been fucking me and talking to her she is still calling him.&nbsp; Well I may just have to wreck things even more by calling her to let her know he also got me pregnant.&nbsp; What a fucking goof.&nbsp; Once again like I said. Fuck him.&nbsp; I'm going to live my life in peace, if it is confirmed that I am pregnant I will have it on my own and will be just fine.  Well I'm going to calm down for a bit and stop writing about this asshole and the whole situation.&nbsp;   peace  Kat

      I'm in a state of shock right now.&nbsp; Let me retrace a day though...last nite for some reason I couldn't get G off my mind so I called him.&nbsp; He answered his cell phone and was out. (sounded like a coffee shop) he told me he was busy but asked if I was ok.&nbsp; I said I was ok and he said good...and then hung up.&nbsp; I got pissed off knowing very well he was on a date.&nbsp; He wouldn't pick up.&nbsp; I left a voice mail thanking him for hanging up on me and congratulating him on picking up the pieces so quickly.&nbsp; I also said I was calling for a reason but I guess I'll just handle it on my own.&nbsp; The a**hole doesn't call me back till this morning.&nbsp; Last night I couldn't friggn' sleep at all and kept tossing and turning it was driving me nuts.  Then today he called and left four messages for me at home, cell and work. But the work calls kept flooding in.&nbsp; He told me if I didn't answer the phone that he was going to come into work.&nbsp; So I called him back on my cell phone in the meeting room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him the reason I was calling was because I was pregnant but not to worry because I would get rid of it just like I had promised him I would.&nbsp; He must have called back about 20 times throughout the day.&nbsp; Said he is a bad man for what he put me through and can't believe he has made such a mess out of my life now.&nbsp; Told him shit happens and we have to move on.&nbsp; Well tonight I bought a pregnancy test.&nbsp; I have done about 100 over the years and know what to look for but I almost fell off the toilet when I seen two straight lines.&nbsp; One is fainter then then other though. Could I actually be fucking pregnant.&nbsp; No way!!&nbsp; I was freaked out and had to call my stepmom to discuss.&nbsp; She told me not to jump the gun and to test again in a couple of days or go get blood work done.&nbsp; In all the times I have ever done tests though it was always clear only one line not two.&nbsp; But then again I did buy a no name brand.&nbsp; Shit....well I'm going to take another test again in the morning and see what happens. If it's only one line then for sure the first one was a mistake if it's two lines again I will go to a walk in clinic and get tested.&nbsp; It would be a miracle if I was pregnant.&nbsp; I have wanted a baby for as long as I can remember but never could because of my ovary problems.&nbsp; OMG just thinking about it freaks me out.&nbsp; I hope the night goes by fast because I want to retake the test.   Well I'm freezing since I left the air conditioner on all day today.&nbsp; So I'm going to hop into bed and catch some zzz's hopefully.   Wish me luck.&nbsp; I hope in the bottom of my heart that I am but I doubt it.&nbsp; It's most likely a mistake.   peace

      Well it's been one week since I have seen or talked to G2.&nbsp; The week went by quickly for some reason.&nbsp; Perhaps I've been keeping busy and staying out later then usual instead of coming straight home.&nbsp; Have seen movies, read books, hung out in book stores and went up north for the weekend.&nbsp; Well I have thought about him everyday and it hurts inside to know that it really is over but I know that the pain will lessen eventually.&nbsp; Someone will come along and I'll be saying G who.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; That will be awhile I'm sure.&nbsp; But int he meantime there are a few people that make me laugh, make me feel good and fill in the void since he's been out of the picture.&nbsp; I just wish I could get some of my thoughts out of my head...That's the hardest part.&nbsp; I'm not lonely (even though it's been a week since I've had sex lol)&nbsp; But I did buy a new shower massager *wink*  Oh ya Kevin is back in the US from Iraq for a race.&nbsp; He says that he is going to send me my money but I don't believe him. It's been a few years and he hasn't kept any other promises so why now especially if we're not together and haven't been for some time.&nbsp; He did send me pics of him over there and he looks really good.&nbsp; He has a goatee and lost weight.&nbsp; Actually brought a tear to my eye but then I remember the psychotic side to him and I'm back to reality again.&nbsp; Urghhh Men.&nbsp;   Well I'm going to practice a bit of graphics and chill out for a bit.&nbsp; I'll write later if I think of anything important I forgot to write.&nbsp; lol Don't hold your breathe though.&nbsp; :-)  peace  Kat

      Wow it's been a few weeks since I've written.&nbsp; I'm not even going to try to go back in time to figure out what I've been up to.&nbsp; The most recent and major thing that has transpired will shock the hell out of you though. &nbsp; I finally came to the end of my rope with G2.&nbsp; Last Wednesday nite he was at my house and I basically snapped.&nbsp; I knew for awhile now that he's been hooking up with this chick and carrying on with me as well.&nbsp; Her name is Deanna.&nbsp; Well I have her phone and never dreamed I would actually carry out on my threat to him to call her. Well I did.&nbsp; I just came to a brick wall as far as him not being fair to me.&nbsp; He used me emotionally.&nbsp; Yes you can say I used him physically but for that it takes two to agree upon and he was always ready to go.&nbsp; The three days before that though he hasn't been able to perform and in my mind since the shoot is over it's not about work that he can't keep it up or perform it's about feeling guilty because some other chick is on his mind.&nbsp; I had found out that she had been calling him everyday even though he swears to me he would just ignore her or they were five minute conversations.&nbsp; How many lies can one man tell?&nbsp; Well this is for the best.&nbsp; I haven't heard from him since then and I don't really give to shits about him right now.&nbsp; He's scum as far as I'm concerned.&nbsp; &nbsp; I went up north this weekend just to get away and try and take my mind off the whole situation.&nbsp; It worked except for at nitetime when my mind would start to roll out some crazy shit.&nbsp; I'm determined to make sure that I do what I have to do in order to get over this once and for all.&nbsp; I'm not only driving myself crazy but I'm driving everyone around me nuts.&nbsp; I made sure to tell everyone that if they so much as here me think about him out loud to slap me in the head.&nbsp; It's fucking hard but I have to do this.&nbsp; It's a dead end relationship and I know it!!!! &nbsp; Well there are about five hundred things I could type about but I just want off this computer and to go lie down for a bit.&nbsp; I'm tired out from the weekend.&nbsp; Went to see I-Robot and Dodge Ball at the drive in which was cool.&nbsp; Then J's parents had a backyard party with about 35 people which turned out great as well.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'll try and get back here later to finish up on my writings otherwise I'll be back whenever...lol&nbsp; Nah I'm going to try and do this on a daily basis.&nbsp; I did say TRY..lol &nbsp; peace &nbsp; Kat

      Well today is Sunday and it's back to work tomorrow. It feels like I've been off for so long but it's only been three days. I am so dreading going back there. I wish I could just run away. I know I can't I have to face reality but it's difficult :-( G came over last nite but really didn't want to be here. We ended up having a spat. Wrong time to pick fights with me when I'm giong through so much turmoil in my heart and in my head not to mention my hormones. Well he decided this morning that we need to make a clean break once again so he can do his soul searching. Am I upset. yes. Do I know that this is the reality I must accept? yes again. I have to let him go. Why am I hanging on to something that just will not be there for him. I'm living in a fantasy world of what if's and it's driving me crazy. I need help. I do. I can't deal with this on my own. Before this all started I tried reading the self help books and for awhile it helped but now I'm feeling as torn apart and even worse because of what happened. This morning my g/f was online who knows what happened but not what's going on with G. I told her everything. She's furious with me to even consider that there is a possibility or hope for the two of us. She said I should have depending on my g/friends that love and care about me and not him. So she's hopping in her car and taking me out for lunch to have a talk. Do I want to deal with this? Noooo. I so want to go to sleep and wake up a new woman with a new attitude. I've done it before why am I finding it so difficult to deal with this. Well I better go straighten up my apt before she gets here to give me the third degree. I will check back later if I'm up to it.  ~~peace~~  9:34 p.m.  Well Carole came over and dragged me over to the mall for lunch. It was good getting out for some fresh air. Went to walmart and picked up the things I needed. She didn't stay long but long enough to give me a lecture about G. I know and hear what she's saying I just have to realize it's over and to be strong to come out of this in one piece. Surprised today by getting a call from Warren. Haven't heard from him in ages. I told him what happened and he felt sorry for me. Said that he will take me for drinks sometime soon or will bring over a movie to watch. He's a nice guy. A workaholic that's for sure but he is nice. I think last year I should have gone out with him instead of G. I met them around the same time. Actually I met Warren first now that I think about it. I think it was because g had more time and came over everyday when we first met. didn't give Warren a fair chance. Anyways he's just a friend that's all I want right now. I was online tonight and Sam from Seattle popped online. I told him about the baby and he called me right away. He's another nice guy that is very caring. He's screwed up by all these teenie boppers though. Just looking for sex. I watched a bit of tv and then came back online to type this. G was online and typed a note to me just saying that he has a busy week this week and that he's just relaxing at home. He'll probably be up all nite because he slept for a few hours after Bree went home. No mention of how are you etc. Just all about G. Oh well this will most likely dwindle down.    10:21  Was typing in journal when I rec'd an email from a website that I totally forgot about saying I had mail waiting.  It's a site where women that want to make new friends (no lezbo's just friends) hook up for drinks etc.  I only met one woman on there which she was snotty and didn't have anything in common with me so it didn't work out.  Anyways this woman sent me a note saying she's new to T.O. and if I was interested in doing thing to let her know.  I emailed her back with my yahoo id and she popped online right away.  She seems nice.  Hey you can never have to many friends right.  Anyways while i was typing to her G came on msn and asked if he could come over for a bit.  told him it was late already but I wouldn't mind if I saw him.  He's on his way over now.  It's only for an hour.  Damn we spent all this time together what is another hour going to hurt.  I know the answer to that one...It's me right.  Yup....anyways hopefully tomorrow things will look a lil brighter.  wish me luck...  ~~g'nite~~peace~~  Kat

      Well I haven't been writing for a few days because my life has taken a turn for the worst...let me retrace my steps. Tuesday nite I ended up getting so down that I called G to talk to him. He couldn't talk because he had family in the house and said he would come over. He came over and we had a long conversation. He was actually wrapping his head around the whole situation and said that he does want to be a part of the childs life etc. He said that it was over with him an Deanna and that there wasn't really anything there that she just took it to the next level when he told her that he just wanted to be friends. I wanted to believe him. Just before he left I asked him for a hug. The hug was so intense I kissed him. He tried to resist a little bit but then gave in and we ended up in bed. Now is where the sad part comes in. When I got off from on top of him I noticed blood all over me. I was bleeding internally. I ran into the bathroom and started crying. G was all freaked out saying that it was all his fault. I took a shower and he came in and blood just kept flowing, It was all over him as well. Looked like someone got stabbed. I knew at that moment that I had miscarriaged. I was shocked and devastated. G took me to the hospital. I told him to go home because I was just so emotional and I knew I'd be there for hours which I was. He told me to call him no matter what time so he could pick me up. The doctor came in and did an internal. Said it does appear to be a miscarriage but the only way to know for sure is if I have an ultrasound but that I would have to come back the next day.  I called g afterwards and he came to pick me up.  He spent the night with me just holding me while I cried.  We were up till 3 a.m. talking.  He felt so bad with what happened and thought it was his fault.  The next morning I went for my ultrasound.  I was so upset I puked three times before I even left the house.  The ultrasound showed that I was six weeks pregnant and that the baby had no heartbeat.  Apparently though the baby's heart starts beating right at 6 weeks so the doctor said that I could wait to see what happens and come back in a week and have another one done.  He has got to be crazy I thought to myself.  There is no way I am going to be able to survive emotionally knowing that the baby that I have inside me is late forming into an embryo and doesn't have a heartbeat just to prolong the agony for a week and go through all this again.  when I talked with the next doctor it was agreed that I would have to have surgery to do a d&c.  they had me on a bed with intervinace (can't spell it) by noon on Wednesday.  But I had to wait 9 hours before I actually had the surgery.  G stayed with me almost the whole time but he had to go pick up his child from day care but then he came back after the surgery was over.   I had no more tears left. It's all over. :-(  I feel so empty and still numb and shocked how everything turned out. In addition to it the way that G and I have been since it happened.  He did put me straight yesterday telling me that nothing has changed and that he loves me but cannot commit to me therefore we do still have to let eachother go no matter how hard it is.   I know he's right but deep down inside I can't understand if two people love eachother so much why can't we be together.  He did get rid of the other girl Deanna.  The fucking bitch.  I don't know whether to believe everything that he says but he once again looked me in the eye and said that he is going to take some time out and do some soul searching which is the same thing that I must do.  This is so fucking hard to accept even though I know it has to be this way.  Here I sit bleeding because I lost a baby and I'm fucking thinking about why he doesn't want me the same way i want him.  He did tell me that things would have been different if I didn't lose the baby.  That in the back of his mind and in his heart he knew that he wouldn't leave me.  How comforting is that :-(  I don't know I have so many things on my mind I feel like I'm going to explode.  Everyone is worried about me especially Lois but I know I'll be ok.  It's just going to take some time.  Oh ya I did talk to my ex G1 and told him about the whole incident.  I think he was hurt but still cared about how i was.  All he said was at least you know that you can have kids now.  ya right.  After this whole tramatic experience I doubt it.   today is also the anniversary of my mom's death.  it's been 11 years since she passed away.  I didn't even have enough strength to leave my house to go up to the cemetary.  I know she's looking down at me and trying to comfort me.  I feel her precence around me and pray that she gives me the strength to get through this.   Anyways I'm going to lie down for a bit.  been sitting online like a zombie all day today.  I hope tomorrow is a better day because I have to get myself back up so i can go into work on Monday and face the music.   peace for now...  Kat

      Urghhhhhhhhhhhhhh....came home today to find a notice from the property management place.  My rent is going up by $35 dollars a month.  How the fuck am I going to be able to stay here with that kind of rent.  I'm going to have to think about moving now.  Shit man.  I've been in a crappy mood all day as well because I'm still pissed off about the whole G situation yesterday. I didn't end up changing my number because it's such a pain in the ass.  I'd have to let about 100 people/companies know and now if I might have to move why bother going through the expense.  How in the hell am I going to survive.  Let alone bring a baby into this world.  I'm about to crack.  To even torture myself more I went on the date site that G is on and low and behold he updated his profile with a new pic. Why do I do this to myself.  Why tell me why.  I need to get some kind of help for my G obsession which I think is what is happening.  How am I going to get it through my thick skull. He'll never be back, he doesn't love me, never has and he's been cheating on me all along.  Why the fuck would I want him back anyways.  I definetely need my head examined!!!  I just want to go to sleep right now and wake up and everything be peaceful again in my life.  When was the last time that has happened?  I can't even remember.  Anyways I'm just so confused and fucked up I think I will just go to bed. It's only 5 in the afternoon!!  tear drops...no peace today :-(  Kat

      Urghhhhhhhhhhh I'm changing my phone numbers tomorrow morning. I've had enough!  Today G decides to call me to ask me a stupid question all because he spoke to Jeannine (his ex in Edmonton) and got some advice from her.  What an asshole.  He said she even asked for my phone number to talk to me to know that it's not an easy life raising children on my own. She has two interracial kids from two different men.  But that's her story.  Fuck her.  Then to add to everything he spills his guts about him and Deanna's conversation.  Apparently the bitch is already telling him that if she were to be with him not to worry because she accepts the fact that he is going to have to children from two different women and that she's ok with it and will help him raise the kids.  Fuck her to.  She's not going near my child.  I've now decided there's no way I can live with the drama that I know would be involved if I had G in the baby's life.  So I've made up my mind.  I'm going to do this solo.  I told him today to that as far as I'm concerned this child was born from a sperm bank.  I no longer want to discuss anything with him and he can go on his marry old way and live his life with Deanna and make there own god damn babies together.  He called back to apologized and I just told him to fuck himself and that I'm changing my numbers tomorrow and he will not be hearing from me to so to stay the fuck out of my life.  He said he will.  I then told him to fuck off and hung up.  That was a couple of hours ago and I'm still fucking upset.  What a fucking asshole he is.  One minute it's have an abortion the next is oh ya by the way my new rebound girlfriend is going to stick this out with me. ha ha.  Well I'm going to have the last laugh he is not going to be apart of this life.  Got a call from the Dr's office.  I can't get an appointment with a gyno till Sept 13..damn six weeks away.  by then I'll really be showing.  Oh well what can you do.   Talked to Nellie and Lois about the whole situation.  I tell you BC is looking like a very good option right now. That's for sure.  We'll see.  One day at a time...one day at a time...  going to lay down....rough day!!   peace and a teardrop today  Kat

      Interesting day.  I got a phone call this morning from all people.  G.  Said he wanted to talk to me for five minutes.  Nothing bad just needed to see me.  I said what can you possibly say that you haven't told me already.  He pleaded. I caved and said sure.  He came up looking like he always does all wrinkley and rough looking.  Said he hasn't been able to sleep and he really needed to see me to apologize for everything.  He still doesn't think what I'm doing is fair to him but said he knows that I'm going through with it and wants me to know that he just can't accept this right now but perhaps once the baby is born he will want to take an active part in the kids life.  Wanted to make sure that I knew it was over between the two of us and that he has moved on and wished me luck.  Don't know why he had to come over to tell me this but he did.  I didn't feel anything when he was here. No tears. No anger. Nothing.  I am still feeling numb about the whole situation and I can't feel extatic that I am actually finally going to have a baby.  I'm felling very fat and bloated and I'm only weeks not even months into this pregnancy.  Can't wait to find out how far long I am.  I fell liked I'm three months already..lol  I was going to go downtown to the bookstore but ended up stopping at the mall, did some shopping, and came back home.  I'm on a puzzle kick right now.  Spent my whole night doing one and finished this morning so bought a couple more at the mall and have been working them all day and watching movies.  Didn't even realize what time it was.  Oh well no work tomorrow it's a holiday. Whippeeteeedoo.  I'm not even excited about the long weekend.  I have to be sick.   Oh well other then that I talked with Nellie and my brother today but all else seems to be quite.   I truly hope that G does want to play an active roll in this childs life.  He also said today that he would help me anyway possible.  As far as him and I being over.  I still have mixed feelings about the whole thing.  I'm still angry inside for him making me believe that he's been in love with me just to find out that he hasn't loved me for sometime.  And on top of that he's seeing some other girl.  I need to make sure I just concentrate on myself and baby right now.  Fuck men!!  Anyways going back to my bed to watch tv and do my puzzles.  Most likely will need a nap soon.   peace  Kat
