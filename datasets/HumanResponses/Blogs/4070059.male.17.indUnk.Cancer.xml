      I was reading an article today about public schools and why they are pointless.  Pretty good read, but what got my attention was a part about boredom.  sigh... boredom.  The author basically said that being bored was the person's own fault, and no othe person's responsibility to cure but their own.  I guess it's just me, but if I can help someone cure their boredom, I would.  I'm not gonna study the person and tell them what they like, but anything I could do I would.  Anyways, thinking about boredom, and what it really is, I came to the conclusion that nobody likes themselves.  Strange I guess.  U have nothing around u to arouse your interest, so u are only left with yourself.  When u are left with only yourself is when u are truly bored.  But that's me, maybe some people aren't like this, but I am.  Human's are social creatures.  I don't think we could live with out other people.  We would die of boredom.  I've always none this, but lately I've been experiencing it more.  anyways, just writing cuz i'm bored

      okay so i'm finally gonna bite and write in one these on-line journal dealies.&nbsp; dunno why but I been thinking about doin this recently even tho it's not really my thing.&nbsp; but sometimes writing stuff down just clears my head, and that'll help me sleep, hopefully.  last night trying to sleep i realized how much i was starting to miss my family =(&nbsp; iono why but i just started feeling kinda lonely, so I started thinking about friends and family, and thinking about them i realized how much time i actually spent with them.&nbsp; i live with family now, but it's not the same with my brother and dad, they almost seem more like room mates then family.&nbsp; I can talk to them but never personally, it's always about games or current events or something.&nbsp; but with my sister, little bro, and mom, it just seemed like i could always talk to them about anything, with no fear of how they would react.  It was the same with my friends in that area too.&nbsp; I could be my self around them.&nbsp; Lately it seems I've been to worried about how I act around people.&nbsp; I find myself&nbsp; acting like the person that I'm around, not that I look up to them or something, but&nbsp;because I'm too afraid of what other people think....... bleh! i need to get my priorities straight, if people don't like me then screw it.......... but i wanna be cool with everybody, no need&nbsp;to make enemies.  So with no real close people to talk to I&nbsp;get lonely =(&nbsp; Feels like i'm wasting too much time in front of the tv watching to shows i don't even like cuz i have nothing else to do.&nbsp; so i try to make new friends, or become better friends with existing ones... but it's difficult.&nbsp; The harder I try the harder it gets.&nbsp; I ask questions and i get just one word replies.&nbsp; Maybe people don't wanna open up to me cuz i haven't opened up to them.  I used to talk with one person in particular a lot.&nbsp; We were just cool like that.&nbsp; But then we just kinda stopped.&nbsp; iono why but it happened.&nbsp; this person just didn't seem to care about it, they once told me any kinda random event that was going on or how they felt but not anymore.&nbsp; i'm like not worth the time anymore or something.  Another old friend of mine, I tried to get in touch with this person again, as in start talking to them more.&nbsp; I tried but it just seemed like they didn't care.&nbsp; Same old story, one word replies and just a general dissinterest in what I said.&nbsp; Never talked to me or asked me questions.&nbsp; I did something kinda stupid just because I wanted to hang with them again.  hmmm.... i got more stuff to say but i gotta save it for the next time (if i don't already have dozens of other things on my mind)&nbsp; but basically me = sad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
