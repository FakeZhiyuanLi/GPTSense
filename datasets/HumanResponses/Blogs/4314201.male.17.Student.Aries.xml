      To you winter may not be the time to go to the pool, but to me it was perfect. It was, of course, far to cold for anyone to swim, but the club owners have unintentionally provided a new source of even greater amusement. They held the belief that if the pool was left uncovered it would freeze, and so they placed giant mats covering all of one half of the pool. To a full grown adult this would mean that you couldn’t swim. To a six year old it means you can run on top of the pool. It was an incredible sensation, and one that my brother and I cherished. The wonders of this mat didn’t end there, though; you could swim under the mat, and pop out of the seams. You could even make a bubble underneath the mat, and stay underwater for a full five minutes by breathing the air you had trapped there. For the longest time I saw this as nothing more than good clean fun with no major risks. For a time so much longer, I regretted that. It was an average Houston winter’s day; with a gray overcast sky and temperatures plunging all the way down to fifty. I had a new toy, a water gun, and was darting around firing haphazardly at my dad, who would splash me in return. I decided to improve the game, by going under the mat and not saying where I would come up. I would ambush him. I thought it was genius. I went to the edge of the pool where you could slip underneath, gun in hand, bursting with the incredible wellspring of energy that children whose years can be marked on their hands always seem to possess. I plunged underneath into a world of chlorine bleached plastic sky above, and hard concrete earth below. I exuberated in the feeling of being released from the shackles of gravity that have made fools of all humanity, and spun and turned in great loops. Bliss. A thought chided me, not one of urgency but of inconvenience.  Air would be nice . I felt that I had plenty and let myself exalt in the sensation once again. Again the voice in my head infringed upon my merriment, its tone was more desperate this time.  You really should get some air soon . Ok, fine. I turned to move towards the seam and burst forth, with the intention of once again merrily launching a salvo of water at my father. I turned again, and again, and again. Which way to go? In all my exuberance I had completely lost track of the path. If I went the wrong way I’d be going the length of the pool, a distance I couldn’t make on full lungs, much less on my now lightly-aching ones. My mind lunged into action; firing away with speed allotted to it only in the direst of circumstances  Which Way? Look for Shadows! I don’t see any! Shit! AIR! Where’re the stairs? Not enough light, I can’t tell! AIR. What now? AIR! Use James’s trick . How odd that my brother who I have attacked and been attacked by on regular occasion would be the one who would save me. I’d use his technique, and make an air bubble under the mat. Spinning to put my feet on the bottom I shoved upwards with all the strength I had left. Nothing. A familiar and infuriating voice rose up in my head, the voice of logic.  The air has to come from outside, you’re in the middle of the mat. You Can’t Lift The Whole Thing! Think Of Something Else! NOW!  I did think of something else. I thought about how I was going to die before reaching the age of 10. I thought about dying and being cast into hell for recklessness. I thought about dying as a virgin. I thought about the agony of finally knowing what happens when you die, but not being able to tell anyone. I thought about what I had done thus far. I thought about my first fight, which had been only weeks ago. I thought about Mackenzie and wondered if she would even care that I was dead. I thought about my brother tottering around on stilts trying to reach the towering height of our father. I thought about first learning to ride a bike. About the first time I went to the park near my house after dark. I thought about lying in a wooden cage with a padded floor in a distant place, curling tighter and tighter to keep warm while watching my brother stare at a glowing square heedless to my pain. It was a thought from before I had words. The image of those bars held itself in the forefront of my gradually collapsing mind. It faded to meaningless lines.  Lines. The lane lines! Go against them! NOW! GO!  What I had begun to think of as my watery grave soon come back into view. I looked hazily down, angled my self, and pushed with strength I was sure I didn’t have. I struggled, clawing at the water, clawing my way out of my grave. Light ahead. My mind fought itself for control of my body, I so wanted to give up, to end the agony that movement had become, but I wanted more to breathe. It grew steadily brighter, and I could see the image of my father’s legs moving back and forth as he wondered if I could hold my breath that long. I lunged forwards and upwards, clipping my head on a floating lane divider. What would later become a painful bruise went entirely unnoticed. Sweet life-giving air flooded back into my lungs. I felt as though my stomach had collapsed. I felt a lot of things, but most important was that I felt the shackles of gravity that once again embraced this fool and gave him back his life.

      Sleeping Awake By Max Willson  The following story is mostly true, but the title was blatantly plagiarized from a P.O.D. song and the story itself has been heavily dramatized, exaggerated, and generally jazzed up because I think it sounds better this way.  Besides, do you want truth or entertainment?  I thought so.              The beacon of human intelligence, it has guided us and has lit the path of mankind for ages.  It is the light that keeps us safe and warm, but light casts shadows.  Most people can ignore what lies in those shadows always walking on the well lit path, and some just don’t believe that the shadows are even there.  But I believe.  I believe with a fire that has threatened to consume me time and time again, and the fire must be fueled.             I had learned much.  I had learned to feel my own soul, I had learned to see from my third eye, and I had even learned to touch the currents of ethereal force; but it was never enough.  I had to have more.  I searched every source I could think of, wading through text after worthless text; trying to find a diamond in the shit.  Every book I read was useless, filled with half truths and lies made up to fill in those extra 200 pages.  Damn the person who thought of paying by the word.  I sought out others who shared my passion, but one person can only listen to so many crystal wavers, Neo-Satanists, hippie moon maidens, and yuppie fung shui masters unlocking their ultimate potential at Ikea before they lose all faith in humanity, and I hadn’t started out with much anyway.             I began to spend more and more time inside my own head.  I would walk long distances with my eyes closed; relying on my own extremely limited clairvoyant abilities.  I would completely shun my mundane studies; spending my time forcing images out of crystals, and tracing patterns in smoke.  The team effort of the uselessness of those around me and my own blatant lack of ability was deeply infuriating, something which only further hindered my focus.  I redoubled my efforts, whipping myself, pushing myself much farther than I should have.  The tension became too much for my mind.  I would never admit it to myself, but I could feel my sanity gradually slipping under the pressure.             I went off on another of my solitary walks.  I found myself gazing at the moon; it was full and high above me.  I was pushing my mind outwards, trying to sense my connection to the source.  I pushed myself harder, forcing myself out of my body.  My Chakras flared, my Parana flowed and somewhere in my mind a voice began to scream a cry of warning to those who have already damned themselves.  With steadfast arrogance and reckless power lust I ignored it, and pushed even harder.  The scream rose to a fevered pitch, quickly passed though howl, then wail, and soon put crescendo to shame.  This primeval roar from the depths of my fevered mind culminated in one note, one sound which pulled you back just long enough for you to see all the mistakes you had made, and then thrust you violently over the edge. Snap.             I passed the next block, walking into the nexus of 4 streets, and stood on the edge of the crossroads, watching in awe and horror as I walked to edge across from me, and the edge to my left, and the edge to my right.  My thoughts raced  what is this?  Your ultimate self is manifesting itself! No it’s not my ultimate self, my ultimate self is only one person.  But when you’ve pierced the seal you can bend the rules, so you could just bend the rule of singularity.  It they were me I could control them; we both know I’m trying and they don’t react. Wait, what’d he just say?   A familiar voice rolled forth.  My voice.             “We’re here to stop you Max.”             “You can’t keep doing this.”             “It’s going to kill you.”  My voice flowed again, but this time I was the one controlling it.             “What the hell are you guys talking about?”             “Your minds collapsing.”             “You can’t keep trying to reach for things that aren’t there”             “Accept it Max. It’s all a lie.”  My words were too much to accept.  I could refute them when anyone else said them, but if even I don’t have faith in my beliefs…  My mind lunged into excuses mode, seeking pretty words to pad my failing ego.    No, it can’t be.  They’re lying, this is some kind of trick another daemon, it can’t all be lies, I’ve got proof, and I’ve done these things.  The tarot couldn’t have just been a coincidence, I can feel it in my soul, I know it can be a lie.  It just can’t be.              “It is Max, Face it.”  Hah.  Hah!  Oh for the web we weave phantom max.  You’ve fallen into your own trap this time.  Those fools are even blinder than I.              “If it’s all a lie, then how did you know what I was thinking?  Seems to me your faith in psychics is pretty weak for a Mind Reader.”             “Come on Max your smarter than this, you should’ve figured this out by now.  We know your thoughts because they’re ours too, look at us!  We’re you!”   Fuck, I’m one clever son of a bitch.  Now how the hell am I gonna outsmart myself.              “Every plan you make we can see, have you truly already forgotten that we share your thoughts?”             “We’re trying to help you Max, your hallucinating”             “You’re drowning in your own illusions.”   Hallucinating?  What if they’re right, what if this has all been one big dream, one big lie?              “It is.  This is all just another dream.”   It’s a dream?              Something slid into position, and the magic switch clicked in my head.  This is a dream.  This is my dream.  This is  My World .  I has just seen the obvious answer and suddenly realized how stupid I was.  A happy, borderline giddy laugh bubbled up from within me.  It was a light, relieved, almost whimsical laugh.  When they spoke next a new note rang in their voice, it was the telltale wavering of uncertainty.             “What are you laughing at?”             “Can’t read my mind anymore, can you, FUCKER!”  Panic rushed across their faces.  I took control.  I spun down to face the one on my left, as my trenchcoat swirled I pulled from within a shotgun, double barrel.  Hey, it’s my dream, if I want there to be a shotgun there then by hell I’m putting one there.   Blam!  He collapsed as a perforated corpse.  I flipped the gun over my shoulder so that I was holding it upside down pointing it behind me.   Blam!   I didn’t even need to look to see if I had hit.  I’m not going to go through the trouble of materializing a shotgun that can miss, come on, that would be just stupid.  I stood up and walked slowly towards my remaining foe.  It was the slow steady walk of an action movie hero, flashy and dramatic.  I was really enjoying this now.  I flicked my weapon effortlessly; the barrel flew up, spun an impossible number of times and dropped perfectly onto my hand, snapping open as two more shells that were on my belt locked into place.  True, that was unnecessarily and almost disgustingly over dramatic, but I don’t get to walk around in a dream world where I'm an omnipotent force very often, and I’ve seen way to many Vin Diesel movies.  I held the gun forth along the length of my arm, pausing just long enough to perfectly relish my triumph.  The shot rang out into the night, and once again I was alone.   Ok, back to reality.  Do we have to? Yes. Damn.   I closed my eyes, and when I opened them I was still on the edge of that street, the moon hadn’t moved an inch.  Not a second had passed.  I kept walking, went home and never mentioned it to anyone.  All as though it had never happened, and in many ways it hadn’t

      I didn't write this one, but its a personal source of inspiration.  Do you remember?             Do you remember the sense of wonder at the vibrant colors of your early youth, when discovery still meant dabbing your fingers in the paint and spreading your vision across lines and pictures?             Do you remember the depth of your first love, the one you’d love forever, the one you’d always go back to?             Do you remember the fascination of the first movie you saw?  The first faerie tale you heard while being tucked into bed?             Do you remember all of these things?              Because somewhere, down inside of you, there’s a part of you that still yearns for them.  It’s the part that shivers with anticipation when you just know that something will never happen, yet you expect it anyway.  It’s the bit that gazes in wonder when you see something new and magnificent for the first time.  It’s where you go when start terror takes away your breath and makes you look inside yourself at the truth, too.             It’s not always comfortable or nice.  Sometimes it’s downright scary.  But it’s something bigger, something you can’t ignore; it touches something primal.  It’s in everyone, and that’s why we’re all part of it.             You probably go to a regular job, drive a somewhat used car and watch recycled sitcoms on TV.  You eat at fast-food restaurants or occasionally grab something at the grocery store.  Maybe your play some computer games, and you pay your taxes and have a driver’s license.             All in all, a very normal life.  Normal.  Boring.  Mundane.             So what’s the point?  Are you content to live as a slave to same culture and technology that’s perpetuated itself for a thousand years now?  Do you really find satisfaction in following all the laws, filling out all the forms, paying the same bills month to month and drowning in the stifling conformity and bureaucracy?             Oh.  You rooted for the underdog on Survivor.  You watched Babylon 5.  You read a couple Tolkien books.  Good for you.             What happened to the faerie tales and ghost stories?  Where did the sense of wonder go?  Did you ever even bother to look back and think, “Fuck, why is my life so goddamn pathetic?  How come there’s nothing special?  Why aren’t there any heroes any more?”  Or do you even care enough to think about it?  Are you so content that you’ll sit on your ass and not even wonder about it? Because there is something more.  Those people out there who believe in aliens, crystals, God, reincarnation, spirits, spells and spooks may be whacked, but they aren’t necessarily wrong.  What’s something you believed that you never told anyone?  Did you think you saw something not quite human out of the corner of your eye once?  Could you swear that sometimes you dream things and they just happen later?  Do you ever get that chill that just runs down your spine for no reason and turn around to see someone watching you?  Ever listen to some people talking and think how odd that they have voices just like your friends?  Did you look up at the stars and swear you saw something moving that wasn’t just a plane?  Yeah, everyone’s done it.  And you never tell anyone, because you’re afraid that it’ll sound stupid or crazy.  But it’s not.  It’s all true.              It’s time to break out of that shell of mediocrity.  The world bombards you with messages telling you about the horrors of starvation and barbarism, instructing you in how good your life is and how much better this modern age of technology is than the so-called “Dark Ages.”  What’s the point in a boring, semi-comfortable life of bleary oblivion?             Yes, There are risks.  There really are terrible things waiting in the shadows, read to eat you and turn your world on its head.  You also take a risk every time you cross the street, or get on an airplane, or go to the bank where a whacko with a gun might shoot you.  So what would you rather do – live and die in mediocrity, or take charge of your life, make your own decisions, decide on the risks you want, and see what the world really has to offer?             You never took that trip to Europe because you were afraid you couldn’t afford it.  You didn’t ask out that sweet little number at the bar, because you were afraid of rejection. You never tried that join your friends were passing around because you were afraid of getting caught or hooked.  Are you gonna go to your grave with the comment “Here lies a boring person who was afraid to live?”  Maybe you will.             But maybe you won’t.  Maybe, just maybe, you will find the courage to take that plunge and to do something a little differently.  Break a few rules, Walk on the edge.  Believe in something better than this gray homogenous crap that the world keeps trying to shovel at you.             That’s why we’re here.  We’ve taken that step, and we’ll help you to take it, too.  We don’t promise that it will be safe, comfortable or easy.  But if you make the most of it, it will be more than worth it.  Together with us, you can make the world something better.

       Ahh, to try this again. To lunge with all the exuberance of the fist time into keeping a log of my thoughts and signifigant encounters. At least this time I have  italics , live journal was killing me with their straight ASCI blogging. (sp. Bloging?)
