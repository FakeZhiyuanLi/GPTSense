      Kaden is 8.5 weeks old now.  He's smiling regularly and rolled over for the first time yesterday.  He had his 2 month check up today, the doctor said she was impressed by how alert and active he is.  She was amazed at how strong his is as well.  All is good on that end.  He weighs 12lbs 14oz, 24" long, and 15.5cm head circumference.  95%iles on height and weight, and his head is slightly larger than average. LMAO, I could have told you that giving birth!  That was the easy part of the day! hehe.  I got up late this morning, threw clothes on the boys and I, and shot out of the house to get Kaden to the Dr.  Welll...  I went to the wrong dr's office!!!  I drove all the way down to where the boys recieve their care only to find out that Tricare scheduled us up at Ft. Eustis!  HA!!  If I'd remembered that itty bitty detail, we would have had plenty of time to spare! lmao... boy I can be a ditz some days!!  Stress'll do that.  Speaking of stress.. we were supposed to get a phone call from the movers to confirm the dates of the move 10-14 days ahead of time.  No phone call.  We call the personnel office that handles the moves, they give us the number to the moving company... we call... They can't find us ANYWHERE in their system!! I knew it! I knew it!!  So we call the personnel office back, wait on hold for what seems to be forever, then they tell us it has all been taken care of and that we should be receiving a call soon...So yesterday (Thursday) there was no call yet.  We call personnel again, get the number to a Different company, call them... we had been booked just that morning!!!! WTF??? Good Grief!! Wonder what would have happened had there been no slots available for next week!  That would have been interesting... all our stuff, scheduled to turn in our keys on July 2nd...no one to lug our crap away...hmmmmmm.  We still haven't received a call yet from this new company like we were told we would, even the lady from it said someone would be calling us today.  Oh well, at least we know we're booked now.  We can't believe that we are down to less than a week before we move to California.  Reality still hasn't set in!  It will next week, that's for sure.  Went to run some errands today, all but one were fruitless.  Somebody is going around the E-6 parking lot and peeling off our military stickers.  We tried to get new ones, but couldn't find our proof of insurance.  We are insured, but can't figure out what happened to the papers. Doh!  Another place we went was closed.  And then we went to Lowes....  We go to get out of the car and Ethan is sitting the back seat crying saying he needs pants.  Of course Steve and I are like ??????  What do you mean PANTS??  The kid went potty earlier and didn't put his shorts back on!! LMAO  He wore a shirt that is a little bit too big on him and is the same color as the shorts, dark blue.. So racing out of the house earlier trying to get the errands done before the storm hits we didn't notice, or think to double check! Lesson learned!  Had some thunderstorms roll through the area this afternoon.  There was a tornado warning to the south of us and there are people calling the news station bitching at them because they cut into the SOAP OPERAS!  How stupid can you get???  It was funny though, the weather casters were actually having to tell the audience that it was necessary to cut into regular programming considering the dangerous nature of tornados and how they needed to get the warning out to the residents of those areas!

      Can you believe 6 weeks ago at 10:08pm tonight I pushed this beautiful little boy into this world??  He is such an awesome little guy!  I can't get over how drowned I am in these feelings of love and devotion to him.  But with Kaden is like WHAM and I'm knocked down by it again.  This is all awesome and am truly blessed to be experiencing the "perfect image of motherhood".. you know, the image of a breastfeeding mom in the rocker smiling down at her infant in radiant happiness... the one everyone says is a rare thing to happen... it happened to me!  Steve is going in to get his Vasectomy next Wednesday, June 16th at nearly the crack of dawn.  It's about time he got an appointment, after over a month of trying!!  I don't know how I feel about this whole thing, a part of me wants one more, but I never want to be on hormone BC again. Oh well, there's reversals right?  I think that's about it for the moment..

      YAY!  I got an online journal... I need an outlet, an outlet to celebrate in my own little corner, or to gripe in peace! (yea, like the INTERNET is peaceful!! lmao) Sheesh, where to start.. hmmm Ok, I was born and raised in California, but am now in Newport News, VA (since May '99)... BUT scheduled to move BACK to California over 4th of July weekend!!      Steve is in the Navy, currently the work schedule is nuts, so we are moving the family out to CA a few months early, so he can focus on getting what he needs done, so he can transfer off the ship and go be a recruiter for 3 years.  It was the ONLY way to get back to the west coast.  Why would we separate for 3 months like this?  We are very close as a couple and live in our own little world, it's a good thing when you want to spend all your time with your family... well, with his work, there is WAAAY to much stuff to get done, and with this comes a lot of stress.  With a new baby, we figured that since we are already going out in July, the boys and I would stay where I wouldn't would have some help (he'd hardly be home to help me if I needed it anyways).  Me...hmmm right now, I am a SAHM, but the worlds worst housekeeper, and the biggest procrastinator! hehe  I like that last minute motivation... aka panic mode!  Get the best work done that way!  I can't wait for the movers to come on June 30th and put ALL the stuff in boxes!!  HAHA, no house to clean for 3 months until we get a place in Victorville (where we think he will be recruiting). My hobbies are reading (when I have the time), music (I'd die if there wasn't music), drawing (I'm good but not great, I'd LOVE to take an art class, and learn to do computer graphics), stamp collecting (dorky-I know, I need to get all my stamps out of boxes and into albums) and some scrapbooking...I'd actually do my hobbies, if I had the time and a clean house! lmao  I am also a moderator on a message board.. mumsonthenet.co.uk  The girls there are all cool, and there are a whole bunch of us from all over the world..US, England, New Zealand, and I think Australia (??) We're all younger mommies for the most part, so it's nice having people you can relate to.  Owen... He's my firstborn, if that can be said for twins.  He's older by 13 minutes.  He is such a sweet sensitive boy, but still very boyish. He's the follower of the two, more quiet, shy, but not as shy as Ethan. He bumped his head on his bed last night and has this nasty shiner on his cheekbone... it looks soo painful.  Ethan... Mr. Activity, the instigator, is ALWAYS doing something!!He's pretty shy and also sweet.  I think he's gonna be a ladies man or something when he  grows up.. he already checks the girls out.  Kaden... He will be 6wks old tomorrow! Can you believe it??!?! He's the easiest baby ever!!  He's been sleeping through the night since he was a few days old.  How did we get so lucky to have such a wonderful little baby?  He started smiling about 2 weeks ago, the mimicking kind of smile, now I'm slowly seeing the "Hi Mommy!" recognition smiles.  I LOVE IT!  Daddy even got a smile last night, it made his day :)

      Wow! This past month has passed by insanely fast!  Kaden will be 14 weeks old tomorrow. He has rolled over a few more times, coos, and loves to laugh. He is such an active little man. We think he may be beginning to get some teeth in, drooling like mad, screaming when he thinks it's warranted. He's eating like a horse, and can take rice cereal like a pro. He is almost ready to get it regularly rather than as needed.  Owen and Ethan are doing well. Superly duperly active. Their speech has improved dramatically, hard to understand at times, but now speaking closer to their age levels. They love doing puzzles now, and are very quick to do them. Owen drew a firefighter the other day warranting a place in a scrapbook.  Dozer has turned into the picture perfect dog, so well behaved it's unimaginable. It is so nice having a dog that hardly is a problem. There has only been kleenex shredding incidents, no more chewing issues! It's great!!! Migo on the other hand is not doing so great. If I leave my parents house, they lock him in his kennel, and don't take them outside to pee, and if they take him out, they forget he is not potty pad trained, yet get mad when he pees on the floor. Is that really my fault? It used to be that he would have the occasional accident as any puppy would, but this is really messing stuff up.  Jason and Julie's wedding went off without a hitch. It was more stressful being on the sidelines than getting our own wedding together. But it was so beautiful. Outdoors on the patio and lawns of the Lake Natomas Inn. The weather was suprisingly beautiful (85 degrees) for the middle of July. At the reception, Ethan took advantage of the caterers pouring champagne for the toast... he came running up to our table, happy as can be, grabbed a glass, and before we had a chance to react, he drank it as if he was taking a shot of something. ugh!! I caught him doing it again, and tried to stop him, but didn't get to him time. Steve's step brother ended up with the mother of all hangovers... NEVER mix beer then liquor (never sicker!! lmao)  The Monday after the wedding we went up to Lake Tahoe to spend the week with Steve's mom, her husband, Mandy (Ron's adopted daughter/biological grand-daughter) and Kayla (Julie's little girl). We all had a great time. The boys got some pool time and I think will soon be comfortable enough with water to take swimming lessons. Jason and Julie came in Monday night, but we didn't see really until about Wednesday, when we took all the kids up to Squaw Valley to ride the gondola, and ice skate. They had a lot of fun, the boys didn't skate because it was so cold and windy. I didn't have as much fun, there is that little thing called "an issue with heights". Thursday, Steve and I took the boys up to Sand Harbor National Park on the Nevada side of Tahoe to let them swim and play. Friday, Steve and I went horseback riding and did an Emerald Bay dinner cruise. Then Saturday we went fishing with a charter boat and caught 3 Mackinaw trout.  Steve left that Monday to go back to "yucky old Virginia" as the boys call it. It was easier than expected, but I am still left wondering if we made the right choice. I miss him so dearly, but when he tells me of the crap going on on the ship, I am glad we are out here and not a distraction for him. 3 section duty and then the potential for port and starboard duty (every other day "work sleep overs")  OK, so the Saturday after he left, I drove up to Eagle Lake to go camping and see some family. The boys had a blast up there. They met a little boy that was the great grandson of my grandparents friends... Ethan Thomas, as they called him. They all played and played hard everyday. I caught a 4 pound rainbow trout up there, my mom caught 3, and Owen had one reeled up to the boat when the line broke... darned Scooby Doo poles! Apparently it was a good size. We all got tan as can be up there, even Kaden got some color, it's so cute having a little tan baby. All four of us have sun bleached blonde hair.  So we are back from there, and now considering moving down to Victorville early to get set up and house hunt. It's hard moving back in with your family when there are rules and such you are unaccustomed to. As well as having a family who is nowhere near used to little kids and the chaos that ensues. I love my family and appreciate that they have offered me a place to stay so we can save money, but I can't adjust, I feel like I need "my OWN space", if you know what I mean. Where the kids can make their own mess, and I can get online without feeling guilty.  Sooo.... off to check the rental market in the "high desert":D
