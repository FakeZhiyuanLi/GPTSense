      I have the worst headache ever. I have tried everything to get it to go away: aspirin, acupressure, sleep, fresh air, everything. The idea of thinking enough to be witty or even vaguely amusing is just too much effort but I am here any way. The wonderful think about touch-typing is that I am sitting here with my eyes closed and my head back but I still know what is going on the screen. You have to love that. You know I remember when it took me minutes to find an individual key on the keyboard now…. I don’t even look and I know when I’ve made a mistake and how many spaces I have to delete and I am still reasonably fast. Cool, huh?  Why I am I telling you this…most people who spend too much time on the computer can do this…occupational hazard. I will tell you it is not a practice that goes over well at work. For some odd reason they expect you to look like you’re working and not type with your eyes closed… My speed is the same and the words come from my brain not from my eyes so I say, “What does it matter?” I am trying to decide what to do this weekend. I have three choices. I could go in and do some MORE over time on Saturday, I could just stay home and kill time and maybe actually get some sleep…that would be good I am so not a morning person and I have to get up early to go to work, or I could go to California. San Diego, Long Beach and San Francisco are all possibilities. I could go to a Giants game, if they are home, visit family in Long Beach or just lie on a beach in San Diego. The major draw back with California is that I have to go to the airport and through security and I really hate that. I know why we do it and I am ok with it, I just don’t relish the thought. Oh well I will just have to deiced what to do later. I’m going to sleep this headache off and worry about the weekend later.

      OK my blog is being obnoxious tonight. For some odd reason I can’t scroll to the bottom and I can’t get the tag board on there to my satisfaction. Anyhow, I am just kind of killing time. I didn’t really sleep last night and when I was a sleep, I was having nightmares. The storm was fab and really REALLLY loud. We are talking car alarms going off loud. So does time really exist? I mean I wholly subscribe to the theory that time is an illusion and lunch time doubly so (thanks to the late Douglas Adams for this idea) and now I am wondering why I am staring at the clock waiting for 60 random seconds to tick by for no good reason. It occurs to me that the only reason we is obsessed by time is the mechanization of society and the industrial revolution. I before the industrial revolution people could tell time and knew what time it was but there was no push for 8 hour work days and time off and what time is it. Now we work by the clock we break by the clock and we go places by the clock. It is annoying. I want to just throw the clock and time out the window and do what I want to do when I want to do it. Eat when I’m hungry, work when I want and sleep when I’m tired, but I’d have to get the rest of society to do it to or I would just get my self tossed out into the hippy fringes. I don’t mind fringes, I’m not too big on belonging and I like hippies but I don’t want to be on the outside in the hippy fringes…  all thoes things together would be too much. So I’ll watch the clock and sulk. I hate time.

      Hmmmm….I really don’t have much to say tonight. Its all either boring, work related or…well something I’m just not going to share. Hey wow, it starting to rain (I think its hard to tell when I’m inside and its dark so I can’t see much out my window but I think it is raining…any way not important). If you want to read some of my work related stories check out the link to Flying the Silly Skies, I swear they are all true stories. Anyway… Wow! Now I am really fascinated by this storm. No lightening, bummer, but it is windy as all get out, my window is shaking and I can see the pine trees whipping about in the wind. It takes so little to fascinate me, it is kind of sad really. Maybe its like one of those Zen riddles… you know if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound? (Wow! Lighting! No thunder though.) It is supposed to get your mind in a state of readiness. Readiness for what I’d like to know. I think storms have that effect on me. If I just knew what I was getting ready for… Oh well… I think I’m just going to be fascinated by the storm for the rest of the night; I just need to pick some good music…

      Whoo! I added a counter to my blog here, and now I can see just how many people are not reading it. I used to be pretty good with HTML and some of it is coming back to me so I can play with this template a bit but I am afraid that I’m going to do something really stupid to it. Any way, today I’ve decided to rant about this whole music download thing. You see I think the music industry is just going about this the wrong way. Does it really do you any good to scare, threaten and alienate the very people you want to buy your product? I mean please! What about the good old days when people taped the songs they liked off the radio? Did these record company people try and shut down radio stations… did they try to track down everyone who bought blank audiocassettes? No, they didn’t and guess what people still bought tapes and cassettes. The radio is how you are noticed, you get on the air waives and people hear you and they buy you. The record companies need to realize that music has moved on to the web and that the net is now how you get noticed. People hear you they download you and they buy you. I for one hate to buy a CD based on one song I heard on the radio, I like to hear at least two before I buy and if the group doesn’t catch on well enough to get two singles out there… I don’t buy the CD and that’s the end of it. I’d rant some more but I have to go move the laundry and take a nap…or stare at the sunset, I haven’t decided which yet.

      Today, I got to thinking about this whole concept of blogging. I’ve decided it is all about voyeurism. Realistically we all think what we have to say is of some kind of importance or we wouldn’t say it and we all like to have people notice us. It’s a… even though I don’t really want some one out side to see me changing my cloths I don’t close the curtains every time sort of thing. We kind of want to know what is going on inside other people’s heads. Honestly, I don’t think any one could live in my head. What your reading here is a seriously minute portion of what goes though my head. For example today I was thinking about the fact that some one had to invent the paper clip, gram crackers had to be made, there are wild guppies, and that Pokémon, ATMs and Martha Stewart are responsible for the downfall of western civilization (I can explain my reasoning here if you want but you’ll have to ask). I don’t know if this sort of thing goes on in other people’s heads but I think about things like this (an stranger more complicated philosophical hypothetical stuff) ALL the time. These thoughts just kind of pop in my head, I play with them a while and they go away. I don’t usually share them with people but sometimes I think about them again. Any how… I hope your enjoying your little “Rear Window” (great movie by the way) view of me. I know that I am enjoying the little show I’m putting on and enjoy watching the shows other people are putting on in their blogs.

      OK my thoughts today have all centered around flying, freedom, the sky and escape. I have just started to figure out why and I’ll tell you. It started today at lunchtime… this is when I started to recognize the pattern. It was teriyaki day at work and after coming to the realization that not everyone cannot use chopsticks (I can but I didn’t realize not everyone could…go figure). I was eating lunch and I was staring at the clouds and there were about three running more or less parallel that looked like Chinese dragons and they kind of merged to become a Phoenix rising from the flames and as was staring at the sky watching the clouds it was all I could do to stay at work the rest of the day, I was ready to get in the truck and go to the airport and hope a plane to any where, it didn’t matter. California, Omaha, Greenland, Japan, any where, it didn’t matter as long as it wasn’t there. Later I heard one of my favorite songs “Blue” and I wanted to cry. That was the tip off. I didn’t hear “Blue” until the office was empty and I was just about all alone. I looked at the time and it was like… Whoa! What am I doing here still?!?! “Blue” is all about being free…I love this song to no end… and I have been pulling MAJOR over time. I mean I get there at 7am and go home any where between 6pm and 8pm. This is not healthy. As much as I like the paychecks…it is making me feel trapped and very unhappy. I’ve been pretty good this week only 9 and 10 hour days, no 12s, but this will be my third Saturday in a row. Now to make matters worse they are freezing the vacation bid…so I’m rather stuck. To hell with this….I’m going to go read. Maybe I can be free there and if you don’t hear from me tomorrow I gave up and got on the plane.

      My neighbors are out of town for a while so that means that I get to go swimming... I decided a long time ago I am too old to go to a public pool. Besides, it tends to be a big pain in the butt and a meat market type of atmosphere. But I do love to swim… its hard to get out of the water. I love the weightless feeling and how much more graceful and how much faster I am in the water. Yeah, I do the “adult” thing and I swim my laps and get my exercise but that just isn’t fun. I still like to do handstands, turn summersaults and dive, and just swim around under water. The last few nights it hasn’t been too stormy so I get to just swim for however long I like. If it was a full moon, I don’t think I’d ever get out of the pool. But since it isn’t I get out as it gets dark. I love to just float on my back and watch the sky change color as the sun sets. After all the pinks and reds fade the symphony of blue… that is the best the sky kind of layers itself from west to east from robin’s egg to midnight and watching that melodic transition stretch across the sky while the light fades and the cicadas sing and I just float is just about the most relaxing thing in the world.

      Bummer…that storm never shaped up last night. I though since there was no storm I would go rent something…something anime and I must admit to being very put out by what I discovered. I found out why people who watch anime tend to be broke…you HAVE to buy the stuff, you can’t rent it…it doesn’t exist in rental format! I have gone through the 4 best series ever (Kenshin, Eva, Hellsing and Cowboy Bebop just in case you wondered) and I have watch some of the best movies ever and I have bought all 4 series and most of the movies but I want to branch out see something new, I may love what I have but I can’t watch it for ever can I? Anyway…I had a list of 4 series I wanted to start and 3 or 4 movies I would like to see and they had NONE of it. 1st I had to spend 10 minutes trying to find the anime section buried at the back of the store and then it was SMALL…they had more Sailor Moon and Pokemon than real anime. What they had in was either old and cheesy or I had. How annoying is that? I even tried a 2nd store and it got worse…not better. To make matters worse Chicago isn’t out on DVD yet so I didn’t even have that to fall back on. I wound up coming home movie-less and watching Phone Booth again, great movie…just not what I wanted. So, if you want to contribute to my anime fund please send a check to…

      i've had it...i was trying to find a new free blog skin...template...what ever and they either are kind of ugly or can't be used with the free version of blogspot *shrugs* this template will just have to do... we have had some interesting storms rolling through here lately and i have been able to enjoy one of my more favored hobbies, lightening watching. its a great hobby it can be an exercise in patience with little electrical storms or just no storms at all, an exercise in nerves when the storm gets close and even inside the house is too close...it all depends on the storm. the last two storms have been...well good for me the first one on sunday was all about peace and beauty. the storm didn't start to blow in until about 11pm so instead of staying up reading i put on some good music (some toned down jazz...very relaxing) and stared out the window. it was really soothing to watch the trees outside my window swaying in the wind and watch the lightening move in...getting closer and closer the best thing was watching it reflected in my mirror. i fell asleep watching the storm it was great. last night was all about observation... i was sitting outside watching the storm saunter in from the east and the things that i heard and smelled... it was...will like a dream. i found out there is one air-conditioner in the neighborhood that never shuts off i could hear the crickets and the cicadas (i love cicadas) the stone wall i was lying on was still pretty hot...it was a good feeling...the air started out just smelling dry and hot but then you could smell freshly watered lawns...dust...the moister from the storm and my favorite the pungent bitter sweet smell of the creosote bushes from the desert reserve the way the light from cars street lights etc reflects in an over cast sky makes it a bright night and everything kind of glows... i love it. i think i was just sitting/lying outside for an hour or two...just watching and thinking. there are some storm clouds coming in again tonight, i'm kind of hoping for a repeat

      Ok this is my second start on this blogging thing...i was going to combine my random thoughts with my customer service horror stories but decided against it so i will now have 2 blogs (is any one else confused/does any one eles care) any way... for the record today i think i accomplished...hmmm....lets see NOTHING! i hate that. so i wind up listing to really loud music and bugging people on my way home (it may be 110+ but i drive with my windows open and the air off some how it just feels...right/better...that and its better for my gas milage) now i'm alternating between Linkin Park and Drowning Pool and some Stone Temple Pilots. some times i wonder what people think when they see me listing to/getting into this music i don't look like i should listen to this type of music. it doesn't really matter, i guess, i like it. enough rambling from me today...

      Someone called me “giddy” tonight. Ha! That is the best laugh I’ve had in a while. I don’t know one other person on the face of this earth that would use that word to describe me. Granted sometimes I can be a bit… enthusiastic … but that really isn’t me. See I got to thinking about this and decided that the reason he would pick that word to describe me is that he only sees me when I’m hanging out with his wife, she is probably the best friend I have, and we can get a bit silly… ok, ok we are almost always very silly when we are together. Only knowing me that way… yeah, I might pick the word “giddy” to describe me. The words: flip, unique, bizarre, aggressive, and different, have all been used to describe me by different people. However, the words: apathetic, depressed, angry, hostile, and laid-back, have been used to describe me too. Let’s just say that Shakespeare hit it on the head when he said, “All the world’s a stage. And all the men and women merely players.” I play to my audience. We all do. Either you create a person to be in a given situation or in given company or you fill a role that’s needed. I guess that is part of life in this mess we call civilization and part of that whole social contract that we all have with each other. I wish, sometimes, that I only had to deal with the me that other people know, that me is an ok person. The me I have to deal with most of the time is a bit of a mess. ~Shrugs~ what the hell, so I put up a façade 95% of the time… it doesn’t matter. I know who I am and as much as I’m not ok with that, I’m also ok with that. I don’t know how, nor do I really want to be anyone else.

      I’m debating whether or not I want to get up at about 2:30 tonight and go outside to see Mars. I have a pretty good telescope and it would be a cool thing to see but it is still 2:30 in the morning and I do have to go to work tomorrow. Besides, there is one hell of a storm out there and I might not be able to see Mars anyway. ~Shrugs~ we’ll see what happens… no promises. I don’t know why I’m telling you this now but I did something not this past weekend but the one before it that I think everyone should do at least once… if not once a year. I took a completely pointless, aimless, had no idea where I was going or when I was coming back road trip. Now part of the charm of this kind of trip is to do it by yourself… you know alone. It really gives you time to think… and time not to think. My problem is that it raised more questions than it answered, but we won’t go into that. You don’t really want to know and… more importantly… I don’t want to tell you. For the record, they were your standard life the universe and everything kind of questions. Anyhow, about noon on Friday, I got in my truck and all I knew was that I was going to drive for a while and that I didn’t want to go south. Next thing I know I’m on I-17 heading north (good thing too because 17 only goes north and south and I knew south didn’t interest me). I’m driving up the road kind of “la la la… I’m driving somewhere… la la la” and I’m wondering where I am and if my wimpy four cylinder truck can make the clime and wow should I stop at that casino or should I pull off and look at that National Monument. This whole trip was one long stream of consciousness… no punctuation and no direction at all. I see the exit for Sedona and decide what the hell I’ve never been to Sedona and pull off the 17. Sedona is OK I guess. It is quite beautiful really, but much too full of tourists, yuppies and hippies. I did, however, find some good tea (one of my pursuits in life is good tea). I got board with Sedona, picked a road at random, and wound up on this extremely pretty stretch of two lane highway 89A. It goes through this really neat canyon; kind of a high desert, green, some fair sized streams and very quite type of deal; like a post card really. While I was driving it was just barley drizzling and stopped at the top of the canyon and watched people throw Frisbees off the side. Environmentally that’s bad, but it looked so cool. Long story short, I wound up in Flagstaff bought some new books, played pool with my brother and had a few beers… it was a good trip. I might go west next time I do this though.

      Played cards tonight… cards are good but I’m never sure if it is a game or open warfare. Most of the time, it is a game but it can get hot, especially with all the Monday morning quarterbacking. I mean to say we’ll play one hand, six tricks, and two hands later someone will still be going over the would of, could of, should of for that hand. But still it is fun. It is a marvelously social game even with all the shouting and finger pointing, which is all in good fun. I will say however, there are folks who have run screaming into the night after playing cards with my family. We play a funny game. We play euchre but four-handed bid euchre. I’ve never met anyone outside of our family that plays it. I wrote a paper for an oral history class on this game. Part of the work I did for this paper was to research card games, specifically euchre. I’ve seen three handed four handed and five handed, I’ve seen high low, and I’ve seen bid games but all of them play with a kitty or some other variance. Our game is not recorded any where…just in the family and it is orally passed down from generation to generation. My father says (the game comes from his side of the family) that the game is the true test. Meaning if your going to make it in our family, if your going to marry in or something like that… you’ve got to learn to play, play well, argue about it and have fun with it. I guess it is true too. I mean Pop and Ma have been married 31 years… she plays. She didn’t when she first met Pop, but she plays now. The thing about that is that Ma taught her family… her parents and sisters how to play this game too. Now when we play cards on that side of the family we still play bid euchre. Sometimes with Ma’s family, it can be a different game but not usually and on Pop’s side NEVER. Because both sides of the family are from the Midwest, the games are always loud, long, hard and vicious. I don’t know why but Midwesterners are the meanest card players out there… I mean don’t sit down at the table unless you mean to play hard. Oh well, that is a topic for another time. I’m thinking I need a beer, a movie and sleep (a full gas tank couldn’t hurt either but if you think I’m going out looking for gas now… you are SO wrong).

      Hey…you! Yeah, you. What are you looking at? Never mind that was kind of rhetorical, besides I wouldn’t care about the answer anyway. Look at what ever you want makes no never mind to me. I have about five things I really should be doing but I don’t feel like any of them so I am ignoring them in the hopes they will go away. Just in case, you didn’t know, or that you cared, I live in Phoenix. Right now, Phoenix is in a bit of a gas crisis. Yes, you heard me gas, you know the stuff you put in your car to make it go. A pipeline between here and Tucson broke and they haven’t been able to get the stuff up to Maricopa County like they usually can. There are more stations without gas than with gas and there have been lines an hour plus long to fill up. It is getting a bit better now though. What this means I that even though I drive a wimpy four cylinder truck I have not been going any where but too and from work. I mean I haven’t even gone to the grocery store that is only a mile away… maybe less.  So I am starting to go a bit stir crazy. The net is starting to bore me, I’ve watch most of my movies and my books are irritating me. This is truly sad. I love my books…so many good books, so little time. But, when I feel cooped up and restless I cannot concentrate. God, get me out of here! Its funny, when I can go somewhere with out worrying or thinking about it I usually stay home, but now that I can't, I need to get out, somewhere, anywhere. I’m starting to try for my natural escape… sleep. When I want out or am board or depressed I either sleep or stay up all night. Lately, I’ve been gunning for sleep. Unfortunately, This doesn’t work well with your standard 8 AM to 5 PM workday… I can’t sleep in and if I take a nap too late in the day I’m up all night, and usless the next day (not that you can always tell the differance) see a vicious cycle. I’m tired, I’m bored, I can’t sleep and I’ve been stuck in the house for four days now. I wonder if this is how Emily Dickinson got her start?

      “It is better to reign in hell that to serve in heaven.” (That quote is from Paradise Lost by John Milton in case you didn’t know.) So, is this a true statement or a false statement? Want to know my favorite answer on any “True or False” test? You do! … 'Maybe'. Just for the record, I really did take a couple of T&Fs and answer 'maybe' all the way down the page (I can get you in touch with my teachers if you don’t believe me) I thought I would at least get half credit; never really worked out that way. Anyhow, back to Milton and reining in hell and serving in heaven. Truth of the matter is it does depend. I know people who (regardless of religious considerations) would rather serve, would rather have direction… something to believe in, something to follow. Some days this seems like a good idea, even to me, but some days there would be no way I could take it. I’m not big on the idea of ALWAYS bowing, ALWAYS following and ALWAYS yielding. Granted some days I don’t want to think and serving is better, but that gets old really fast. Let me out, let me think, let me do! Why should I follow someone else’s dreams, their path? Mind you, I have no qualms about helping someone on their path and if we both have the same goal, or at least are moving in the same direction co-operation is great! Yes, let’s work together, two heads are better than one; all for one, one for all and three for a dollar and all that good jazz. However, for me to be happy, give me my head, my freedom and let me work according to my myself, my heart and my mind etc. etc. etc. The most wonderful place in the world can be a prison if there is no freedom and the most horrible place in the world can be paradise, if I am free. So all things considered, and regardless of the reality or fiction of heaven or hell… I’d rather reign in hell than serve in heaven (or any where else for that matter.)

      I had a topic for today’s entry… and then I didn’t. Then I decided I didn’t care and would write something amusing in its randomness and completely incoherent. Then I rediscovered the evils of call waiting. I HATE call waiting. The concept is OK, I guess. But the actual use/execution is horrid. Why the hell did you call me if someone else is more important? If you don’t want to talk to me; that’s fine by me. If you are waiting for a call great, call me later or tell me to call you later.  If I’ve called you at a bad time or your waiting for someone else, tell me! I’ll call back. I have a phone, I’m a person I’ve been in this type of situation myself. Now is not always a good time. Let me know when it is. I rabidly detest call waiting. I will tolerate it from some people, but only people who use it justifiably and judiciously. If you just need to check something or your going to tell the other party you’ll call them right back… fine. I mean there isn’t even any hold music! How are you supposed to know if you’re even still connected? Leave me in phone line limbo for more that 90 seconds and I don’t care if you are my mother, best friend, the pope or even some kind of Supreme Being… I reserve the right to hang up. I’ve been left on call wait for so long that the other party has forgotten I was waiting, for so long I forgot I who I was talking to, for so long that my phone battery has died and long enough to have a pizza delivered. For a while, I thought that call waiting was some kind of karma pay back… I was evil in a past life and now I must wait in phone line limbo until I can reach the next plane. I have since decided that I was not THAT evil in a past life, no one is evil enough to be continuously stuck in call wait. I do, however, believe that the person responsible for the invention of call wait will come back in their next life as some one stuck in a perpetual DMV and or post office line.

      I’ve said before and will say again that ATMs, Martha Stewart, and Pokemon are leading to the downfall of civilization, well at least American/western civilization. Although now that I think about it I’m not sure how much of a hit Martha Stewart is in Western Europe… so maybe I will only blame them for the downfall of American civilization. Tonight I have decided to elaborate on my grudge against ATMs. I will cover the others later. ATMs and their offspring (check cards debit cards etc.) are single handedly destroying the credit ratings of the American public. They are doing this in two ways. First, they provide fare too much ease of access to one’s money (or lack there of). Any time you want to buy something just swipe the card…it isn’t real money, after all nothing left my wallet. So what if it is real money? I can wait to deal with it at the end of the month. This leads to a wonderful number of overdrawn accounts, bounced checks and arguments with the bank (I have seen this happen…not to me thank heavens I am WAY too cheap to get caught by that. I just never buy anything; I mean you’ll notice that I am using the FREE blogging software.) This leads to a fantastic amount of debit low credit scores and far to many bad infomercials on how to reduce your debt etc. This also means that there is nothing good on TV on Saturday mornings, because it is all infomercials. Now, my more particular grudge with ATMs is that they all dispense twenty-dollar bills. What if I don’t want to withdraw in increments of $20? Hmmm, ever think of that? The other thing is that you, me, and every one else uses ATMs so every one who pays in cash uses $20s. This of course means I can’t get anything out of the vending machine (they don’t take $20s). Moreover, just try being the third person in line at any fast food restaurant during the lunch rush. It is near impossible to get change! (This of course leads in turn to the use of check/debit and credit cards; it is a perfectly vicious cycle, isn’t it?) This means that I either have to skip lunch, pack it, or beat my way to the front of a crowd of hungry middle management twits. Mind you, I don’t mind beating up on middle management twits, but it isn’t the sort of behavior that gets you asked back, and there are only so many places to eat near my office. So I say, “Down with ATMs!” Or, at least let them dispense ten-dollar bills and vending machines should take pennies… but I’ll cover that later.

      I’ve been thinking about this off and on for a while now… Can there be a world with no religion? My answer right now is that this world cannot exist with out religion, no matter what kind/which one. This world has existed with religion as a motivating factor for many things for far too long; it can’t/won’t just go away. Good, bad or indifferent there will always be some form of religion here on earth. Could humans colonize another planet and develop a civilization with our religion? Possibly. You would have to colonize this planet with agnostics and people who just don’t care one way or another about conventional religion; I even think that atheism would lead to some kind of religion. While and atheist might not believe in any kind of supreme being, it is possible that they would turn something else into a religion looking for something to believe in. Mind you, agnostics would pose a problem too, but as long as they aren’t trying to find “the answer”, it shouldn’t be a problem. Of course, this though also leads one to question what religion is any way. You’d think after going to Catholic school for nine years, I would have a better handle on this question, but I’m really not sure. Most people have a personal religion that doesn’t have anything to do with any kind of deity or church. You might not even realize that you are practicing this personal religion. Maybe you do go to church and follow all the teachings they give you. Maybe you practice those teachings outside of a church setting and maybe you even believe them. This doesn’t stop you from having something else that you work for and believe in, even if it is your family. We all have a less spiritual religion that we follow; maybe it is work, family, or education. We all have a secondary religion in us even if we don’t know it or want to admit it. Since we all follow this personal religion, whether we know it or not, I don’t think that there will ever be a place with out religion. Might there be a place with out a conventional religion, with out a religion that surrenders too and embraces a higher power? Yeah, I’ll say that is a possibility but I think it is human nature to believe in something, or to try and find and answers for things and I think that that search constitutes a religion. It may be a religion of one, and it might not get you a tax break, but it is still a religion.

      OK…I was mentally composing some blog entries today at random points through out the day. Honestly, I have no desire to record my every day activities. Why would I want to relive them? I’ve already done it once why should I care about them again and why the hell would you want to read about them any way? So, I’ve decided tonight to ramble about the possibilities of alien life in the universe. There are basically two schools of thought. There is the Contact school with “it would be a terrible waste of space” if there wasn’t other intelligent life in the universe. There is also The Hitchhiker’s Guide school with the concept of, there are an infinite number of planets in the universe and a finite number of them are inhabited. But, any time you divide a finite number by an infinite number the resulting number is so small as to not matter any way (also known as zero). This makes any one you’ve ever met a figment of your imagination. In I really don’t buy into the waste of space concept. I figure that life (you’ll notice I am reserving judgment on intelligent life) is all just an illusion. None of this is real and that everything is a figment of someone’s imagination. My only problem here is… whose imagination? If I don’t exist, you don’t exist and no one I’ve ever met or even seen exists who’s messed up illusion is this? Out of vanity, I would say it is my illusion and that I have created this whole world to suite my own purposes but that doesn’t seem right. I really don’t believe that at all. I suppose it could all be a dream and that I am really someone else in some other world…some other dimension asleep and just dreaming all of this but you would think there would be a hole somewhere. It feels like I should be able to step out of this world…this life. I should be able to find the edge and see nothing in front of me but a black field or a blue screen. I really don’t buy that answer either. I think this is some one else messing with us all, providing we exist at all, which I’m not sure we do. Wow, I’ve gotten off topic from aliens haven’t I? Hmmm…back to the aliens and a quick summation. There is no alien life in this universe except for the ones that tried to abduct me about eight years ago…but that might have been a dream too.

      That damned headache is back again. You know, the one that hits right behind our eyes and makes you feel sick to your stomach. Oh well, what are you going to do. They are painting the house and so there is paper over all the windows, which makes for a pretty miserable environment. I don’t care if the air is on…it makes it hotter and messes with the light something fierce and that makes me irritable…I feel confined and I really REALLY hate that. But since they are painting the outside, at least you don’t get that evil paint smell. We did this team-building thing at work today and I am always suspicious of those. They are usually fun the only question is how well they work in the long run. Part of what we did today was to look at our different communication styles. They have this test and chart to determine if you are a peacock, dolphin, owl or a panther. Well apparently it was obvious to every one but me that I am a panther/owl…what this apparently means is that I am analytical and detail oriented as my secondary communication style, an owl. However, most of the time I am a panther, which translates loosely to pushy as all hell. No really, it means I am a “Command Specialist” strong willed, independent, practical, decisive, and efficient as well as pushy, severe, tough dominating and harsh. Makes me sound really friendly doesn’t it? Oh well… It does seem to have the added advantage of intimidating some people (that wasn’t in our hand out…it is just a personal observation). While I’m not out to intimidate people, it also seems to mean that I can hold my own…I like that. I’ve always know that I can hold my own in any situation but it is good to know it shows. ~Shrugs~ yeah… its good. I’m going to take a nap.

      Have you ever analyzed a stream of consciousness? I mean it is so weird. I called a friend tonight and we started out talking about her dead car battery, then on line quiz results, then cartoon dollz, then various problems with the Catholic church (before you get all high and mighty I am Catholic) then cemetery plots for sale, then my going back to school and then the fact that I don’t sleep much. The thing is that all of these were perfectly logical transitions and there were no really topic jumps…it all kind of blended.  Of course, on my own I can get from thinking about the Tutors’ (Henry VIII and all six of his wives and the various successions to the throne after his death) to questioning whether time exists or not (it doesn’t if you want my opinion) to wondering what cartoon I should watch or maybe I should just read a book. It throws me that this is all one train of thought. The way I look at it I never switched gears…it all blends it is all really just one thought. It is kind of like that show they had on PBS, “Connections”. Everything is linked from what music I’m listening to right now (the song is called Diggin’ just in case you wondered) to my unopened bank statement (which scares me) to the fact that I need to go and get some more ice water because I’m thirsty. How it works in this case is I can’t open my bank statement until this song is over (its too good to think about something else) and since I’m listening to the music I should at least write something and as I am typing I am looking at my glass of water, which is empty, and thinking how thirsty I am but I can’t go get some more water until this song is over but then I’ll have to open my bank statements so maybe I’ll put in a different CD so I don’t have to think about the bank statement for a while yet. And hey, is X-Men or the Simpsons on? Maybe I’ll go watch that and stop thinking about all of this…

      Ok my wonderful fantasy of getting on a plane and going to California almost happened but not quite… I am just feeling so lazy (and I really ought to go into work again). I’m talking putting on my PJs is too much work lazy. This is a massive step up from the monumental depression I was feeling earlier today but I guess you can suppress anything if you put your mind to it so I am back to my apathetic self. I friend of mine from work won a trip to Chicago, plane tickets, hotel etc., and tickets to three D-Back at Cubs games. I am SO green with envy it isn’t even funny. I like the D-Backs but the Cubs are my first love and you can’t pry me out of Wrigley Field, the first time I went there I started crying it was so perfect. Oh well, so I am stuck in my rut, my sad little world, and I care and I want to change but at the same time…why? This rut, this world, has worked for a while might as well stick to it, except I think it is driving me mad. **Shrugs** It doesn’t really matter, very few things do… I’ve got this new resolution on my monitor and if I keep it this way I will have to start wearing my glasses to work on the computer, I don’t want to do that. Mind you, I look good in my glasses; I just don’t like wearing them all the time. **Yawn** I think maybe I’m tired, which is a nice change of pace, usually I’m just board, but I don’t really want to go to bed…way too early. I think I’m going to have a Silver and watch one of my favorite movies for the, well I think it is the, 10th time. I’ve had to explain this movie to far too many people so I’m not telling YOU what it is but if you look at the address and the title of this blog, you might be able to make an educated guess. I saw it four times in the theater and got such grief for it. It was only in one theater in the state so every one knew what I was going to see… Anyhow, back to my rut…my pathetic little dream world. Maybe I can sleep through the whole weekend; that would be nice.

      Blah…. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Ok, now that you know how I really feel… I’m just tired. I want to post a good entry but I just don’t feel like thinking. I keep having this recurring fantasy of withdrawing all my savings and taking my passport and drifting from country to country… just staying there until my visa runs out and I have to leave. Ha! Like that would ever happen. Let’s face it; responsibility sucks. All these obligations, all these rules, and that annoying social contract; they make life pretty miserable. I wonder if there is a way to start over? People, philosophers, thinkers, and deeper people than me have tried to find a way to create a Utopia. I think you might be able to do it but we are talking about me taking over an island somewhere and creating an invitation only society. You can come in if I ask you and you will be thrown out when you violate the rules. We’ll have this great legal system, you get a verbal warning, then a written warning, and then we kill you… or at least throw you out. Of course, I would have to be the ultimate authority. I’m not talking about a monarchy or a class of nobility and other people to support me and the rest of the upper crust… I’m talking about me being the ultimate authority. I make the decisions, or at least decide who makes the decisions. I have no intention of sitting on a throne and reining. I have every intention of being in the trenches administering and working just like every one else. Mind you to truly create a Utopia I don’t think you can have more that 100 or 200 people, 300 tops. You have to be able to know every one at least by sight. Smaller would be better because then you would know more people and would be able to trust them. Or at least know that the community is so small that they really can’t step to far out of line because everyone will know. Of course, that “kill ‘em” portion of the legal system would be quite a deterrent as well. The whole thing about a Utopia is that when you go to start one you can’t let just any one in. I know that sounds elitists, but it is true. I would have to be pretty restrictive to begin with, so that people can work together and get things moving. Then you also cannot allow any loyalties to form within the society that might be greater than the society. You would have to completely change the definition of family for a start. By the time your done with this you have a comply alien culture one that most people won’t be able to relate to in the slightest. Since no one can relate to the Utopia, the members of the Utopia are alien, as aliens they are a threat, as a threat they must be destroyed, because we fear what we do not understand and we tend to destroy what we fear. Ok… with this in mind tonight I will NOT be forming a Utopian society. I will be having a Silver, staying up too late and then sleeping in… very, very late tomorrow.

      I’ve decided to give up thinking… I just come up with too many odd ideas. I’ve decided that “I think therefore I am” is rubbish. (Sorry Descartes but not everyone is going to agree with you.) I’ve decided that reincarnation, purgatory, nirvana and heaven are all perfectly compatible ideas and that I have far too many bad habits. Mind you most of them are under control… only raising their ugly heads once in a while but still…) I was just about to kill someone I couldn’t get my tea open and how the hell am I supposed to have a cup if I can’t get at the leaves? I had some whole leaf green tea earlier today and it was OK… not the best green I’ve ever had but not bad. I’m trying a Jasmine tea tonight… I hope its good. Mind you, my favorites are Green, Darjeeling, Earl Grey and Oolong (not that I can spell Oolong but it is still great tea). For all my obsession about tea, I’m not British or anything, just a tea freak. Oh well.  Funny this entry didn’t start to be about tea but that is kind of the way it is going… time to put a stop to that right now. I think I’m going to go to Ireland this fall. I’ve never been… I’ve been to Canada once, so I have been out of the country but this will be big time. I have to find a good tour (I’ll be damned if I’m getting an international driver’s license. No thank you I can get killed quite easily enough right here in the states where I know most of the rules, and don’t have to worry about which side of the road to drive on.) I am so tired lately… I think it is because I’m board. Funny thing is I’ve been getting out more than I usually do; a party here and there, shooting a lot of pool, shopping, hair cuts, and general carousing but I’m still board. I’m not all that old and so much of life seems so predictable. All the more reason for me to leave the country for a while. Oh, that Jasmine tea is good… it smells great, there are Jasmine flowers in with the tealeaves, but the taste is really quite good. It actually reminds me quite a bit of Darjeeling but a bit milder. I’m supposed to help make 300 to 500 site favors this weekend for an SCA event (if you don’t know what that is go to http://www.SCA.org and take a look it is faster than my trying to explain it). The idea of making all those site favors (they are like tags to show you’ve paid for entry) does not appeal to me, but I will be helping probably my closest friend in the world and that promises to be fun… I’m not sure how much we will get done (we tend to be rather silly together) but still, the two balance each other out. Anyhow, this entry didn’t turn out at ALL as I planed, so I am going to finish my tea and probably my book too. I’m reading Speaker for the Dead, which is surprisingly good. I loved Ender’s Game, Ender’s Shadow, Children of the Hemgon, and all the books about the kids from the battle school but never wanted to deal with Ender as an adult… boy was I wrong. My tea is getting cold so I’m out of here.

      I know that lately I’ve been attempting to have a theme or at least a topic when I write. It gives me some focus and it’s a good exercise. I used to be a half way decent author; I even had one professor who thought I was publishable not so long ago. Now my problem is my lack of focus. I keep wanting to do about eight things at once and so I wind up doing nothing. Well not nothing, but not any thing productive. Maybe if I had more drive… more discipline but what’s the point. I really don’t thing that you can get very far in this life and even if you do, what’s the point. (Yes, I understand this is a depressing entry but that’s where I’m at right now.) There are days I think I could drop out of site forever and completely and no one would notice very long. Someday, I might do that. Just say “to hell with everything” and drive away, start over. It might be fun. I don’t think there is a lot to keep me where I am. No, I’m not suicidal. Quite frankly, suicide is a coward’s way out and I don’t have much sympathy for anyone who takes it… I feel for the survivors but not the victim. Dropping everything and starting over wouldn’t be too hard, but not being me would be hard. I’ve tried a number of times to create a new persona to be… well to be someone other than who I am and it isn’t something you can maintain for long; who you are all ways comes out. Granted who I am has changed over the years but you always are who you are… and if your not, you’re no one. That is another coward’s way out. To hide behind a persona and always be someone you’re not. Oh, I’m not saying I’m not a coward I have my walls, my defenses and my ways of hiding, but they are my faults to deal with… criticize if you want but I don’t really care what you have to say. That is part of who I am. ~Shrugs~ enough of this self-serving pesudo angst ridden entry. Just because I am not a particularly happy person is no reason to whine about it; just deal with it. The same goes for the rest of you out there. Take responsibility for yourself. Don’t blame your feelings… you life on anyone, coward, deal with it.  No one owes you, no ones to blame Simple bad genes or DNA Ask your conscious the why and how Do it then, do it when, but do it now ~Yoko Kanno    Ask DNA   (And if that doesn't tip you of to one of my major obsessions in life, you're not nearly as cool as I thought.)

      OK…  an uneducated layman’s thoughts on string theory. The strings don’t have a shape and you are not trying to unite the strong molecular force with the weak with electro magnetism with gravity you are really attempting to unite energy and matter. Energy is the only thing that really exists at all and by changing the shape of the dimension(s), energy is forced into what we see as matter and CREATS all the other forces. So you see, your not trying to unite the four forces, you are looking for the point that they all ORIGINATE because they are intrinsically tied to each other.  Can you tell I just finished watching NOVA? I have a liberal arts degree, what do I know about physics? I’ve always loved sience and I understood how physics worked but never could get my mind ‘round the mathematics so I went with history, my other love. Anyhow, if I were a physicist… that is how I would be looking at string theory.

      I hate goats. Just think about that for a second. I really hate goats and superstitions and everything that goes with it. I also think that foul balls and long balls are meant to be caught. Caught by a player in the field or by a fan in the stands… you catch the ball. That is how the game is played. So, I’m a bit on the miserable side right now. I mean how to you go up 3 games to 1 and then throw it away, especially on your home turf? On the upside of live I won’t have to spend $200+ on series tickets or $200-$600 on a plane ticket to Chicago, but that is kind of a downside too isn’t it? I’ve been a fan of the northsiders since I fell in love with baseball. I remember when Sammy couldn’t hit at all. Some days I would only want to watch the 7th because the only thing I really cared about was Harry Carey singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game”. I learned the game watching Gracie on 1st and Rino on 2nd. I fell in love with the greatest sport ever because of these guys (Gracie in particular). I’ve watched Kerry Wood’s 20 K game, in it entirety, 4 maybe 5 times (thanks to rain delays and ESPN classic). I cried the 1st time I set foot in Wrigley Field, people had to ask me to move because all I could do was stare. I was so perfect; so green, so sunny, so very real but so very like a dream. It turned out to be so very cold (even in August too, especially with the wind coming in off the lake). I cut classes in college to watch them take a run at the playoffs and be shot right down. They are baseball to me and to many people. It is really quite sad. Maybe I’ve been one of the true fans, maybe for too long, because through out the whole game… the whole series… my motto has been… “It could happen!” now that it hasn’t I’ve already switch back the old stand by… “Wait till next year!”

      Ok here it goes… I know this is kind of creepy but I have been thinking about my funeral. No, I’m not dying or planning on it any time soon but if this is the last big bash I’m going to, I’d like it done right. I really only have a few requests. One is an old Irish tradition, a drink for the living a toast to the dead. This obligates everyone to have at least two shots, preferably more. I highly encourage everyone at my funeral to get smashing drunk (after the service). Of course that means I really should have my funeral on a weekend so everyone can nurse their hangovers the next day. The drinks should be hard (no paper umbrella froo froo drinks), good (no cheap paper bag whiskey for my mourners) and free flowing. I guess this means that I am also having cabs and other designated drivers on call. I have to be responsible about all these drunken people. There should also be a lot of good food and fun music, nothing sad or sappy. Music that I liked and it should be loud. I’m dead, so what? It is a good excuse for a party. The service is self should be simple and short… the party is the focus. As far as the service goes, all I really care about is two things. At the beginning of the service, I want “Spirit in the Sky” played loudly. At the end, just before everyone heads for the party, I want “Blue” played, on an excellent sound system even louder than “Spirit in the Sky”. (These two songs can be played again at the party to follow. When the hall or whatever this is being held at closes and people are leaving “Blue” should be playing.) The only other thing I care about is that I am cremated and scattered somewhere. Anywhere will do for me I’m not too particular (I am dead after all). As long as I am on the subject… when it is my time to go, let me go. No extreme measures… if I’m not coming all the way back (mind and body both fully and independently functioning) I want to go. The end comes eventually for all of us and I’d like to go with some semblance of the grace with which I have failed to live my life. They say that everyone should put this type of request down in writing somewhere. Well, now I’ve done that. Not that I’m sure what good it will do. I don’t think my family reads my blog all that much (even if they know it exists). Oh well. I can always haunt them if they screw up.

      First… I feel the need to vent massive computer related frustrations. ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE TECHNOLOGY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thank you for that minor indulgence… now on to my topic this evening. I was at work the other day and noticed that the toilet paper dispensers in the restroom had instructions on them. Not only were there instructions the instructions were in English, French and Spanish. This raised a few questions with me. One, what if the person using that toilet paper dispenser could not read English, French or Spanish? Hmmm? What then? We make them guess how to use this complicated piece of equipment? Then I got to thinking… these instructions don’t tell you what to do with the toilet paper once you have managed to get it off the roll. It doesn’t tell you what or how to wipe, or what to do with the paper after you use it. I say, damn it, that if you are going to give people instructions you finish what you start! Give them ALL the info. Incomplete instructions cause more trouble in the world. They leave far too much open for interpretation and guess work.

      Did I mention that I absolutely HATE technology some days? I computer has been on the blink for I don’t even know how long… anyhow it is sorted out now and that is good. Well mostly sorted out. I completely lost my e-mails… any thing I’d saved my entire address book etc. I am not happy. And now I am having massive issues trying to publish my web site. *Grumble* But let’s see… on the positive side I just recently got back from England… far, FAR too much fun. What can I say about England… 1) Aside from diamonds, pubs are a girl’s best friend. 2) A great thinker once said… “This is real mystic and all, but do you have anything to eat around here.” This phrase applies quite nicely to Stone Henge. 3) Tea time, especially the clotted cream, ROCKS! Some day I’ll have to write down all my adventures in London… OK well most of them. I have also discovered Plum wine… Plum wine also ROCKS.  I’ve also discovered that if you watch the Lord of the Rings ten minutes at a time, it takes like a month to finish the damn movie… I will be re-thinking my approach to this movie. Work has been incredibly slow and I am getting board, restless and vaguely hostile. Mind you the hostility is not directed to my co-workers but… oh some one has to die. Today was not pretty… I was supposed to go to fighter practice, its court night for the barony, but by the time I got home I was in such a miserable mood that the first person to speak to me was going to wind up in serious pain or dead and I really didn’t care which. On that note, I have discovered that while I really dislike being interrupted, phone calls etc., while I am eating and I dislike it while I am watching anime… to interrupt me while I am eating and watching anime (esp. my FAVORITE series ever… you have to guess which is my fave) should be punishable by death. Anyhow… I am out of plum wine… so I’m gone.

      Sorry I haven’t written in a while, not that I imagine that too many people read this… but still. It isn’t like nothing has happened in a while… plenty of things have. Maybe its sensory overload and I couldn’t clear my head well enough to put pen to paper… not that a pen or paper is involved in this process. I’ve been to London and back, my first time abroad. It was fabulous aside from the part where my camera broke, but hey I got over it. I should write about that… and I will, just not today. We did the whole Christmas thing… nice, if subdued. One of our dogs died, not unexpected. I’ve also applied for two different jobs in my department. I didn’t get the one but haven’t heard about the most recent yet… we’ll just have to wait and see. Today I what I have discovered is the true meaning of the phrase “bird brain”. I feed the birds in the backyard and was watching them. Its actually quite relaxing, if I don’t move they just go about there business, maybe a hundred of them, doves, sparrows, mockingbirds and the like. If I move one little inch… they are all gone. I love the sound their wings make when the whole flock lifts off at once… its soft and strong at the same time. But watching them I realize it is a serious group mentality. Obviously not all these birds can see me move but if one sees me move and takes off, another and another and another will trust there is some kind of danger and flee. I suppose if you are a prey animal that is the best way to live your life. It’s easier to come back if you’re wrong than get out of trouble if everyone else is right. So how come people do the same thing? Now granted, if we were in a forest, unarmed relying just on our wits to save us (well first off, there wouldn’t be many of us left) we are not that high on the food chain. We aren’t that strong, we don’t have claws or strong teeth and we’re not that fast. In fact as an animal, humans don’t have a lot to recommend us. But in the urban jungles, and their lesser cousins the suburban savannahs, where our species lives most of its life, we are the top of the food chain, nothing touches us. In fact, thanks to the technology we gained in the civilized wilderness, even in the real wilds of the earth, if we have guns, knives, and other weapons… its hard for an animal to get the drop on us. But we, well most of us, still behave like birds and trust the reaction of one person/group as being a true representation of danger, or of what we should be doing. How stupid is that! I mean here we are, a thinking animal and we still trust our instincts and flock together. It’s a good thing some of us don’t cling to the group or we’d still be in caves. For example, go to a ball game, or any large event. When people are leaving, one person will open one door, there is an equally good door next to it, but because no one has opened it before you get there it will still be closed, even though it means you could get out faster, most people wait on the first door. Excuse me while I hit my head on my desk… better. It is just so stupid, so obvious that I have trouble understanding it.

      It rained today… a lot. If you’ve read any of this blog before you know I am a big fan of the rain. I had played some pool and had some pizza after work today and while I was eating my pizza it started to rain. It didn’t want to stop and I wasn’t sitting in Peter Piper any longer than I had to, but I was wearing sued boots. Hmmm… let’s see do I sit in a pizza join and be board or ruin my boots. No not me I took option number three! I took off my boots and socks stuff them in my purse and walk the 100 yards or so to my truck bare foot! Then I have to sit in the truck with the windows steaming up and put my shoes back on to drive home! HA! The best part is that I got rained on at work today already. I had gone out for my morning walk, I might add in my sneakers (I keep a pair at work for my breaks) I was on the far side of the building… as far away from my desk as I could get and it starts to pour. I am literally three tenths of a mile from my office at this point. By the time I got back my pants were soaked, my shirt had to be wrung out, my hair was plastered to my head, and I was freezing! I might add my director found this all very funny… I did look a bit like I fell in a swimming pool so it is amusing in retrospect. I had to take my shirt off and wear the cardigan I keep in my cube with out anything under it and my fuzzy slippers, borrow a heater from one of the other agents (some people keep small heaters in their cubes… it gets cold in our building) and find some hair spray after my hair finally dried… It is a REALLY good thing I like the rain.

      Right, I just finished reading someone else’s blog and so now I feel like a total slacker for never updating mine. To that I say “Nuts to you!” Actually what it is, is I have been totally addicted to my first PR forum and that has been satisfying, or at least keeping in check, my need to be an author. Although I will say it is a bit scary that I have all these voices in my head; the two I have let out in particular. As this is my 1st role-play I do kind of wonder if the characters I have created should be talking to me as much as they are. My fiction characters talk to me, but not as aggressively and not as often as these two. I can ignore my fiction characters sometimes. Not these two. The one, Therese, is particularly aggressive. I know that she is very much a part of me. A side of my personality I keep a very tight leash on. But man, is she temperamental. If I, or even one of the other characters, do something she doesn’t like she stops talking to me all together. Worse yet, sometimes she just takes over; I’m no longer writing; I just happen to be the easiest way to the keyboard. No I don’t have MPD, I am aware of everything that is happening and do still have control over my actions so if you thought anything like that, well, you’re wrong. I guess the characters are more real, because they have other people to interact with, people who aren’t also me, so things are a bit more real. By real I mean there is a give and take in conversation, and you can’t predict exactly how the other person is going to react. So the characters have a natural give and take in conversation, awkward pauses, and even develop relationships/friendships. Its good fun. On the down side of life the site is currently down… stupid bandwidth… so I am having to entertain myself and get the writing bug out another way. Lar! So there you have it; my take on my 1st role-play. It is a good thing. Now, if the site would just come back…

      That was SO very wrong!!! But in SUCH a good way! I just went to burn a copy of a Led Zeppelin CD (that I bought I might add… none of this downloading crap). I put in the blank CD I put in the CD to copy and it launches a QuickTime video of a live performance of Kashmir. I adore Led; I love Kashmir, and have an unholy passion for Robert Plant’s voice. Watching the performance, to see him in all of his rock god glory (all that hair!) was phenomenally cool, to say the very least. I think I’m going to watch it again… and again… and maybe, yeah you guessed it… again!

      My battle cry for today is “Embrace your randomness!” I am actually one of the most random people I know. Sure I do the mature, coherent, socially responsible things I’m supposed to; you know, go to work, pay the bills and pretend to be a productive member of society, but where is the fun in that? Last night, I went out to restart the drier and I didn’t quite make it. I got outside and that storm was coming in so I decided to just take a walk to the end of the driveway. The next thing I know I’m five blocks from home in my bare feet. I’m not even sure how it happened; it just seemed like a good idea at the time. Now on the down side of life I have got a nasty blister on one foot, it has popped and it hurts; but it was worth it. The walk was great. The cement was warm on my feet, the air was cool and humid, the wind was strong and sweet with the smell of dust, precipitation and creosote. You miss out on those moments if you don’t just go with random impulses.

      To quote someone, “Bugger all this for a lark!” I’m just grouchy and restless, but what the hell does one do on a Monday night? I didn’t get to play pool tonight, I had to come home and do my laundry. I hate being responsible and I love playing pool. So how did laundry win out over practice? The only down side of shooting pool is usually I’m the only woman there other than the bar tender. Now sometimes I don’t mind flirting or picking up a game that way. But, a lot of the time the guys are borderline to out and out low lives and must be ditched, they don’t understand that I am there to practice/learn. Just try and convince a guy like that a  woman &nbsp; can and wants to play pool. Mind you I’m not brilliant, but I have an idea of what end of the queue to use. … Next rant. My favorite website ever is currently down for bandwidth issues so I can’t play there. Now, I know that is no ones fault and so I’m not mad… I’m just like a big kid and I really want it because I can’t have it. That, and I have grown rather fond of the people on that site and kind of miss them. You know how that goes. Let’s see… what else? I’m not in a dolling mood so that kill any idea of screwing around with my graphics. I am currently pissed off with my truck, because the battery died this morning just as I was going to work, so guess who was late to work. And on top of that my fish Bruce is looking at me funny.   The only…  only &nbsp; redeeming quality to this evening is there is a storm building right now. It is really quite lovely; black sky, wind, lightening… the works. Bummer, no thunder yet, but I’m sure it is on its way. There had damned well better be thunder and rain too (there is no rain just yet)! The humidity was horrible today and the heat with that, I mean it feels like you are wearing the weather.&nbsp; Oh well. This may be my least coherent entry to date and I’m oddly proud of that. I’m going to find a drink and/or restart the drier.   Oh yeah, if you were wondering... I didn't get that job that I ranted about in the last entry. *Shakes fist at managment!*

      Right gang, here is the deal. I am applying for this dot damn job for the third time. I know I’m going to get shot down and it pisses me off. First I’m pissed that I will get shot down, most likely before I ever get the interview. It is massively irritating to know I can do the job and that quite frankly I am the best qualified and have the most seniority and to know I will get passed over. Hell they already have the person they want picked out and she has only been in the department 3 months… 4 tops. Second I’m pissed with myself because I can’t leave it alone. I should know when I’m beat but no… I’m too dumb to do anything but go down swinging. I am such an idiot! Does this make me a masochist? Nah… I really don’t care. I just want to make them work. If they are too dumb to see how good I am… screw em.

      Ok folks… two observations today. One, the Butterfly Effect is a pretty good movie. This Aston Kutcher guy (spelling?) can almost act. It was relatively original kind of creepy and pretty well done. I really liked it. But the ending was depressing as hell. I’m going to brood on that for a while.  Two, people are jackasses. Someone swiped my license plate. Yeah you heard me… swiped, took, removed, nicked. I mean there is my truck sitting in the drive way and they take off with my plate. Hell I didn’t even notice. I don’t look at the back of my truck every day. Oh well. I called the cops and the DMV and it doesn’t sound like a big deal, its just mondo annoying. Worse yet, they took my license plate frame. I had been meaning to change it out but still… where do you get an ASU class of 2001 plate frame in the year 2004?

      Here is yon deal gang… is it wrong that some of my favorite drinking pals are my siblings? I man no one is a more entertaining drunk than Siato (my youngest brother). Now granted today was just a happy hour thing and everyone walked away sober but still it was his bright idea to converge on Four Peaks and play cards. I don’t think our waitress knew what to do with us. Siato, a friend of his and I were there playing cards and shouting insults at each other. It was great fun. The biggest downer is that my sister and other brother couldn’t make it, but we got over that.  I really needed the break too. I’ve been pulling OT since last Monday, every day at least two hours OT, four to five on the weekends. YUCK! The other thing is they have me keeping stats for the department. This job is a pay grade up and requires at least… and I mean at the VERY LEAST a week of training. I get no raise and only two days training. It’s kind of stressful. If I weren’t enjoying it so damn much I’d get cross.  Oh yeah, I bought a pair of blue shoes, heels to be exact. They are mono cute and relatively comfy. They are styled to look like a dressy tennis shoe and even have the little stripes on the side. I bought them on Sunday. I went to the register with a black pair and that’s all I was going to get but they told me that I could get another pair for half price… SOLD! I am slowly turning into a shoe whore. Oh well… there are worse ways to go.  I think I want another drink, but I’m not sure. I’ll think about that for a while and probably talk myself out of it. But I do plan on going to sleep soon. Man I’m beat!

      Right gang here is yon deal. A lot of my blog entries of late have centered around my favorite RPG, so I have created a blog just for those thoughts. (Who says I’m not a Virgo?)  I’ve never played in an RPG before so I these alignments, you know Lawful Good, True Neutral, Chaotic Evil and the like, they fascinate me. When I signed up for this board you didn’t have to use those terms. It was basically are you a good guy a bad guy or a neutral guy. Well (to the benefit of all I think) they are requiring all new characters to identify with one of these alignments. Heck, the mods even provided a link to an alignment test to help you sort it out.  Any way, I took it once for both of my characters and I think I’m starting to figure out why they don’t like each other. Reign came up as Neutral Good and Therese came out as Neutral Evil. I was really surprised how many of their answers were the same.  Now personally I think Reign is more of a Chaotic Good and that’s how I play her, but the point here is these characters are not all that different. I think they see the worst of themselves in the other. I know I have a hard time liking people who are too similar to me.  I’m now thinking of the best way to reintroduce the two of them (they have a history before this RPG started…at least that’s what I wrote). I wonder who comes out alive? But that’s a question for another time.
