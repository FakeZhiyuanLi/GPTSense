       'Walis tambo' to sweep foreign shores  Posted: 8:16 PM  Feb. 21, 2004 Joyce Mejillano, Inquirer Southern Luzon Bureau Inquirer News Service  MANITO, Albay -- With an abundance of tiger grass, locally called tambo or talahib, this remote and small agricultural town by the Albay Gulf, some 50 kilometers southeast of Legazpi City, is dreaming to soon capture the international market for its quality soft brooms. Manito, which offers a scenic view of the Mayon Volcano and the Albay Gulf, is rich in tiger grass that grows in almost 35 percent of Manito's 10,740 hectares of land. Tiger grass is considered the town's bread and butter, after fishing. Tiger grass is used in making soft broom or samud in Bicol and walis tambo in Tagalog. The soft broom industry has been the source of income of about 85 percent of the town's population of 20,000. It gives opportunity to the villagers, especially the women, to augment the income of their respective families. Mayor Carmencita Daep says almost all of the 15 barangays of the municipality have tiger grass grown in their area and the soft broom industry is considered as a backyard business of many families. It is being sold to different parts of the country, especially in Baguio City and Metro Manila. It has also been the source of income of the people in charge of its distribution to both local and outside markets. Villagers engaged in soft broom making say some of them earn as high as 200 pesos per day.   Process  Tiger grass is easy to grow and is ready for harvest after a year. But this kind of grass is very prone to pests such as mites, thus, many farmers plant sweet potatoes to ward off the pests. According to Manito folk, the months of April, May and June are considered the peak season in the industry. After harvest, tiger grass is sun-dried for about three days to ensure its strength. While it is being dried, the farmers remove its flowers by threshing. Once the grass turns yellowish, it is ready to be assembled, which the local folks called "pagbudbod" (tying) where a handful or "kumkom" of tiger grass is tied to a stick, usually about eight centimeters long, using a hard and soft plastic or rattan tier. To enhance its look and increase its value, soft broom makers decorate the product by making various designs, usually done through the help of colorful plastic tiers. The finished products cost around P25 to P85 each, depending on the intricacy of the design.   Struggle  The Manito soft broom industry, however, is faced with an identity crisis. One often sees the product labeled as "Made in Baguio City." To solve the problem, the local government and local broom makers from the 15 barangays of Manito came up with a cooperative, the San Rafael Development Cooperative (Sadeco), which is now responsible for controlling the quality, price and marketing of the soft brooms. Organized in 2002, the Sardeco buys the farmers' produce and looks for its market in and outside the Bicol Region. The municipal government lent 10,000 pesos for the initial fund of the cooperative while the Department of Agriculture also gave Sardeco 200,000 pesos to develop the industry-from tiger grass farming to producing quality soft brooms. "There are some broom makers here who sell the product at a very low price, while some are not strict with the quality. Then, there are those who easily concede to branding the products as 'Made in Baguio,' so how can we develop good reputation and establish a name if this is the case?" says Evelyn Logronio, Sardeco chair. Logronio says they have now come up with a new style of packaging, a plastic label ordered from Metro Manila, which when dipped in hot water or exposed to hot temperature sinks and sticks tight to the broom holder. Sardeco alone produces and distributes more than 20,000 pieces of soft brooms every peak season. This is aside from the production of individual manufacturers in the municipality, who are non-Sardeco members and still have their own market up to now.   Market  Logronio says they are now improving the quality of the town's soft broom to target the international market. Daep recalls that during her visit to Hongkong with Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara, they made an investment promotion activity and talked to Bicolanos about the possible export of soft brooms in that place. The mayor says the Hong Kong-based Bicolanos agreed to develop the market in their area. They have also been participating in different trade exhibits to let the people know that this humble town by the bay could produce a world-class quality soft broom.

        Bicol village 'shocked and awed'   Aug 20, 2004 By Joyce Mejillano Inquirer News Service   Editor's Note: Published on page A1 of the August 20, 2004 issue of the Philippine Daily Inquirer   "MAY SYUTING!"The village children saw television cameras and thought it was a movie crew setting up for a location shoot.Were they excited? A news photographer said it was closer to "shocked and awed."Barangay Poblacion in Presentacion, Camarines Sur, is a remote coastal village that had surely never seen anything like it -- a press retinue. Until Wednesday, when over 30 vehicles bearing local and national media people rolled in at about 4 p.m.The village sprung up. Intrigued residents bounded out of their homes and followed the convoy, which stopped at a cemented portion of the main road in Sitio Santa Maria."Naalintanga (amazed)," was how another photographer described the gathering crowd.CluelessVillagers were clueless for the most part, Barangay Captain Angeline Bordonada admitted. From radio and television reports, they had heard of the abduction of two soldiers by the communist New People's Army, she said. But no one knew the captives were being held in the province, or that they were expected to be released in their town that day.Bordonada had just come from Naga City and "was really surprised to see lots of media vehicles and cameramen from such companies as GMA 7 and ABS-CBN." She said representatives of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, who served as media coordinators that day, told her what was going on.Shortly before 6 p.m., the two soldiers -- 1Lt. Rolando Fidelino and Pfc. Ronel Nemeño -- arrived with their families and some government officials for a press briefing following the formal turnover in the nearby hills.'Very simple'Bordonada believed the event was nothing less than "historic."Poblacion is a "very simple" community, the barangay captain said, with a population of 5,784 as of last year. Most of the townsfolk are farmers and fishermen. More than three hours by car from Naga City and accessible only through an uncemented road-traversing a mountainous terrain and overlooking the Pacific Ocean-the place is considered remote.The visiting media men had come from Cagsawa Park in Daraga, Albay. They left at 11:30 a.m., drove through rugged roads, thick dust and over some muddy stretches, and reached their destination hungry and exhausted.Though it crossed their minds that the event could result in the military branding their village a rebel-infested area, majority of Poblacion residents were "thankful" for the brief episode in the limelight.Blessing in disguise?Quite a few turned out to sell dried fish and other foodstuff to the visitors, happily making some extra money.A man in her mid-40s who has lived in Poblacion all his life said the event obviously concerned the whole country and was therefore important. "We are proud to be part of this," he said.BenefitMore important, he told the Inquirer, the nationwide media exposure could only benefit the village and, in fact, the whole municipality-maybe even all towns in the country like Presentacion."You see the condition of our roads?" he said. "We hope this will be one way for the government to see what people in remote areas have to endure."

       urlLink    Mount Malinao faces  clear, present danger Posted: 7:21 AM (Manila Time) | May 15, 2003 By Joyce Mejillano Inquirer News Service  Flora, fauna refuge  SERVING as a refuge to many species of endemic plants and animals, Mount Malinao in Albay province is one of the few remaining forests in the country that is in dire need of protection.   A team from the Institute of Biological Sciences of the University of the Philippines-Los Baños in Laguna found during an expedition last year that the mountain has been an important home of the Philippine Fairy Bluebird and other endangered species endemic only to Luzon Island.       	 Malinao is one of several mountains that form a volcanic chain in the Bicol region, along with Mount Isarog, Mount Iriga, Mount Masaraga and the country's majestic Mayon Volcano on the eastern border of the peninsula.   At its northern foot lies the Lalo River that flows to Lake Buhi, home of sinarapan, the world's smallest fish. At the eastern portion is the Quinale River that spills into the Lagonoy Gulf, home of the breathtaking Curangon Riffs.   Malinao has an inner crater facing the coastal areas of the town, which is between Tiwi town and Tabaco City. The crater was earlier described as a primordial forest that resembled a "lost world" where steep slopes were covered with lush forest.   Many say Malinao, which means "clear," doesn't actually live up to its name since the mountain, especially its peak, is often covered with clouds that obscure the sight.   The lower edges of the mountain extend to the northeast toward the coast, forming steep cliffs along the eastern portion of the shoreline between Camarines Sur province and Albay. This area is covered mostly with secondary forests and the country's best hardwood species, like narra and molave.   Much of the remaining rainforest cover is found on the eastern slopes of the mountain and mostly hidden from view unless observed from Tabaco and Tiwi.   Around 15 species of endangered fauna -- including eight species of bird, two species of frogs and two species of lizards -- can be found in the mountain, according to the expedition's report. Four species of dipterocarps and a big number of different varieties of orchids, some of which are known to be endemic only in Albay, can also be found.   Malinao also has different forest types along its slopes.   Deteriorating charm   Behind the fascinating beauty of the mountain, local government officials and environmentalists are alarmed over its apparent deterioration, threatening the rare creatures in its forest refuge.   "Malinao is now under threat from excessive harvesting of species with economic values and other manmade activities," said Rodolfo Matusalem, provincial environment and natural resources officer, in a report released during the launching of the Malinao Biodiversity Conservation and Eco-Tourism Program on March 27.   The transformation of natural habitats into agricultural plantations and other sites, climate change, as well as "environmental pollutants" arising from increasing human demand for limited natural resources, also contribute to its degradation, Matusalem added.   He warned that saving Malinao's forest had become urgent, and concerned parties and individuals should now worry about the decline of numerous species, genetic diversity and even the whole ecosystem of the mountain.  Protected area   The local government has initiated moves to preserve its "last frontier." It already passed a resolution urging President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Department of Energy, to proclaim Mount Malinao a protected area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (Nipas) Act of 1991.   The move, according to Carlos Cortan, representative of the town council during the launching of the project, "is directed toward the ecological management, rehabilitation and development of the area to be undertaken in a sustainable manner to ensure the conservation of its biological diversities."       	 The campaign earned support from concerned government agencies and other non-government groups and private entities like Philippine Geothermal Inc. in Tiwi. They, in turn, urged the local government to design and provide alternative livelihood programs to affected stakeholders, especially those who depend mainly on forest resources as source of their daily subsistence.   Amy Deniega, head of the Department of Education in Malinao, said "the government needs to give them another source of livelihood so they can also survive if resources from the mountain should become unavailable due to its protected status," she said.   The local officials were urged to hold consultations, especially among stakeholders, to get sentiments from all sides.   Cortan said that if the degradation of Malinao continued, its coastal area would also suffer, especially because Malinao has its Curangon Shoal, which is home to many marine species. Some of the species are already considered endangered.   The Curangon Shoal, according to Maria Ravanilla, tourism regional director, is on the map of the nation's best diving sites.   "If we (do) not act now, this natural beauty surrounding Mt. Malinao will also deteriorate," Cortan said.      &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    A father's wish  for 4 blind kids Posted: 7:14 AM (Manila Time) | Jul. 24, 2003 By Joyce Mejillano  Inquirer News Service Born blind   LEGAZPI CITY, Albay -- Eleven-year-old Maricel Cantoria was just as excited as the other children in their far-flung village of Calipantawan in San Jacinto town, Masbate, about an hour's ride by boat from the Masbate City proper, when classes opened in June.   But unlike other schoolers, she is being taught alone by Nena Delavin, who shares and dedicates her spare time imparting special lessons for the visually impaired.       	 Though she should be in Grade 5 at her age, Maricel feels honored that she is at least attending a class.   She and two sisters -- 5-year-old Princess Sara and 3-year-old Leizel -- and brother Cris, 6 months, were born blind. But they have never lost hope that someday, their dreams would come true.   Incurable   Maricel is the third among eight Cantoria children, while Princess Sara is the sixth, followed by Leizel and Cris.   Their four brothers have normal eyesight.   Arles Cantoria, 38, their father, said he had had the eyes of his children checked by specialists in Legazpi City and in Masbate, but the doctors claimed that the defect could no longer be corrected, even through surgery.   Still, he has not lost hope.   Arles is a construction worker, while his wife Marilyn stays at home to look after their children, especially the youngest, Cris.   Records from Dr. Rollo Milante of the Legazpi Eye Center, who checked on the three girls on April 17 last year, show that the children have micro-ophthalmia or undeveloped eyes. Some doctors say they did not know of any medical treatment for the defect.   Delavin said a doctor in Manila whom she consulted about the girls' defect likewise said such condition was usually untreatable. Dreams  But the abnormality had not lost Maricel's hopes and dreams. Arles said she keeps on telling them that she wants to be a teacher someday, especially for the blind, so she can also help her sisters become literate despite their condition.   He said they were thankful when Delavin, a teacher in the San Jacinto Elementary School, volunteered to teach Maricel after her regular classes.       	 Princess Sara has her own dreams. She is interested in music and wants to be a singer someday, Arles said.   Delavin found the girls to be talented. Maricel learns fast, she said. The same is true with Sarah, whom she also easily gets along with when the latter comes with her sister to school.   The sisters have special talents like singing and are good in memorizing literary pieces such as poems, the teacher said.   She said she was touched by Maricel's perseverance. "Imagine, she, together with her elder brother who keeps her company, comes all the way from a really far village that takes more than an hour to go to school on a tricycle," she said.   When they have no money, they walk to school, Delavin said.   Delavin also wants a cane for Maricel as she noticed that the young girl uses a crooked stick as "alternative eyes."   Hindrance   Arles fears that his children might not receive proper education. "There's no school in Masbate exclusively for the blind, and if we let them study outside Masbate in the future, I know it's impossible since we are poor," he said.   Delavin admitted that she could sustain teaching them only until Grade 6. Her training, she said, was meant only for the elementary level.   She said she sometimes allowed Maricel to attend her regular classes as she still had to undergo special lessons.   With the help of some equipment she acquired from the Resources for the Blind, Maricel was able to learn how to read.   "What's bothering me also is who will guide them when they grow up and if we're no longer in this world?" Arles confided.   He said his eldest child, a 15-year-old boy, had been forced to stop his high school studies to look after Maricel.   Arles wished his children would be given proper education aside from dreaming of a "miracle gift" that can enable them to see the world.   "With our poor life, we often wonder what to do to help my children," he said.    &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink   Effective pesticide from chili pepper Posted: 6:14 AM (Manila Time)  Jul. 25, 2004 By Joyce Mejillano Inquirer News Service BIRD'S eye chili pepper or siling labuyo may be a favorite plant of the Bicolanos but it could be one of the worst enemies of insects.  Ofelia Peralta, 57, a gardening enthusiast and owner of a school in Legazpi City in Albay province, found this out when she mixed a handful of ground siling labuyo in a gallon of water, and sprayed it on her plants at least once a day.      Worms, ants and other insects were instantly killed, she said.  Since then, Peralta has used the mixture to drive insects away from her garden and grow more beautiful plants.  "I use organic [fertilizer]. Not only do the artificial things, especially pesticide, affect our ozone layer, they're bad [for] our health, too," she said.  Peralta said she had shared her natural pesticide to friends. "It's not only environment-friendly, it's not expensive, too," she said.  "There's really no problem in supply. You can see siling labuyo almost everywhere. It's abundant, especially here in Bicol," she added.  Recently, Peralta received the Saringgaya Award from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Bicol. The award is given to individuals, groups or companies that have contributed to environmental preservation.   urlLink

       urlLink    Angelica, 2, needs a liver transplant By Joyce Mejillano Inquirer News Service  DARAGA, Albay -- The fear of losing their fifth and youngest child to a liver illness haunts the Manzanilla couple like a nightmare.   "I always fear that that day will come when I wake up only to find my daughter Angelica is gone," Leticia Manzanilla said in between sobs in their small house in remote Barangay Gapo in Daraga, Albay.       	 Angelica was diagnosed as having biliary atresia (a liver condition in which the bile ducts are absent, inflamed or unable to convey bile out of the organ) when she was still 6 weeks old.   According to information from the Internet (www.liver.ca), biliary atresia begins in early infancy and causes damage to the liver due to the destruction of ducts, which connect the liver to the small intestine. The patient's liver soon becomes cirrhotic and he eventually dies. The condition normally occurs in one in every 10,000 to 20,000 births, usually in a first-born baby girl.   When she was 6 weeks old, Angelica had already undergone a six-hour operation to repair her bile ducts through the Kasai method at the V. Luna Memorial Hospital in Quezon City. That was the time her doctors noticed her condition.   Due to financial constraints, the family decided to bring Angelica home in Bicol. "The doctors prescribed her medicines for maintenance. Now, she takes six kinds of medicine and vitamins every day. So, we just now rely on medicines and, of course, our faith in God," Leticia said.   She said they had also approached even traditional healers, but Angelica's condition had not changed.   "She's very weak and malnourished. She eats limited food though it seems like she likes to eat almost anything. She competes with her siblings in reaching for the food on the table," Leticia said.   Early last month, Angelica suffered from high fever and flu, and was rushed to the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital.   "I thought it was her time already. Every time she feels so different, we are all worried and think that it's already her time," Leticia said, crying.   Angelica's doctor told the Manzanillas that the baby needed a liver transplant that would cost about three million pesos.   The Inquirer learned that the country did not have facilities for such a delicate operation, and the couple was told that in case the money was raised, the operation could be done in Korea, Taiwan or in any country abroad which has sophisticated medical equipment.   Already financially drained from Angelica's costly medicines and other family needs, the couple said it was almost impossible to have the operation.   "I felt dizzy when the doctor told us how much we need to have her operated," said Leticia, an elementary teacher. Her salary usually goes to her child's medicines and other needs amounting to about 500 pesos a day, plus the unexpected cost of hospitalization every time her condition changes, she said.   They appealed to Good Samaritans for help to save their daughter through prayers or financial assistance, or both.   (Those who want to help Angelica may contact the PDI Southern Luzon Bureau, at tel. nos. (052) 8208402, (052) 8201989 or (052) 8205051.) &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Classrooms without walls,  have leaves for roofs  Posted:6:43 AM (Manila Time) | Jun. 13, 2004  By Joyce Mejillano and Perry Calara Inquirer News Service  	 MASBATE CITY -- For the teachers and students of this public secondary school in Placer town, the start of classes in June is also the start of their agony.   The beads of perspiration on the face of Florante Ngoho, head of the Vivencio P. Casas Sr. Memorial High School (VPCSMHS), spoke eloquently of his struggle to keep the school afloat.   Located about three hours' ride from this city, VPCSMHS is a building with two makeshift classrooms that have no windows. The school opened in 2002.  For Ngoho, receiving visitors from the Department of Education-Masbate was a welcome pause from his daily battle to make the school run as efficiently as humanly possible.   It was also an opportunity for him to confide in others the long-time problem about the need for more buildings and better facilities.   Leaves for roofs   Since it was almost impossible to teach hundreds of students in just two classrooms, Ngoho had to mobilize his stakeholders into building makeshift classrooms.  With the help of 30 students and a teacher, he went to his small farm to get wooden posts for the classrooms.  And for roofing and walls, "we assigned the students to bring salidang (woven coco-leaves)," Ngoho told the Inquirer.   Most of the students are children of poor farmers. Some of them have to walk a few kilometers just to get to school.  The students have to bring their own chairs because the government could provide only 50 chairs for them.  4 blackboards, 2 chairs  The nine teachers of VPCSMHS share the school's only four blackboards, two chairs and four tables. Ngoho solicited the tables from generous hearts.   Books are kept in a makeshift library that doubles as a visitor's lounge. They are positioned in a way that would keep them from getting wet when rain seeps through holes in the roof.  If it pours, teachers and students scurry around to find a secure place to keep the books dry.  This school year, Ngoho is expecting more enrollees that could reach up to about 620 students by June 21, compared to 460 during the school year 2003-2004.   "That's really a problem," Ngoho said. "We cannot reject children who want to go to school."   69 students, 1 teacher  Student-teacher ratio this school year will be about 69 students per teacher.  The two classrooms were built out of solicitations from the Parents-Teachers Association and the local government unit (LGU).  "And we solicited our deep well from the governor," Ngoho said.   The basketball court is also being built through "community-solicitation" efforts.  "Construction of the court has started," Ngoho said. "I asked the children to bring five small rocks each for its construction."  VPCSMHS' plight is duplicated in other schools in the province.  San Pablo National High School, in Mandaon town, Masbate province, is encountering the same problems as Ngoho's school.   The students of the Luy-a National High School in Aroroy town also hold their classes in makeshift rooms without walls and with woven coconut leaves as roofing to keep the heat and the rains away.  The same situation has been experienced by teachers and students of Quinayangan High School in Balud town and Nabangig National High School in Palanas.  In Mandaon National High School, the stage used for some school programs serves as an alternative classroom.  VPCSMHS is a target beneficiary of the Secondary Education Development and Improvement Project (SEDIP), a DepEd project for poor provinces.   The project is funded by the Asian Development Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the Philippine government.  SEDIP has allotted about P160 million for school buildings in Masbate. But the project does not fund the entire cost.   Thus, SEDIP officials and school heads like Ngoho have to get equity from local government units, from congressmen's Priority Development Assistance Fund, from non-government organizations or philanthropic individuals.  Only 75 percent of Ngoho's school building construction requirements will be shouldered by SEDIP, so they had to lobby for the remaining 25-percent equity.  Keep trying  The local officials gave a positive response, but this came before the May 10 elections and the town now has a new set of public officials.  Wiping the perspiration from his forehead, Ngoho told his SEDIP visitors: "As long as we live, let's keep on trying."  Ngoho also has to solicit the salaries of his teachers from the Special Education Fund (SEF).   Only four teachers at VPCSMHS, including Ngoho, have regular items. The rest have to survive on a monthly net pay of P2,000 each.  Teachers at VPCSMHS can be considered lucky if they compare their salaries with those of the teachers at the Palanas Agricultural High School (PAHS), in Santa Cruz, Palanas, Masbate.  Two PAHS teachers still receive (from the municipal SEF) P1,500 a month -- almost equal to that of a household help in urban areas.  Ngoho has to spend for his teachers' training.   Many teachers in Masbate are handling subjects that are not their majors, so someone with an English major ends up teaching science or math subjects.  Since VPCSMHS has no budget for maintenance, operations and other expenses, Ngoho spends for all his travels and trainings. He estimates that, in two years, he has spent about P40,000 out of his own pocket.  If Ngoho has official business in Masbate City, 90 kilometers from Placer, he uses his own motorbike, the trip costing him P70. Otherwise, commuting would cost him P200.   Elusive dream  Dr. Teresita Diaz-Naz, DepEd regional director, said the lack of classrooms was really one of the department's major problems during the opening of classes.  The problem has perennially hounded DepEd and becomes worse as the number of students increases.  VPCSMHS and other schools in Masbate typify the situation of other schools in the region, or maybe even in the entire country.   For each of those schools, good facilities, like decent classrooms with windows and with roofs that do not leak when it rains, remain an elusive dream.  Those interested in helping Florante Ngoho or the VPCSMHS and other high schools, especially in Masbate, can call phone no. 0920-9112835.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Nagarao Island:  Almost paradise Posted: 6:14 AM (Manila Time) | Mar. 27, 2003 By Joyce Mejillano and Ronnie Lorejo Inquirer News Service  Rich fishing ground  MASBATE CITY -- For fisherman Fausto Catagman and his wife Rebecca, there is no place like Nagarao, a two-hectare island south of Masbate province whose surrounding waters are a rich fishing ground.   Situated some 40 minutes by boat from the mainland Masbate town of Placer and more than 90 km from Masbate City proper, Nagarao is home to 115 families who depend mainly on fishing for their livelihood.   "We always have a bountiful harvest of fish, which we never had in our former place," Fausto said.   The couple moved to the island six years ago from Esperanza town after fellow fishermen discovered the place.   "Life was difficult in our previous place of residence. Our catch was limited. So when we discovered this island and found that there was plenty of fish here, I decided to transfer my family," the 37-year-old Fausto said.   The Catagmans, like other families in Nagarao, usually catch at least 50 kilos of fish daily, which they sell at 25 pesos a kilo to their regular buyer from Cebu.   "We earn about 1,000 pesos a day when we have a good catch," Fausto boasted.   Other marine products, like crabs, shrimps, squid, clams and shellfish, also abound.   Some villagers are also engaged in diving, searching for "hagdanan" (clams) and other shellfish which are best served as "kilawin" (raw dish with vinegar and other spices).   Tranquilino Sy, the village's top councilor, said the hagdanan were sold at 25 to 30 pesos each, depending on size.   Other villagers collect seaweeds, which are also sold to manufacturers.   Not left behind   Despite its seeming isolation from the rest of the world, Nagarao has embraced modern technology.   Almost 70 percent of the villagers enjoy the benefits of electricity produced by the barangay-owned generator. A family pays a certain amount for gasoline consumption on a monthly basis.   Those who can afford amenities even have cable televisions served by Dream cable company.   Despite the 1,000-peso daily earning of most of the families, most of their children do not go to school. Out of some 200 children in the island, only 30 are in school.   Some families can afford to send their children to school in Placer or in Cebu City, which is almost three hours away by boat.   Eight-year-old Benito wants to follow in the footsteps of his father as a fisherman. He has been exposed to making "kitang" (a fishing tool using hooks) five years ago. He and his 6-year-old sister Joanna do not know how to read and write.   His mother Vicky, however, still yearns for them to be in school but, according to her, schooling is really so expensive that only those with extra money can afford it.   Learning center  Arnulfo Rivalde, who is on his third term as barangay chair, said a learning center had already been established in the community last year and accommodated about 40 Grade 1 pupils.   "We are happy that we now have a learning center to cater to our kids. Somehow, the new generation won't grow up ignorant," a mother of three said as she played with her daughter.    She said she taught her children how to read and write because the family didn't have enough money to send them to school. Her children are aged 10, 8 and 6 years old.   And even if they had, just the thought of being away from them for quite sometime at their young age, would have been unbearable, she said.   "We're not used to being separated from them as they are still young and needing attention," she stressed.   A family in Nagarao has four to five children.   Aside from proper education, the villagers are deprived of health services. Although Nagarao has two health workers, it does not have a clinic to accommodate the sick. The residents have to transport the sick to the mainland to get proper medical attention, even if the waters are rough.   Amid the bounty of the sea, living in an almost isolated place is also expensive. The villagers still buy their basic needs in Placer or Esperanza every weekend. Due to the distance, they spend more for transportation or at least 1,000 pesos for gasoline.   They also buy drinking water from the mainland at 10 pesos per container.   Best haven   Despite their depravity and isolation, most families do not want to go back to their former places, saying Nagarao is the best fishing ground for them.   Most villagers are no longer afraid whenever typhoons and other natural calamities occur. Fortunately for them, they have not experienced any tidal wave since they came to the island.   "No matter how isolated our place is, we believe that we have found the best place under the sun," Fausto said.   And those who have visited the island agree with him.   Blessed with white beaches, the island can be a world-class tourist destination. The warmth of its people and the delicious seafood add spice to its beauty.   Fausto said that some tourists, both foreigners and locals, on an adventure trip had already visited the island and that some spots could be considered the best sites for diving, snorkeling and other underwater activities.   Placer Vice Mayor Lily Conde Lim said Nagarao has great tourism potential. And the officials are just very much willing to show to the world that they have not just one but many of God's beautiful works of art. &nbsp; urlLink
