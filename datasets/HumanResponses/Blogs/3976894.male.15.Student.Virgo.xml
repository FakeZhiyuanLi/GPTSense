      I have been in Peru for almost a week now, and it it just like I remember it: The land of the dirt people. It is so great over here though, cuz everything is cheap. The currency here is called nuevos soles, or soles for short. And the currency exchange is 1 US dollar = 3.6 soles. Now thnk about it, i am the richest dude in Peru. Things are so cheap. I went to the supermarket and bought ten 2-liters of sodas for 5 soles total. Thats like $1.50 US money. I love Peru, and IÂ´m thinking of living here when I grow up, lol. I am recording a lot with our digital camcorder, so I might stream it later on my new website.  Here is the typical meals of the day. Breakfast is a peice of hard bread with old milk. EveryDay. Lunch is the big meal around here, and it usually has chicken in it. EVERYTHING has chicken it here in Peru, even the orange juice. There is no dinner here, only a cup of tea and bread. Sad, I know.  I have to go now, my hour ran out, since i was on GB for a while. Bye!

      I have had this migraine for the last 2 days and it is killing me. I just wish it would go away damnit. I already overdosed shouldn't that take the pain away?! I dunno...I guess I'm just stressed cuz I'm leaving in 2 days. My flight leaves at 2:00 PM and I'm pretty sure that it is going to be one long flight.   I am letting my buddy Rudy borrow my PS2, since i can't take it to Peru. In return, he is letting me borrow 29 GBA games. It's alot, and i don't think i will be able to get through half of them. Oh well, I'm pretty sure that a lot of the games I will not even be interested in. But I'm looking forward to playing a lot of Zelda games, like the old NES version and Four Swords on my GBA, along with these japanese unreleased-in-the-USA version. He is a rich guy, so I'm getting hooked up. Freakin' awesome.  Speaking of GBA, my Brother in-law bought a GBA SP Classic edition to use on the plane. After this whole trip, he is giving it to me, which means I probably will sell my old one to an idiot at my school who will buy it for $70. I like the classic edition of GBA SP because it looks just like the original NES's rectangle control. It looks pretty cool. The cool part about all of this is that my sister got a 50 pack of AA batteries from her work. I'll be entertained at least!  Well I feel like playing GunBound right now so I will blog later! See ya People.

      I just added some stuff to my Blog, and i think that it looks very cool. I had the poll a purplish color, and some of my buddies thought it was super gay. So i was like screw it I'll change it for the better.  &nbsp; I am watching my sister play with her son. He just got a haircut, and she does not like it so much. I just got a haircut too. I just got a trim and it looks pretty kool. Both of my sister's kids went hysterical when they got their hair cuts. It was funny, but sad at the same time. We had to shove a lollipop into my neice's&nbsp; mouth to stop her from crying.  &nbsp; I pretty much had a crappy day. Aw well. School sucked. Looking forward to a better tomorrow. Well Blog on people.

      Meh. I am going to Peru in a few days. I am leaving on the 23rd and coming back in 5 weeks. I haven't been to Peru since&nbsp;I was like 6 years old. This really sucks because my relatives over there are going to treat me like some kind of royal figure. I am not the kind who likes a lot attention, escept from my close family. Apparently, they are preparing like crazy over there for when we arrive. I hear that they are even getting  hot water  for us. This is gonna be a little uncomfortable, meeting people that I have not seen in a long ass time. Oh well. I think i might just keep to myself while I'm over there.
