If you could go back to one place yu've been in your life, where would you go?  6. If you could remove the ability to hate from one person in the world today who would it be?  7. If you were to be the opposite sex for a single day what would you do?

      The men in my life have taught many lessons. Whether they were "just friends" or more, each provided me with unforgettable experiences. Through them I learned to love and hate. I learned when and when not to cry. They showed me how to give and receive. They helped me forgive and forget. Through them I knew pain and joy. Whether the experience was positive or negative, their presence in my life was greatly appreciated because the men in my life taught me about me. Much of who I am is because of them and I love them because of that.

         Dear God-    I have been selfish and inconsiderate. I have disappointed those I love and I've been consistently lying to myself by believing that I can handle life alone and being too proud to admit that I need help. I have wondered from my path and have found myself lost in my failures and mistakes. I WANT OUT!!! I want to regain what I once had. I miss the me I used to be-the one who had faith in herself and in her God. HELP ME for I've fallen victim to my own faults and I can't find my way home. AMEN

      This email was sent to me:    Apples Women are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree. Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy....... So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree. Share this with other women who are good apples, even those who have already been picked!  And... Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the shit out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.

      "In the beginning God created the Earth... "  I have my disputes regarding religion. I am a Christian and I believe in the trinity; however, I don't always understand. As a result, I have questions.  I remember an argument we had in Sunday school. Since the beginning of time, there has been an ongoing debate between science and religion. I'm 23 years old. I've been an active church member since the age of 9 and I started taking science courses around the same time. In science I learned about the Big Bang Theory (the scientific version of Earth's creation) but in church I learned that God created the Earth in 7 days. No one really knows the truth about Earth's creation. Science relies on facts and religion runs off faith, so if you're more visual than spiritual, then you're more likely to believe a scientist over a preacher. Now my original Sunday school teacher allowed open discussions, so I introduced the previous issue. I wasn't attempting to reject my religion, I was basically trying to let her know that the issue should be addressed. We spend years in school learning about one thing and then we spend years in church learning the complete opposite. That can be confusing for young children especially when our parents push the importance of education. My questions: How do I maintain my faith when I'm taught that what I believe in is wrong? If God created the earth in 7 days, why does my teacher claim that the Earth was created as a result of the Big Bang Theory? Am I going against my religion by subjecting myself to the teachings of science?  The teacher (who is an advocate of education) informed the class that there was nothing wrong with being taught as long as we maintain our own beliefs. Ok-that satisfied my questions. Now in continuing with our 'open' discussion, I introduced another issue I had. Explanation: I've heard preachers comment on how their religion is "correct" and shun other religions. My experience with religion has revolved around Baptist teachings. I have friends who are Catholic and Jehovah Witness. My father's African Methodist and I've met a Protestant. Each denomination has their own beliefs. My Point: Most religion is based on faith. Having faith indicates that we believe in something. We are physically unable to see it but we believe or have faith in it's existence. My question: Who determined which religion was right? How do we know for sure that what we believe in is correct? What if we worship the same God but reference him differently? The teacher's response:  BLASPHEMY !!

      i believe in the simplicity of love. love is simple (at least the idea of love is simple). the complexity of loving and being loved directly comes from the complex emotions associated with love. its the over rationalizing and overanalyzing...it's the insecurities...the fear of hurting and causing hurt...the pain from past failures and hurts. it's the emptiness you feel when they aren't around...it's the joy of having them there...it's the combination of wanting them to leave but needing them to stay. it's never understanding and not being understood...it's the confusion and frustration after an argument that should have never happened...it's the overwhelming urge to hold them and never letting them ago. it's loving and hating them...it's the fear of giving too much or not giving enough...it's the acts of compromising and sacrificing. the combination of emotions. love is simple but the relationships are hard. relationships are what we make them, and it takes work to make them last. they require being there through good and bad. in relationships we must look beyond faults and meet needs. relationships require loving each other unconditionally. it's about experiencing the emotions and still being in love.

      There are certain times when I wish I was 5 again. I'll be 23 next month and I'm struggling with the idea. It's not because I'm afraid of getting older, but it's because I'm not sure if I like the direction my life is headed. For the past 6 months, I've had this strong feeling that I'm not where I should be. The previous post mentioned my pending major change. I've been in school for about 4 years now, and I'm not happy. I tried explaining this to my mom, but she believes I'm burned out. At first I was all for her diagnosis, but now I know that I really don't like what I'm doing.  You know how churches place sayings on signs outside of the church? Well the church up the street from me posted a saying that really hit home with me. It was something along the lines of  "Your destiny is determined by your passion." When I read it, I felt as if they posted it for me. After reading the saying, I was reminded of a line from Sister Act II. For those that have seen the movie, Whoopi was trying to get Lauryn Hill to join the school choir, and she referenced a book she had read about an aspiring writer. In the book the author stated that "If you wake up in the morning and the first thing you think about is writing then that's what you should be doing."  If you exchange the word 'writing' with the word singing, then you have me. Before leaving high school, I wanted to major in music. I wanted to be a well rounded musician. I wanted to learn the piano, the guitar, strings, and take a few classes on vocal training. Of course I didn't fall through with my decision and now I'm stuck in a place that I honestly believe is not for me. The hardest thing I've ever had to do was realize that this is one obstacle that I cannot overcome, and it's not because I'm not smart enough because I am able to do it, but it's because it is NOT what I want to do.  For the past 4 years, I've been forcing myself to survive in Engineering and it has finally taken it's toll on me. I'm mentally and sometimes physically tired. When I think about going to class or if I drive past Engineering Row, I get this weird and uneasy feeling. I've put so much of my time into this and I'm afraid of letting it go, but it's making me miserable.

      "Now let me introduce myself, My name is..."   I'm not exactly sure where to begin (I'm not a huge fan of introductions). It normally takes several drafts of the first sentence before I begin discussing the paragraph. I guess the best way to start is by giving my name. My government name is Lakenya, most people call me Kenya, and of course everyone has there own special name for me. I am currently enrolled in the Engineering Dept @ Mississippi State University (I am seriously reconsidering my decision).  I am officially a "work in progress". There are several aspects of my life that need reconstruction. I'm definitely not where I want to be but I'm definitely not where I used to be. I've made my mistakes and I'm learning from them the HARD WAY!!!  College has been an interesting experience. It is amazing how much you can change in the course of 6 months and it's equally amazing how much you don't really know about yourself until you are confronted with certain issues.

      I've spent the past few years of my life running away from and avoiding commitment. I'm not the biggest fan of relationships and I've made it a point to make sure that I mention my fear of commitment whenever I enter into new situations (to avoid any suprises).&nbsp;I didn't have&nbsp;many complaints about&nbsp;the way&nbsp;I handled&nbsp;these situations (mainly because they share the same fear).
