      i looooove mondays, just freakin love them!  pffffft...luckily i had a pretty good weekend.  friday night's pubcrawl was hella awesome.  we didn't get to ride on a bus since it was just a mall crawl, but i can only imagine how much crazier that would have been.  lots of drunken fun.  if i can ever figure out how to work technology, i'll get my pictures posted up somewhere.  stay tuned.  saturday was jess' birthday bbq.  lots (maybe too much) of good food and cranium action.  can i get a little SWEEEEEET CAROLINE BAH BAH BAAAAAAAAAH...or perhaps you prefer the SUGA SUGA, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN AAAAAAAAAH HONEY HONEY, DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO YOU ARE MY CAAAANDY GIIIIIIRL, AND YOU'VE GOT ME WANTING YOOOOOOOOU.  haha good times had by all.  i spent sunday on whyte ave with mish and judy, just window shopping and chatting.  the weather could not have been any better. the eye candy was lacking, but ah what can you do.  i saw an old friend from junior high (or rather, she saw me) who just got back from a 4 month trip to australia/new zealand/singapore/thailand with her boyfriend.  soooo jealous!  anyway, we used to be pretty tight, but just lost contact with eachother cuz we ended up going to different schools. everytime we see eachother, we say the same thing, that we HAVE to get together to catch up, but it never happens.  it's sad how people who were once such a big part of your daily life just disappear into oblivion :/  want more to read?  see shu's blog  urlLink here

      i had this mad craving for veggie thins the other day and i just so happened to be in superstore at the time of this craving, so i decided to satisfy it and buy myself some snacks.  i was feeling like a cheap asian so i got the president's choice version instead of the real thing.  there are some things that the folks at pc can mess around with, but veggie thins are not one of them.  should the urge to be asian ever overcome you, DON'T GIVE IN!  get the real thing, otherwise you're gonna be greatly disappointed, and stuck with some gross crackers.  i ended up not making it to the kickboxing class last night due to some miscommunication between my mom and i, but still worked out.  i'm not hurting at all today tho, so i'm not sure that's a good sign.    is anybody else ridiculously grossed out by flies?  i mean, i hate bugs in general, but at least most of them serve a purpose.  bees scare the bejeebers outta me, but they make honey: good!  worms are kinda yucky, but they eat garbage and shit: good!  flies are annoying and hang around the dungpile all day: bad!  anyway, i was not attacked by one, but two of these suckers today, and one of them was the size of a bird.  i was ready to go in for the kill, but alas it was too quick for my catlike reflexes...yes, it has been a long day.

      it's hump day, so that means 2 things: 1.)kickboxing class (YES!) and 2.)canadian idol.  looks to be a good evening.  if there's one thing i've learned from last week's debacle, it's NOT to go hardcore on my own pre-class.  for 3 days i walked around like i had a stick up my ass...not the most pleasant feeling.  last night i went shopping with jess and judes for pubcrawl outfits.  earlier in the day, i had a mishap with my pants (as in the fly broke.  i had to walk into superstore with my purse in front of my crotch before i could duck into an emptry aisle to fix it) so i was looking to get a replacement pair.  why is it that whenever i NEED to find something, i never can?  anyway, i will spare you all from the details of the actual shopping, but i will say this:  I FOUND ME A PAIR OF FUSCHIA PUMPS FOR $20!!!!   ahh, the equivelant of being in heaven.     i'm starting to get rather excited about the festivities for friday.  something about the atmosphere just makes everyone crazy and iluvit.  i'm thinking about having another crawl for my birthday, much like i did last year, but i'm gonna see if i can choose the clubs this time.  the options are rum, globe, i ho and escape in whatever order, so if you have any input, i would love to hear it...then i'mma tell you stfu.  just kidding :D  who can forget the cowboy ("just fu*kn give 'er!") vs. jerry.  JER-REEE!  JER-REEE!  better than anything i've ever seen on springer.  haha

      nothing sucks more than waking up late and then thinking that you're gonna make it to work on time, but only to get screwed cuz you get stuck at a train crossing.  good way to start the day out.  if you haven't realized it by now, i am the worst morning person ever, and somehow my condition is always extra bad when i don't have adequate wake up time.  i should be a little bit more coherent and lively by about 4:30.  on the bright side of things, the weather is fantastic once again (which means that my clean car will stay clean for another day...YAY!) and i'm going shopping after work.  if i can get a little pho thrown in there at some point, my day could actually be saved.  does anybody watch "for love or money"?  i accidently stumbled upon it last week and now i'm kinda hooked.  anyway, what is it about characters on "reality tv" that makes you hate them so much?  i just want to poke the eyes of that one chick rachel.  everytime she does her weird eyeball thing, i just want to punch the television.  ya i know, i need to get a life and get out more :)

      i F!@&$*^ hate mondays.  maybe it's because i hate my job...wait, this isn't a bitchlog.  HA!  anyway, i actually had quite a fabulous weekend.  can't go wrong with sunshine, drinking and time with friends.  it all started out with ladies night at the i-ho on friday.  it's been a long time since i've gotten completely drunk and that night sorta made me miss partying like it's 1999.  here's a little tip for you boys: if a girl tells you that she has a boyfriend, do not a.)ask her why she's out dancing and then b.)proceed to tell her that if you were her boyfriend, that you would not allow her to go out.  newsflash asshole:  that's why you're not my boyfriend.  p.s., and you smell funny.  saturday night was a semi-repeat of friday night, but substantially more toned down.  had dinner with judes, mish and ryan, which was nice, since i haven't seen my brown brotha in awhile.  we (minus ryan) then headed over to escape for some heat.  actually, it wasn't that bad, better than last week.  beats sitting at home!  since sunday was father's day, we did up the family time and just kinda spent the whole day doing a whole lotta nothing.  after dinner, i watched 50 first dates for the second time...ohiluvit!  i'm a sucker for the chick flicks.  i've gotta go work out like a madwoman this week in order to make up for the binging of this past weekend AND prepare for the upcoming one.  i feel like i've gained about 4 pant sizes and it's not a pleasant feeling when you have to sit behind a desk 5 days out of the week.  anyhoo, lunchtime is upon me, so i'm outta heeeeeeah!

      i decided to start one of these things due to my lack of work while being at work.  i remember doing this sorta thing back in the day when i used to have an angelfire page and actually CARED about doing something with it.  wow, that was a long time ago.   i'm going to try and NOT turn this into a bitchfest, so i'm going to get this out of the way early.  i hate my job, strongly dislike my supervisor and need to find a new one that pays good money.  that's all :)  anybody hiring a psych major with an interest in human resource management?    anyway, in all the downtime that i've been experiencing at work, i've been doing a lot of thinking about all sorts of things, and i had a lot of material that i wanted to yak about, but i'm coming to a blank at this time, so there isn't going to be any deep discussions about life today, just surface stuff.  so it's friday, my favourite day of the week and the sun is shining.  i've got plans with some of the girls for a late dinner and an outing to the iron horse afterwards for some non-heaty fun, so i'm pretty excited.  as we get older and our schedules less synchronized, it's getting harder and harder for me and my friends to get together for something as simple as coffee, so i really treasure any time that we get to spend together now.    the rest of my weekend has been left open.  saturday might be workout day since i should have recooperated by then.  after my intense 2 hour workout the other day, my body parts are still aching and i've got the biggest knot in the middle of my back...that goes to show how really out of shape i am.  father's day is on sunday and i still haven't gotten my dad anything, but i'm leaning towards the golf pass just cuz i'm uncreative and lazy :/    it's hard to think of interesting things to say when your brain turns to mush.  can i get a little stimulation here please?  thanks.  anyway, perhaps i will try to pretend to work, so i'm out for now.  call me if you're bored!  email me if you're bored!  i like people :D  hahaha

      my oh my, it's been awhile since i've blogged!&nbsp; quite a bit has happened since then tho...for those of you who've been living under a rock and don't know,   ANDREW AND I ARE ENGAGED  !!&nbsp; yes, it's crazy, yes it's true, and no,&nbsp;i couldn't be any more happy and excited :)&nbsp; it happened on july 21, 2004 and he proposed to me at the legislature, completely to my surprise.&nbsp; i'm glad it worked out the way that it did tho cuz i think that the engagement is ten times more exciting when you don't plan it out to the last little detail.&nbsp; the next couple hours after the actual event were filled with "OMIGOD!", "ARE YOU SERIOUS?!", "YA RIGHT!!", "SHADDUP, FOR REAL?!" and "AAAAAH!!!!!"...it was great!&nbsp; haha it's fantastic to know that all of my friends are just as excited about it as i am.&nbsp; we haven't gotten many details worked out yet, but we know that the wedding won't be until at least 2006, most likely in august, and it will be held in etown.&nbsp; more news to come later!  andrew and i have just been chillin and hanging out for the past couple weeks, doing "regular" couple-y things, just cuz we can.&nbsp; if i had a nickel for everytime i heard how difficult long distance relationships were, i'd be able to quit this god awful job and buy the damn company!&nbsp; however, i think our situation just goes to show that no matter how hard things get, love will prevail in the end.&nbsp; yes, that quite possibly could have been the cheesiest thing that has ever come out of my mouth (and trust me, i spit out a lot of cheese), but at the same time, one of the truest.&nbsp; our relationship is anything but conventional, but i think that because of the distance, we've actually gotten closer to eachother in the past year than most couples&nbsp;do in a lifetime.&nbsp; since we're forced to talk to eachother everyday in order to sustain the relationship, we've been able to learn a lot of things about eachother in a short period of time...i couldn't be more grateful for the invention of the internet and the telephone :)  anyway, enough of that mush, back to the real world and your regularly scheduled programming.&nbsp; i played in my first poker tournament last night and surprisingly made a couple dollars before getting booted out, but i quite enjoyed the experience.&nbsp; i'm hoping to be able to organize a girly poker night where we can sit around, smoke cigars and scratch our balls.&nbsp; aaaaaah...any takers?

      it's the monday post&nbsp;birthday and i'm feeling pretty good despite lacking some sleep.&nbsp; saturday evening was fantastic, much like last year.&nbsp; thanks again everybody for coming out and celebrating with me :)&nbsp; i'm working on getting the pictures scanned...but y'all know how quickly i tend to move on these things. &nbsp; work sucks again.&nbsp; i went from having my own private office where i was free to fart and burp without disturbing anybody, to being out in the open, right in front of the vp's office...where i suppose i could still fart and burp freely at the risk of losing my job.&nbsp; hrm, what to do...AH you only live once!&nbsp; haha just kidding :) &nbsp; &nbsp;

      freakin eh, the big muther of a fly i had disposed of a couple weeks ago has come back go bug me (no pun intended).  looks like i'm gonna be spending the afternoon fly hunting again.  must go put on proper hunting gear.  i spent a large portion of this morning trying to recooperate from the weekend.  somehow it's a lot harder to do in front of a computer at the office than it is in my own bed.  despite the lack of sleep tho, the trip down to the stampede was worth it.  it's always so much more fun being inebriated in a city other than your own.  something about the new surroundings i guess?  speaking of guess, it's a good thing i stopped working there, cuz they were right in the middle of all that flooding at wem.  on the one hand, it sucks, but on the other, i have to laugh cuz i easily could have been one of the people working yesterday.  HAHA mutha sukkas!  countdown to le pubcrawl... 5 days !  and on a final note, tomorrow's andrew day.  yay! :)

      rawr, i hate rain.  i hate how it makes everything smell like wet cats.  i hate driving in the big puddles that make my car do funny things.  i hate that it makes me grumpy and sleepy.  blah!  it'd better get better by saturday or i'm gonna have to get extra drunk on saturday night to make up for it ruining my stampede experience.  aah yes, booze is the solution to everything :D  on the bright side of things, while i was at work yesterday, i received a delivery of flowers from the best boyfriend EVAH!!  thanks bub, the bear has made my drab office not so drab anymore.  now i have a friend to talk to!  this week has flown by surprisingly quickly.  it's canadian idol night already!  i've noticed that since quitting my second job, i have a lot more extra time to indulge in television watching and there's a lot of surprisingly good stuff on the boob tube during the week!  i've got my weeknights planned out for the next couple weeks: -monday: for love or money -tuesday: the amazing race and/or big brother -wednesday: canadian idol -thursday: canadian idol results show, csi re-runs, big brother, will and grace -friday: luckily i haven't been home to find out oh my, i need to find a hobby.  finally, this is just a public service announcement.  BUY PUBCRAWL TICKETS PLEASE!  so far all the responses i've gotten so far are ones telling me that people can't come.  i need people to celebrate with!  kthnxbye!

      yay for canada day...shortened work weeks rock.  at this time next week i will be getting pumped about heading down to calgary for the stampede.  i've never been down there for the stampede before, but i've heard that it's supposed to be SO much better than kdays, so it will prove to be an interesting experience.  it's been awhile since i've gone on any sort of road trip with my buddies, should be a good time!  in the past couple weeks, i've been spending my time at work looking for a new job and have landed a couple interviews.  sometimes when my supervisor comes and say stuff to me about what will be happening in the upcoming months, i feel kinda bad cuz she obviously has no idea as to how much i really despise my job.  actually, it surprises me that i haven't been fired yet cuz i'm late almost every morning, and i've been busted on msn before.  i must be a good pretend worker!  haha  the fly extermination in my office continues...the body count is now up to 3.  i think i caught the big monster one today.  it was flying around really slowly today, i think i might have knocked something loose last time when i hit it with the back of my fat hand.  TAKE THAT MUTHA SUKKA!  don't mess :P

      yummies, i've been gorging on 2 bite brownies all week, thanks to save-on's 2/$1 deal this week. it's been a baaaad week for junk food. i've got pringles and wine gums stashed in my desk at work too. oh boy.  i've been neglecting my blog lately, not on purpose, but really just cuz i haven't had much time. it's weird how it feels like i got more done when i used to work 2-3 jobs than i do now working just 1 job. maybe i've just gotten lazier tho, i sure do watch a lot more television than i used to.  about two weeks ago, i went camping for the first time EVAR and it actually wasn't a horrible experience, which was surprising. no bears, minimal bugs, and good company made it easier for me to deal with the stank i produced as a result of not showering :) just kidding, i smelled like roses...it was only for 2 days. haha  the wedding planning has sorta begun. andrew and i are starting to look for reception sites, so if anybody has any ideas or suggestions, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know. thanks and iluvoyuall.
