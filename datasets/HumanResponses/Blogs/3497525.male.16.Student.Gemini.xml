         Because of the Football,  The Sleepover Club , is no longer being shown.  Pevee wants to make a petition. But I said, let them have their Football, not like they going to win.

      My absense has been because of a heavy dosage of anthetmines that I took when i found out they weren't new episode.  BUT NOW I KICKED THE HABIT!  I attended lynny rhodes drug clinic, and all is well now.  to show my disgust to CITV i present you with the "council estate ugly sleepover gals"

      Pevee is really sorry about his posts (ie. the lack of them). I have asked him to post tomorrow.  But I can just feel it in my bones, that I will have to badger him.

      I watched "the sleepover club" for the first time today, and at the risk of pevee killing her self, it was nothing special.

      CITV seem to be pretty good at the storytelling. They have tried to make it "sound", like the episodes they are currently broadcasting, are from some  new  series.  They are infact just repeating the previous series, which they have already shown. I can also say that, because of this  Pevee  has been very upset, and has not felt able to write a review.

      Yes! Only a few hours to go now.  We cannot wait, I am sure  Pevee  will post a review, as soon as the episode has been broadcasted.  Although he may need a few minutes, "private" time.
