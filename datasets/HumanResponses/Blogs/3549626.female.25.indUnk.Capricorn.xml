      Firstly, thank you to everyone for your comments.  They really do mean a great deal to me, especially on the posts that reveal so much about me.  I invested a lot of my heart in that post and now I want to explain the reason and the meaning behind it.  When I was younger, I had an eating disorder.  I was anorexic.  What I wrote was intended as a means to relate to people the complexities involved inside the head of somebody suffering that kind of illness.    It was inspired quite a long time ago.  I was in the early stages of coming out of the prison, and listening to the sound of wings beating.  I was out with a man that meant a lot to me, we were in a pub having a drink discussing life.  Somehow the conversation got around to eating dissorders.  He told me...  "I don't have any sympathy for people like that!"  I asked why he felt that way, and he responded  "Well, it's just vanity isn't it."  He didn't know about my problem or how much it hurt.  At the time I simply said that 'it was about feeling so unbearably sad that you don't know what else to do'.  He disagreed but dropped the subject.  A comment like that can do untold damage and I thought 'I wish I could make you see, and make you feel how much it hurts'.    And so that is what that post was for and I think, from my own personal experience that I've done it justice. It would be interesting if other sufferers could offer an opinion of it because I'm sure that everyones experience is different.  As for the, two sides of the coin, the coin is symolic of my mind at the time.  It was one coin but split down the middle and you're hearing both sides.  I could have just as easily been Yin and Yang, but I decided to go with the coin.    Again, I thank you all for reading it and leaving me comments.  It was so touching that you cared enough.

       Heads   Imagine looking into the hollow and empty eyes of somebody you hate. You hate them more than words can even begin to describe. You despise the way they look, how fat they are, how ugly. You want them to suffer, you wish that they were dead and yet, at the same time you are terrified at the prospect of your wish being granted.   Every little thing they do irritates you more than fingernails on a chalkboard. The sound of their voice, the way their nose seems to obscure their face. The fact that they are, in your opinion, essentially useless.   Fortunately for you, you have a degree of control over this person. Each morning you look at them and affirm they are too fat, a horrible person, unworthy of affection. Little by little, you start to take away their food until they barely eat at all anymore.   They’re still as fat and repulsive as they ever were. Their cheeks are hollowed, their complexion grey and the whites of their eyes a stinging red from crying all day. This just adds to your disgust and annoys you more, making them feel worse and cry more.  They look longingly into fridge’s, freezers, cupboards, supermarket shelves. Torturing themselves with longing. Aching for just one piece of cake, a bar of chocolate, a bowl of pasta, a peanut butter sandwich, peace of mind.  You won’t allow that. They’re fat enough already.  You twist things around in their head until they don’t know which way is up or if left is right or right is left or the other way around. You convince them that food is fat and fat is despicable.   If they eat, they will become even more unlovable.  You watch as day by day, week by week, the person you are looking at starts to look blurred at the edges. No longer the same person you once despised but a stranger you both loathe and fear, a wreck that you have created.   You follow them around none the less, screaming abuse at every quiet moment, never letting them forget how disgusting they are. Reciting, like a public service announcement, the calorific content of whatever you see them dreaming about.  They become smaller and smaller. You continue your torrent of abuse.  They pray for peace, for acceptance, for love.  You shout louder to hide the sound of their silent plea to heaven.  There will be no peace until one of you is dead.    Or Tails    Imagine a life, craving stillness and acceptance. You don’t know what you’ve done to deserve what’s happening to you. You cry yourself to sleep every night and wake up the next day, spent, and tired, sore from your tears and dizzy from starvation.   And there is a person that won’t leave you alone. Your heart is breaking as they tell you constantly, each day, that you are nothing.   You didn’t want to believe them at first, but over time they wore down your defences and shouted loud enough for it to sink in. They made it impossible for you to ignore.  “You’re UGLY” “No” You sob gently. “You’re FAT and UGLY” “No” You cry louder. “You’re FAT and UGLY and NOBODY will ever care about or want you. You worthless waste of space”. “No, please” You collapse to your knees. “Yes!” And so you accept the words as truth.  You walk alone with your tormentor. Each day is an invisible prison that you fell into one day, through a crack in the pavement. You were distracted by all the noise and didn’t see the gap and now you’re stuck. Darkness surrounds you. There is a crack in the ceiling that you think you remember, but you’re seeing it from a different angle. Light shines in. You don’t know how to reach it and so you stop looking up.  Inside you are broken. You want to be loved so desperately, you want to be held, and you want to be good and worthy.  But still, this person that won’t leave you alone follows you and taunts you and reminds you of your loneliness and your uselessness.  There are no words strong enough to explain the hurt you feel. When attempting to eat you are faced with a barrage of abuse and nothing you say or do can quell it.  You pray every day for peace, for an ending to this cruelty. You are weak from grief.   You try to scream, to make heaven hear you, for anyone to hear you. Your tormentor just shouts louder and you fear you will remain unheard and unnoticed forever.  There will be no peace until one of you is dead.    A Happy Ending   Imagine an Angel hears a prayer from a heartbroken soul. It comes through as a whisper and the Angel struggles to catch the words. This soul is lost in the dark corridors of its own imaginings and is hard to reach because there are a thousand different voices competing to be heard.  The Angel is calling to the soul to come to it. Just for a second, to ignore what will not be ignored. To find the strength within to turn away and look in a different direction.  For a long time the soul is too afraid. Though this person is cruel they are familiar and the soul has come to trust what they tell it. It is convinced they are right.  But the Angel won’t give in. Each day it whispers a soft promise that things will be okay if only the soul can trust it.  And, upon each promise, a little faith grows and pulls the soul a little further away from the source of its misery. The voice of the one that hates it, though still present, is quieter. The soul can hear its own thoughts again and the soft sound of wings beating. And it makes it pivot around to see what’s out there.  And that turn was all that the Angel was waiting for, as it picks up the soul and lifts it out of its self imposed prison, back through the crack in the pavement and back into the world that it had forgotten existed. And the voice stayed down in the prison and the Angel carried the soul until it was strong enough to walk again. And they have been walking together ever since.

      Herb mentioned in a comment on my previous post that he had noticed a lack of people in the words I wrote.  If the truth be told it hadn't even occurred to me but now that it's been pointed out I can see what he means.  To remedy that I'd like to tell you about one of the dear cherished people that I’m lucky enough to know.  This person is somebody that I got to know during the time I worked in a supermarket on the customer service desk.  She was, at the time, a seen year old girl.  Now she is nine.  She is beautiful, with a smile that lights up my heart every time I see her.  She likes to act in her school plays she likes her music, and being 'cool'.  She's changing each time I see her from a girl to a young lady, eager to be a teenager before her time.  She is endearing and special, kind and generous and has the most angelic heart imaginable.  Every time her mum would come in to do her shopping this girl would wander over to stand beside my desk and talk to me during the brief moments that my head wasn’t spinning around while I hurried in a thousand different directions trying to get things done. No matter how busy I was I would always find or make five minutes to stop and have a chat and we became firm friends.  She would tell me about her week at school, her friends, hr latest crush and whatever else was on her mind. I would listen keenly and tell her about the fun things that had happened that day.  As time went by I began buying her and her brothers gifts at Christmas time and for their birthdays.  She would bring me beautiful pictures that she had drawn, which to this day still sit proudly on my wall.  After working at the supermarket for 8 years, I decided it was time to move on.  I knew it would be hard and that I would miss every single friend I had made out of my customers and colleagues but I needed to see what else I was capable of.  Both she and I were upset on my last day.   I gave her a CD by her favourite pop group as an “I’m going away present”, she gave me a framed picture of her and her brother and I cried a lot.  I gave her my phone number and a card telling her how special she was and that if she ever wanted to talk to me she could always give me a call.  About a month after I started my new job I receive a text message from her mum, asking if I’d like to meet up with them for a cuppa somewhere which I did.  It has now become a frequent occurrence.  We sit and talk like in the good old days, only, without the separating presence of the desk.  Next month, as a treat, I am taking her to see a concert with the group whose CD I gave her.  It will be a very special day I’m sure.  Friendships can be found in the most obscure places, but when you think about it, a supermarket isn’t that obscure at all.

      I was unsure about just how open I wanted to be in this little journal of mine.  I thought long and hard before writing this, but eventually, I decided to just go for it.  Finding a starting point is difficult, I’m not sure exactly what it is I want to say.  Forgive me if I ramble.  Love is a word with a thousand meanings, each of them unique, yet each of them essentially coming from the same place.  It’s a word that can be thrown about carelessly and easily lose all meaning.  This isn’t what I want to say and these aren’t the words I’m feeling for.  Let me instead start by telling you candidly about myself.    I am 25 years old and have never embarked up the daring challenge that people call a ‘serious relationship’, at least not a lasting one.  I have had a few brief encounters, a heartbreaking desire for somebody that didn’t return the sentiment and a short relationship that didn’t work. And just lately, I have been deeply missing human contact.  The feeling of skin against skin and lips against lips the touch of another person, a hand caressing my cheek.  Just being held.  But I don’t give myself away easily.  When I say myself, I mean my heart; if somebody captures that, I would give them the rest of myself gladly.   I have only slept with one man.  It seems like such a long time ago that it feels like I may never have the experience again.  I have to wonder, what is so fundamentally different, or just plain wrong with me, that I have such trouble opening up to people.  I’m afraid that they won’t like me when they get to know me, that I’ll bore them, that they’ll find me empty, or that they’ll simply reject me.  I know that if I ever want to have a relationship with somebody then I’ll have to get over that fear.  I used to think I was terribly ugly, both inside and out.  Those feelings have passed and I no longer have any hang ups about my appearance.  There’s just this tiny voice inside me that whispers every now and again that I’m not enough, better to stay alone by choice than to risk having it imposed upon me.    And of course, there is the physical aspect of things.  I worry that due to my lack of experience I will not be good enough.    Please don’t think I’m being vulgar here, I’m trying to be open and not worry about vulnerability.  It isn’t easy.

      The sea air remains in my hair, giving me a windswept appearance.  A few grains of golden sand tickle my feet as they cling to them and my skin glows with a soft and subtle tan that isn't anything special but is sufficient to please me.  My holiday is over.  I have returned to a grey sky and spatters of quenching rain on the window.  The air is cool but not unpleasant, the Seagulls are noticeable by their absence and, barring the small pile of unopened letters that await my attention, everything is exactly as it was before I left.  It is as if I had never been away.  But I have, and how I know it.  If there is one thing that can renew and restore the deepest part of me it is the ocean. Its vastness, the continuance of the waves as they rise and fall and never falter, the untamed passion that it possesses and a thousand other attributes make the ocean what it is, and make it so dear to me.  While I was away, I didn’t write very much at all.  I thought a great deal about many things. But the beach is no place for thought and each one only stayed a while before drifting off like clouds above the shore.  I was happy to see them go.  Something I came to realise about myself is that I think too much, and worry too much.  It was lovely to relax and how could I not.  One of the nicest places I visited was called Looe.    Grassy cliffs enclosed the beach on either side.  One side grassy and wild, the other, a collection of picturesque houses nestling amidst lush green trees.   I sat on the sand that was as soft as lemon sherbet and almost as yellow.  Glistening specks of gold caught the sunlight giving the appearance of diamonds on the sand.    The soft muffled sound of gulls crying and children playing were hidden against the breath of the oceans breaking waves.  I found myself inhaling and exhaling with it and felt myself calm down and it occurred to me how easily we can forget how to breathe.  The water was a deep silvery-indigo that extended further than a naked eye could see, and further than a beach-swept mind could dream.  In the shallowest part of the water a few small boulders sat, like a perfect after-thought, painted on by the omnipresent artist that and envisioned this scene.  Tiny waves broke against the sand, white foam rose and fell and disappeared as quickly as it came.  The sun caught on every ripple, every crest, all the way back to the darker more inky water on the horizon, a soft focused dividing line dotted with boats set against clouds.   The clouds were white and silver and blue, blended together and looking like a mountain.  The sky higher up was the colour of Angelite rock, soft and blue and gracefully flawed with the milky streaks of white cloud floating on its surface.  And the warmth of the sun finished the scene, embracing me like a warm hug from a cherished friend.  I could have stayed forever. Some of the fleeting thoughts I did have, surprised me, challenged me and amazed me, but I’m glad that I didn’t spend too much time writing while I was away, because I would have missed so much.  No, far better to have indulged in the simple pleasures of reflecting and doing nothing much else.          urlLink    Me by the sea&nbsp; urlLink     For some reason, when I'm on holiday, I lose the desire to wear a mask of makeup, so this is me in unashamed nakedness(By the way, in case anyone wondered, the other person in the picture is my dad, but I cut him out because he doesn't like the idea of his picture on the net.    urlLink    Deep dark thoughts&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    Pondering the clouds&nbsp; urlLink     This is a few clouds that I thought were particularly lovely.

      I gave you my everything, you gave it back, You said I was all of the things that you lack, You said I was good, And you said I was pure,  Then you said that you couldn’t love me anymore.  You once said my touch had the power to heal, And oh how I wanted those words to be real, Then you kissed me, And I heard you mournfully sigh, ‘I will love you forever, but forever goodbye’.  And I can’t deny it, and I cannot hide, The day that you left me, a part of me died, You were all that I wanted, And then you were gone, And I was expected to just carry on.  Well my love, I still love you and I always will. There’s a space left inside me I know I can’t fill, My sweet love,  When you held me the pain went away, You kept all the demons and monsters at bay.  But now all of the pretty words, that you once said, Are just watered down memories and just about dead, For your love was illusion,  Just smoke in my eyes, So I’ll love you forever, but forever goodbye.

      My name is Inky, and I am a bookaholic. It’s been 24 hours since I bought my last book.    I just couldn’t help myself.  It is as if I am compelled, by an unseen force of nature, to fill my life with the printed word.  The trouble is, it’s not just my life that’s getting filled, it’s the space that surrounds me and I’m running out of room.  I adore everything about books, each and every aspect of them, old and new.  Old books are like old friends.  Familiar, reassuring and there when you need to turn to them.  They welcome you with open arms at a moment’s notice and walk you down the path you know so well to the world you’ve visited so often.   They never tire of seeing you and always offer you something different, something that you hadn’t seen before, because your mind was looking in a different direction.    And new books, are just as magical, a world of potential bound between the covers. The crisp feeling of new pages, their texture, the way they crackle as they turn.  The scent of the ink, the way it is so untainted, vibrant and infinite in what it might hold.  Every page is an unexplored terrain, waiting to be discovered, and a friend you’ve yet to meet.  There’s just something so beautifully comforting and exquisitely exciting about the unspoken promises of words on a page.

      Whenever I see those beautiful, crystalline beams of sunlight that bust through the thickest, most solid clouds and flow down to earth I think of heaven.   I think of love, joy, and peace and I feel as though I might burst. And if I did burst, I think I would fill the world with purple petals, silver glitter, pink butterflies and shining white light and all the love in the world.  Because in those moments that’s all I can think of, pure love.  And such is the miracle of nature.  There is so much beauty in the world if you chose to see it, so when I say heaven, I don't necessarily mean the place we go once we're done with this life. I mean here, I mean now.  There is astounding, delicious grace in every hidden corner of the world, in you, in me, in the old man that lives at the end of the road.    The first flowers of spring, the first warm day of the summer, the first leaf to fall in the autumn and the first snowfall of the winter.   The smile of a baby, a sugary pink rose, the sound of a light-weight aeroplane gliding across the sky in the glorious deep heat of summer.   The cool feeling of river water trickling past your toes as you hang your bare feet carelessly over the bank, while fish dart about beneath you, almost close enough to touch.  Dogs barking, children laughing, the smell of rain, there is so much to be thankful for, so much to be inspired by if we only know where to look.    And sometimes I forget to look up and see the rainbows and the stars, and smell the flowers and the freshly cut grass, and feel the morning dew on my naked feet.   But when I do remember, when I’m reminded, and the golden light of heaven looks down and whispers to me of how lucky I am, my heart is filled up and I am so grateful.

      Today I came home from work with a migraine and it made me appreciate my health.  Very often I tend to forget to be thankful for feeling well.  A clear head is just something to see through, but a foggy painful head is something that can reduce you to tears.  I slept the afternoon away and when I woke up, I felt clear again and ready to face tomorrow.    Thank you God for my health.

      The acorn held on with all of his might, afraid of the distance to fall. He just wasn't ready to take his flight, No, he just wasn't ready at all.  The task up ahead seemed enormously big, And he didn't know he could get through it. So he used all his strength to cling on to his twig, and he prayed he'd be able to do it.  But then the wind blew, and it blew so much, that the acorn let go of his tree. And he fell through the air, once he'd loosened his clutch Then he thought, 'Wow, I'm finally free'.  The acorn fell down from the old oak tree, and the fall hadn't fractured his shell. And he thought to himself, 'Though I'm only a seed, inside, I'm an oak tree as well!"

      I'm back from the chaos of the weekend.  I landed with a bump.  Due to working Saturday, my weekend has consisted of yesterday evening and today.    Saturday started, as most of my mornings tend to, in Starbucks.  The time between waking up and arriving there is a hazy blur.  Work was a fast rush of problems that melted at the edges to form one giant problem that was seemingly unsolvable.  Fortunately, no problem is ever as unsolvable as it first might appear and I found that breathing through it helped immensely.  The main problem was how busy we were, everything after that, merely details.  After work was over I got on a bus and went to see my best friend and her family.  We had a nice time, chatting and catching up and I got to see the kittens that will soon be my babies!   Did I mention her cat had kittens? Well, her cat had kittens.  Three to be exact and I'm having 2 of them.  Her daughter is keeping the third as company for the mother cat so it's all good.  As yet, I don't have any names.  I'll post some pictures later of the little bundles of joy so you can get aquainted.  I'll write more later.

       urlLink I took the Tickle Ink Blot personality test, just to see what it said and it was quite accurate!    Inky, your subconscious mind is driven most by Peace   You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world.  You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment.   Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others.   Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Peace, there is much more to who you are at your core.

      The window of the old and tarnished shop, Holds lost forgotten memories of the faceless.  Pots and vases, tins and books and frames, Seek refuge in this shelter for the placeless.  A teapot made of fine, chipped porcelain. Sits gracefully with peeked anticipation. The clinks and chinks that yesteryear did bring, Echo in times invisible vibration.  A fragile, meek, abandoned china doll, Whose name and past have swiftly been surrendered, Rests in a satin dress upon a chair, And waits for a time when she might be remembered.  What kind of person gave these treasures up? Whose hands once lifted up that little pot?  Whose arms had held that little doll so dear? Then sent her to the shop the world forgot.

      The sky is cloudless and perfectly blue. Undisputedly blue like that of a brand new watercolour in a child’s paint-box.  The sun shines with warm affection and whispers to the hearts of the living that today is a good day to be alive. People walk around relaxed, calm, eyes to the sky saying silent prayers of thanks for the respite they have been granted from winter’s hostility.  Nobody notices as a lonely cloud drifts across the canvass lost and alone, nor do they notice a second, or third. But suddenly, and nobody knows quite when or why, everyone is aware of the change in this picture. A strange yellow-grey shroud of light and darkness encircles everyone and everything.   The air grows colder and peoples pace begins to quicken. Mother’s fumble clumsily with oversized plastic rain covers for pushchairs and prams. And then the first fat, juicy raindrops are thrown aimlessly from the sky.   Splash. Splash. Splash.  “It’ll make it’s mind up one day” say the people to each other, not one of them believing their own words.  Splash. Splash. Splash.  “Lovely weather for ducks though”. Not true. The ducks don’t mind either way. They hardly come into town after all, and their pond is always full.  Splash. Splash. Splash.  The rain doesn’t care.  It doesn’t care about Suzy’s new shoes, or Greg’s new shirt. It doesn’t care about picnic lunches or trips to the park. The concrete is thirsty and eager to receive the rain  The sky grows darker and the pigeons disappear to that mysterious place that pigeons disappear to in the wet weather. People have stopped looking to the sky and now look to each other and then the ground. Their pace quickens into a puddle dodging run.   Clack. Clack. Clack Clack. Clack Clack Clack.   Every now and then,  Splish.   A shoe goes down in a blaze of glory.  The rain keeps falling, harder now. It is impossible to hear each raindrop.   Splash. Splash. Splash replaced with an endless ‘shhhhhhhhhhhhhh’  The pavement is alive, running like mercury down the street and dancing under the recycled soup of ponds and rivers and a pinch of the sea (for flavour).  The colour drains from every face until all that remains are grey shells with water dripping into their eyes and from the end of their noses.   Shhhhhhhhh.  Children are hurried along, dragged by their arms but still striving to reach each puddle.  Shops and cafes fill up quickly with wet refugees.   “I’ll buy a coffee if you let me stay.”  Windows cloud up and the air becomes thick, warm and wet as the steam begins to rise off of each drenched body. Small gaps appear in the condensation, made by clammy hands, to let tired minds watch the rain and wait for it all to be over.  And then, as quickly as it started,   The   Shhhhhhhhhh  Becomes a   Splash. Splash. Splash.  And the  Splash. Splash. Splash.  Becomes a  Drip. Drip. Drip.  And the pigeons come back, and the colour returns to the scene and to people’s faces. The sun shines down with warm affection once more.   And all that remains from the last ten minute are a few little puddles, slowly rising..

      In bed last night I wallowed in the stale feeling of shallow regret.  The dream fairy bought me a nightmare that left me chilled to my core.    I dreamt of a wedding that hadn’t happened yet, but could not be avoided.  It was my own.  I was getting married to somebody I didn’t love because I didn’t want to hurt his feelings.  How this had come to happen I don’t know.  All I knew was I was on course to spend the rest of my life with someone I couldn’t stand to be around and it made me feel physically sick with worry about what I was going to do.    Things happened on the way to this wedding.  Cars didn’t turn up so needed to be chased up.  Food wasn’t ready.  I was merely an observer, waiting for my sentence.   And then the dreaded moment had arrived.  I was stood in an ivory dress in a green garden with concrete paths.  There at the altar was the one I had to marry.  I felt angry, trapped and dead.    And then I woke up, the dream had passed but the emotions lingered on.  Now, I don’t have a partner, and so am not likely to be marrying anyone any time soon but the dream made sense in a lot of ways.  The fear of making a wrong decision and ruining a perfectly good life is valid, whether it is in love, work, or otherwise. And lately I have been frustrated at work, and of course I’m tired of being single and I’m realising now that it’s affecting me more than I realised.

      I spent the afternoon in the garden, befriending the frogs that live in my pond.  They're shy little creatures and quite adorable.  One of them, that I decided to call Wilbur (and I sincerely hope he didn't mind), sat on my hand for a good few minutes and we discussed the greater mysteries of life.    Frogs are quite wise little creatures with big hearts and friendly coppery eyes. If you treat them with respect they will return the sentiment.  I am now very enlightened.  Other things I have done today include, going to town to buy a few clothes for my upcoming holiday.  I will be going to Cornwall for a week and I can't wait.  Just to be near the ocean will be enough, but there is so much more there than that!  I got a nice yellow skirt with bright red flowers around the bottom, a yellow vest to wear it with, a blue dress to wear on the beach, and out shopping and a couple of little tops.  I might post a couple of pictures at some point in the near future as my description does not do them justice.  Finally, a poem (as I am a poet too for those that don't know and have had one piece published).  Sing  Life is just a song we sing, Sometimes the words don't rhyme. But sing it with your heart and soul, down to the closing line.  Don't be afraid to shout out loud,  To dance to your own tune, To sing to every friend you make, In everything you do.  The bridge may be romantic, Or a soothing lullaby, Or exciting, filled with passion, Or a tearful, soulful sigh.  It hurts and it is wonderful, There's joy and sorrow too. It rings out loud throughout the world, This song, composed by you.  Relax and let your heart sing, Breathe in and take your time. It doesn't matter honey, That the words don't always rhyme.

      It always seems easier to write at the weekends.  Time is more generously distributed in my direction. I don't have to rush like wildfire from my bed in a desperate battle to reach the bus.    Today, I decided to take advantage of the bus-ride and scribble through the empty moments.  08.10am Today is yellow. A golden sun fills up every inch of space with heat and the heat is palpable and thick. It's like moving through a caramel soup; delicious and sticky and impossible to rush.  08.30am Morning coffee. The air conditioning is broken in Starbucks.  It does not make for happy customers.  I on the other hand am carrying on with my caramel theme by indulging in an iced caramel latte.  A yellow butterfly flutters past the window.  The clouds in the sky are wispy and stretched, like gentle waves breaking on a beach.  12.30pm Lunchtime. An elderly, homeless man is standing opposite the place where I work, playing a guitar that possess not a single string. Dancing to the music in his head, a song with a silent melody.  In this sweltering, blistering heat he stands there wrapped in a winter coat and jumper, apparently oblivious to his surroundings.  3 bags, perhaps containing all of his worldly possessions, sit beside him. How did he come to end up like that.  Where are the people to love him?  The caramel from this morning has melted away it seems, into an imperceptible clear haze that gives an accent to how dehydrated everything is. Even the breeze is warm, I can't help but revel in the soup.  7.45pm The day is over, the sun is setting, the air is cooling.   What a beautiful day.

      Well, the day has been and gone.  The sun has gone down, the moon has risen and the heat of the day has not diminished one tiny bit.   Tonight I will sleep without my covers and dream of tropical places.  Places with crimson skies and cool deep oceans, warm air and damp sand.  Where mermaids sit on rocks, against the dusk, combing their hair while the gentle breeze soothes their skin and the sun dies another death.    Sweet dreams everybody.

      So, I decided to make Malted Chocolate Slices.  Firstly, I took these things...  100g Butter 2 tbsp golden (corn) syrup 2 tbsp Malted choc drink 225g Malted milk biscuits 75g milk or dark choc 25g icing (confectioners) sugar 2 tbsp milk  or...   urlLink    Ingredients&nbsp; urlLink     Then, I did these things...  Grease a 7” baking tin.  Melt in a pan the butter, malted chocolate drink powder, and golden syrup until combined together.  Crush the biscuit into crumbs and then stir into the melted yumminess until it is all nice and sticky.  Pour into the baking tin and press down until it’s nice and firm, then put into the fridge to set.  Once it’s all cool and set, break the chocolate into pieces and place in a bowl with the icing sugar and milk.   Place the bowl in a pan of water and melt over a low heat.  Pour and spread the chocolate goo onto the malted biscuit base and spread it evenly.  Put back into the fridge to set.  What I ended up with was this   urlLink    Finished Product&nbsp; urlLink     And it was yummy.

      After a morning spent in the great outdoors, revellng in nature and all of her gifts I spent an afternoon doing something quite the oposite.    My brother, his girlfriend and I all went to the pictures.  We watched the new Harry Potter and I have to say it was very good.  The time flew by, interupped only by unrelenting sound of children rustling their popcorn bags and noisily eating the contents.  All in all though, I was very pleased I went.    This evening I am going to be baking (sort of).  I'm making chocolate malted wedges and, although there is no actual baking involved, there is heating, stiring, bashing and icing a wide selection of ingredients.  I will post both the recipe and a picture of the finished product once the deed has been done so, brace yourselves.  That's if anyone is reading this of course.

      The sun shines beautifully outside, tapping on my window, beckoning me to come and play amongst it's rays.  Wisps of cotton clouds float carefree in the deep blue cradle that contains them.  The gentle hum of lawnmowers and lightweight aircraft fill the air and my ears.  The sweet, thick perfume of the sweet peas float gently on an almost unnoticable breeze.  Such a temptation is near impossible to resist.  I think I will go for a walk.

      My arms have just been scratched to ribbons by my brothers delightful cat 'Bluebell'.  What's worse is the fact that I'm allergic to cats so all the scratches have risen up into elongated hives.  It is not pretty, it itches like hell, and I bet they STILL expect me to feed them come morning!!!!    How can something so cute be so evil?

      Right now I'm trying to think of something interesting to say.  It shouldn't be this hard.  As you get to know me (should you decide to stick around) you'll get to know that I tend to live my life in hiding.  This isn't a good thing but it's true.  I am what I am and sometimes, I wish to god that I could change that person.    Fear has a wonderful way of keeping it's prisoners.  I wish that I could have a relationship and be prepared to let myself be judged instead of shying away from said judgments.  Better to have loved and lost they say, well, I've lost before loving.    I'm just a girl trapped in a woman's body, longing for something she'll probably never have.  The confidence to risk all of this nothing for everything.  Until such a moment comes to me though, or until I go to it, I will try to amuse myself with words.    Take me as I am or walk away.

      Nobody knows this blog is here.  It's a lonely little blog that wil stay lonely until it is discovered by those that come in search of it. Whether or not anyone does really remains to be seen but time will tell.    Currently I'm sat in my bed, clutching at my laptop spilling my guts onto this virtual paper, who knows what will become of it?  For now, I must get up and start doing things to write about later.  See you soon.

      Soft warmth surrounds me. Holds me. Floating through the peachy light, I’m drawn to you. Gently you touch me. I feel your breath against mine. I’m happy. It’s cold outside, But I don’t have a care in the world. Because you are here.  Inky

      Steam rises from my mug, like a wandering nomad. No destination but up. Nutmeg and cinnamon dance on the air like lovers on wet grass. I close my eyes and breathe deeply. Pictures of you fill my senses and my world. Heavy frost clings to the world outside. Winter is taking root inside this heart. But Nutmeg and Cinnamon will take the winter back, And thaw the coldness out. Old songs crackle and whirr in the background, setting the scene, Like a suicide note. And it would be so easy to just let go, To give up the fight, To slide away, Into silent oblivion. But I will always crave the sweetness, Of Nutmeg and Cinnamon. And so I keep holding on, For the promise of one last taste.  Inky

       And so the wind blows you, Where’s the harm? Though your path may change, You are still you.   And if you end up in a different place, To where you thought you’d be, It doesn’t matter, deep inside, You are still you.   So let the weather do its worst. Because battered by the wind, Or drenched by the rain, or burned by the sun, You are still you.   And nobody can take that away. Inky

      Today I met&nbsp;my friend Emma in Starbucks.&nbsp;We intented&nbsp;to&nbsp;go shopping for a bridesmaid dress for me to wear at her wedding next year.&nbsp; Unfortunately we found neither anything that we liked, nor that would fit me.&nbsp; It would have been wrong, however,&nbsp;to waste a perfectly good shopping day and so instead we attempted a mini-shopping-spree.&nbsp; This was far more sucsessful.&nbsp; Emma found herself a new handbag and&nbsp;I found a rather lovely dress and a gorgeous coat, both in the sale and both very yellow.&nbsp; I also found some new perfume which was half-price and a Anita Shreve's "Strange Fits Of Passion".&nbsp; My new dress looks fabulous, even if I do say so myself. It perhaps looks better on the hanger than it does on me though.&nbsp; I really don't mind, since it only cost me £5.00 Yes, you read that right.&nbsp; Originally it was £24.99 so quite the saving.&nbsp;  Assuming I can get some decent shots, I will post some pictures of my new things in the next few days.  I'm going back to the gym tomorrow after work for another workout.&nbsp; It's surprising how enjoyable exercise can be when you have the right mindset and I'm already starting to feel the difference.

      Thank you everyone for all your comments and emails.&nbsp; It's so nice to know I'm cared about.&nbsp;   One of the reasons I've not been updating is because I've been so busy.&nbsp; I joined a gym which is really fun, hopefully I'll still be thinking that in a few months.&nbsp; My big plan is to get fit and maybe a bit toned, but mainly fit.&nbsp; It's a ladies only gym which is good as I feel a lot more comfortable.&nbsp; I have quite a low self esteem when it comes down to it.&nbsp;  I've also been cat sitting for my neighbour, so I've been going over there with a hot drink and spending a bit of time with Dotty, just so she won't be lonely.&nbsp; I was only asked to go and feed her and let her in/out, but I just feel so bad for her, she's a gorgeous cat and oh so friendly.&nbsp; How could I not stay for a while?  When I get home from across the road, my little kittens start acting all odd because they can smell Dotty, it's a laugh a minute.  On tuesday night I went to the greyhound stadium with my work colleagues.&nbsp; That was pretty interesting.&nbsp; I've never been before but I won quite a bit.&nbsp; I say that, but I was only doing little bets so my winnings weren't excessive in amount, but they were in frequency.&nbsp; I think I must have some kind of spooky gift since I was just picking random numbers and hoping for the best.  Next Tuesday I have a beauty evening with my friend Caz, we're going to get made up and prettyfied :0D Should be good.  Well, I can't think of what else to say at the moment.&nbsp; Take care everyone.&nbsp; :-D I'll write about my workout on saturday.

      Well, it's been a while since I last updated.&nbsp; Mainly because I've been feeling quite icky and in no mood for writing.&nbsp; However, I feel better now and more like my old self.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's been quite an eventful week in the life of Inky.&nbsp; Despite feeling horrible and achy and ill, I went to work.&nbsp; We were short staffed and I'm certain it wasn't contagious.&nbsp; The week seemed to take longer than usual to pass by but to help it along I decided to fill it with a few fun things, one of which was, to enquire about joining a gym.&nbsp; And so I have an appointement on Monday to go and look round and see if I like it and then, all things being equal, I will join and get healthy.  &nbsp;  Other things I have done this week include buying the worlds most resilliant lipstick.&nbsp; It must be made of the same stuff they paint space ships with or something.&nbsp; It lasts all day and looks perfect until I take it off.&nbsp; This may not be the most amazing or astounding news ever, but it made me smile so I thought I'd share.  &nbsp;  Well, this hasn't been the most enlightening post, but at least it proves I'm still here.  &nbsp;  *hugs*  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Not to be taken seriously.  Recently, I've had something heavy weighing on my mind and it's got to the stage now, that if I don't talk about it I'll end up DOING something about it and ending up in prison.  Since I've started working in the town centre, I've spent at least five minutes of each lunch break trying to avoid and more worryingly sometimes, escape from, Clipboard vigilantes. It bothers me, it really does, that they are allowed to get away with it time after time. If it's not the market researchers it's the catalogue women, and if it's not the catalogue women it's the charity collectors. If it's not them, well you can rest assured there will be a Big issue (pronounced Gishoo) seller (officially recognised as an honorary clipboarder) there to try and hinder you in your quest to eat something before collapsing.   What is worse, is the fact that they all congregate outside where I work so I would either a) have to trip the fire alarm and escape via the roof, or b) find an invisibility cloak in order to get to my lunch break un-harrased.   Sometimes I pretend I am a special agent in order to make the whole ordeal a little bit more exciting and adventurous. Special Agent Inky with a mission to eat a sandwich in peace. Not very 'special' is it. Maybe, 'quite ordinary really when you think about it, agent, Inky' is more appropriate.   So, the first thing that a Quite Ordinary Really When You Think About It Agent, needs to do is research (non-market).  Know your enemy. We are mainly going to cover Market Researchers and Catalogue women here, though for details on the other two types of street pests, don't hesitate to ask me.   These creatures tend to wander in packs, using their clipboard as both a weapon and means of defence should the prey get too violent. They can be identified in several ways including, shiny anorak, high waisted trousers and bad haircuts from the 1980's (apologies to any clipboarders reading this) (apologies also to the 1980's, how were you to know). They have a very unusual kind of deafness, where basically they are unable to hear the word’s 'No' and 'I haven't got time'. They are usually aged from 50 to 56 and, though they might not look it, they can run like cheetahs.   So now you know how to spot them, you need to know what to do when they spot you (and believe me, they will).  I have done some research into this, and run a few tests, none of the tests were planned, they happened in shear desperation but amazingly, most of them were successful.  1. If you manage to clock them first, you have gained the upper hand. This is excellent news. Simply grab your mobile phone from your bag, place it against your ear and pray vocally that it doesn't ring. The clipboarders will mistake your conversation with god as a conversation with somebody of a more earthly persuasion and leave you alone. You won't look mad because you have a phone against your head and you can walk by unhindered, (if for whatever reason they do try and stop you, glare at them and mumble something about being late to meet your parole officer, then twitch a couple of times for effect). A word of warning – if your phone rings you WILL suffer permanent hearing damage.   2. Distract them with unexpected behaviour. If you see one coming towards you, use assertive body language to express your lack of desire to speak to them. I once tried the 'net-ball side step' manoeuvre that every teenage school girl seems to do when they're excited and the occasion calls for more than just jumping up and down on the spot. (Just an observation). If possible, make very definite 'oh no you don’t' sounds to confirm your feelings. Usually they will be so dumbfounded by your energy you will have the valuable seconds required to make a hasty exit from the scene and they will go on to cornering the next poor soul to wander their way without a crucifix.   3. Under NO circumstances should you EVER make eye contact. Once they're locked on to you you're history. It's like in topgun when the planes make the beepy noise and then all of a sudden it goes into one continuous beep and you know they're going to die. That's what it's like, so in summer months it's handy to wear sunglasses. Keep your head down if you must, or better yet, look straight ahead with a fixed and determined gaze in the direction you are walking. Should the clipboard wielding maniac approach you, turn your head as if you have just realised there is a shop on the other side of the street that you need to go into and head in that direction. Do not look back, just keep moving until you are safely inside. Should you adopt the 'head down' method, you may be mistaken for easy prey, and it is in these circumstances I have known the clipboarders to give chase.  Actually, while I’m on the subject, I witnessed somebody just the other day, attempt this manoeuvre. It resulted in both clipboarder and prey breaking into a run, the clipboarder did indeed give chase and cut the poor woman off at the corner. She then went on to beat her into submission and dragged her away by her hair screaming something about taste tests, so be warned.   4. This one only applies to the catalogue women but it's definitely worth noting. It came from a colleague of mine who, one lunch time was pushed beyond her limit having already been offered 4 catalogues from other she-demons further down, 2 Gishoos and to participate in a local consumer research initiative. She said at the top of her voice with a very cross look on her face 'DO I LOOK LIKE I BUY CLOTHES FROM A CATALOGUE' Actually, she does, and she was wearing them at the time but that is irrelevant. All that matters is she escaped unscathed.  If You Get Caught   Sadly, there will come a time in all of our lives when we will be caught unaware and unable to do anything other than listen to them while they reel off their opening line. The game is far from over though so don't despair.  If you are stopped by a catalogue woman and the usual No gets ignored, ask if they have a hardcore S&M section since you’ve been wanting some new nipple clamps for ages now and the shops just don’t seem to stock them like they used to. They will usually look horrified at the request and turn a funny red colour. If however they say 'Yes, Page 92' well, you're on your own.  If you are stopped by a market researcher and again, the No isn't working, simply say 'Cheese' to anything she asks you (unless she is asking about cheese). Actually, you can use any random word as long as it bares no relevance to the questions being asked, animal noises are also excellent. It might take a few minutes for her to give up but the fun you will have messing with her mind far outweighs the time lost.  Finally, I would like to wish you all luck in the future. I suspect if news of this little piece of literary genius gets out in the clipboarding world I will become their prime target, each of them will take turns in tormenting me, forcing me to come up with new and exciting ways to avoid them. You may even read in upcoming news letters 'Unidentified Coma-Girl critical after unprovoked beating by angry mob using clipboards'. Don't cry for me though, it will be completely worth it.   Now, who wants a catalogue?

      Just a quick post because I'm extremely tired.  I'm back from the concert and it was so amazing.  Not the music especially, although the headliners were in possession of a certain charm, but the little girl who I took, her face was a picture.  And a picture is worth a thousand words, but I don't have time for that right now, so I'll do it tomorrow.  Sleep well my lovely people :-D *hug*

      Since I left school, almost ten years ago, I have been struggling to belong.  Never quite sure of my place in the world or what I wanted to do.  For Eight years I worked in a supermarket as a customer service assistant.  My role varied over the years, ending up with me working in the service desk, which is something I enjoyed tremendously.  I made many friends out of my colleagues and customers and I was sad to leave.  But I did leave and my reasons for doing so were simply that I knew I could do more, and I knew I had more to give.  My next move was misguided.  I went to work in a bank, which is where I am currently working.  The work itself is not unpleasant but it was a move in the wrong direction.  I thought that fewer hours for more money and less frantic running around would make me happy, and for a while it did, but I am not fulfilling what I feel my destiny is.    These past few weeks I have not been myself.  You guys and my blogs have been like a rock, keeping me going and believing those things will be okay.  But still I have spent time alone in my room, crying and wondering if I'll ever find my path.  I prayed for guidance and went on with my life.  Then, a couple of days ago as I was walking back from work to the bus stop, I passed an exhibition that had been set up.  It was an adult education thing and I walked straight past it.  But something called to me to go back and I couldn't ignore it.  I returned and picked up a prospectus and read it on the bus.  As I browsed the courses, I noticed there was one for British Sign Language.  This is something I've always had a passion for.  While I was at school I taught myself but couldn't practice once I'd left and soon forgot all about it.    I knew in my heart that this is what I wanted, this was right for me.  So, I have enrolled in the course and will give my all to learning, and once I have achieved my qualification, I plan to find work where I can use my new skill, preferably with deaf children.  I finally feel like I have some direction.  The course starts in September, and so, from now until then I will be learning all that I can from my books so I am fully prepared. Wish me luck.

      Okay, I have become unstable and it wasn't a slow process. It happened over the course of a few short hours and I'm not sure there's any going back. Something inside of me let go and before I knew what had happened it was too late, and I’d bought the shoes.  For the first time in my life I decided to buy some ridiculously pointy heeled shoes, as opposed to the big chunky numbers that I'm used to. What possessed me, I'll never know. Actually that's a lie, I do know. They looked so pretty and I wanted my feet to look just as pretty in them. On the shelf they were graceful and elegant, it was a natural progression to think that graceful and elegant would automatically befall me if I wore them.  Yes, that didn't happen.  Instead, I found myself in a continuous battle between good and evil, wait, I mean between myself and gravity. Oh the laughs!  My first outing in the shoes had lured me into a false sense of security as I only ventured as far as the local shop. The journey is straightforward, a series of footpaths with no paving slabs, only concrete. There are no steep hills and it takes about 3 minutes to walk there. Clearly I was deluding myself, demonstrated by my second trip out.  I wore the shoes to work, which takes slightly longer. My first objective was to reach the bus stop. It sounds simple when you say it but it was quite the challenge, let me tell you. Firstly, it's like crazy paving for half the trip, which until recently posed no problem whatsoever, but in my new shoes was like an army assault course. I found myself taking three steps and then stopping to yank my foot free. Because of the added delay, as I came close to the bus stop the bus pulled up, forcing me to make a run for it. It is an experience that will haunt me for at least a week and a half. Did I mention that the soles of the shoes are made from the most slippery surface known to man? Well they are.   As I started to run I was suddenly struck with the realization that I resembled one of the girls from Clueless or Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. My arms involuntarily moved up into the 'little flappy bird wing' position and I began to totter as fast as I could (which was in truth probably about 2 mph if the pensioner that overtook me was anything to go by) in the direction of the bus. Fortunately for me the driver saw me as he started to drive off, and by some astounding miracle, he stopped for me. (I can only guess that he liked my shoes or thought I was having some kind of seizure). So, I continued toward the bus and as I approached the door, freaked out for a second because it felt as if one leg was shorter than the other. Then I freaked out even more because I couldn’t move the short leg! It then dawned on me that the reason I couldn’t move it was because my heel had gone into a crack in the pavement, so I yanked it out and dived on to the bus, pretending that I meant to do it or something. I don't think I convinced anyone.  The rest of the journey was relatively straightforward, except for the fact that I slipped between, and became wedged in, cracks in the pavement 5 times between the bus station and work. NOBODY WARNED ME ABOUT THIS!!!!   Always the optimist, I like to look on the bright side. The good news is, buying the shoes took care of the six accidents I had left over after my chain letter curse, and put a few in the bank for the next one I get.  So far, whilst wearing them, I have turned my ankle, turned it back the other way, gotten stuck in between paving slabs 14 TIMES, actually stepped OUT of the shoe because it was so firmly wedged and had to bend down and yank it out with my hands. And as a final insult (for now at least) been unable to stop after running, resulting in a skiddy, arms flailing near disaster, averted only due to a conveniently placed lamp post.  One benefit of the pointy heel is it makes a handy weapon with excellent mugger bashing potential. This is vital because I can say with confidence, running away would be an exercise in futility (although a potential mugger would probably double over laughing at the bimbo/over-excited seagull impression involuntarily demonstrated as you tried).  Historians say that a prophet foresaw the coming of pointy heels sometime in the ninth century and brought the well-loved superstition about it being unlucky to step on cracks in the pavement, into existence. I finally understand.  I will persevere with my shoes though, because they're pretty and dainty and make me look very ladylike.   Now if I could just stop falling down!

      You Can  Anything you want to do Can be achieved, know this is true The way to do it lies in you Just tell yourself you can.  When life seems tough, too hard to bear Your heart feels laden with despair Though smiles seem distant, you’ll get there Just know inside you can.  And if the world should disagree, Then know they’re wrong and make them see How bright you shine and easily Just do it, 'cause you can.  With love, Inky

      I'll never know who Daisy was, what her heart longed for, or what moved her.  I'll never know where she called home, or who gave her the painting that brings me so much joy.  I like to think it was perhaps a lover from a far away place who loved her so much that he wanted to share everything, including all that he saw.  I imagine he wrote to her often, declaring his love and telling her his secrets.  With the letters, would come a neatly wrapped parcel containing another beautiful window into his world, and I see her, opening the parcel with eager anticipation whilst still taking the utmost care not to tear the crisp brown paper, tied neatly with white parcel string.  I see her smiling as she holds the picture to the sky, and tries to imagine what he was thinking about as he glided the paintbrush laced with watercolour across the paper before him. All the while she knows in the deepest part of her soul, that he was thinking only of her.  Then she twirls around, deliriously bringing it close to her heart and then out again in front of her so her eyes can take in the magic that he has sent her.  And now I see her staring at empty walls, deciding where best to hang this masterpiece, perfected in it’s flaws much like the man who gave it to her.  A sunset, one she would never have seen were it not for him. Milky blue wisps of cloud are scattered delicately across the dusk. The sky is golden higher up, but dilutes itself to salmon pink and then lilac-grey until the heavens meet the water, which reflects the peachy hues of the days final glory.  Beneath the warm light, the water is still and full of greenish-black shadows from the reeds and grasses that poke through the surface. The tall trees that sway on one side of the lake also cast shadows and are silhouetted by the light as it draws its curtains and prepares to give way to the moon. Bushes and hedges on the other side of the lake cast soft reflections that gently ripple at the lapping shore.  She can almost feel the slight chill in the air, the chill of the impending night and she draws her cardigan a little tighter.  Oh, if only she could have been there with him.  I see her running her fingers along the wooden frame, carved by his loving hands and painted with gold coloured paint, which she thinks is unnecessary – this picture needs no such decoration.  And now I see her turning it over and looking at the back.  Five panels of wood hold the picture in place, uneven in width and spacing, held together with 18 nails over a thin sheet of plywood to protect his art.  How beautiful she thinks it is.  Two hooks are holding in place a thick piece of white string to hang it by and then as the light catches the back of the frame she notices a message, written in pencil, a message that brings a tear to her eye and a weak smile to her lips...   My Grandfather worked in demolition; he wrecked old houses and during his time in the job found many treasures, one of which being this picture.  Although he passed away at least five years ago, only recently have I discovered it.  It had been wrapped up safely in bubble wrap by my mum and dad and kept in a cupboard.  But since finding it, I have been captivated by it.  If only it could tell its stories.  Its gold coloured frame is now tarnished with age, the string is a rusty red and the nails are just plain rusty.  Small fragments of the wooden backing are chipped off and to me, it just makes it more perfect.  I have no idea what the message is, I can only make out a couple of words because of the ravages of time but the words are profound and touch me deep in my soul.  "For Daisy"

      It's a beautiful day out there, the sun is shining in through my window.  The light makes rainbows through the crystals that hang in front of it.  I feel groggy from not enough sleep but happy none the less.  I hope your day is beautiful too. *hug*

      I have a new blog which I intend to maintain alongside this one.  It is more to do with my spirituality.  For a more detailed explaination of my beliefs, follow me...   urlLink ...Angelic Whispers welcomes you.    I would love for anyone that is interested to hop on over and join me. If spirituality isn't your thing,then I won't be offended if you choose not to visit.

      I have enjoyed the luxury of a lazy weekend.  Currently, I am sitting on my bedroom floor, relaxing in complete peace. The intoxicating fragrence of incense drifts about the air and fills me completely. Angel music dances in my ears and my fingers roam happily across the keys of my laptop, saying nothing particular.    Such is the beauty of a lazy weekend.  I have a new shelf in my bedroom.  I find that I am constantly running out of room to put things (mainly books).  And so my new shelf has become the new home to my angels and the old angel shelf has become home to my spiritual books.  I will post pictures later.  I was going to go and meet with the little girl and her mum today to arrange thing for next week (the concert). Unfortunately her little brother isn't too well and so we're are going to work out the arrangements on the phone.  On Tuesday I am going over to visit my best friend.  I'm so looking forward to it.  It seems like a lifetime since we last just sat and talked. I am going to bring my angel cards with me and I'm also taking a set that I bought for her as a gift so we can read for each other.    I should be a beautiful day.

      One of the most important things I want to accomplish during my life is to become a childrens author.  I have already written four short stories which would make lovely little picture books and all of them have been well recieved by my best friends daughter, who is five, that I initially wrote them for.  I'm currently working on number five, but for some reason the words won't fall into place. The story is all mapped out in my head.  I know where we're starting, where we're ending and what should happen to take us on the journey between the two points.  But I can't seem to write it and I don't know why.  I'm going to give myself a little more time and then try again.  After that, I need to be brave and start sending them out into the world.   Here's hoping it goes well.

      There was a storm breaking outside earlier.  The sky was a mysterious shade of yellowish purple with dark heavy clouds.  The faint and distant sound of thunder rumbling was slowly growing louder and more hungry by the second. Wild flickers of lightning painted the evening air with luminous ferrocity. Heavy rain splattered over the parched earth and mimiced the sound of the wind through the grasses.  And I sat and watched this wonderful display of nature as it unfolded through my window.  We don't get storms as often as I would like around here, so I really savour them when they choose their moments.

      Anyone living in the UK will be aware of those ridiculous and pointless 'Preparing for emergencies' leaflet that the government have wasted goodness know's how much money on producing.  Well, while wandering through the open fields of cyberspace, I found this site....   urlLink http://www.preparingforemergencies.co.uk/   ... and had to rush to find the nearest cyber-loo because I swear I nearly pee'd myself laughing.Enjoy :-D

      I'm absoloutely roasting here.  Both my hands have swollen up with little red bumps.  I can't quite decide if it is dermatitus *probably spelt that wrong, not bothered* or just a heat rash.  Fortunately it's stopped itching after I soaked my hands in ice water for five minutes but it's still really red and raised.  Blee.  I feel very uninspired today, maybe it's the heat or maybe it's just my natural state 98% of the time.  Who can say...  I hope everybody's weekend is wonderful.  *many hugs*

      I was going to update yesterday but fate, coupled with my computers sudden urge to crash prevented it. In truth I did update, I had a post written and was almost ready to publish and *poof* it was gone. And so I decided to do something constructive and bake a cake, which turned into a gataux. A three layer rich chocolate cake, with creme fresh and black cherry preserve for filling, and topped with a yummy chocolate icing. It was very tasty. I am a chocoholic and so I am naturally going to say that, but regardless, it's the truth.  I still haven't been to the gym this week, and if I'm honest, I doubt I will. I only joined up with the intention of going after work and since I've been off work and on vacation, well, it becomes obvious ;o)  I've been going out of my mind with kitten antics these past few days as my brothers kittens are visiting while he's in Germany. The kittens have decided they are not going to be friends and so the guests are living on the upper floor of the house, while our ones have claimed the lower floor. Ours are more tollerant and adventurous and have taken to wandering up the stairs for a nose around every now and then, but are usually greeted with hisses.  Oh well, it's all fun and games.  Over the past two days I have printed out all of my poetry and prose, and my childrens stories and placed them in a brown folder that I've decorated with gold leaf skeletons.  I ran out of room in the original book I had my poetry in and so I decided it would be a good idea to just keep it all together and be able to add to it whenever I need to, without worrying that the pages would run out.  Also, should I ever decide to get off my bum and actually try to get some of it published, I can photocopy whatever I need to and then simple clip it back in.  Everybody wins :-D  I was hoping the weather would be nice today so I could get out to the park and relax with my notebook by the river, but it's looking overcast and there's thunder in the air so I might make do with the fishpond in my garden.  But on the other hand I might take a chance and just go for it.

      Careless acts, like naked fists, Hit hard with striking blows. This wound is deep. This pain pronounced. And though the bleeding shows, This wound won't find an exit. For unbroken skin won't seep, Subtle bleeding doesn't crave An end or a release. Instead it rests and fades away And festers black to green. Then yellow, With a hundred shades of colour in between. And I would heal more swiftly, If you would just cut me down And let me bleed my could-have-beens. But still you come around. And I can count upon one hand, The times you touched this heart, But for the times you bruised it, Or tore my life apart, Well darling, there are not the stars, In twenty million skies. And so tears fall like raindrops, From my stinging, bloodstained eyes. This was an end that did not start, A start that will not end You seemed to think your power, Gave you licence to offend. You were wrong the time has come We must step off the ride. You only have one choice to make, Cut me or leave me, Decide.  Inky

      Today whilst cleaning I came across some of my old notebooks.  They shone like long forgotten treasure.  It was captivating to read some of the thoughts that pulsed through my mind in the days gone by.  I found a story I had written, more of an account really, about something that happened a couple of years ago which I have posted on Angelic Whispers.   I found a lot of turmoil, I found a lot of pain and a lot of hurt too.  It shows me how little I have changed, and at the same time, how much.  Diarys and notebooks are such wonderful things to me.  Permanent reminders, and records of a life lived and lessons learned.  It is the same with blogging too.  Years from now, I hope to be able to look back at the things I've done, the friends I've made and the effect we have had on eachother.   And who knows who we'll be by then!
