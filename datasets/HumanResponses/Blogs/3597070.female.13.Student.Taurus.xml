      Okay, so I'm back from Florida. Luckily, I survived the plane ride. You may be thinking, "Well, duh! She's here typing, isn't she?" but you never know; I could be a ghost!  urlLink      We went to Disney world the whole week. It was pretty fun, but it was so hot and humid!!! It was like 95 degrees every day!  I went on this totally awesome ride called the rockin' rollercoaster. It was so cool! It was indoors so there was music blasting throughout the whole thing, and it did cool upsidedown loops and stuff. In my opininon, it's the best coaster in the world! It's definately rockin'!  urlLink      I also went on the tower of terror. It was so freaky! You dropped so fast you couldn't even move!  I was so happy when I met my idols, Chip, Dale, and Goofy! They are so cool!  So those were the highlights of my vacation and let's just say I'm glad to be back. Oh, by the way, my baby gerbils have gotten so big! they have full coats of fur and we know their genders: one is a tannish color and it is a boy. His name is Caramel. ( Don't ask, my sisters picked it out. In my opinion, it's a horrible name for a gerbil.) The other one is black, just like the mother, and it is a girl.  I  named her Trixie.   And now it's time for the image of the day! Today's image is:  urlLink     And today's saying of the day is: Bamalamadingdong! (bam-u-loma-ding-dong)

         So last night my friend Delia slept over. I'm going o Florida tomorrow and I had to pack, but I didn't feel like it, so Delia was trying to get some outfits together so my mom wouldn't blow up @ me. (She's the sensible one.) It was so funny cuz whenever she would pull out an outfit, I would say, "it doesn't fit!" because, like I said, I didn't feel like packing. It took like an hour to pick out 4 shirts and 4 shorts!      Then when it was time for bed, I wasn't tired, so I hid under the bed and wouldn't come out. Delia was trying to get me out, but every time I saw her hand I woud bite it. Eventually, she lured me out with a story about Scrumpliumpus. (Scrumpliumpus is an animal she made up for me. It is a wird fluff ball thing that annoys everyone in sight.) It finally put me to sleep.     And now it's time for the image of the day! Todays image of the day is:        That's a cute little cat thing that I thought was funny.     And lastly, today's saying of the day is:  Person 1: Yes!  Person 2: No!  Person 1: Yes!  Person 2: No!  Both: Hey! That's a patterin!  I won't be posting anymore blogs till at least next Sun. cuz I'm going to Disney world. (That is, if I survive the plane ride.) Wish me luck!
