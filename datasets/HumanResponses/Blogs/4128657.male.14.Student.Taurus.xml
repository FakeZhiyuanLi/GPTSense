      This evening we tried a restaurant we hadn't been to before.  The following is our review of our experience tonight.  Antonio's Ristorante at 626 W. Tefft Street in Nipomo  We arrived about 6:30 and there was only one other couple in the restaurant. All the tables in the restaurant are close together. (about 16-20 tables) We were seated at a table for 4 near a window (and right next to the only other couple).     Don  ordered Diet Coke, garden salad with bleu cheese dressing and one of the specials for the evening, Lasagna with meat sauce.  Andy  ordered Sprite and a small double cheese pizza.(10")  Liz  ordered Water, garden salad and Spaghetti with Meat Balls  Our waiter, brought our drinks promptly and also a basket of warm bread and butter.  The bread was dense and chewy and very good.  The garden salads were very fresh with a mix of salad greens, thin onion slices, a few slices of tomato, and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The dressing was on the salad and was just the right amount.    As we waited for our food (not very long-timed nicely with the bread and salads), the restaurant began to fill up.  When we left most of the tables were full.  Don - Large serving, meaty  (***) brought 1/2 home. Andy - pizza was very good, finished it all.  (****) Liz - small meatballs, meaty sauce, plenty of sauce and parmesean cheese.  Meatballs were bland.  The sauce had a surprising cinnamon taste and probably had some cream.  (***)  Large serving-brought 1/2 home   Overall rating:  *** (3 of 5)  Atmosphere (***)  Food (***)  Cost ($$$$$)

      Today is the birthday of Stephen Dunn. His collection of poetry, Different Hours, won the Pulitzer Prize in 2000.    TO A TERRORIST   For the historical ache, the ache passed down which finds its circumstance and becomes the present ache, I offer this poem  without hope, knowing there's nothing,  not even revenge, which alleviates a life like yours. I offer it as one  might offer his father's ashes to the wind, a gesture when there's nothing else to do.   Still, I must say to you:  I hate your good reasons.  I hate the hatefullness that makes you fall  in love with death, your own included.  Perhaps you're hating me now,  I who own my own house  and live in a country so muscular,  so smug, it thinks its terror is meant only to mean well, and to protect.   Christ turned his singular cheek,  one man's holiness another's absurdity.  Like you, the rest of us obey the sting,   the surge. I'm just speaking out loud to cancel my silence. Consider it an old impulse,  doomed to become mere words.   The first poet probably spoke to thunder and, for a while, believed thunder had an ear and a choice.

      Morning weather(8:30):  Overcast and 56 degrees.  Yesterday we found blueberries, raspberries and olallieberries at the farmer's market in Arroyo Grande. I find when I buy berries at the farmer's market they are very ripe, so I have to use them in a day or two.  I made this recipe last summer a few times and it was delicious. I made 18 muffins from this recipe and I baked them for only 22 minutes.  So what exactly is an olallieberry? It’s a loganberry crossed with a youngberry, or what we know as a blackberry crossed with a European raspberry. It’s deep purple in color and tartly delicious in taste, perfect for pies and jams.  http://www.sbceo.k12.ca.us/~uccesb1/smfnws10.htm    Banana Raspberry Muffins  I found this recipe at www.chocolatesnowball.com/muffins.html   Slightly redolent of banana, these moist, berry-full treats are wonderful for Sunday brunch.  Blackberries or blueberries can replace the raspberries in this recipe.  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour   2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder   1/2 teaspoon baking soda   1/2 teaspoon salt   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted (I used margarine)  2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar   3 eggs   3 ripe bananas, mashed (I used 2 1/2 )  2/3 cup whole milk   1 teaspoon vanilla extract   1 1/2 cups raspberries, fresh or frozen (I used a mix of the berries I found at the farmer's market)  1/4 cup Butter Streusel (see fundamentals) (I didn't add this)  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper cupcake liners, or coat the muffin tins with melted butter and dust with flour, or spray generously with cooking spray.  To make sure muffins release with ease, coat the top of the pan as well as the inside of the cups when you grease the tins.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.  Whisk the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl, and then whisk the eggs.  Add the bananas, mil and vanilla.  Add the dry ingredients all at once, stirring just until blended.  Quickly fold in the berries.  Divide into prepared muffin cups and sprinkle with Butter Streusel.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until the tops of the muffins are golden brown and they spring back when touched with a finger.  Cool for about 5 minutes, then remove from the pan.  Makes 12 muffins.  High altitude: Reduce baking powder to 1 3/4 teaspoons.

      Dream Catcher   I watched you closely As you ran fast as you could across the field of life, Frantically chasing a dream-butterfly With your net.   I saw you stumble over rocks, And slip in streams, All for the sake of this butterfly, That you couldn't seem to catch.   So gently I lifted you up, And took you in my arms. And told you a truth I learned Too long ago to mention.  "Little dreamer, dreams are free creatures. You cannot catch them in a net, Nor trap them in a bag. Nor should you try, my friend.  For look! See this field, That you were trying to cross so fast, Is covered with beauty and wonder, If only you could stop and see!  So keep your mind on your dreams, But do not chase them so hard That you miss everything else there is to see!"  And then you raised your head and looked. The beauty made you gasp, And as it did, a butterfly flapped tiny wings, Floated down to land upon you, And made all your dreams real.   -- Andrea Smith

      Every child is a miracle...with odds against so astronomical they're effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiply those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive; meeting; siring this precise son; that exact daughter...until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from that chaos of improbability--like turning air to gold--that is the crowning unlikelihood. A miracle.  After Alan Moore, Watchmen

      I have been working on my parent's 50th wedding anniversary invitation.  The butterflies were stamped on cardstock with antique gold and bronze and then die cut.  To get the 3-d effect, I used pop dots.  I hope to finish the invitations tomorrow so they will be mailed on Tuesday morning.  (Monday being a holiday!)  The gold and the green show up brighter in the picture than they are on the invitation.    urlLink

       American proverb:  It doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot chasm in two ten-foot jumps.   Andre Gide:   One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.   Charles DuBois:   The important thing is this: To be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.   Mark Twain:   Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.   Ralph Waldo Emerson:   (probably erroneously) Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.

       MAKE YOUR LIFE AN EXPERIMENT     Do you experiment with new attitudes and new behaviors? Do you constantly try to improve your skills? Do you make your life an "active science"? It is not hard to see what can happen when we refuse to improve ourselves.   Do you know who set the standard for fine watch-making for most of the 20th Century? If you answered, "The Swiss," you are correct. Swiss wrist watches dominated world markets for at least 60 years and Swiss companies were committed to constant refinement of their craft.   It was the Swiss who came forward with the minute hand and the second hand. They led the world in discovering better ways to manufacture the gears, bearings, and mainsprings of watches. They even led the way in waterproofing techniques and self-winding models. By 1968, the Swiss made 65 percent of all watches sold in the world and laid claim to as much as 90 percent of the profits.   Now...which country sold the most wrist watches in the 1980s? The answer is Japan. By 1980, Swiss companies had laid off thousands of watch-makers and controlled less than 10 percent of the world market. Their profit domination dropped to less than 20 percent.   Between 1979 and 1981, eighty percent of Swiss watchmakers lost their jobs. Why? The Swiss had refused to change the way they traditionally designed watches and utilize the less expensive and more accurate Quartz crystal. (Quartz movement, ironically, was invented by a Swiss.) They did not seriously experiment with a radical new way of designing timepieces.     Our lives are not so different. Without constant experimentation -- daily growth and change to become the best we can be -- our old attitudes, behaviors and skills will no longer work for us. The old ways of thinking and doing will be about as relevant as a grandfather clock on a space shuttle. We need to experiment and improve. We need to turn our lives into an active science.      "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do," wrote Mark Twain. "So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream.  Discover."    Make your life an experiment...and something wonderful can happen!   By Steve Goodier

      Andy really enjoys flying the kite. "A new hobby." He can keep the kite&nbsp;up for quite awhile and do figure 8's. In the picture below you can see the kite in front of the tree in the upper right corner.  urlLink

      After many attempts I figured out how to add the purple ruffle.  I wanted it to have the rag seam on one side and a finished seam on the other--so it was a puzzle!  After I added the ruffle I had to snip all the seams to rag them.  This picture is before the ragging.  urlLink

      We flew out of San Luis Obispo Thursday morning at 11:00.  It was a beautiful , sunny morning - one of the reasons everyone should visit us-it was warm and so nice.  When we left it was 63 degrees.  All of our flights were on time and we arrived in Green Bay about 10:20.  We finally found a room earlier today at the Sleep Inn in DePere, WI--only a few miles south of the Green Bay airport.  We finally found out why it was so difficult to get a room--the desk clerk, Tony, who is an IM native and former IMHS teacher, told us it Family Packer weekend-over 48,000 tickets have been sold!!  When we arrived in Green Bay it was 63 degrees and the forecast is for a record low tonight of 47 degrees.  It is also forecasted to be a warm, sunny day with highs in the low 70s.  Just wanted to let everyone now our trip has started smoothly--oh, except I forgot my tootbrush!!  (But, the Sleep Inn is right next to Super Walmart!!

       How do you treat ideas?   Treat them TENDERLY--they can be killed quickly. Treat them GENTLY--they can be bruised in infancy. Treat them RESPECTFULLY--they could be the most valuable thing that ever came into your life. Treat them PROTECTIVELY--don't let them get away. Treat them NUTRITIONALLY--feed them and feed them well. Treat them ANTISEPTICALLY--don't let them get infected with the germs of negative thoughts. Treat them RESPONSIBLY--Respond! Act! Do something with them! Decide to decide!  - Anonymous

      This bag is called a string along. I found the black and white floral fabric and wanted something plain to use for the casing. I really like the burgundy fabric and was able to find the burgandy cording to match. Although it doesn't show up in the picture, the burgandy fabric has a light floral pattern on it.  urlLink

       urlLink   This is the second "string along" I made. The outside of the bag and the lining are made from the same fabric. I used gold cording to match the gold swirl pattern on the fabric. I made the pocket larger than the first bag I made and put a seam in the middle to divide the pocket. This is such an easy project. I think the hardest part is finding the cording to use for the straps and top opening. I final found it at Betty's in San Luis Obispo. While I was there I also discovered in the last two weeks they have added a whole yarn department that includes lots of different needles and pattern books.

      Finished quilt. This was a fun project and turned out better than I thought it would. I have started to cut out the fabric "sandwiches" for the blue and yellow quilt. Like a lot of quilt projects, cutting out all the pieces correctly at the beginning is a key part. My favorite part was adding the ruffle. I think it really gives the quilt a finished look and makes the wrong side just as nice as the "raggy" side.  Yesterday I received the latest gooseberry patch catalog in the mail. On page 43 there is a rag quilt similar to the one I made. (although I am not sure it is flannel). The price in the catalog is $125!! (and I don't think it has the added ruffle.) The quilt does take about 8 yards of fabric and nice flannel can be $8-$9 per yard. I ws able to get the flannel for the quilt on sale at Beverly's in San Luis Obispo.  urlLink http://www.gooseberrypatch.com   urlLink

      Today Andy picked up his schedule for his freshman year at Nipomo High School.  Algebra 2 AP World History PreAP English 9 PE 9 Biology 1 Band (Cello and percussion!!) Spanish (Distance learning)  School begins Monday, August 23 at 7:45 A.M. !!! Next week all students will be issued a set of books that they keep at home.  Another set of books will be kept in the classroom for students to use.  No more heavy backpacks!!  The school only has lockers in the locker rooms in the gym--keeping a set of books at home elimates the need for lockers.  He also bought PE clothes--nice colors-maroon, silver, and black.

      It was the Buddha who said, "The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, not to worry about the future, or not to anticipate troubles, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly." And Jesus said, "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself."
