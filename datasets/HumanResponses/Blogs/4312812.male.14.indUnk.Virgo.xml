      My uncle Nelson, from Elkford BC, and my aunt Lorie, from Calgary, have flown to Ontario to see my grandmother who over the past couple of months has taken a number of strokes. She is fine at the moment, but they don't want to risk anything so they came down. I was already in BC for 2 and a half weeks in July so my dad had to take time off then and couldn't come down (for those of you who don't know, my dad, uncle nelson, and uncle mike all live in Elkford BC), he said he will in september or october when he can get holidays or special time off or some shit. Anyway, my Auntie Anne (aunt anne just doesn't sound right) is a sociopathic kaniving lunatic, who has screwed more people over than Ralph Klein, my aunt connie, who back in her earlier days was just plain fuckin crazy, stealing cars, doing drugs, taking potshots at my grandpa from a barn roof, etc. is now the most responsible Taillon of the family, my uncle nelson (from bc) is half-deaf so he speaks extra loud so he can hear himself but doesnt know it and hes a nice guy but just....nelson. my aunt lorie from calgary is probably the nicest one of them all, and she happens to be less than 5'1'', and has had back problems for the past few years and the doctors have never seen anything like it (trust my fuckin family to create sum new illness...), my aunt marie was fired from Co-operators (my mom works there and got her the job) for embezzlement but told everyone else she quit, and later phoned my grandma and said "i hope you have a heart attack and die" and hung up. that sent my cousin judy home back to saskatchewan (lorie's daughter, whos like 30-something) because once upon a time marie told the administration on judy (shes a registered nurse) that she miss-diagnosed my aunt lynn's husband's cancer, (he died before i knew him...not that close to the taillons) and almost got her fired, but nurses dont diagnose anyway. So, we've covered my uncle nelson, my sociopathic auntie anne, my deaf and paranoid aunt lynn, my short and illness riddled aunt lorie, my formerly psycho aunt connie, my con-artist aunt marie, and my grandmother who had mini-strokes(on my dad's side). I have another aunt, aunt brenda, who used to be our cleaning lady but kept fucking up our vacum and never did anything so we said fuck it and stopped having her as our cleaning lady, but hasn't really done anything outstandingly bad. My auntie anne, aunt lynn, aunt brenda, aunt connie and aunt marie all live in guelph, whereas my aunt lorrie lives in calgary. So that's 6 aunts. Then, theres just my dad, uncle mike (great guy), and my slightly odd, loud, and forgetfull uncle nelson. My dad has usually had at least 2 beers into him, no less, my uncle mike is your average nice-guy, and my uncle nelson refuses to drink beer or pop but will take a vodka cooler any day. he enjoys boating and radios and is just weird sometimes. he talks very fast. anyway, i had to spend the day in kitchener with him while he kept calling me chris, but i couldnt correct him because he never hears me anyway so i said fuck it. he introduced to a pile of old friends of his who were all mechanics, and the first person had one seriously riced-up black, 1999 Honda civic. surprise surprise. so, we went to kitchener, alma, elora, and fergus, spending about and hour and a half in each place. my mom took the day off today to spend it with my aunt lorrie, and i guess they had a great tme or something i dunno...but yah, basically if i hear another person start talking like my uncle nelson again im going to shoot myself. then he gets home and starts talking about fuckin dump-trucks and their weight, capacity and shit like that ("it weighs 200 tons!! we got a bigger one up at the mine" blah blah blah). but all in all i guess i had a good time.   right now i just finished playing Vice City where i tried doing a firetruck mission where u have to make it to level 12, running around putting out fires that cars have been set on, and then the flaming people who get out of the car once it's been extinguished, who fucking annoyingly sprint away and all start running around the city and you have to track all the bastards down in basically, under 5 minutes. but, i succeeded, with my mad Vice City skills, and got a FLAME-PROOF TOMMY VERCETTI. yes thats right folks, my character is now fire-proof, rendering all forms of fire useless against him (unless hes in a car which then blows up and kills everything within the immediate vicinity. soooo...i am currently at 82% completion, i have done all the property missions, all main missions, all side missions, and pay-phone missions, knocked off every store, killed at least 1 of every gang member, got the highest media attention, got 99/100 hidden packages, did the pizza-delivery missions, did the vigilante missions (up to level 87, biatch!), now im going to work on the ambulance missions, which gives you infinate sprinting if you complete them. yay woot.   while i was with my uncle nelson, he borrowed my aunt lynns Ford 1993 Probe GTS, which has been (unknowingly to her) turned into a fuckin awesome sleeper. T87 turbo, intercooler, we think the cams have been changed...not sure tho, exhaust, and a direct feed nitrous system, my aunt lynn never knew this tho, becuase her son Chris (my cousin) whos like 30 now worked @ linimar or euclid or some place where u make good money and just spent all his money on it, he lived with his mom into his 20's and i guessed just totally suped the shit out of the car. it was an automatic tho, and he couldnt change that because his mother would have definately noticed and got maaad pissed. he got a new computer chip to manage the shifts and the power and boost and everything, which is basically necessity, a mechanic friend of my uncles nelson's thinks that he got new highperformance spark plugs and fuel injectors, and found like 10 bottles of Royal Purple Synthetic racing oil and fuel injector cleaner....it was sweet. anyway after that little discovery we went out and started trying to drag-race people but saw like 7 cops and stopped. g'day folks.   -greg

      Hi. G here. im bored...do you ever get bored? well since this is sort of a place to vent, i think that is what i shall do. ok here goes: HOLY FUCK PETER PISSES ME OFF OMG HES SUCH AN ASS...i tihnk that did the job. anyway i got in an argument with him (peter: greg ur name sucks  me: still dont get it?  peter: fuck you  me: wtf  peter: manson sucks me: if u came to talk to me and tell me manson sucks and hendrix rocks then i really dfc peter: ur stupid cuz manson sucks and u like manson and not jimmi hendrix, even tho i know shit about him me: pete, screw off peter: IM BIGGER AND STRONGR AND INFINETLY MORE DEVE) yes, that last line is actually a quote. since we ALL know what deve is, i think i shall feel sad that peter is more deve than i am. any ideas? anyone? anyway, peter may be stronger, (hes stronger than like everyone but konrad who happens to be a beast) but i am far exceedingly...less stupider. if i just said that than you can imagine peter. hehehe. anyway, he comes back on a week later and pretends that nothing happend. little does he know i saved the convo and confronted him about it which he then promptly blamed konrad. "yah that wasnt me u know...konrad was typing all that and said all that". peter...ur a fucktard, stfu.      I wonder if you can change the font of this. People have been asking "whats with the "antiricerracer" part of youre website?" . Well, a ricer is sumone (technically) who has (usually, almost always) a car that has more show, than go. ie a body kit, spoiler, altezzas/HID's, rims and only a turbocharger. well, thats a bad example becuz you need a catback if you have a turbo, so it would probvably be just a catback (only adding about 8-12 horsepower). So, you've got a guy with a totally modded out car and only an exhaust enhancement. That person, is therefore called, a "ricer". ricer: one who usually knows shit about cars and thinks they're in the "import scene" but just adds 600lbs of plastic and lights instead of actually taking it to the track. ricers are most often seen in Hondas, almost always a civic (usually an early->mid '90s model), and it looks and sounds like the fastest car ever (with the help of a coffee can on the muffler tip), but when you look under the hood you might just see a little polish, or the same old stinky dusty stock engine. Now, a real racer is someone who (races, obviously) gets the go, before the show. I, am an anti-ricer-racer. Meaning, i am totally against riceage and all riceyness (i dont think ever said the word rice so much in 10 minutes in my life) making me anti-rice. I would rather have a sleeper-RX-7 or sleeper-Supra, than a riced up Zaggato. mad riceage is also found @ www.guelphracing.com which is the saddest, sorriest bunch of excuses i've ever seen. Only like 2 of the 10 people have even been to the track, one of them actually having a time under 14 seconds. anyway its getting late, (3:39am) so i will talk to you guys later. PS nic i got the spoiler for the turtle ready!

      Hey boils an gouls, this is greg, your host for the evening. in this episode we will be iscussing our first blog, which essentially, is abso-fuckin-lutely nothing at all! thats right folks, step right up and view the wondrous times that greg has experienced in his 15 years, 1 month and....11...days of existence! He has learned much, and has much to learn, but is full of wisdom nonetheless. Like, what do you do if u have sodium cyanide on your clothes? Ask me, greg! Chances are, if you need the answer to a useless peice of knowledge or trivia, i will have it. I am simply gifted for remembering stupid facts. Doctors say its because i'm left handed. wut do they know? psshh mine didnt even know you have a pressure-point in the middle of your hand that controls you diaphragm. what a foo'. anyway, i suppose that this blog should be made interesting so ill include a conversation i had about suping up turtles.   greg says: should i put a spoiler on my cat? Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: yeah of course Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: dont u mean car? greg says: no greg says: all fast animals need spoilers Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: of course, all fast animals need spoilers greg says: especially turtles n00b Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: especailly frogs s0per n00b greg says: dude u know how fuckin fast turtles go with spoilers on their backs!?1 Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: dude Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: like 1000mph greg says: STFU ub0r newbx0r! greg says: lol Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: i once saw a turtle with a spoiler, i told on the kids on the block, but they didnt believe me greg says: no theyll hit about 250mph...somewhere around there Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: no i swear i was going atleast 350mph Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: and i saw flames coming out of its shell greg says: ude greg says: thats a myth greg says: u saw a green rabbit greg says: f00l Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: oh shit Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: mabye it was too greg says: turtles only go 250 Nic - Point, Counterpoint. says: i thought it was a turtle cuz it was on the water greg says: cuz theyre spoilers r so big greg says: it slows em down greg says: but its speeds u a normal turtle without a spoiler .....actually...fuck it imm not going to make u all read that. basically we talked about suping up animals, especially my turtle with a stainless steal spoiler and carbon fibre flippers and shell. anyway if u want to see how the conversation went i have saved it and u cant download it from me via MSN file sharing shit. its about 11kb so it should only take about .5 of a second once it gets started. you can contact me for it @ public_secrecy@hotmail.com. liz is a bitch and k-rod is a newb.
