						   My first year as an attorney has had its ups and downs.  I guess that is to be expected, but the ups are certainly more fun than the downs.  Of course, the first and most important up was the raise I received upon passing the bar exam.  The first down was being threatened with Rule 11 sanctions, but that worked itself out and was simply the result of an older attorney from a big firm trying to bluff the new kid in the small firm.      In the beginning there was very little change in what I did as a law clerk and what I do as an attorney, the main difference being that I could finally sign my own name to my work.  I still ran to my higher ups for approval before filing anything, but over the last few months, I have actually been generating business.  Now that I have my own clients and my own caseload, it's much easier to pick something up and run with it than it was when other attorneys' clients were on the line.      I've done quite a few depositions and a few hearings.  Working in the firm that I'm in, I get to do a little bit of every kind of law, plaintiff and defense work, personal injury, class actions, insurance claims and defenses, EEOC claims, Workers' Comp claims, Social Security, the occasional divorce, etc.   At least, things rarely get boring.   The down side to that is there's alot of research involved due to the fact that we work with so many different types of cases, and many many briefs to be written.    As far as my personal life goes, I've finally given in and bought a house of my own.  It's nice to know that for once in my life, I don't have to worry about how I'm going to make the payments on things.  Of course, it's all my responsibility now too.  That was a little scary at first, but I guess that's just part of being a member of the real world instead of just a student.      Between the new responsibilities at work and the new responsibilities at home, things get a little stressful sometimes.  On the up side though, we've got two new law clerks at work and I've been given full permission to make use of them.  Oh the joys of inflicting terror into the hearts of the young and gullible.  It's my turn now to have the clerks cowering before my verbal abuse and unrealistic demands.  I learned well from the associate I worked under.  Seriously, I love my law clerks and I wouldn't dream of being mean to them.  The worst thing I've ever done is refer to their office as the day care center and the office manager as their babysitter.

						   Life has suddenly become hectic.  The title of this post is so accurate.  I've suddenly become booked for depositions, hearings, meetings, and so on that were not expected.  I truly hate going into a deposition on an hour's notice and not knowing a thing in the world about the case.  It doesn't help that the other associate in the office is causing us great worry.  He looks like he may have a breakdown soon.  I sincerely hope not because if he does, I won't be far behind.  School has started back, so our law clerks have returned to class and left us to fend for ourselves.  I kind of miss them.  They at least gave me something to smile about, not to mention that they certainly improved the view around the place.  That also means that my kids have gone back to school also.  In case I haven't mentioned it, I've got four kids, ages 12, 11, 9, and 7.  Boy, girl, girl, and boy.  The boys live with their dad during the school year and the girls live with me, so I do have a little help with them.  You would think that my life would be easier with them at school, but I leave for work about the time they go to school and I get back after they're home.  Now, I've got homework to deal with as well as getting them fed, bathed, and in bed before midnight.  Guitar lessons also started back for my 9 year old.  She is convinced that she's going to be a rock star when she grows up.  I must admit, she's gotten pretty good at playing Yankee Doodle.  She thinks she's ready to start playing Skynard riffs though.  More power to her.  She's still undecided if she wants to be a rock star, a lawyer, or a teacher--or maybe all three.  The older one wants to be a fashion designer.  She's a little too girly for my tastes, but hey, she is a girl after all.  I must admit that I don't agree with her on alot of things.  For example, we had a debate last week over a crown.  She ordered a bunch of crowns, tiaras, etc. from a catalog and she did not think it was appropriate for me to wear the king's crown because I was a girl.  I don't think I ever did convince her that the simple fact that I was female did not prohibit me from being king if I wanted to be.  I guess, to be technical, the definition of king does include male, but nothing says it has to be that way.  Hmmph.  I am doing one girly thing lately though.  I'm learning to cook.  I don't mean throwing something in the microwave and heating it up, which is my normal routine, but really cooking.  You know, with the use of a stove and recipes and stuff.  It's pretty cool.  I'm really into baking, but even though I follow the recipe, the mixtures I concoct generally end up being runnier than they're supposed to be.  Tip of the day:  When baking teacakes (aka cookie-like substinence) and the recipe calls for you to roll the dough out and cut the cakes before placing on the pan, do it.  Otherwise you end up with a huge pan of run-together cookie/cake mess that is rather unattractive.  Of course, in that situation, you're in luck whether your guests like cookies or cake.  You can throw one on a plate and call it whatever you like.

						   One thing that young attorneys should realize is that your life is not going to be all big exciting trials and intense negotiations, at least not at first. I have been lucky enough to work on a couple of those big exciting trials and even helped pick the jury for one -- my home town. Work for newbies is likely to mean lots of research, attending hearings on trivial matters (ie petitioning the court to approve a settlement agreement or to withdraw funds from a guardianship), sitting in on long and boring depositions, and my favorite (So Not!), collections.  That was a rather accurate description of my last week and a half. I am sick of harassing poor people with no money and ordering them to pay my clients. The hearings are okay. They get me out of the office and into the court room at least. The depositions though, that is an entirely different story. I sat in for a day on some of the most boring depositions ever. Of course, I've sat in on several of the depos in this same case before (there's only about 30 plaintiffs and they all have to be deposed) so I already know all the questions and most of the answers. That day had its moments though.  By the last deposition (around 6:00 pm), the deposing attorney was so tired that when he asked the deponent (a cute little blonde twenty-year-old) about her physical health, he just blurted out, "Do you have any diseases?" Hilarious.  One of the other deponents was in the National Guard during integration and spent twenty-nine days on the Ole Miss campus when James Meridith started there. Now, the law school at Ole Miss has a memorial to James Meredith. Times have certainly changed over the last forty or fifty years. Thank God!      I guess there is an upside to all of this though.  Our chief partner just got back from Panama and has gone to Denver, and our three-year associate just got back from Europe and is going to Maui next week.  One day...
