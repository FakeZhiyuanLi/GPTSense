       Hey there me peeps,    &nbsp;  It's your humble narrator here, I'm off to the big smoke on business tomorrow so I thought it best to clear the crap out of my head before the long drive to fair ol London town.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  The following is a list of thoughts i've been in possesion of since the last time we spoke...&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Here I go....    &nbsp;  Root vegtables are just roots with fancy names.   Opal is the birthstone for october.   Corpus christi is latin for 'body of christ'   Kit kats with four fingers should be called kit kat kut kip's.    &nbsp;  Aromatic spices.   Nobel prizes are difficult to come by but it's ok cos&nbsp;don't want one.   Davy crocket was a hermit with a stick.    &nbsp;  Rum makes a superb lubricant.   Ogg vorbis is a superior compression format to mp3 and it's free.   Lead us not into temptation.   Light&nbsp;sources&nbsp;are not to be taken lightly.    &nbsp;  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    &nbsp;  Any thoughts???

      Yes it's true, there are many wildly perplexing and unanswered questions out there.  &nbsp;  Until now that is....  &nbsp;  I have took it upon myself to answer&nbsp;any&nbsp;question that I or&nbsp;anyone esle for that matter may pose, simply by the role of a dice. Confused?&nbsp;Here follows&nbsp;an example...&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Question: If your a wizard why do you wear glasses?    Answer: Ian Rolls&nbsp;"4"   &nbsp;  Now I know what your thinking, your thinking "That Aint Right" Or "He's Crazy-Mad" but I say PROVE ME WRONG!!!  &nbsp;  So I invite you to post your questions in the comments section, and I shall consult "The Mighty Dice Of Truth And Numbers" and lo the secrets of the universe shall be unlocked.  &nbsp;  I am thinking of further exploring this concept by intergrating "Strip Mighty Dice Of Truth And Numbers" into my weekly regime, but I will have to fashion a man-bag cos i currently keep my dice in my pocket.  &nbsp;  Get Quizzing!

      Reet, 1st blog. &nbsp; Well actually this is my second but I wrote the first whilst I was rather drunk and then thought better of it in the morning. It's main subjects&nbsp;were Lionel Richie and virginity. Fill in the gaps yourself. &nbsp; Anyway, welcome to my blog, I may or may not be writing stuff down here, we'll see how it goes. I'm doing this because I used to have a website which I thoroughly enjoyed writing, but it got closed down for reasons unknown to me. I can't be arsed to build another so i'm using this to expell my inner demons.  &nbsp; Sorry.
