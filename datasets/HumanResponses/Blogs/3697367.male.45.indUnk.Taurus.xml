           House Ki’RK, a Star Trek club, began in 1992, isn’t just about a bunch of fans getting together to talk about their favorite episode.   In 1966, Star Trek, the most popular Science Fiction television show ever, began its voyage and brought along thousands of fans. Young and old, from different careers and different walks of life, Star Trek means something different to everyone.      The founders of House Ki’RK, Charles and Kim Smith (Khon Kijo and Epetai Qoj’jev), began their adventure in Star Trek fan clubs years before creating their own. Organizations and clubs can sometimes get political, and the Smiths found many Star Trek fan clubs to have too much politics.      To them, the focus of a fan club is the fans, the people who get out and work hard every day, and need a place to go to be with friends.      When the House Ki’RK was created, it was created by fans and for fans. It became a family, a group of friends, a support unit, for fans of Star Trek who were serious about life.      Many Star Trek organizations and clubs have membership dues. The founding members of House Ki’RK found that money makes things get complicated, and House Ki’RK was about simplicity.      House Ki’RK is a community of people, who each live in communities of their own from all over the United States. Community is important to the House Ki’RK, nurturing and supporting the communities that members live in is important.      House Ki’RK members support, volunteer and participate in many charity organizations. All over the U.S., House Ki’RK members participate in Red Cross blood drives. Beginning this year, the House Ki’RK is working with the Grand Strand Humane Society in Myrtle Beach, SC. Members actively participate in raising money for Breast Cancer Research Foundations.      This year, House Ki’RK will sponsor the Fourth Annual Beach Bash in Myrtle Beach, SC, the location of its base of operations.  Star Trek fans from all over the United States come to Myrtle Beach for a weekend of fun and games. This is about leaving your “real life” worries behind and stepping into another universe. During the weekend, it isn’t strange to see Klingons, Vulcans, and other aliens walking down the beach or around the streets of Myrtle Beach.     Why does the House Ki’RK attract members? Because, for us, it’s personal. It’s about camaraderie and loyalty, honor and courage. It’s not an impersonal organization that wants you for your money. Yes, it is about Star Trek, but more importantly, it’s about friendship and family.   urlLink
