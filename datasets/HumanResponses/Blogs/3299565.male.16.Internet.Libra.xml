      Iron maiden is great metal but not heavy metal, more like peaceful metal. The best music is symphonic dark/black metal in my opinion because it mixes up classical music and metal, making an ideal contrast which expresses itself via both agressive and gental persuasion. This makes symphonic dark metal the ideal music, which makes a true contrast with the repetetive rap which don't really have a melody, and techno which is a little too repetitive. Rock is ok, just a bit too friendly for my liking.

      Archery requires muscles never normally used in the body in the back of the shoulder. It also requires alot of experience patience and precision. That is why I believe archery to be second best to fencing haha ;) not to mention it's also really really cool and fun to do, as well as effective at helping you let out strong emotions.

      Fencing is the best sport in the world: the heat, the passion, the adrenaline, the pain, the sado-masochism of it... Nothing better in the world. From a freudian point of view this sport satisfies the id, ego and super-ego, and is therefor satisfying in every way and it is therefore the best sport in the world.

      preppygoths suck arse. To be a goth you can't just dress goth talk morbid and read Nietszche (however much I admire him..). What you need is the attitude, the mind and maybe the body to match it. Plain and simple: Be a real 'goth'. If you cry or feel bad whenever someone however close to you says anything bad to you, you're worse than them all. Normally you accept it as their opinion and don't react. You're better than that. there's enough gothic material on the net, I'm not going to repeat it, this is just my opinion, don't complain. :)

      Computers rule. Plain and simply. Right now most of us can't imagine a life without computers. We work on them, we play with them, we play with ourselves with them, we can do whatever we want now. What better source of amusement? no wonder people screw around with it! You can find out anything about anyone, do anything to anyone, take away their lifeline, thus kill them... Maybe people who screw around are annoying, but they have the right sort of idea: If you screw around without wanting to destroy completely, it keeps you on your toes and stops people from really wrecking your life. Stop complaining and repair their damage and look out better than before!

      Here are my opinions on the war in Iraq: first of all, I have to express my beleif that the united coalition was wrong to enter Iraq. Afghanistan from my point of view was a good idea, it was obvious that in that country things were pretty messed up, and the people did need a little more freedom. I have said from the beginning that Iraq was a bad idea: this opinion has been showed as correct. First of all, it was obvious that abuse like what has happened was going to occur, because people do that kind of thing in war, war brings the worst out of everyone. The Dutch did it in Yugoslavia, and don't even try to claim that it didn't happen in both world wars. The geneva convention means nothing to the USA and allied forces because the UN won't do anything about this 'privatised war'. I also regret to point out that the Iraqi's are NOT the bad guys, seeing as they were invaded, the war regulations were not met by the opposing force, so the Iraqi people are right to fight back in any way possible, it is their right. Don't pray for my soul, don't complain about me, don't attack me for my opinion, instead take a long hard look at yourself and think wether you really have a right to complain, unless you're an Iraqi. America is being run by a criminal religious extremist group, ready to go as far as they can to get results they want. They don't care what happens to anyone else, they don't beleive in what they preach. They have created a religious war, and for this, I condemn these. Get over yourselves: I don't want to live in your 'land of the free' if this is what it stands for. I live in Western Europe and I'm very happy as I am. How would the American people react if they found out that their government had been overthrown by (for example) Europe? they would feel betrayed and invaded. How do you think the iraqi people feel? Take your troops out, and let THEM make THEIR choice, instead of being hypocritical and saying that you're taking away their past dictatorship and replacing it with your own! and yes, I am using my rights of freedom of speech here, and you therefore can't attack me for this because I haven't produced any illegal material in this statement.

      Girls are an interesting bunch of people. They're great to have around, the picture of human beauty, I have nothing to say that's bad about them except for this. I am a very strong opposer to extreme feminism. This is not because I'm a man, but because I feel if you take it to the extreme (won't read a book by a man, won't get married to a man..) you are being very hypocritical. You are confusing what you stand for and what you are against. Equal rights is what we want, but all humans are equal because Christianity said so. I don't agree with this because in different senses, some are better than others. If you're sexist, I'll be sexist back. If a man gets in trouble for being sexist, so should a woman be. Girls who are extreme feminists are also ugly, missing a little oestrogen I guess.. no wonder noone wants to marry you, and in opposition you choose not to even try...

      these are things that get on my nerves. -sports cars which are meant to go fast but are never used over the speed limit -SUV's, 4x4 cars which are only used for town use. -Women who go around saying that they're equal to men, but go around with a superior look and piss you off coz your a man -preppygoths -people who bitch on me for no reason at all -people who think their superior when I KNOW that they're inferior (no, not all men/women are equal, that's just what people under the influence of slave morality say) -People who judge before knowing -stupid people -people who complain too much about little things just to piss you off -people who comment on what I wear -suicidal people. -people who pick a fight with you when you didn't do anything at all -death -people who pretend they are able with a computer but don't know that notepad is the best tool in windows -people who work more than me just to say that they work more than me -people who lose everything through stupidity -people who don't have a sense of aesthetics -people who say that inner beauty is the true beauty to make themselves feel better -people with loads of money and who spend it on things just because they have names on them. -crappy films -jesus -people who really are racist and don't just make racist jokes -people who dob you in when they've been arseholes to you and you never said anything -people who are shy and don't dare speak publicly -humble people -people who hunt for the fun of it -people who don't agree with me -people who say Nietszche was a bad man -Dickheads! -people who piss me off -stinky people  And there's more to come!

      My Favorite food is foie gras d'oie aux figues on pain d'epices. Which means "stuffed goose liver with figs on spiced up bread". What I like most about it is the consistency and strong taste, but it's not for everyone, Most people find that kind of thing repulsive, but don't realise that the beef you usually eat is stuffed full of hormones, and will make men into women and women into men... literally! beef can make you go sterile! this is why they do beef which doesn't have hormones in it but only in special shops. This is why I'm careful with what I eat, I'm not a pig.

      Death is something that's going to happen to us all. We're all going to die one day, however distant it may be, we will all experience it one day. Why do our parents want us to be in this world if we're just going to die one day? Is it simply our death instincts which will bring us to this? or is it something deeper, more profound? easy: We're going to die because of a fluke in the biological order of life. Our parents are born, we're born, they die, we give birth, we die, and so on and so-forth. Pathetic. We'll all be saddened by this and never be happy due to the fact that we're always scared of dying. Woohoo. The answer to this of course is to end this "spiral of death" right now and all die. Many people have thought of this before me, but do you really inflict this on your children? I therefore urge you: Don't have children, discontinue the race.. Upon observing documentaries on third world countries and foreign aide, I have seen that people die because they have too many children and can't feed them, but if you don't have a child you won't need to feed it and therefore it won't die, and you can keep living happily and do the biggest favour to humanity: you'll end it. Don't feel pity on people with self inflicted pain, This is just stupid. Let them die. (I know it's nasty, but it makes sense and that is why personally I don't give to charities which give to people who inflict suffering on themselves, when it's their own fault.)

      Hello faithful readers of my blogs, here's what I have to say about Apple Macintosh. They SUCK!  What's this bullshit about them being stable? they crash on ME so often compared to PC's I use under redhat linux or win 2k (XP doesn't do full system crashes but the programs run illegal operations and that just gets up my nose..) They also look as ugly as a baboons arse; what is it with the old imacs and their colours? those things piss me off! Only thing good with macs is their power but then again those cost 3000EUR+ to get something that's superior to the higher end PC's.. Also the whole "one button" thing really pisses me off on the mice, and even worse I couldn't find the "on" switch on the emac. Plain and simply, I hate macs.

      'drugs are bad mmkay' any south park fan will remember this comment.  Well, here's my opinion. Drugs are pretty bad IF you abuse them too much! If you take them, i don't honestly care. If most drugs were legalised, governments could control them much better, make them safer, and stop them from killing many people. Saying that legalizing drugs will incite people to use them is definately NOT true. Condoms are available freely throughout the world. If people use them, it's their choice, but it's hardly encouraging people to have sex because we'd do it anyway! if you want to stop drugs, stop condoms. That's what I say. From a macro-economic point of view, the government needs illegal drugs to function: Enter the world of drugs. Who supplies the drugs to the dealers? drug lords. Drug lords need to have inelastic prices for a heroin addict to get his fix. Without these drug lords, we miss out on police, and police is needed to keep people safe from drugs and drug addicts getting violent to get money.  Cops don't want you to stop taking drugs, they want you to keep taking them otherwise they'd be out of the job. Next down the line, countries where certain substances are legal face another problem: All their people are too wasted to work. What we can say, then, is that drugs should be allowed, but employers are to set restrictions as to what their employees are allowed to take so as to stop them going to work stoned, or working under the influence of something, or face being sacked. Restrictions are easy once their legalized, and it would make your economy prosper through drug tourism. Only the people who are needed in police should be kept, the rest can go into other jobs for ex. Military (just as strict)  or office jobs, or maybe an Anti-terrorist force could be created by police men out of the job, so as to defend our countries rather than attack others.

      There's something wrong with school. Violence is getting more frequent and more dangerous towards students turning towards suicide. People are not nice to those who deserve it, and the new fad is to be as bad as possible. I'm not the most innocent person in the world, but what I do do that's 'bad' is not aimed at being bad. It's either aimed at having fun or sedating my painful continuation in the world. Why do people think listening to rap music, dressing in gang colours, pissing people off and just being a butt plug will make you happier? School is alright, the teachers can be a pain, but in general they don't aim at hurting or annoying you, just at helping you. Realise that, and you won't hate them as much. don't invoke trouble, and stop bullying! I know it can be fun but that's teasing. Once it goes beyond a joke and the other person doesn't consider it a joke, it's bullying. Don't piss people off unless they want to be pissed off.

      Part of my anti-bush campain. I think bush has got everything oh-so-wrong. What happened to america when they "voted" for this person, and why didn't you try and force him out of office for cheating! you should have had a war against bush instead, or demanded a re-count (lol).. anyways, your country is being run by a regime worse than that of saddam hussein (go to www.bushin30seconds.com to see some freedom of speech at its best.

      America is a nation that needs the veil lifted off their eyes. I don't want to live in America, I have no wish to (HAHA) America doesn't realise how good life is here. We DO have money, but you don't seem to realise that the reason we don't have cars which have minimum 5.0 liter engines, is that the price is so high. I could buy and drive the biggest american cars for 2 years for less than the smallest european cars. In America, several tens of thousands of people are shot each year. In Belgium, there's less than 100. I don't fear going anywhere in my country, because I'm not gonna get shot. I don't have to pledge allegiance to my country. I can sit when the national anthem is played, hell, I don't even know what my national anthem, and I don't want to. The melting pot theory is big time bull. Muslim people are scared now, they are being oppressed. You don't realise, but america is being run by the most hypocritical system I have ever come accross. Guys, calm down, put some ice on those head to swell them down, COME TO EUROPE and have a look, and you will realise that we are, actually, alot richer than you, economically, and culturally.

      mandrake linux is the best Linux I know of. If you don't know it, download it, and weep at the fact that you used to be happy with windows. Stability, but especially power. With linux, YOU have the power, not it. I don't like to give a computer my information, without being in total control of it. That is why Linux is the best.  Windows is taking over the world, we all know. Right now I'm on a flaming mac so I'm kind of different. Anyways, screw all macs, and screw all windows pc's. That's all i have to say.

Fight club, though, remains a firm favorite. That is an amazing film, I have seen it countless times. Unfortunately, not many  people like it because it's too confusing. Guys, Get a grip.

      Wow big deal. Who gives a damn if you got a 4x4. Congratulations, you have a killing machine. You kill the astmosphere with it killing countless animals and plants, you kill people who you hit instantly: bull bars are at the exact height of a five year old childs head, and at any speed is able to kill the child you hit, or very very badly damage at least any person you hit. This is why I have created S:DOS. Society for the Destruction Of Suv's, (any windows fan will find it clever) Just because I'm stuck in my room on the PC every moment of the day, DOESN'T mean I don't notice these things. I even use my PC in the car ALOT, so I do have a view of the world. SUV's are dumb. There is no use in them, get yourself a nicer car you cheap little arses, or get something smaller. Why are people so stupid. And what is it about this whole "Bling Bling" bullshit? why is an SUV more dominant on the roads than a fuckin Rolls Royce? you guys, the ones with suv's and women aswell, you can just bite me!

      This is why I hate Warewolf's rant page. First of all, do I have any idea about anything I'm talking about in here, or even preaching? NO! do I actually like anything or anyone? NO! do I look like I care what people think about me? NO! Why is it I look like such an uncaring little kid? It's simple: I see things people don't usually see, because I am my own god. I make up the rules in my world. I built my world from scratch and it's a world which I enjoy living in. This blog is a bit like "my" world. random, I am in charge, noone can do anything to get to me. The name warewolf symbolises all of this: I am in my own world, but I am not like others. That is why I'm a warewolf and not a werewolf.

      Junk mail is THE most annoying thing on the internet. If there is one thing I could do without, junk mail would be it. Why do people have to send emails which are in fact chain letters? I rarely got a chain letter in the post, in ancient times when they sent guys around with messages, did they send things like "come to my place, you can buy a bigger penis!"? NO! why do they suddenly have to turn up online? why do people send the same jokes over and over? what interest is there in doing all this? it's crazy guys, get over yourselves and stop filling up my email inbox! and now they have junk boxes which are even worse because you have to check them so often to make sure nothing got put in by accident! and how about these porn ones. "newly found lesbians" "5 XXX dvd's for $5!" WHY?? if I really wanted porn, I'd go looking for it, and I wouldn't be bothered to get them through email (it would be easier for me). If I wanted a bigger penis or bigger breasts, I would be a pretty sad person with no self confidence. I know there's laws to stop spamming, but how about getting them ENFORCED?   An answer: Stop reading these emails, make sure you don't respond to any of them, and this practice will slowly die out.

      One thing I supremely detest is people who marvel over other peoples cars. you know the type, "WOW! A FERARRI!" "WOW! A NEW MERCEDES!" "WOW A LAMBO!". Guys, calm down, it's not your car. It's someone elses, and dreams can't lead your life. Calm down, get over it. Knowing everything there is to know about cars isn't my idea of a "good" thing (unless you're a mechanic, then I hope you know everything there is to know about cars). It's got to such a point that guys are going to the bathroom with car magazines. Cars are the new porn, and that is NOT a good thing! calm down and stop it, it's not a good thing. If you recognise yourself in this description, then you can just bugger off and die.

      Natural selection is the way forward. Let everyone who doesn't deserve to live die of not being able to get food or water. Children who cry should be beaten to a pulp, and we should allow for nature to take the weak and keep the strong. Aditionally, we should live in a world of the elite, to create the ultimate being: clever, beautiful, genetically perfect. This isn't nazism: I don't think a particular type of person should be killed off, I don't think people should be castrated to stop creating inferior beings: I think that the ones who aren't able to live correctly should get the same chances as others, get fed etc. and treated just like any other people. I hate little kids. Babies are NOT always beautiful, some are in fact quite repulsive. On the subject of children, they're NOT all clever! some are, as their looks, VERY dumb. Same goes to adults, don't be blind, don't be stupid.

      Mixing groups of friends is the worst thing you can do. My experience has shown that if I introduce people I'm friends with to people who get on my nerves, the people I was friends with end up getting on my nerves. Why does this happen? plain and simply, I act differently with different people (I'm not the only one) and in the end I don't know how to act because I feel so fuckin shit. look people, don't bug people to meet their friends, it screws up your friendship and you get distant. People reading this, if you recognise this situation as yours, think again next time you try and convince someone to introduce you to the people they hatem or even the people they don't mind too much.

      Yesterday someone who'd been pissing me off for ages and saying "you're so weak, if someone hits you, you'd break into tiny little pieces"... but WAIT! this guy just got a ball in his hand, and blacked out + broke his arm! look who's the weak one! it's called unanticipated revenge and is the best sort. (I laughed in his face, then hit a wall hard with my hand just to show that  can do it without breaking and he can't HEHE) neways, get revenge! but serve it cold if you do... ;)
