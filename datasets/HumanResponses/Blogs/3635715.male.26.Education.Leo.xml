      The best part about being young and single is being able to travel.  Being a coach and having the summer off allows me to travel a lot and I plan to take full advantage of it.  So as of six tomorrow morning I am heading towards Mount Rushmore for the 4th of July, and then on to Yellowstone National Park for a few days.  I don't know if anything can beat Yosemite, but Mount Rushmore and fireworks, along with another great national park should be a lot of fun.  Tomorrow night I will be in Kansas City for a baseball game.  This will make the sixth new ballpark I have seen this summer.  Good thing I love baseball.  So I hope everyone enjoys the 4th.  Drinks lots of beer and give a toast to Willie wherever you may be.  Hope to have some posts from the road.  If not the details will follow in a week.

      As I said earlier, I almost didn't make it to the top of Half Dome.  When I made it to the cables going up I froze.  Straight up the side of the dome are cables in which you have to pull yourself up the last 200 yards of the hike.  Now I am scared to death of heights.  I can hardly get up on the roof of my house.    So I get to the base of the cables and decide there is no way I can make it up.  You have to share these cables with the people coming down also.  So I am ready to turn back when the group I was with starts yelling for me to come on.  At first I told them no way, but I finally decided if I was going to make this long hike I might as well finish it.  One of the girls, Sarah, helped talk me up the cables.  Without her I might not have made it up.  Laugh all you want that I had to get a girl to help me up Half Dome, but if you ever see those cables you'll get the idea.  Once I was at the top I took my boots off and roamed around.  It's amazing how flat it is up top, and you have a great view all around.  My pictures turned out a little hazy, but they couldn't do justice to the top anyway.  So going down seemed like it took forever.  Once again Sarah helped me down and I finally made it to the bottom.  Although it is easier on the lungs going down, the mental game gets a lot tougher.    Words and pictures can't describe the feeling of hiking to the top of Half Dome.  Until you've been there and done that no one can fully appreciate what you have done.  David conquered Half Dome when he was little so he was able to understand my excitement.  Then again I don't know how he did it at that age.  So Half Dome will now go down as one of my major personal accomplishments.  Tomorrow I leave for Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park.  More hiking and fun to come.

      I think I finally caught up on my sleep so here are the details of the California trip.  Monday:  Made it to San Diego and caught the Padres game at PETCO Park.  I really like the stadium, very cozy, and I had great seats.  The players there were great to the little kids during BP, and the staff was as nice as they could be.  I also ate the biggest hotdogs I have ever seen there for only five dollars.  So I leave the Padres game thinking I will get past LA on my way to Yosemite.  It's about a seven hour drive and it's already 9:30.  Well, seven hours later I pull into my hotel at Yosemite and take a three hour power nap before taking on Half Dome.  Tuesday:  The hike up to Half Dome.  This is something that you can't explain or understand until you have done it.  It is 18 miles round trip and it will kick your ass.  I'm not in the best shape either so it made for a long hike.  I started at ten in the morning, finally got back to the car at midnight.  All on three hours sleep.  The hike was beautiful the entire way, but there were a few times I thought about turning back.  No sleep and a tough hike will do that to a man.  I met some great people on the way and more will come about them later.  I finally made it to the top and back, and back to the hotel for some sleep.  The rest of the trip was spent hiking in the park and hanging out on the beach with my family.  I also made it to a Dodgers game which was great.  Nice old California ballpark.  I will get into more details about Half Dome later and how I almost didn't make it to the top.  For now here are some more pics.

      Well I made it back from California in one piece.  It was a great trip that I will never forget.  I made it to the top of Half Dome and back down in one piece, and there will be details to follow.  I am beat down tired so the details will be up tomorrow.

      I have decided to skip out on the Clinton book stop.  Do I really want to waste a day in California waiting to get a quick handshake and a book autographed?  It would be interesting, but too much other stuff to see.  So Monday will be all San Diego, with the trip to the Reagan Library taking place on Friday after one last stroll through Yosemite that morning.

      Well I am all packed and ready to head out tomorrow morning.  I'm not sure how often, if ever I will update on this trip, but here is what I am going to be doing the next week.  Monday:  Fly into San Diego and then on to  urlLink The Reagan Presidential Library .  That night I will be back in San Diego for a Padres game at PETCO Park.  Tuesday:  Yosemite National Park.  The first day I will attempt to hike up to the top of Half Dome, the most visible structure in Yosemite.  The last 900 feet you must use cables to pull yourself up.  Lets hope I make this hike in one piece.  Wednesday:  More Yosemite with many smaller hikes in store.  Thursday:  More hiking and taking in the beauty of the park.  Friday:  Leave Yosemite and head for L.A. to see  urlLink President Bill Clinton  and get a book signed.  Never thought I would waste my time and do this, but how often to you get to meet a former president?  After meeting Bill, it is on to San Clemente to meet my folks.  Saturday, Sunday:  Spend some time on the beach, do a little reading, and do some relaxing.    Monday:  Catch a flight back to DFW, and do laundry for two days before I turn around and head to Mount Rushmore.  So lots to see in a weeks time but it should be fun.  To the three or four people who read this, I'll see you next week!

      Dave and I went out for a beer last night and spent most of the time discussing our recent trip to the east coast, and my trip tomorrow to the west coast.  I had never seen New York City until a few weeks ago and it was a sight to be seen.  The more I thought about it though I realized I am a west coast person.  Dave is east coast, I'm west coast.    The big city life isn't for me.  I would rather hike in Zion than wander around Times Square in New York.  Both are great, but the connection you feel when on a long hike with just you and your thoughts is unmatched.    Within the past year I have gotten on a big  urlLink national parks  kick.  Lindsey and I went to the  urlLink Grand Canyon  last summer, and on my spring break I made it to  urlLink Zion National Park ,  urlLink Bryce Canyon National Park , and finally the Grand Canyon.  So now the summer is here and tomorrow I will be flying into San Diego and driving up to spend a few days at  urlLink Yosemite National Park .  I will be gone  a week, and then after that I am heading to  urlLink Mount Rushmore  for the 4th of July, and then on to  urlLink Yellowstone National Park  and the  urlLink Grand Tetons .  This is a cheap way to spend a vacation, and the views you see will leave you with a thousand memories.  Pictures don't do it justice, but Bryce Canyon was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen.  And the hike to the bottom in the snow is something I will never forget.  Later today I will post my schedule for the week.  I will be seeing lots of different things and hope to make a few posts from the road.

      It has been exactly one week since I placed a call for my new TIVO box, and still no box.  I am fortunate that David and I have enough DVDs between the two of us to start our own small rental store.  So the movie for today(so far)was Almost Famous.  It's been a while since I have seen this movie but it still ranks up there in my top five, maybe of all time.  And if I had a greater knowledge of music like Dave, I would probably enjoy it even more.  I'm not going to dive into a review of the film, you've all seen it, know it's greatness, and if you haven't seen it stop reading and go rent it right now.  I just felt like reminding everyone of what a well made movie this was.  In the next day or so, I will be filling in the two or three people who read this about my California adventure I will be leaving for on Monday.  Now it's off to iron out the details of the trip.

      I just got back from seeing  urlLink Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story  with my brother.  It had to be one of the funniest things I have seen in a while.  Now there is different types of funny, but this was one of those movies that you just have to take it for what it's worth.  90 minutes of stupid, slapstick comedy, where you just sit back and enjoy.  I don't need to tell you what happens but there are a few thoughts on the movie I would like to share.   Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn seemed to work really well together.  As I am sure you have seen in the previews, Stiller is over the top while Vaughn steps back and watches Stiller make a fool of himself.  This had it's moments but the funny man here was once again Rip Torn.  I talked about his greatness in The Larry Sanders Show, and he's at it again in Dodgeball.  The delivery by Torn is perfect, and I enjoyed his screen time more than the rest of the cast.    Dodgeball is not a great movie by any stretch, but if you are wanting some silly fun this is the movie for you.  I have no problems giving this movie my approval, and all should go check it out. Pay close attention to Jason Batemans bit part.  It looks like he is having too much fun on the Ocho!

      Travis invited me to join him and some guys in a game of basketball last night.  This was the first time in a long time that I have gotten out there and played a little.  My friend Jason and I were talking after one game how the coach in me came out some while we were playing.  Habit I guess now that as I coach I have to point out the mistakes my kids make and try and help them fix it.  I use to want to win no matter what.  I hated to lose and I still do.  Since I have become a coach though I have had to settle down a little.  I mean come on, you really can't win them all, and if I beat myself up over every loss I will be dead before I hit 30.  So back to last night.  I really did enjoy myself, but at times I realized why I didn't miss these games too much.  Everybody is different, and everyone has a different approach to playing ball, but I am not going to get mad if I get beat in a 4-on-4 game of basketball.  I'm not going to complain about every little foul call.  I have played in some gyms where nothing was called period.  If you called a little foul they put you into the wall the next time you had the ball.  My time has passed doing all these things, but I use to be right there with the best of them complaining about every little thing going on in the game.  But now the only time I will get mad is if Travis and Jason ruin my beautiful assist by missing a lay-up.  I appreciate Travis inviting me to play, and I am looking forward to many more games with these guys.

      The past few months I have gotten on a big health kick.  I am proud to say that I have cut 90% of the fast food out of my life and I am eating much better.  To go along with this I have been jogging everyday.  It started slowly but I am up to four miles a day.  It is addictive really, I can't miss a day now.  When Dave and I went on our adventure on the east coast a few weeks ago I would get up in the morning and just run around the motel parking lot if I had to.  What can I say, I was getting too fat and I have two very large trips to Yosemite National Park and Yellowstone National Park I had to get ready for.  So where is this going?  I was jogging this morning and a young man stopped me about three miles in.  He was probably 28 or so, and commented that he sees me running by his place everyday.  He then goes into a five minute spill about how he has been saved by God and needs to get back into shape.  Kind of a weird combination but the guy seemed nice enough.  Then came the reason he was saved.  He informed me that he had gone crazy, destroying his house, taking drugs and getting in numerous fights at the bars.  But the medication had saved his head and God had saved his soul.  The guy just meet me and tells me how crazy he was and that he needs to get back in shape.  I'm glad this young man was saved, but I think I need to find a new jogging route and find someone besides him to jog with everyday.

      There are many people out there who hate the NBA.  My friend Jason is one of them I assume by his post about the NBA.  According to  urlLink Jason  there is "hardly any strategy".  Now being a basketball coach this got under my skin a little.  I can understand watching the NBA and thinking there isn't much strategy.  The one-on-one stuff kills me at times, but these finals showed us a true team concept by Detroit.  There was plenty of strategy and if you think the end of Game 2 lacked drama I guess the exciting game of baseball is for you.  The NBA may have a lot wrong with it, but boring it isn't.    Don't get me wrong I love baseball, and enjoy watching football more than anything else, but to say basketball lacks strategy and has no drama is a bit of a stretch.  Looking forward to football season, but at the same time keeping my fingers crossed that next years NBA Finals will be as entertaining.   urlLink Here  is what Travis had to say about the Laker soap opera.  Check it out.  Good stuff.

      I have way too much time on my hands.  Being a coach and having the summer off is nice, but there just isn't much to do in the middle of the day.  And I still have no Tivo so I am forced to dive into my DVD collection.  I just finished watching a few episodes of the Larry Sanders show.  This is one of the few shows that can make me laugh out loud numerous times each episode.  I don't think this show gets near enough credit.  Garry Shandling has a delivery some people might not like, but the combination of him and Rip Torn makes this show funny every time I watch it.  To the few people out there that read this blog, let me know of some other television shows that don't get their due.  This one is at the top of my list.

      You may hate the NBA and everything it stands for, but if you tuned out of these finals you missed a hell of a show.  The Detroit Pistons and their incredible defense destroyed the Lakers and I enjoyed every minute of it.  I am a basketball coach so I live for good defense.  I would rather see Ben Wallace pull down 20 boards than see Kobe Bryant score 50 points.  It really was a fun series to watch, if for nothing more than seeing the Lakers get hammered.

      The photo below was just a test run to see if I was smart enough to post a picture on here.  The photo was taken in California last year when my friend Lindsey and I made a big road trip.  I will be heading back to California on Monday to hike in Yosemite National Park.  On to figuring out how to post links to other peoples blogs who actually say something interesting.

      Growing up in a small town does have it's benefits believe it or not.  25 years later I still live near where I grow up and I love every minute of it.  Sure I'm out in the middle of the sticks, and it takes a thirty minute drive to get a beer, but some things make it all worth it.  One is the breakfast club.  The breakfast club is a group of old men including my dad, that meet at six every morning to "shoot the shit", as they like to say. Use to, they would meet in small cafe and try to solve the worlds problems.  They all sat at a long table and you had to be invited to sit there or be a blood relative like myself.  I hated going in as a kid, but as I grew up I enjoyed the time spent in the cafe.  There were all sorts of folks that gathered there every morning.  You had a vet, a rancher, a judge, a hole digger, a guy who can shoe your horse, a guy who recycled computers for a living, and a former Dallas Cowboy to name a few.  By going to the cafe I was able to get a good summer job, get out of a few minor traffic tickets, and meet some of the greatest Dallas Cowboys to ever play the game.  Where am I going with all this??  Well the cafe closed down about six months ago.  Since then the breakfast club has been bouncing around trying to settle into a new place.  I decided to go drink some coffee with my dad this morning and sad to say, it was only him and another guy at the cafe.  It was sad because these guys use to all be there everyday.  My dad says Saturdays are better, but it's still not the same.  The old cafe is opening back up in July, so there is hope that the breakfast club will return to full force, and that I can continue my small town education that so many people look down their noses at.

      Since I have no Tivo at the moment, I have spent a lot of time surfing the web.  Numerous stories have caught my eye today, but there was one that just made me crazy.  On ESPN.com today there was an article about a $500 dollar pack of basketball cards.  That's right, $500 dollars for one pack of cards.  The name of the cards are Upper Deck's 2003-04 Exquisite Collection Basketball series.  There are five cards per pack.  The catch is there is one signed, jersey-swatched card, numbered to no more than 100.    I can remember the days of collecting all sorts of cards and thinking a dollar a pack was high.  Dave and I use to hit all the card shows and have a good time.  My collecting cards days are over, but I feel bad for the kids trying to collect today.  Try collecting the card of your favorite player.  There may be 20 cards each year of the same player.  Kids today don't stand a chance.  I went to a card show a few months ago to receive a five dollar autograph from the great Drew Pearson.  Great might be a stretch, but while I was there I bet I didn't see a hundred kids there.  All adults, barely a young boy to be seen.  This isn't my card collecting days anymore that's for sure.

      Since I am new to the world of the blog, it might take a while for me to get everything up that I want.  So until then we will all have to live with the basics.  There will be links to some of my favorite pages on the web, as well as all my good friends who will have plenty more to write about than I will.  But since it is the summer and I have too much free time on my hands, you will have to put up with numerous posts about nothing.

      I have had a lot going on this week, no time for posts.  The summer is winding down for me, and I start back to school with meetings next week.  A couple of things I wanted to touch on from this week:  -Are the good times over?  The Rangers are half a game ahead of Oakland after last nights great come from behind victory, but can they hold on?  A win tonight would be huge, but at this time the Rangers made no moves to get better.  I don't have a big problem with this, at least they aren't giving up a lot for someone who may not be back next year.  -Democratic National Convention.  I didn't watch much, mainly just Kerry.  I was impressed with his speech.  I was happy to see him go after Bush some, it seems like Kerry is ready to fight fire with fire.  I am also tired of people complaining that Kerry skimmed over his time in Congress.  Some say he didn't talk enough about it, allowing only two to three lines about it during his speech.  At least Kerry has a political background, more than we can say about Bush, unless being part owner of the Texas Rangers counts.  Dave has a good post about the balloon crisis too.  Check it out.  -Moving out.  Dave and I will be moving to the Bedford area within the next month.  The 45 minute drive to get to work was starting to wear me out.  My bills will go up, but saving almost three hours a day in drive time after a fifteen hour day doesn't make me feel too bad about paying a little more to live closer.  We will be moving into a pretty big house that will be only three miles from work.  And now that I have a big yard, I will be getting a dog.  Any suggestions on what type of dog would be appreciated.    I have a very boring night ahead of me as of right now, but the rest will be nice after a long week.  Just sit back and try to find something worth a damn to watch on tonight on the dish.

      Dave and I checked out the Old 97's last night at The Gypsy Tea Room in Dallas.  This was the first time I had ever seen the Old 97's live, and it's the first concert I had been to in forever.  I'm happy to say that these guys don't disappoint live.  I wasn't a huge fan of the albums that Dave let me listen to, but after being there live, I am sold on the greatness of the Old 97's.    The set lasted a couple of hours, and the energy was fantastic.  The band really seemed into it to me, and the audience fed off that electricity.  The crowd was large, the night before was sold out, but the great thing was it wasn't too hard to get around and get beer.  Lots of young kids there also.  I had forgotten about the dreaded double X they put on both your hands.  I don't miss those days.  So check these guys out live if you ever get the chance, they put on a hell of a show.  There is something about a good concert that gets me excited.  Lots of things have to go right, like the right crowd, good sound system, and of course a great band.  But when all of those things come together, there is nothing that beats a live show.  I told Dave I am going to have to keep an eye out for more concerts to attend.  Like Dave said, they aren't many better ways to blow twenty bucks than seeing a great live show.   urlLink Here  is a link to the pics from the show.

      I had a lot going on this weekend so I better catch up on my posts.&nbsp;   Saturday a good friend of mine, and a buddy I coach with got married.&nbsp; It was a beautiful wedding and I am very happy for the two of them.&nbsp; Now for a couple of observations from that day.   First, I was an usher for the first time and hated it.&nbsp; People get really picky about where they want to sit, and when you have to ask people to move down away from the aisle they look at you like you just shot their dog.&nbsp; It wasn't a big church, everybody could see fine, get over it.   Cash bar.&nbsp; Big mistake.&nbsp; The reception was held at a very nice country club in Fort Worth, and of course you had to buy the beer from them, my friends couldn't provide their own for the wedding.&nbsp; So beer ends up costing 3.50 a pop.&nbsp; I don't mind paying that at a bar, but I do have a problem giving that much money for a beer at a country club during a wedding.&nbsp; At least it kept me from drinking very much.&nbsp; If I ever decide to get married, I will provide the beer and wine for all.&nbsp; Even if that means we have to have the reception in a barn.   Dave and I went and saw the Old 97's last night at the Gypsy tea Room in Dallas.&nbsp; Great show, and I will have more on that later.   I am also going to post some links to my pictures and other places of interest to me later.&nbsp;

      I don't get out to the movies near as much as I use to.&nbsp; There are three or four movies out now that I need to go see, but the one movie I am looking forward to is  urlLink Garden State .   The buzz around this movie is great, and being a fan of Scrubs I would be willing to give it a chance anyway because it was written, directed, and stars Zach Braff, who also stars in Scrubs.&nbsp; They showed the trailer last night during the Scrubs marathon on NBC, and it looks great.&nbsp; It's amazing what a great trailer can do to people and get them excited about a movie.&nbsp; I love trailers like this one, which don't give away all the plot points, and moves at a good pace with great music.&nbsp;   This movie has been compared to Beautiful Girls which was also a great film that I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it already.&nbsp; Both also&nbsp;have the very talented Natalie Portman, who besides the Star Wars&nbsp;movies, has starred in some very good movies.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if you want another  urlLink blog to read , Braff also has one to check out, mainly talking about the movie, but some other good posts.  So there is my pick for a movie you must go see.&nbsp; I rarely, if ever give my stamp of approval to a movie before I see it, but I think this movie won't disappoint.&nbsp;

      Here are some Friday morning thoughts for you to browse:   - urlLink Travis  has a great post from yesterday you need to check out.&nbsp; As stupid as it sounds it deals with the 80's movie Teen Wolf.&nbsp; I still can't believe it so check it out for yourself.   -Speaking of Teen Wolf, I watched it last night and enjoyed it a lot.&nbsp; Stupid 80's movie but come on, it's a lot of fun.&nbsp; Coach Bobby Finstock steals the show for me and reminds me of my old junior high coach.&nbsp; The advice he gives Scotty is priceless, and my coach also gave me some words of wisdom that I will never forget.&nbsp; They were "The woman you marry must be a good cook and look good without makeup. Everything else will take care of itself Brown."&nbsp; Words I will always remember.&nbsp; I never got the " Great game out there today.&nbsp; You want a thigh or a wing or something?" from my coach after a game though.   -My meetings are almost over.&nbsp; One more bus driving meeting to go tonight.&nbsp; This class really wears me out.   -I have a wedding this weekend.&nbsp; I'm not getting married, a guy I coach with is.&nbsp; I am an usher, so I had to get the tux and all.&nbsp; 4:30 wedding, it's going to be nice and hot tomorrow.&nbsp;   -Half Dome again.&nbsp; I have received an e-mail from one of my girls from the trip, and Lauren and Lindsey left me a comment.&nbsp; I was starting to wonder what had happened to these kids, so it was good to hear from them.&nbsp; Keep posting comments, and e-mail me so we can catch up.&nbsp; And tell that little band geek Sarah to shoot me an e-mail.&nbsp;   That's all for now, I can't find the good stuff like Travis.&nbsp; Just my random, boring thoughts for you.&nbsp;

      I won't be able to watch this tonight but I thought I would take this moment to tell everybody to watch  urlLink Scrubs  on NBC tonight.&nbsp; They are running four episodes back-to-back tonight and it is worth watching if you have nothing else going on.&nbsp; And if you do TiVo them because Scrubs is by far the best show on TV these days.   Scrubs will be entering it's fourth season in August and there was some debate if it would make it.&nbsp; Scrubs and shows like Arrested Development are great, but they have had a hard time finding an audience.&nbsp; Scrubs was bumped from it's prime Thursday night spot for the reality show The Apprentice.&nbsp; I'm glad both these shows have been picked up for next season because they deserve to be watched.&nbsp; Too much reality TV out there these days, and the smart new shows are being forgotten.&nbsp; I am proud to say I have never watched an episode of any reality show ever.&nbsp; Why do I want to watch somebody make an ass out of themselves on TV?&nbsp;   My TiVo will be working tonight while I am gone to more meetings.&nbsp; Turn off whatever reality show might be on tonight and check out this well written show.&nbsp; Funny and smart on TV these days is rare, so enjoy Scrubs while you can.

      I couldn't believe  urlLink this article  when I read it.&nbsp; Inmates at a jail in Rogersville, Tennessee went on two beer runs when the cell doors were left open.&nbsp; They didn't make just one beer run, but two.&nbsp; Supposedly the inmates thought they wouldn't get charged with escape if they came back.&nbsp; I guess these guys really felt like a beer.&nbsp; The article also talked about the fact that they don't have enough prison uniforms to go around, so some of the inmates wear their street clothes.&nbsp; This is why nobody at the store said anything about the men buying beer, they looked like regular guys off the street.&nbsp; Not enough prision uniforms?&nbsp; Something wrong with that picture?&nbsp; At least the guys brought back enough beer for some of their buddies.&nbsp; Why escape when you can enjoy a nice cold beer in prison with your friends?&nbsp; Check out the story, good for a laugh.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I know I have gone on and on about Half Dome to all my friends.&nbsp; It is something I am very proud of, especially since I am scared to death of heights.&nbsp; I had to make Dave get on the roof of our house to hook up our Directv a few months ago.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It was a great rush once I got to the top.&nbsp; I took off my boots, walked around, and just soaked it all in.&nbsp; I was late getting there so there was only about ten people total up there, and I was the last one down.&nbsp; I'm not sure how much I would have enjoyed it if it would have been packed on the top.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I plan to go back next summer to Yosemite and do the hike again.&nbsp; I swore to myself I would never do it again, but now I'm ready for more.&nbsp; I'll get a much earlier start, and hopefully there will be some cute girls there again to get me to the top.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The reason for this update was because CNN.com ran an article about  urlLink the climb to Half Dome  and it made me realize what an accomplishment this was for me.&nbsp; Check it out, it will give you a little more insight on what my trip to the top of Half Dome was like.

      Boy do I hate meetings.&nbsp; I have a full week of them, and I am already sick of it.&nbsp; The football meetings didn't go too bad.&nbsp; It was good to catch up with some guys I haven't seen all summer.&nbsp; Football meetings are a lot like being back in school.&nbsp; Somebody goes up front, lectures, and then they throw out questions to see if you get it.&nbsp; I'm a little insulted because I'm an adult now and don't need to be quizzed like a child.&nbsp; The main reason I say this though is because I hate getting a question wrong in front of my peers.&nbsp; I hate being put on the spot, and even though I will know the answer I might spit out the wrong one for no reason.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Bus driving safety.&nbsp; This is the biggest beating of the two.&nbsp; From 5-9 I have to listen to a lady talk about all the horrible things that go wrong while driving a bus.&nbsp; If I wasn't nervous enough already having to drive the yellow dog.&nbsp; Oh well, at least I have time to study up on the football questions I will be asked tomorrow.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I guess it is time to break down and buy an iPod.&nbsp; Apple has just come out with a  urlLink new generation  of the iPod which is cheaper and the battery life is longer.  &nbsp;  My roommate Dave has been telling me to buy one ever since he got his for Christmas.&nbsp; They are pretty pricey, but they just went down by a hundred bucks so it looks like it's time.&nbsp; I don't have 10,000 songs on my computer anyway so I'll go with the middle of the road iPod.&nbsp; I won't go out to purchase one until after my birthday in early August, and even then who knows if I can find one at Best Buy.&nbsp; The only reason I am stuck with Best Buy is because I already have numerous gift certificates from there for my birthday and I need to use them on the iPod.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nothing else to report, on my way to meetings shortly.

      A few quick hits from this weekend.  &nbsp;  -I finished an entire season of my new game NCAA Football 2005.&nbsp; What can I say, there wasn't much to do during the day.&nbsp; I am starting to get a little more involved in the game, but will hold off until Travis can hook me up with the rosters.  &nbsp;  -I saw Anchorman last night with a few friends of mine.&nbsp; I don't know what I was expecting, but all three of us left the movie pretty disappointed.&nbsp; It had it's moments, but overall not very funny.&nbsp; I can't put my finger on it, but I kept looking at my watch to see when the damn thing was going to be over.&nbsp; I couldn't recommend this movie at eight dollars, or whatever it costs to see it at night.&nbsp; Check it out during the day or on video.&nbsp; Not bad, just did nothing for me.  &nbsp;  -I will spend the rest of the night checking out two shows on HBO I have never seen.&nbsp; The first is the new show  urlLink Entourage .&nbsp; I really don't know much about it, but I figured it's an original series from HBO so it's worth a shot.&nbsp; After that is the first episode of season two of  urlLink Da Ali G Show .&nbsp; My buddy Travis said this was a great show so I am going to check it out.&nbsp; And during both shows I will be pretending to study my football playbook since meetings start tomorrow.  &nbsp;  -Sounds like  urlLink Dave  is having a good time in Seattle.&nbsp; I have enjoyed some down time from all my traveling this summer.&nbsp; Sometimes it's nice to just sit and relax with nowhere to go.&nbsp; Then again I would love to be on the trip with Dave seeing some places I have never seen before.  &nbsp;  -Posts will probably slow to a trickle this week.&nbsp; I will be in meetings from 1-9 everyday and then home to catch some sleep.&nbsp; I have a wedding this weekend also.&nbsp; First of all I am an usher so there goes $100 dollars for a tux.&nbsp; And I'm not a fan of summer weddings, don't know why.&nbsp; So on top of meetings and wedding responsibilities I will be pretty busy.&nbsp; Good thing I have nothing exciting to write about.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well I am off to study.&nbsp; Probably not, but I'll give it a shot.&nbsp; I could never make it in college again that's for sure.

      I picked up NCAA Football 2005 for Playsation 2 last night.&nbsp; I woke up this morning and played my first game.&nbsp; There are some new tricks to the game but nothing too special.&nbsp; My first game ended with the final score of Texas A&amp;M 7-Texas Tech 6.&nbsp; Myself playing with my beloved Aggies.  &nbsp;  This game like all others will just take some getting use to.&nbsp; I was 4-18 passing for 98 yards and a TD.&nbsp; I know Reggie isn't a great QB, but too many dropped passes in the game.&nbsp; Also A&amp;M probably won't be worth a damn once I start a dynasty.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I played some with the dynasty and you can bench kids if they skip class, and I hear you can offer cars in the recruiting season.&nbsp; All nice touches, because the recruiting is the part I enjoy the most.  &nbsp;  My roommate Dave has sworn not to play these games anymore.&nbsp; I think he feels like it's a waste of time.&nbsp; We all waste time everyday, some just do it in different ways.&nbsp; The only reason I mention Dave is because I miss the days of Dave and I getting pissed about a game that doesn't mean anything.&nbsp; If any of his fellow UT friends can give me some insight about why he has given up on the game let me know.&nbsp; In college we use to play this game for hours on end instead of studying.&nbsp; I hope to get out to see Travis this weekend and recreate these moments just for a little while.

      More quick hits........  -I have never been as bored as I was last night.  Called around, most of my friends were out of town or weren't up to anything.  So with nothing on TV I decided to rent Eurotrip on pay-per-view.  I figured it was worth three bucks, but it wasn't.  Don't waste your time.  Luckily I had plenty of time to kill last night so it wasn't a big deal.  -A few nights ago I went out for a beer with  urlLink David ,  urlLink Travis , and  urlLink Jason .  I had a great time, it was Monday night, nobody was out, and we could just sit and shoot the shit.  There are those nights that I love a big crowd and scenery at the bar, but Monday I was content with the conversation.  The major topic that sticks out from that night was the best sports movie ever.  Dave and Jason picked Bull Durham, Travis and I picked Hoosiers.  Both are great movies but I guess being a coach I pull more for the Hoosiers story.  Both great movies that I will probably watch again today.  -NCAA Football 2005 on X-Box.  My brother bought this game when it came out and I went over to play it yesterday while he was working.  I never play X-Box so I didn't play too long.  The controller whips me so I left without seeing much.  So my brother calls me last night and tells me he is taking it back.  He doesn't like it.  I figured he was the only guy in America to think this, but the more I have read about it online, the more gripes I am seeing about the X-Box version.  Action slows down, hard to pass, the new crowd noise and movement can give you motion sickness, ect.  I'll still buy it for playstation in a few weeks, just thought I would throw that out.  -Road trips.  I have taken two road trips this summer, one to the east coast, one to the west and Yellowstone.  Like I said before, give me the west over the east any day.  Well Dave is headed for Seattle and it sounds like he is having a good time already.  The two drives east and west are so different, and Dave is finally starting to realize how different they are.  Reading Dave go on and on made me wish I was with him to check it all out.

      Not much to report on this early in the day but here are a few thoughts.  -ESPN News has been showing clips of the Division 1 football player who is testifying to Congress about steroid use.  The player is hidden behind a plate of class and his voice has been altered in that creepy computer generated voice.  No real news from this yet, but that voice creeps me out every time I hear it.  -The All-Star game last night was fun to watch, at least the first inning.  I found some humor in the Rocket getting shelled in his new home park.  And having Alfonso Soriano win the MVP was good to see.  The conspiracy theories are already out that Piazza tipped the batters on what Clemens was going to throw.  Nice thought, but come on now.  -My friend  urlLink David  made it to Durango last night on his way to Seattle.  Make sure to check out his daily posts from the road.  This is a trip I would have enjoyed being a part of, but three vacations, no money, and meetings all next week made this impossible for me to tag along.  I'll make it up to Seattle soon to see Lindsey, but until then I will have to rely on Dave to tell me all about it.  -Speaking of meetings.  The worst part of being a coach is all the football meetings I have to sit in on.  Starting next Monday we have football meetings everyday from 1-7.  Six hours a day for four days?  Give me a break.  This is why I will never be a high school football coach.  Too many hours, too many meeting.  And on top of this I have to take a 20 hour bus driving safety course next week.  So I will sit through these football meetings from 1-4:30, then head to bus driving school from 5-9.  I see my summer coming to an end very quickly.  -My brother just bought NCAA Football 2005 for X-Box.  I hope to head over there today or tomorrow to check it out.    That's all for now, maybe I will have something better to write about later.

      Must be a slow news day when a top story is that former NFL coach Mike Ditka is considering running for a Senate seat.  Check out  urlLink DraftDitka.com  for all the information.    Ditka would be just another former athlete throwing his hat in the political ring.  Sports Illustrated last week showed just how many former athletes and coaches were in politics in their "Where Are They Now" special.  Sounds like Ditka has his work cut out for him considering his wife said she would divorce him if he ran, and he might not even be registered to vote in the state.    I will be tuned in to see what happens, but then again this is the same guy who denied the legend Walter Payton a touchdown in Super Bowl XX to let the Fridge score one.  Always a fun coach to watch even if you didn't like everything he did.  Also if you are ever in Chicago try out  urlLink Mike Ditka's Chicago  for a great place to eat.  Dave and I ate there and it was wonderful, great atmosphere too.

      Growing up my favorite comic book hero was Superman.  Maybe it was the score by John Williams that always pumped me up, but Superman was the best.  I use to wear my Superman pajamas under my clothes, rip them off, and go save the world as a little boy.  So I was happy to hear that director McG is now out as the director of the new Superman movie.  I would love to see a new Superman movie, but could you imagine what this guy would do to it??  I just have this bad image of a cross between Superman and the silly action in the Charlie's Angels movies.  Enough to make me cringe at the thought.  So I don't know if the movie will ever be made, but no new movie is better than one directed by McG.

      Now that I have had a few days to sit back, relax, and think about my trip, I figured I would post an update about my trip.   First off I went to Kansas City to catch a Royals baseball game.  That was the 6th stadium I have made it to this summer.  Boring game, but they had a great fireworks show after.  I liked the old stadium, very different from what you see today, and the big crown in center field was fun to see after all these years of watching it on t.v. during a Rangers game.  The next day I was on my way to Mount Rushmore for their fireworks show on the 3rd.  I stopped in the town of  urlLink Deadwood  that has become a happening place thanks to the popular  urlLink show  on HBO.  Saw the chair where Wild Bill Hickok was supposed to be sitting in when he met his end, and did a little gambling.    urlLink Mount Rushmore  for the 3rd of July was spectacular.  I got to Mount Rushmore at 7:30 in the morning and was the first one to get through the gates.  I was told to go early and they weren't kidding.  By the time the fireworks went off at 9:30, there were 30,000 people there to take part in the greatest fireworks show I have ever seen.  After the show I spent two hours in my car waiting to get out, but it was well worth it.    On to Yellowstone.  Stopped by the  urlLink Crazy Horse Memorial  and made it in to Yellowstone.  I have now seen six large national parks in about six months and this is by far my favorite.  I didn't think anything could beat Yosemite, but the wildlife you see at Yellowstone is what won me over.  We weren't in the park ten minutes, and I saw a grizzly bear.    When in Yellowstone you get excited when you see a lot of cars pulled over because you know there is some type of wildlife ahead.  I saw everything you could dream of and even got some good pics which are posted below.  Never been that close to a buffalo before, and probably won't anytime soon.  Yellowstone has been compared to a theme park by some because what most people do is drive there car around and get out at all the popular sights.  I did a lot of this but was also able to take some long hikes into the backwoods to explore a little more.  After my Half Dome trip in Yosemite, these other ten mile hikes were nothing.  After two and a half days in Yellowstone I started to make the trip home with a brief stop at the Grand Tetons.  Like they said there, this is the name you get when you let a French trapper name the mountains.  It was a beautiful sight, and David informed me that is where they shot the Rocky IV training scene when he is climbing the mountain in Russia and screaming DRAGO!!!!    If somebody could only choose one national park to go to I would have to tell them to pick Yellowstone.  Yosemite would be 1a, but Yellowstone was the most beautiful place I have ever seen.    Traveling to national parks is a cheap way to spend a vacation and see some beautiful country.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation.  Spend a little time with nature and yourself.  You won't regret it.

      ESPN.com ran a  urlLink story  today about John Elway inviting his former coach Dan Reeves to his Hall of Fame induction ceremony in August.  Growing up a die hard Broncos fan this was great news to me.  The Elway-Reeves feud was well documented, and I hated to see how bad it had gotten between the two of them.    A lot has been made of the numbers Elway could have put up if it wasn't for Reeves coaching style.  I agree that Reeves coaching style held Elway back, but Reeves came from the Tom Landry school of coaching where you grind it out and throw very little.  Thinking back it's hard to believe neither of the above coaches changed their strategy much considering they had Elway and Staubach leading their teams.    Elway finally got his rings, and unfortunately Reeves never did.  I think Reeves was a hell of a coach who just couldn't win the big one.  Then again look at the teams he took to the Super Bowl.  Of the four teams he took to the big game, none of them really had any business being there, and it showed by the final score.  Dave and I had the opportunity to meet Coach Reeves in the summer of 2000.  We were guests at the Falcons training camp and that was something I will not forget soon.  Dave and I show up, and here comes Coach Reeves out of his office with a list of dumb blonde jokes he starts telling Dave and I.  Coach Reeves and his secretary Brenda took great care of us the whole trip.  Later I was able to attend two Falcons games and even get down on the sidelines before one game.  Coach Reeves might not be in any top ten lists for greatest coach ever but to me he is number one.  He played and coached with class, and he treated a goofy kid like me better than I could have ever dreamed of.  Not many coaches have 200 victories, so this should get Reeves into the Hall sometime in the near future.  And when this happens, I might have to make the trip to Canton to see my favorite coach growing up get the credit he deserves.

      Made it back from another whirlwind trip last night.  17 hours and four states later I was home.  I will post more details about the trip later, but again this was a trip that I should have taken a long time ago.  Mount Rushmore had 30,000 people on hand for their fireworks show and they didn't disappoint.  I got a few good pics and one is posted below.  Yellowstone was awesome.  There is so much to see, and the wildlife is everywhere.  I given got close to a baby grizzly cub.  Great stuff, and more details will follow.  Off to run errands now that I am back in the real world.

      I love Texas A&M.  I went to school there, drank a lot of beer there, and watched my Aggies take the field every chance I could.  I just finished reading an article in Sports Illustrated about the 77-0 defeat the Aggies took from OU last season.  The sense I got from reading this article, was poor Aggies, and poor Coach Franchione.  Give me a break, the Aggies were humiliated, and according to the article the coaches didn't want to "add to the players burden" at halftime even though they were getting beat 49-0.  You have got to be kidding me, I am a coach, and there are times to yell and scream, and times to be calm.  At the same time if you are a coach of a major college football program there is nothing wrong with ripping into your players when they are playing poorly.  These young men are getting a college education paid for, and they should know the expectations of going to a major program like A&M.    I wasn't able to watch any of the above mentioned game, but I was in Lubbock to watch the Aggies play Tech.  I had great seats, two rows behind the A&M bench.  The Aggies got killed that night, and I kept watching what Franchione would do and say to the kids.  The guy not once that I saw went up to a player after they came off the field and talked to them.  Didn't yell, scream, or motivate.  I was disgusted.  Granted, I don't know what was said at halftime, but if anything was said, it didn't work.  And he might have talked to players at times, but get pissed some, show some emotion.  It is one thing to get killed by OU, and God forgive me, even Texas last year, but not Tech!  You can not accept that type of beating from tech, even though Tech has become stronger over the last few years.  I am not a fan of Franchione.  The guy begs his players to stay at Alabama, and then takes off when offered another job.  No class, the longest he has stayed at one school is five years.  I know it was time for RC to go, but he was a class act.  I will be going back to College Station at the end of the season to see A&M play Tech again.  I wonder if the people in Kyle Field will still be loving Coach Fran if the Aggies go through another season like last year?

      Please excuse me for going off on a Seinfeld type rant, but an experience today was too much.  I went to get my haircut today at a Procuts.  Not a great place, but the only place around that isn't a twenty minute drive.  So for once I had no wait and was pretty excited, I was thinking in and out in fifteen minutes.  Not the case.  Why do people who cut hair feel like they have to make small talk?  Do people like to talk to strangers while they are getting their hair cut?  I don't, and especially when they ask a thousand questions.  And then even more personal questions.  Example:  Tammy: So where do you live?  Me: Over in Justin.  Tammy:  Oh me too! (Problem already)  Me:  That's nice  Tammy:  So where in Justin?  Me:  Behind the Justin Boot store. (Really the only true landmark in Justin)  Tammy: What street?  Now come on, do we have to get that specific?  Some fat, 40 year old lady who is married with four kids (according to her) asking what street I live on.  And the worst is when they stop cutting to talk, because they can't do two things at one time.  When I go get a haircut I don't mind a little small talk, even though I could do with none at all.  This lady though just kept on and on and on.  Don't talk, just give me my average haircut and let me go on my way.  I guess this was a better experience though than the last time when I went in.  There were four people ahead of me and two ladies cutting hair.  When one lady finally gets to me she decides to go on break when there are now six people behind me, leaving one lady to cut hair.  I hate getting my hair cut.  On a lighter note I am going to the Robert Earl Keen show tonight at Billy Bobs.  I was introduced to the greatness of Robert Earl my freshman year at Texas A&M.  I haven't seen him play in five years or so, I am looking forward to it.  The guy in my opinion doesn't have a bad album.  Pictures and a report on the show tomorrow.

      Yesterday I sat down and watched one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time get inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame today.  John Elway, Mr. Comeback, gave a great speech to a crowd that sounded like it was dominated by Bronco orange and blue.  I was happy to see that Elway gave thanks to his former coach Dan Reeves.  I thought that was a class act and it looked like Reeves was touched by the gesture.  Dave and I were able to see Elway play at Mile High Stadium in Denver during his final season.  It was the last game of the regular season and we had finally made it to Denver to see a game there.  I will never forget sitting in the hotel before the game reading the paper and thinking how close we were to seeing history.  Elway needed four TD passes to hit 300 for his career, and Terrell Davis needed 170 yards to break 2,000 for the season.  Dave said we would be lucky to see one of those things happen.  By the end of the game we had seen both, while sitting in the famous south stands.  So who is the greatest quarterback ever in the NFL?  You can argue for hours, but there is no doubt that the greatest I ever saw play was Elway.  Yes, better than Montana.  I hate people who bring his name up among the greatest of all time.  Montana was a great player who always produced in the big games.  Montana also benefited from being surrounded by studs.  Elway took three very average teams to those first three Super Bowls and it showed.  Once Elway was surrounded by talent like Montana, he finally was able to win two rings.    I won't put up a bunch of stats because first I don't feel like it, and second I am too lazy to do the research.  So if you have some stat to throw at me please do, and I will come back with one.  The ones that stick out though in favor of Elway are the following:  Most wins by a QB, 300 TD passes, 2nd in yards behind only Marino.  If you bring up Super Bowl wins, I'll give you that one, but if you go by that, Dan Marino wasn't that great of a QB.  I'll be very interested to hear what you guys have to say, but for my money give me Elway over them all.     .

      First off let me say there is no better feeling than getting out of a meeting four hours early.  It doesn't happen very often, so I plan to use the rest of my day to do nothing instead of working.  Speaking of nothing, it was finally  urlLink announced  that the Seinfeld DVD's will be available for purchase November 23rd, just in time for Festivus as the article puts it.  I was never a Seinfeld fan until Dave moved in, and then he set the TiVo to record all episodes.  Once I sat down and watched them I grew to appreciate the show more and more.  That will give me something to do over the Thanksgiving holiday.  Singer Rick James was found dead today in California.  No reports yet on how, but one can only guess what reports might come out over his death.  James life sounds like it has been one wild ride, I can't tell you much about his music besides the fact that I thought Super Freak was great back in the day.  I wonder if the Chappelle Show will end all of it's Rick James bits now.  I was getting real tired of hearing my 7th and 8th graders yelling "I'm Rick James Bitch!" anyway.  I need to go catch a movie this weekend.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Go buy an iPod.  This is the greatest gift ever, and I still haven't been able to play around with it too much.  It's nice to not have to listen to all the crap that is on the radio today.  Not many good stations k]left.

      I am really looking forward to tomorrow.  This has been a long week full of meetings, and I could use a break.  I realize I have been off for two months, but meetings are such a beating.  It's going to be tough to get back on a regular schedule, but I guess I am looking forward to going back to school.  Check back in a month and I will probably be singing a different tune.  My birthday was very quiet, which was nice.  Went to eat with some good friends, and had a great time.  Nothing beats good conversation.  Good conversation does not count talking about coffee grinders for thirty minutes though.  You know who you are.  But is was a great time none the less.  This weekend I will slowly start moving some things to the new house I will be living in soon.  I am looking forward to the move, I am sick of the drive out that way.  It will be nice to be near everybody, and Jason and I have decided we both now have someone to play video games with.  Childish, but fun.  Also my friends who are in Dallas will be much closer and maybe I will get to see more of them.   Later this weekend I hope to have some links up to different sites and to my pictures.  I have said this before, but I am going to get it done this weekend.  Looking back on all those pictures and places I've been this summer makes me realize how great I have it.  I was able to see a lot this summer thanks to being a teacher.  Like any job, it has it's perks.

      I turned 26 today.  I am now closer to 30 than I am to 20.  Very scary thought.  I am starting to feel old, especially when I go out to a bar and notice how young everyone is around me.    A couple of thoughts though on this birthday of mine.  -The DPS sucks.  I never got around to sending in the information to renew my license and was stuck up there for a while today.  I went to one in the Bedford area, and I had to take a number.  My number was 91.  The sign said number 34.  And it stayed on 34 for twenty minutes.  So I went to Denton and had a much shorter weight.  While in Denton I started to take some tests for my bus driving.  Took one and failed it by one question, all because I thought your mudflaps had to be ten inches from the road when it is suppose to be eight.  I had also changed five correct answers to wrong answers while waiting in line again.  Always go with your gut.  -Birthday gifts. I finally got an iPod and I have my best friend Dave to thank for that.  He did not buy me an iPod, he is taking the numerous gift certificates that my folks are giving me and putting them towards a washer and dryer for the new house.  Dave just made up the difference, and if my parents went too cheap I will be making up the rest.  The fact that Dave went out, found it, and went on and bought it is great.  Great gift, and I now know the greatness of the iPod.  You don't understand it until you own your own.  -Gift #2.  A friend of mine bought me a great old circa 1930 picture of a prohibition march in New York City.  It's one of those old brown and white looking photos, and she got it framed.  Great picture, I love it.  So that's it, I guess as you get older, the birthdays get less and less exciting.  Boy am I getting old.

      My summer comes to an end tomorrow as I have to get ready for another school year.  I start football meetings tomorrow at eight.  Yes I already had a week worth of football meetings, but I guess we need more.  Teachers report back Thursday full time, so that should be loads of fun.  Do you remember when we didn't start back to school until after September 1st?  Those were the days, nice long summer, and something about starting in the middle of August really bothers me.  I can't complain too much, I had a great few months off while most people only get a few weeks a year.  I was able to see a lot of the country and get ready for another long school year.  Oh a brighter note, Dave and I found a place to live in Bedford.  It's a little more than I wanted to pay, but it is three miles from my work, and a great old house.  We won't be in for another month, but I am already excited.    I'm off to study my playbook.
