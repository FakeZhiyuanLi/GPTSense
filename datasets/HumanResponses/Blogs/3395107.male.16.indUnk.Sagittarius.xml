      Went to CCM again. This time when I sang the worship songs I felt joy and happiness and praised Jesus from the depths of my heart.The sermon is about Joseph again in Genesis 37.Chemmy then prayed with me and others for two Aunts I do not wish to reveal at the moment.Then went to BlueSky to have dinner.That's all. Tomorrow have to go and do more research for HOI essay.

      Today is another ordinary mundane day. Woke up at 9 but fell asleep until about 9.55. Then I forced myself to wake up again. I changed and uttered a short prayer. Then I went to Evan Burge Building but I discovered that the HOI tutor Rex was seeing people one by one to comment on their HOI essays. I was a bit fuming. I should have slept until 10.45! Anyway I was quite ashamed of my essay. Slipshod at best. I promised myself to go and do more research on Saturday. Today for physics we plunged into momentum and impulse. Quite unexciting. Then for Maths 2 tutorial I asked Dr Felicity for assistance on the topic of ellipses and hyperbolae. Quite interesting topics. My sketches and work done on these conic sections would resemble a manuscript from the Principia Mathematica by Newton. That's all. Tomorrow had to go for Christian fellowship again. I can't wait!

      This is ridiculous! It is already 1.50 a.m. in Melbourne and I'm still online! Haha! Yesterday went to Physics Lab to do experiment with Kiran. On Oscilloscope.Quite boring. Tried out with AC and DC current. Woke up quite late and had to do research for HOI essay and rush to the lab. Unimpressive and I think the experiment was a big flop. :X  At IH dinner ate potatoes and lamb. Not quite appetising. Also had a dialogue with Aunt Teresa and Zhan Hui online. The weather is quite cold yesterday.My headache persisted again. Uncle Peter was quite concerned. That's all for today.Goodbye! :P

      Yesterday the Internet access was cut off. I desperately posted a message to the IHouse people.Today the access was restored. Praise the Lord! Yesterday I had much write about; went to two churches at once-SSCoC and CCM and partook in the communion TWICE.Quite a lot of singing, dancing and praising and worshipping and glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ.I was quite exhausted. I was quite happy to be among my people-united together as the Body of Christ.At CCM we also had to listen to a personal testimony, and it was quite shocking and emotional to see people crying as to how Christ has intervened in their lives. I also remembered that for the past 17 years I had suffered and endured all the ridiculous nonsense but finally God stepped in and pulled me out of this loneliness. Thank you Jesus, for redeeming me out of every tribe, tongue and nation with the blood You shed on the cross! No wonder His Word keep on ringing in my ears-"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." (John 16:33) After receiving the O Level results( which are quite rotten ), I was quite upset about the results. I cannot believe I was not even the top 20 ut I take comfort in the Word of God, "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God." ( 1 Corinthians 3:19 ) I then realised that getting lots of A1s do not matter with God; the O Level results slip is just a rotten paper worthy to be used as toilet paper!  Chemmy prayed for me and asked God to remove all the bitterness; I think that really helped a lot. Later we went to BlueSky restaurant and ate dinner with the group. For the first time, I realised how wonderful it is to have such friends around all united in the common belief of Jesus Christ. For the past 17 years, most of my close friends were Christians, who introduced me to other Christians. Hai Kiat-then Huifang, Benjamin and You Si. Then there's Jie Hui who introduced me to St James' and then James and others. Then I met Jojo and Neng by accident and I was introduced to CCM and about ten to fifteen other people. It is quite astonishing that God is guiding me into the hands of these people. I am quite thankful for what He has done. He has sustained me and was patient with me, and occasionally chastens me, but I am now very happy to have such a wonderful God whom I can call "Abba Father". In fact, the Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are the same God. It's quite astonishing that God's omniscience is due to His extradimensionality. Not even the secular laws of Evolution, Quantum Mechanics, Relativism, Agnosticism and Atheism can prevail against God-He will eventually put them under His feet. God is Great! Glory be to the High Priest of the order of Melchizedek! ( Hebrews 7:20-26 )

      Went to lecture for Maths 1 today. Nothing exciting. Today's lecture is about implicit differentiation and differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions. At Drama I did "space jump" and practised for the monologue exam, and I really did a nice job at pretending to be disturbed. Today is the birthday of the EAP teacher Pat; we celebrated it in FSC with a small ceremony with two chocolate fudge topped cakes. Then it is HOI lecture. As usual, it is about Christianity-this time it's about the comparison of Classical Humanism and Christianity.Not really impressed with Classical Humanism though. After HOI lecture I went back to IH to help in the "Suds Brigade" and do dishwashing. Had early dinner at 6 pm. Fish and chips. Then I served everyone chips. Later the church group called me; they wondered why I was absent from Bible study-I did not explain until later on. I finished washing at about 8.30 pm and now I am here, writing this blog! God bless me for another day and cure me of my terrible headache!

      Melbourne is such an unusual place compared to hot, humid Singapore. There is so much freedom that the cults like Jehovah Witnesses are quite widespread. Anyway, I went to Lygon Street yesterday to gorge on the Chicken Pizza and the Chocolatto ice cream. They are really quite fattening! It's winter now and the weather is very cold but the people are friendly. Too friendly. There's much to explore about this place. I feel like the Apostle John, exiled on the island of Patmos in the 1st century AD. Gotta go now! "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind"-Einstein

      Singapore...at last,after three months.Today went to Elim Church. Quite nice people there.Then they prayed for my headache. Later had lunch with Damai and Uncle.We then went to Thomson Plaza for shopping, whereas I went for a haircut.Tried SMSing Jie Hui but failed. Quite an ordinary day...except that the weather is very hot. I have to adjust once more after I return to Melbourne...haiz. Nonetheless, I'd better make use of my time here.

      Finally...the exams are over.Just took Maths 2 paper today.Had quite a shock at first as question types are entirely different from the previous papers-of course they would be, silly me!I was stuck at Question 7a on how to convert the parametric equations of the curve into Cartesian form.If I can remember they are x=2sec t and y=3tan t.It took quite a while before I finally solved the problem after squeezing some brain juice.Then there's Question 13.I was stuck but then I also managed to solve it.Finished the paper and left the hall at 11.30 a.m.-half an hour before the actual ending.However I forgot to bring back my Maths 2 lecture notes, so I rushed back at around 2-3 in the afternoon and thank goodness I found them at the reception-they had a box of "lost and found" Trinity College student items.Coincidentally, Haresh(whose mother forced him to return)also took the same flight although his ticket was booked very late-when supposedly all flights should be fully booked. That's all...tomorrow have to go and pack some more to prepare for the return to Singapore.

      Sigh..the exams are coming. My laptop's internet connection has gone haywire, I'm writing this post from the computer in school. Next Saturday, I will return to S'pore. Landing at 2150h.Finally, after so many weeks in the cold weather......I can't wait!

      Today the Maths 1 lecture finally completed the whole syllabus for Semester 1. Then I proceeded to Evan Burge for the monologue exam. I wondered how well I acted as a frustrated person.Then I went for EAP. Nearly caught sleepy by a threatening Pat. Then went for HOI lecture. The lecturer has returned from her trip in Europe. She's too enthusiastic about the Classical world. Lecture on Renaissance today. Then went to Chemmy's house for cell group. Had a short worship session, then prayer, then a discussion about mission. Then had dinner. Lamb, omelette, duck, rice, etc. Discussed with Chemmy and Kelvin about that mysterious dream of being a Tribulation saint. Also discussed with Kelvin about glossolalia.That's all for today.

      This diary entry is in the third person. Today Sean woke up quite late,about 12.45 p.m. He then ate a mearge breakfast of bread with nutella (a chocolate coating similar to butter). Then he went to the laboratory to conduct the Multislit Diffraction experiment with Kiran. It was a great success and the two managed to complete the experiment one hour before the laboratory session is supposed to end.In this experiment, laser and light from sodium and mercury were used. The laser was focused onto the wall with a diffraction grating placed in front of the source and the beam split to reveal five dots onto the wall. The distance between them was then counted to calculate the angle of diffraction and hence derive the wavelength of the light beam using the formula dsin@=m lamba, where lambda is the wavelength and m is the order of the lines from the normal. Then the experiment was conducted on sodium and mercury. It was quite a success. The two used a rotatable telescope to observe the line spectra of the lamps. Sodium produced only yellow lines. Mercury, on the other hand, produced yellow, green and purple lines. Sean was interested in this experiment as hidden behind it is the realm of quantum mechanics where the electron configuration and orbitals determined the actual colour of light observed in the spectrum.He then realised that different elements produced different line spectra of different colours, and deduced that the rotatable telescope can be used as a sort of crude spectrometer to determine the elements present in a substance. This method has been used by Fraunhofer and other physicists about two centuries ago to determine that the sun contains hydrogen and helium. Anyway later for dinner Sean had pork, potatoes and brocoli. He also had pumpkin soup and bread. He was so hungry he went for a second helping and gorged himself. Then later Sean filed up and sorted the notes and tutorials on his desk therefore freeing himself of all the mess. Here he is now, writing this blog.

      Today is a mundane, boring day.Had physics tutorial on Linear Momentum, which comprises of elastic and inelastic collisions. Then literature had a final discussion on Earth and Ashes by Atiq Rahimi. Then had a long talk with Haresh about eschatology. It's quite sad to see many people unaware of the signs of the times and end of the age.They have been blinded spiritually. Anyway after I returned home I rested, then ate dinner.Chicken with a bit of spices, rice and cream of lentil. Had bread dipped in lentil. Discussed with Jin Horng's sister about genetic manipulation and declining morality of today's society. Then went to talk to God back in room.I felt depressed-did I really make the right choice in coming to Trinity College? It seems that many people are enjoying themselves at VJC...but sigh, I guess it's my own fault. It is neither fun nor boring here-all neutral.Perhaps the Triune God has a reason for me to be here...I'm not sure. I hope Jesus comforts me with His words, since I feel quite lonely here.He might have a reason for me to be here, I await the revelation of His purpose for me...

      Went to SSCoC today. Had a sermon about the nature of the Godhead. There was discussion about the nature of the Heavenly Father. Many Christians have confused the members of the Triune Godhead and some thought it was the Father who died on the cross, not the Son. So this sermon cleared everything. After church, I had lunch in the church grounds then I went outside. There was this huge demonstration on saving Tasmania's forests. Thousands of people gathered at the State Library. It was quite a sight. There is a platypus float and ridiculous looking people dressed as trees. They all looked funny and I could'nt help laughing. Some were carrying placards and there was a podium where their leader (presumably) gave speeches. Then they marched downtown towards Flinders Street station. It was quite a strange sight. However at that time the Holy Spirit told me not to be like them. "Do not love the world or the things in the world. IF anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him"(1 John 2:15). Environmentalism is a false gospel and very New-Age oriented; it is naturalistic and the adherents worship the age old enemy of God-mother nature. Anyway later I took a nap until about 5 p.m. Had dinner of tofu and rice and cream of mushroom. Not so appetising. Then chatted with cousin Janet online about spiritual warfare.Quite a deep topic.Hopefully the Triune God hears my prayers and help me out.

      Today for HOI there's a discussion on scholasticism of the Middle Ages. Knowledge during that time was controlled by the Catholic Church. There was a talk on St Thomas Aquinas who used the works of Aristotle to defend the Christian faith. Anyway the idea of sainthood is flawed; in Heaven, all humans are equal in God's eyes and many Roman Catholic "saints" are not really that "nice" at all.It seems that the average Christian is far better than many Catholic "saints". Sainthood is not Biblical and all Christians are saints, not just a "selected nobility".  Then the discussion switched to the mysterious King John of England in the 13th century who signed the Magna Carta. Did not pay much attention to the details of the charter when I first read about him years ago. King John was supposedly the ruler who encountered Robin Hood. Anyway, the Magna Carta is very similar to the constitution we have today in Parliament, and Australia keeps a copy of it somewhere in one of the government offices or archives.Crude but basic. Then for Maths 2 I had lecture on the dot and cross product of 2D and 3D vectors. Quite ok.During dinner had chicken noodle soup and a "counterfeit" chicken rice with chicken drumsticks.Today I also faced spiritual oppression; persistent sadistic,evil thoughts about God and innocent people appeared in my mind repeatedly,including wicked, abominable,sexual thoughts.I felt quite trapped and prayed to Jesus to free me from this spiritual attacks, and He heard me. Everyday is the same problem...but I guess Joy was right-every Christian had to undergo spiritual warfare by countering lies from unseen invisible forces.It is very difficult to live a perfectly sanctified life, and Christians have to take the Kingdom of Heaven by storm. I hope Jesus will listen and set me free from this spiritual oppression, for I know His blood cleanses us of ALL sin, according to 1 John 1:7.

      Some developments here...for the past few weeks I have been lectured on topics the folks back in S'pore have already learnt for their A Levels Maths C. Type I and II substitution for integration, 1st and 2nd order differential equations,etc. For physics the lecture has turned from Kirchhoff's Laws to Electric Fields and Coulomb's Law, equipotentials and Gauss' Law. Gauss&nbsp;also invented Gaussian Elimination method for matrices. I can't understand why some, if not most, of the S'poreans&nbsp;back home have a presumptuous attitude towards education in&nbsp;Australia. They did not know that here in Trinity I'm learning&nbsp;some topics which are the same as what they are learning in their JCs. Sigh.If only they&nbsp;are more open-minded instead of&nbsp;subscribing to the assumption that Australian education is "slack".  These aside, I also joined the Chess Club and&nbsp;in the middle of a game with Haresh I simply left without notice,haha...I&nbsp;apologise for that, Haresh.&nbsp;One of the HOI essay questions is about Martin Luther and the Reformation. Without Luther&nbsp;we will still be trapped in&nbsp;Catholic dogmas&nbsp;that are founded solely on&nbsp;man-made traditions. However honestly I'm starting to&nbsp;feel a bit "burned-out"&nbsp;in Christianity...I need to rekindle the smouldering wick of my&nbsp;"oil-lamp". I&nbsp;felt a bit disgruntled but there is something within me that still urged me to&nbsp;hold&nbsp;on.&nbsp;

      It's precisely one day and one week since I returned.The weather is "mercilessly cold". These eight days are full of ups and downs.The sinusitis returned with a vengeance. Somehow I performed quite dismally for physics,something which Einstein will definitely not condone for a prospective physicist.Actually not really "dismal" but should have done better.I screwed up for the ladder question and could not derive the coefficient of friction.Maybe I should start filling the engine in me with oil in order to rekindle my interest in physics.Physics aside,I was quite dismayed by the results for Maths 2-74%-which I felt I could have done better. I need to pull up my socks for these two subjects as well as for Maths 1 where I could have easily scored 90+ but due to insufficient preparation, I overlooked composite functions and did not really perform up to standard.Functions killed me again,as they had done in Upper Sec.The only positive results came from HOI and English Literature. The marker of my Literature Essay commented I wrote "a strong essay".I had poured out my deep thoughts and insights into the topic of physical and emotional sanctuaries of characters in the short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri and Atiq Rahimi. Hmm...perhaps if I can tune this deep analysis to my "now dried" interest for physics then I could produce unexpected results,who knows?  My Christian life is as normal with some evangelism still going on in RMIT and the world.Met up with the CCM members,etc. Literature began on a new novel-Frankenstein.After reading I realised that the monster is not named "Frankenstein" but rather,its creator. This is a popular misconception by many people.There are many things of which I would like to write down, by my mind needs a rest.Adieu.

      Last Sunday I went to St James' Church.However it seemed that Jie Hui was rather caught up with a lot of work, so she was unable to watch the movie with me.She had to prepare for a church play,and also had to juggle her workload at VJC.It seems that VJC will stop at nothing to press its students to give it all the glory.How sad life is...nowadays S'pore is producing only "hard disk drives".It is apparent that A1s are like the life support systems for most of the friends I know.Goodness.If only they realised that Jesus Christ is the answer to all their needs instead of result slips that can perish.I just realised that without Jesus,I'm like a robot without the batteries plugged in.Of course,in Australia the situation is'nt so bad.It is far better to seek the Kingdom of Heaven first than all these results which will not get you anywhere. Prestige, power, glory,wealth, etc will all be destroyed ultimately.Every knee will bow to Jesus, and He will get all the glory.It's all the fault of this evil system of globalism. For the sake of getting a top notch economy, Singapore and countries like Japan are pressing their students to excel.It is clear the god of this world, Satan, is behind all this nonsense in order to take people's minds off Jesus. He has done it successfully even among Christians. Anyway,yesterday met Ben Choong and Daryl Soh for lunch.Chatted with them,and introduced the two to each other-they are in the same JC. they portrayed NYJC as being less stressful compared to VJC.After that watched Spiderman 2.Quite unimpressed...Doc Ock was quite a pathetic villain, a good guy under the control of his own machine. He does not seem formidable, and the physics in the show is rather fictitious and ridiculous. How can a mini sun attract all the metals, and yet sink into water without smoke?Heehee...:P Doc Ock had an interesting saying, "Intelligence is a privilege to be used for the benefit of humanity".I fully agree with him at this point.

      Lecture on Gauss' Law today for electric fields.Quite interesting except for the technical details. Then did tutorial on Trapezoidal Rule.Had Dinner today and the guest-of-honour was the First Lady of Timor-Leste, the wife of Xanana Gusmao, President of Timor Leste.She was a graduate from the University of Melbourne and author of a book.She gave a speech about her adopted country and highlighted the problems there,which pertain to health, poverty and some maritime issue regarding the seas around Timor Leste.It was a formal dinner today but I did not know that I was supposed to dress formally.Luckily nobody noticed.They served turkey and potatoes and some overcooked vegetables plus soup (which I think was minestrone). They also served garlic bread.It was a formal occasion lasting about 2 hours.However during the dinner my headache persisted.I suspect it is due to a blood pressure build-up behind my left eyeball-papilledema. Quite frustrating...
