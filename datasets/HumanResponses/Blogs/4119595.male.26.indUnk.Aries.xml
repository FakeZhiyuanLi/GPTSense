      The other day, I linked to a site entitled " urlLink Assassinations Foretold in Moby Dick ," which told of various assassinations, including Sirhan Sirhan's, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, and Kennedy's, which were foretold in that epic whaling tome,  Moby Dick . For those of you who are interested, the authors of this site are not psychopaths, but are using  Moby Dick  to disprove the concept of  urlLink Bible Codes .  Anyway, I spent most of the day today reading that Web site, and found it all very interesting. What was most fascinating to me—although maybe a bit obvious, now that I write it— was the way that the Bible Code believers, when confronted with evidence that  Moby Dick  contains the same kind of "code" as the Bible/Torah, they simply said that the code in  Moby Dick  was false. I didn't think they would just shrug their shoulders and say, "What do you know? I guess I was wrong," but I would have at least liked it if they bowed down and started reading  Moby Dick  as a new testament of God. It would be a fabulous religion. Instead of people saying that they saw demons dogging them until God's mercy saved them, they would say they hunted white whales until they were saved. The initiates would be called Ishmael until they were fully part of the faith. It would be great.  Anyway, for more on Bible Codes, including links to people who believe they are real, and a thorough explanation of why they are not, here is a link to the  urlLink main site  of the  Moby Dick  page. And for a more interesting view of hidden codes from God than any actual believer has presented, read " urlLink The Gimatria of Pi " on  urlLink The Fortean Bureau .  I'd like to note just briefly that, while generally skeptical, I'm not a complete skeptic. I believe in things like ghosts and whatnot, and there is an alley up the road from where I live that I'm convinced makes people insane, because I've never seen anyone in it who wasn't. But I choose to believe these things because they make my life richer, and they make the world more interesting to live in. And maybe some of this same phenomenon is at the root of this Bible Codes business, but I personally find that using pseudoscience to justify one's faith just makes that faith incredibly shallow. Faith is illogical, unprovable, and in the eyes of anyone who doesn't have it, usually seems ridiculous, if not flat-out wrong. And that's fine. To dillute it with distorted mathematics and faulty science just cheapens both: the faith and the science.  Right. To bed with me. Hard day at work tomorrow, followed by two weeks of abject goofing-off.

      The bylaws committee for  urlLink Tantalus  met last night and got some fantastic work done. We managed to rough out, in only a very few hours, the structure of our bylaws. Which I think is pretty impressive. We'll have a more complete version in a week or two. I was elected to write the preamble for the bylaws, because we thought we should have one, and because I'm the writer-type guy in the committee. Last year I wrote a disclaimer for  Dreadful Penny...  that included a preamble, but I don't think that'll work this time. The IRS has a notoriously poor sense of humor where things like demonic possession are concerned.  In two days, I'm going on vacation. Friday night, after work, I hop a plane to Philadelphia for a week and a half of hanging out at the beach, writing, and most importantly, seeing my family for the first time in months. This will be the first time in my life that I have a paid vacation.  I mean to spend a great deal of time in my favorite coffee shop, the Last Drop. The Last Drop is a great, out of the way little coffee shop, which is well lit and quiet with a good cup of coffee. And most importantly, the other clientele are often perfectly willing to get into a conversation with me, a complete stranger, on the merits of my being from Philadelphia.  I'm also excited about visiting the  urlLink Mutter Museum , which is the museum of medical oddities. Really, once you've seen one hydrocephalic fetus, you've seen you've seen them all, but sometimes they have a good exhibit. Even if they don't, it's well worth it to see the skeleton of the world's tallest man stand next to the skeleton of the world's smallest woman.  And  urlLink the woman who turned to soap  is always worth a look.  Hmmm...there's times I think I should have been a doctor.  A mad doctor, naturally.  I bought two books for my trip, Brooks Hansen's  The Chess Garden , which I found out about on  urlLink Jeff Vandermeer's  blog, and  The Encyclopedia of the Dead , by Danilo Kis, which I found out about on  urlLink The Modern Word . I'm especially excited about  The Encyclopedia of the Dead . Short stories in the Borgesian vain: I can't wait. Nothing says relaxation on the beach like complex explorations of metaphysics. Um...or maybe I'll start with the other one.   as an aside...  I've been kind of anxious lately, loosing sleep. Someone who I haven't seen in a while is coming back soon and I'm worried about that, because the last time I saw her, things got bad for a while. I went a little nuts and lost control. I'm afraid of her return and I don't know entirely why. Because I don't know where I stand with her—what is she thinking about me, will we be friends, will we start arguing again, was I missed, etc. It's all so uncertain, which the future always is, but with her, somehow, it's different. She has power, because I care so deeply what she thinks, and because I don't know what that is. She and I stand at a place where our could go anywhere: toward something really special or just towards apathy. She means so much to me that I'm terrified of it moving toward apathy.  I'm just afraid right now, plain and simple. I'm afraid because the future is so vast and I care so much that it has a specific outcome. I'm afraid to move because I don't know which move to make. Which is why I'm walking. Looking for the Buddha in me so that I can move and know it is the right move, because there isn't any right move. It is as my roommate always says, "It is what it is." And that's all it is. The path is long and winding and it doesn't always end in the same place it seemed like it would.  So my first step toward that is writing my fears out here, in the hopes that, maybe she'll see this and understand that, if I seem a little weird the first time I run into her, it comes from here and not from anger or bitterness or anything of that sort. And I'm writing it here in the hopes that, by saying the name of my fear out loud, in public for everyone who reads this to see, I can gain power over it. Fears are cowards; they don't like to be exposed. This one is, especially. I'm anxious over nothing, because it hasn't happened yet.

      My friend, Elizabeth, who I really don't deserve as a friend for many reasons, was kind enough to point out, when I first started this blog, that there are not, in fact, any whales here.  This is for her.   urlLink http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/cetacea/cetacean.html   urlLink http://www.whales-online.net/eng/FSC.html?sct=1&amp;pag=1-3-1.html   urlLink http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/moby.html   And now, there be whales here.  Yarrr...

       a quick addition     Just a link I found:  urlLink F The Vote   I think the text on the opening page really says it all:   SEXY LIBERALS OF THE U.S. UNITE in taking back the government from the sexually repressed, right-wing, zealots in control! Everyone knows liberals are hotter than conservatives - we look hotter, we dress hotter, our ideas are hotter, and we are infinitely hotter in the sack. We must use our sexual appeal to our advantage, as one more weapon in our already diverse arsenal. By stripping conservatives out of their clothes, we can also strip them of their power.   Hey, if it helps get Bush out of power, I'm all for it.  Be warned, the site makes no guarantees that there isn't nudity or some other racy material on it, and consequently, neither do I.

      God, the fall weather of the past couple of days has been perfect; the air has been cool and sweet-smelling, the streets just a little damp from the sporadic rains, and at night there's a little bite to everything, just enough to make me feel solid again, just enough to grant a little redemption. From what? I'm not sure, but I think everyone could use a little. Weather like this leaves me nostalgic. It's the smells, the charcoal scent of leaves burning that just seems to churn up in weather like this, even though there haven't really been any leaves to burn just yet. But the atmosphere keeps a few particles of the smell in reserve, just for people like me. Just for the good memories it brings.  I walked four and a half miles from my office up to Wrigley Field in this weather. Ignored the clouds that kept threatening to make it rain, even when they briefly made good on that threat. Bring it on, I figured. A little fall rain in the late summer never hurt anyone, least of all me. And when my gimp foot told me that it was time for it to stop pounding the pavement, I took a train up north to Roger's Park and sat down for a cup of coffee in Cafe Ennui (a more affected name, I've never heard). I sat there, reading, and flirting at great distance with a pretty girl in a long coat, and revising a short story, but mostly it was memories. Roger's Park is the first neighborhood I lived in when I moved to Chicago. I had lived a summer in Evanston, subletting from my friend Dan, and when the summer was over and he needed to move back in, I answered an ad for a roommate needed. The woman I moved in with was an eccentric named Jenny Marx (not Karl's daughter, but she would joke that she was) with two cats, named Rama and Seta, both Siamese.  The months I spent in that apartment were some of the most interesting and productive I think I've ever experienced. Because I was essentially still a traveler in Chicago, so everywhere I went there was a new experience waiting for me, a new alley to explore, and new people to meet. Any stranger I met on a bus, or in a coffee shop, I would talk to them and for a time, I would have a new friend. And as I sat in Ennui, and the coffee warmed my bones the way soup does on chilly rainy nights, I just remembered all of the great experiences I had when I first got here. I remembered spending hours sitting with my friend, John Deng, one of the  urlLink Lost Boys of the Sudan , listening to him talk about his childhood as a refugee among other child refugees; I remembered learning some of his language, Dinka, from him. I thought of the way Rama took to me like I was his personal mirror; how whenever he was around me, he expected that I look at him, and if I weren’t, the way he would meow until I did. It wasn't enough for me to idly pet Rama—I had to look at him while I did it. Mostly, I remembered the countless hours of exploring the streets of my new city and the feeling that anything was possible, that life was still undetermined and that anything I could conceive, I could do. It was perfect freedom, and tonight I needed a dose of that.  By way of reward for what I found, I ran into my friend Steve, who I met running a show this summer. Steve is another writer, and he is also one of the greatest people I know right now. I say this, partially because I know Steve will eventually read this post, but also because Steve reminds me a lot of that freedom and the feeling that life, in whatever form it may presently exist, is always still open and still open to play.  So the universe has left me with some happy synchronicity tonight, which makes me smile. I think I'll go out on the back porch and take in some of that smoke-air. Then to bed and to dreams.

      I was very excited today. My brother showed me some concept sketches for the front page of my Web site. Initially, since so much of my writing deals somewhat with anatomy and medicine—they are of a theme—I was hoping to use something like a picture out of an old anatomy book. This was quickly toned down, on the grounds that most people who aren't me find anatomical drawings creepy, and my writings on the subject are absurd, rather than scary. So I decided to go with a phrenology chart, and my brother—being brilliant as he is—took that one step further and came up with the idea of a phrenology chart for a sperm whale. He sent me a rough concept sketch today and I loved it. Fantastic, my brother is. I should add that he came up with this idea and executed it, all in a matter of hours.  Sunday I went to a potluck at my friends Mark and Adrienne's apartment. The theme for the party was "soul food," which immediately made me want to make collard greens, which immediately after made me realize I have absolutely no idea how to make collard greens. So I settled for making strawberry shortcake. I had absolutely no idea how to make an actual strawberry shortcake, mind you, but I had a reasonably good idea for how to improvise one. I started out by making a biscuit dough and adding about a cup and a half of sugar, instead of the teaspoon of salt that the recipe called for: my logic, of course, was that biscuits are really just a kind of shortbread and that, with enough sugar added, shortbread would become shortcake. It was flawless logic, except when I added the milk to the flour, rather than getting a nice sticky mass of gluten and butter chunks, I got a wet soupy glop. So I kneaded in a few more handfuls of flour until I had a sticky ball of something that was not exactly biscuit dough, but not cake batter, either.  When I was done with that I went to whip the cream for the filling, and since I don't have a mixer, and I didn't want to spend a half hour whisking at high speed, I decided to do it in the blender. This worked fine for the half-pint of heavy whipping cream that I bought, but it didn't whip enough air into the mix to cover the strawberries. So I bought another pint of lighter whipping cream, and started on that. After a few minutes, I heard a nice thunk from the blades of the blender, followed by another, followed by the appearance of ugly clots floating in the milk. "My God," I thought, "what on earth is that? That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen." So naturally, I tasted it. Butter. I had churned butter in my blender. It was like that parable with the two frogs in the milk, only substituting a blender for the frogs.  In the end, I went out and bought some RediWhip and the cake turned out fantastic. The bread portion, while not as biscuity or flaky as I had hoped, wasn't too dense either. It had something like the consistency of a scone. And the potluck was fantastic fun. A good mix of people, food, and wine.  The e-bay fiasco resolved itself yesterday. Well, it wasn't really resolved, so much as the Universe called a reset. I found the money order in my mailbox, marked Return to Sender. The guy selling the computer decided to relist it on e-bay, and under the advice of my roommate, I decided not to bid again. So I cashed the money order and deposited back into my savings today, and that leaves everything more or less back where it was when I started. Which is a good thing, I suppose. I kept wondering what I would do with two laptops.   Some links   I found  urlLink A Softer World  on Neil Gaiman's site a while ago and spent an hour or so addicted to their archives. Some of the cartoons are just sublime. They make me think that whoever makes this cartoon would be the kind of person to think they are better than me. I'm not entirely sure they'd be wrong.  I like the children's art exhibit at  urlLink Dream Anatomy . Not to play favorites, or anything, but I especially liked  urlLink Jacqueline Kantor's  and  urlLink Jenna Kantor's  pictures. Jacqueline's reminds me of  urlLink Alex Grey , whose paintings inspire a lot of my writing. Jenna's looks like a Basquiat painting; I'm not sure if that says a lot about Jenna's talent, or if it says a lot about Basquiat. Either way, I liked her drawing.  And if anyone is reading this who lives in Evanston or nearby, Tantalus is performing "Sinister Puppetmen of the Fabrication Gallery" at the Evanston Lakefill at 2:00 and 4:30 p.m. on this coming Saturday. If you can be there, please go. It's a fantastic show, and deserves to be seen.

      Late night, last night. I went to a party at my friend's house on the South Side—the very far south side of Chicago, so far that if I traveled any farther I wouldn't have the right to say I was in Chicago anymore. That south side. The party was fun: bonfire and a lot of wonderful new people who I can't wait to see again. I stayed up until about six in the morning talking with my friend Cat about all the things that have been bubbling around in my head for the past couple of months. It was cathartic, but at the same time it just left me with more questions to percolate.  I finished my rewrites on "Daedalus, In His Mirror, Icarus" on Friday, after a mad marathon push of typing, pacing, thinking. And when I flicked on the television (to distract my jumbled thoughts so that I could focus on the writing) I discovered that there was a  urlLink Farscape  marathon on. So naturally, I was overjoyed. I put "Daedalus" into manuscript format yesterday and will be sending it out to  Asimov's  today sometime.  Last week, I bought a computer on e-bay—a used laptop, not state-of-the-art, of course, but it was fast enough for my writing purposes and it also featured a DVD drive. Which was very exciting. The person from whom I was buying wanted a money order or a cashier's check mailed to him, so I went out and promptly got the necessary cashier's check for $270 and mailed it out to him the next day in San Francisco. He still hasn't gotten it and is beginning to get antsy. So now I don't know what's happening: am I out $270? Did someone else get the money, or is it just lost in the mail? Can I cancel a cashier's check and have one reissued? Am I completely fucked? The whole thing just has me annoyed in a huge way. What's worse, my poor roommate, whose e-bay account I used to buy the computer, has to be the bearer of bad news and therefore has to deal with me being annoyed. Sorry, Ian. Anyway, here's hoping it all works out and I can go home with a new computer in tow.  And in one final note, happy birthday to my brother Mike. He turned 29, I think, on Friday. Happy birthday, Mike.

      I took three days off of work so that I could finish the second draft of a story, start the second draft of another, and maybe pick up the thread of my novel, which the general distractions of life and a bruised heart made me drop a few months back.  Instead, I spent most of yesterday and today procrastinating and being all around generally lazy. Of course, the day is young still, so it isn't all lost. And I have tomorrow and the weekend, but I still feel like a complete ass, having wasted yesterday and still sitting inside today, staring at my monitor. Somewhere out there, a muse is shaking her head woefully and rolling her eyes at the thought of me. Or else she's packing her things and going on a road trip to find someone more worthy of inspiration.   We all knew Brittany was up to something...  Among things I've found while wasting time today was  urlLink Stairway to Heaven Backwards , which features exactly what it promises, and more: a backwards version of "Stairway to Heaven," as well as several other pop songs, exposing their hidden lyrics. The hidden lyrics to "Stairway" are actually kind of sweet and soulful. I mean, they're about Satan, yeah, but they're still really lovely--they show a side of the Dark Lord that you don't often see in Satanic lyrics.  Brittany Spears' secret lyrics are somehow not at all a surprise, but they're interesting nonetheless.

      You know, I've had this blog for probably a year or so and haven't added anything to it, simply because I keep thinking that I should start out by introducing myself to everyone, and then I freeze. If there's one thing I'm lousy at, it's talking about myself. But, you have to do it eventually.  So. About me: By day, I'm an editor. I work for the University of Illinois at Chicago's Office of Publications. By night, and by life, I'm a writer of surrealist short stories and poetry, as well as the occasional odd play. My work is largely unpublished; in fact, with the exception of but a single poem, " urlLink Face Mongers ," published on the  urlLink Mudlark  online journal of poetry, my work is entirely unpublished. Which means I keep a day job for now.  Recently a few friends of mine and I started a theatre company in Chicago, called the Tantalus Theatre Group. We're an experimental theatre company, specializing in new works and new interpretations of old works. Our mission is to use exploration and play to create a theatrical experience that is moving, profound, and magical, both for the audience and for ourselves. Although we've already produced several shows over the years, our first show as an official company has just opened. It's entitled "The Sinister Puppet Men of the Fabrication Gallery," and it will be seen in parks all around Chicago for the remainder of August. Check out our Web site,  urlLink http://www.tantalustheatre.org/ , for information about where to see it.  And that's me, nutshell style. -Matt

      I found this sitting in my inbox when I checked my e-mail just now.  It's lovely:  I have attempted to "Login" to the order site and am not able to. I attempted to create a password but it will not accept it. I used 8 characters with several numbers and 1 capital but it didn't accept it. I asked for my password to be sent to me, but an hour later it wasn't sent. What do I have to do?  Never before have I seen a statement about the frustrations of online ordering systems, so elegant that it borders on transforming into a Zen koan.  But here it is.  "What do I have to do?"  Indeed.
