      How many more days can I sit at this desk and stare at the computer before I go mad?  The last girl to have this position lasted about a year and 8 months before she admitted that the cancer she was dying from was only made up so as to give her more free time away from this desk. She was in fact healthy as a horse and enjoyed weeks of paid sick leave while she endured her imaginary Chemo. I've been here the year and 1/2 since she was she was fired.  Faking cancer in all likelihood will lead to actual cancer, so rather then employ her through her envidable real battle with the illness down the road, she had to be canned immediately. So here I am now waiting to go crazy, just like my predecessor.

      Well well well, if it isn't Monday! Hilary and I spent the weekend absorbing too much alcohol which has left me listless all irritable. The only thing worse then being those things is writing a cranky blog. So I won't. What's worse then logging on to the world wide web and complaining?  Friday afternoon Hilary I spent in athletic lounge clothes sitting in the tv den of laziness. The only thing motivating us to adjurn to the table, was a dime bag with the crumbs of some weed Hilary found at gas station last month. We had stopped at a Mobile Mart on a road trip up to Worchester (7 Mash Shows). So Hilary is walking along, minding her own business when she stumbles upon this delicious little treat. What I liked 2nd most about when she found the weed, was how she only saw it because she was walking across the lot with her head down, eyes on pavement. She told us how she always finds herself walking like this, and as a result, finds many treasures. Kitty noted that indeed it is the meek who will inherit the earth.  So anyhow, Hillary and I get good and giggly from the pot, and then proceed to mix up some cocktails, with shakers and martini glasses- the whole bit! This was only killing time until the Champagne we lazily ordered from the liquor shop across the street cooled off, as I had not had the frame of mind to order it cold! Stupid Tracy. So a few bowls, a couple cosmos and a bottle of champagne later we had killed the two hours we were waiting to meet with our evening plans.  I'm too lazy to tell the story of the rest of the evening.

      I"m weighed down today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything is a big mess.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure lots of people at work are paralyzed,&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;lots of people out of work.&nbsp; It's Tuesday, perhaps the most awkward of weekdays.&nbsp;

       NJMattyG:  ha, we used to have this dog named Blanche, Stories of her are everywhere, but this one involves a pool. we used to have this little solar cover thing we'd put on the pool so as to keep it warm.. it was like the ghetto-style pool heater.. NJ, representin so one morning Blanche, who enjoyed a good swim like any good dog, went up on the deck and jumped in the pool with the cover on Blanche, mind you, is this little angry cockerspaniel that bites anyone whos face gets too close, my own included So our neighbor Tony hears splashing around and figures we're going for a morning swim.. He comes outside only to see Blanche in such peril! somehow he managed to get the dog out of the pool without getting wet or getting bit.. From then on, he was always known as Super Tony, plus his wife Paula was so hot   tracykraft46:  it could have turned out terribly   NJMattyG:  Hmm.. I think.. yes, I do have a tale of blanches viciousness in the pool   tracykraft46:  one time I spent an entire day searching for the cutest dachshund puppy we looked high and low and then we were all standing around talking about where else to check and someone was looking at the pool cover- everyone got really quiet- and terribly slowly someone went over and rolled it back only to reveal the poor little brown puppy on the pool floor: dead!   NJMattyG:  That's a horrible story   tracykraft46:  so blanche really lucked out thank goodness for Tony   tracykraft46:  yeah- I know. you okay? it was a harsh story- but you needed to hear it in order to appropriately count your blessings   NJMattyG:  I know It brought me back down.&nbsp;I want to tell you of Blanche's viciousness so have I painted the accurate picture of my former dog? a small cockerspaniel that's cute as can be until you got close to her, and then she'd attack without thinking of the consequences. One time we were all in the pool and Blanche would hang out on the deck, put her two cute little paws on the stop rung of the ladder, and try to will herself to jump&nbsp;in &nbsp;so we're all swimming around in the pool with Blanche watching over us And Anna, who always thought Blanche was cute and wanted to further her relationship, decides to go speak to her. So Anna is in the pool and swims over to the ladder where Blanche is waiting. Anna is face height (as she is in the pool) with the dog. Blanche sees her coming and wags her whole butt you see, for whatever reason they crop Cockerspaniel's tails, so all she had was a little nub. So when she got excited, she would wag her entire ass- so Anna swims over, Blanche is shaking her ass in excitement. It looked like a scene out of a kids story she got up to Blanche and started petting her.. all was looking good-birds were chirping, a slight breeze blowing&nbsp; and then Anna decides that her love for Blanche could not be complete without a hug- so she hugs my dog. &nbsp;Blanche's ass stops wagging the hug went off without a hitch. But then when Anna tried to pull away, Blanche attacked this story&nbsp;is funny to recount, even though Anna got hurt and it was bad at the time. So Blanche bites Anna right ni the face. She must have gotten off a few bites before Anna got away. Good old Blanche   tracykraft46:  really chewed on her face eh?&nbsp;  &nbsp; NJMattyG:  awkward situations rule Like those tense few seconds when Anna was bleeding into my pool.... from HER FACE  &nbsp;I must say despite all of her viciousness, we loved Blanche. Unfortunately, &nbsp;she passed a few years ago after living a long life. We used to give her treats because she was the cutest dog in the whole house...what Blanche didn't know was that she was also the only dog in the whole house   tracykraft46:  stupid blanche!

      Last night I spent watching television and eating leftovers on the couch.&nbsp; It was very comfortable.&nbsp; I wound up&nbsp;investing&nbsp;somewhere over an hours time in "Yentl",&nbsp;concurrently&nbsp;getting in touch with my Jew roots.&nbsp; Yentl is a charming yarn in which Barbra Streisand proves that with short hair and the right getup- there is no difference between her and a young Jew male who is&nbsp;coming of age while&nbsp;studying the Torah.&nbsp;&nbsp; She fools everyone- including yours&nbsp;truly.&nbsp; It wasn't like the 80's rendition: Just One of the Guys, in which the lead is played by an actress so pretty there is no possibility&nbsp;that she could realistically&nbsp;pull one over on anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yentil really looks like a young Jewish man,&nbsp; even when she comes clean as a woman- she&nbsp; really still looks like a boy, a&nbsp;boy with&nbsp;the&nbsp;killer vocals&nbsp;of a&nbsp;Jewish lady&nbsp;from Brooklyn that is.&nbsp; Barbra does indeed have talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching&nbsp;Yentl,&nbsp;eating leftover ravoli- all in all a great night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I just attended a funeral for a great man.  He was my father's friend and my friend's father. Knowing how hard his death was on everyone made me incredibly sad.  His leaving was an enormous loss.  Hearing everyone reflect about how this man led his life, makes me want to do more, and be better.   One friend of his who was speaking remembered to us that this great man would not tolerate ill words being spoken of others.  If present, he would interupt by simply saying "too much information".  I remember him saying this to his daughter and me when we were caddy 5th grade girls.  He'd say it serval times to us, until we changed our subject. It wasn't until today that I recognized the genuis in this.

      This past weekend my gang and I went to our nations capitol.  I should note here that I often misuse "I"- for example- I'm known to say "One bottle should be plenty for Katie and I." That's wrong on several fronts, but what's relevant here is this:  I made said error this past weekend, and Katie corrected my grammatical error. I speculated, much to Eileen's joy, that it is a habit born from my desire to sound fancy.  Anyway- I recognized that I'm no better then those who attempt to sophisticate their vocabulary with filthy trash like irregardless and now I'm ashamed.  Another shameful thing happened this weekend, and this one Katie was sure to drive home the next day. The sad part is, on Sunday morning while I lay with my battle wound from my dancing accident elevated, and a coke washing away my gentle hangover. I drastically reduced the 'price' I had to pay for my Saturday, by sticking Strictly to beer and cigarettes, I felt a contentment- not common the morning after a 12 hour drinking binge. So there I am happily revisiting the outsiders, discussing how I was glad we made it back to Eileens apartment and where we would have all had to sleep when Katie pipes up and reminds us that a very kind quiet boy from school had offered to accommodate all 5 of us in a completely nonscummy way, rather then have us make the drive back to Georgetown. Anyway- the story goes that after sweetly offering us our own rooms at his parents house down the way, and being sure that he knew we were welcome- I couldn't muster a thank you, or even acknowledge his kind offer- I only responded "do you have a Pool?"  He didn't, and so terribly those were my last words on the matter. The real reason I started this story of our adventure in DC is to address the subject of my newfangled limp....but that will have to wait, as now i've grown weary and must take refuge in a delicious cheddar and mozzarella grilled cheese.

      While I can't wear my denim to work, I can surely type about it. I love so many things about denim. One important thing is how giggly my girl Eileen gets when I show up to see her after months apart, adorned head to toe in denim. She likes to pretend I'm her Canadian Pen Pal andor her GermanTourist friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to pretend I'm a soldier in the denim army and I never travel without my uniform.&nbsp; We both agree that referring to this suit of denim as my 'tux', really works the best for everyone.&nbsp; I have more to say about denim, but for now, this will do.&nbsp; I'll leave you with this challenge: I dare you to think of a material better suited for all around action then good old American denim!

      I was walking out of the laundry matt on Hudson yesterday when a white man in his 50's passed by me- dressed head to toe in robes. He had somesort of headdress fashioned out of a small sheet, held down with a headband of rope. He had spectacles on and was carring some literature and a boom box in his arms.  He didn't seem to be on a religious crusade, more just starved for attention and looking for some notice. He was probably the annoying cousin of that fellow who nabbed Elizabeth smart last year.  Anyway, I leave the laundry matt, and we pass on another, I've seen him around before so I pay him no notice.  Then I turn back as I forgot to add my dryer sheets, and we cross paths again. He is sure I've come for a second look and shrugs his shoulders raising his palms to the sky and proclaims "It is what it is!"  No shit. That doesn't even mean anything. If you're gonna get all gussied up and put on a song and dance- at least have a meaningful message for me.

      My sista friend Hilary grew with Mash shows as her measure of time.  For example, a road trip from her hometown the 3&1/2 hours south to Manhattan would have been 7 Mash shows.  Her father Neal still responds to her queries of distance and time in these Mash Show terms, and I love this. So here I am at my desk with roughly 12 Mash shows to go until what I hope will be an early(3pm) dismissal. Waking up this morning was filthy.  I negotiated with myself that I could sleep until 10minutes before departure time, but this was only after several bouts of resetting my alarm. Also I have no alarm clock, so I've been using my cellphone to wake up for over a year which is completely awful.   I pretended in my drunken haze at 2am last evening that I'd be willing to get up at 7:20am but instead I kept resetting the damn phone in 5 minute increments.  I felt heavy and thick and I wondered how many minutes were too few to go back to sleep for.  I found myself fully awake rationalizing going 'back' for 2 minutes, it was filthy. So far, today is a gross one.  The thing motivating me to peel myself from my bed was the premise of getting the day over with.  I spend a lot of my day waiting for time to expire. I'm fairly certain this is a waste of life.   I'd pay to watch those 12 Mash Shows right now.

      I love walking around the office in my bare feet.  It's carpeted a cool grey blue. In the summer, with the quiet noise of the airconditioner, it makes me feel like I'm wandering around a hotel or maybe even a home. Don't think it's homey here, its not at all. I do spend more time here then anywhere else though. It's more that I make myself right at home here.  It's great to wander in my barefoot over to the fridge and snap open a soda like I'm on summer vacation.  I'm also in the charming habit of having friends over to visit.  Katie is always over here 'coanchoring' the desk with me. She pulls up a chair and the way we behave you'd think we were on lounge chairs with cocktails somewhere- anywhere but at a technical consulting firm.   It eliminates any doubt in passerbys minds that I could be doing anything productive for the company. Katie is considered part of the firm as far as eveyone is concerned.  One day one of the directors from our firm passed Katie in the street and his furrowed his brough in confusion. "What are you doing out here?" he wondered.  Katie, smiled and pointed back at the glimmering black building over her shoulder- "that's where my office is-" amazingly right across the street from the firm.  Again the director looked confused "you have a job??!!"  basically Katie is around so much come wintertime it is hard to imagine someone else is paying her a pretty penny for her time.  Oh well, maybe if they let her have playdates, and her office wasn't' full of intimidatingly well dressed caddy women- we'd convene over there.  As it stands now- this is the hangout.  I have fantastic coworkers who make us laugh and laugh. Also I keep clothes in the coat closet, and a blanket at my desk for when the building gets carried away with the cooling system, peanut butter and jelly in the kitchen cupboard, there's even a couch for when I get sleepy and require a nap!

      I'll start by proclaiming my love and adoration for America.  This Sunday marks the 228th anniversary of our decision to delare our Independence.  Independence is something to be celebrated. I'm sure it was scary for the colonies to make such a bold declaration/seperation, but it was imperative to the birth of what we are today. It is the independence of dear America that makes her who she is. Sometimes when I think about America, how advanced she is for such a young country, how diverse and full of wonder she is, the joy and fun she has brought to my life, how proud I am to be a part of her, I think of Sussy.  Sussy, you are America. You are independent and strong. You live a wonderfully womanly life, (not unlike America). You have a huge heart and you perserve through times&nbsp;that are extremely&nbsp;difficult for you although&nbsp;sometimes its hard to imagine that anything could be wrong cause your life looks so cool,&nbsp; just like America! I'll just sum this up like this:&nbsp; America is exciting, brave and beautiful and so is Sussy, and I love them both very very much.&nbsp;
