      So, I turned 40 this year, got out of a bad relationship (with a man I love(d) very much) and started therapy.  Not so eventful as years go.  In the early phases of therapy Dr. W suggested that I keep a journal.  Not being inclined to pick up the pen I figure this is just as effective.   I started the therapy sessions in order to get over the aforementioned love.  While I was indeed the one to finally end it, I do believe that the decision was not mine alone and there were plenty of mitigating circumstances (as, I suppose, there always are) that made it inevitable. This in no way alleviated the pain that I was/am feeling.  I came to the realization that the reason I was really there was to address other deeper issues that.... blah blah blah.  This must be the most boring topic of all time to someone not involved.  Suffice to say I have stopped drinking.  What is surprising to me is that actually stopping has taken over my life, changed it in such radical ways that I no longer really know, well, anything.  Drinking was the way I related to others.  My whole social life revolved around it.  I would go out after work for a "QO" (quick one) with a few friends. All so innocent and ordinary.  We would deconstruct the day, commiserate over things that had happened at work, talk about the state of our love lives and before you know it that "QO" could very easily turn into 5-6 not-so-quick ones and I'd end up stumbling home drunk.  Or worse, leaving the post work bar and heading out with one or the other of the drinking buddies to another bar.  It wasn't unusual to end up the night at 2,3 or 4am.  That was just the weekdays, then there were the weekends.  Not to mention the occasional drug use that accompanied the booze.  So...   When my relationship broke up I started drinking more heavily.  I didn't have to be home and had no one to answer to and I was able, most of the time, to show up to work the next day only slightly the worse for wear.  (I am downplaying the relationship for the time being but will get into that only slightly more interesting story later.)  It has been 2 and a half weeks since my last drink.  I am still very much in the counting days phase.  I know, I know, "one day at a time" and all that.  And by saying that I don't in any way mean to be dismissive of those wise words.  I am not in AA.  I have huge problems with the notion of "Alcoholism".  I cannot get my mind around the idea of a self-diagnosed disease.  I have absolutely no problem saying that I am an addict.  I have no problem with saying that alcohol was/is a destructive force in my life.  I have no problem saying that all of my problems with alcohol stem from me.  I have huge problems with the concept of a "higher power" .  I have no higher power, or at least not that I can identify.  I have been for many years a confirmed atheist. I do not believe in God, a god, spirit or what-have-you.
