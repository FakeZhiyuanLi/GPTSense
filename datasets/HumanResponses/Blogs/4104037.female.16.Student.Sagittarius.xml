       Killing. Rape. Starvation. Disease. Then you look to the other side of the world and a group of teenage girls are putting on make up and going to clubs looking like, you know what they look like. Teenage girls whose only problems in life are 'oh my gawd, you did NOT just say that to me!' and 'he just looked at that girls butt! can you believe it? the nerve?'... And they dont think for one moment, how lucky we are to be alive right now. Not starving. Well off and we actually have beds to sleep in! It pisses me off how some people are just so ignorant and unhappy, creating little problems for themselves while others, across the world have bigger troubles to deal with. I wish people would be happier, I wish they could see how lucky we are to look around us in this European or American world (whichever you are in) and think to ourselves, you know, I really AM lucky.

       I just realised something while writing to Dmitri. I was in a strange mood and didnt know why... Then I realised that yesterday I was also in a strange mood and my mood today was derived from yesterday, not because I have the same worries but because Im worried that I was worrying because subconsciously, I didnt want my happiness taken away. But Im alright now that Ive figured it out... Its odd how those things work.    I also take conmfort in this blog. I can write things about people and not worry, since no one knowns this is me. Its just 'reality speaking'. I do like comments though, Id like some comments. I think Dmitri is one of a kind... Im not sure if hes a soul mate, but we have so much in common. So much has opened up in emails between us for a whole year... And especially this summer. When I knew him in 9th grade, I didnt get to know him to the extent that I do now. I think we knew there was something connecting us, thats why we talked sometimes. I remember also at lunch, when I was by myself, hed come sit with me. Even if we didnt speak... I felt alright. Im always glad to get emails from him now... Its almost a relief. Even though Im not alone anymore, even though Im not unhappy... And its not a romantic feeling, that somehow frees me. The way that you could have someone close of the opposite sex and not have those feelings get in the way. Thats what went wrong with David... But to a slightly complicated level, since thats not all that went wrong. He didnt respect me. I forgive him though, theres not much of that left in the world. I still miss him sometimes, but I never know what I miss. Its so hard to describe the way I feel about him. I cant love him... Love is happiness.     Whatever there is between me and David is irrelivant now, and Im glad of it. The thing about him is that HE always comes with complications, ALWAYS. And I cant do with that... My life is not complicated anymore. Im free, Im happy, Im young and Im living my life. Im not sure if he is. But either way, Im glad it doesnt involve me. Because what Im doing doesnt involve him.    Im happy to say Ive met the person in this world that is the exact opposite of me, though. And we both know it. Its almost funny. I think he respects me now... I think we both wish each other the best. Its so much easier parted. Its better saying 'I wish you all the best' and going on with our opposite lives. Its good to have this strange and distant connection. It doesnt make sense to anyone but me and him.    And horray for blogger.com... I can let myself go and write all this!

       Alright. Here goes my first entry. Im creating this for me to release the thoughts that slide into my head when I least expect them. Also, I have another weblog on the internet but its somewhere else and my friends have access to it. Id like to see what happens to my writing and thoughts when I know that no one who I know will read it.       An introduction to me: Im going into 11th grade. I live in Rome. I go to an international school. I recently became optimistic and have no doubts other than society is pulling itself into a black hole, yet again, but whats new about that? What else is there to give in an introduction except for a few facts and thoughts. And that will be included in all the entries after this one. So the only thing special about this is that its the first time Im writing. But once again, whats so special? Why not jump right in.      A few moments later... Have you ever started thinking, and thought what are you thinking and youre trying to figure out what it was you were thinking before you started wondering about your thoughts? That just happened to me so now Im lost and am trying to freshen up my thoughts for complete strangers who will either take interest in my life or not. But beware: this is not my life. I love writing, but I dont care to write about my life. Other than a few basic points. Theres not much to write about, because I am happy.  And when youre happy youre carefree as your life goes. Id like to improve other peoples lives and the world, now that Ive improven my world and life. I found over the years that Im great at advise, esspecially if I was once in the same place. Then I can tell people how exactly I solved that problem for me, or just listen and give comfort. I dont want to be a psychologist though. After I read The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath (which was amazing) I started seeing crazy people everywhere... I counted 5 in a week. Thats more than Ive ever seen in a year. It frightens me... Id rather not have other peoples lives in my hands. I just want to help my friends, because I know thet my friends have helped me become who I am.      I also helped MYSELF become who I am because you get no where depending on other people. But thats what a friend once told me, so now Im a bit confused. I guess it goes both ways. Theres no freedom in either solitude or dependence.      HEY! I love that, I think Ill write that down!!! Sometimes I cant believe the words I come up with. That could be concidered a 'quote'. How cool. I made up a quote. Haah.
