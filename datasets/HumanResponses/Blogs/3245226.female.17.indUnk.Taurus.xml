      Hiya...Yupz...its the afternoon alright. hey, I'm suppose to go to town but nobody wanna go or too busy to come with me. i sooooo need to get tht Substance shoes i've yearned for so oh very very long...  Well..here goes. That guy called at about 8.30pm but he called using his hp. so we cldn't talk long lah (pre-paid ppl will understand). Haiz..this is even worst compared to Isnin. Said he'd called back but =( he didn't...Sad..hehehe  Though he messaged me at like 12midnight!! hahah...said he cldn't call cuz there was a problem with his home phone. haiz..missing his deep deep voice..swoooon..  Like i said...me heart has never melted tht many times b4 but this guy...  i mean, i've always been able to gurad myself from this kinda thing for as long as i can remeber. my heart has NEVER melted for a guy b4 u know. my previous crushes were just tht and my heart weren't involved at all. Why him..why now...  Oh oh oh...he msged this: there are so many guys out there who are better than me...so why do i like him instead??? Damn...i've heard tht being uttered by guys over and over again. Wat ever is wrong? why must they doubt why we like them??? huh???? I mean...can't u believe that ppl might actually like u for who u are? why compare yourself?! AAARGGHHH  Damn..now it the woman who don't get it! ahahaha.. And tht's life i tell you. lame and fun at the same time. Absolutely nuts..

      I have so much to let you know. First let me start with the mundane stuffs: Btw, i got into Ngee Ann Poly and i'll be starting soon on the 28 June. So far now..I'm either lazin' arnd at home or giving tuitions to my cousins...I'll be taking FMB (Facilities Mgt For Biz)  Okay Moving on...I'm oh-so-absolutle-sure I'm over Isnin (my previous crush- damn da guy to hell lah). Phew! Escaped unscathed..  but now...i gotta another crush. let me tell u how da hell i even knew him.. My primary sch friend Iqlimah asked my one day to accompny her to the HDB place near Lot1. So we met up, went there and headed back. Pretty lame ain't it???  So in he LRT she saw her friend's ex (i think)...and she asked me to look whether he was cute or not..and (i think again) i said "yeah..he's alright"..  We dropped off at the Bukit Panjang LRT station and then she told me to go on first and she'll cathc up with me. so i went to the lift. Few minutes later(the lift has yet to arrive) she joined me..we chatted and then went back home.  A couple of days later, she msged me saying tht the guy in the lrt wanted my no. and so i replied "sure why not? no harm rite.." haiz...WHY WHY WHY!!?? So few days later then he msged me...called me too. hahaha...  found out he's nuts over rock music. well good for him..at least he has a passion in life which is music...but for some ppl...haiz..sad lah..  so blah blah blah...we talked and he let me listen to some rock musics but then i had to go..A couple of weeks later(or was it days?) he called again. talked some more for 3WHOLE HOURS!! damn my sis is sooooo gonna kill me when she sees the phone bill AyEaYeAyeAyE  hehee...

      Yet another day i'm living in. Its those days...Why is it that i feel as though i'm living thru' Groundhog Day? Oh well, what more can one expect when she is feeling all lazy. I'm getting sick alright. Darn it but its no fun to get sick where your nose is blocked ad you feel hot and cold at the same time plus having headaches and bodyaches..Haiz...now i'm housesitting at my aunt's place. My cousins out to school already and i'm left to die in this house. HAHAHA...  I'm suppose to read my Nicole Jordan's The Passion. my bestfriend hidayu says its one damn good book! All Nicole Jordan's books are hott hott hott and very very very steamy..sheesh So instead of reading i'm here typing out things i have no clue wat the hell i'm talking about. let me see whats there to tell...hey wanna know wats my hobby?  Definitely READING.  R-E-A-D-I-N-G . I don't think its a hobby but more of just enjoying reading. I especially enjoy Historical Romance books. Dunno why but i remeber getting hooked like 2yrs back... So far, I've been quite obsessed with going to the library and searching for my beloved books.  Hmmm...  So far i have a compilation of my fav authors. They are  Julia Quinn (romantic and very very hilarious),  Andrea Kane (somber and romantic), Nicole Jordan(extremely steamy!!),  Linda Lael Miller (covers mostly on my dearest cowboys yeehaw!),  Catherine Coulter  (Medieval mama),  Julie Garwood (hott hott hott) etc. Kinda crazy don't ya think???  There i told you i have no clue wat i'm typing about. Gosh, da medicine i took just now is seriously threatening my eyes to just close but the stubborness in me won't allow it. i don't wanna sleep but at the same time i wanna...D*MN..hahahahah  hmmmm...okay my brains are just to mushed to type or tell ya anything else. that'll be another time then yar. If whoever is reading this and gets confuse for wateva reason...pardon me, but its the medicine's fault yar.  there there..i'll stop blabbering. get back to ya laterz(maybe when the doziness have drown). TATA
