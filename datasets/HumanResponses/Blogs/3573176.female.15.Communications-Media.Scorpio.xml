       Beyonce- Daddy  I remember when you use to take me on a  Bike ride everyday on the bayou (you remember that? we were inseparable)  And I remember when you could do no wrong  You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you  I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)   Because you loved me I overcome  And I'm so proud of what you've become  You've given me such security  No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me  You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain  You understood my fears and you protected me  Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why?br>  I want my unborn son to be like my daddy  I want my husband to be like my daddy  There is no one else like my daddy  And I thank you for loving me   I still remember the expression on your face  When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend (my first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)  I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo  Could have said beyonce I told you so  Instead you said you'd get one too (even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)   Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you  I appreciate what you do  You've given me such security  No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me  You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain  You understand my fears and you protected me  Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why?br>  I want my unborn son to be like my daddy  I want my husband to be like my daddy  There is no one else like my daddy  And I thank you for loving me   Even if my man broke my heart today  No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay  Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced  For this love is unconditional it won't go away  I know I'm lucky  Know it ain't easy  For men who take care of their responsibilities  Love is overwhelming  Can't help my tears from falling  I love you so much daddy   (Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)   I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you  I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you  There is no one else like my daddy  No one else replace my daddy...

       yo peepz, how's ur holiday so far? For me, everyday is the same routine.. wake up, breakfast, read this story book, really nice " all american girl" i think tis book is really cool, it's not that girly type of story book.. the character is really funny.. sumtimes i tink we have the same character.. after that i sit in front of the computer, i will debate with myself ( whether to go online)  Whenever I online, i will see this stupid ANG KIAN KEONG a.k.a King Kong, always "suan" me, damn pervert, this guy.ALWAYS WATCH PORN! I mean him, not me, i very "guai" de. After that, i will hear usher's song.. cos i m addicted to it. Then latr, i will hear linkin park's song. I think i m a bit behind time, it's only recently that i discovered some songs from the previous album  .. Rocks! After i offline, THen that clarence will sms me and tok abt his amanda, he kept telling me abt her, yet he kept denying that he dun like her. If it's not clarence, then it's C.K. He always sms and say " ello, wat u doin" lol... C.k is a new friend i've made. Same as me, a die-hard Linkin Park fan. ( plus loves simple plan) ROCK ON..er.. his character quite good, not like that stupid ang kian keong.. After that Ah kiao will call my house, and criticise my bao zha tou. LOL... HELLO? ARE U SLEEPING? I DUN BLAME YOU. THIS IS HOW BORING MY LIFE DURING HOLIDAYS IS. ZzzZZZzzZZZzzZZZZzzZZZZzZZZZZ (",)

Found it  Usher- Burn I don't understand why See it's burning me to hold onto this I know this is something I gotta do But that don't mean I want to What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just I feel like this is coming to an end And its better for me to Let it go now than hold on and hurt you I gotta let it burn  [Verse 1] It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think you're gonna change I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over We knew it been through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to Got somebody here but I want you Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself Callin' her your name Ladies tell me do you understand? Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? It's the way I feel I know I made a mistake Now it's too late I know she ain't comin back What I gotta do now To get my shorty back Ooo ooo ooo ooooh Man I don't know what I'm gonna do Without my booo You've been gone for too long It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)  [Chorus]  I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down  and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me  that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?) Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh  So many days, so many hours I'm still burnin' till you return  Juz forget abt the oooh part, cos im definitely not oohing... blech..

        my family are not at home tonite.. they are at turf city shopping.. I'm alone at home. Do u noe wad is the best thing to do when ur family are not at home? THE ANSWER IS TO HEAR LINKIN PARK!!  lol.. i m a bit crazy le.. today i went to watch the prizoner of azkaban with felicia, Eileen, felicia's sis Dalicia, and her neighbour, ming xiang..Ming xiang is a bit xtra, coz he's the only person who did not wear bra (as felicia says) lol..duh..  Ming Xiang went home early, so after that me and Eileen STRONGLY suggest we go heeren. When we reach, we were approach by the really chio bu.. ask us to join the ladies club.. ladies club? Sound stupid. So I bluff all the way thru'. I already hint to her that i m not keen to join.. but she kept toking.. but in the end, we manage to get away. So we went to take neoprint. Big mistake. I look really suxs in the pic, and felicia's looking kind of like "siao cha bo"    After that we went to HMV.. OMG.. HMV is the greatest place on the earth.. I was hearing Enrique Iglesis, " addicted" and then suddenly a lady press the button stop..! I was looking at the Justin Timberlake cd, and she thought there is nobody listening.. so she switch off.. damn....DAMN!!!I was like, "wad the hell~?" She saw me and apologise.. GRRR...I saw LiNKIN PARK's CD!!! i mean there's an mtv.. so i went to hear it.. omg.. "sumwhere i belong" mtv.. really roxs. WEnfeei biao ge says that their mtv is based on anime, i think it's kinda true. AND CHESTER>> he is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute...!i mean, on the first look, u will think he looks "blech!" but if u take a closer look, u will see he is really, really cute. I like tix type of guys. They call them the dark horse. Yeah, I tink dark horse is better than white horse, wat do ya think? like clay aiken, he looks really cute when u look closer, and when he wear specs he looks even cuter.. THAT'S MY KIND OF DREAM GUY. Wat do ya think?
