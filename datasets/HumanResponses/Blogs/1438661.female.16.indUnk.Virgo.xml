      I decided to bring this back, because yanno, i dont have friends so ill pretend someone is reading this and caring.  I deleted the old post because, reading them is really really really depressing!  ALOT has gone on, ALOT. but i wont bore you, just with the important things. Me and Mike are not together, so im looking *hint hint*. Im jobless, but trying to find one, and one suprise i wont reveal yet : x, and thats actually about it.  Tomorrow is Kayla 1st birthday! woo, its gonna be fun, theres going to be about 70 people here tomorrow and lots of little kids running around! Me and Justine are switching rooms and i cannot wait, her bedroom is like 1000000 x times better than mine.  the only negetive is, its upstairs and i'll miss living in the basement, ill get over it... I feel like the only loser thats home on a Saturday night. SAVE ME! im in a rut, all i do is sleep, wake up, watch tv, eat, get online, sleep.  EVERYDAY.  i am so boring.  i need a man...or some friends....

      today was good...kinda. I went to the mall to apply to Pottery Barn Kids, but they said they werent hiring, so i got some chic-fil-a instead :)  then i went home and complained. Then went back to the mall and applied to this little toddler store in the mall and i have an interview tomorrow! yay!  I would love to work there, even though the manager was a little scary. Then i was feelin' good so I went to the gym with my mom and burned some fat. Then went to the grocery store to gain it all back.  Now i'm burned out and want to go to sleep...

I need to work out tomorrow too. :(  but im not just saying this. I HAVE TO DO THIS OR ILL GO CRAZY!  I cant wait to move upstairs my room is so depressing and cold. Just one more month...  Today Kayla tried to get up and walk, but she just looked like a retard trying to do flips. I need some new clothes.

      The movies was so cute. It was funny in the beginning but at the end i was about to cry. I recommend it.  I dont remember the last time I've actually seen a  movie in a theater.  Today was a pretty good day.  I didnt find any shoes, and i need some for work. After the mall i went to dairy queen, yummm. And thats about it.  I need to start going out more often.

      Dinner was okay i guess.  Except the interrogation part, food was yummy though.  I dont know if I'm still going out tomorrow, i read that one of my friends has the chicken pox, for the second time, i didnt know that was possible. I hope we still go though, or I'll be bored.  If we dont then i'll have to find something else to do, I do not feel like sittting at home another night...

      I finally got my stuff today for homeschooling, and wow is it easy.  All i basically have to do is copy answers. I think I'll be graduated by the end of the summer, yay!  My family got picked for this TV show too. I dont think anyone whos reading this watches it though, because im the 16 year old that i know that watches HGTV.  Anyways the show is called Designers Challenge, and well yeah. Thats about it....

      Im feeling better. Just woke up, on the wrong side of the bed earlier.  I went to lunch with my dad, which was pretty bad as usual.  Then went shopping for maternity clothes, because i cant even button my real pants anymore.  I got one cute outfit, nothing else was in my size.  I had to go to Bowie, because thats the only old navy that sells maternity clothes, and wow it got ghettoer.  Every person there was black and nasty.  Its like an upscale ghetto, if theres such thing.  Then I went to my sisters and saw Kayla, and played scattagories. My boring Saturday night....

      I had another bad dream last night.  Except this one i was covered in bugs, i think they were ticks, and i was trying to get them all off but i couldnt.  I also had to work :( It wasnt so bad but i feet are dieing, It doesnt matter what kind of shoe i wear my feet always kill me.  I really wish i had my old job back.  I have to work alot this week :(I had a really good dinner tonight though, we got boston market, and i had their yummy yummy meatloaf and then i had Maggie Moo's, I am obsessed with their vanilla icecream (with chocolate sprinkles).  I have alot to do tomorrow since its basically my only day off.  I feel really stressed, because I'm suposse to be moving upstairs soon and i dont have any furniture.

      Went furniture shopping today...no luck.  I found the perfect bed but it doesnt come in black.  I need so much stuff. I had some bad dreams last night...Has anyone ever been to Port Discovery? Well i have and my dream was kinda like that but for adults, and it was more futuristic.  It was kinda like a time machine and we could go into the past and the future..and i blew up the earth :(  Then my dreams suddenly switched to being at my house and going up to my sisters room, but suddenly at the top of the steps this ghost starts pulling be back down, and Justine and Elisha are trying to pull me in the room, they finally do but the ghost keeps after me, but then i woke up : \  My feet hurt so bad from work, i really despise working there.  It was easier than cheeburger but its way boring.  I hope i dont have to work tomorrow.

I have to work firday and i dont want to, i dont like working there, i really miss working a cheeburger :(  Maybe i can get my job back..again

      i've been so tired lately, i had 12 hours or sleep last night and im already dieing to sleep.  I had a pretty active day today, went grocery shopping, and clothes shopping. Then watched Matchstick Men, Ive already seen in before, but its just one of those movies you can see twice. Time for sleep

      so i wake up upset.... So i decide to listen to the baby's heartbeat, i felt a little better.  Then I felt this little movement inside, and was like 'hmm" so i put my hand on my tummy and a keep feeling it, and it went on for like another minute, then stopped.  But i felt the baby move for the first time, and it made my day.  Its a really weird, kinda annoying feeling.  Ive never been up this early in my life, maybe ill take a shower and go back to sleep...

       i went to Lizas play yesterday, Joeseph and the techinicolor dreamcoat, it was...interesting, i didnt really follow, but thats okay.  Then got some chili's, i forgot there was even one in bowie.  Then i had to go shopping all day today because i got yelled at yesterday for wearing a patterned top, so i had to search every maternity shop for a plain shirt that actually fit,  i found two at old navy, they're not that attractive but they're plain.  Work was so dead, and boring, and pointless.  I got my check it was only for 100 dollars, but i didnt work that much those weeks so i can understand why...but this next pay check is going to be alot because i work almost everyday.  I really think people my age need to grow up now,  i dont understand why anyone would want to date someone, whos a loser, doesnt go to school or if they do, is like a million grades behind, gets arrested, smokes, drinks, an ass...i just dont get the attraction.  And some of the girls are actually decent and nice. oh well...

      Not a very interesting day, went to work, was busy.  Then ate at sbarro's alone :(  Never again will i do that, i felt so akward. Then I waited for Justine to get home and we went to Ikea, and i got a picture and new shower curtain and some nick nacks.  Then we went to chili's and had a really bad waiter that messed up EVERYTHING.  I'm on call tomorrow at 3, i hope i dont have to because i kinda want to go to this show, Ill probably go after anyways because i only have to work till 6 or something like that. So we'll see  :) Goodnight.

      My feet hurt :(  I didnt have to work at 2 today, thank god because i was so tired.  I worked at 6 instead, and it was pretty busy tonight, unusual for a friday night... oh well, Amber and her boyfriend came by and visited me for a second,  i was hoping my away message would persuade people because it gets boring. I think I'm going to Ikea tomorrow, If nobody else wants to do anything with me. I need to get a new shower curtain and stuff and get a new spare part to my dresser. Hope and pray they have it and its cheap!  Well i have to shower :)

      I decided i would paragraph because its easier to read because the font is so small :) Work wasnt as good today, I didnt get to ring many people up because this other pregnant lady stole all the customers.  And i wore THE most uncomfortable shoes, I have bruises on my toes from em'. I have to work again tomorrow at 2 than again on saturday at 1, but I'm going to ask my sister to work for me on Saturday because i dont want to work with the icky manager that hate me. And i dont wanna work everyday of my life.  I better get a big freakin pay check.  Speaking of money I got my ATM card fixed today! YAY! it wasnt working because i tried so many pin numbers that it had to be reset.  I have to deposit my other pay check today, i couldnt do that because my sister hd it and the bank was about to close so i just went up and got my card fixed.  I might work saturday....i need the money. Im saving up for a new computer or a new car, and cant decide which one.    And today me and my mom decided what might be my career.  Real Estate.  Its easy, can make alot of money, and i enjoy doing that kind of thing.  I dont want to be one of those weird peole who make a career of working at some stupid store all their life, I want a real career.  So when Im 18 i can go to real estate school and get my real estate liscence.  Im not sure if thats really what i want to do though. The lady I work with  that is pregnant also is only a month ahead of me but she looks like a freakin blimp.  I guess because it is her 3rd. Time for some sleepage...

And its only a year old, i'll learn to take care of my new one though, because ill get a super duper like best of computers and itll be my baby

      i hate sunday's, they are so boring.  I basically did nothing, just went to bed bath & beyong, maggie moo's and tj maxx.  I'm on call tomorrow for work, i dont feel like working.  I need another day off than I'm good, especially because Kayla is coming over tomorrow, and i need to go bathing suit shopping and furniture shopping.  I kinda dont want to move upstairs, but I dont have a choice, I need to.  I think it will grow on me.  I had a good night yesterday

      Hm, so today i went to the grocery store and got lots of good stuff like hot fudge :)  And the cashier at the check out counter was telling me and my mom how she wanted another kid, but her husband didnt.  My mom asked why and she said because his last wife was on drugs and burned down her house and killed their 4 year old child.  Proving drugs are bad, for all you druggies out there.  Then i went off to work, and did some boring stuff like put out the sale stuff and shoes, but it wasnt so bad becuase i was kept busy rather than just putsing around...  And tomorrows friday! yayyy that means only 4 more days till my sonogram. than i can start the nursery and buy lots of clothes .  Im alost done my painting, probably another 2 or 3 days or maybe ill finish it tomorrow if i dont have to work.  Im really happy with the way its turning out.  I always mean to go up to cheeburger but i always wake up to late because aarons usually only there till 4..and i never feel like getting ready or anything, so if i go to bed early enough maybe ill get around to it...

      ive started this new habit of waking up at 12 everyday, saying hi to kayla than eating 2 bowls of cinnamon toast crunch.  ANd i usually go the mall everyday too.    ot a very good habit, because 12 is a little late. and cinnamon toast crunch isnt too healthy. and the mall. well its just the mall.  Anyways today was pretty good day. Got a few things done. started on a picutre. and thats about it. Hope i dont have to work tomorrow...goodnight

He was better than anyone else on there, it makes me not want to watch the show, but theres only one more left so i have to... Anyways  I didnt do much today, just went to target, got baby things, and went to the grocery store annnd made some yummy taco thing.  I got my TV up here today, now i can sleep tonight.

      So Im in my new room.  Its gonna take some getting used to, i feel like Im in a hotel room. Im really bored because my TV isnt up here yet, and I never not have my tv on.  Im kinda satisfied with the way things turned out,  Im just kinda bothered my where my tv is going to be, Sigh...ill figure out something. Ive been going up and down stairs all day.  I kinda miss my old room but I'll get over it.  I dont really have much to do tomorrow except the final touches...Maybe Ill do some school work I havent touched my books in weeks, and The Apprentice comes on tomorrow, yay.  I lost one of my pay checks so i have to find that tomorrow too and than deposit them.  My belly is getting pretty big,  and im sick of wearing the same thing everyday because of this crappy weather.  Im pretty tired from doing crap all day, so night...

They gave me lots of pictures, they couldnt get a good one of her face though because she kept hiding it.  But shes healthy and normal and good :) Afterwards  we went to Red Robin and ate, than went to old navy and got cute little girl clothes, and than i came home and started moving things into my new room, it'll be official tomorrow,  I get my new things and everything  else is goin' in.  So I have to wake up early because im on call at 6, phooey.  well night'

      It was a weird day.  Alot of good things happen, and alot of bad things happened. but anyways.  So i woke up got ready and off to the dentist,  no cavities, but i have to get my wisdom teeth taken out in 6 months :( im so scared. So when that was done, got some chick-fil-a and went home and ordered my new desk.  Then me and Justine go to Best Buy to get hers, but they didnt have it.  On the way to Best Buy we passed the Annpolis Junque Boutique, its a little used furniture thing, ive never been to it before and always thought it was a crappy place.  But when we passed it i saw this couch that i liked.  So we stopped and the guy was like "yeah ill give it to you for 100", so i was like woohoo ill take it, but than he said he had a few different couches, and he showed us this beautiful 50's/60's couch,  it has this great silk fabric with this floral design on it, and it was 185..so i thought about it, and said you gotta deal.  It came on two different pieces so you could use it seperatley or as an L shape.  So we couldnt fit it in the car so for 15 they followed us and took it upstairs.  Then my mom beign ridiculous gave them a 30 dollar tip, they werent very nice, but i dont think they got paid the guy said they were volunteers, so i guess its good they got something.  So we came home went to target, got some desk parts. And thats about it.  They carpet cleaners come tomorrow so I think they are cleaning my couch,  its way dirt but in great shape.  I have my sonogram tomorrow too. Then right after i think im going to eat with the family but than shopping!!! yayyy, im so excited...

      So today was a pretty interesting and productive day.  My mom woke me up at 9:30, but it being me i fell back asleep and woke up at 10.  Got ready and drove up to beltsville to mastercraft.  Saw a few things, and the few things i liked were already sold.  It was really busy there.  So we decided to go to Marlo's, and I found a dresser, a nightstand, and another nightstand to use as a tv stand.  Im going to order my desk offline tomorrow, and then all i have left is my couch.  Im trying to find a deal somewhere, i found one at pier one but it only came in denim, which wouldnt match.    So we ran home so i could get ready for work, got ready, dreading it. And it was pretty bad day, i only did 57 percent of my goal, because I'm not a register hog, and i actually do work instead of sitting there waiting for people.  But anyways I put this cute litte nighty for the baby on hold, its pink and has little pineapples on it.  Then i came home and everyone was gone except Justine, and she told me dad wanted to take us out to dinner, and i was all bummed but had no choice.  So I got ready and we met my dad at chili's and ate.  Then me and justine went to cheeburger and i got a chocolate peanut butter shake:)  Afterwards me and Justine decided to go to the mall to pick up that nighty i put on hold.  And i ended up getting more, i got this yellow dress and matching sweater and the nighty (as you can tell I'm praying its a girl, if its not Ill just return it, but I had to get it before someone else snatched it), and Justine bought a present for Kayla.  Oh and we are doing March Of Dimes donations at work, which helps little babies that are born premature and have birth defects, so come in and make a donation.  We only ask customers for a dollar, but if you want to make more, do so, I only made 5, but I'm sure ill donate more when i get more money.  And buy my baby something while your at it ;)  So me and Justine came home to an empty house and were wondering where my mom and Rick were.  So I called but they didnt answer so we were like "oh they are probably at Copelands"  because they go there every freakin weekend.  We went up there but they werent there.  So then i though, they are probably at the wharfside, but on the way, Justine though, hey ya know they might be at Mike's (the resturaunt) so we went there and there they were sitting at the bar of course.  So we sat down with them and i got some yummy peanut butter pie, and talked about plans for the baby and the new pool.  Some lady came over earlier from a pool company to design a plan for our pool.  It'll have a hot tub with a waterfall, a heated pool, a swim up bar, an outdoor kitchen and a firepit, my house will be the party house ;). haha Rick is a little to excited about it as you can tell.  We might not do the bar though.  Theres another pool company coming Wednesday to give is another estimate and design.  But they said they liked this girl.  So tomorrow is my organization day. I need to get things ready to move,  and then monday i have to go to the dentist, and tuesday is my sonogram, eekk! well im wiped and talked to much. goodnight.

      i feel so wasteful.  I feel like Im wasting time, and money, and everything.  Today I went shopping again of course and wasted money on clothes and baby clothes that i really didnt need to get.  Than i sat around wasting time.  My room is a disaster, Ive been trying to get my desk together but the drawers are really hard. So parts are lying all over the place and nothings finished, i still have  boxes to unpack, i feel really disorganized, which makes me feel stressed.  I canceled plan with someone today, which was stupid because i ended up doing nothing and just regreting it. I always do that. :\  Now i know if make a list of things i have to do tomorrow i will end up not doing them so if i dont, maybe i will actually do them.  So goodnight.

      Today started off pretty rocky.  I had to watch Kayla for a couple of hours, and she was being a big brat. But than my mom came home, and we went grocery shopping, and we saved 23 dollars today, with the magic of coupons. We've never really used coupons like that before, it was fun, and it felt good to save all that money. Then I came home anf pigged out on the food we got, and than me and Justine and everyone went to the gym and worked out for an hour, came back and ruined it with McDonalds :) And Justine and Elisha picked up  Something Gotta Give,  it was really cute, but I didnt really enjoy seeing the old people do it.  And thats about it...

I didnt do much of anythign today,  got some outback, becasue ive been craving it for the last week.  I got some school work accomplished, and just rested and be happy all day.  Tomorrow I have to run errands, and go to the grocery store and all that good stuff.  My mom said since i dont have a job, shes going to take the 200 dollars a month my dad gives me and double it to 400 and just give it to me, to do what i need to so for my resposibities, i can save it in my savings, or buy things for the baby, do what i gotta do.  So thats good, I can rest and dont have to worry about work, and now i can really concentrate on school and getting it done.  Time for sleep...

      So today i woke up early. Got ready, threw up breakfast because ill never ever ever stop getting morning sickness.  Then Crystal called right before i was going to leave to tell me to come in an hour later...oh thanks, i could have slept that hour.  But oh well, i went in, signed up a few people, got some free things.  Than came home bored as anything, trying to see if Justine wanted to do anything, she fell asleep and i watched room raiders for like 2 hours.  Than her friend called and we went out with some of her friends to Red Robins, came home, ate 3 mini icecream sandwhiches

      hmm well i didnt ge to go out today.  I woke up really late like 1 :30, ate and be home alone some more.  Justine came home and we decided to go to the mall, so we putzed around there for a while and I got some new sunglasses.  After that we had to go visit Rick in the hosptial because he had a minor heart attack yesterday.  We picked up Brian, picked up Kayla, and than picked up Crystal and off to Virginia.  We got there and the lady on the intercom said "visiting hours are now over". gasp! we didnt not drive an hour away to be told that, so we snuck in his room and stayed there for a while.  I was starving so I stopped and got a happy meal on the way back, and inhaled it!  Im thinking about maybe getting a few people together and going to Ocean City this weekend, since its suposse to be really warm, so if youre interested let me know. Right now I think I'll head off to sleep.

Im very happy with it, I put up all my pictures and put everything else away and its lookin' good. Then by the time I was done Crystal walked in with Kayla, she was sleeping, but woke up once she heard my loudness. So I pigged out on cheese and crackers, until finally everyone else showed up, and then i pigged out on all the yumminess

      Its official, I cant see my feet when I look down,  I kinda have to peek over "oh yeah there they are". Anyways today was busy, dont feel like explaining it all.  But I opened up two new bank accounts, heh, Im 16 and already have 3 bank accounts, not a bad thing I guess..... Well my mom has always wanted to move to Idaho, and we are actually considering a second home there, not this year, but maybe the next or the year after.  And before I was like oh no, Idaho, Ill be leaving everything! haha but you know what I dont have anything that important thats holding me back anymore. So Im considering moving to Idaho in the next year or two.

      The weather man can die! Is he ever right,  on Monday he said " this will be the last sunny day we will see", pffft. wow so the weekend is already here, no plans as of yet, hint hint. Heh, no matter what kind of hint i give itll probably just be like every other day,  weekends dont mean anything to me, its not like, i work or go to school.  Well today I went to ikea, Justine had to return something, so I ended up bying something of course, I just cant control myself, I have spending issues.  I REALLY didnt need it either, i regret buying it now, it was just a 9 dollar picture, but thats 9 dollars right out of my baby's (and my) mouth.  I could of...bought something useful with it, but oh well, cant take it back now.  I also bought some new pillow cases, because my bright white ones dont match my new comfoter.  They were pretty expensive..for Ikea.  What i really needed were some new lamp shades, but the one I liked wasnt in stock, I guess it was a hint, to STOP.  Afterwards, i was dieing of hunger, so we went searching for a Wendys but no luck, but we got Taco Belle instead.  Its quite a talent to eat tacos in the car, they like gush out everywhere, but I managed.On the way home, Justine was talking about how when I turn 18, shell probably be going to Salsbury, or um however you spell it, and we should rent an apartment or buy like a town house together. Sounds liek a good idea to me, Like I can afford either by myself,  just kinda weird, Id rather it be with a friend, but my sister will do. And then once her and Elisha get married Ill be kicked to the curb : /  So anyways, right when we pulled up we saw my mom outside with Kayla, she went over the neighbors, so we decided to be rude and come in too :)  There house was okay, nice paint.  But there kitchen wasnt much, they didnt have the nice countertops and they had this icky lamenant floor. When we came home Rick turned on Finding Nemo, I had nothing else to do, so watched it. I didnt get to pay much attention to it the first time because of somebody i know. Then ordered some food from Pizza and Taco Express, it was okay, wasnt all that. And here I am! and now i go, goodnight all.

      So here I am, with an ugly oversized rubber band that has chunks of hair in it.  I cant seem to let it go, im really supersticious, i think its good luck :)  The past few days have been interesting.  I bought a crib, I learned about "the down low", lol it was on Oprah, like men that ARENT gay but sleep with other men.  Weird, I know.  Rick came home today form the hospital, there are ghost's in my house,  I am being ignored, and Im going to the beach tomorrow. I believe that is the past 3 days in a nutshell!

      I was having the best nights sleep i've had in a while, and then Justine wakes me up ..early, telling me I have to watch Kayla.  I thought I was going to die, you had no idea how much I just wanted to be dreaming.  Expecially because nobody would be back all day.  But fortunelty my mom came back after about a half hour, from the gym. I thought they were in Virgina but they told me they were going after they got cleaned up.  So I though, I have nothing to do but sit here and watch her, so ill just come with.  So we went to Virginia, went to Crate & Barrel, got some new cups, and other random things.  And alot of other random places, and then went to eat a Uno's.  It wasnt that good, and considering i was sick all day, didnt make anything better. All Kayla did today was whine, we havent seen her in about a week, and all she does is fuss! Anyways...  We came home, gave her a bath, played with her, and then Crystal came over and we talked for about an hour, took Kayla, and than, got stuff ready for the community yard sale tomorrow.  Everyone in the community is having a yard sale in there lawn tomorrow..should be fun, but I have to wake up early,  then go get a birthday present for someone, and then go to some cinco de mayo party (is that how you spell it?)  So a very very busy day tomorrow, better get some rest ;)

      ouh my feet hurt. Today was pretty busy.  I woke up, early, because the roofers were working on our roof, and being extremely loud.  So i went to go eat, and i threw it up, havent done that in a while, and then ate some more.   I got ready, went up to the mall,  bought something at pottery barn, the lady there pressured me into registering, so if you wanna buy something for baby either for the baby shower, or just to be nice, im registered there, and im gonna go register at target and babies r' us, and maybe a few other places, just to let you know :)  oh jeez and if i dont get asked enough " awww how many months are you" or "when are you due", "do you know what it is?", random people will ask, the attention is nice, but the same questions over and over isnt. So anyways I came home ate some more, and me and Justine were sitting up in her room, Custus was drooling on me, or snotting on me, whatever it was, and we decided we were bored, so she asked "should i get bangs?".  Sure why not Justine.  We went off, and thought that the only place she could get her hair cut without and appointment was hair cuttery, she was so nervous, becasue the people there arent that fantastic, but we went through with it.  She was telling me all in the car "i really hope a guy doesnt do my hair". So we walk in, and the receptionist is  this older asian guy, with a horrible accent.  Of course, he says "okay, i go ahead and do your hair".  You should of seen the look on her face, she was ready to back out but, she didnt.  he said "don' worry, I proffesional!" Knowing it would be hard to explain to him, we asked for a book to show what we were looking for. So we sit down for him to cut her hair and he has no clue what hes doing really, some lady had to come over and show him.  He was a really nice guy though, I felt bad because i couldnt really understand anything he was asking me.  In the end, Justines hair turned out good, she doesnt like it too much, but I do, shes goign to get it "fixed" tomorrow.  Afterwards we went to South Moon Under, saw some cute bathing suits, and this necklace i really liked, it was 40 dollars though,  it wasnt anything special either. somethign i would pay 15 max for.  So now i have this yearning for a new necklace, the one i have, ive had for a year, i wear it everyday, and its just my old ID chain, I think its seen its days.  So I went up to the mall again, looking in every store for a new necklace, but nothing.  I go get some food at Steak Escape, and here I am.

      Everyday, moving to Idaho just seems like a better idea.  Im so sick of everyone here, they all have their heads stuck up their butts, not all people, but alot.  Im sick of worrying all the time.  I KNOW i'll miss some things in Maryland, and Ill probably think that it was bad idea, but after a while I will get over everything and realize that it was a very good desicion. When we go to Montana this year in June, I think we are going to look at some houses in Idaho, and I can make my final desicion.  ahh how I love being pregnant, (and hate it) but I dont ever have to worry about my weight, its so nice, to eat whatever I want and wear whatever I want. :)  She has been causin' a riot in my stomach, i dont think she EVER stops moving.  Its pretty annpying sometimes, especially in the morning, when I dont want to wake up, but I have to pee so bad, and shes kickin my bladder. grrrrr.  I got a crib mattress today, so the nursery is basically finished.  All we need to do is paint the walls, and move all the old things out of that room.  Tomorrow, what am I going to do? I havent a clue, Maybe Ill...buy some paint and have my mom paint the room, I wish I could paint so bad, I love painting.  Or I could celan, or i could do both.  Oh my goodness, today must of been my lucky day, I lost one of my old checks from gymobree a month ago (worth alot of money), and have been looking frantically all over for it since, so Im cleaning the babies closet out, and I take out this teddy bear from this Pottery Barn bag , and there it is!! I feel so un-poor and less stressed now, its going straight the the bank tomorrow so I don't lose it again! I have a real problem sleeping now, for one my bed isnt the most comfortable, and I just cant sleep, it takes me forever.  So Im up till forever if anyone ever wants to call me and keep me company, theres usually nothing on tv at night, after Oprah.  Well I guess I'm done, Ive got nothing else. So goodnight

      Not much happened today. Except a woke up with a damn Charlie Horse in my leg AGAIN.  You know how you stretch in your bed when you wake up, well I did that about two days ago, and got the worse charlie horse in my right leg.  Like this was the mother of all Charlie horses,  So the pain went away and I tried to put my leg down, but then another one came!  Well anyways I wake up and I get one in my left leg! what the hell!!  Now Im scared to stretch anymore!

      I just finished watching the last friends episode, and yes I cried :( It was so cute, I love the way it ended.  Makes me sad that theres no more...Well since I didnt write yesterday...actually I dont even remember what I did yesterday.  All I can remember is I ate Chinese food.  Today I went shopping again.  But I went to Columbia Mall.  I bought a new dress, It looks SO good off the hanger, and okay on.  I liked the way it looked on me at the store better than when I got home and put it on, so i might have to return it.  Thats basically all I did today.  Tomorrow I believe I am going to Liza's house, shes having people over because shes a bad girl and her parents are out of town and something about AP tests and junk. TSK TSK!  and it was her birthday Sunday..happy birthday..again! Well Im smelly, so Im off...

      Today wasnt much, went grocery shopping, ate alot, and felt sick all day.  Ive been feeling naseua alllllllll day long, and my ear is infected and has also been hurting all day.  Im just a problemed child.  So my mom asked me today if I wanted to get my GED instead, shes asked me before, but i dont want to.  But she was telling me that my home schooling degree may be different then a real diploma.  She said she would get her GED with me, shed never finished High School either.  So now I have all these options, and everyone has its pros and cons.  I could get my home schooling certificate, that ever college may not except, I could get my GED which may not be as good or as excepted as a real diploma, or i could go back to regular high school for my last year, next year.  Each one I want to do, and dont want to do.  So I need some advice, feel free to tell me your opinion.  Right now Im pretty tired...

      The yard sale was pretty good.  It was nice and warm outside, my clock was accidently set on the wrong time, so i woke up at 6, thinking it was 7...i was surprisingly very awake.  Sold all of my old stuff, made a few bucks.  Oh but this old fart comes up to me, and says, "when are you due?".."in august"..then he says "thats 4 months away, what are you carrying twins?" no asshole, and its 3 months away.  He made me mad, hes a guy, guys know nothing, I think Im perfectly fine, if anything I think Im too small. Oh well. So I was pooped, went inside, slept till 4, woke, up went to that party, it was pretty good, but I got restless during the end, and now I am tired as all get out.  Im suppose to be going out with some friends tomorrow for someones birthday, but they havent let me know anything since, and I dont want to miss out :\ oh well, 'night

      Today was...fun.  I woke up, thinking oh jeez, this is one of those Fridays where Im gonna sit around in my PJs all day, but ahha! I was wrong.  Well I woke up, Justine and Elisha washed their car..they were suposse to wash mine too, they even pulled it up and everything, but they freakin' didnt.  They brought Kayla out, and she was all naked and cute and trying to help, but just eating things, she wasnt suposse to eat... So Im just sitting there, and I see I have a missed call and Im like hmmmm, and it was Amber. So I called her back and she said the Pops Concert at Bowie was tonight, so I met her and alot of other people up there...the show was good, i thought last years was better though, but Eliza was soooo cute in thriller, that girl can dance. Anyways, I got to see like everyone I havent seen in like a year, it was fun.  Afterwards we decide to go to Outback, but too long of a wait, so some of us went to Tias, and some others went to Mcdonalds. I ate like a cow, my plate was licked clean. Then I dropped Amber off at Katies and headed home and here I am...awake and bored...     .  Kay :)   . hard to see picture of thriller during pops concert...   . This is babies (Riley) sonogram, its the profile of the face and part of the body :)

Gives me some hope, it was something about how old battles are over and new connections are starting! yayyy.  I really need to do a system recovery on my computer, its so messed up.  Maybe Ill do that tomorrow morning.  I was looking at houses in Couer d' alene (Idaho).  My mom said me and my sister should get a house down there by ourselves instead...I think she doesnt wanna live with us anymore.  I guess it could be fun living with Justine.  Who knows, time for bed...

      Ive been on my feet all day.  me, my sisters and mom went downtown today and went out to lunch, because Crystal couldnt come to the Mothers days dinner.  Kayla made the biggest scene, but I felt bad because I hate it when she crys, but it was embarassing. So anyway, we walked around for a while.  Then we came home, and I decided to go shopping, didnt get any clothes but I got a new duvet cover, it looks alot better than my other one.  And thats about it.  I had a really good dream last night...

      It was one of them days.  Where you sit and do nothing.  I need to go out though and get some books and stuff, but its too late now, everythings probably closed. I figured out how to put pictures in here, they've made it easier, so Ill need to start doing that... I registered at babies r' us today, just to let some people know.  I dont know if Im gonna plan my shower or someones surprising me, I guess i better find out.  The storm last night almost made me pee my pants,  it was hard to get to sleep.  Other than that, the weather has been soooo nice, it makes me happy :)  Tomorrow its suposse to be 86, so maybe ill try tanning, before the Cicadas come. I think my computer is about to die, so I better just stop here...

We made our video to send into "desingers challenge" finally and went to this resturaunt we go to every mothers day.  Its funny because of all the people who i talked to and had the chance to say happy mothers day to me,  the most unlikely person told me, and well my mom told me also but thats it.  Even my friends that I got to talk to today didnt tell me.  Maybe I talk to the wrong kinda people? Anyway, I just finished watching Harry Potter

Oh well, at least i'll get like 15 seconds of fame :)  Crystal had a doctors appoinment, shes about 10-12 weeks behing me, and the doctor said she was pretty sure it was a boy. Finally! A boy in the family, Im glad its her and not me though :) Well since ive been either in pain or sick this week, I need to catch up on some much needed cleaning and neglected sleep...

      I must complain some more.  I dont get to bed till 1:30 last night, just because I can never sleep anymore.  I wake up at 2:30, with the worse, constant lower back ache, I was shivering, and wanting to puke.  I couldnt get my back to stop hurting if my life depended on it, I took a hot bath, it helped releive it somewhat, but the second I got out it started back up,  so I sucked it up, and woke up again at 5:30, it was like a living hell.  My back felt like, it was dieing, so I go downstairs and make some food, and my mom comes out and makes me tea, and then I puke up my food, and I go back upstairs and my mom gave me a hot wash cloth to put on it, and I fell back asleep for another hour or so.  Woke up, still hurts. So I take a bath in my moms bath, it was like heaven,  because its so humungous and has jets :) I got drugged up on extra strength tylonol, but it definitly didnt do much.  Finally call the doctor at around 2:30, than I have to go up there,  My eyes are so swollen, and I just wanted to drop, it was so hard getting ready.  I went there, they said I had a viral infection, but I like to call it death. and this back ache..I dont know how Im gonna sleep tonight, plus this damn sore throat, pounding headache, and sharp tummy pains. If tonights like last night. pfft!  I still have 13 more weeks left, how the hell am I going to do it, this has been the worse pregnancy... ever!I just want to be normal!!!!!  Im done venting :( gooooodnight!

      I woke up with the worse back pain and horrible sore throat. I thought it would go away but it just got worse, sharp pains everywhere, pounding headaches, sore throat, ugghhh.  So I sat in bed all day and watched tv. I felt like I was on my death bed, then my mom gave me a back massage, it felt good at the time, but didnt do much.  So I took some medicine, made some hot tea, and took a warm bath :) And now Im out just in time to watch some good prime time television.  I'll probably fall asleep though because im so, dead...

      Today was the day Ive been dreading for a while.  I had to drink this icky glucose drink, like an hour before my doctors appiontment today, I couldnt drink or eat anything with it or after it either.  It didnt taste that bad, but I still didnt want to do it, because I also had to get my blood drawn after:( A friend of mine also suggested a few middle names to me, and out of them i liked Abigail and Alaina the best, i think it sounds nice, So tell me which one you like best :)...  So my day was dead boring, Ive got some things to do...

      Im having issues with the babys name, i need to freakin figure it out, so give me some advice. I havnet a clue how I want to spell it or what the middle name is going to be, I bought a baby name book, but it hasnt helped much. I dont want something plain, but I dont want something crazy and ugly. I need a professional namer. The first name is definitely riley, but how should i spell it? I was looking at the most common names for 2003, and Riley was number like 59 on the girls list, which worries me, I dont want her to have like some stupid common fad name every other girl in her class has.  : \

      hmm I just found out someone I went to school with died recently. I didnt know him well.  But its just weird.  He was drunk, and he went to the woods to go to the bathroom or something and he went back to the house that he thought was his friends, but it was someone else, and they called the cops, so he got scared and ran away into the forest, went into a river..and drowned. How horrible, drowning. That has to be the worse death. Thats just another reason i hate alchohol.  It makes me sad. :(

      Today was actually good. Me, Justine, Elisha, Crystal, Kayla, Crystals friend Caroline, and her little boy went up to Sandy Point.  I havent been there since I was in 5th grade.  It was such a nice day out, perfect for tanning, and I did get a few shades darker :) My feet turned orange though, and my sandals have an orange tint to them too because of that sand :( Went to Wendys, then dropped off Crystal, than she came back over so she could take a shower, because her bathroom is getting redone.  And when she was dressing Kayla in the new babies room, I was lying down, she freakin smacked me, it hurt too, she doesnt know any better, but still! I dont know how Crystal does it, Kayla is a wild child, way too hyper, hope mine isnt like that... I got up to go downstairs and I notice Custus's big fat self, all sprawled out asleep in the crib, it was pretty funny, because Custus is...a manly man, so I took a picture.  I took some of Kayla too at the beach because her bathing suit is sooo cute, the top is shaped as little hearts, I want one :) Oh, and than I watched the last Swan competition, it was good, I think Rachel did deserve to win, she was my second pick, my first was Cindy, but at least she made the top 3...   .  .  .

      Could the weather suck anymore?  The storm last night scared the heck outta me, i was sleeping and my house was like shaking from the thunder.  So needless to say, the sucky weather = not so good of a weekend.  I watched a movie called In America tonight, it was okay, a few poeople told me that it was good, but to me it was just depressing and a little strange.  I didnt enjoy it that much, it was okay...  There are these statues of two cows by my house, because the Department of Agriculture is there.  And they dress them up like every holiday or whatnot. Im driving past and i see these cows with like hot pink dixie cups on their eyes and these gas mask type things on, and it freaked the heck outta me, it took me a while to figure out what they were dressed up as...    . (they are dressed as Cicades, if you cant tell)

My sisters friend has been in town from Utah, Leah (heh sorry if i spelled your name from leah!), shes going to fix me up with my future husband ;), so i have been hanging around Justine and her friends all week.  And i painted something on the babies wall the past couple of days. I'll leave a picture, im pretty proud of myself, i didnt think it would come out as good as it did, its not perfect, but i like it.  I plan on painting more, but i dont know what yet... I didnt know people actually read this, but a alot people have told me they do. My life isnt that interesting! at all! Now i feel the pressure to do something cool worth writing about!   . my masterpiece ;)

      mmm, i just finshed off a good bagel from dunkin donuts and icecream from maggie moos :)  I feel bad for it though, ive already eaten entirely way too much today.  Ive decided that Riley, will be one of those weird people with two middle names. It will be Riley Jo(after my mom) something Martin. I havent decided what something is yet, I have a few in mind... Ive done pretty much nothing all weekend, except today I went to the pool, I guess ill put up a picture or two.  I have a doctors appoinment tomorrow :( All i do is get weighed, pee in a cup, wait in a room alone for 15 minutes, get checked and go.  Soon ill have to go every week. ick...   My mom goes out of town on Friday, only for a night though, so it doesnt really matter much.  And we are leaving for Montana on the 30th, coming back on the 5th.  My family found a house in Idaho, that we are going to look at while we are in Montana, maybe buy :). I'll post a picture of it also, just because im in love with it :)  . mmm grilled cheese  . me and my sisters :)  . my future home??

      This week flew by.  My God sister Ashlyn, was suposse to he coming to stay with us for a couple weeks tomorrow, but she's coming Friday instead...I really wanted to go out tonight, but it didnt seem like anybody was doing anything.  Maybe tomorrow. I have a feeling this weekend is going to be fun, *knock on wood*, I dont have any plans, but I just feel it. Mainly everyones out of school, and im just really excited its like officially summer. :)  Last night I couldnt get to sleep. I eventually did around 4.  I made out a budget plan for me, for this year. (thats how bored I was!!!). I dont sleep much anymore...  I keep trying to guess when my baby shower is going to be.  Its a suprise so Im not sure when it is.  My family is really bad at hiding stuff. I found the guest list and some other things laying around, but I havent found out the date.  I dont really want know though because I want to be suprised. Yeah I know this entry was boring, but I promise the next one will be exciting :)    "The decision to to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story. It changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender; because this kiss already has within it that surrender" -Emil Ludwig  Just a cute qoute I found in a little mini book of qoutes laying around.

      I dont want to say this week was bad, and I dont want to say it was good, it was just there!  I cant remember much of what I did, i can only remember from Friday on. Im losing my mind! Anyway, on friday, my mom went out of town, so I was like, "yes time to do anything I want!!", but of course, it never turns out that way.  I went over to Mikes, but I left after about an hour or two. So I got home pretty early, and wanted to take advantage of being parentless.  So I texted about half of the people on my phone, only 3 responded (Im so unloved).  Nobody had any good ideas, that I felt like doing. Elisha was over, and of course Justine and him were playing Karaoke Revolution. So I sat around and laughed at them, I actually have a few clips of them, I tried to put them up on a site and than put a link on here, but the videos are too big :( Then we decided to go to Fridays, it was pretty late, but it was packed, I saw a couple people i knew, but I dont think they recognized me...  I think it was actually the night before my mom was playing Karaoke Revolution with Justine and Elisha...oh my! She got booed off the stage in the game, every single time! hehe.  I'd either have to be drunk, or around ALOT of other people that cant sing either, to actually play that game.  Yesterday I went to a show, in Africa a.k.a Dundalk, with Amy.  I was in the car for 3 freakin hours! My elbows were cramping up, I got lost.  I didnt really know where it was to begin with so we were just kinda winging it. My gas tank is basically on E now, and I had a little bit over 3/4's a tank to begin with, but thats okay because gas prices are suposse to be coming down.  Today, turned out to be pretty good. I didnt do anything, I sat around and watched movies all day.  I watched this one movie, I dont know what it was called, it was an older movie, about this camp these kids invent or whatever. Then Chicago came on, I didnt really watch it, then Pirates of the Caribean, didnt watch that either. Then, Poltergeist, Ive never seen it before, so i watched that. Wasnt scary though :(  I lost 2 pounds, because I havent eaten alot in the past couple days, so I tried to eat alot today, but I wasnt very successful. So today was good...for a Sunday. I feel odd not posting a picture on here, because I do every other day, so Ill put one of Kayla, head banging, at least thats what it looks like shes doing...   . silly goose

      oh my      Your Love Life by lpfloatsmyboat      Name/username/nickname:           favorite color:           best physical quaility:    everything!      best personality trait:    outgoing      will you marry your bf/gf that you have now?    it depends      when will you get married?    October 28, 2015      your kiss is:    fiery      People date you because:    you're everything they want in a girl/guy             Created with the ORIGINAL  urlLink  MemeGen  !       Thats a bunch of crap. I'll get married before that..well hopefully :)   I had fun at the beach. I got a nice tan :) A little burn but not too bad. Our hotel was super nice, I was suprised. I cant count how many times I got asked about the baby by alot of random people. This one crazy black guy thought he was psychic, he stopped me while I was walking and said "hey, you know youre going to have a boy, right?", I just gave him the most confused look and walked away. This foreign guy in a shop was like hitting on me, haha, I feel like a big fat ugly whale, so it made me feel good:) And this old guy said I looked like I was gonna pop, I wanted to hit him badly! I think its time to be done being pregnant...  So the first day we got there around 11, we met up with a few other people at the beach near their place.  We were there for about 2 hours, and got hungry, so we went to eat at a resturaunt called Big Peckers. Ive never been there or even heard of it before. But its a really yummy place, the tables there glide back and forth, it was fun. Honestly I cant really remember the day, I dont have a memory anymore. I know we went swimming and went up to the boardwalk and ate and some other good stuff, but i couldnt really tell ya much more. Anyway, since we were under aged, the hotel wouldnt let us have any visitors, and I said only 2 people were staying in a room so I could get it cheaper, but really 4 people were. So we had to walk out in pairs everytime we left, it sucked. The next day we bascially did the same thing, I dont want to write this really drawn out entry so ill leave it at that. I was hoping to do more while I was there, but its only the first visit this year, next time Ill do more.  Today I slept...alot, I was so exhausted. I ate alot too. Since nobody was home, for dinner I made up two hotdogs and baked beans. Then my mom came home with chinese, so I had fried rice and a slice of cheesecake. I have a bottomless put for a stomache:) Unfortunetly I didnt take very many pictures while I was at the ocean. I have a few but I wont even bother posting them...  I added a comment section, so feel free to comment away!!

      my belly definitely grew today. Its so big! Im going to the ocean on Thursday for a couple days.  I dont know if I want to be seen in my bathing suit anymore! Im excited! Im going up with a few old friends and their friends. I found a nice hotel on the boardwalk and I got it for almost half the price it normally is  :) Ive had the most boring week of all time.  I feel bad for Ashlyn, shes probably bored out of her mind. I just havent been in the mood to go out and do anything lately.   I could not stop cleaning today. I cleaned my bathroom for a hour, Ive never seen anything so shiny :) I was still in the mood to clean so i decided to clean my room.  I took a break for an hour or so. and i started to clean the kitchen. Then I cleaned the floors and the windows. I was still in the mood to clean but there was nothing left! I was going to clean my car, but then it started to rain. I think I might clean out my closet tonight. Im obsessed! Anyway, I got a new cell phone yesterday, finally...my old one was so...old.  I   I want to post a picture but I dont think I have anything... I would put one of my belly, but im self conscious! Ill put an old picture up. haha I have this funny picture of somebody from last year. But I wont put it up because they will probably get mad at me, so forget it!

      well I had a long entry written out. My computer is a horrible horrible thing, and it messed it up. So ill just sum it up.  I had a very very very boring weekend. Exccept today, I actually went out, but i didnt do anything that exciting. So i kinda lied about saying I would have something good to write about this weekend : x  But I might be going to the beach on Thrusday for the day or maybe a night with Liza. That should be fun. So next time I promise ill have something worth reading, or I wont write at all!

      I leave for Montana the day after tomorrow (30th), and ill be there until the 5th.  Im bringing my computer with me, so ill still be on :) probably not as often, but most likely in the middle of the day and late at night.  I started packing today because I have alot of stuff I want to do tomorrow, including a doctors appointment :( I always end up over packing, but not this time, especially because im limited on clothes i can actually fit into :)  Anyway, yesterday Kayla came over while Crystal went to a wedding.  I dont think I did anything all day, just sat around, as usual...  We found a little baby bunny hurt on our front lawn so we took it into our garage and fed it but it didnt eat that much.  I think Custus (my cat) might have attacked it, because he was laying next to it when Rick found it.  Well they tried to save it, it couldnt move, something was wrong with its feet.  This morning it died :(  I dont know why, it wasnt bleeding to death or anything. Poor bunny, he was so cute and small :(  Today I played The Sims, ALL day long.  Elisha left hsi PS2 over, so I sat in front of the tv the entire day.  I feel, like sucha bum/loser!  A friend of mine actually called me today but I missed it and didnt see it till late because I was playing, and I hardly ever ever see her.  I could of gone out and did something for a change. grrrr...       :(

      Today I woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Another designer came over today, I didnt like him as much, he likes more modern things, and was trying to tell us that he might want us to increase are budget. Which is ludacris considering the budget is already 35,000. I say eff him.    Since I was feeling like crap, I decided to go shopping :) I got a new comforter for me, and a rug for the babies room, which I have to return because it doesnt match.  I was at Target and one of my friends mom's saw me and started talking. And she accidently let the date of my baby shower slip out :(  Well she said "its the 16th right?" so it might or might not be.  I dont really want to be suprised though!  I came home after buying my things, and decided to go to Ikea because I was bored.  I bought nothing :( I really wanted to get something too, but nothing caught my eye. So I wasted gas and 2 dollars on a cinnamon bun there. I dont know what Im going to do tomorrow, but I know I wont be sitting here. So if you want to do something let me know :) Oh and I STILL havent decided on a middle name, Riley, what? give me some suggestions!

      Well yesterday I didnt do much. I saw Spider Man 2, it was good, i recommend it :) Today I sat around and did absolutely nothing :) One of the designers that is going to be on the show with us, came over today to take measurements and stuff. Then I ate...alot. I mean alot, Ive never eaten so much in my life. I woke up had a bowl of cocoa pebbles, a donout, then I had left over dinner which was this taco bake stuff and a side of some kinda pasta, then I had an apple, then I have about 7 dove bar choclates, then I had an icecream sandwhich, then I had a slice of pizza, then I had a half of a peanut butter sandwhich, then I had wendys, and then another icecream sandwhich. Im sure I had some things in between there, I just cant remember. Tomorrow its back to being healthy, I just had to indulge today :) I also washed my car, right when I was done it started to rain :( But I think it still looks clean. I had massive bugs stuck to it, I had to scrape them off : \ Tomorrow I have to run errands, Im such a procrastinator, I always say that, but I always just end up being to lazy! so if you see me online tomorrow tell me to get off and leave!

      Yay, im home!  I came back yesterday from the annual Montana trip.  It wasnt so bad this year though, usually I want to shoot myself by the end of it.  One thing I did want to shoot though was Elisha. heh.  You know like when you have a friend stay with you for a few days and they just start to annoy the heck out of you. It was kinda like that. Heres the week...  Wednesday- left Maryland at 3, got in Montana at 7, had sucky seats on the plane right next to the bathroom, ick, and this mother and daughter were fighting in front of us, the daughter was yelling at her mom for giving her a bad childhood or whatnot, I was sleeping, but Justine told me about it.  Went to my grandmas house, thats where me, Justine and Elisha stayed. Grandma made some pizzas and my aunt and uncle and cousins came over to see us for a few hours. When we went to unpack our luggage, Elisha's "muscle milk" spilled all over his clothes and in his suit case.  Its this nasty protein shake mix crap, that does absolutely nothing.  Thursday- We all hung out by my grandmas pool all day and then we went to my aunt and uncles new house and had dinner.  Their house is like spectacular. Everytime we go to visit them they have a new house, and they seem to get bigger and bigger everytime...  Friday-We drove up to Idaho, rented a boat and drove around the lake for a few hours.  Went to the real esate agent to check out the home we were interested in, but they took it off the market! It was Elishas 21st birthday, he didnt drink much, hes a girl :P  My grandma is crazy and stuck a big regular candle on top of his cake, hehe.   Saturday- Went to a family reunion, met alot of family I didnt even know existed.  It was raining for the first few hours we were there, which sucked because it was an outdoor event, so it was like 50 people huddled into a garage basically.    Sunday- Did absolutely nothing, it was the fourth of July it was pretty rainy out for most of the day, I didnt bother watching fireworks or anything. Fourth of July usually is one of my favorite holidays, but it was pretty crappy.  Monday-left, had annoying people sit behind me on the plane.  First of all it was this big fat white guy running down the isle whith this big plastic case, hits me with it, doesnt say sorry.  Then hes like gasping for air like hes going to die, and screaming at the top of his lungs. Sits down, gets up about 50 times to go to the bathroom, shakes my seat every single time.  Finally it was over and I got home around 9.  Not such a bad trip, I was pretty busy the whole time so it went by fast.  I got a really nice tan too :O)  The one thing I love about going to Montana is gambling. I know Im not 18, but nobody ever questions you. I played the Keeno machines a couple of times, won a few dollars, nothing to brag about :(  Ill post a few pictures, they always turn blurry when I resize them.  Most of the pictures were taken with a real camera, but I took a few with my digital...    on the lake...i know I have a humungous belly :(      big candle!    My mom and Elisha swimming in Idaho. You can actually see their body parts in the lake, you can even the the bottom of the lake. Try that around here, and you cant see further than like an inch down. And yes Elisha is wearing a life jacket. heh

      I didnt mention last time I wrote that my dad ruined the suprise of my baby shower.  My friends mom told me the wrong date, but my dad sure didnt. But oh well.   Yesterday I went to Katies "going away party". But it was just an excuse for everyone to party. haha. She was just going on vacation... I had fun, I got to hang out with lots of people I havent even seen in a looong time. I also had my doctors appointment, my sonogram wasnt all that spectacular, I didnt even get pictures.  She just kinda wanted to see if she was head down, and if shes A OK..and everything is :)  Today... I helped my mom move around furniture. Then we went shopping for stuff for my baby shower. Got lots of fun things, because the theme is Hawiian-y, since thats the theme or her room. Then me Justine and Elisha went to Ground Round and played some keno. I played 20 bucks, I won back 10, but then i played that 10 and lost it all :( Ill never learn, I have the Monaco gambling gene. I also moved around the furniture in my room yesterday. Im not sure how I feel about it... If you werent invited to my baby shower, and you should of been, or you just want to come. Let me know :)

      I know nothing exciting will happen tomorrow so Ill just write tonight. Ive been busy the last week or so, getting out of the house alot :) Right now my mind is blank and I cant remember what I did yesterday. But today I went to visit my dad. I went shopping downtown there, but everything closed at like 4! so I didnt get anything.  I went to pier one, then went to the mall, but of course when I want to spend money I cant find anything I want to buy.   I watched the Butterfly Effect tonight. It was sooooo good. I wasnt expecting it to be. If you havent seen it, go rent it! Monday, at my doctors appointment I get another sonogram, yay! Only 5 more weeks (hopefully sooner :) ) till baby is here. Im not ready, well  I  am, but I dont have EVERYTHING I need yet. What I'm really missing is a bassinet but I think thats what my mom bought me for my shower gift. If not Ill have to go buy one soon so she can have somewhere to sleep! Ill probably write again after my sonogram and put up the pictures :)

      no baby yet! ive been walking and squatting and doing everything I can, but shes stubborn like her mommy :) Im losing my mind so I cant really tell you what Ive been doing.   Yesterday I went to target to return Crystals gift because I already got one, and I got a high chair and a boppy pillow instead. I bought a few frames too and framed these paper fishies that were decorations at my baby shower and put them in the nursery, they look nice :) Im going to post picture of it because Im so&nbsp;proud of myself, I worked hard on the nursery and I think it looks perdy.&nbsp; I love just sitting in there, i clean it&nbsp;almost everyday.&nbsp; Im still missing some things, its a little empty. And i want to paint some more on the wall.&nbsp;My dad hasnt gotten me my rocker I asked for, 4 months ago... Nothing interesting has happened the past few days so, I wont bore you with random things. Oh yeah, but we are building a patio in our backyard, and they've been working on it for the last week. It looks nice, it should be finished sometime next week, and we are having a bbq, so come if you want :) annnd I need some advice, still havent decided on a middle name, I am between Jo (after my mom) and Brynn. So leave a comment, post annoynomous if you want. Here are the choices  Riley Jo Martin  Riley Brynn Martin  Riley Jo Brynn Martin :)  Pick!!   &nbsp;  pictures!!   &nbsp;

      Today was bad, I just was in a really bad mood. I just feel so humungous and helpless. I cant do anything, It hurts to bend down. I was planning on walking today, because I heard it helps to bring on labor. But I went to the pool, and then I got caught up on writing thank you cards all day. My hand hurts bad :( Tomorrow, Im walking! Anyway, thats pretty much it, I found this interesting thing online. So ill let you read it...    Question 1: If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already, three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?   Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.   Question 2: It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.   Candidate A -  Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists.He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day.   Candidate B -  He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.   Candidate C -  He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.   Which of these candidates would be your Choice?  Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.         Candidate A: is Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Candidate B: is Winston Churchill.  Candidate C: is Adolph Hitler.    And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said yes,you just killed Beethoven.  Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think before judging someone.  Never be afraid to try something new.   Remember:   Amateurs built the Ark   Professionals built the Titanic   Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500  employees and has the following statistics:  * 29 have been accused of spousal abuse  * 7 have been arrested for fraud  * 19 have been accused of writing bad checks  * 117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses  * 3 have done time for assault  * 71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit  * 14 have been arrested on drug-related charges  * 8 have been arrested for shoplifting  * 21 are currently defendants in lawsuits  * 84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year  Can you guess which organization this is?    Give up yet?    It's the 535 members of the United States Congress. The same group of idiots that crank out hundreds of new laws each year designed to keep the rest of us in line.     Ill be honest I picked Hitler and I said yes to the abortion!

       I have a feeling this post is going to be long. If you dont want to read then stop.&nbsp;   Friday,&nbsp;Me and Justine were waiting for Crystal to come over so we could get party favors for the shower.&nbsp; She was taking forever, and since I havent really been able to touch my feet in a while, I decided to use my pedicure gift certificate that Ive had laying around&nbsp;for months.&nbsp; Ive never had a pedicure before so I was really scared that the foreign ladies were gonna try to make conversation with me and I wouldnt be able to understand them, heh.&nbsp; I just grabbed a magazine and read it so that they wouldnt try. I actually had a guy do my feet, he was really grouchy. Anyway, I loved it, my feet looked so pretty afterwards. They still look good but the paint it beginning to chip :(&nbsp; I got some great party favors, that were suprisingly cheap, and then went out to eat and got free dessert :)   Yesterday I went out with a few friends for a couple hours   Today, I had my baby shower! yayyy. It was alot of fun. A pretty good turn out , about 25&nbsp; people.&nbsp; Some people I really wanted to come couldnt make it though :( I got lots of gifts. Im all set now, she can come out! We played this great game where you take like 8-10 diapers, melt candy bars in them (so that it looks like crap), and you pass them around and have to guess what candy bars they are. It was funny too see people sniff and taste them, heh. The decorations were awesome, it looked so perdy. Had Jimmy Buffet playing, of course ;)&nbsp; There was soo much food.&nbsp; If youre hungry, stop by my house and i'll feed you. Im going to be eating little mini turkey sandwhiches for days...&nbsp; I dont have very many pictures,&nbsp; the good ones are on regular film.&nbsp; But I have a few okay ones, ill post more tomorrow or whenever i post next, ill take shots from my video camera, which are better.&nbsp; I dont feel like doing all that work right now though. But thanks everyone who came!   &nbsp;

Im constantly hungry, Ill eat anything if you put something in my face, if you dont put it in my face Ill go and get it! errrrr :( I havent done anything the past couple days, and enjoying it. Ive been running around lately, so its been good to just sit at home all day. They pretty much finished our patio. I dont know how I feel about it, its...okay. I guess it will look better once the landscapers come and fix it up.  They are coming back to finish the steps and I hope they fix their mistakes they made while they are at it.  I feel like we ruined our house with this big massive piece of concrete. : / errr I dont know, I guess because im in my "nesting" phase i feel like everything has to be perfect. I cleaned the doors today for god sake. Im obsessive! I clean every single day. I wrote a whole pragraph on cleaning, but I realized that Im babbling too much so I deleted it : /... I need a deep...long...massage. Thats all I want. I feel like crap, and im in pain, Im thinking about getting one of those maternity massages, but they are pretty pricey. So if you want to offer to give me a massage, it would be greatly appreciated :) Tomorrow its back to "work", have lots of errands I have to run, but I should be finished by night time. hint hint.

      it looks like the vote is for Riley Jo. So its Riley Jo Martin, unless someone has some super spectacular name I havent thought of :)&nbsp;Errr I cant remember what I do anymore, so&nbsp;I guess it wasnt that important, nothing worth writing about. I had&nbsp;my first interal today at the doctors. wooo. hehe, yeah i know, too much information :) My neighbor is mean, she said something rude to me today, that I wont go in to. But I never liked her anyway, we'll see if I ever babysit her kids! Thats about it, its been pretty slow around here lately :/

      Its been way too cold for august outside recently :/ what sucky summer weather. I guess its better than being extremely hot, but i feel weird wearing a jacket in august.  I havent done anything in a while, i need to get out. once more before baby comes. Everyone has bets on when Im going to pop, everday up to the 11th is taken up and the 17th and maybe the 16th i cant remember. If you wanna join, give me 5 dollars and a date :) So far Crystal and Brian lost, and Justine has dibs on tomorrow, Brian called me yesterday pressuring me to go into labor, so he'd win, so i took a walk, but nothing happened. I really wanted to go out tonight, but its getting late and it seems like nobody wants to do anything. Ive been sitting home alone for most the day : \ I have to go out with my dad tomorrow morning, we are finally going to get my rocker. But tomorrow night Im free. Oh I dont think I mentioned that the desingers came over with their plans the other day. 2 of them are really good, but the other one sucks. And that lady was a bitch anyways, she doesnt think before she says stuff, I wanted to hit her a couple times.  The design my mom and Rick picked, is a little out there, but its nice. Its really worth 78,000, but 40,000 is being donated, because its tv and all, so thats nice. I havent posted a picture or anything in a while, so Im gonna take a random picture...    yummy in my tummy :O)

      I know alot has happened, but I dont feel like writing any of it.  The only thing of interest is that the camera crew for that show came today.  They were here at 9, and they took most shots of my mom and rick, then at 4 after my doctors appointment, we had to pretend to be like doing normal stuff around the house together, and they shot that. I know Im gonna look like a total fool, but I dont care. After they were all done with everything, we took the producer out to dinner. Him and the camera guys were really nice :) I had the best mashed potatoes today, jeez they were good, and then I had the best chocolate cake ive ever had. mmmmm! I have good news from my doctors appointment though, she said I wasnt really dialated any, but I was thinning and the baby dropped very low, she said she could feel the head :) I can feel that shes low, when I walk for a long time, it feels like shes gonna fall out. hehe, that wouldnt be good ;) Tomorrow is my moms birthday and we are having a cook out, me and Justine made her a cake...a choclate turtle cake, yummy, but I cooked the caramel wrong, because I suck :( Thats about it, lets hope next time I post its a birth story!!

      I had this really long good post written but it got deleted :( But I found this and I thought it was humorous..   First Three Years... can the English language survive?  "The vast majority of our imports come from outside the country." - George W. Bush    "If we don't succeed, we run the risk of failure." - George W. Bush    "One word sums up probably the responsibility of any Governor, and that one word is 'to be prepared'." - George W. Bush     "I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future." - George W. Bush     "The future will be better tomorrow." - George W.
