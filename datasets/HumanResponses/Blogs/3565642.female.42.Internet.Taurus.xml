      Yeah...almost time to go home...been a long day..time passed fast until after lunch and then real sloooowwww...now gotta spend 2 hours at my desk at wake tech..yawn...Feeling better as 90% of auntie is gone...I am off all the pills and am doing ok...heat tho is making me feel slow..just need to maintain until fri evening then I will be ok...i know I was rather needy this time and I am sorry if that annoyed..I just want to have mama lisa help me get better but can't as mama lisa is sick too..I hope that makes sense..Trying to get rest of semester done so I can concentrate on the other things on my chore list..I want to have a relatively good amount of free time available on July 4th weekend so I can be less stressed...I think I am making slow progress in doing better taking care of myself..Need to exercise more but am eating alot better..more salads and trying to disperse my sugars better but its hard...I also have reading to catch up on..I also am thinking that I may be a little too independent and may need to belong more to things..not sure...but finding places and ppl that would allow me to be me is not easy..right now only I have a short list of those I care for that want and love me as I am..hmmm.well time to go hit traffic...more later..xo

      Hi..am much better now...the worst of the pain is over and I sure glad. I was real loopy last night with the good drugs but had to take more of the muscle relaxers than I prob should have. At one point i felt like i was flying around the room. Another time i was so sad cause i was all alone and in tremendous pain that i guess i had what my mother used to call a pity party...just bashing men cause they don't understand..wanting a hug....but i did have a nice long conversation with myself about it and that helped. I guess i was loud during this conversation as kitty kept looking at me funny..gonna go home at 5p and take care of myself..lay down i guess and just try to feel better. I think it wont be so bad tonight as right now I am not on any pain killers and I feel tired but ok....ok more later...:):)..somtimes being a girl is rough but they say we make up for it with the multiple orgasms we get to have.lololol..xo

      Weekend was too hot on sat but nice on sun..we could open up the windows...Panic/anxiety attack on sun that scared me as I couldn't stop crying...started over a mixture of watching the movie SIGNS, no one available in person or by phone to talk to and couldnt feel the touch of JB on my back (I usually can feel the slightest ghost of a touch on my back when I close my eyes and it has such a warm calming effect..makes me smile big..:):):))so overall felt very alone so crazy lady was able to manifest too well...but was able to pull myself out of it over a period of time by using the breathing technique that JB taught me..It was a true test to see if I had paid attention...Since then I have felt better..more calm...I just don't like the feeling of being so out of control..I think that I am able to control crazy lady better this month...I will and must keep practicing so that I can minimize these happenings...just being a girl is hard sometimes...:)...then of course auntie will be here shortly..just want her to get here so she can go....not in the mood for her...but that could be the pre auntie talking..chuckle...too funny...  I have been doing about 6 hours of research today on game conventions, places and groups to sponsor one of JB's seminars (of which I have some good leads)and some sites and material to help with the PHP/MySQL stuff...Its been real quiet so far today (know on wood...oops got a website to update...can't forget that one...Birthdays coming up...i think I am going to handpaint a card for Loretta for her birthday this year...Not sure what to do for the other july birthday but must keep it on the down low...ok got work to do....then later on I can watch part 2 of Salems lot on tbs...it was quite good for part one...more later..xoxoxo

      Ok..why do the men in my local vicinity all become are stubborn and hardheaded when it come to the person they love. I do understand the frustrations they talk about but where does the objectivity go...It doesn't disappear, I know it doesn't...sigh...i try to help...doesn't seem to work...So now my hands are throbbing with pain from so much typing in IM to help them...My anxiety is there...trying to breathe...slow progress...more later...need to let my head pop off my shoulders and run around the room...maybe..:)

      I am better...took me until 9pm to be able to breathe and be somewhat calm...watch Pirates of the Caribbean and that took me away which helped alot...:)..crazy lady simmering but not taking over...just got to remember that I am going to have waves of up and down when she is here...trying hard to make sure she doesn't take over like before...i can do it...Chris might be going to see a friend in Greenville...that wouldbe good for him to get away..He is stressing over his friend in the mountains and stressing over school...He needs a break...Then that means I would have a weekend alone..it would be nice and quiet but would rather have company....:)

      Sigh...why do some ppl have to be so hardheaded and stubborn that they just blow things out of porportion and then give up when it gets hard in relationships..I am trying to help someone and all they want to fixate on is the bad (or the perceived bad) and then proceed to replay the same mistakes as in other relationships..I try to help and all I do is stress and make myself ill and frustrated...And feeling the twinges of crazy lady is just making me feel like i want to crawl away into the dark and stay there..I would rather crawl into some warm friendly arms but too far away...sigh...I am trying to breathe but not working too well as the knots in my throat and stomach are forcing all my energy out...I know there is nothing I can do to help other than to be there..its just.....sigh....almost time for lunch...maybe sitting in the trees outside can help...maybe to cry would help..not sure as this feels like one of those times where if i start i may not be able to stop....hmmmm...more later...

      Harry Potter was so good. The special effects and the story were different than the first 2 but still were excellent. I really would like to see it again...Now I can't wait for Shrek 2 and Van Helsing then I think I will be caught up with the movies for the moment at Least until July 7th when the King Arthur movie comes out.. I also need to see the 3rd movie of the Matrix series and the 3rd LOTR movie too. I would just rather see them with someone tho..I just don't enjoy it as much when I go by myself...not sure why as I like watching movies on tv fine by myself ok..but its always better with a friend....interesting...more later...:):):)

      Hi..if you want me to call you but you are not a phone that is able to dial long distance free (like work)then you can go from any computer to the following URL -  http://www.mobile.att.net/messagecenter/  Then put in my cell phone number (area code and phone), your name and your message. I keep the phone on all the time so I will get it and call you right away or when your message says to call. You, Matthew and Chris are the only ones who know the number so I won't be surprised to hear from you.  This is in case you need me during the day and say you want me to call work..or something like that. This is just another tool that is part of my cell phone.

      HI,  Well first I have to apologize, as I was not thinking on the same time frame that you were when we were talking about classes.  When I am in a semester, I am always thinking ahead to the next one. So I thought you were referring to Fall Semester. You see summer semester started just after my birthday last month and ends at middle of July. So the class you were looking at was for the summer schedule that is already running and you cannot get into once the semester has started.    I thought you were referring to Fall Semester, which starts August 17th and runs until mid December (16 weeks). That’s what I was referring to when I said your application had to be in as soon as you could because registration for fall starts June 22nd.  Now if you are still interested in taking the class. It is ITN 170.( I am planning on taking it as one of the free classes I get to take)..Here is the link for all the classes taught in the Fall 2004 semester that are completely taught on the web.  http://www.waketech.edu/curred/schedules/fall/web.html  This link gives you details into what being a special student is  http://www.waketech.edu/admissions/specialstudent.htm  This is the link for the application   http://www.wake.tec.nc.us/admapp02.pdf  You will want to add a Program name and code to your application of INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES - A25290 as this means you declare a major and can register for classes much easier each time as well as earlier.  Here is the link for the Internet Tech Program for you to see. I know you are not going to want to do another degree but to see what variety we offer so that you can see if any other classes might help.  http://www.waketech.edu/catalog/associates/internet.html  Ok now that I have given you all the details..think on what you want to do...If you want to take a online class thru another venue then I do know of others.. I can give you more options after I do research. All of these options cost about the same. I can only tell you about the ITN class as I know the instructor..Chris has also taken the class and he can also tell you about it.  NOW another option is that you can borrow for the summer the textbook that is used in the ITN 170 class. It is not one that you have or at least I don't think so. Here is the link to the description on Amazon.   http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672323494/qid=1087235078/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/102-4593642-9514530?v=glance&s=books&n=507846  It is dedicated to just MySQL. I believe it is more detailed that the combo book you have. I have a similar book from same publisher that is just PHP that you can borrow too. (this one is mine so you can have longer). Here is the link to a description on Amazon for it.   http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672326191/qid=1087235533/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-4593642-9514530?v=glance&s=books&n=507846  I can also get copies of other books by being a instructor so if there are other books that might help then give me the ISBN, title and the publisher.   Ok I am sure your mind is buzzing aware and you might be getting a headache…:)  I will publish this on my blog so that you could look at this at lunch maybe..  I don’t remember exactly what you said you needed to know how to do ( I think it was using a command line to get it to work) but if you write me back the specifics and I research this for you as I am VERY good at that  (be as detailed as you can, like you are talking to someone who has no idea of what you know, even though I do)

      WEll morning...delayed in entering my blog this morning as there seems to be a steady stream of stuff for me to do..Its like everyone in the office is trying to keep me busy..too funny...I have been proof reading documents, reworking old files to excel as well as my faxing in and out and doing mail...not too bad really just steady..I have caught myself not breathing right so I change my pattern and I feel calm...Helps with my stress, I can see that affect right now...I am noticing some of my triggers too...one is a person here at NCSU who is sweet but when she come up to me she is so intense it spills over...So I caught myself in the bad habit and moved to the better one..This process is eye opening and interesting....no answer yet from my uncle on the website..I thought I would hear something by now as I want to get started as they want the site up by end of July for live viewing...Matthew cut all his hair short and he looks soo good...It actually caught me off guard but I very much like it and it takes years off for him....I think he like how surprised I was. I knew he was gonna do it but not when..well time for lunch...Wake Tech stuff will be in next message...:):)

      Ok..what is the deal with time slowing down the last 2 hours on a friday afternoon when I want to go home especially to day as I have several errands to do so I can go out of town..This morning flew by and was hectic and now since 2p its like a slowwwww drag...I just don't understand this....Plus why don't ppl get a clue that you are not going to get any business done on a friday afternoon..This office starts to clear out at 3p so why get huffy with me...Its funny how the ppl who call think I can magically fix things if the buyer is not here...Please...I would touch those questions unless I was making the money they do...well time for errands....:):)

      Ok....Its been a freaking day..actually a freaking cranky ass week...Dang what is up with everything and everyone being so damm cranky and ill especially today...first the toner goes out and the fax machine breaks so that when I ask to callt o get it fixed I was YELLED at why I didn't doit sooner..I then reminded this person I was told to wait as long as I could to fix and replace the supplies as the fiscal year is getting ready to end....then I got a apology but my stress level has been so damm high all day cause of this...then the fax guy tells me the machine need to be taken to the shop and he will bring a loaner in the morning...which is fine as it is a slow fax day but everyone in the office is freaking out like oh my god we can't live if the fax machine is out..Then I am not a bookeeper but they have me doing the reconcilations which of course we dont have invoices for half the stuff..Been driving me crazy too...I think half of this office is PMSing all at the same time...good thing we dont ahve any shot guns or they might get used..lololol....Then chris is blowing issues with his friend out of porportion so I have had to have several long talks with him to day to help him see things clearer...I think I helped but he is such a doomsayer sometimes...I try to tell him my mantra of live in the moment but I don't think he hears me when he listens sometimes....ok now I got to go to WTCC and I am so not in the mood but you gotta do what ya gotta do...sigh....I am soooooooooooooooooooo glad I am leaving town for the weekend...even if all I do is a whole lot of nothing then that would be awesome...I didn't say a whole lot of boring cause going out of town is NEVER boring just real real NICE..:):):):):)  Well what would life be without a few bumps in the road.....small really little ones pleases...:):)

I forget that I have messed up the cartilage in the shoulder joint until it starts hurting and aching....such a DUHHH...Slept well even though went to bed late...But I was not as stressed as I was earlier this week so maybe that helped....I do need to find a creative outlet tho...Crocheting is not doing it for me as a outlet...I have these real nice yarns now to work with but I am losing my ooomph...maybe its just cause I have too much to do...not sure...Had thought of trying to make a blanket for myselft or a shawl for myself with all the pretty colors...not sure...a ponch would be cool tho but I would have to modify a shawl pattern and not in the mood to go to that effort right now...Yeah gonna have a nice weekend.....teehee...teehee....more on that later...lololol....no real tangent this morning.....just in a nice mood as I slept well and had a nice phone call last night..:):)...I am sure I will find a tangent later on... :)

      Well the doctors office called with my blood test results...My thryoid levels are normal which is good as that could aggravate my hormone levels.. My cholesterol is really good at 174..I am stoked on that as the men in my family are having issues with high cholesterol and heart disease. Blood pressure and heart rate at normal not high normal as I thought..BUT blood sugar high..at 309 and should be at 110 and that was a fasting blood sugar reading...gonna have to go to doctor to get that fixed but cant go until after july 1 when my insurance changes so gonna have to be better about what I eat until I see the doctor..Sigh...I know its not bad but if I want to be able to manage it with diet and exercise then I am going to have to be better at it..The hard part for me is doing it alone...I give up too easily...but I have to remember to try to be healty so I can be here past my 50th birthday as that is one of my big fears...Its so confusing as there is one way of eating for the American Diabetes Assoc, one for the American Heart Assoc and then the low carb high protein way...too confusing..i just want a easy way to do it...straight forward and to the point..well got some reading and research to do...good thing I like to do that kind of stuff...lolol.....The only test result left to get is a the one to see if my cervix is ok with no abnormal cells. but that takes a week I beleive...hmmm..need to find my blood sugar machine...i know I saw it when I cleaned but goodness knows where it is now...

      Yawn....Its this time of day that I would dearly love to take a nap...Trying to start the day off good. Was a good girl and had my soy milk for breakfast as well as my yogurt then my peanut butter. I have to switch to a peanutbutter with no sugar in it  and thats gonna be hard. Maybe switch back to oatmeal for breakfast...Want to try vanilla soy milk now to see if I can handle that with cereal...But its weird that I have found a brand of soy milk that tastes good - silk brand - 2.99 a carton which is ok. I even got chris to drink some...the chocolate soy milk that is.;.and thats a true accomplishment. I just have to go shopping like a european does. Only buy what you need for that day or the next..Told NCSU that I would only continue to work for them until end of sept cause my stress level is getting higher and I need to do better. I think I made a start in the doctors office yesterday. I had to wait so long between each room I went to and didnt bring anything to read with me that I said what the hell and I sat straight and meditated. It was hard at first cause I am not sure if I am doing the breathing techniques that JB taughtme in the right way. But it got easier and I became calmer. I realized that I may want to go back to the Kadampa center on Mon evenings , like I used to, for the meditation and buddhism class they have. I know there are other classes available at other places but money is a issue since I have to pay so much out for my health insurance deductable. Part of me thinks I just need a neutral, calm and protected environment where I can concentrate and destress my mind...Plus going to bed at 11:30pm last night helped even tho kitty wanted to snuggle against my head for a hour before I could sleep...:):)...no how and when can I increase my creative outlets...crocheting is not doing it anymore...I want to draw more...but no art classes in my price range available right now....have to wait until fall....plus i need to finish up and get my BA....then I can get my masters in 1 year and then move on to other opportunities in teaching...I can really tell that WTCC is hitting my last nerve more and more.. well more later...:):)

      Well went to the doctor this morning. Things are not as bad as I had stressed over but I did get scolded for not taking care of myself better. I have to go to a primary care doc now to get my blood sugar in check as I am not doing the best with the diet and exercise thing. But I have to keep trying. I just don't want to have to take any medicine as it didn't help me last time. I was told that the best thing I could have done for myself was to lose weight. I am now at 219 1/2 which from 300 of 3 years ago is awesome...That in itself made me smile. I do have to eat yogurt (no high fructose corn syrup) and soy every day from now on. I just have to find a way for soy to taste better..I am not at risk for ovarian cancer as I thought but I do have to keep my cycle regular so that I am not at risk for uterine cancer. I am not ovulating it seems (or not much), so not sure how that makes me feel yet. Its like I go up and down this rolloercoaster thing about having kids. I am the motherly type (remember Mama Lisa) but I am not where I would want to be in charge of a child all the time. So I am sad about it but not..not sure if you will understand..But I am going on birth control pills to help regulate my hormones. But the best part about taking them will the crazy lady will disappear..WHOO HOOO..I am so happy about that. So alot of my fears have diminished but I have to take better care of myself. I need to make a food chart of what I can eat and use it also to shop from. Chris wants to go low carb so that is helpful..just no fast food and home cooking...soda is gonna be the hard thing to kick...can have alot of juice...BUT hey this is the time to get better and take care of myself...no one will want to share themselves with me if I don't take care of myself first...more later....  :):)

      Sigh...am I doing too much working 2 jobs?..I like the money but this place (NCSU) is getting as bad as WTCC with the politics and BS..I usually enjoy being here cause I can be a social butterfly but when I feel more annoyed than anything then is it time to go?...I want to be able to concentrate on being a artist somehow..I want to be able to enjoy life and not feel like I need a nap at the end of a day...BUT if I go back to one job (WTCC) then I am afraid of being a sloth who slept all day before Feb....I want to do more webwork...Especially the advice column...What keeps me so afraid of leaping sometimes..I am envious of what JB is doing even tho he is very busy..It seems he is not afraid to try..why can't I??..Not feeling sad just more questioning....Also worried over going to the doctor..some of it is what they will tell me and that i will get scolded..I know I haven't been the greatest about taking care of myself...but I have more incentive now..mainly for me..losing another 1/2 inch to my hips is a nice incentive..I can actually fit into a 2x now..which means in the last 3 years I have gone from a high 4x to a low 2x which is actually is 5 dress sizes...I actually bought a slinky outfit for the first time in 15 years as a treat to myself instead of rewarding with food..am proud of myself...plus I think I look good in my red/fuscia slinky outfit...heeheehee....Making efforts to eat better is helping me, I can tell...when I relapse and eat alot of carbs I feel bad and that feeling lasts in my mind so I can have some incentive not to next time...Adding soy to my diet too but still can't enjoy the taste as is but good if I add to tea...gonna try to find other ways to eay more soy but its hard....sigh....just need more exercise....hard when my back hurts...need to go to a chiro but I am so mistrustful when it comes to my back....except for one person who rubs my back until I literally purr...mmmmmmmmmmm..closing my eyes and thinking of that just now is helping me relax...mmmmmmmmmmm...there are times when a hug, even a quick one, makes it all better.. :):):)

      Stress and anxiety seem to be close friends to me these days. I worry/stress over things that I shouldn't spend so much time over. Then when I have a situation that I should be concerned over then I make myself truly ill. I just want to have life happy. But that is my way of saying I don't want any confrontations. I can truly thank my father for that part of me. I have 2 people I care about who are having problems intheir relationship. They love and care for each other very much but frustration is causing problems in their relationship. I try to help..I try to be I guess what you call the devils advocate to help then see from other perspectives but sometimes selfishness gets in the way...The mama lisa in me wants to scoop them up and make it all better but this is one of those times where I can't..I know I have to wait it out and help where I can...I also need to watch how I use Mama Lisa with others especially if they don't understand where she comes from.

      Good Morning,  This will be weird for me at first as I am not sure how I want to write these entries. My intention is to write them as I feel like so I don't bombard those I love with too many emails. I know that adds stress. But I think I also want to put down the thoughts in my head or tangents so I can share. Then I think I will also put websites or items of interest that I find that I want to keep and share.  Here is a poem that I found that has touched my heart and applies to two very special men in my life:   A Special Friend   Sometimes in life, we all find a special friend;  Someone who changes our life just by being part of it. Someone who makes us laugh until we can't stop;  Someone who makes us believe that there really is good in the world.  Someone who convinces us that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for us to open it.   This is Forever Friendship.   When we are down, and the world seems dark and empty, our forever friend lifts us up in spirit and makes that dark and empty world suddenly seem bright and full.  Our forever friend gets us through the hard times, the sad times, and the confused times. If we turn and walk away, our forever friend follows.  If we get lost in the dark, our forever friend finds us to cheer us up.  Our forever friend holds our hand and tells us that everything is going to be okay. And if we find such a friend, we feel happy and complete, because we need not worry.   U have a forever friend in me, I have a forever friend in U, we have a forever friend in each other because our friendship will last foreverand forever has no end.

      The intention of this blog is for me to be able to put down all the thoughts and ideas I want to express that float in my brain.
