      hmm... teacher's day celebrations today.. quite fun actually... the teachers put up a really lame show.. haha... then had that roundtable discussion with that guy from us, which ended up with me being late (AGAIN!!!) for the movie... i'm always late. haha... but lxg was fun.. mrs naidu got like, the coolest seats, and it was in cine, which is like my favourite theatre.... the seats there are sooo comfy, i could nearly fall asleep.. and the cinemas are not very small, just nice. =)... lol... halfway through the show my stomach was rumbling like mad, and then later on i nearly fell asleep. not because the show was boring, nah. i was just really tired...   i dunno what's gonna happen to odac.... but i really think we can pull this off. if only they believed in that... i worry about our future. kt and pc can be a bit.. particular... and temperamental. i dont hold it against them tho. we HAVE been messing up quite a large bit. sigh. just feel so tired and exhausted from this. ah well.   argh. cikgu wants us to do stock-taking. i havent done stock-taking for odac either. =(. and all the work that we have lined up.   i've got started on HOL homework. hp analysis class. reading through the names. lol. and i've sent in my tryout as cheerleader (?!). just thought i'd give it a go. *bites nails*.   oh btw. bala loved our class present: the bala book of abc. heh.   tricks played on teachers have ended sadly. but one thing's for sure, they will never forget our class. heh. and now they stand like, 1m away from the boards, or at least give it a little check before the lesson starts. lol. *oh and i freaked ms ting out coz she didnt realise i was crouching behind the lower cupboard, and she opened it to check the OHP wires or see if anyone was in there or smth. haha. *

      arrrgghhhh!!! i left my chem notes in school!!! and it's not in the classrooms where it would be damn safe, not in the lockers where it would be pretty safe (we never lock them)... but they're in the FOYER!! how irritating is THAT? i hope i dont lose them... cos if i do then that's my whole section on acids bases and salts, redox and qa all GONE. *prays hard for them to either still  be there or at least returned to her*  anw... our class has been playing tricks on our teachers as little 'presents' leading up to teachers' day.. lol.. it's quite amusing, like each teacher has a different response. naidu was freaked out, bala tried keeping wenyi in and she was laughing her head off and ms neo was sooo suspicious of us and everything, she actually managed to guess what we were up to, but it was still funny all the same. =).   hmm... looks like the tch guy who takes the train in the morning (and afternoons) rides a bicycle to the station everyday... now, how FUNKY is that? *i  would  do the same thing, only problem is that my mom wont lemme chain a bike there and it looks odd to cycle one while wearing a pinafore anw... lol....

      oh dear.... sneezing my head off today... it's all thanks to some person who decided to cook lots of curry (im not against any of that, really) and in doing so triggered off my ultra-sensitive nose which caused me to start sneezing as violently as  *achoo* I-*achoo* Wh-*achoo* - at *achoo*, (smth like that) for around 15 minutes. I couldnt even say hello or wave to my aunt and uncle who stepped through the door. ah well. and now, i have a very blocked runny nose and i can STILL smell the curry tho its a much lighter scent now. My aunt didnt even smell it just now! =(. ah well. just got to make do with whatever nose god gives me. lol.   went roller-blading with the odac ppl today.. it was an un-official thing, so like only 5 people turned up... but it was very fun. =). I had insisted on bringing my own blades to east coast, and my mom was trying to persuade me not to, since like i had to go back to school and all after that. but i didnt really care... so i dragged my blades all the way there, to school and all the way home... now, the thing is right, my blades are the older version... you cant clip them nicely with that clip-strap thingy and sling it around or on your shoulders or something. so my mom, being ultimately worried about my back and carrying my blades in a bag or something, made me carry them in my hiking haversack, which resulted in me looking as if i was going hitchhiking or something. quite amusing. everyone at dk were asking me if i was about to fall over backward with my bag strapped to skinny old me. lol. yep.. anw blading wasfun, apart from me falling over twice because i just cant get the hang of going down slopes. *blush*

      i know i said i wouldnt blog, but i just want to say some stuff. this is a pretty personal entry. it was going to get emotional, but i'm exhausted by all that i was going through, and i dont have the energy to repeat it again. it's not like it comes out right anyway.   tomorrow im gonna tell the class. im just thinking... WHEN. i dont know what they'll think, i dont really want to care. i just feel i should tell them myself, and so i will.   today i realised that i never really loved my parents enough. love was always a weird concept to me... i dunno who i love, whether i really truly love them, or whether it's just i felt bound to relation or something. but today, i really think. my parents are deserving people. i mean, they have their faults, and they're paranoid like any other parents are... the only thing they didnt deserve was this.   my parents think it's stress. the school thinks its peer pressure. i think it's just that i have stinking moral values, and a non-existant moral compass. i need to know what i really want, and what i really draw the line at. i've been too impulsive, too easy influence. i have a streak of pride and independence that i've always prided myself on, and this time, it got mixed up, and it went wrong. i've decided on one thing. if i'm ever going to do anything, i want to know that i can live with my decision from now on. i'll try not to do things on impulse, and exercise self-control. lol. u know what? i sound like those politically perfect people whom i've always loathed. nowadays everything i do, i end up questioning myself, and everything i see, hear, experience, i see it in a new perspective, and somehow, it relates back to what i have done and how i feel. now i know how they feel, and i wonder if they feel the same.  i've been quiet and different, i know, but this i do because i feel wobbly, unstable, unright, and i think i need to get back again, find who i am before i dare say that's me. im constantly questioning myself, and im trying to lie back and just... see first. i dunno. dont ask.   i think god must love me a lot, to make me learn the hard way. if i wasnt loved, i dont think i would have been caught, and then it would have just led to more and more, and the basic degeneration of my soul (not that it isnt polluted already). i have sinned much, not only in terms of this and it has made me wake up, realise my mistakes and it made me think. i was looking at izzy's qoutes (she has a lot! =]) and i came across this one by thorton wilder. it struck me.  "When god loves a creature, he wants the creature to know the highest happiness and the deepest misery. He wants them to know all being alive can bring."  i dont think i've fully understood the meaning of being alive, but i hope that i can be a better person religiously.   on another note, i have the best friends any gurl could have. some of them dont understand, but i know they care anyway. and i'm touched. really. i love y'all [u know who u are! =P]. and that's the best compliment u guys can receive, because i've never really told someone i loved them, and really meant it before. and i mean it this time. =)   now i'm on an official and proper hiatus until after exams. damn the papers.

      aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhh. waiting for the past hour. where have you been????? grrrrr.   terrified. major time terrified.   I'll be on blogging hiatus till after exams. To anyone who actually comes here (apart from jean =P), that'll be about mid next month. Dont miss me too much. *yeah right* lol.   New TV came today. It's nice. I wanna take part in FEAR FACTOR. To do all that high-pumping stuff. Just, just help me get rid of my problems for that moment, do the stuff and live off the adrenaline for awhile. Like a sort of drug that i need.   Before I go, clean forgot about this.... was reminded when i went to visit eu's blog. And again, it's freaking correct, though it's missing some things.   Your Existing Situation Unable to exert the efforts to achieve her objectives. Feels neglected, desiring greater security, warm affection, and fewer problems.  Your Stress Sources Delights in the tasteful, the gracious, and the sensitive, but maintains her attitude of critical appraisal and refuses to be swept off her feet unless genuineness and integrity can be absolutely vouched for. Therefore keeps a strict and watchful control on her emotional relationships as she must know exactly where she stands. Demands complete sincerity as a protection against her own tendency to be too trusting.  Your Restrained Characteristics The situation is preventing her from establishing herself, but she feels she must make the best of things as they are.Wants to broaden her fields of activity and insists that her hopes and ideas are realistic. Distressed by the fear that she may be prevented from doing what she wants; needs both peaceful conditions and quiet reassurance to restore her confidence.  Your Desired Objective Urgently in need of rest, relaxation, peace, and affectionate understanding. Feels she has been treated with a lack of consideration and is upset and agitated as a result. Regards her situation as intolerable as long as her requirements are not complied with.  Your Actual Problem Needs to protect herself against her tendency to be too trusting, as she finds it is liable to be misunderstood or exploited by others. Is therefore seeking a relationship providing peaceful and understanding intimacy, and in which each knows exactly where the other stands.

       "Everyone's got to face down the demons..."  by Third eye blind   this is a weird blog entry... a pretty depressing one that is still stuck somewhere between my heart, my brain and my fingers. everything was about to come out, but it got stuck as i switched on the com, opened the blogger browser and tried to type. whoever who wants to read this, read it at your own risk, dont ask any questions and if you're confused, i give you my sympathies. I'm not very clear-headed myself.    i've been a bit in a weird mood recently... all sorts of mood swings, from the highest of highests, the stoned to the lowest pits around. I suppose part of it is due to my hormones, and if any one of you were caught in it, i apologise. i'll try not to let it happen again.   i feel like i'm making a confession, but i'm not. i dont think it is. i'm not ready for one. the wound has healed, and everyone's been picking at the scab. it wont heal yet. not for a while.   i have a bad habit. i act on impulse, i say things on impulse. i suppose it's great in a way... i'm spontaneous, wacky, and definitely mad. but 3/4 of what i've done on impulse i've regreted. and one i regret every single day. it's something that i must stop, something i must control, curb. it's already made me regret so many times, and it's ruining my life.   i dunno why, but i broke down yesterday, and i did it again today. it's the stupid hormones.   sometimes i really really really want one. someone. anyone.   i'm always depressed when i come out of the shower. all that free uninterrupted time in there, me all alone with only my thoughts... it tends to do stuff to your brain, wreck your emotions. it intensifies everything. so if i seem highly depressed on my blog entry, it's probably because i just came out of the shower.    I feel better now. lol.

      i don't know why i bother... i know i shouldnt. i really shouldnt. i've gone past that point. told myself that i didnt need to, shouldnt have to anymore. why bother? i'm above all this. i can move on, it wll come at its proper time and place. i know i shouldnt pine for it, shouldnt bother looking for it, shouldnt bother trying anymore. it's not like it will come now. who will it come from? no one. not yet. i should wait patiently. concentrate on other things. damn it. i will not lower myself anymore.          when pauline chia said that growing up equalled loneliness, boy was she right. damn right.

      I suddenly want a robbie williams cd... one of his older ones... especially sing when you're winning.. or even swing when you're winning.. i kinda like his stuff.... and it's been so long since i've gotten a cd... lol... been downloading all this while... maybe i'll think about getting one after the exams... if the money doesnt mostly go towards celebrating and watching the movies. heh. hm... come to think of it, i wouldnt mind a santana cd either.. lol...   I promise myself that i will work hard this year and do well for my exams... at least a whole ton better than my previous ones... just need to work on my procrastination and my lazyness.. *grr*... its so freaking irritating.   my mom's right i think... i have too many friends. like my dad. okay, so not really friends. more acquaintances. it's like almost everywhere my dad goes, he's bound to bump into someone.. and i think i follow him in that way... it's like sometimes when i go out, i'm so doomed to bump into someone i know, or used to know or smth... and it happens more when i'm out with someone... sometimes it's total *grr*, esp when i cant remember who the hell the person is... (thanks to my lousy memory)... can never really match face with name... i recognise faces much better than remembering names.. and the situation is always the other person going "hey, atiqah!" and i'm like "hey!".. we shake hands or like gesture or smth.. and im like "so, hows you?" while trying frantically to remember where i know the person from and who the hell it is... sometimes i even walk off still wondering who it was... and thus through all of this, i have actually managed to perfect the art of faking to know the person, when i cant place my finger on who it was... it's not very nice i know, but it's the most polite thing i can think of without blatantly showing my ignorance... =(..   HOL homework is all done except for my hp analysis extra credit and my house elves 101 homework... i must remember to email the prof about using another recipe instead.. hmm... woohooo... prof laffy gave me full points for my handwriting hw. grins. heheh.   there are some things that some people just will never understand... i guess i shouldnt hold it against them, it's just they've always been brought up that way and just that their brains are sorta wired that way i suppose... some try, but fail miserably, and being on the receiving end i kinda realise how it must feel for people who are in the same position as i am... and i think im getting better at trying to help because i now understand... and now i know who i want to go to when i need to tell someone... and who NOT to go to... no offence to them.. they're great friends, wonderful people... but they'll just never understand... speaking of which, i love my odac batch... they took it without any questions, whether or not they understood, and some of them understood it so much better than anyone else i know.... and i'm very grateful for them for that.

      One of my most loved songs.... very simple, vocal and meaningful.... it has a tight hold on my heart.    Better man by Robbie Williams    Send someone to love me, I need to rest and all, Keep me safe from harm, from pouring rain Gimme endless summer, lord i feel the cold  Feel I'm getting old, before my time As my soul feels the shame, I will grow, through this pain. Lord I'm doing all I can to be a better man...   Go easy on my conscience cos it's not my fault I know I've been taught, to take the blame Rest assure my angels will catch my tears Walk me out again, I'm in pain. As my soul feels the shame. I will grow through this pain Lord I'm doing all I can to be a better man  Once you're found that lover you're homeward bound,  Love is all round, love is all around. I know somewhere forlorn on stony ground Love is all around..... Send someone to love me, I need to rest and all, Keep me safe from harm, from pouring rain Gimme endless summer, lord i feel the cold Feel I'm getting old, before my time As my soul feels the shame, I will grow, through this pain. Lord I'm doing all I can to be a better man...

      No jean. You certainly shouldn't check it out. Who knows, it could be all FAKE! *gasp*  haha... =P   Looks like it'll be a busy busy month for me. Got ODAC people to prepare for camp, got house meeting what nots, got Perbayu and ODAC store to stocktake, the dreaded MT O-levels, puasa, and hari raya. haha. The house-cleaning! *shiver* and some other stuff which i cant remember what.... hmm.. nevermind, got it written down somewhere.....   i always have talks with certain people... and i wonder how it helps me and how it helps the person, cos like, in the end i didnt help the person to think of a solution (i think i make it worse), and i dont really help myself either, because i'm just reirterating all i've thought about before. and i end up feeling like i just messed up, rather than help in any way. all i did was waste time, which is what i love doing anyway isnt it? =P   watching movies is fun. release into this fake dreamy world where anything can happen and where u can be a different character.   i crave freedom. not that my parents are evil ppl and keep me hoarded in my room or anything, but i really crave being out there on my own. an adventure. i want to go overseas to study. i dont care. i'm gonna work my ass off to get a scholarship so i can go out there and explore. god help me.

      Sometimes I think I just don't really fit anywhere much.... Maybe the weird quiz was right. I'm a loner goth kid. Like Izzy said, "Looks like we'll have to get you black lipstick for your birthday now.... "  I  like  the new Nokia 3300 handphone. It's like a nice reliable, cool, user-friendly handphone with a radio and mp3 player built in. I can play all my rock tracks and carry them with me, without having to burn it all into a CD! *grins*. Of course, I would probably DIE before I can get my hands on one, firstly I dont have the money, and secondly, my parents would never get me a phone like  that , especially when my old one is working just fine. Not that I'm complaining about my ever trusty and been-everywhere-with-me 3310 model. I like it. It's really been everywhere with me. Up mountains, across seas (heh, so maybe no THAT far), but it's just, you know, the new one is improved. haha. Of course, after reading the reviews and stuff about the phone, you sort of change your mind..... lol.

      Some people are just damn typical and horribly egoistic. I shall not comment further.   Exam results were both great and terrible at the same time. One A1, three A2s, one B4, one C5, two C6s, one D7 and one F9 (it was amath). And DONT tell me how easy the papers were or whatever bullshit, because I already feel bad enough. Current L1R5 stands at 17 because I have to take a math subject into consideration. I'm like, damn unhappy about certain things because I KNOW I could have done better (it sounds cliche I know), but I'm estatic about others because I'm happy the effort I put in paid off. As Cikgu would say, "Ini semua kenyataan." which means something along the lines of "It's all fated." So fate it will be. Now just got Malay Os to hurdle over, and I'm going to work hard for that because I realised (a little too late), that working hard pretty much makes it usually, though not all the time.   And I cant stand ppl who are smart and rant on and on about how lousy they did when others did much worse. I mean, if you think it's bad, I have nothing against that, but shut up can? Go rant somewhere else, or around other ppl who think the same way. Grr.   I feel quite sick, and very tired, and I dont think this weariness will ease off anytime soon. I need to do some exercise. Get more endorphins into the system. Need it man. Quite sick and tired of everything already, just... need something to charge me up, make me happy and excited again, make the days less draggy and much much much more bearable. Everyones so charged up and ready to go, and actually DOING stuff, and what about me? Baahhhh.   Stole this from Jeanine and Eu. lol.

      technically i should be drinking a nice steaming mug of hot tea to calm my nose down a bit, but i'm drinking a cold drink instead, =X. Okay, okay, have put the kettle to boil. Will drink hot tea later.   Anyway, this morning was beautiful. As in seriously. I don't know if it's the after-effect of watching American Beauty, but anyway, I woke up at 5.20 this morning. I sort of got woken up by a thunderclap, but it was really, really, nice. The thunder rolling in the distance, the pitter patter of rain, the wind howling and trashing the trees about, the temperature, dropping a few degrees, and me under the warm cosy blanket. Gosh, I felt like a little kid again. The storm was so exciting and energetic, yet so calm and serene. I felt, at peace, you know? And it's been so long since I've found that peacefulness, that sense of happiness and at ease with the world. Everything was just.... perfect. Lovely.   Then of course I had to drag my ass out of bed to get to school, so....   Still, when I went outside, I was standing at the bus-stop, with the street light just above me... And I happened to look up and it was such a pretty sight. Really. It was still dark, and the way the rain hits the light and falls down in this circular pattern, and the orangey light being reflected off it, it looked so.... beautiful. Like sparkles... only these don't hurt, and they're just water. But they don't have the intense colour that sparkles from those sparkles (=P) do, they were softer, prettier, lighter. And they kept coming down, and down, and down, and they never ran out. It's like, I wish I could take a picture, but the picture would be such a poor attempt to capture the moment. A video could do I suppose, but it could never film the atmosphere, the whole feel to it. And it's quite sad, because you know that this is a once in a lifetime thing, and you just want to hold onto all that beauty. I remember I was talking to mr tan about something like this when we were hiking and we passed this really beautiful sunrise, and he said that it's always in man's nature to try to capture god's beautiful creations, but sometimes we just have to stop and just enjoy before the moment leaves us.   So enjoy. I feel like singing Robbie William's "Feel". =).   I seriously have been too influenced by American Beauty. haha. Lovely show, t'was.    oh btw i got back my FNN paper and the results. Probably the only A i'll get this year. Not that i've been getting tons of them, so.....

Erm, basically it's really really emotional rock. meaningful lyrics, loud, progressive, etc. erm, i cant really explain. lol. anw, most emo died out in the 80s and early 90s, but it's post emo now, which is still cool and i think it's a bit easier on the ears. lol. pure hardcore emo would be beyond me. dont think i could take the major transitions between te heavy and light. *shivers*. nvm if you dont understand. bah.   majorly happy that morgan tribe actually WON something.

      Wanted to say something... I've forgotten it though.    Tired to give you warning but everyone ignores me Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening Talk to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening.   I've got a heart full of pain, head full of stress, handful of anger held in my chest. And everything left is a waste of time I hate my rhymes, I hate everyone elses more I'm riding on the back of this pressure, cussing that it's better that I can't keep myself together Because all this stress gave me something to write on, the pain gave me something to set my sights on     nobody's listening by linkin park

      Sure. Don't send your kid to RGS. Cos you see, when she grows up right, all she will think about and know is school work and grades. She'll find it hard to fit into life and she won't get married like you. It's amusing isn't it? Here we have this Life writer person (ex-RGS gurl) who says she'll never send her kids (assuming that she'll change her character and find some guy out there someday) to RGS cos she doesnt want them to only know the academic world and nothing else, and we also have Beatrice Chia (ex-RGS gurl as well) who says that she'll be more than willing to send HER kids to RGS cos we lot have sexy minds underneath all that nerdy exterior.   The irony.   Oh and if that Life writer wants to send her nephew to a mission school, she had better not send him to ACS where he'll prolly end up nowhere near being a good boy. (I apologise to any ACS dude egos whom I've hurt by saying this). So much for mission schools. Doesn't she know that what schools say during the Open house is nowhere near a reflection of what the school really is? Naive, I say.

      tired. tired. tired. Seriously, i'm so busy now it's amazing.   The one thing I love about living in Punggol is the sky. Not that the sky in Singapore is any much different whether you're in Sentosa or Punggol, but it's just that cos it's all mostly fields and sea after that (you cant see the sea though, but basically it's clear), the sky is so VISIBLE. and there's so  much  so see. beautiful. I can stand at the NEL station and just enjoy the sky. I dont think it's something I can describe here, but the sky has always had a hold on my heart. The way the light from the sun bounces off the coulds and water, and forms all these beautiful shades of colour. The way the different types of clouds all overlap each other, and the way they merge and split and slowly waft about. It's just lovely. Everyday the mix of clouds and sun is different. Sometimes birds dot the blue too. And every moment of sky is unique. Special. One that you will probably never ever see again. Everyday I wish I had a camera or something for me to capture the moment. But I know that when I actually do that, the moment is gone. The feeling doesnt remain. The sunrise or sunset or just  that stretch of sky isn't special anymore. And I can just hope that when I grow up and as the place develops, somehow there will always be somewhere, some spot where I can still catch that Punggol sky.   That's why I love kayaking. Apart from the sea and water (hehhh), when you kayak and you see nothing but the sky and water, it's awesome. And mcritchie is nice for sunrise too. If you sit on the right side you see the reservior and the sky. No weird buildings in the way, blocking a cloud that could have made the scene perfect. Dhoby Gaut is pretty too. Sunrise as you walk from Park Mall to the station. Keep your head tilted to the right and you'll see it. Beautiful. It's always during these times do I remember the power of pastel colours and their ability to blend and mix and create that shade and texture. You dont get the same effect with bold colours, but they're still great anyway. lol.   Quid match tmr at 5am. Hope I can go onto the com without my mom making a big fuss. Hope I can cheer too. lol.

      lalala. Some guy called me up just now... told me that I had won the Nelly Furtado CD from 77th Street... Cool. He had a familiar voice though... a voice I had heard before... like a duck. =P.   Anyway, went back to school to take physics review test. Wasn't as bad as I expected, but I'm not taking my chances. Hopefully I didn't make many careless mistakes.   Going back to school on Friday. Gosh, I'm in Sec 4! I feel  old . *shiver* Blasted Os. bahhhhh.  Shall tell you about the weird dream I had last night. Okay, so it started off after another dream I had (of which I cannot recall). Me and a group of my friends are in this van/car, and the van stops right in front of some stadium/auditorium with a whole lot of people. It's either early morning or very late night. Yeah, so anyway, we get off right, and we're about to join the crowd. But my friend finds this underground passageway which leads us to the other side, which has a smaller crowd. So, we join the queue. The queue goes in the building, and I remember me and Jo standing on the staircases, and everything, because we're in this SUPER-long queue. You know those queues at amusement parks where you want an hour plus to get onto a ride? Well, this was WORSE. There were people everywhere. Thing was, we were queueing up for some concert. Weirder thing was that it was a sort of inter-school kind of concert. lol. Right, so me and Jo are standing there in the queue (the building's windows and walls are made of glass by the way, and it was bright by the time we got ahead in the queue) and I'm telling her about the weird dream I had before  this  one (talk about subconcious =P). lol. The queue we're in leads to the back of this hall-like stage, where we see the school(s) prefects' lounge, because you know, prefects HAVE to be there to keep order at these kind of things, right? Yep. So, me and Jo follow the queue past the lounge and we end up backstage. The performers weren't there yet (hell, I don't even know who were supposed to be watching!) and we were very ahead of the queue, so we just brushed past the curtains and went out to the hall. Then, Jo kept insisting that she sit RIGHT in front of the BLASTED speaker all the way at the front of the stage. (There were chairs right in front by the way). I warned her, but she refused to listen, so I just left her to her doom. The poor girl. Yeah, so then I made my way past the chairs, the empty space, to somewhere at the back where there's some tables and chairs set up. I find an empty table and get myself seated, when in bursts the two Janices through the side door (cos they were in another queue). Janice H decides to join me at my table, and they seat themselves there. At the table, there are cookies, yes  cookies , for us to take! Ain't that nice? lol. Yep, they're stacked and wrapped nicely in ribbons, and placed on plates for us to eat. hehe. While me and Jan H are helping ourselves to the cookies, in walks my fren Dar, all soaked and muddy (sorry dude, but I can't change my subconcious can I?) and dressed in racer biker gear (you know, the silverish suit and all). He has a motorbike helmet on and water's like, dripping from his shoes. hehe. He seats himself at our table, and proceeds to tell me all about how he had to get to the auditorium on his bike in the soaking rain and how he's all wet and muddy. Then he takes off his helmet and grabs some cookies from our table. haha.   Then I woke up. What a weird dream. lol. Of course, I know all the people who made cameo appearances, but what I dreamt isn't a reflection of their personality, nor is it a reflection of my relationships with them.

       [ Rockin' to: "Above me" Rufio ]   Am quite happy. People have been asking me what I want for my birthday, and it's llike three weeks away! I'm not even thinking of my own birthday. Talk about early planners. =S. Yeah, so I told the lot not to get me anything, except to help me find someone who would reverse bungy with me... and I have found that mad soul! yay!! No one in school would do it, either for fear or the cost, but I have found someone! *does a little dance* haha... yeah. So I'm gonna go down to clarke quay during my birthday, pay 30 bucks to get thrown up into the air, and then upon reaching the ground, puke. Ahhh. The things I do for a little adrenaline rush.

       [ Rockin' to: "Disease" Matchbox Twenty ]   WOOOT! We got another show for drama. Matinee on friday afternoon. More work, but at least it's less of a headache. I've got a day before drama. Must relax and get all my homework and stuff done... >_  Btw, some guys can be real ***holes. Especially those with real huge brains and even bigger egos.   I'm so borrreeeeddd. The only thing I have to do is either homework or drama. There isn't even any one to talk to! *hmph!* All busy reunion dinner-ing. Can't be bothered to do work. I'm far too lazy. Anyway, watched Mya's 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Love it. I loved the first movie, and I love the second as well. Action, really really really fast cars, bad guys, good guys and money. Nice. haha. Or maybe it's just watching Paul Walker work that blue car of his..... *hmmmmm*

       [ Rockin' to: "Forget December" Something Corporate ]   My tonsils haven't improved. I think I'm having even more trouble swallowing food now. It hurts so much that I've almost lost my appetite. Can't be bothered to eat now because it takes too much trouble. Bahhhh. Maybe i should just go to the doctor soon... Like, all the ticketing people are sick. lol. I think I've got the flu, but it got stuck at my tonsils instead, and infected that area... Damn, I'd rather have a sore throat. At least then I can EAT.  Passed my Physics and AMath retests!!! Woot! Physics was really really good, but Amath wasn't that good. But at least I passed. *phew* Bala was like "See, you can do it"... Yeah. Sure. haha.   I've done up a new layout, but it's like, not very nice because I've been so busy, I just rushed it. =X. If it's like, that bad then place a complain lar.... =P.

At least I'm trying to be more organised this year. I still haven't finished some other stuff that I planned to.. And I have Arithmancy due by the 20th! Oh no. lol.   Think I've got a sore throat of sorts. It's the tonsils area that hurts, not the whole throat itself, but if it doesn't ease up then I may tell my mom and go to the doc's.   I have GOT to sort out my tracks. I have a thousand plus..... and they're incredibly  messy

      A little update:   In school right now... We have a free block cos Mrs Naidu didn't come to school... and we've got CLE (Character and Leadership Education) after this. So ridiculous. I hope it's nice and work-free and gives me a good break. hehehehe. Only got that Calculus research homework due tomorow and my group's more or less finished with that, so I hope today I get to slack off a bit. heh. Everyone in class is either finishing their Bio prac homework or doing Amath. I refuse to (slacker me). We finally got some chalk for chalkboard, and me, jan h, debbie and elly defaced it in like, 10 minutes. Yepp. Now it's filled with doodles of lyrics, greek, height charts (half the class participated in that as well. haha), quotes (MRS Yap: "It's not that it's off, it's just that it's not on"), squiggly lines, football jerseys and demands for colour. *grin*. Okay, the whole class somehow broke into "Top of the World". hahaha. We're so hilarious.   Found my health booklet! It was trying to hide between my old files and it was like, sunk between the files so artfully that I  almost  couldn't see it. Did anyway. hah!  Bumped into an old friend on the train yesterday. Nice to catch up. =)  They're singing "If we hold on together" now. With Zit leading. I need my earplugs. hehhhh. Mrs Bala just came in.. bye!

      Argh. I KNEW that someone would use what I wrote against me. Very mean lehhhh. =/. You know who you are.  Had Amath review test today.... Wasn't too bad if not for the fact that I could not remember how to get all those angles for the trig question and how to do bionomial. Bahhhh. I hope I pass and I don't have to drop subs. Would be such a mess. Must put more effort in work. Easier said than done though.    Made Laksa and banana cake for F&N yesterday. Laksa wasn't too bad considering I don't really eat it myself, and the banana cake would have been better if I had cold whipped cream to go with it. Yumyum. *grins*. My Laksa had no kick though. =(. Should have added more dried prawns and chilli and fry long long. hahaha. My England very the good, no? =P  Can't find my stupid health booklet. Grrrrrrr.  Been listening to a lot of Something Corporate nowadays. It's another one of my phase things. Not that I mind. heh. First it was fuel, then third eye blind, matchbox twenty... I wonder what it will be next? Maybe Rufio or Interpol or AFI.Got their stuff but I never got round to listening.... Damn, I really wish I had an MP3 player. It'll make life so much easier.... Sigh.

Syukur. =). Then I went to the library and actually found the book that I've been looking for for so long... haha. Then I got home early, managed to catch Gilmore Girls on tv, and then my dad came home and passed me this John Mayor CD Hamper that I won! haha. What a surprise. Third time I won from this website.

       [ Rockin' to: "Minority" Greenday ]    Some people write very well. It's like when they put the fingers to the keyboard, or place the tip of that pen onto the clean piece of paper, everything just flows out of their minds through their hands and into writing. It's that easy for them, and that fast. I get really jealous. It's like their thoughts are one continuous thread or string, or blood flow or something, and it just has a one way path. And everything comes out. Nice and clean. The thoughts don't get tangled along the way, and everything they want to say comes out the right way and said. Somehow, for me, it seems that my thoughts all come down to the mouth, and get all muddled up before my tongue and lips can form the shape and I can say what I think. Either that or it gets stuck at the hands, and my fingers are stuck there and somehow don't move and type the things I want them to type. Do I have a psycho-motor skills disorder? Or does the problem actually lie in my brain? Or is the nerve impulses that get sent from the brain and down the spinal cord? Maybe my synapses don't transmit the impulses properly? =S....  I wonder.....   PS: I just realised, that I have made quite a few logical fallacies in there. Can you spot them? haha. I doubt Naidu would have been proud. haha.

       [ (still) Rockin' to: "Island in the sun" Weezer ]   Very interesting.. It's about multiple intelligence.... took this at a BBC website.   You are an Interpersonal thinker!  Interpersonal thinkers:  - Like to think about other people, and try to understand them  - Recognise differences between individuals and appreciate that different people have different perspectives - Make an effort to cultivate effective relationships with family, friends and colleagues  Like interpersonal thinkers, Leonardo had lots of friends and contacts, and was a popular figure at the Italian court.    Other Interpersonal thinkers include: Winston Churchill, Mother Teresa, William Shakespeare  Careers which suit Interpersonal thinkers include: Politician, Psychologist, Nurse, Counsellor, Teacher   Personality test @ BBC!   My Results  Extraversion Some people like lots of stimulation; they want people around them, activity and excitement, whilst others prefer to be able to focus on things in a calm and quiet environment. Most people prefer a blend of the two extremes and your answers suggest that you are quite comfortable in either situation. You can probably cope with things being a bit hectic or a bit quiet but, like most people, you may find extremes in either direction uncomfortable or annoying.  Confidence Some people make decisions very easily and tend not to worry about them before or afterwards while, at the other extreme, some people are so careful and cautious that the decisions never get made! Taking a cautious approach can be a good thing (do you want to fly with a pilot that is so free from worry and concern that she never checks her controls and instruments and doesn't bother to communicate with air-traffic control?) and you seem to have described yourself as someone who does tend to be quite cautious and careful. This can be very important in detailed work or areas were mistakes can have a major cost although you may find yourself avoiding risks and many cautious people wish they were bolder.  Openness While some people like experimenting with new things and ideas, others prefer traditional methods and taking a very practical approach to problems. Your answers suggest that you may be reluctant at times to consider new approaches and ways of doing things, but that you understand the value of tried and proven methods and of lessons that have already been learnt.  Agreeableness Most people want to be able to get on with others but to some it is the most important thing in the world, whilst others are quite happy to upset someone else if it means that things get done. Your answers suggest that you can be firm with people when you need to be but that getting on with others is still important to you. Like most people you would rather avoid conflict but are not prepared to put up with being treated badly by others.   Conscientiousness  Some people like everything to be well planned, tidy and organised, whilst others prefer to deal with things as they come up and appear to work in absolute chaos. Your answers suggest that you don't like having things too structured or being tied down and you can cope quite well without having to have everything organised. This may make it hard to find things at times or for colleagues to know where you are or what you are doing, but you probably find coping with the unexpected (the things your colleagues didn't plan for!) easier than many.

       [ Rockin' to: "Island in the sun" Weezer ]   Went to watch Mystic River after PI today. Went to lido to catch the 10.30 show cos it was the earliest and I had to rush back to school by 2. Personally I dont really like lido, but it was the earliest one, so... My gosh, I was so pissed. I tell you, I am never going back to lido if I can help it. So irritating. I was in school u lar, and I went up to the counter and asked for 6 tix. The lady glares at me and asks how old I am. I tell her, 16. She says, I want to see all your ID. So I hand over my ID while the others get theirs out. Then the lady squints at it, and shows it to her friend to ask if 88 is the right year. And then she turns to me and goes, "No, you're not 16 yet, it's not your birthday". And I go "Oh, birthdays matter? That's so... " And she and her friend starts getting fierce and go on about how it is the law and it's not ridiculous. By then heidi di hanyin and mel are like "Nevermind lar. We watch another movie." And I'm like, "Okay, I understand, but I'm 16! My birthday was last wednesday - the 18th." And the two of them goondo heads squint somemore at my ID and go "No, 18 haven't passed yet.", and they make this HUGE fuss without realising that it is already the 20th! So I like give up, and the rest decide they'll go catch another movie somewhere else, and they're like "Since you have to go back to school, you and janh go watch it la.. it's okay." So they go off, and me and janh go to another counter to buy the tickets. And the lady THERE, another blurhead, says "You're not 16 yet, you cannot watch,". And i'm like getting really frustrated by then, and I go "I am! My birthday was on the 18!" And she goes around to check (my gosh, what, these people don't know the date is it?) and then she comes back and she's like "Oh. You just made it," and then proceeds to give us the spasticated ticket. Then just before we go in, the guy checks out stubs and goes "How old are you? *checks id* You're  not 16 yet" and I'm like "I am!!!! (is nearly cursing out loud) My birthday was last wednesday on the 18th!" and he has to like go and check with the other ticket stub tearer person and then there was this whole confusion where the two of them kept telling me that I wasn't old enough until I got really pissed and they actually LOOKED at the ID and the date this time and then they were like "Oh, I thought it was on the 26th". Gosh, dammit. What the hell is wrong with these people? I understand the whole law and not allowing people and stuff, even though I think the birthday this is so freakingly stupid, but then they could have at least CHECKED the card first before jumping to some fucked up conclusion. Also, even if I wasn't 16, they could have been more professional about asking for the ID and telling me off. Sheesh. I went to GV and they were so much more professional about it. The guy actually went "Can I see your ID please?" and didn't like jump to conclusions nor make a huge fuss when I declined and asked for tickets to another movie instead. Gosh, Lido is like in the slumps. I'm  never  going there again. The service sucks, the seats and theatre sucks.   Now, onto the movie. It was really good, I thought. The movie was really really intense and clint eastwood managed to hold onto it without making the movie draggy. I kinda guessed the murderer though, so it was a bit spoilt for me. heh. The acting was superb, and I liked the way the scenes were played out. A very charged film, and deffo worth your money. I wouldnt really watch it again cos it's takes up so much of my energy, but then it would be kinda nice to fully understand the relationships between the characters and how the kidnap played such a huge role in the story. It was like when the show ended I just sat back and went "Whoa.". lol. If it wasn't for the show, I would have been damn pissed off at Lido. I'm kinda happy I watched it. =).   PS: My aunt and parents gave me money for my birthday. =). And my other aunt gave me this necklace. Wah man, I already busted quite a bit of money today, what with the movie, food, the cd i bought, and the stupid tickets for the acjc thing. Now I dont even know if I can make it. =S

Okay, the people I want to talk to aren't online... so I think I shall blog about my trip before I forget about the details.   I was feeling quite well when I got back home, but I went to take a nap and now I'm feeling quite sore. Let's see... where do I start? The expedition was quite awesome. From Dabong train station in Kelantan (which is about 12 hours away by train) we took a sampan across a river and then a van to get to the foot of Gunung Stong. Stong's not the tallest mountain there lah, only stands at 1399m, Gunung Ayam next to it is much taller. But the waterfall.... *whoa*. Breathtaking, I tell you. We hiked for about an hour plus from the foot up to our first view of the waterfall. And when we saw it, we just stood there and GAPED. I'm serious. It's one of those places which look so good on postcards and magazines and you seriously wonder if you would ever ever go somewhere as beautiful as that. Yeah. So, we crossed the waterfall (at the shorter and less wider parts) and trekked along the granite rocks up. This part got me really scared because not only were the rocks slippery, I was carrying a 10kg bag on my back and it was STEEP. Thank Allah we made it though, and then we continued back into the forest and carried on our trek up to the first campsite, which took about 2 to 3 hours. Bumped into a lot of local teenagers on holiday, and they kept asking where we were from. lol. And everytime we said "Singapore", they would go "Wah, jauh tu!" (which means whoa, far!). haha. Quite amusing. Yepp. Reached campsite (Jelawang Jungle) about lunch, where we waded in the waterfall pools, had lunch and stood at the edge of the waterfall drop which had a wonderful view overlooking the forest. =). Lots of space there to camp too. We were actually supposed to camp further up so that we would have an easier time with the summit push, but a my junior had some problem with her knees, so we set up our tents there instead and pushed for the summit the next day. Spent the rest of the day hiking further upstream so that we could go to this really nice secluded spot and bathe there, but it started to drizzle, and we decided to head back to our campsite to bathe instead. Man, the water is wonderful. Coooolldddd, but very clear and refreshing. We bathed at this part where there was this huge slab of granite and the water was sliding off it into this deep pool lined with boulders at the side. Me, being a super excited one (my family used to bring me to kota tinggi when I was young and i loved it) was the first one in after mr tan. hehe. Then I naturally climbed up rocks and jumped in and we did funny somersaults. Played for about an hour plus then we went to cook dinner. Yumyum. haha. Yeah, so next day was the summit push. Took us about 8 hours to go up and come back down. The summit push was really tricky, and the view wasn't that wondrous, but it was good to be up there and eat lunch whilst watching the clouds and mountains play hide and seek. lol. sort of. =P. Our local guide was really cool. On our way up he taught us how to boil eggs using moss, how to tell and pull out ginger, pulled out rattan fruit and tongkat ali leaves (!) for us to eat, and plucked off a lemongrass branch to let us smell (apparently it works as a good repellant too). Yep, and then we went swimming again after we returned back to camp. haha. Next day woke up and packed tents before sunrise and we headed back down. Got down in 2 hours, caught a train to Gua Musang which is an hour or two away, where we went caving and had dinner before taking the overnight train back to Singapore. Yep, so that pretty much sums up my trip, cos I'm too tired to say anything more and I have a lot of homework to do in slightly over one day. haha. =S.  Hmm. Some other random stuff:  - the elections in Kelantan is scary. there are banners and posters and fliers and flags EVERYWHERE.  - i think i'm getting better at acting as a translator. hehe. was forced to make orders and ended up having conversations with some of the locals.  - amusing. we bumped into bedok ite on their way to pahang on the train, and bumped into them again on the way back. what are the odds, man? lol.  - i had ramli burger! woot! was looking for rabbit meat, but couldn't find... so i had plain old special chicken. haha.  - couldn't find the utopia magazine that i bought at KL, maybe it's just a KL mag. =(.  - river water tastes really weird after putting puritabs in them. they taste of the river. =P.  - found really amusing yam and sugar cane syrup. haha.  - stayed up till 4 playing cards with my junior who was too freaked to go to bed (in the train) because we found tiny cockroaches on it.  - never pass me another raisin.

Every time it rains really heavily everything changes. The view changes and it has this sheen and feel to it. And everything always smells so nice when it pours. Heavy rain makes me feel calmer. Like, there's a storm raging outside but you're nice and calm inside. Even if you ARE outside, then well, you can go wreck havoc out there. lol.

I'm trying to brace myself for the 16th of May. And it doesn't help that I have ODAC farewell on the 14th over to the 15th. Awesome. So awesome. Why do my stuff always get clumped together? Some weird luck I have. All my events are like one day after another or on the same day, so I'm busy for that period of time, then I'm very very free. So freaking odd.   No one is online for me to talk to. =(. And those that are aren't replying. Maybe I will go offline in a short while and do some homework.   My parents got some VCDs! yay! So when I'm free (which is god knows when) I can sit down and enjoy a movie. *is feeling happy* The last time I watched a movie was like, all the way back in Feb, when I watched mystic river. hmm.

Friendship, loyalty, love, devotion, sacrifice. *sniffsniff* It's so sweet! And I always get really irritated when the best friend never gets his girl. See lah, took so long to realise your love for her. And then when he finally realises he loves her, oops too late, she fell for another guy and he becomes her lover. Then the poor best friend have to give way and just stay a friend. So sad ='(. I'm always rooting for the best friend(s) because I think love really stems from friendship, you know? And the fact that the person has always been there with and for you, should really count towards something. I dunno. >. could  have some way of becoming true huh? hahaha. Dream on girl.

       [ Still "Caught in the Rain" by Revis ]   I've been depressed before.... I've hit rock bottom, and I've gone through times that were seriously really tough on my emotional, physcological and physical state. I emphatise with people who are down in the dumps and are having a tough time. But what I don't understand is how some people never seem to want to get out of that depression. They  know  that they're depressed, they know what's causing the depression, they rant on about it (that's fine, I mean everyone needs to release steam,) but they never seem to get out of it. Okay, so a week, a month is fine.... but then two, three months later and they're still right at the bottom. I mean, okay, so depression takes a long time to get over, that's not something I'll argue about. But to still be right at the bottom? They seem to make a half-attempt at standing up, hooray about it, then 'fall' back down to the ground again. Then they hit rock bottom. Makes me wonder whether these people actually  like  being depressed. Makes me wonder whether they actually derive some sort of satisfaction with having self-pity. I simply don't understand why they keep doing this. Don't they get sick of being so pitiful of themselves? Don't they want to achieve something? Do something about it? And these people are smart mind you... they could seriously DO something. I don't understand. I mean, I had a time when I was wallowing in self-pity... but then I think I tried to do something about it, and I'm proud to say that now I'm at least not that the same level as I was at the last time. At least I tried, and improved. These people.... they make some half-attempt so that they can SAY that they tried, and it didn't work. What kind of attitude is that? Sheesh. Makes me ashamed to say that I even know them. Gosh.  and yes, yes I know that my spelling sucks. Shut up. =P.

And I'm tired and cranky. Grrr. My back hurts from turning around from the com to look at the TV too much, because I was online 'discussing' geog when nothing much was being done and so I passed the time by finishing my HOL homework and watching american idol and CSI. And I'm pissed because I didn't even watch the whole of CSI and I missed the starting. I HATE missing bits and pieces of shows. It's one of those small little things that I absolutely hate. And now we're in geog supposedly doing up some project which is like done, cos my group already finished it at home. But the teacher insists that we come down to the raffles room, so... urgh. I'm tired of going up and down the stairs god-knows-how-many-times-a-day. My knees are going to go bust. Argh.  Got ODAC today. We're doing abseiling. So that probably means I'll be behind the wall again. Blah. It's damn dirty and dusty and has terrible ventilation in there. Prolly because we're not even supposed to be in there in the first place.

Your Existing Situation Seeks to share a bond of understanding intimacy in an esthetic atmosphere of peace and tenderness.   Your Stress Sources The situation is regarded as threatening and dangerous. Outraged at the thought that she will be unable to achieve her goals and distressed at her feeling of helplessness to remedy this. Over-extended and feels beset, possibly to the point of nervous prostration.  Your Restrained Characteristics Circumstances are forcing her to compromise, to restrain her demands and hopes, and to forgo for the time being some of the things she wants. Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity.  Your Desired Objective Needs a change in her circumstances or in her relationships which will permit relief from stress. Seeking a solution which will open up new and better possibilities and allow hopes to be fulfilled.  Your Actual Problem Agitation, unpredictability, and irritation accompanying depleted vitality and intolerance of further demands have all placed her in a position in which she feels menaced by her circumstances. Feeling powerless to remedy this by any action of her own, she is desperately hoping that some solution will provide a way of escape.  Your Actual Problem #2 The fear that she may be prevented from achieving the things she wants leads her into a relentless search for satisfaction in the pursuit of illusory or meaningless activities.

      Okay, as you can tell, I'm bored, so I shall put up another post tonight.   Today was cool. My mom thought I was supposed to wake up at 7, so I was late for netball carn. But it was alright. Came in just in time to do shooting. Then acted as watergirl for the players and cheered them on. The best part was us playing with the waterguns of course. Me and hweifen had an evil time. haha. She attacked me, so I sneaked up behind her, grabbed her collar and squirted water down (under) her t-shirt. hehe. Then naturally she retaliated and we ran around the courts trying to get each other. haha. She didn't manage to return back my prank though. hehhh. Don't mess with me man.    After a very wet netball carn we went down to suntec and had lunch. Then we decided to get wet again and run under the big suntec fountain. haha. Damn funny. We ran like what, 3 times, just to get a decent video of it? Was so soaked at the end. Just hope the suntec officials don't give the school a call about us. hehe. Some people went off the watch troy, I busted enough cash and couldn't stay, so went home to konk off and slack.   Oh yeah. Yesterday me and su-e went to catch 'mean girls' since I won a pair of tickets from 77th street. My mulut is very very masin. On the way up I was saying that it would be quite funny if they didn't let us eat in the preview lounge. And guess what, when the lift door opened there was this super huge sign that said "NO FOOD AND DRINKS IN THE PREVIEW LOUNGE", so I had to finish my popcorn outside. Then I said that it would be quite funny if they made us wait, cos we were rushing before that so that we could make it in time, and guess what? The lady came up to us and went "I'm sorry, they're running late on their own screening, so could you come back at 5.05?". Man, su-e was laughing so so hard. =P. haha. She tried getting me to say that she would win a million dollars, but I highly doubted it would work. I tried saying that hopefully we'll meet some cute guy who would come up to us and say hi, but by the time I got home I didn't even spot a good-looking guy, so I guess my masin-ness stops short of guys and money. haha.

Let's see. What's there to say about Karnival Suka-Suka? It was superb. Okay, so the starting was a bit stressful, and I freaked out again, as usual, but looking back, I think I'm gonna miss it lots. I love the asthetics sub jk! We were like stressing about the venue, and setting up of stations and all, but it was so much fun! And there was so much to laugh about, from the stupid jokes and stuff we told to crack each other up, to picking a warring words fight with rusydi (heh), nadz being such a bum and not wanting to reach out to grab the  marker  eraser (edit: indra says she was reaching out for an eraser =P. lol) ("ah, jauh nah") to us saving tape by cutting it in half (which didn't work), to my lousy malay and indra coming along to save pejam (haha), to siti and her kuti signs, to lestari learning how to play congkak on the spot, to azimah who had to deal with the weird apa gunanya uses, to me thinking that one of the ri sec 1 peeps was a mendaki kid and getting whacked for it. haha. And hidayah and johan! So cute! Man, it was awesome! And pejam celik was so much fun, watching the facis and kids freak out and try to get the answers right, and the kids not reaching the boards and us putting up double pictures on certain stations. haha. And then the non-asthetics part too. Us trying to put up a dikir performance (go naf!) and kru semangat! haha. And carrying out trash, and being bored, and the flooded toilets, and just hanging around after ks2, catching up with hazmi cos neither one of us wanted to go home.   I am going to save our debrief e-mails. Lovely. I'm going to miss the karnival and I'm gonna miss everybody.

Watched the lights twinkle from the ports, and watched superstart virgo leave the harbour. It was so bright and sparkly. Poor haslina wanted to take a photo, but she couldnt get a camera in time. Poor thing. Sec 1s did an awesome job with the decor, I still have my tissue flower which i dipped in scented wax. Very pretty. My most artistic creation yet. haha. Walked back to Labrador Adventure Center, then we showered and went up to their seminar room for presents and skit play thingy. They didnt get our play at all, but the sec 3s caught some of the com positions. haha. Ms chew (yay!) and ms chia (not so yay) came along. Really didnt expect them to be there, and I totally did not expect ms chia to get us presents. Quite sweet of her actually. I really like the earrings and the little firecracker. Exchanged presents, sang a few songs, went outside and did some games thingy, and by the time we went to bed it was about 1 plus in the morning. Then got up at 6.30 and geared up for ropes course. THE SUN WAS SO HOT!! and we were in the sun from 8 to 2. It was horrible. No shade, and the sun didnt let up at all. Belaying people is lots of fun. haha. I really like it. Much more fun than doing the course yourself. I think rapelling is so cool. Ropes course wasn't very spectacular, I think the one at Sing poly was a lot cooler. Still, first time I did the zipline, and I think unhooking people from the zipline after their turn is very fun. haha. Instructor said that she had never cleared 24 people for the zipline in 1 and a half hours. We were THAT good. =P hahaha. But still cuold have improved. They were joking around lots, which wasnt bad actually, just that when it was ms cheryl's turn we messed up somehow. Maybe it was subconcious. hehehe. K bell rang. I shall continue later.   Okay. Back. Now at home, after dinner. Let's see... after ODAC camp, I offered to pay for Siti and my ride back to school for dikir cos I was feeling damn good and hyper. Christl tagged along, and by the time we hailed one, ms cheryl decided to follow so she could take a shower in school. I think we stank up the poor taxi. haha. Had dikir, instructor brought a lot of cool instruments for us to play with. He's very cute in a very little kiddish sort of way.   Okay, KS2 in the next post when I've built up my stamina for another looong post. lol.

       [ "Smooth" by Santana featuring Rob Thomas ]    So hard to find a date to watch a movie. lol. Let's hope it doesn't get cancelled again.   Went for cip meeting in the morning. I overslept, as usual, and took the train before swapping over to the cab. There goes my money. Irk. How wasteful. Sigh. Anw, meeting was quite boring, as usual. I was feeling quite restless. But at least some stuff is settled, and one of the ri helpers (rusydi) came down. Finally we can get started on the putting together the whole thing.   Went to watch Sing to the Dawn yesterday. Poor jus had an extra ticket cos the person he asked didnt want to go with him, so I ended up accompanying him last minute. What was good: Show was very professional, I had a nice time, Acting was superb, Opening song was lovely. What was not so good: The rest of the songs (sorry man), The fact that I was the only girl amongst a whole lot of guys, Everyone thinking that jus was my bf (which, for the record, he is not). Azi was acting, and me guano marian and jus went over to congratulate him. Naturally we looked for the biggest crowd. haha. But he came out late anw, and was crying (with happiness, he said) when we got jus to pass him the rose he was forced to buy. haha. Very insincere. =P.    ORA day tmr. Will be at jogathon and manning the perbayu stall. Then..... heh.   No school on monday, but going shopping/discussion for ODAC farewell day. There goes my weekend.

       [ "Six Feet from the Edge" by Creed ]    Thought I'd have a bit of fun and check out my horoscope:   Aquarius (5th May 2004) Your natural wit and way with words is about to come in pretty darned handy now. You'll be able to stun and amaze not just the usual suspects, but a whole new array of admirers, who'll soon be friends.   Did a few emode quizzes as well! Miss them.    What's your Gift of Gab?    "Laying On The Laughter"  Laughter really is the best medicine. For a friendly and funny soul like you, nothing opens up communication lines and lowers people's defenses like a hearty chuckle, sidesplitting guffaw, or shared snicker. Whether you're trying to defuse tense situations or liven up dull ones, humor always seems to lighten the mood and get people talking. Whether your wit is revealed through goofy jokes, dark humor, edgy sarcasm, or sophisticated satire, your true gifts are showcased when you're making wisecracks. So bring on the slapstick, the irony, and the jests — eventually we'll all be laughing with you.    What Kind of Troublemaker Are You?  "Entertaining Mischief-Maker"   Fun at all costs. These are the words you live by. Are you in the running for class clown — always cracking jokes, pantsing classmates, or making scenes? Or are you more stealth with your jokes — anonymously making crank calls, planting fake vomit, and pulling fire alarms? Whatever your prank-pulling MO, it's just a little harmless amusement you're after. And if making a fool out of yourself or getting into trouble is the consequence, you'll happily take it. You've got a quick wit and spirited outlook on life that usually makes it hard for people not to forgive your playful and mischievous ways. Just be sure your jokes and pranks don't wear out their welcome. That's no fun at all.   *is incredibly amused*

If I could just take a nap, then I could be a bit more refreshed. But no, I have spent the last two hours trying to take a 40 minute nap, and I have no given up. Am solely running on blood glucose and adrenaline. My head pounds, I've eaten lunch, but am prepping myself with bananas, sweets and cakes, and I 've been drinking lots of plain water cos my throat is sore. Argh. I know I'm not sick, it's just that I need my bloody sleep.   First day of school was the usual. Sucked.

       [ rockin' to: "In the Shadows" by The Rasmus ]    Okay, so school has started. And as usual, I haven't finished my holiday homework. How am I gonna make it for the Os man? Bahhhh. Anyway, here's the update for mocks. Amath = the first time my paper looked so  filled . Physics = damn careless mistakes, damn! Chem prac = woohoo. awesome, all perfect except for design experiment, where I'm probably gonna get 0.   Heard the LP concert ROCKED. *is feeling extremely jealous* Damn, I knew I should have crashed the padang.    Today was incredibly amusing. After dikir we (didi, naf, faqy, me, with nadz tagging along) went out, as usual. Then we spotted this super good-looking ang-moh guy along orchard. And, us being (boy) crazy people were err, looking (okay, okay, gushing). And of course, me being me, didn't want to go home, so when we reached orchard, I suggested that we walk to somerset and count the number of cute guys we can find along the way. So, we did.  Wait, don't laugh yet. Guess how many guys were on our count?  TWO including the one I mentioned. haha. How sad is that? We're out on one of the orchard's busiest afternoons, and we only spot two good-looking guys, of which one is foreign. Oh dear. Maybe we should have lowered our expectations. And we only spotted the other guy right after naf exclaimed that we prolly couldn't find another one.  Saw a lot of chiobus in comparison. Ah wells. haha.    My uncle passed away, so I've been busy helping out at the kenduri and stuff. It's freaky being in such a  melayufied  atmosphere. And this nenek who was talking to my mom was like, *sees me* "Oh, kalau-kalau ada anak bujang, boleh kenalkan. *winks to me*". Then she turns to some makcik (who isn't related to me) "Eh, awak punyer anak lelaki kedua boleh kan? *turns back to me* Atiqah dan Md Ridwan, sedap apa bunyinye! Boleh pun!". And here I am half-laughing and half-freaking out. They're plotting to bring the guy around to tomorrow's kenduri. Die. hahaha. My mom was laughing her ass off and saying that in nowaday's generation, you can't try to matchmake. Only intro and let the kids figure out for themselves. Go mom. haha.

       [ Rockin' to: "The Zephyr Song" by Red Hot Chili Peppers ]   Just finished reading Agatha Christie's "Mousetrap". It reminds me of "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd". Loved that book. I thought it was a complete masterpiece! Was trying not to guess the murderer, and I ended up guessing wrongly anyway. haha.

       [ Rockin' to: "Wonderwall" by Oasis ]    Three days to bio mocks and I have barely done two chapters. =|  My 100th post. Wow.    Hmm. The current copy I have of going under is odd. Fades in and out. I shall go change it. Oh, and someone owes me a jet cd! haha. Actually, I want to flip through the cover booklet more than listen to the CD, since I've already heard most of the tracks. CD booklets are so pretty. Glossy and all.   I am very proud of my erm, *cough* music collection. Very wide and varied. Okay, overstatement. I probably can count the number of hip-hop/r&b tracks I have on my two hands. Very impressive, I know. haha!  Got this off eu's blog.

       [ Rockin' to: "Mad World" by Gary Jules ]   Had dikir today. Instructor came late, so we decided to fool around first. Ended up talking about idols. haha. Then naf and faqy decided to teach that very lenggok-y "Biar terluka" song. (I have enclosed the very nice melayu lyrics here. Ask me for a translation if you want one.)And this kakak from batch '97 who was there for the angklung performance dropped by and taught us how to sing the song properly. She's quite cool. lol. Kak Ratna was her name, I  think .   "Biar berluka parah dan berdarah,  Dengan merelakan semangat, semarak waja  Meruntuhkan kemunafikan yang dijajah, Namun tetap menuju terus ke tengah,  Walau meniti gelombang dan lautan diredah."   Any mistakes in malay are entirely mine. My malay is THAT bad. =|  Anyway, aaron is one lying a******. Good that he didn't really come down.

It involved flirting classes, my mom and aunts, engagement parties and a particular guy friend who ended up being my second cousin. Don't ask. I told you it was weird.   Okay, off to amath remedial now.

       [ Rockin' to: "Window to the Past" by John Williams (off the hpPOA soundtrack) ]   I don't usually listen to soundtracks, especially if it involves instrumental music, but I must say, John Williams did an awesome job with the POA soundtrack. (Okay, so maybe I'm a bit biased). Check out above mentioned song. Very soothing.  Amath remedial has been good. My Amath is so damn hopeless, I'm attending all the sessions (like the kiasu-Singaporean I am) with the hope that I can improve it. Now I just need to get practising. Right. Easier said than done.    On another note, aaron's coming down on friday/saturday for a 3-week stay. Damn.

Pity they're either actors, or singers, or students from Hogwarts, or.....   ... bus conductors on a particular purple bus. *wink*   haha.    I'm just hyper. Really. >.

Eye of newt and toe of frog,  Wool of bat and tongue of dog,  Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,  Lizard's leg and howlet's wing.   Double, double, toil and trouble  Fire burn and cauldron bubble  Double, double, toil and trouble  Something wicked this way comes.

       [ Rockin' to: "Closing time" by Semisonic ]   Did another emode quiz.   Which Emoticon Are You? Atiqah, the emoticon that represents you best is the Devil Face! You little rascal. OK, so maybe trouble isn't your middle name, but we suspect you can be a bit mischievous at times. You're a playful person who enjoys stirring up a little trouble where you can. Don't worry, we won't tell. But we will tell you this: Playing pranks, testing people's naïveté, and fudging the truth a little can be fun. So can finding out the latest gossip — as long as it doesn't hurt anyone's feelings. But you knew that. So log on and keep making life more interesting. Your friends appreciate the entertainment, just be sure not to take it too far, troublemaker!   haha. how cute. >.   Second day of SSS today. 'Twas quite fun. We did some kayakking in the morning, and I took the single kayak since I was the odd one out in my group. Freaked out my group ic (who is in canoeing) cos he asked me to do some stuff and I did them mostly without any problem. Then after he was like *stunned look* "You learn fast.", I told him that I got my 2-star. haha. Anyway, I wasn't ego and arrogant okay, I was very obedient and humble. haha. Then climbing was really really cool. Me and gerri tried out the NJC wall, and gosh, is it dirty. haha. Reached the top! Yay! =). Got our t-shirts for SSS, said out debriefs and goodbyes, then went off. Sigh. I hate it when you meet people for a few days and then you prolly wont ever meet them ever again. Very depressing. =(. Anw SSS has been real good. Great job peeps!

       [ Rockin' to: "Truth is a Whisper" by Goo Goo Dolls ]   Thanks to ilman I actually remembered that I have 26 goo goo dolls tracks on my com and that I've only prolly listened to only 5 of them. haha   Been reading gilmore girls transcripts because I don't have my usual dramas to watch now. =(. Anyway, gilmore script rocks! I love their references and their witty getbacks. Damn, wish I could do that too, and have people witty enough to reply. haha. (rriiigghtt)  Had triple S today. Was quite fun actually. Okay lah, shant say bad stuff about nj, ahlam was very sincere in his apology and it wasn't really his fault I guess. They're quite nice people. Had a good chat with some of them. lol. Pity we couldnt get to know them better, if not we could have swapped numbers or email adds and kept in touch. And apparently we can come down on sat now. So, that's good. I just need to send an email to the teachers to tell them. God, I'm exhausted. Yesterday had gep conference and then today had this.   I watched HP PoA yesterday! It was much much better than the first two, I thought. Major loopholes and some scenes were awfully touchy and not needed, but it is a better movie. Still love the books though. And they made Ron a very comic character. And Hermione is losing her uniqueness which made her Hermione. I hope they dont keep this up in book 4, if not I'm not gonna be happy again. >.  Kayakking and rock-climbing tomorrow. Haven't kayaked in a really long time. Hopefully I'll be alright. Anyway, damn tired, chill out peeps, I shall go to bed now.

       [ Rockin' to: "She's So High" by Everclear ]   I currently hate Project SSS, teachers and NJC. What kind of bloody lousy administration is this? Telling us 3 days before the camp that we need a teacher in charge present. What the hell man. Like as if our teachers can be picked off the rack and just shoved into a bloody camp. They're busy too lah. And if we can't find a teacher then we have to pull out. Wah. This is like the most important piece of information lah. Now then you bloody tell us. And now mrs bala can't make it cos she's involved with GEP conference, and i suspect that ms neo is too, so I'm praying damn hard that ms goh isn't involved in anything, will reply soon and save our butts. And I'm very pissed because our butts wouldnt have needed saving if it wasn't for the lousy co-ordination and bloody protocol on the njc side. There is a difference between miscommunication and no communication at all. Miscommunication I can deal with. No communication and then passing the responsibility onto us, I cannot. I refuse to accept responsibility for something which I am not entirely responsible for. Argh. I hate it when things which are not my problem are made my problem. And at a last minute at that. Like what the hell. I have no magic wand, and I do not do miracles. I don't know what I'm gonna do if this thing can't pull off. NJ is so gonna hear about this.    On another note, I am very excited about watching HP tomorrow. It's the only thing that's keeping me sane this week. And I want to ride on the knight bus (and see those cute conductors that everyone keeps talking about). The rest of my family is watching tonight (they planned to watch next week actually), because my aunt decided to buy tickets to watch tonight at Northpoint. Hmph. If only I had the gift of foresight.

       [ rockin' to: "Vindicated" by Dashboard Confessional ]   This particular song by dashboard sounds so SoCo. I was listening to it and wondering why the song kept bugging me... and now I'm listening to it, and it finally hit me! One of the verses sound so SoCo. And dashboard is only made up of one guy. Okayyy. haha. Coolios. Hmm. emo.    Did I tell you that I went to watch Spiderman 2? Don't say anything mean cos I'm biased and I love it. *evil laughter* Okay, I can make consessions for people who think that MJ was kinda irritating throughout the movie.    I wanted to listen to a song. I forgot which song it is though. Sigh.    Been incredibly busy, as usual. Been trying to finish up F&N coursework and stuff, and that in itself has been driving me nuts. All the things we do for F&N as coursework is not being taken into Os. Very freaked out that I might not get that A1. I must though. If not it would be such a waste. God help me. >.   Been going to the library to borrow comics. Marvel comics! Yay. haha. Borrowed the original graphic novel for Road to Perdition as well. Found some CSI comics, but I had to wait for my card to clear before I could borrow, and by the time I went back to get them they were gone. Haish. Looks like I'll have to wait for another time.    Ah now I remember. Nirvana. Smells like teen spirit. *sniff*

       [ rockin' to: "Love will Come Through" by Travis ]   Limmy says it's taboo for me to date a boring guy. Me and eu asked her what that meant and she said that I can only date fun guys cos I need a fun guy to keep up with my crazy personality. Get a boring guy and my relationship will be doomed from the very start. Gist of it anyway. haha. That gurl is very amusing.

Ohhhh, it doesn't matter what you wear, just as long as you are there. So, come on, every guy, grab a gurl, everywhere around the world, they'll be dancing.....  wheee~! Finally, the loooong weekend! I get to sleep properly and actually have time to breathe and study. So behind schedule. >.  So sorry I'm not going for codeRED guys. I just think I'll be super paiseh-ed and then I'll just wreck everything. I know, I know, I make a complete fool of myself in front of you all all the time. haha. But when it comes to a complete stranger, I get really really weirded out. >.  CLE the other day was real interesting. We were supposed to discuss abortion, and stuff, but the class really didn't want to cos we've discussed it so many time already and we're good people. =P. Cracked a lot of jokes and stuff. Here's one: mrs bala: Atiqah, how would you feel if you found out you were pregnant? me: Well, I'll be very shocked because I haven't even had sex yet! *class roars with laughter*  ms goh: Well, what should the guy do? sue: Guys are irresponsible jerks, they will never take responsibility one! elly: I agree!! me: Aiyah, then don't do out with an irresponsible guy lah. sue: Ahh, but how do you know if he's responsible or not? me: Good question. *turns to mrs bala* Mrs bala! How did you know if your husband was responsible or not? mrs bala: *giggling* Mine's a different case. ms goh: I know! You know if he's responsible if you're the one being irresponsible and he says no me: Ah. Right, so now if we wanna know if he's responsible we just come onto him and hopefully he'll say no sue: Right. What are the chances of that ever happening? haha.  On another note, my sister has found my blog. bahh. I've got nothing against her reading it, just don't like her blabbing. =P. Hmm. Guess I should censor everything here for people below 16 then. hahahahahaha. (joking!)

      Right. So here I am in school, doing up my coursework B for F&N. Yes, I am at it again. Today I'm supposed to be finishing up the last bits, especially my conclusion, so that I can hand it in to be marked and sent to the O-level board. I just realised that prelims is in less than 2 weeks. wow. Time passes by really fast and I am so not prepared. = I don't like this computer. The keyboard is soft and sticky and doesn't feel very good when typed on and the screen is tilted at a weird angle. I want to go back to the Shaw Lab. Bunch of science teachers kicked us out of there for their prep-and-let's-eat-cake-and-talk session. Okay. I tried tilting the screen and how it's too low. Hmph. There. Now it's better. And adjusted the brightness and contrast too. Goodie. Did I tell you that geog is driving me nuts? haha. Our whole geog class wants to throw all out revision exercises out of the window. Hmm. I take that back. Maybe not heidi. =P codeRED. Pity I'm not going. But then, I'll be so embarrassed and paiseh-ed that I'll prolly spoil it anyway. Hope they have fun though. =) Alright, alright. Back to F&amp;N. I'll continue later when I get more progess with it. *achoo* gosh, this computer is dusty.
