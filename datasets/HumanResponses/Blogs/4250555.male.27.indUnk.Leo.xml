      Just to make sure everyone is up to speed:  I work at Birraporetti's in downtown Houston, in the Theater District.  For those of you who may be unfamiliar with that part of town, the Theater District is the northern most part of downtown where the Wortham, Jones Hall, TUTS, the Alley, and other performing arts venues are located.  I started working at Birraporetti's in May, which is the very end of the busy season for most of the Theater District.  It is a very intense, but entertaining place to work, when it is busy.   I live in Montrose, near W. Alabama and Montrose, with roommates, Jason and Oliver.  Most of my free time (whatever that is) is spent with my guitar, my PS2, and my other poor friends who, like me, can't afford to go out very often.  Several of us have taken an interest in Texas Hold Em poker, but mostly play just for fun.   Well, that's the basic picture for now.  Hope it wasn't too boring to read.  I plan on going a little deeper next time, but I needed a starting point.   For those of you who are considering coming to see me at work, I would advise against it.  When I'm working, I usually don't have time to talk, and when I'm not working, I try not to stick around longer than I have to.  But if you must, or if you are going to see a show in the Theater District, call me first (so I can save a table for you).  My work number is (713) 224-9494.   Question for the week:  Why do so many companies (and political candidates) try to sell their products (or win your vote) by emphasizing the negative aspects of the alternative rather than focusing on the benefits of buying their product (or voting for that person)?   Anyone?

      For those of you who don't know, I am the third James Truette Herrington.  Mom and Dad called me Trey until I started kindergarten.  Why I wanted to be called by a different name at such an early age, I'll never know.  This "journal" is for those of you who want to keep up with my constant struggle/journey called "Life".  (I will also be attempting to solve the mysteries of the Universe, but don't hold your breath.)  In December, my life took a dramatic turn, and I know now that it is going to be a long road to recovering.  I'm hoping that putting this all down on "paper" will help with the process.  I also know that several people wonder how I am, since I am hard to get in contact with.  Hopefully, this will help.
