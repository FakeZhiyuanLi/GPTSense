      wow! that was amazing. my ex-bf/friend/obsession/love-of-my-life/torturer recommended it to me. i think he intended for me to view it with him, but i was in a funk today and really wanted to watch it. basically it is about a society that forces its inhabitants to inject themselves with a serum that makes them void of all feeling. well one of the main enforcers of this law goes awol, stops taking the serum, and begins to feel. it's really quite amazing.   anyway- the point to this is i've decided to stop feeling. i know it sounds so melodramatic and selfish- but i hate feeling. my ex- the main reason for this decision- ironically, is the one who recommended it, as i stated before. though i've viewed this film and fully (well as much as i possibly can) absorbed it, i still choose not to feel. (though it is the exact opposite of the message the movie intends to send). i want to feel, i just don't want to feel what is inevitable.

      i was recently asked the other day by someone i was until that very day seeing whether i had been using him. i'm sad to say i kind of laughed- luckily we weren't actually physically speaking to each other. but what made me laugh is that for the past few months i've felt so sorry for myself because i couldn't get over the fact that i had been used by someone i cared for. but the funny thing is that when people are in situations like these ("romantic" relationships) everyone uses everyone. the purpose of those relationships are to feel good. you use the other person, whoever they may be, to feel better about yourself. the reason you stay together and you stay in love through all the shit that may or does happen is because the way they make you feel. you love that feeling, you love the feeling that they give you, so in return, you love them. and hopefully you give them that same kind of feeling.

      i "break up" with someone when i most need someone. i had a post from a while ago, where i just simply stated that i wanted to be held. and it's apparently still true.   i sent myself a text message, intending for someone else to read it. all it said was that i wanted to be kissed. they didn't see it, and i didn't get kissed.   some people are smart. when they want to be held they just find someone. but i always have emotional attachments. i wish i didn't, but i do.   so i'm here alone, talking to two people that i've broken up with. and i know that if i made a move on either of them, i could get what i want. or at least some of what i want. but i want so much more then just sex. i want love, too. and that's my biggest problem.

      "I can see now I never really committed to Laura. I always had one foot out the door, and that prevented me from doing a lot of things, like thinking about my future and... I guess it made more sense to commit to nothing, keep my options open. And that's suicide. By tiny, tiny increments."  -Rob Gordon, High Fidelity
