        Now back to business. Today i will be telling you bout my councillor life after i passed my councillor interviews. Well 4 years for some would be a very long time but to me i felt that time really flies.      Do you know that being a councillor is tough? Though you think that we only go around checking on people, we councillors too have a set of rules that we have to abide to, or else we suffered punishments. Being a councillor really had&nbsp;let&nbsp;me learn a lot of things. Frankly speaking, without student council, I will not be whom i am today. I changed through the years, from a timid, no confidence, not daring to speak in front of the public person to a dare to speak up person. A more confident person perhaps.       &nbsp;   Our batch was also the first batch that went through the six months probation. I can tell you that my first councillors' camp was really really a tough one. Though i could not described in details but i could tell you that you would not like it if you went for the camp. From then on, councillors' camp are like nightmares to me. After the end of the my very first camp, I got my junior badge. That's does not confirm that you are already a councillor. The 6 months probation is still there, anytime you will be sacked. Truthfully, nearing the end of the probation, around four were sacked while two quitted. It was a sad thing&nbsp;you to see&nbsp;your friends leaving the student council. Thus that also marked that the rest remaining had to go for the second&nbsp;camp.&nbsp;Whereas, after that it was the passing over of office from the 18th batch to the 19th batch. Also during the 19th student council investiture, for those who passed the probation got their tie and tie pins from the principal's hands on stage in front of the whole school.     It was an honourable thing.       &nbsp;   I told you time really flies, it was the last camp befor we took over office. I still remembered that camp clashed with my NPCC adventure training camp, that was why i only went for the first day. I regretted doing so, that's the most stupidous thing that i had done during my secondary school years. It cost me a post in the student council. Or at least give me a chance to prove myself that i am fit to be in the main committee. But i didn't have a chance! I remembered that i brought my 8250 handphone to my ATC camp in ubin and hide it under my undergarments to message people in school so as to get the results of the postings. Shocked that i am a member of some committee. Till now that i believed that it was because of not attending the camp that cost me&nbsp;to be a member. I had been consistent so&nbsp;there is no reason why i aren't deserved a post!      Though a member, I really felt that&nbsp;I let&nbsp;myself down when i got a member.&nbsp;I felt that&nbsp;I had no face to go into student council room again. I overcome it eventually, getting encouragements from my peers. Really thanks them a lot for pulling me up. I got very involved with council activities, that's why&nbsp;I love student council so much. I helped the presidents in the printing of docs for the camps. Help in whatever way i could.&nbsp;In the end of my council life, i felt that i had already done my very best&nbsp;and rendered my 110% service to student council&nbsp;so i felt satisfied. I never regret that i join S.C. It was S.C who mould me to whom i am today.      JURONG STUDENT COUNCIL  LEAD WITH HONOUR    &nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

         Date: 21st July'04      Time: 9.27 a.m      Thunders roared, lightning flashed, hugh drops of raindrops shaped like beads splattered on my roof; "Thud! Thud!"       I was left alone at home as both my parents had gone out to attend a wedding dinner.      For me, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;such a great time to be reading a thriller by the fireplace in this kind of atmosphere. I prepared a cup of hot chocolate and placed it on the coffee table so that I could enjoy while reading the thriller. It was indeed a cozy paradise for me.        Thoughts raced through my brains as I read the thriller "WHEN I AM ALONE AT HOME". Questions like "will there be ghosts in the house?" "Will there be any unusual phenomenon happening?"         I tried to push all these thoughts to the back of my mind as I continued reading the thriller. A charm caught my eye halfway through the story. It was a charm that could summon a friend to this world. The Charm goes    "  Alone at home,  &nbsp; Afraid you must,  &nbsp; Summon a friend,  &nbsp; Whom will bring you a smile."         Upon reading finished the charm, the lights in the living room suddenly flickered and went out. The only light that was left was from the burning fireplace. Long shadows of statues and objects cast themselves all over in the house. A sudden loud crash of sound was heard from the basement, it made my whole body jumped. I grabbed a torchlight and slowly made my way down the stairs to the basement. Mumbling of sounds were heard from inside the basement.  "cursed...dumb...why...idiotic"       I    slowly opened the basement door; it creaked like those of a haunted house. My father must had have it not oiled for years. I shone my torchlight across the basement and saw two bear liked ears and I asked,  Who are you? Please come out, I will not hurt you  That creature came out, starting I couldn't see clearly because it was hidden by the shadows cast upon it. To my amazement, it was the rainbow bear from the carebears. After telling me how he landed up here, I apologised to him and told him that it was the charm that I had read that actually caused him to be landed in the basement of my house.        We had really a great time together. Chit chatting, playing board games, telling cold jokes to each others and lots more. When my parents' car drove in, he disappeared suddenly. I found myself in the living room instead of my own bedroom with the rainbow bear, I was lying on the sofa by the fireplace. An unfinished cup of hot chocolate was still left in the same position that I had left it there moments ago.  Is it a dream? Or is it real at all? &nbsp;I found my answer when I saw the rainbow badge that was pinned on my pyjamas.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

        LEAD WITH HONOUR    is the motto of my school's student council.         &nbsp;    I was nominated by my teachers to go for the councillors' interview at the end of Sec One. It was the first time i actually went for&nbsp;the interview. I was very nervous then. Firstly being interviewed by the seniors in the hall. I was holding very very tight to the stand of the two desks while answering&nbsp;their questions. I didn't expect myself to get through the first interview because i felt that i busted the whole interview. Hahahaha. I got through anyway. The second interview was much more tough, this time i went out of it with a very disappointed look because during the interview..........................     The DM actually asked:  "Think of 6 people in this room that is not suitable to be a councillor."      A lot of them chose me because of my personality at that time, they knew me as a shy and lacked of confidence person. I myself also chose myself la. That was why i am sad at myself too. The results came out not long after our end of year examination.&nbsp;Guess wat? I actually got in!&nbsp;I was&nbsp;one of the six students chosen in our class.&nbsp;3 males and 3 females.      That's when i&nbsp;started my secondary school life as a student councillor.  &nbsp;

        YOzZZzz. As you all have read, i stopped at my primary school life. Now i will continue on with my secondary school life. Hope all of you who read this post will enjoy the jokes and story that i have written.        &nbsp;    Well, i start on with the announcement of the PSLE results. The day that i got my results, i was very devastated by the fact that i scored lower than my mid years and prelims. I actually got 251 during mid year but dropped to 240 in my prelims though i still topped my class with another girl and got my trip to Malacca for being the top in my class. But i got 237 for my PSLE. I cried when i got my results. Most of my classmates also cried. The atmosphere in my class was very sad that day even though some scored quite well. I got into my third choice which is The jews were in the wrong -&nbsp;Jurong. My first choice was the wealth is too common - Commonwealth and my second choice is the cottage in swiss - Swiss Cottage. But i didn't get in due to my poor results.        &nbsp;    Thus that's marked the end of my primary school life and marked the beginning of my secondary school life. Lots of memories were usually remembered by most students on the first day of school because they usually were engraved deep into our minds and often were brought in in our conversations when we have class gatherings.       I felt very awkward for the fact that it was my first time wearing a tuck out uniform. I was wondering if i&nbsp;was supposed to tucked my uniform in or whatsoever. Do u believed that i actually tucked my uniform in!? But found it weird&nbsp;so i tucked out again. Hahahaha.... when i reached school i saw that most students had their uniform tucked out soothed my awkwardness. I found a new friend soon after my form teacher arranged our seats. She left a very deep impression of herself in me because she took the initiative to introduce herslf to me. Can u believe that a girl actually did that? I was taken surprised by her act but we&nbsp;became&nbsp;very good friends then. I made a lot of very good friends in my class like Candy(e girl whu intro herself to me), wendy liew(blur sotong), Irenes(one pile pile of shit), Kareen(the curry urn), Wanwei(elephant), Wen jie(pig), Qing Lin(cheng Teng), Caiyan(jelly), Cai Ping(apple jie), Gang Yi(Boss), Kang Wei(underwear Wei), Jing Boon(baboon, san chun jing lian), and many many others.        &nbsp;   Of cos, every class pupils will have themselves painted as the black sheep of the class (hey i had ans Andrew's questions). Naughty pupils of cos, mostly being influenced by the bad people whom were initially bad. They were really brought down the reputation of our class and created a lot of problems but i think that they had learnt their lessons now for their acts they had done at that time. But i was really lucky to have so many kind, caring and responsible teachers through my primary school as well as my sec. sch. Ms Zoey Oh, my sec 1 form teacher and the bubbly cute teacher i had in my sec 2, Ms Jasmine Owyong (&nbsp;a really very nice teacher), love her so much. We had a guinea pig called rambo during sec 2 but died after a few months in the month of the june holidays.&nbsp; We cried and buried it near the eco pond in our school. It died on the way to the vet in a taxi. The vet said it was infected by germs in its stomach. It was a sad day for my class 2/4.       &nbsp;     &nbsp;

      Hi, my name is known as xiao mian yang or you can call me little bother lim. This is the first time i create a blog of my own. hope viewers will like it. Well i will talk about myself as you know its my blog anyway. Firstly i would like to begin with my primary school. I was enrolled into Rulang Primary School when i graduated from K2. I had have several good or rather very caring form teachers throughout my primary school life.For primary one and two, i had this sweet malay form teacher named Miss Hani, whom later joined a insurance company called AIA. Then during primary 3 and 4, my form teacher was Mrs Magaret Lai. She was one of the teachers whom had left me the deepest impression because she was so caring that when i was promoted to primary 5, i told her about the bad results that i had scored for my exams. She actually was very concerned that she offered to help me get a tutor but at that time, i already had a personal tutor. Subsequently, she left Rulang and join greenridge where i heard nothing from her anymore. When i reached primary six, i had a "wonderful" teacher whom you could said you either hate her or like her, but do we had a choice. She had high expectations of our class, i can said without her, i don't think i could get such a fabulous results when the PSLE results was annouced. I got 237 which was quite good in my class at that time. Thanks to her. Frankly speaking, my life in primary school was not at all fun and interesting at all, basically, i was insulted by few of my friends that i am a sissy and whatsoever, its not pleasant at all. Just because that i mixed with girls most of my time and eventually now that i knew girls better than some of the guys you know. Easily click in with the girls la. I had a few best friends during the primary schools years, some are Xiao yun, hajah, sum kar leong, li hui 6L, Andrea, and lots of them. I also got my first trophy at the last year of my primary school sports day, when i took part in the 400m B Boys. Surprised though i got in first. If not for the malay guy from yellow house, he sprained his leg or ankle or whatever, he could easily beaten me and ran away with the champion while i will get home a silver trophy instead of a golden one. haha, lucky me, i would say.
