      Not only is that the title of one of John Candy's last movies (which by the way I've never seen....so I cant comment on how good or bad it is), but it also entails the start of my journey to the east coast.  I'm leaving mid-MO (my home of 6 years) and the show-me-state itself (my home of 24 years).  My departure is in roughly 4-5 hours.  To those of you who I've seen in the past couple days and didn't get to say goodbye to, I'm sorry.  And for others who I saw before I left....just remember that i'll be back in September-October.  You better believe that i'm taking some of that midwest SWANG out to the sandy beaches and surfer dudes on the coast.  Nick, I'll go scope out some of them...and send some pictures to you.  Only spikey blonde hair ones...I know.  I read ya.  Well...I bid you adieu.  It's gonna be a few days until I get there and get everything hooked up and running again.  Until then...take care everyone, and dont forget to smile.  I can't tell you for sure if I'm smiling about my trip....but I'm gonna try it anyway.  East coast here I come.  Zing!

      ....when Derek's writing it, of course.    HaaaaHA!  You actually thought I had a formal pronounced definition for blog?  Think again.  It's an enigma, one which doesn't quite produce enough thinking on behalf of a person to merit a definition.  You probably don't really think about it, b/c "blog" just sounds so damn cool.  It also helps when I produce a blog, b/c as stated earlier....a blog isn't really a blog until Derek writes one.  (My apologies to Rob Crow).  Actually you see...the point of this paragraph is to take up space.  That's right, I really have nothing at the moment...outside of a small dash of writer's block.  But I tell ya...all this "blog" talk....I'd be the happiest person in the world if that did it for me.  We progress....onto the news.  I finished packing up a bit of stuff today for my venture out to the east coast.  I'm leaving Sunday afternoon....so it's getting down to the wire.  Also ran some errands....trying to get everything in order for the move.  Still though, I'm not sure I know what the heck i'm doing.  We ate a little din-din at Chili's, where Jason discovered his future haircut, via a very hispanic-looking busser.  Nothing big after dinner...as all of us went home to our respective shanties.  I sat down and watched part of movie with Jason and Coz...then sat outside for a bit, gazing at the sky.  Couldn't really get much out of it, b/c it's been overcast all day today.  But I saw enough to know that I can actually still map the sky.  And now I sit here in front of you.  My fantastic writings are telling the story...so baby, you better be listening.  I'm spent people.  That's pretty sad...its not even 11pm, and I'm spent.  But I really have nothing further to discuss...at least not from today.  I figure I can pop in a movie and fall asleep on my mattress, which now sits on the floor (seeing as how my bed has been taken apart).  I might be an oddball...but I find peace in it. And considering recent events, peace is a hard thing to come by.  I cherish every bit of it I can find.  I suggest you do the same.  Good night to those of you who are actually listening.  I hope all is well with you and yours.

      Here I am....wondering what to do at 12:20am.  After looking at Rob Crow's profile page....I decided that perhaps I should start a blog/journal type thing up again.  It will help all of you understand what's going on with me....and to let you all in on what's going on in my life.  It will be good for all of us, I'm sure.  Comments and replies are most welcome.  Now that I've started this thing, my mind is naturally at a loss for words.  I'm drawing many blanks, which is actually pretty typical of me lately.  So...give me a day to figure this stuff out, decipher what to write about....and I'll get back to ya.   Music  :  Flaw - Recognize

      Well I just got home from seeing The Village, and let me tell ya...it was quite an experience.  No, I'm not talking about the movie....I thought the movie was really bad.  I've never been in a theatre where so many people talked and so many were laughing.  Nobody would shut up...and it didn't help that I sat right in front of an ENTIRE ROW of high school girls.  They would run amuck, with their little giggling and mocking of the "shhh" noises around the theatre.  I really wanted to just stand up and slap each and every one of them to high hell.  However, I stowed my hopes of fury when a very large black woman (2 seats down from me) turned about and balled up a fist...and told them collectively to "shut yo mouths before I make ya'll".  Her husband seemed to agree, b/c he was laughing as I was.  As for the movie...I was quite disappointed.  I knew it wasn't going to be as good as Signs or even the Sixth sense, but I was really really let down.  It wasn't frightening at all, and the couple parts where everyone did happen to jump....you knew it was coming.  I'm not going to give anything away....but the whole premise of the movie was a little weak for me, as was the ending.  However, the girl that played the main character Ivy....I thought she did a great job.  As far as I know, it was her film debut.  It also didn't hurt that she was quite beautiful....it made watching this movie bearable for the 2 hours I was in there.  Well, I've done it.  I've become a blogger-movie reviewer.  Obligatory thanks go to the one...the only.....Evan Onstot, who I'm sure will have his 2 cents to say about the movie tomorrow.  Would I recommend seeing it?  No...it's not nearly as good as Shyamalan's other movies.  In fact, it was rather boring.  But...I've definately seen worse.  The movie will still make a killing at the box office, b/c that's the way of things.  You'll either like it or you won't.  I really didn't.  On the plus side, I saw the new Batman preview.  Awesome.  Night.

      Friday night....what did I do?  Well, not much of anything to tell you the truth.  I was here at home, re-arranging the place for a good portion of the evening.  Doing alot of cleaning and moving.  It was no different than any other day....7 kids in a house at some point during the day.  I wanted to go see either The Village or the Manchurain Candidate tonight, but that didn't happen.  I'm for sure going to go at least see one of them tomorrow.  Hell, I haven't even went to see the Bourne Supremacy yet, which is odd.  When new movies come out, I'm usually on the ball about seeing them.  I guess it's not the same anymore...I never have anyone to go with.  And if I do, there are always little kids around.  It's quite the change in lifestyle, as compared to 6 months ago.  I miss it more than I would have ever thought I could.   Coincidence?   John Kerry....Gomer Pile.  Relation?  Coincidence?  You be the judge.   urlLink     ....still waitin' on the phone call to change my life....  Alone?  Yeah, it's a safe bet.  G'night.

       urlLink      Satisfaction, it seems, doesn't come easily...nor does it come w/o a lenghty pricetag.&nbsp; I think too often people are striving to have something...some arrangement in their minds...that is beyond what they would consider reachable in any normal circumstance.&nbsp; The people that are easily satisfied really don't know how easy they have it sometimes.&nbsp; Myself?&nbsp; I'm not easily satisfied.&nbsp; As much as I have in this life so far...something is missing.&nbsp; As much as I've went through to get to this point....something's still missing.&nbsp; It's easy for me to sit here and write about it...but I'm sure it's another thing for you all to sit out there and read about it...trying to understand how I'm feeling.&nbsp; I guess I'll leave it to those who read this to understand the details and formalities of which I speak.&nbsp; Man...that sounded REALLY good, didn't it?&nbsp; Enough of the serious shit!

      &nbsp;  urlLink     Ahh yes, politics. It's nice to know that President Bush cares about the little things...even if it's reading upside down books. Now...I've never pretended to know much about politics. This is probably due to the fact that I really don't follow any of it, and I'm a little un-informed when it comes to the values of each candidate. However, I do know that this is election year, and that those nice little debates and conventions will be popping up on a television set near you. I'll also tell you that I don't really hate any candidate, nor do I especially like any candidate...b/c I just do not know enough about it to care. Now is the president as clueless as he appears in this picture? Well, I'm sure we'd get a different opinion from everybody in that regard. But honestly, not much is worse than John Kerry's first pitch at Fenway Park in Boston the other night. It was pitiful...he didn't even get it to the plate. Not only that, but he wasn't even on the mound properly. I caught in the news that when Bush was running, he stood elegantly on the mound in Yankee Stadium...and fired a strike right down the middle. John boy, you just lost it. You now have no chance to be president. You can't even throw a strike. The people in Boston can verify that...as seen when they booed you on the mound. Am I sounding all political now? It tickles me funny bone, aye....it does. Yeah, I'll stop....I really got nothin.  Guess what?&nbsp; It rained all day again.&nbsp; Thunderstorms are in the forecast for the next 2 days.&nbsp; I'm actually feeling quite under the weather, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; Sure ya do...I'm exhausted, my neck hurts, headaches, and a fever of 101.&nbsp; I really don't know why I'm not asleep yet.&nbsp; You should feel privileged that I'm sacrificing resting time to write in my blog.&nbsp; I do it for you...I do it for the people.&nbsp; People need to be informed damnit!&nbsp; Roll with me here.

      &nbsp;  urlLink      So in the typical summer where baseball rules the headlines and steals the show...it's once again Lance Armstrong who takes the spotlight. He just won his 6th straight Tour de France, which is just outright amazing. It's even more amazing, considering the fact that he's overcome cancer to get to this position. It's even more-so amazing because of all the scrutiny he has to go through over there, with all the French media and hoop-la and what not. Listen...I don't care if you're French, and you simply just hate America and everything it stands for. You can't fault him for being an American. I don't see how you can't root for a guy that has gone through what he has. You're probably never going to see such dominance again....I mean, the man is exceptional at what he does. The papers say that he's mulling the fact whether or not to return for a 7th year and try it again. Let's hope the criticism he's getting doesn't prevent him from going back there next year...and kicking their asses again.   It's raining here AGAIN today.&nbsp; It rained all night.&nbsp; It rains every other day....and I'm not just talking about the typical sprinkle.&nbsp; These are mass thunderstorms.&nbsp; I'm starting to believe that I brought some type of midwestern wrath here with me to the east coast.&nbsp; It's on the verge of becoming ridiculous, if not already so.&nbsp; What is it like when it's not raining?&nbsp; It's mid-90's...usually with the heat index, around or over 100.   On tap for today is a full day of reading/studying for the real estate course I'm taking.&nbsp; I have a practice exam tomorrow, so here's to me doing well.&nbsp; A good score would indicate just where I'm at in terms of passing the real exam.&nbsp; I'm also hoping to go see The Bourne Supremacy this evening.&nbsp; I've been meaning to do that the past 2 days, but just haven't done it for whatever reason.&nbsp; My aunt Kathy and uncle Ruben are here visiting for a week or so, which is great news.&nbsp; Too bad Ruben couldn't bring all his plasma TV's so that I may watch them.&nbsp; It's always good to see them...I wish I could see more of them.&nbsp; It should be a fun week, provided that the rain doesn't overwhelm the visit.   That's all I got people.&nbsp; Enjoy today.

      So why am i posting in my blog at 7:30am on a Saturday morning?&nbsp; I'm trying to ask myself the same question, but an answer really doesn't seem to be coming from anywhere.&nbsp; It could be due to the fact that there were 3 children in this house last night (as there have been the last 4 nights).&nbsp; Oh dont worry, they are not mine.&nbsp; No no, that would be bad at this juncture.&nbsp; They are my cousin Erica's kids.&nbsp; Noah says hello....he's a hellion.&nbsp; Not only that...but apparently the dog "let loose" on the kitchen floor at some point during the night.&nbsp; Such a wonderful sight to wake up to...especially when you're blind like I am w/o my contacts.       My'>http://www.readingforresults.com/rating/r.jpg">  My  life is rated R.   urlLink What  is your life rated?     That's right....that's my life.&nbsp; Rated "R" baby.&nbsp; I took the test from Evan's blog, whose life I mind you, is rated "NC-17".&nbsp; As he so eloquently pointed out, its probably due to the vast sexual partners he has had.&nbsp; I wouldn't deny this, and I'm sure a select few of others would also happen to uphold the statement.&nbsp; It's the little things really...things we sometimes don't think about.&nbsp; I'm sure there are some great stories yet to be told...ones which ride the back burner until they are brought up (either by accident or purpose).&nbsp; Speaking of stories...if you fancy a good one, you should check out my profile (on the right margin) and read up on Brutus, the bald frog.&nbsp; It might&nbsp;tickle you in ways that you never thought possible.   I've become quite the coffee person now.&nbsp; I've never tried those Frapuccino's before...but I'm drinking one now, and its pretty good.&nbsp; I also had never walked into a Starbucks until I moved out here.&nbsp; Now I realize what people always meant when they said that there is a Starbucks at every corner.&nbsp; It seems to be that way, but for some reason...that case wasn't true in MO.&nbsp; Well, I can't say for certain whether that's the case in St. Louis, b/c I dont really know.&nbsp; But who cares about St. Louis?&nbsp; Poo on that.   My random-ness, it seems,&nbsp;is coming to an end.&nbsp; Everyone needs advice from time to time...so I'm more than obliged to leave you with a bit of my own.&nbsp; If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too...because come on, life is funny.   You know you love this.&nbsp; Peace.&nbsp;

      For avid readers of this page....and for those of you who know me, you would know that I try to use this page as an escape.  It's a way to tell people about what's going on.  I've always been better at writing my thoughts down, and I see this as a good way to do it.  I try to make it as funny as possible, and still tell everyone a bit about my not-so-ordinary life.  I'd like to think that I succeed in that department.....solely on the responses I get and the discussions I seem to cause from time to time.  I'm souped up on Nyquil, it's late....and the after-effects of Hurricane Charley are probably playing with my mind.  So, please forgive me if this post veers away from the norm.  Not that I need a reason to back it all up....nor do I even need to apologize for it.  But....to each his own.  .... What makes a person?   Is it based on the fact of whether or not they can  play Missouri football???   Seriously I mean, you look at people....you know them, watch what they do.  You think you read them, know what they're thinking (especially people you've known for years).  But what truly makes a person?  Is it their goals in life?  Compassion for others?  Occupation or career?  Money...possessions?  Family...friends...love?  Or could it be a number of those things?  And even then....do you know if that person is truly happy by doing what they think is right?  It boils down to what they think....and not what you think.  I often think about why we waste so much time worrying and trying to figure out what others want....when we can't even sit down and enjoy what exactly it is that we do ourselves.  We've all been taught to not worry about what others think.  Ya know, live your own life....take risks, do what's right....and everything will turn out OK in the end.  You take the good, you take the bad....but in the end, the 5 seconds of good in a situation will win out.  Why?  Because we all instinctly know that happiness is worth it.  Peace and understanding is what it's all about.  In whatever we do, we always want to be happy.  Whether we realize it at the time or not....it's what we strive for.  We strive to live.....or survive, in other words.  It's the same with any living creature....you fight to survive.  Who is to say that happiness and survival aren't the same thing?  That they don't go along in the same boat?  One could say "selfishness" also goes along the same lines.  To be happy, at times a person has to be selfish....no matter what pain it causes to that person or to whatever expense it might bring upon another.  Does that make you less of a person?  Sit down and think about it.   Friendship.  Love.  Compassion.   We all hear these words.  Do we know what they mean?  Well....I'm here to tell you that some people don't.  They don't have the faintest clue of what they mean.  Not even a concept.  Each one of these words symbolizes something that everyone in this world should have.  They're not to be played with, joked with, or EVER lied about.  On the flip side....they are not to be taken lightly.  You never want to take anything for granted, because I can tell you from personal experience....NOTHING should be taken for granted.  You don't live life just to live it and get by without concern for others in your life.  You should live life to the fullest and with the greatest concern of others in your life.  People are in your life for a reason.  Don't over-look that reason.  Don't abuse it....don't neglect it....because the next day it could be gone.  People make mistakes when it comes to this.  They just don't realize it.  Often times, it's too late before they can realize it.  And more often than not....you not only hurt others around you, but you hurt yourself even more.  Second chances are given with sometimes the greatest of contempt and fear....yet at other times with supreme compassion.  It's in those times that you come to find what kind of a person you truly are.  When I say fear....it's not about the fear of having....or even the fear of doing.  It's about the fear of having  not  done.  Sometimes what we don't do can be the worst mistake of all.  The hard part is realizing it.   Cause and effect.   Action and reaction.  Choice and consequence.  They all go hand-in-hand.  Birds of a feather flock together, we always say.  Everything we do has some horror to it.  It doesn't matter if we do it to be happy....or even just to survive.  The bottom line is....there is something more that goes along with anything we ever say, do, choose, or make.  Something beneath the surface.  More often than not....it's something we cannot see, until it is brought to our attention.  The problem is.....some people choose to ignore these little "something's".  Why?  Do they have a reason....or do they just not realize it?  Do they do it still knowing that they could be hurting the people they care about?  You might know a person for years....and STILL not know the answer to those questions.  It doesn't mean you're blind.  You're not "out-of-the-loop".  It just goes to show that maybe you don't know that person well enough.  It goes to show that maybe you took them for granted.  Nobody can read minds (my apologies to the famous black psychic woman from TV).  If we could read minds....it would solve a lot of problems, and yet might end up causing even more.  So we're stuck asking ourselves the same damn question.  What really makes a person?  As Derek once said to Nick, when asked why it was snowing in Arizona...... .....I haven't the foggiest.

Links here......links there......links everywhere. Roll with'em.  Have you ever seen a  urlLink narcoleptic dog ? You have now.  Do you know how to properly  urlLink fold a shirt ? You have now.  Have you ever seen Saddam Hussein partake in a friendly game of  urlLink rock, paper, scissors ? You have now.  Do you know what a  urlLink butt-plug  really is? You do now.

       urlLink    Other than the close circle of friends....most people aren't going to know who this is, or what this picture symbolizes.  For those of you who DO know what this is all about....please save your applause and utter exuberance until after completion of this entry.  Please...everyone welcome back the one and only "BigBBFan".  Yes, after all these years....somehow....someway....by the STROKE of GOD himself do I still have this pic on my computer.  I was browsing through random files in the deepest, darkest parts of my computer hard drive, and I found a file that I couldn't believe still existed.  The file in question is the one you're looking at now!  This is legend.  This is a pure nostalgia.  The legend of BigBBFan reverberates throughout the grizzled veteran world to this day.  The man who had the audacity to post himself with his family....and on a public internet college basketball message board, no less.  BigBBFan was as dumb as they come, but he held himself in such high regard when it concerned his Kansas Jayhawks.  The 45 year old man who would spend his day fighting (immaturely and unsuccessfully, I might add) with numerous college guys over the intricacies and innuendos of the college basketball world.  He was "Sdoyel's" right-hand man.  He was "bigballer's" left-hand man.  He was Roy Williams' right ass cheek.  He was Kenny Gregory's bitch.  However, above all else....he was committed to making our day.  This is a tribute to you.  Enjoy it.  Relish it.  We love you, BigBBFan....and we thank you.  Legend.  Nostalgia.  Grizzle.

       urlLink    So I was looking through some old photos I have here on the computer....and it got me thinking about the golden days.  Ahhh yes, the days when boys were boys and college men were not quite men.  The years past, when everything seemed like it would last forever....and that nothing could possibly be more fun than those times were.  Road trips....baseball games....drinking games....and talking to an ice cream bar, like yours truly is doing here.  Good times.  At times of boredom, or when my mind doesn't come up with valid material to write....I think I shall post more pictures of old.  It spices things up a bit.  Refreshing.  Something new.  It also might scare some of you, for you probably don't have any clue of what pictures I may have on here!  But don't fret, nothing too embarassing will make it on here.  Derek promises.  Aye, so he does.  That's all I got people.  Have a pleasant evening, if'n it do ya fine.

       urlLink    Man (Michael, that is...spelled Mann)...what a movie!  I've yet to notice how great of a film maker Michael Mann is.  Evan, why did you not open my eyes up to this sooner?!?  " Heat"  was awesome, and " The Insider"  was just as great....but this movie was pretty bad-ass.  I have to take my hats off to Mr. Cruise.  Whether he's playing the #1 bartender in the world, or the #1 race driver in a sport, or the #1 pool player, or even the last samurai....he pulls it off quite nicely.  And now, he plays the role of being the #1 hitman in the world....and it's great.  The camera shots in the movie just take your mind and makes it think.  The way every scene is ran, or every dialogue is constructed....it all has a purpose.  Not much is known about the people that Cruise has been hired to kill, but it all unfolds as the movie goes.  On top of all of that, I thought the soundtrack was excellent.  The music went very well with the movie.  Jamie Foxx has a breakout role.  The movie's got some comedy to it, and Foxx plays it very well.  Between this movie, and the upcoming life story of Ray Charles ("Ray"), Foxx looks to be on the high track.   I'm sure not everybody is going to like this movie, but I personally enjoyed it.  It's just one of those really cool movies.  It just depends on what your version of cool really is, I guess.  It's definately no chick-flick.  But I suppose if the ladies like to watch Tommy boy get his groove on (in whatever situation), then the more power to them.

      Now, you might be asking yourself why I'm awake and posting in a blog at 3:30 am. Also...you might be wondering why I took the time to write up a fake movie and still act as if it made any sense. And since everyone is so curious, I should disclose that I'm asking myself a question of my own....why does anyone really give a shit?!? :)  You're laughin'. I'm smilin'. Victory is mine!

       urlLink    From out of nowhere, the news has broken of the recently filmed sequel to Cast Away, entitled "The Cowbell Conspiracy". Tom Hanks will be reprising his role as the Fed-Ex guru Chuck Noland, the plane crash survivor who discovered a knack for crab meat and learned the intricacies of talking to a volleyball. Teaming up along side Hanks is Helen Hunt, who played Noland's love interest in the first movie. Added to the cast this time around is Robert De Niro, who plays along side Hunt in her quest for redemption, and the immortal Christopher Walken, who was cast to play the vengeful time-cop.  Details on the plot are still very much in the dark, but rumor has it that Hanks' character sets back out to sea in search of his island home. Anger, confusion, and utter disappointment surround Noland's loved ones, in particular Hunt, who vows to sail out with an all-star team of sailors led by Captain Blue (De Niro) to retrieve Noland and discover the reason behind his actions. However, their journey quickly turns sour when storms rage, icebergs abound, and a sudden re-appearance of scurvy plagues the crew. Little does everyone know, that De Niro's character "Blue" is actually an undercover agent working for the Bush administration. Why is he on the boat? What is he looking for? It has been leaked to us that Walken's character appears through a time-portal over the open sea. He intersects Blue's crew and tells of his quest for an ancient cowbell relic which holds unheralded influence and power. He's brought with him a vast army, one which may hold the secret behind Noland's return to the remote island....and the details surrounding a possible presidential conspiracy!  "The Cowbell Conspiracy" will hit theaters this December.  Be prepared!

      I've always said that people are stupid.  Of course....I'm not putting ALL people in that category, because certainly there are some very well educated people out there.  I'm just using the "people are stupid" comment as a generalization.  You run into stupid people wherever you go and in whatever you do.  It's uncontrollable.  You cannot do anything about it.  They will be there, in all of their idiotic existence.  Am I posting this because of Evan's recent stupid, yet  oh so lucky  actions?  No, not really....b/c it's a given that Evan doesn't have the attention to detail that normal people do.  Sorry my friend.  On the contrary, I'm posting all of this because of what I ran into today.  I progress.....  For those of you unaware, I'm in the process of taking a real-estate course to acquire myself a job of mass proportions.  The final is on Friday....today was a bit of review, but mostly MATH.  That's all we did for 3 and a half hours....we reviewed and covered real estate math.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a math wizard.  But this stuff isn't hard.  It's basic stuff.  Wait, let me re-phrase that....it's beyond BEFORE the most Basic, if there is such a thing.  I like to make conversation and talk to the people next to me....but my encounter today wanted me to run to high heaven and never come out.  I shouldn't be surprised by the stupidity of people....but for some reason (whether it be from the stress I've been under for awhile or not), I couldn't handle it today.  Here is the story of Laqueesha.  Laqueesha is a proud woman, and from what I can tell....I'm guessing early to mid 30's.  She's a bit on the chunky side, and she has a booming voice.  Her dress code is less than casual, if I must describe it.  A big, hip, fly, flaunty, loud, and very proud african american woman.  She's a sista girl, aka "sexual chocolate".  There's no denying it.....you know the type of woman I'm describing.  You feel intimidated.  If she sits next to you and talks to you....you better talk back, or you're liable to get a smack up side yo' head.  You have a vision of her in your heads now?  Good....because here comes the main event.  We started with the basic math.  This included fractions and decimals.  You know....2/7 or 3/6.  Numerator divided by denominator.  We flew through the first page, because obviously any adult would know how to do this stuff.  Oh...but not Laqueesha.  Mmmmmm mnh!  She raised her hand, had the teacher explain it to her and we moved on.  I'm on the next page working through my problems, when she turns to me and is still dumbstruck about the fractions.  I asked her politely what she didn't understand.  She didn't understand how we got 0.25.  I told her you take the fraction "1/4" and divide 1 by 4.  Five minutes later she turns back to me and says, "Ohh yaa I think I got it!"  Well....save the lord Jesus christ, it's a miracle.  I tried to show her how easy it was, and that's when she responded with, "Ohh yeah I can do dis stuff.  Dis stuff we done in like high school, right?"  I smiled meticulously and told her I had actually learned it in 3rd grade like most people on god's earth.  She says, "Well it all da same man."  Where I come from, I'm pretty sure that 3rd grade and high school is not the same education level....but then again, Laqueesha is not normal.  We then went onto to multiplication and a couple formulas.  It was a simple matter of substituting numbers into an equation.  At that time, I was horror-struck at the possibility that Laqueesha would bombard me with more questions.  To my utter terror, that's exactly what happened....  The first we went over was AREA.  The simple formula of A=length X width.  I could give this formula to my cousin Patric, who is almost 10 years old.  He could answer the problem, explain HOW he got TO his answer, and then take a shit on it for good measure.  Laqueesha, on the other hand, didn't know where to begin.  The instructor even gave a petty example on the board of 10' by 5'.  Namely, 10 X 5.  What does that equal?  Don't ask Laqueesha.  Laqueesha don' know!  Laqueesha be holdin' up da whole class cuz she don' know!  The instructor moves on, b/c he cannot waste his time.  Who does she turn to for answers?  Who else but Derek.  I show her how to do it on the calculator, and I punch the numbers in for her.  I do everything I can, and I give back her calculator and I give her an example of my own.  I ask what the area would be of a lot 12' X 12'.  Naturally, the answer is 144.  Laqueesha kept getting 24.  "Man you trippin' cuz I don' get dat answer you gave me.  I punchin' it in just like you said to.  Twelve times Twelve equals 24."  I'm watching her as she does this, and it occurs to me (as it would to ANYBODY with a brain) that she is pushing to the "plus" sign.  What's sad is....she thinks she's pushing the multiply sign.  I explain nicely, "Oh, no see...you're pushing the wrong button.  It's this one instead."  Placing blame, she says, "Ohhh see, it's these damn machines.  I can't work no calculator....too dam' confuuzin'."  Tired of holding it in....I puked all over myself.  No, I didn't really puke.  But I was close.  The entire class went on like this.  Laqueesha bombarded me with questions on anything and everything.  During our first break, she actually decided to start up some small talk....because apparently she appreciated all my help, and she felt I was an easy person to talk to.  I couldn't agree more.  I told her I had just moved out here...I had graduated college in 2002, and i'm taking this class so I can get a career going.  It was a good conversation.....that is, until she started up.  She explained to me how she was married, how she had 2 kids, and how she also went to college.  How she also went to college.  How she also went to college.  HOW SHE ALSO WENT TO COLLEGE!   HOW SHE ALSO WENT TO COLLEGE!!      .....  has it registered yet?  When she broke the news, I told her to excuse me....I had to go to the bathroom.  I felt my stomach aching to burst from my chest because of the extreme pain it was under.  Laughter...mixed with pain, horror, and anger (with a little dash of cruelty) can do that to ya.    HOW SHE ALSO WENT TO COLLEGE!!!     ....sorry for the length of this.  People are stupid.  My point is proven.  If you're wondering what the outcome of her college career was....twas a community college here in Virginia.  She graduated with an associates degree.  I'm not sure how this happened, but you can sho' bet dat Laqueesha wuz a wiz in da math.  She sure impressed me.

       urlLink    Seriously. Have you ever felt like the little dog? I certainly have, and I'm sure at some point in everyone's life....they have too. I'd be lying if I told you that I wasn't the little dog right now in my life. The big dog chasing me really isn't any person or any one thing in particular....it's just a collection of things/people. Rest assured however, this little dog has a big bite....and is not about to roll over. Oh no! Big dog best watch his balls, mmmm hmmm....  Now that I have everyone off guard and stunned, let me tell you what I plan on doing with the rest of this blog entry.....  Abso-fuckin-lutely nothing. HaaaHA! Crazy.

      Here I sit in the midst of a flood warning....and what is to be torrential downpour during the late hours and on into tomorrow. Tropical storm Alex is on course to tear up the North Carolina and southern VA shores tomorrow morning/afternoon. Now, I've been in a hurricane out here before (7 years ago?), so I'm not overly excited about what's to come. I mean....it could be worse, right? But what ticks me off is the fact that it has rained every other day (if not every day) since I've been out here. And now with hurricane season on the verge of becoming a reality, it's almost certain that the wet season will continue. Ugh. Hold me.  If you're like me....then you tend to over-react in some situations in which you shouldn't. It's just human nature for some people to act that way. As I was browsing the internet, I was looking through some stories to post...and this one caught my attention. Not because of the brutality or even hilarity of it....but because it proves my point as to how utterly STUPID people can be at times.  urlLink This guy  went too far, my friends. Pay close attention to the man's name. It fits quite nicely. No pun intended, of course.  Here's a random question.....What is it about life that makes you want to question everything you've ever done? Is it just an inherent human emotion to second-guess, or does it exist strictly on a personal level (meaning every person is different)? I find it difficult not to question what's happened in the past. It's not b/c I'm negative about it (although I used to be)....it's just b/c I believe a person's choices are what ultimately shape a life. Choices, rather than god-given talents or abilities, make our lives what they are. Sometimes these choices are given to us, and we don't have much say in them. However in other situations, the choices are indeed made by us....knowingly and whole-heartedly. It is in these decisions that we entrust our futures to. Some decisions may seem good at the time that we make them....but they can often turn out to be the worst decisions of one's life. And it's not always what we decide to do....but rather, what we DON'T decide to do that really hurts in the long run. What we give up. What we choose not to have. And all the same....when we don't realize what we have when we do give it up. Is there an underlying message here? Something to take from this blabber that I find myself writing about? Well....to each his own I guess. But if you're reading this with a clear and thoughtful mind (which I hope most everyone is)....don't say I didn't tell ya so. I just did.  Now let me ask you this....have you ever been asked by a 3-year old, in a public restaurant....after being denied by his mother, to "take him poop"? Yeah, I didn't think so! You don't have anything on me.  Peace out.

And plus, it goes along with the running theme of my last few entries. You might get a laugh or two. Test your skills  urlLink HERE  people.  I even added a web counter.

       urlLink     I know I'm a little behind here, considering it's taken me a couple weeks to see this one. Nevertheless....this one is worth the price of admission. It's awesome. It's a tough call between this one and the first one, but I'm going with this one...simply b/c it takes the story further, and you learn more about the trilogy (yes...a 3rd movie is upcoming). The end car chase in this movie was great....I haven't seen one that good in quite some time, if ever. They took what worked in the first movie and built on it....and Evan is right about the phone conversation while Bourne is on the roof with the scoped rifle. It is quite good.  All that being said, I'm actually thinking about checking out the novels. I mean, dont get me wrong...I liked the first movie. It just didn't grab my attention in the way that this sequel did. It took the story farther than I thought it would, and now I find myself eagerly waiting for the 3rd movie to eventually come out. There's a bigger story that goes along with the plot of the movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it all plays out in the end. Props also go out to Mr. Damon....he rocks. I don't think any other person could play this role as good as he has. I'm not kidding either...I now want to be Jason Bourne. But if it's ok with all of you, I'll keep my first name. Derek Bourne. Chilling yet provacative, isn't it? Yes. Very.  I bet you're thinking....jeez, I have to read Evan's movie critic blog and now I'm reading Derek's as well. I have one thing to say people....live with it. It's what we do. Blog it up.
