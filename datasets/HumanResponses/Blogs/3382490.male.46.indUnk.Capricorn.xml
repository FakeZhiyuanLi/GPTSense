      I shall Blog! THAT is the answer.  I think the first blog I ever read was  urlLink  Mark Evanier  's excellent POV.  I always thought of it as just a website that was "constantly updated".  Didn't really understand the dynamics behind blogging.  But now, of course, EVERYONE blogs.  People who read blogs and have their own blog, list other blogs on their site.  There seems to be a huge blog network, of bloggers blogging, people reading blogs, bloggers advertising other bloggers blogs and bloggers blogging about other bloggers blogs.  I shall Blog too!  I shall also stop using the word blog now.  I promise.

      I just turned 46 last month.  I've discovered that once you reach a certain age, one year isn't really any more special than any other.  Parts of me feel like I'm 27.  Other parts feel like I'm 34.  Still other parts of me feel like they are 16.  The older I get, the more I tend to "hang on" to the parts that feel much younger.  At this rate, when I reach 60, I will probally feel like I'm 46.  So I had better make 46 a really good year.  It's good to plan ahead.

      A little bit about me.  I have always lived where I live now.  I've never desired to move.  Went to school here in southwestern Oklahoma, took a job here, raised a family here.  I will most assuredly die here.   I enjoy good music, good movies, good comics, and good television.  And yes, I will be letting you know what constitutes "good", according to the gospel of escape.  I am sure you will be hanging to my every word on each subject.   Bought my first computer in 1993 at the urging of my daughter.  Soon became horribly addicted to sitting in front of it and letting it suck the marrow out of my brain. I don't think I was the first to suffer from this addiction, but perhaps I was.  I dunno.  I began "networking" with others who shared similar interests.  By 1996 I was emailing, websurfing and chatting on IRC with folks from around the globe.  Made many friends, some quite close, and whose friendships I hold on to, to this day.    My nickname or "nick" throughout all of this was escape.  Seemed to be a fitting one.  Work and stress and "real life" gotcha down?  Just hop online and allow yourself to  e-s-c-a-p-e, right?  Anyway,  10 years later, and countless connections/conversations/data sharing/collection building/etc later... its safe to say that computer purchase I made back in '93 was a good one.  The nick "escape" continues to work for me, so I suppose I will keep it for awhile longer.......  It just occurred to me that I don't think brains HAVE marrow.  *sigh*

         Sometimes collecting comic books makes me feel like Beetle Bailey.

      I know some days are rougher than others.  Its difficult to maintain a smile when the really bad days hit you.  But for me, when life is dealing me headaches, I just stop and think of ponies.  Not just any ponies, but ponies dressed up like members of the  urlLink  Justice League  .  A tip of the blogcap to  urlLink  Howling Curmudgeons  ...   and yes, Guy Gardner Pony is MY favorite too.

      When I was eleven years old, I would ride my bicycle across town to Vic Rains.  Vic ran a grocery store and meat market, and had probally the largest magazine and comic book selection in southwestern Oklahoma. Huge wooden shelves lined the northeast corner of his store, at least 6 of them, all fully stocked with every type of periodical you could want.  Think of the magazine selection at a Hastings or Barnes & Noble TODAY....... and that's what we had back in 1969, at Vic Rains Food Market.  Old concrete floors, the aroma of homemade BBQ and chili simmering every time you walked in the store.    And between the sports magazines and the detective fiction magazines, near the very corner of the store, were 3 comic spinner racks.   3 of them.  Stuffed full of comics.  My friend Ricky and I would pedal our bikes there every Tuesday and Thursday.  Vic always had the new books on the racks by noon... and if he didn't, we would ask if we could "help" put them out for him.  He always smiled that smile, and let us.    In 1969, you could buy 8 comics for one dollar.  Actually, after sales tax, you would have 2 cents in change to buy that really good grape bubble gum that came in the clear cellophane wrappers.  There is no entertainment on earth that could possibly be as value-filled, as those trips I made to Vic's.   Once I got my drivers licence, the bicycle was retired, but the Tuesday and Thursday trips remained a constant.  Vic, now in semi-retirement, had his son Rusty running the store. Rusty removed one of the spinner racks, and took out two of the old wooden magazine shelving units.  Times were changing....... kids weren't buying as many comics as they used to.  I offered to buy the unused spinner rack off of Vic, and he just smiled that same old smile and insisted I take it home with me at no charge.   He told me it would just end up in a junkyard otherwise.... and besides, I had always been one of his best customers, and it just seemed like the right thing to do, he said.   Vic and his son closed their store down in the mid-1980's.   By that time, he was down to only one spinner rack.... and virtually no magazines at all.  A couple of video games sat where my friend Ricky and I used to sit, crouched down, counting our change, chewing that grape bubble gum and organizing our four-color treasures.  I was a customer of Vic's until the day he closed up shop.  Vic passed away about 5 years ago. A widower for quite awhile, he would come into my restaurant that I manage, to eat regularly, until his health got bad.  He always asked for me by name, and loved telling my crew that I was his most loyal customer.   I still have the spinner rack that dear old man gave to me, it sits here in my office, filled with comics from my youth.  I give it a spin occasionally and close my eyes.   I can smell the homemade BBQ.... and can feel the concrete floor beneath my feet.    Thats the beauty of this hobby, comic collecting.  It's an escapist literature in many regards.  Vic Rains always helped me to escape.  And I miss him.

      Not really.  I think there are enough forums for political "content" already.  From what I've observed, the stronger one feels about his or her canidate, the more effort is extended in totally ridiculing & making the OPPONENT look like a horse's ass.  Which is all well and good..... I enjoy the ENTERTAINMENT value of reading political forums that spend (I'm not making this up) 98% of their time and bandwidth talking about the opposition, and 2% promoting and educating me about THEIR canidate.  Some of them are quite funny.  So while I do indeed have strong political views, you won't be getting them here.  Its way too easy to start slinging a little mud, just because one can.  I will, however, go to bat for my buddy, Bill the Cat, who has returned to the funny pages in my favorite Sunday comic strip, Opus.... and is currently the mayor of Bloom County.  The strip has been running in a limited number of newspapers since late November of last year, and has really picked up steam since Ol' Billy Boy has returned.  It's not currently appearing online......but to see if it appears in a paper near you, click  urlLink  here  .

         That Dean. What a NUT!  I couldn't take that guy anywhere.....  Heading back to Vegas for a fun 4 days tomorrow. We've been traveling to Las Vegas at least twice a year for the past 5-6 years.  We just love it.  We stay away from the overpriced glitzy shows, the overpriced nasty buffets and my wife insists we stay away from the overpriced hookers.  *sigh*  I learned early on  to book hotel & air EARLY.... you really do save a ton of cash that way.  We bargain hunt for the best "off the strip" shows/lounge acts/blues bar bands/food/entertainment.  We always rent a car.  This is because (1) Its cheaper to rent one car for 4 days IF YOU LIKE to shoot all over the city.  The south end of the strip is nice, but I've been there, done that.  Most of our best times in LV have been in little out of the way restaurants/bars/casinos.  And taxi's aint cheap.  (2)  There is no way in hell I'm WALKING miles and miles in 115 degree heat.  I'm on vacation.  After discounts, my rented car costs less than $20 a day.  It allows us to be independent, plus its fun to stop at intersections and watch all the sweaty, heat-stroked, about to friggen' die TOURISTS pounding the pavement.  But thats just me....  We have a standing agreement with most of the major casinos.  When they see us coming, they just stand at the door, we walk in, we HAND THEM ALL OUR MONEY, they thank us and we leave.   It saves tons of time that way, you see.  Seriously, we are actually more fortunate than we should be I think.  Most EVERY trip, either the wife or I end up bringing home far more than we took.  Never enough to retire of course.  Just the illusion that you really pounded the casino.   Keeps us coming back.  Speaking of luck, one of my best friends, Mike, will be in Vegas with his wife on exactly the same week we are.  His mom and dad are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, and they are all staying at the casino next door to us.  What are the odds?  We plan on hooking up with them Tuesday afternoon..... Im looking forward to it.  I'm looking forward to that steak at the Bay Area Diner downtown too.  And the NEW Star Trek Experience ride/exhibit. And seeing my pals Frank, Dean & Sammy again.   And some good stand-up comedy at the Improv.  And that  look on my wife's face everytime she hits a small jackpot.    Hey, I love Las Vegas.   If we hit it BIG on the slots, I will be sure to report the news here.  And if we don't, I will probally blame it all on the hooker.  :D
