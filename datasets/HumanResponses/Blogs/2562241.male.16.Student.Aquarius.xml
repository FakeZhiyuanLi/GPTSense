      Well..., I was almost fired today for being too sleepy. I spent last night watching .hack//SIGN, an anime, and it looks like I'm gonna do the same today too.  .hack//SIGN says alot about me, my life, my reality, and the world. To put what I've seen short, it's about whether or not this reality is really what you want, is it really the way we perceive it to be? What is deemed "evil" in that anime is not completely evil, and good not completely good. Nothing is absolute. Everything has a purpose.  It gets you thinking, why are you here? What if one day, all this reality you see is completely destroyed? Will that be necessarily completely bad, or good?  I don't know how to describe it, but the anime had affected me deeply, in just 12 episodes! The entire story consist of 28 episodes. Additionally, there are other .hack// series that link back to these 28 episodes. There's .hack//, a manga, .hack//SIGN, an anime, .hack//INFECTION, QUARANTINE, OUTBREAK, MUTATION, the four games, there's .hack//DIVERGANCE, an ongoing online RPG, and then there's .hack//Legend of The Twilight Bracelet, another anime. It's a looooonnnggg story, but it's well worth your time, and cash. It challenges your current perception of what it is, but only if you watch it in the Japanese fan subbed version. The English version just makes the experience horrible, and feel unoriginal.  Go get it guys. Feel your reality melt away.

      Come on. Be completely honest. How many of you actually do what you think is right because YOU want to do it?  Here's a scenario. If you are sitting down in a crowded coffeeshop ala marketplace, you'd have people squeezing in between occupied chairs to get to their family/friend. If you actually sat down and noticed the faces of the people who gave way..., well, you don't see a happy face. I do not comprehend why can't people EVER be honest and just tell that biatch to STFU if they don't like giving way. Is it because they wanna save face? Or is it caused by society's pressure for you to change?  I personally think it's society. In fact, both questions up there are related to society's pressure. Society is corrupted, and thus it corrupts US along with it!  Please people, be more honest with yourself, and everyone around you. If you don't like it, tell'em to STFU and get the hell outta there. Sure, extreme at best, but you gain honesty. Go sit down somewhere and notice things around you. Most people just don't have time for that. Or break the law and spend the night pondering in prison. That'll help too.  I call upon everyone to help improve mankind, and remove that stint of dishonesty and corruption.

      Well, apparently, I'm getting tired of my usual Internet life without blogging. Well, here I am, back in blogger, and ready to offend more people with my eccentric views. Just bear with me. :)  I'll post a new post tonight, since I am currently working, and blogging is a big no no for the office. :p
