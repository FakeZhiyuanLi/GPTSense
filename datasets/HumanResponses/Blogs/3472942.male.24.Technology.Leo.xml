Month end afterall.  one freaking thing i don't believe! i ask that TS to help me account for the empty cartridges at the back of the office.  and he told me "hey i'm wearing white teeshirt today, i might dirty myself if i count"  fuck la who's in charge now?!!? end up i did it myself while i got my partner to sort out the outstanding payment. *grumbling* to myself i sum up the job in 30mins.  woo then then good thing came.

       woo finally a flaw in the singapore's computer system. the other day sia's computerized check in system went down for 10mins causing a delay that sum up to 2hours, 10over flights delayed. imagine jus 10mins.  now many areas of singapore are in pitch black. why am i blogging? tat's because i have un-interrupted power supply at home, courtesy of american power converstion. of course not idiot. i'm jus lucky that my place isn't hit. so i had to write this down, sitting in my aircon room. typing away.  i got so many calls and sms, from jurong to bedok, to geylang, to joo chiat, to senkang and the list goes on. i realised i do have a number of friends across the island. haha.  ohh let's make good use of electricity. i hope goverment apologise and waive this mths' electrical bill!

       first time in singapore. the dreamcar motorshow at the singapore expo did not awe me as it seems to have promised. the evolutionVIII from toofasttoofurious was a replica by some local mechanics.  and i tot it would be the real ting. ya, there's a lot of fancy cars around, but u cun feel them, there's tons of "Do not touch" signs around, politely reminding u how you are too keep your distance.  unlike the previous motorshows at suntec, whereby you can sit in them, feel them, and even take photos with the professional camberaman there. but i guess it's a rare occasion that you see so many fancy cars together. autobahn actuali provided a lot of cars for the show.  never missing the integra, the model displayed was missing the red sports rim that i liked, it had the white body, carbon fibre bonnet, and black sports rim. actuai black rim is ok, but not my ideal one.  the honda integra 6speed manual typer solid.

       busy day really. started early at 9.20am. the flight was to arrive. did not take long for that mr powers (or at least that's how i address him) i dunoe how to spell tho' to come.  introduced ourselves and off we went to send him to his hotel room. our part was done now and everything else now was left to the more supreme powers the directors' part of the game.  and so it was servicing after servicing, delivery after delivery. my life seems so boring entertaining the usual   "hi mr neo, i'm really sorry but i think i'm having some technical problem with my printer, i cun get it to work"    "hi mr neo, your cartridge jus cas my paper to jam"    "hi mr neo, your cartridge cun work with my printer"   and more then 80% of the time, it's cas they have a freaking paper jammed in the printer. blame it on me somemore. these ppl are really one kind. but smiling seems to be my killer tool. i can smile for 30mins non stop through a customer's continuous complain and sacastic remarks on me and my product. and at the end of the 30mins, i will smile sweetly to prove to them that it's their ignorance and hot temper that cas the damn printer to jam not my TONER !  but i guess i build a lot of patience because of this. i now do amazing things with my patiences. i can wait for ppl without any complain going through my mind, i can sit in a jam and jus listen to the music, i can even let ppl shout at me for something i nv do, previously i think i might punch his nose in or something.  and soon it's sch again. this intensive week is really intensive man. 7 continuous days, running through the weekends.  but today sylvia brought me sushi, rice ball.. hmm there's a name for it but the stupid me jus think it's sushi.   it's so pretty! i wish i had a wider vocab to describe how it looks like, but i guess i din't study enuff. pretty-est! thing i've seen this mth. omg and it was for me.   heng i nv let her drop off at some ulu busstop and insisted to send her back   else i would have killed myself. i wonder if its' the tot of the sushi in my bag, i was so hungry throughout the whole lecture and finally when the break come i only had enuff time to go to the toilet! and i din't eat it!  but maybe it's worth waiting for, got home and eat it up. i think i took 2mins or something. gave 3/4 of one to my mum. maybe i should ask her make bigger ones as big as my big head hehee. then can eat more. *grins* i've never been so hapi in sch.  finally something rewarding me for my tough day.  *looks at pda* why is it always full of something?

       wonder why i am relaxing so much nowadays, monday again, went back to work @ 9am. everything seems so slow.  i don't believe i was calculating cost for my B16, 12inches hair sample for 2hours before i finally got it out. well might be because i took a hotdog break and a maggimee break in between. *grinS*  ever since the senior technician left us, things began to slow down, for the first time now i was hoping that orders dun flood me. today i went for servicing, the lady was so nice. cas i send one piece over which she ordered. but all of a sudden, she decided to order another 3 pieces, that makes 4.  i was happy of course, that would sum up to $400++ with servicing and all. but i open up my pda, i checked my stock, i only have 2 pieces of what she wanted. hai.. i guess i have to do the recharge, as if my work was not enough to kill me.  maybe i dun really feel well today, kinda sick. this flu virus is spreading around my company. felt so weak. but of course it might be because i'm plain lazy on a monday.  BCT Products, EastTech. BCT Products, EastTech. BCT Products, EastTech. ArgHHH!!! as if i had not enough things to do again!! his dad tells me that he's leaving for HK tml morning. arghh why does he always have to leave for this and that.  everytime he leaves, i've gota do so much more! jus entertaining his customers are enough to kill me, not to mention that all those ppl dun speak my kind of english. *sighs*  sometimes i wonder if i'm working for money or is there other reasons pushing me forward. yahh.. i wanna buy over hp, make hp fall, but what the fuck man. it's impossible. dun be stupid. hp can jus crush me anytime. maybe hp don't even know i exist! and most prob, they dun!  his dad keeps pushing me to his company. ask me to take over from him with his son, my 11yrs of good buddy. it's true and i understand that he want me to do well as his company  is at least a world wide company and i will do better there.. yet he wants me to give up EastTech.  but EastTech is my baby. i've seen it grow, i even remember when i first started with me drawing a pathetic $500bucks! to what i am now. give it up now? Hell NO!  but hmm... he's still the boss. even though i'm running the company with my friend, we still take direct orders from him i guess. that's one big fat mistake when he offered to invest 90% of capital in the company and i agreeded.. cun blame myself tho.. i'm not filty rich and i can only slog my guts out. i needed that capital to back me up. there's no one to blame, his dad was the one who made me what i am today. but he jus don't understand how much i've put in to EastTech. EastTech, BCT.. he says if i want to make it big, i'll have to give up one. either i move to his company and walk on the solid carpeted floorings or i stay with EastTech and slog my guts out.  sometimes i wonder.. is money really so important? can't ppl live happily without money? honestly i dont' like money. the reason why i earn money is because i want to prove that i can do what i wan and do it well.. sounds stupid and lame eh? i guess that's me.  for now.. i check my pda again.. tml is a busy day. and i guess i'll have to decide where to go in a few wks time.  i wish i can ask someone what to do, where to go. but i cun. life..  always so full of choices..  if for once i can choose what i want to be, i'll opt to be living in those village days. my 3years in my kampong village with my parents left a vague impression. but i remembered it was sweet. there's this picture always flashing across my head, where me a a lot of kids would go to this van, that uncle i dun remember how he looks like but he got a lot of candy and bread on this van, and we'll take and run away, of course mama told me she had to pay later on. *heehee that is where ppl are friendly everything is so true and transparent. no choices. nuthing. not like this cash society. everything was simple and true. simple and true.

       really pity rachie, how can she have such cocky teammates. i used to team with a china teammates before in poly. he's also one kind one. head big big like watermelon. anyway ppl like him and rach's teammates are always around i guess. how else can we hate someone if there's no good reason   tadaaaa, the realisation of the word "anger"   anyway i'm going shopping with xueli tomolo.. how come they alway arrow me when they wanan get presents for their bf one? nevertheless. because tomolo is somehow a special day to me, but since it no longer is, i decided to go with her on the boring  "search for my bf present" outing.  she also damn one kind one la.. one dae msg me tell me her bf lydat, lydat. then next moment become so good and loves her bf so much. she would be my typical kind of dramatic ger, the fairy tale story girl. crazy over that prince charming story. but honestly i dun know if this price charming of his can provide her the life she wish to have.. i hope so tho'.  as i watch the clock ticks to midnight. i feel a pinch, heart miss a bit. jus a feeling. tomolo will be just another normal day. i go to work, go shopping with xueli, come home and i'll slp.  good nite blog.
