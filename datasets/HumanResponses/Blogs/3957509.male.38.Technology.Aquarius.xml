      Life is a precious gift. Hold on and celebrate life. I was just thinking about how quickly life can end.  How life changes with just one call. "Mykal? Chris. Drew's dead. Fell asleep...I'm at the hospital...can you come?" "I'm on my way."  Just last week I had dinner with Chris and his partner, Drew. They have been together for 8 years. Yet, as of last night, Drew is no longer here - he fell asleep at the wheel, crashed into the highway divider, and was killed instantly. Only a mile from home! Hasn't it been said that many of these "falling asleep" accidents occur within three miles of one's home?  So, today is a day of memories, tears, anger, consolation, and sorrow.  Please keep Chris in your thoughts and prayers.  Peace!   Drew M 1968 - 2004 Requiescat in Pace

      Just another James Baldwin quote: "I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain."

      Have you ever had one of those days when the world around you doesn't seem real? That things are not quite what they seem? And that you suddenly have more clarity than ever before? Well, today has been of those days for me.  When I woke up this morning, I had a strange feeling (no, it wasn't Colm doing something naughty, hehe). I couldn't quite put my finger on it; then it hit me! I felt safe and secure. What an awesome feeling! I thought about where I was personally in January of this year: things were good, but I was alone. Then, March happened - meeting Colm, starting a new relationship with him, and eventually making one of the more difficult decisions for a couple - moving in together. When I picked Colm up from the airport last Friday  my heart was singing, my pulse racing - this was it, ready, steady, go! The unreality of things, you may ask? Maybe not so much unreal, but surreal - life passing by, being connected, yet not; loving, and being loved. I sometimes think that I will wake from my dream state...but Colm assures me that this not a dream. He is a great man, and I love him with all my being.  Clarity attained? As I have as one of my favourite quotes by James Baldwin (an author that, as of May 2004, I did not know): "Love him and let him love you. Do you think anything else under heaven really matters?" This is my life. Thanks for your being a part of it!  Peace!

      Summer has finally hit us! Heat and a rise in humidity are signs that our summer is here. Living at the beach does have its advantages, though.  Colm has begun his new job and is adjusting well. I am so happy that he is here and that we are together. I love waking up with my man next to me  .  Hope everyone has a great day!  Peace!

      Day three of a new chapter in my life.  St Patrick's Day 2004 - a day that will live in infamy!  Amazing how life unfolds. I met him at a friend's party on that day. His name was Colm - straight (more like gay) from Dublin! From the first moment we shook hands, I felt a new type of warmth flow through me. No, it wasn't pure lust, it was something much deeper. We enjoyed the party, and then said good night. The next day, while working on the network, I received a phone call from, yes, you guessed it, COLM! He wanted to thank me for last night and that he wanted to have dinner. And the rest, they say, is history!  And now, we have begun our new life together. He has moved in with me and we are enjoying each other immensely. Life is awesomely amazing!  Peace!

      It's good to be home!  LAX arrival @ 2:20a PST on Friday, 23 July 2004: man, is that late (or early, depending on one's perspective, I guess)!  Anyway, at home, to sleep in my own bed again.  Peace!

      Well, here I sit, waiting....still!  Now the plane is not scheduled to depart until 12:30a CST. Talk about an interesting adventure. I haven't seen the movie  The Terminal , yet, but I think I may, by the end of this trip, be a little like the main character who lives in an airline terminal!  Anyway, here I sit, waiting...still! No worries though - it's all good.  Peace!

      Well, here I sit,  - waiting! Airports are such adventures. My flight to Dallas-Fort Worth went off without a hitch. However, trying to get back to LA from DFW: a different experience altogether. No worries, though.  Flew into one terminal, told that my connection was in another terminal. Took the TrAAin (AA-DFW’s transportation system) to the next terminal. Flight delay! Okay, no worries, right at that gate was one of those “Aqua-Massagers”, so I thought, “Hey, why not kill some time?” 15 minutes later, relaxed and refreshed, I look at the monitor – time change for flight and also terminal/gate change, again. So, off I go to my next destination. And now, here I sit, waiting!  I am still on a high from my Toronto holiday and also visiting with friends in Cleveland. Now, am I ready to face the challenge of work next week?  Peace!

      Well, I just got back from holiday in Toronto. What a great city - wonderful things to see, lots to do.  This was my first time in the city and I didn't know where to start.  Looked at the map book and decided that a walk up Yonge would be a great place to start. What energy in the city! I walked up to Bloor then over to Church and down through the most "colorful" neighborhood. I enjoyed a drink at Woody's and imagined the cast from  Queer as Folk  walking in.  On Sunday and Monday did the same walk and saw a few of my "favourite things" - boys from a certain condo there. Total shock in I was! Anyway, even cuter (and taller!) in person. Also, I met one of the objects of my desire, Bozz. (If anyone knows how to contact this guy, please let me know!)  All in all, a very pleasant visit.  Peace!

      This past week has been a week of realizations. I entitled this entry "Reality 101" because I feel like I have gone back to the basics: live, love, work, play. With Drew's death, I have this overwhelming feeling that I have gone off course - I don't spend enough time with my friends or my family. Colm and I have our special time, but it's just not enough. His work schedule and my work schedule seem to conflict way too much. However, we did have the chance to spend some good, quality time together this past weekend. I had another job up in the Santa Barbara area, so that gave us the right reason for going back to that beautiful place. Here's a totally tangential thought - "Karaoke Revolution"! If you haven't tried it, do - you'll have a blast making a fool out of yourself and enjoying everyone else's foolishness! Peace!

      Destructive behaviour: too much of this, not enough of that.  I have a tendency to eat all the wrong stuff when I am stressed: ice cream, creme brulee (my all-time favourite dessert), French fries, fast food. With Drew's death, I have been feeling very finite and mortal. Today when Colm got home from work, I was sitting on the couch with three pints of Cherry Garcia, scooping and stuffing! Colm walked over, gave me a kiss, took the ice cream away and asked, "What are ye doing? Trying to kill yourself with that?" He knows that I have been trying very hard to stay away from the "bad things" because of family medical history.  With those simple words, I cracked: tears flowed, heavy sobs came. Finally, release from all the pent-up emotion of the last two weeks. Colm just held me, and let me just melt into him. I tend to be an emotional "stuffer", i.e., throwing all my feelings and emotions into the bag I carry over my shoulder. Then, when the bag is full, POW!, mess everywhere. Mortal and finite, emotionally spent, tired of being the strong one for everyone else, I collapsed.  As I write this, I realize that I am very fortunate to have good people in my life who accept and love me as I am. Colm is a blessing, I just can't say this enough. I am grateful, not only for him, but for everyone in my life. I say this now, for all the world to see (or at least the few see who see this), I LOVE COLM WITH ALL MY HEART!!!  Peace!

      There is such finality with a burial. We had the funeral for Drew yesterday, then went to the cemetery for the committal. Every time I see a casket lowered into a grave I feel so empty.  I was asked to share a poem at the funeral, and this is the one I read (someone gave this to me years ago, and I really love the last two lines):  "When I am Gone"  When I am gone release me, let me go; I have many things to see and do.  You mustn't tie yourself to me with tears; Be happy we had so many wonderful years  I gave you my love you can only guess How much you gave me in happiness. I thank you for the love you each have shown, But now it's time I travel alone. So grieve awhile for me, if you must;  It's only for awhile we must part, So bless the memories within your heart  I won't be far away, for life goes on.  So if you need me, call and I will come.  Though you can't see or touch me, I'll be near; And if you listen within your heart you'll hear  All my love around you soft and clear. And then when you come this way alone  I'll greet you with a smile and say, "Welcome Home." --Author Unknown  I know that we'll see each other again, my dear Drew. So until that time, QaPla!  Hug your loved ones today!  Peace!

      "What you up to? Not much; how 'bout you?"  This is how my conversation with Chris started this morning. The funeral for Drew is Saturday. Still can't believe he's gone. My head is still spinning, and Chris is so lost and hurting right now. I wish I could just take Chris' pain, but I know that I can't.  Colm is such a wonderful man! When he and I decided to move our relationship forward, I don't think he knew what he was getting himself into. Life seemed simpler two months ago. No tragedies, no family drama. But since we said yes, my Dad went into hospital with a major heart attack, another good friend of mine was diagnosed with colon cancer, Drew dies; and yet, Colm has been by my side through all of this, being my strength, the shoulder to cry on, the arms to hold and comfort me. After the funeral, I think Colm and I need to get away for a few days.  Jumbled thoughts today from a frazzled mind.  Peace!

      1 August 2004 - a new month has begun again!  It's hard to believe that we are now in the eighth month of 2004. Time seemingly begins to accelerate as we get older; this realization is a little frightening.  Colm and I did a little road trip yesterday after spending most of the day with Chris. We drove up to Santa Barbara. I have loved that place since I was seven. Every summer my family would spend a week up there. I just love the city. On the coast, about 85 miles north of Los Angeles. Temperatures are great throughout the year. Anyway, I digress...  We walked along the water, out onto the pier and just enjoyed each other's company. We then walked up State St and ate in one of the many bistros. I love this man with all my heart and am so grateful that he is in my life. He is funny, kind, gentle, compassionate, and so beautiful, on the inside, as well as the outside. I think about how devastated Chris is with the death of Drew. Ever feel guilty for having something that someone else whom you love has lost? That's describes a part of me right now. I confuse easily when shite happens.  On the ride back, I just enjoyed hearing Colm sleeping peacefully in the passenger seat. My heart swelled with love, pride, and admiration. Moments like these knock things into perspective. Hold your loved ones tightly and enjoy them!  Peace!
