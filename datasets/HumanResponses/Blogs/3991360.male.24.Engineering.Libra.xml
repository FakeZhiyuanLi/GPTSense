      Well, I think this is officially starting to become a habit.  Here I'm posting every day so far and I don't think it's that bad.  It's more like a diary but for the whole world to read.  I'll try to make sure I won't put anything embarassing about anyone in here.  If I do, let me know and I might take it out... Though, I might keep it in regardless :)  Tonight is Missy's night.  As mentioned in a prior post, we'll be going to The Dish for dinner and then to a bar called Fergs where some more people will meet up with us.  It should be a fun night, right? ;-)  Today was very fun as well.  When I woke up Mandy and Missy were just about ready to leave to go to the gym.  Apparently I was sleeping in today! :)  How many times does that happen to me?  Not often.  Well, they went out and I finally got out of bed.  Fixed Mandy's closet, took a shower, and then I went to go buy some pool toys for the pool later on in the day.  We had a lot of fun the last time we were at the pool together and had a little fish that sank to the bottom of the pool.  I went looking for a similar toy that sank and finally found it at the fifth store that I went to.  After that we had something to eat and then went to the pool!  Had lots of fun there until the rain wanted to invade in our fun, so we left.  Mandy went to take a nap and I did some schoolwork (for those who don't know I'm currently taking a class to get an MBA through the University of Phoenix Online).  Right now we're all starting to get ready for The Dish and tonight.  It will be fun!  Have a great day!

      Well, after much debate (yeah right!) I decided to call my travel agent and change my flight to an even earlier time.&nbsp; I left Washington State at 10:30am Local Time and landed in Tampa at around 9:00pm Local Time.&nbsp; To my wonderful surprise, Mandy was there waiting for me.&nbsp; It was definitely an amazing airport moment ;-)  I'm really happy to finally be home and I don't think I'll be taking trips that long ever again if I can help it.&nbsp; Though, if I'm forced to take a trip that long, I might just fly a certain someone out there for at&nbsp; least the weekend.&nbsp; Now that I'm home, I don't want to go anywhere!&nbsp; I was finally able to sleep in my own bed (what an amazing feeling!) :)  This morning, did I not only start doing my laundry, but I also started catching up on all the TV shows that I've missed the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; Have you seen the Series Premiere of Stargate Atlantis?&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed that! :)&nbsp; I also have some of Mandy's Soap Opera's taped and I'm looking forward to watching those with her when we get the chance :)  Not sure what all my plans are for today, but I know that I will go have lunch with Amanda today.&nbsp; I will also clean my place a bit, just to collect all the dust that has accumulated over the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; I'll be heading over to Mandy's place later on in the day when she's done with work.&nbsp; We'll probably go to the gym, grab dinner (take out?) and probably just take it easy the rest of the night.&nbsp; I'm still a little tired from yesterday and from being three hours off base :-/  Saturday we'll have some errands to run, probably go to the gym and pool and at night go out with Missy and her friends (Missy is Mandy's sister) for Missy's birthday.&nbsp; I think The Dish and Fergs is on the menu Saturday night.&nbsp; I told them that I'll drive that night.&nbsp; Let them have a great time ;)&nbsp; plus, you know I don't drink much :)  One more thing...  IT'S GREAT TO BE HOME!!!!  ;-)

      Today's the day!!!&nbsp; Yay!!&nbsp; Let me tell you that it's a completely wonderful feeling to know that tonight I'll be flying home finally.&nbsp; I've been here since last Monday and it's been a long two weeks.  I've decided to at least post a second post on this thing because I did receive some positive feedback after that last one.&nbsp; I figured if I continue at this trend, there will definitely be plenty of posts on here in no time :)  Last night wasn't very eventful.&nbsp; I came home from work, went to the gym, and read some.&nbsp; After I did go to a microbrewery with another guy who works out here and had a nice time.&nbsp; Of course, though, when I got back to the hotel, I started reading the book Digital Fortress and wasn't able to put it down.&nbsp; I did finally put it down at about 10pm, though, only because there were no more pages left to read :(&nbsp; I don't know what I'll be reading tonight in the airport or for when I'm not sleeping on the plane.&nbsp; Unfortuntely, on red-eye flights, they don't play any movies because most people are just sleeping anyway...&nbsp; Guess I'll have to cave in and join the sleeping group&nbsp; ;)  I don't usually have a problem sleeping on flights, though, I have a feeling that I'm going to be wide awake because I'll be very excited about going home finally and seeing Mandy :)&nbsp; I'll make it through it though and see her tomorrow!&nbsp; I'm excited!&nbsp; I figured I would arrive at the airport, take a taxi home, do some odds and ends at home, possibly take a nap.&nbsp; Then I'll head on over to her work and take her out to lunch.&nbsp; After that I think I'll need to just relax until the night, perhaps nap again or even catch up on everything my DVR has been recording for the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; Usually I don't watch TV when a show is on because if I start watching something at night, I usually can't turn it off :-)&nbsp; So, I have my DVR record it and I can watch it whenever I want.&nbsp; However, since I haven't been home, I'll now have lots to catch up on :)  I'm not sure if anyone noticed from yesterday to today, but I did change the font size of this blog and even changed the font.&nbsp; I really like Comic Sans font so I put it up here :)&nbsp; Another thing is the title of 'Dan's Thoughts' was forced into all lowercase.&nbsp; I'm into all the artsy stuff and making it look nice, but I couldn't stand my name in lowercase :-D&nbsp; So, I took off the lowercase force that was on there...&nbsp; Much better now, don't you think?  I figured that I'll have some time to play with the colors at some point.&nbsp; I'm not sure there's too much I'd change though because I really like blue.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point I would like to have this blog streamed to my new web site home at  urlLink http://www.thecoolrock.com &nbsp;though the site isn't finished, nor started yet.&nbsp; I did register the domain already and I own the site, I just need to find the time to set it up.&nbsp; It'll also give me some room to post pictures so I can link to them from my posts...&nbsp; I do have to have pictures of me and people I know up here, right? ;-)  Ok, I'm still excited about going home.&nbsp; I can't wait :)&nbsp; For those of you I'll be seeing soon, I'll see you soon.&nbsp; For those of you I won't be seeing soon, I'll see you later ;-)

      Wow!&nbsp; I don't know where to start.&nbsp; I figured that I would start a blog because I see other people that I know have one.&nbsp; The real encouragement was the blog that my girlfriend  urlLink Mandy  has.&nbsp; I might miss reading her updates daily, because I just talk to her, but it's even more wonderful to read them after the fact and remember different things that happened in her life.&nbsp; So, I figured, what the hell, I'll try that as well.&nbsp; I don't know how often I'll update this thing, but I'll sure try to do it every so often ;-)   I'm currently in Washington State, I've been here for well over a week and I'm looking forward to flying home.&nbsp; I changed my flight from an all-day Friday trip to a red-eye going from Thursday night to Friday morning.&nbsp; Mainly because I want to see Mandy and spend time with her.&nbsp; I miss being home so much.   I've realized that taking a week long trip isn't too bad... a Monday to Friday trip.&nbsp; However, once the weekend comes, the trip becomes too long.&nbsp; It's hard being away from home and not having someone to do things with.&nbsp; I find myself exploring the area alone, but it's just so boring and so sad.&nbsp; This weekend I went to a couple of movies, a mall, and even saw some friends that I met online.&nbsp; But it is still not home, and I miss home lots.   After the weekend, the trip gets really bad since it feels as if the days go on forever.&nbsp; I find myself skipping out of work early just to get away from there.&nbsp; Recently, I've been doing cardio in the gym in the hotel here to just spend some time doing something...&nbsp; Figured out that reading on a bike is similar to reading in the bed, though, at least when I'm on the bike I'm getting exercise :)&nbsp; I think I'll make it a habit of reading while doing cardio, it passes time nicely.   I can't believe I've finished Angels and Demons last week and bought two more of Dan Brown's books, Deception Point and Digital Fortress.&nbsp; I've already finished Decpetion Point and I'm almost finished with Digital Fortress...&nbsp; For those of you who don't know me, I dont' think I've read this much before in my life :-P&nbsp; Like I said, I have lots of time out here doing nothing :)   I've been trying to eat well while I'm out here as well.&nbsp; I used to not care what I ate and pretty much ate anything, but, I figure why not?&nbsp; It'll give me something more to try to keep my mind occupied ;-)&nbsp; I've been eating lots of chicken and pasta out here, with an occasional run to get some fast food now and then...&nbsp; You have to satisfy the cravings, right? ;)   What else can I tell you about?&nbsp; Well, how about my love life? ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I'm very happy with  urlLink Mandy (or Amanda... you'll probably see me refer to her both ways). &nbsp; She makes me so happy whenever I see her, whenever I hear her, or just get a brief message from her.   I'm not going to lie, I have had girlfriends before (shocker I know), however, the way I feel with Mandy is quite different from the rest.&nbsp; When I'm with her, I'm not looking forward to the next time I can be alone and do things that I want to do, I'm actually looking forward to what we'll be doing  together  next.&nbsp; When I'm away from her, I look forward to the next time we see each other.&nbsp; When we're this far apart and either of us are on travel, then I'm looking forward to the next phone call or the next instant message.   I don't know if I believe that there is necessarily one person for every person out there.&nbsp; However, I know that Amanda makes me feel wonderful and I love her.&nbsp; I love spending time with her and her family.&nbsp; I'm not sure I've ever felt this comfortable with my girlfriend's family before.&nbsp; I like it.   Well, I suppose that I should be getting to work out here...&nbsp; Anothe day, another dollar ;)&nbsp;  urlLink Send me a line  and let me know if I should continue this or not...&nbsp; Maybe I should regardless?&nbsp;

      Hello Cyber Stalkers!  Nothing much has happened since yesterday.&nbsp; I went home after work and napped for a couple of hours (remember I've been sick).&nbsp; Then woke up, had a couple of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, watched some TV, called Mandy, and went to sleep for the night.  When I woke up this morning I was wide awake and ready to work.&nbsp; Actually got into work at 7am this morning.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; I've started to make travel arrangements for next week and I'll probably be taking a 7am flight out of Tampa on Tuesday morning to get into Seattle by 11:30am.&nbsp; That will give me the whole afternoone to work on Tuesday, all of Wednesday and Thursday.&nbsp; My flight home is at 10:00pm on Thursday night and I arrive around 8:00am on Friday morning in Tampa.&nbsp; I'll probably go home, take a nap, and then go take my wonderful girlfriend out to lunch that day.&nbsp; That day will start the weekend before her birthday, that's her weekend :)  Also, luckily, this is my last week of class for my current class I'm taking.&nbsp; Which means, starting this coming Thursday, I won't have any homework to do and Mandy can have my complete attention.&nbsp; Next Saturday I think we're planning on going to Busch Gardens for the day.&nbsp; Maybe Sunday we can go to the beach... We'll see.. :)  That's all for now folks, until next time!

      She's so great.&nbsp; Today for lunch she brought me home made chicken soup.&nbsp; It was very good!&nbsp; I'm was impressed on how well that she can cook it.&nbsp; She's definitely a keeper ;-)  That's all I wanted to say, just that she's wonderful and I Love her.

      Yesterday afternoon my throat started to bother me a bit.&nbsp; It started to become a little sore and I was sneezing a little more than usual.&nbsp; I thought it might be allergies.&nbsp; Later on in the afternoon I started to really feel bad and took a cold pill.&nbsp; At this point my throat was really sore and post-nasal drip and sneezing persisted.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was pouring cats and dogs yesterday and there was water everywhere on my way home.  To my surprise when I got home, Mandy was there in my clothes.&nbsp; Apparently, she got drenched in the rain and was completely soaked from head to toe.&nbsp; She had put her clothes in the dryer and put on some of mine instead.&nbsp; She did look very sexy in my clothes as well :)  Luke soon after arrived and we discussed on where to go to dinner.&nbsp; In the end we decided on Cafe Cibo, a nice little Italian place near where I live.&nbsp; Luke felt that he did well on the bar exam and hopefully he passed and can finally start his career.&nbsp; We retrieved Mandy's clothes from the dryer.&nbsp; Luckily it wasn't raining anymore and the water on the ground started receeding into the surrounding grass.  The dinner was delicious.&nbsp; I think it was the first time that Mandy and I shared a meal.&nbsp; I liked the feeling of sharing a meal with her, it felt so natural, so wonderful.&nbsp; I suppose it's the little things in life that make you happy, and it's every little thing that I get to experience with Mandy that makes me happy as well.&nbsp; Who knows what our future has in store for us?

      I'll say one thing, I definitely had a blast last night at the gym.&nbsp; Mandy and I started out on the Pro Cor machine (elliptical), but to be honest, I didn't like it, and I don't know if I was even doing it correctly...&nbsp; My feet kept on bouncing off the pedals.&nbsp; Maybe there should be a strap on the pedals to prevent that, I'm not sure.&nbsp; After doing about 10 minutes on the machine, Mandy and I went to the treadmill to finish up our cardio.&nbsp; I think we did another 15 minutes on there.  Next started the Yoga class.&nbsp; Let me tell you, I had fun!&nbsp; The class started out slow, and I thought I would fall asleep in it, but it actually got better as the time went on.&nbsp; I was able to do things with my body that even amazed Mandy ;-)&nbsp; I think she was really impress with the balancing act I did on my hands while placing my knees on my elbows.&nbsp; I don't remember what the stance was called, but it was impressive.&nbsp; Maybe she can leave a comment on what it's called.&nbsp; I did have a blast in the class though and I'll be looking forward to the next time I'll be able to go.  Which brings me to next week.&nbsp; I'll be going to Redmond again next week, not sure when I'll be leaving, though, I'm planning on coming back on Friday probably, or perhaps taking the red-eye Thursday night.&nbsp; I'm not missing next weekend (it's the weekend before Mandy's birthday)&nbsp; I told Mandy that I would take her to either Busch Gardens or Islands of Adventure that weekend.&nbsp; It will all depend on whether or not we want to drive to Orlando.&nbsp; We'll see and I'll let all of you know.  My training did get approved for New York and I already had someone purchase me a seat in the class, so that's all set.&nbsp; Next will be checking out flights and hotels in New York.&nbsp; Someone informed me that if it's cheaper for me to fly up a day or two early including the hotel nights stays, instead of flying up on the day I would normally fly up, then the company will pay for it.&nbsp; I would need to provide information to back up that claim though.&nbsp; It's definitely something to keep in mind ;-)  MAndy and Missy offered me to go with them to the Dave Matthew's Band concert, but I don't think I'll be going.&nbsp; I'm not a big concert fan myself, and not a huge Dave Matthew's band fan at that.&nbsp; I think I've only been to one live concert and that was Billy Joel :)  Today is Luke's last day for his bar exam for the Florida Bar.&nbsp; After work today Mandy and I will be taking Luke out for dinner, then Mandy will need to go home to do some errands and I think I might then take Luke out to get Fit Shaced.&nbsp; He deserves it, and again, I hope he passes. :)  I think that's all for now.&nbsp; Until next time my cyber readers...

      Well, Melissa left this morning and Luke went on out to start the bar exam. Again, I hope he passes with flying colors. :) I finally had that meeting with George, the senior program manager in charge of the research and development programs at my company. I convinced him that I don't need to go out to Redmond this week, and just head out there for the most of next week instead. I did make sure that I won't be needed out in Yuma next week for the test on Thursday, Friday, and possibly Saturday.   All this hopefully will leave me in town for the 9th and 10th of August so that I can celebrate Mandy's birthday with her. So far, so good with that.   I did just find out today that there's talk in my company about betting on the details of Mandy and my life together... Betting on when we'll get engaged, where, when the wedding is, where, honeymoon... everything! I hope they don't go through with it, or I'll make sure I bet on it too! ;-)   In case you don't have my  urlLink AIM  screen name, Here it is  urlLink SuperDan321 . Send me a line one day and let me know who you are and how you're doing ;) Also, if I don't know you, let me know how you found my blog! ;)   Now about that title...&nbsp; Today is Yoga Tuesday at the gym.&nbsp; I will be going to the gym with Mandy to do some cardio workout and then to the yoga class there.&nbsp; It should be fun... :)&nbsp; I'm looking forward to it.   Today during lunch, I went to pick up the better style for Mandy's birthday present and then went to Sears.&nbsp; I wanted to return the Crossbow (workout equipment I purchased in March 2003).&nbsp; Well, when I went to the initial sales person, he went to his manager and the manager told him that I could not return it because it was so long past the purchase date.&nbsp; I didn't accept that as an answer, so I told him to go get his manager.&nbsp; After talking to the manager, the best offer I was able to get out of him was $200 back (the initial price was $500 plus taxes for a total of $535).&nbsp; Then on top of that an additional charge of $75 to pick up the product from my place.&nbsp; Well, I didn't like getting back $125 total for the amount I paid, so I asked to talk to his manager, the store manager. ;-)&nbsp; When the store manager came, she was very polite and worked well...&nbsp; After talking to her for a while, and bargaining a bit, I got her to only take off 15% of the price ($75) and an additional $75 to pick up the piece.&nbsp; Also, I'll get the money on a Sears Gift Card instead of cash, but that will do for me :)&nbsp; It total I'll be getting back $375 of the $535 initially spent for the equipment.&nbsp; It's 30% off the price I paid ($150) but it'll do.&nbsp; I'll use that money to join the gym that I've been going to lately ;-)   Now for the reason for selling the equipment?&nbsp; Well, I'll be moving within the next six months.&nbsp; If I move into a smaller place to save more money, or if I move in with Mandy and Missy, there will be a lot of stuff that won't be able to move with me.&nbsp; So I figured I might as well get rid of it now while I have the chance.&nbsp; Otherwise I'll probably have to put it in storage somewhere and that's probably not a very economically viable option, especially if I have it in storage for a year and storage costs me $200 a month to have.&nbsp; We'll see as the time goes on with what happens.

      I can't believe it's Monday already!  The weekend flew by and now I'm at work!  It did go well and Missy's birthday activities over the weekend were fun!  I'll have to say one thing though, I am sorry that I accidently chipped Missy's tooth.  I've felt so bad about it and I can't help but feel sorry for the matter.  I'll make it up to her somehow, I'm sure.  Lately I've been teasing Mandy about her birthday present. Her birthday is coming up next month on August 10.  Fortunately, she has no idea what it is, but is so curious about it because I've been giving her truthful hints about it...  Though, with the hints I've been giving it could be almost anything! hehe :)  I'm trying to hold off going to Redmond this week, I've spoken to the guys up there and they're still going slow.  I'll decide tomorrow on whether or not I'll be going up on Wednesday.  Melissa and Luke are in town and Mandy and I are going to dinner with them tonight.  Then Melissa, Mandy, and I will be heading back to Mandy's place to celebrate Missy's real birthday.  It's fun to celebrate all the time! :)  I have to wish Luke good luck in the bar exam, which he starts taking tomorrow.  I hope he passes it and Melissa and he can move down here and start a family :)  Wouldn't it be great to have a niece and nephew close by?  (hint hint)  I've also submitted paperwork to go to New York City for some training.  I told Mandy that she'll have to come up with me and show me the town... Though, she then told me that it will be an expensive weekend because we'll be going to the diamond and gold district apparently... Not sure why she want's to go there though. ;)  It'll be a fun time and we'll be going in October if it's approved, so it'll give me plenty of time to save up the amount of money required for a couple nights stay there... $330 a night! sheesh! :-P

      Sometimes you don't just realize how badly you want to get home until you're prevented from going home. I was on my way to the airport on Thursday at about 5:00pm Pacific and was stuck in traffic for an hour... Not terrible, but doable. Once I got to the airport, I was yet to find out that my flight had been delayed... Ok, not too terrible. It was delayed because the incomming flight from Atlanta was delayed due to thunderstorms.  To pass the time I decided to eat dinner and talk to Mandy. After that I found a nice spot in the airport where I plunked myself down and slept for a few hours. I actually did get a few hours of sleep in and felt good.  The flight did finally take off at 1am (originally it was supposed to take off at 10pm).  Before I left, I had changed my connecting flight because I would have missed it already.  The next flight would have given me 15 minutes after landing to get my butt over to the next terminal, I've done it before, and I figured I could do it again.  On the flight I was able to grab about four more hours of sleep, very good!  I was awake for the last hour and witnessed our landing about a half an hour before the scheduled time.  I thought, "alright!"  However, I didn't know that we would be waiting on the runway taxiing all over the place and not make it back to the gate until it was time for the flight.  Well, I missed that connecting flight to say the least.  I then changed the flight to the next available Atlanta to Tampa flight which wasn't leaving until 10:15am or so.  I was able to take that and arrive in Tampa arond noon, originally I would have been there at 8:00am, but se la vie.  The good news is that I wasn't tired after I landed and I didn't need to sleep once I got home.  The bad news is that I missed having lunch with my Mandy.  However, I did go to her place for the rest of the day once I went home and got settled. :)  This is her birthday weekend and we were planning on going to Busch Gardens today, however, it seems that the world is frowning upon us because all week the weather.com was stating that it would be a sunny day, now this morning it says that it will be raining all day.  I guess we'll have to find something else to do as it now ruins the back-up plans we were thinking of which was to go jet-skiing. ;-)  I guess we'll have to find something indoor to do, any ideas?  Oh, I also had Mandy open up her birthday gift yesterday.  She was so thrilled as to what it was and she couldn't get that beautiful smile off of her face.  I still think she's sleeping with the smile on her face now :)  I got her a pink mini IPod.  It's something that she mentioned that she wanted months ago and I picked up on it and tried my darndest to get one.  The mini Ipods are very hard to find, and pink is one of the most sought after colors available.  At first I was able to get a mini, however it was green.  Then about three weeks after that, (I was still actively looking for a pink one) I was able to get a hold of the pink one.  I'm glad that she likes the gift, it was hard to get ;-)

      It’s hard to imagine the importance of one’s life, When the world is so huge and covered in strife. But it’s not what that person does on a worldly scale, But who she interacts with as she weaves her simple tale.  As the time passes on and as the world turns, The only thing that’s left is love and concerns For the people she touched and left upon her mark, And the rest of the people are left in the dark.  It is I she has touched on her long-winded ride, Through the courses of life, I’ve smiled and cried Right next to her as she holds her head high And she looks at me with that twinkle in her eye.  Her presence brings so much joy to me, Whether she is saddened or very happy, She looks like a goddess and just makes me smile, With her, I know, I’ll be with for a while.  -An Original Dan

      I did start a nice long blog just minutes before.  I had a wonderful whole thing presented, but I accidently deleted it and I cannot seem to get it back.  I'll make this one brief and if I feel the urge I'll try to write another one later. :-P  To sum it up though, I'm leaving tonight on a 10pm flight and I'll be home at 8am tomorrow.  Let me see if I can type the rest up or something.  I'm bummed :-/

      Well, I'm not back at the hotel room yet, though, it's only nearing 5pm local time, it seems like it's much later.  I guess that's how I'll feel since I'm trying to stay on the Eastern time instead of this awful West Coast time. :)  The day was definitely a long one, or so it feels like it.  Currently I'm just keeping someone company as he works with explosives (there must always be two people present whenever someone works on explosives, it's a safety issue).  The Electronics group up here has seemed to pull through, though a little late for my taste.  I'm not sure if their slowness will ruin the week next week or not.  I'm leaning on the not side, though, I won't hold my breath.  I did anticipate them going slowly and I did make a failsafe in case that happens, I created a document that lists everything that I do with these units so someone with some intelligence could follow the instructions and do exactly what I do.  I know it makes my job look easy if I can put it on paper, but who cares :-P  So, here I am, after a long day, and all I can think about is Mandy. :)  Since I've been sitting here not doing much I figured I'd call my Grandfather and see how he has been doing.  He is well, and said he loved the picture of Mandy and me that I sent him, we do look good in the picture.  I'll post it as soon as I set up a site where I can place the pictures to link from.  Oh, and he does say hi to you Mandy. :)  Tomorrow will be another long day for me.  I'm planning on staying in the explosives building for most of the day so that as many mortars can be completed as possible and hopefully I won't have to travel again until Wednesday.  Cross your fingers, I know mine are!

      Well, here I am yet again.  I'm in Redmond, WA, the land of constant rain and overcast skies.  Yesterday I did end up getting a hair cut after work and it looks pretty good if I say so myself, and I do say so myself ;)  I then went to get something to eat since I knew I was leaving today to go to Redmond, I didn't want to buy anything and leave it in the fridge.  Then went home, packed up for the couple of days I would be leaving, watched some TV and then left to spend the evening with Mandy.  I stopped to get her a rose and then moved on to her place.  I couldn't have timed it better when I got there.  When I was pulling arounf the road, she was just coming back from the gym and driving across the street, she didn't see me pull around and then she went to pull into the garage.  I quickly parked, got out of the car, and ran over to the garage to try to surprise her before she realized I was there.  I did surprise her fairly well and she was very happy to see me.  We then went inside and just enjoyed eachother's company.  I think I said it before that it's a wonderful feeling to just be somewhere with someone and not have to entertain them or worry that they're not having a good time.  She was doing some work and I was just watching TV, but it was such a great night because of that.  I love just spending time over there because I feel so comfortable.  If this is what living with the one you love is like, then by golly, I'm all for it.  It was even good once Missy, her sister, got home.  There wasn't any akwardness at all...  There wasn't anything bad.  It felt as if we were a family and everything was normal.  I loved it.  I finally left pretty late at night, headed home and crashed, only to wake up at 5am Eastern.  Then went to the airport, where I found out that I was bumped up to first class.  Can't complain about that ;-)  and now it's 5pm Pacific and I'm pooped!  I need to sleep soon :-P  I'm gonna go grab dinner, talk to Mandy a bit and then doze off to sleep and dream about her.  :)  Until tomorrow cyber pals. ;-)

      Well, there goes yet another weekend, and what an amazing weekend at that!  I had a wonderful time spending the whole weekend with Mandy.  It'll be memorable for many reasons and I'm very a very happy person today :)  I spent Sunday with Mandy and Missy the whole day.  We went food shopping, lounging around the house, doing work, and cooking.  It was just an amazing weekend because I felt like I was a part of the family and we were just doing our everyday things together.  No need to be there with each other every moment of the day, but there if needed and around if not needed.  It was just an amazing feeling to be able to spend my day like that and I'm looking forward to many more.  Normally at this time I'd be out getting lunch, though, I'm of postponing it a bit because it's raining cats and dogs right now outside.  It would not be fun at all to go out there right now, I'd be soaking wet.  I was going to go home for lunch today and have the amazing pb&j sandwiches I like eating, but now I'm thinking about just ordering in.  I also wanted to go to AAA during lunch to pick up a couple of Busch Gardens tickets so that Mandy and I could go there on Saturday, but I guess that'll have to wait until Friday when I get back from my business trip.  Tonight I'm planning on getting a haircut.  I think it's been about 6 weeks since my last one and my hair is getting a little long.  It's getting tougher to stick it straight up :-)  More to come as I think of things... :)

      I can't believe that it is August already!  Where has the year gone to?  I guess time does fly when you're having fun because I've been with Mandy for most of this year and I definitely had fun and time flew by! :)  Last night Mandy, Missy, and I invited Ann-Marie and Eric over for dinner and then all went out to the movies.  Ann-Marie is a new teacher who teaches at Missy's school.  Eric is her boyfriend who moved down with her fomr New York.  They're both very nice and fun to be around.  We all went to see the movie 'The Village'.  Let me save you the trouble and tell you not to see it.  It wasn't worth the money paid to get in!  I was under the impression that it would at least be moderately scary, but it wasn't even that!  It was pretty bad and I would not recommend anyone else to see it.  If you have to see it, I would first advise you to wait until it comes out on video and watch it with lots of people so that th cost per person is minimal :)  I bit my tongue about a week ago, and I seem to keep biting it every day.  Don't you hate when that happens?  Usually it happens with a cheek, and you bite it, but then it gets swollen just a little bit...  But because it's slightly bigger than you're used to, you're more apt to bite it again.  Well, that's what's happening to my tongue.  It's irritating.  Today should be an interesting day.  I think we'll be going to the gym in the morning then perhaps go shopping to take advantage of the back to school no tax thing.  Today is the last day that it's offered and I think I'd like to get a new pair of sneakers.  If not, I'm sure Mandy would like to get some more clothes ;-)  After that, it's a working day.  I'll be sitting and doing a paper for school and Mandy will be doing some work as well.  I don't think we'll be going to the pool today since right now it's raining and I think it will be raining for most of the day.

      Wow!  Sorry it's been a little while since I last posted, but a lot has happened!  I left work on Thursda a bit early in order to get some extra supplies from Publix before going home and preparing my place for the incomming hurricane.  It was supposed to be a cat 2 or a cat 3 hurricane.  I then packed up some belongings and went on over to Mandy's place for the night.  After getting there, we relaxed for the rest of the day and I went to dinner with her and her parents.  This was in the middle of the evacuation for Pinellas County for levels A, B and C.  Well, we were supposed to be evacuated by 6pm on Thursday night, but decided to make a decision on Friday morning.  We slept the night away and woke up at 7:00am to the decision to go ahead and leave and head to the evacuation shelter.  This was to be at a school nearby.  We arrived there and they suggested that we leave and go to another place, so we went to that next school and stayed there.  I had an amazing time, however while we were there, we found out that the hurricane was actually upgraded to a category 4 level.  It didn't phase us at all and we continued to have a great time together.  We watched a movie, played lots of card games and just had a wonderful time toether.  Eventually, we found out that the hurricane would completely miss us pretty much altogether.  So at around 6:00pm we decided to take the trek back home and clean up the place.  All, in all, it was a wonderful time and a wonderful experience and I'm glad that we didn't get hit at all and not as much as I thought we would.  The one thing that I was afraid of with my place is the storm surge that was incomming.  My place would have been flooded for the sea level that it's at.  I'm happy.  Ok, time to relax.  Talk to you all later ;-)

      Well, I decided to go on back to work today after I woke up this morning. My throat hasn't gotten any worse from last night, but it hasn't gotten any better. Well, either that, or I'm imagining it being the same. As per Mandy's advice, I've brought a gallon of Arizona Green Tea to work with me. Hopefully it'll help my throat feel better. To be completely honest, I feel fine, I feel great, if my neck was not hurting I would say there was nothing wrong with me... Stupid neck :-P  Right now, I feel like a marine in Stanley Kubrick's film Full Metal Jacket... The quote  urlLink "What is your major malfunction numnuts?"  comes to mind.  I feel like there's always something wrong with me whether it's because I'm sick or something else.  So what is my major malfunction?  I need to be returned and get money back I think.  :-)  Lucky me, I just received an e-mail announcement for a reorganization in the company.  Nothing that directly affects me in any way, however, there was an engineer taken off the engineering team, so that leads me to believe that it might be possible for me to be taken off the team like I wanted to happen.  This will just give me some ammunition to get taken off the team once some of the new contracts that I've been working on are granted.  Let's hope.  Last thing to talk about today would be the pending hurricane that is supposed to hit tomorrow, Charley.  The path of Charley changed a bit over night and it looks as if it will be going directly over Tampa Bay now.  This is bad because it's path has been slowly moving West.  Well, if we end up on the East side of the eye of the hurricane, we'll be in the worst part of it.  I was thinking that I might be able to just stay at my place during the storm, but I'm not sure that it's a good idea anymore.  I'll have to wait for the forecast later today to see what is said, but it worries me a bit.  I'll be going to the supermarket during lunch today to pick up a few things like water and such.  I'll also find out later today if I work tomorrow, most likely not because this building that I'm in is also a Category 2 evacuation zone.  yay! :-P

      Well, today isn't as bad as I would imagine. I've stayed in bed for the most of the day whether watching TV, playing games, or talking to Mandy. Hopefully, by tomorrow morning, I'll be feeling better.  Mandy and I have played a couple games of Literati and chatting up a storm. I love talking to her, just hearing how her day is going makes me feel better. Apparently what happened with the water in the kitchen last night is that their neighbor upstairs had a dishwasher that flooded and the water came through the kitchen. It destroyed the ceiling and possibly some of the cabinets. They'll have to get a new ceiling to replace that one and possibly new cabinets as well.  I also played John a couple games of chess online. I lost the first game and the second game was a draw. Soon I'll take a nap to try to relax my nerves a bit and perhaps later I'll continue work on my website  urlLink The Cool Rock .  I haven't worked on it in some time, I don't even think that the site works as all, but working on it relaxes me a bit so I think I'll do it.  There are two hurricanes making their way towards Florida this week, Bonnie and Charley.  Apparently Bonnie will probably go North of Tampa Bay and we don't have to worry about it, however, Charley is something else and might be headed straight towards us.  If it becomes a category 2 hurricane or greater, I'm supposed to evacuate where I live.  It's supposed to land sometime on Friday and my work place also is supposed to evacuate if a hurricane is category 2 or greater.  I did receive an e-mail about Charley today from work and I'll find out more information tomorrow on to whether or not to come into work on Friday.  Guess there aren't any snow days here, but hurricane days aren't too bad!  If the hurricane gets to 3 or above, I think Mandy will have to evacuate her place as well...  Though, we'll see, Charley isn't predicted to go over a category 2, and there's still plenty of time for that to change.  Mandy and Missy are planning on having an Opening Ceremony Olympic Party this Friday.  It should be fun.  I'm hoping that if I'm feeling better I'll feel up enough to go, if not, I'll be watching the ceremony from home.  Though, the hurricane is coming through on Friday, so not sure what exactly will be happening because of that.  I guess only time will tell.  I wonder if I'll feel like posting again later today... we'll see ;-)

      I've decided to stay home sick today.  I figured I need to take a day off to just not think about anything and not do anything.  And, I think I've needed this for some time.  A day of no worries, no work, and no problems to think about.  Hopefully a day like this will help put my illnesses in recession because this morning I woke up and my throat got a little worse.  I don't want to be sick, I never asked to be sick, and I  sure don't like to be sick.  It's very uncomfortable for me to swallow right now and I hope that the medication that the doctor gave me will help with that.  If not, I definitely have a rough time in the next couple of weeks coming up.  I did talk to Mandy a little bit last night, and  in the end she had to go abruptly.  I hope everything is ok, but on her instant messager away message she stated something about her kitchen being flooded.  I didn't get to talk to her about that, but I hope it's not too bad.  I guess I'll look forward to her next birthday to make that one the best birthday ever.  Maybe I didn't try hard enough for this one and I'll need to try a bit harder next year.  She deserves the best of everything, always.  If I'm feeling up to it later, I'll try to post again for an update.

      I woke up this morning with a tiny, little, itty-bitty scratch in my throat. I thought it was due to the lack of sleep I received last night, but to be sure, I called up the dr to make an appointment in the next few days. It just so happened that someone had cancelled an early appointment today, so I was able to get in and see the doctor. I wouldn't want to see the PA at this place because the PA there couldn't diagnose my mono when I had it a few months ago.  The doctor informed me that I have a virus and will take a couple weeks to get out of my system on it's own, in the mean time he gave me and anti-viral prescription to help prevent anything else from happening from it...hopefully.  Normally, me getting sick wouldn't be such a big deal, but, today is Mandy's birthday. I was invited to go out with her family to  urlLink The Melting Pot  but now, I'll be unable to go.  I told Mandy that one day I'll take her there.  I don't like making a committment and then not making it.  I know it's not completely my fault for missing dinner tonight, but it still doesn't let me go.  I think me getting sick has to do with all this stress and traveling that I've been doing for work.  Hopefully with the ending of the programs that I've been working on and the ending of all this travelling that I've been doing, that I'll get better and put all of these illnesses behind me.  I feel really bad about everything with Mandy...  It seems that I've been sick for the brunt of the time that we've been together.  What's weird is that she has hardly been sick and I'm the sick one continuously.  And what's really weird is that before a few months ago, I hadn't been sick in years before!  But, again, I think this has to do mostly with the fact that work is taking a toll on me and my lifestyle.  I'm continuously working 50+ hour weeks and sometimes a 60+ hour week, especially when I'm traveling.  I hope it all goes away real soon with the ending of these programs this week.  If I'm lucky.  Let's hope I get better soon.

      Well, Another week has passed since last Monday, can you believe that?  So far I'm in town and hopefully will stay in town all week.  I spoke to the Program Manager in charge of the programs I've been working on recently and I've been trying to convince him that I'm not needed out in sunny Yuma, AZ this week.  I'll find out for sure probably by tomorrow.  Yesterday was very good for me.  After cleaning up my place, I was able to relax for a while before heading over to Mandy's place for dinner with her, her sister and her mom.  She made an amazing chicken dinner.  I tried to help the best I could by staying out of her way, but she would have none of that and forced my to make rice for us... Luckily, it came out tasting very good, so not all was lost.  After dinner, we watched the movie that we weren't able to watch earlier in the weekend, 13 Going on 30.  I really enjoyed the movie.  It reminded me a bit og Big with Tom Hanks.  Sort of wanting to grow up and realizing that you really don't want to grow up just yet.  Two thumbs up on my end.  The day today hasn't been too eventful.  I'll be visiting Mandy later tonight... She's very excited that tomorrow is her birthday, though, I'm not too excited about my birthday coming up.  I don't want to be 25 just yet, I think it's too close to 30... How can I be close in age to 30 already?  Where has all my life gone to?  I'm getting old!  I know I remember, almost as if yesterday, going through high school and not having any worries at all... Now I'm not only done with high school, and my undergrad, but I'm also a third of the way through my MBA.  Where has all this time gone to?  I'm at least happy for one thing though, I'm enjoying the ride through life now.  Spending time with Mandy is a wonderful thing and I'm enjoying every minute of it.  If I have to grow old, it sure is fun with her nearby! ;-)

      Not a whole not of news this day. Today I've deemed as Dan's Cleaning Day. Since I've either been out of town, spending time with Mandy, doing schoolwork, or one of the many other things I've been doing recently, I've set today as my cleaning day. I've been cleaning since I woke up at around 8:00. Between doing laundry and just plain straightening up, it's been taking a while :-) Now, I'm not normally a messy person, but with all the traveling I've been doing, and with how often I've just not been here, I've neglected my place a little. So, today it's been getting it's needed cleaning. It wasn't too bad to start off with, just not up to my standards.  I'll be heading back over to Mandy's later today. We'll be cooking dinner together and then perhaps if the weather permits, go for a rollerblade, although, I'm not holding my breath. It rained all day yesterday and was a little gloomy, though, Mandy and I made the best of it.  We started the day at the gym in the morning, which was quite eventful ;-) Then, later, we went off to the International Mall where we had a great time. Mandy got herself an armband to listen to the IPod Mini while she is working out at the gym (when I'm not there) ;-) We stopped in Brookstone for a nice relaxing time in the massaging chairs that they have there... You know, for only $900, I can get a faux black leather massaging chair that matches my couches wonderfully ;) hehe Next, Mandy and I stopped at the Godiva store and had some chocolate. Mandy had a white chocolate covered set of various berries while I had a white chocolate covered candied pineapple.... Now, for those of you who don't know me, I don't really like chocolate, it's too sweet for my taste... This experience just clarified my feelings towards chocolate... I'll leave the Godiva store for the chocolate lovers out there for now on... Oh, Mandy did allow me to go into a game store for a little bit :) I guess that's my present for getting the chocolate :-D  When leaving the mall, it was pouring rain outside.  We *walked* through the rain to the car and when we got to the car, we had our first kiss in the rain.  I think Mandy was planning that kiss the moment we started *walking* in the rain.  She got a kick out of being in the rain getting soaked...  I on the other hand wasn't too thrilled about it, though, I did offer to go get the car and pick her up, she wouldn't have it.  So much of being chivalrous.  We drove back to her place and napped the afternoon away.  When we woke up we decided to get take-out and a movie.  I went to go get the movie 13 Going on 30 from Blockbuster, but they were fresh out.  I picked up dinner and headed back where we ate and watched While You Were Out for the rest of the night.  All-in-all, it was a wonderful day and possibly better than it would have been had we gone to Busch Gardens instead.  Though, we're still planning on going there in the future, maybe we'll go later in the Fall when the weather is a bit cooler?  We'll see.  Until next time.

      Well, today's almost over so I figured I'd blog a bit.  Hope you like it.  In the middle of the night, A puppy yelps a lot, To wake his master up, As he sleeps on a cot.  The old man then awakens, And straightens his gown, He picks up the dog, To make him calm down.  But the puppy was afraid, It had a bad nightmare. Was kicking and yelping, And awoke with a scare.  The owner hugged him, And pat on his nave, As he told the poor puppy, To grin and be brave.  The puppy looked up, And performed a little trick, Then curled up in a ball, And fell asleep real quick.   Oh, and I love Mandy :)

      Well, this weekend went well, once the hurricane was over.  Saturday I went back to my place to find it all in one piece.  No flood damage (since there was no flooding) and there wasn't any other damage of any sort.  The only thing that I needed to do was to put all my things back to their original place.  It took a little while, but everything was put back properly and put together.  I think the thing that took the most amount of time was putting my TV back to its place and hooking up all of my electronics.  I spent the rest of the day just relaxing and being myself :)  That night Mandy came over after tutoring and I made her dinner.  That was the first time that I actually cooked for her, now she'll probably expect it much more now that she knows that I can cook :-P  I've gone this long without her knowing, but I suppose it had to be found out eventually.  We spent the evening just hanging out and keeping low-key.  It was a nice relaxing night.  Sunday, I just stayed home for a while before heading to Sears to find a birthday present for ym Grandfather.  After that I went over to Mandy's place and we went to her parent's.  There, I played cribbage with her and her father and impressed them with one hand when her father laid down one ace making the pile 29 on top of my ace, and I then laid down two more aces, causing not only 31, but also a four of a kind...  In the end, I lost both games, but it sure was fun! :)  The night finished by us eating dinner and then going for some exercise.  Mandy and I rollerbladed while her father and Missy rode bikes.  We went all around the neighborhood for about a half hour.  It was nice.  Which leaves today.  I woke up feeling much better, and I went on to work where I found out that I don't have much work to do now.  Unfortunately, but fortunately, all of my programs have pretty much ended.  The fortunate part about that is I won't be stressed out over the programs, the unfortunate part is that I don't have a program to charge to...  It's never good to charge as overhead at any company :-P  Now, I feel absolutely great.  I figure that I'll be completely over this virus in the next day or so...  Definitely by Wednesday with the rate that I'm going.  No need to worry  ;)  I also started a new class last Thursday, only 5.5 more weeks until the end of this class :-P  This class is called Operations Management.  Have a great day! :-)
