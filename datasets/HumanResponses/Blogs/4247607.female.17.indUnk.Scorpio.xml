       The day I dread and pray won't came all weekend has arrived and I cannot be more bummed. Mondays are always the worst days, its just a fact of nature. Anyways I was fighting with my homework all weekend and found that it didn't want to come up on my computer at home so now I don't know what I'm going to do. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.     ~cartoon~   the cartoon is saying that lack of parental supervision is damaging to a child, even more than too much television.

       TGIF EVERYONE!!!   Its finally the end of the first school week and I'm extremly excited. Friday is always a good day except for the fact that it tends to go by slower than any other day but thats ok because when its over I have a whole two days without school. Its amazing how everyone mood changes on a Friday, hardly do you ever find anyone in a bad mood even if they were in a bad mood for the rest of the week. Well 6 hours and 50 mins left till I go home. YEA!!     ~CARTOON~ The cartoon is about a man who bascially has to withdraw his whole life savings from the bank to buy and pay for school supplies.

                 I absolutely, positively, certainly, cannot stand working.  I hate it the most when I have to work on a school night and drag myself out of bed the next morning to go to school.  I get off of school go to practice an than home to do whatever homework I can do before I have to go to work, everything I don't finish I have to do when I get home at 11:00  or later.  The thing that gets me is a lot of peope do this and we all do for minimum  or slightly higher wages.  We all complain about it and we often come to school looking like zombies because of the lack of sleep.  Than there are the privilaged few who decide that they can only work on weekends  making us who can't afford to only work on weekends have to work more hours.  I guess thats the way the cookie crumbles.               ~CARTOON~          The cartoon means that if you are not careful while riding A.T.Vs or other motor vehicles yoou could end up dead.

                The editorial cartoon is just hurricanes Bonnie and Charley beating the stuff out of Florida.

            As I was desperately trying to pry my self out of bed ths morning after working five hours last night I realized how much I actually hate waking up for school.  I rather sleep than get up, take a shower, and go through the whole mess of getting ready to go to my doom (oh I mean school).  All kinds of rules and restrictions and than endless hours of homework and studying are just not something I look foward to waking up at 5:45 in the morning for.  Maybe its just me and maybe I'll get over it but for now I'll stick to saying school sucks.

                   Yesterday was the first day back to school,  I'm excitied about being a senior ths year but I do miss my summer of work and sleep as a daily routine.  Now I have to add study and homework.  I never get to sleep late anymore since I have to be up at 6am on Saturdays and 7am on Sundays to open at work (Subway) so I feel like I never get to sleep anymore.  Somewhere between everything else I have to add majorette practice, club meetings,  and spending some time with my boyfriend Wayne.  My schedule this year is pretty demanding,  this class is fairly easy  but than I have classes like honors calculus, honors english v, and ap enviornmental science.  Next semester I have ap english v, honors physics, honors chemistry II, and ap english IV.  If I don't pull my hair out by the end of this year I'll be lucky.  Well thats all fr today.  See You Later.      Ashley
