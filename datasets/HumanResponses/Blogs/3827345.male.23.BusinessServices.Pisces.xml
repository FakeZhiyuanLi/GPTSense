						     Happiness ! :   A rooster was scratching the ground in search of some good grain to eat, when he happened upon a sparkling jewel. The jewel was a joy to behold, but the rooster was unsure what to do with it.   'What a beauty you are, and surely you are of great value,' the rooster said to the jewel. 'But I would happily opt for a single grain of delicious barley than all the jewels in the world.'   This fable, adapted from Aesop, reminds us to place our own personal value on things. A high price tag does not bring happiness. A bright shine does not bring joy. Usefulness, sentiment, personal meaning are all more important.   Do the things that bring you happiness. Spend time with people who make you complete. Surround yourself with things that bring you comfort, and you will create daily happiness for yourself.

						    urlLink SantaBanta Jokes -- Last name : "The manager of a large office noticed a new man one day and told him to come into his office.  'What is your name?' was the first thing the manager asked the new guy.  'John,' the new guy replied.  The manager scowled, 'Look... I don't know what kind of a namby-pamby place you worked before, but I don't call anyone by their first name. It breeds familiarity and that leads to a breakdown in authority. I refer to my employees by their last name only ... Smith, Jones, Baker ... that's all. I am to be referred to only as Mr. Robertson. Now that we got that straight, what is your last name?'  The new guy sighed, 'Darling. My name is John Darling.'  'Okay John, the next thing I want to tell you is . . . ' "

						   I Haven't taught in 50 years what my father taught by example in one week.  Take integrity over popularity and you'll always be coo.  Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth.  Fear cripples the soul, so you just have to fight it.  The true friend is the one that's coming in the door while everyone else is going out.  I don't believe in stars. Except the ones you can look up and see.  NO great deed, private or public, has ever been undertaken in a bliss of certainty.

						    "The first day of school our professor introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know. I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being.    She said, 'Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty - seven years old. Can I give you a hug?'  I laughed and enthusiastically responded, 'Of course you may!' and she gave me a giant squeeze.  'Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?' I asked.  She jokingly replied, 'I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel.'  'No seriously,' I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age.  'I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!' she told me. After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends.   Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this 'time machine' as she shared her wisdom and experience with me.  Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went.  She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up.  At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium.  As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor. Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said "I'm sorry I'm so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know."  As we laughed she cleared her throat and began: "We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success.  "You have to laugh and find humor every day."  "You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it!"  "There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change."  "Have no regrets. The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets."  She concluded her speech by courageously singing "The Rose."  She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives.  At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago.  One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep.  Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.   GROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY, GROWING UP IS OPTIONAL. "

						     " When she reached the alley, which was a short cut to her house, she decided to take it. However, halfway down the alley, she noticed a man standing at the end, as though he were waiting for her. She became uneasy & began to pray, asking for ' God's ' protection. Instantly a comforting feeling of quietness & security wrapped around her; she felt as though someone was walking with her. When she reached the end of the alley, she walked right past the man & arrived home safely.  The following day, she read in the paper that a young girl had been raped in the same alley, just twenty minutes after she had been there. Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy & the fact that it could of been her, she began to weep.   Thanking the Lord for her safety & to help this young woman, she decided to go to the police station. She felt she could recognize the man, so she told them her story. The police asked her if she would be willing to look at a lineup to see if she could identify him. She agreed & immediately pointed out the man she had seen in the alley the night before.    When the man was told he had been identified, he immediately broke down & confessed. The officer thanked Diane for her bravery & asked if there was anything they could do for her, she asked if they would ask the man one question. Diane was curious as to why he had not attacked her. When the policeman asked him, he answered,  'Because she wasn't alone. She had two tall men walking on either side of her.'   NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF PRAYER "

						    "There once was a man who had nothing for his family to eat. He had an old shotgun and three bullets. So, he decided that he would go out and kill something for dinner.      As he went down the road, he saw a rabbit and he shot at the rabbit and missed it. Then he saw a squirrel and fired a shot at the squirrel and missed it. As he went further, he saw a wild turkey in the tree and he had only one bullet, but a voice came to him and said, 'Pray first, aim high, and stay focused.'    However, at the same time, he saw deer which was a better kill. He brought the gun down and aimed at the deer. But, then he saw a rattle snake between his legs about to bite him, so he naturally brought the gun down further to shoot the rattle snake.    Still, the voice said again to him, 'I said 'pray, aim high and stay focused.' So, the man decided to listen to the voice. He prayed, then aimed the gun high up in the tree and shot the wild turkey. The bullet bounced off the turkey and killed the deer. The handle fell off the gun and hit the snake in the head and killed it.     And, when the gun had gone off, it knocked him into a pond. When he stood to look around, he had fish in all his pockets, a dead deer and a turkey to eat.      The snake (Satan) was dead simply because the man listened to God.     Bottom line: Pray first before you do anything, aim and shoot high in your goals, and stay focused on God. Pass this on in order that someone else might be blessed. Never let others discourage you concerning your past. The past is exactly that - ' the past.' Live every day one day at a time. And remember that only God knows our future and that he "

						    During my second month of nursing school, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I read the last one:      'What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?'      Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, red-haired and in her early 40s, but how would I know her name?      I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.  'Absolutely,' said the professor. 'In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'.'  I've never forgotten that lesson. I've also never forgotten her name was Dorothy.

						     some wisdom from Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos cookies:  "The first thing is, you got to be passionate about the idea. I'd been making cookies for 5 years. I'd been eating them since I was twelve years old. I love chocolate chip cookies. So it needs to be an idea you're in love with.  "A lot of people have ideas and they go around and research them forever. They want to get a guarantee that the idea is going to work....so you gotta do something."  And  "The biggest mistake is they don't listen. We become expert and we think we are experts on everything.  "Now I am an expert on the cookies that I make. But I'm not a great business person. So I think it is very important to listen. Other people have great ideas, too."

						   BREAK FREE  My daughter had a friend over to play yesterday morning. They decided to go outside, so I decided to play hooky and join them, chasing them through the paths I've mowed down in our little woods.  Whee! That felt great. You only live once.   As a bonus, I think I was more productive that afternoon.  Take a few moments to really enjoy life, even when 'serious' things seem to command your attention."  :-David Leonhardt

						     WASTE  I hate waste. When I have to throw out a cabbage that we didn't eat fast enough or strawberries that were not as good at the bottom of the basket as at the top, it just breaks my heart. I don't quite arrange a funeral, but I often do observe a moment of silence. And I go out of my way to reduce waste wherever I can.  Perhaps I am just eccentric, but I suspect that if people appreciate more what they have, if people had lived through a famine or a prolonged war, that perhaps we would all be less wasteful.  Is there some way you can increase your appreciation and reduce your waste

						     PRIORITIES   Do your dishes really need to be dried, or could you just let the water evaporate? If you spend just 5 minutes per meal drying dishes, that equals a quarter of an hour per day, or 91 hours each year.   Imagine spending almost four days in a row standing at the sink drying dishes. No eating. No sleeping. No bathroom breaks. Just drying dishes for four days straight.  Now imagine doing something else with that time. Savoring the fresh air. Going on a camping trip. Playing with your children. Volunteering at the food bank. Upgrading your career skills. You can do a lot in four days.  Or you can dry dishes.  Some chores we have to do (like washing the dishes). But some are optional. You are given a short time to live. How you spend that time is your choice.

						     BLEMISHES   Ooh. Not another mosquito bight. It's another blemish on my skin. I can just add it to the pimples that break out at random like I've been hit with a blemish shotgun.  It's funny how we view blemishes.   There is a billion dollar make-up industry founded on our fear of appearing to have blemishes. We cover pimples, age lines (After all, it's embarrassing to be the only person who ages, right?), scars and other marks.  We poison our apples to remove blemishes and make the apples look healthy and nutritious. (Doesn't that seem strange, that we would rather have healthy-looking apples than healthy apples?)  We work harder to get spots off our mirrors than to remove grunge and crumbs from the silver ware drawer.  It's nice to have good looking things, but isn't it what's inside that counts? What would the world be like if people worked as hard to clear up the blemishes on the inside as they do the blemishes on the outside? Kinder? More loving? Happier?  Let's keep working to improve the people we are, not just the people we appear to be.

						     PERSONALITY  "A person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter's not a nice person"  Dave Barry's words reminded me of a friend, many years ago, who told me she always liked to go to restaurants on a first date. She would watch carefully how her date treated the waiter...because that is how he would treat her ten years down the road.  This is one way you can evaluate possible friends, current friendships and potential business partners. It is NOT the only way to evaluate them, but if somebody is rude to the waiter, it is worth thinking twice about your relationship with that person.     APPRECIATION   "God answers all prayers. Sometimes He answers 'yes,' sometimes He answers "no," and sometimes the answer is 'you gotta be kidding.'"  Jimmy Carter is right. Sometimes we just want too much. Pretty well everything we need, we already have. Our lives would be a lot happier if we spent more time enjoying the things we already have than asking, wishing, hoping for more.  Of course, if God had a sense of humor, he would give us almost everything we ask for, and watch us remain just as unsatisfied wishing we had even more.     OPPORTUNITY   I was watching my daughter play in the sand at the beach. She would dip her bucket in the water and pour it into a hole in the sand to form a puddle. The sand would soak up the water, or it would flow back into the water.  No problem, there's plenty more water and plenty more sand. Another bucket-full, another puddle. And so, she hopped along the beach creating one puddle after the other, leaving behind a trail of ex-puddles.  Life is like that beach. As one opportunity after another ends, so many more open up, if we are willing to just let go and hop on to the next. Friends move away, new friendships are to be made. Jobs end, new jobs open up. Cheesecake gets finished, but the grocery store is still open. You get the idea.  Don't wallow over what's gone by. Hop on to a new opportunity.

						     INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS  "Pretend that every single person you meet has a sign around his or her neck that says 'Make Me Feel Important.'

						     BEAUTY   This one comes from one of your fellow subscribers:  'This morning I went for a morning jog in a nearby park. The rainy season has started in our area. While jogging, my eyes set on some plants of the garden with beautiful colours of flowers on them. It was so refreshing, immediately a thought came to my mind -- how unselfish nature is, always giving mankind without expecting anything in return. It gives its best, without asking for anything in return...what humans should be like? This thought gave me so refreshing a start to the day, I was extremely happy today.'

						      FAMILY  A few weeks ago, I offered a perspective on drying dishes (as opposed to letting the water evaporate) and whether this was a good use of the very limited time we are granted on this planet. One subscriber offered this alternative perspective:  "Another thought is, do dishes, laundry, sweeping, dusting, and other chores as a family. The best conversations I ever had with my parents, grandparents, and other family members were when we were doing dishes or laundry, etc. TOGETHER!"  Indeed, folding laundry is what passes for going on a date in our house!   SUCCESS   This is our final day with hypnotherapist and success guru Jan Tincher, and another tip to help you make your life a smash success:  Learn to create, not compete.  A successful lumber dealer told the newspaper reporters what he did to stay ahead of the game.  Every night he said he sat quietly in his darkened room and relaxed.  Then, he tried to imagine how the lumber business would be conducted ten years from now. He would write down everything that came to him and tried to put them into effect in his business immediately. He didn't want to wait for the ten years to come around. He wanted to succeed now.  While his contemporaries were competing with him, he was creating his future.  Learn to create, not compete. Every day, do some concentrated thinking, visualizing, about yourself, your work, your family. Anyone from ages ten to one hundred and ten can benefit from this way of thinking. Create life. Live life. Enjoy life.   KNOWLEDGE   Hypnotherapist and success guru Jan Tincher returns for tip #4 out of 5 to build a successful life:  Do you have a large vocabulary?  A large vocabulary implies broad, general knowledge and characterizes the more successful person, regardless of her or his occupation.  Do you know how much time it takes to learn just one new word a day? Five minutes, tops.  Learning one new word a day helps you build a large vocabulary easily and effortlessly. Have you learned a new word today?   BEAUTY   "This morning I went for a morning jog in a nearby park. The rainy season has started in our area. While jogging, my eyes set on some plants of the garden with beautiful colours of flowers on them. It was so refreshing, immediately a thought came to my mind -- how unselfish nature is, always giving mankind without expecting anything in return.

If you look for beauty, you will see it. Do you see beauty?   DIRECTION   Scissors cut. In fact, they can cut really well. What a wonderful job of cutting scissors can do!  But, wait. Where are those scissors cutting. No, they should not be cutting right through the middle of the picture. The scissors are doing a fabulous job of cutting the wrong thing.  It is wonderful to do something well, but make sure you are doing the right thing well.   ORGANIZATION   You know you're a parent when... you can't find your cordless phone, so you ask a friend to dial your number, and you run around the house in a frenzy, chasing the ringing until you find the phone buried amongst the towels in the laundry basket.  If that sounds like you, you probably carry around waaaay more stress than is healthy. Taking time to get organized can make a big difference in whether you enjoy life or whether you just barely survive, hanging on by your finger nails.  You might still run around in a frenzy from time to time, but hopefully less often.   AGING   Are you aging or are you evolving?  This is a serious question. If you are aging, it probably means that you are feeling tired and worn down. And the world is probably passing you by.  If you are evolving, it means you are adapting to your own developments and to the changes in the world around you.  OK, class. All together. Pick up your pens and cross out "AGING" above on your computer screen and replace it with "EVOLVING".   POSSIBILITIES   "It's kind of fun to do the impossible."  Look what Walt Disney accomplished with that motto. Imagine what you could accomplish.  Everything is possible once it is done, even those things that seemed so hopeless before they were started. We all run into those situations every day. Those are the "I can't" moments.  Instead of saying "I can't", ask yourself "Do I want to?" If the answer is "No", go ahead and say "I can't". But is the answer is "Yes" , ask yourself another question: "How can I?"   GOALS   Driving instructors know not to say, "Be careful not to hit that car." Why? Because the driving student will turn his attention to the car and is more likely to hit it. We drive where we focus our attention.  It is the same with our lives. What you focus your attention on is where you are headed. If you focus your attention on losing weight, chances are you will lose weight. But if you focus your attention on the ball game, on shopping or on Friday night bar hopping, don't expect to lose much weight.  Are you going to hit that car?   Initiative   Dr. Phil's Life Laws  Law: You create your own experience.  It is easy to blame others for our state of being, our position in society and for poor relationships. Dr. Phil is making it clear that we have the right and the power to take charge and make our life what we want it to be.

						      MOTIVATION   Law # People do what works.  We saw this in Dr. Phil's Ultimate Weight Loss Challenge. You have to identify the payoffs and use them as motivators.  For instance, how many people do you know who are stuck in a job they don't like or have simply outgrown? They want out but... What keeps them there? Simple. They are stuck in a comfort zone, and the payoff is that they don't have to worry about the risks of change.  You have to create your own motivation, and it has to be strong enough to leave your comfort zone and make the changes you need.   FORGIVENESS   Law # There is power in forgiveness.  We all carry with us baggage from everything we have experienced, including resentment or even anger. This is heavy baggage to bear, and Dr. Phil thinks we should unload it through forgiveness.  Forgiveness opens the way to reduced stress, better health, peace and, of course, much more happiness in life.  Perhaps you resent something your parents did or didn't do. You can do nothing to change what has happened. But you can forgive them. You can release the anger. You can release YOURSELF from the chains of anger.   RELATIONSHIPS   Law # We teach people how to treat us.  Have you ever taught a dog to obey a command? Dr. Phil is saying that humans are not that different. We respond to rewards and threats. When a result feels good, we are likely to repeat it. When it feels bad, we are less likely to repeat it.  Every time we react to what somebody else says or does, we are teaching her how to treat us. If you don't like how somebody is treating you, you can curse and blame...or you can retrain that person.  This is an area that might require professional help to explain what reactions you need to make in order to train the other person. But, just like with good dog obedience school, you will be training yourself at the same time.   MANAGEMENT   Law # Life is managed, not cured.  Too many people look to self-help books to "cure" them of a fear or a depression or an addiction or whatever haunts them.  Dr. Phil is telling us very directly that there is no cure for life. If you keep looking for one, you won't see what the good self-help books really have to offer: strategies for managing life.  If, for instance, you were born or developed over-abundant energy, learn how to channel it to help others rather than annoy them. If you have a food addiction, learn techniques to turn your attention to the right foods. If you have a fear, learn how to overcome the fear (feel the fear and do it anyway) or how to keep away from what causes the fear.  In the end, what counts is your life. Some is good, some not. If you can manage it well, life will be much more pleasant than if you chase after some magic cure that simply does not exist.   PERCEPTION   Law # There is no reality, only perception.  This is a really hard one for some people to grasp, since our perceptions always seem so real.  Of course, Dr. Phil knows there is a reality. The sun shines, whether we perceive it to be a wonderful, bright day or a dreadfully hot day. But our experience, our emotions, our results are determined by that filter of how we perceive the sun.  Perception is a choice, whether conscious or not. If there is one thing you can do for yourself, starting now, is to decide to perceive things positively. You will be amazed what a wonderful world this is when you become 100% committed to viewing it that way.   RISK   "Come to the edge." "We can't. We're afraid." "Come to the edge." "We can't. We will fall!" "Come to the edge." And they came. And he pushed them, And they flew.  Will you take French poet William Apollinaire's challenge? Come to the edge and dare to be the best person you can be today.   ACTION   Law # Life rewards action.  So you've set a goal, you've made your plans, and you are all ready to taste success. Why is it not happening yet? Dr. Phil says it is because we left out the most important part - action!  This is the biggest weakness of the self-help movement. Lot's of pretty words, but precious little action. It is for this reason that I mix useful tips in with the motivation in this newsletter. It is for this reason that I created the Get Happy Workbook to move beyond motivation and help people prepare individual action plans.  Are you stuck in a self-help rut, or are taking action to make it happen?   ADMITTING   Law # You can't change what you don't acknowledge.  Welcome to perhaps the toughest of Dr. Phil's laws. It is tough because we often make excuses for our behaviors. We don't want to admit to others or to ourselves that we have a problem. That is why AA considers it so important for members to say the words: "I am an alcoholic".  Whether it is an addiction, a bad habit, a character weakness or a fear that haunts you, the first step is to admit the problem. Acknowledge what is not working in your life.  Dr. Phil points out that you can lie to yourself in two ways: you can tell yourself something that is not true, or you can leave out the details you don't wish to acknowledge. Either way, you gain nothing by deceiving yourself.  This returns to Law # You either get it, or you don't. If you lie to yourself, you won't get it.  BTW, sometimes it helps to talk to your journal (writing a diary), when expressing your feeling out loud is too difficult.
