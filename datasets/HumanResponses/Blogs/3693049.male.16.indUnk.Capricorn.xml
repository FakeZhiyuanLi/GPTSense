Y!? coz... they wanna play? slp outside? be a begger? or wat?? nahz... all is wrong or maybe some is rite.. but wat i found out is tat.... is thier family prob... All family haf their own probs which others don haf it or cant understand it.. hmm some lack of warmth... material comfort.. space... so is like... hmmm the only way is to u not... don tink too much... coz y?? home is always ur home,... no matter wat happens.. home  is the safest place to be in... if not y.. when u r in trouble ... then 1st thing u tink is home?? coz it is the only place u can place ur trust in.. a place where u noe the doors will be always open widely for u to step into... a place where u belonged... so... i hope tat u ppl cherish ur homes... and family members... as u noe... we all r humans... so do ur parents... so? all ppl haf diff ways of thinking and ways of doing things..  so i juz hope tat... u all will feel much closer to ur homes now?? ya?? haha... jia you!! ^^
