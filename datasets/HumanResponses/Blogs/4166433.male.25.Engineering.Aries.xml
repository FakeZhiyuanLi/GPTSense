        The "Triple W", aka The World Wide Web really is a wonderful thing. To think how we used to survive and do things before without is almost baffling. A case in point occurred today. Being a newbie to this neighbourhood, city, state, and country, I need what is otherwise called a map so that I can find my way around. Now imagine if I had to do all this without having access to the web. How would I do it?       First task is to get the name of where I want to go. Let's say the local Wal-Mart store. Second task is how to find out how I get there from where my apartment is and how to get back. To accomplish the first task, the following dialog might occur between myself and someone:       Myself: "Where can I go to get a Microwave?"    Person: "Head over to Wal-Mart"   Myself: "Where's the closest one?"   Person: "You can find it on X street right beside the SomeName shop"      Stop right here.       Now you and I both know that it's common for people in general when giving directions to always use some point of reference and then give directions from that point of reference. Not all people do it, but a good majority of the world's population does.       Let's continue.       Myself: "How do I get to SomeName shop from here?"   Person: "Oh, that simple. Take the 54C bus to 4th Ave and get off at Y street."   Person: "From there, head West along Y street and it's about the fifth shop down."      Stop right here.       Coming from a country where we don't usually give directions in terms of compass headings like North, South, etc, I was a bit lost even before starting my journey. We at home might even a bit worse than this person cause we would say "Head up the road and turn left/right, then go down little more and you will see it. Can't miss it my yute!" Ofcourse I wouldn't get lost with those directions cause while I'm being told the directions, the person is actually showing me the directions with their hands. We Jamaicans can be quite graphic when we are ready.       Let's continue.       So now I have directions to Wal-Mart. Mind you, they are not the type of directions I'm used to but I guess I have enough sense to follow them. The worst that can happen is that I'll get lost :)       Now that we have that scenario, let's look on how I would od it using the "Triple W". The tasks remain the same but accomplishing them is different up to a point. The first task I accomplish in the same way. Ask someone where I can get the microwave and thereby know my destination. The second task is to go to web and search for Wal-Mart's website. At Wal-Mart's website I see a store locator feature which can tell me the nearest store location from a given address. Once I do that, I will have a destination address.     The next step which is a beauty of the innovation of man is using   urlLink MapQuest ,  the start address, and the destination address to get directions to the Wal-Mart store from my apartment. Doing this search at   urlLink   MapQuest     for directions gives me a map with my highlighted route, the distance I have to cover, and an estimated time that the journey would take. Excellent! If I don't drive and have to take the bus then all I need do is cross-reference my route with the routes of the local buses to see which to take. Microwave found.       The question now becomes, "Was it easier using the web or asking someone for directions?"      Personally I think it was easier to use the web. Simply because I could find what I wanted without really looking like a tourist in the area. In a way it was really an issue of security. When you are a tourist in an area you can more easily be mislead and targeted for any type of criminal activity. After all, I am a stranger and you don't know who you can trust when you first meet them. The negative side of this approach is that being human, I miss out on the social interaction that might have occurred had I got the directions from a person. It is always nice meeting new people because you never know what can happen and what you can learn.      You just have to be careful and alert I guess. In the end, I did get my Microwave.

       Today was pretty uneventful (is that a word?). Went hunting for some books on the booklist today. It amazes me how much these things cost when we will probably only use it for a few months. One good thing with this system is that you can resell them to the bookstore on campus and get back some "lunch money" :)  While I was in the bookstore I overheard a conversation between a store assistant and very good looking Swedish girl. I know she is Swedish from orientation, no pimping in progress here guys. I'm a good fella, remember?! Anyhow, the assistant was telling her that a lot of these books could be found on-line and that they would be better off if they did a search there. Interestingly, she replied that she finds it tedious to shop for things on-line. This came as a shocker to me cause I find things so easily on the net. Maybe it is a bit different for a Netizen I guess. This raises a question though ...  "What's so different about searching for stuff on the web versus in an actual store?"  Thinking about this I guess it may be that human element that is missing from the net. Remove the assistant from the store, and basically a shopper has to still look for things via a keyword or title on the bookshelves. Same as putting a keyword or title in a web form right? Maybe.  On the way home, I felt like I was walking a lot faster than I used to when I first came here. Mind you, when I first came here, my calves burned everytime I took a trip to school. Since that first day I've walked back and forth between school many times. School is on a bit of an incline so my calf muscles were getting a really nice work out. They do look a bit bigger now actually. I'm getting strong again ... yahhh!!!! :D .. lol  Seriously though, all this walking must be doing me some good I guess. We will find out when I hit the gym next week. I have free access for a whole year so may as well take advantage of it. They have some yoga classes too I think I may check out, even if it is just to watch and try to imagine myself getting that twisted ... ouuuuch!

       I never realized before just how much I took a television for granted until today. Stayed in today after waking at about 11a.m. I was supposed to go get some books for school and do some grocery shopping but only managed to do the shopping. Why? Simple laziness :)  So here I was in the apartment today after going shopping with nothing to do and feeling quite rested. This chica in the supermarket was telling me about a Juvenile (the rapper) concert that will be on later in the week. I might just go check it out. She's definitely gonna be there she says since the first 100 ladies get in free. Lucky her! Juve is a good rapper still, one of my favorites but I will have to see if I can organize a sponsorship for that concert seeing that I don't exactly have "entertainment" money for a while ;) ... wonder if she would buy me a ticket ... hmmm  Anyhow, back to what I was saying. I really do miss the television! Fortunately I have my laptop and the net. Found a nice stream on winamp's media list where I got to watch the latest music videos and stuff. It really is cool to have bandwidth! I must make a push to get it freed up some more when I get back to JA.  Being without the T.V. is a funny thing. You find yourself doing all the stuff you always say you want to do. Strange. So today I did a lot of reading, started learning a new programming language called  urlLink Python , and cleared up all the unnecessary material I had left over from my school orientation. All in all, it was a good day. I can live without the T.V. and it seems that it is better that I do live without it while I'm doing my Msc. I seem to get more done in a day :)  An added interesting thing that happened today was that my amigo Dave showed me some pics of when he and Kevin (the pilot) went flying last Saturday. First let me say congrats to Kev cause dude loves the sky and I'm happy to see him with the clouds! Dave, you punk, keep the pics coming man!  Here's a sample of some of the shots:                         To see more of these pics, just visit  urlLink  here   and you can view the collection.

       Today marks the end of international student orientation at school. I must say it was quite good and very informative. It's funny how no matter where you go, administration is always a complex thing. However, I must say my experience with the administration here was a lot better than I experienced in my previous university. It might have something to do with the attitude of the personnel. These folks were quite polite and friendly, not to mention the people that were waiting as well. I guess us Jamaicans aren't the most patient in the world so we probably complicate things because of that lack of patience. Possible, I guess.

        What a weekend! This has got to be one of the craziest weekends I've had in a long time. All this so I could get to Grad School in time for orientation which is going very well so far! Alot better than other orientations I've experienced.       The journey seemed simple. Get a flight out of Jamaica, go to New York, then head to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I've got an open ticket and plans for the trip in the US. Everything should work ... right?!      Well the first problem that occurred was this tropical storm soon to be hurricane named Charley. Charley arrived in Jamaica on Wednesday August 11, 2004 and basically shut down all operations in the island. Operations inclusive of the airport and the US Embassy. This delayed me because I couldn't get my student visa on the Wednesday that I should have got it and also the airport delays caused flights from Wednesday to be pushed over into Thursday which made booking a confirmed seat verrrry difficult. My travel agent's response? Your best bet is to do a stand-by at the airport and hope you get onto a flight Friday morning. Damn!!      Friday August 13,2004. I got to the airport at 3am so that I could hopefully be the first stand-by flyer which would greatly increase my chances of getting on the flight I needed to catch. As i pull in to the departure lounge, I find I'm the only one there and the check-in attendants are present. Great! I was first :) While waiting on the flight, I meet this guy that has been on stand-by for the last 3 days to go to Canada. Of course this does not give me much faith that I would get through either, but I say nothing. Cross my fingers. I tell the guy not to worry much, he should watch the movie "Terminal" starring Tom Hanks. He might find it funny :).   6:45am, 15 minutes before departure time I hear my name called. I'm happy, this means I'm getting on the 7am flight to Miami that continue to New York. I made it!       We land in Miami where I have to catch a connecting flight to New York. Boarding time for the new flight approaches and I make my way to the Terminal. Now this very attractive Puerto Rican miss asks for my boarding pass. I realize I only have the one given to me in Jamaica. She notices too and says I need to get one for my trip to New york and directs me to the ticket counter to speak to another young miss. This one is Italian. She looks good as well but is a bit older. A problem now arises because I was on stand-by in Jamaica, I have no confirmed seat on the connecting flight. Here we go again! Being blessed with a technical mind, I proceed to ask some questions to try and get to a solution. Myself and my new Italian friend start to go thru some possibilities. One one point she stops, gives me a big smile, and starts typing like crazy. Bear in mind the flight leaves in 20 mins. 5 minutes passes and my Italian friend says "You are a lucky fellow", to which I reply, "Not at all, just tired and protected by the G-O-D". She hands me my boarding pass and I'm off on my merry way to my NY flight.       Wait .. there is more!       I haven't slept since 2am. It's Friday evening around 5pm. I get to my Aunt's place and meet up with family and give them the drama in a little more detail than I tell you of now. Mind you, these family gatherings will take time and I don't finish till about 10pm the Friday night.       The trip is not over yet though, I still have to get to Pittsburgh for school! Pittsburgh is 6hrs drive away, 7hrs by train, and 7-8hrs by bus. Seeing that I love to drive and not very slowly, I opt for the car drive. That's the 6 hour journey. The really cool part about it is that I get to drive an SUV, something I've never driven before. The SUV we get at 3am Saturday morning from the rental company is a Ford Explorer. The interior is very nnice as is the exterior. Seats are comfy and the ride is cool. The only problems is that the CD player won't work. That's ok, we have Hot 97.7 that plays Hip-Hop and R&B all day. Sounds good to me!       We pack up all the goodies into the SUV and start our trek to Pittsburgh at 6am Saturday morning. There is one thing I have to love about the US. It's so easy to navigate. Their mapping systems are up-to-date and the highways and major roads are taken care of. Makes for a lovely driving experience. With my cuz as navigator and MSN providing our route and me as driver we set off on the journey to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately there is no camera :(       After 6 hours inclusive of two gas stops of about 15-20 mins each we get to Pittsburgh. It's an interesting town to say the least. The scenery changes from an industrial look to a more modern, greener look as you head nearer to CMU. There are alot of restaurants around of all different cultures. Asian influence seems quite strong here. The indian population is also of reasoanble strength. There are a few African American faces but not many as I move closer toward the school area. There were alot more on the outskirts if the school area. First impressions are quite good, nothing that is a turn-off has presented itself so far.       I eventaully find my apartment and start the moving process. That though, is another tale I will leave for another day.

        Why is it that when you have something really important to do some crap comes along and just messes up plans? If this kind of thing happens all the time then we can call it a pattern, better yet a life pattern. Now seeing that this is a pattern, that should make it predictable. If something is predictable, then one should be able to plan for this anomoly correct?       This is starting to sound like a conversation with the Architect from the Matrix. Maybe the Matrix is real. I think I'm living in it. Where are you Morpheus?!

        Here's one of those classics people in customer support have to go through. Just makes you want to do something to somebody!        Personal Information By Gordon Regar    Caller on my helpline: "Hello. My computer is broken. Can you help me please?"   I answer: "Yes, I would be glad to help you. What is your name?"   Caller: "I won't tell you that."   Me: "Can you tell me what branch office you are in?"   Caller: "I am not going to tell you that either."   Me: "What type of equipment are you using?"   Caller: "No, I won't tell you that either."   Me: "Why won't you tell me these things?"   Caller: "I have been told not to give out any company or personal information over the phone."

       I was just reading one of my  urlLink favorite magazines  online and then remembered that I have it sitting on my desk in print. So the thought comes to mind, which is better or more useful, Print or the Electronic version?  Personally I prefer print because I can take it with me anywhere .. duh! ... but the electronic version I tend to read when I want a reference or I'm just surfing the web and want to do a little reading. As for which I find more readable, I would have to say the Electronic version. I like the idea of having all the content in front of me and not having to turn a page.  Coincidentally just as I'm posting this blog, I encounter this neat item, an eBook,  urlLink Successful Integration: Putting It All Together  . Now this I like, an Electronic item that gives you the feel of Print. This I have to check out!  More info comes later ...

       Why must moving be so tedious, you never really realize how much "stuff" is around until you are ready to move. I wonder if passing my laptop through the X-Ray machines at the airport will damage it?
