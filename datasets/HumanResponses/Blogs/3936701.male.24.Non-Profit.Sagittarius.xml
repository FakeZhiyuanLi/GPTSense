      I have no idea where I am going, nor do I have any clue where I just came from.  All I know at this point is that I am so cold and the air is so thin that I am relying on all my training to survive.  At this point, my mind has taken the backseat and pure survival instinct has taken over.  I do not know when this entry will be entered but if you are reading this, you can assume that I have lived long enough to reach base camp.  All I can think about at this point is to getting to base camp, crawl into my battered down sleeping bag - that is, if our expedition tent hasn't blown away.    Sometimes just thinking about that nice warm place with satalite uplink to enter this blog just gives me the strength to hope for another night up here.  To fill you in, I am writing this at about 21,600 ft.  We have spent the last week trying to return from "village 469" (sorry about the ambiguous name for the sake of these people who risk their lives for what they believe in this "closed" country).  Although it was a relief to make such a large "drop off" of materials and stuff, we had to risk not having enough supplies because of weight and space.  It was worth it to spend this precious time with our high-altitude friends.  I fear for my team, although I know it's all going to be ok - it always works out.  Praise God.  Right now 2 guys have mild frost bite and I don't know how long they can hold out before not being able to continue walking.  We are trying to wait out this little western breeze for hopes that by daybreak the passes will be clear to make the 2 day trip back across the border and to our base camp.    Sometimes the people in these villages believe that these western winds carry leprosy or something... what it is is basically people getting frost bite from the cold.  Some call this place "the roof of the world"... a place where one is closer to the "heavens".  Now I know why people that come through these parts feel this way... probably because they're freezing to death.  Ha.  Hey, at least my Mac has enough battery juice to keep me company.  As I finish writing this, the sound of nice instrumental music balances quite nicely the intimadating winds trying to pick up my tent.  It's a nice feeling to know that you may not wake up, but hey, praise Jesus.

						   Have you ever looked outside your window in the break of dawn, with the light still fresh in your eyes, and wonder, "how in the world did I get here?"  You can't remember what day it is or what country you're in; the last memory seemed to be what you dreamed a few hours ago as you passed out from exhaustion.  The weird part is, sometimes there's not even a window, in fact, you're not even sleeping in a house or a buildin - while the clothes that you're wearing can hardly be called fashionable and your first waking instinct is "don't forget to shake the scorpions out of your boots..."  The first faces you see are neither the aboriginal nomads of Afghanistan, nor the bike-riding hip Dutch, nor the Ukrainian supermodels but the ever present companions to which our lives are forever hinged - my team.  To my end, i write and cannot escape.  With that, let me introduce you to my life, my cross, my joy and my endless odyssey into the life of World Missions.  Some say we do more Special Operations, but I say, the only time you know you're truly alive is when you think you're just about to die.

      Jaap died early this morning at 4am.  He had an accelerated form of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema.  I should have caught it earlier when I realized the barometric pressure had dropped to 421 mmHg.  We tried to give him what was left of our Dexamethasone, but it just wasn't fast enough.  We ran out of O2 about 2 days ago.  This is a great loss.  What am I going to tell him mum...  At least we know he's with the Lord and there's no other place he would rather be finished then here.  We're going to try to bury his body in an ice crevace on our decent - whenever that is.  We have to get out of here asap.

      White.  All white.  I'm sick of seeing white.  Any other color right now would be great except white.  The sky is white with the falling snow - that is, if you can call it "falling" when it is driving into your face like mosquitos in the amazon.  From the outside you can't even tell our tent is yellow, then again, you can't even tell it's a tent.  We have been at base camp near "dehra," but still many clicks away, for close to a week now - stranded by the wall of snow, wind and ice.  Even if we tried to walk down to our pick up LZ, we have no idea which direction to even try to go.  The genious of our team used the batteries for our GPS system for his electric socks two nights ago and by the time he realized what he did, the batteries were as dead as a deaf yak in New York.  But the team figured that if we couldn't last any longer that he'd be the first guy we'd eat.  Good and tender back muscles, you know.  Most everyone's attitudes are great, the weather is showing signs of breaking soon and we've got enough food for at least another few days. Although, sometimes, I wish I can just press pause on the yappers.    I have not heard back from our other team which was supposed to meet up with us here from the east face.  They went to check out an area that we have not been yet.  All we know of these villages are what we saw from the satalite photos taken earlier last spring.  For all I know they could be out getting a cappuccino.  That's the last thing I would do on a night like this even if I had the chance.  Sometimes there's nothing sweeter than getting away from the group and just hanging with the Father.  The sound of the wind is like a clock ticking away through the night.  Hawaii does sound nice at this point, even a nice weekend gettaway to Egypt for the low price of 399 euro all inclusive with hotel.  As it is, we are sticking this weather out - it's not like we can just quit now and decide to get on the next train to the airport and fly home to sweet sweet America.  But then again...  Well, I think yak ribs are on the menu tonight.  It does't get any better than that.
