      I think I'm safe in saying most people have zero knowledge of what one must go through to become a dentist.  For the record,it ain't easy, but neither is pimpin' (long-live Ice Cube).  I'll bet you go to your dentist every 6 months and have your own little opinions about him/her, and if a friend of your's married a dentist you'd nod approvingly knowing the financial security would be set, and you look around his/her office thinking "So this is where my money goes..."  In case you feel like expanding your basic knowledge of the world around you, here's the quick-and-dirty version of what it takes to cut it as a dentist:  1. you have to be in touch with your inner nerd.  our outer if you prefer. i am of the 1st order, and an extreme rarity amongst my colleagues.  2. you have to like science.  a lot.    3. you have to be smart enough to realize the most well-kept secret [that is dentistry] while all your "smart" classmates in college are trying to get into med school. silly fools.  why have a boss and pay millions in malpractice insurance when you could work for yourself and enjoy your life friday through sunday???  4. you have to posess technical skills, manual dexterity and agility.  a lot.  5. you do NOT have to be able to relate to other human beings socially.  i am an exception on this topic also...really makes me an outcast in my class.  apparently fun is illegal in dental school.  6. you have to be willing to work your ass of in college, and then even harder in dental school: 30 hours of class a semester, the most difficult subject matter biology has to offer, hours spent on labwork, dealing with the most unhealthy and/or difficult persons you will ever meet as patients, all so you can be accused of "not being able to hack it at med school."    Which reminds me... I am SO amused by the dicotomy of dentist/medical doctor.  Here's the line up: Our first 2 years of school are identical; only when we get clinical does it differ.  Your dentist knows every disease that was ever diagnosed and how it's treated, he knows about the entire body, not just the head and neck.  So you see how one may feel that they are never getting the respect they deserve...which creates this "almighty" attitude in some of my classmates.  that's the funny part to me.  i could care less if you think what you think, but these guys are convinced they are the smartest, most deserving human beings on the planet, at which point i have to say, "uh, hello!  you are a DENTIST, you do not save people's lives on a daily basis (but don't forget oral cancers, thank you seinfeld), so just keep up the Campaign against Tooth Decay, alright???"  i love what i do...even if no one out there understands that.  :)
