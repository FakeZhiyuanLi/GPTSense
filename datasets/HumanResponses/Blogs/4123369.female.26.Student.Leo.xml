						   My group members don't know up to what again. Yesterday one by one tell me maybe not coming to class. End up all came except eric. Fed up with them. Heck care abt them. I won't put in too much effort in my BD. No matter how much effort I put in, they wont accept. My introduction, they delete all, used eric's old one. Teacher already said introduction & evaluation of biz is one page Yati go and do 1 and 1/2 page, end up not enough space. Its either her brain and reny's brains got problems.  I told them pearlyn said, webcam childcare centers singapore have. Reny still uses webcam as our main enhanced features. Then powerpoint slides I completed on monday, but Yati asked me to  wait for eric, because need to insert charts. because yesterday I didnt go, she kept rushing me for the powerpoint slides. I very fed up, I just sent the slides to her without the charts and graphs. She want charts and graphs, she can insert it herself.  The report 1st draft, I saw got grammer mistakes and lots of error.  But I kept quiet, last time the UCCD group project I also kept quiet. Dora told them, report grammer must correct. hahaha When I offered to help, they don't appreciate. What for I go and busybody. Yati kept insisting citation I must put in. But how. Eric always not around Eric is doing the list of references.  Everything is with him. Today really moody, not going to talk to them. I hope.

						   Today woke up late, at around 12 noon plus plus. Then whole body no mood to move, so snail around the house for a while. Watched the Olympics Athens, my eyes were glued to the TV. I am no sports person or exercise person. But instead I am so interested  in the Olympics. Daydreaming away infront of the TV too. *Sigh*  After Financial Management Class, now at efac doing my e-commerce project part A. ....................Headache Don't really know how to go about. I even promised Irfan to collect data on hairsalons' pricing for him. As a favour, gosh even my horoscope for the week advised me to help others. For I might benefit from it all, I don't care about the benefits I am only afraid if I don't help. Grudges might be bear against me. What to do......... Really like an orange in a foodprocessor, chopped up and diced nicely. Really cold in the efac lab, fingers are getting number by the min. Going off soon.

						   Friday I started coughing slightly, on off slight fever. I thought it would just wear off by itself. Then Saturday, fever, headache, cough, sore throat.  Woke up with bodyaches, still I did not take any medications. I just took some herbal tea and drunk more water. Slept more than usual. Then came Sunday was suppose to meet reena at 1pm at City hall, the night before I took two biogetics, my mom's sore throat medication.  I could hardly swallow any water, because my throat hurts badly. Every few hours I would rinse my mouth with listrine.  One big full bottle, what's left is just 15% in two days. Monday meeting Reena at Tiong Bahru plaza to get back my business development surveys but fever came back.  Really horrible experience, I nearly had the impulse of drinking down the remains of the Listrine to kill germs. haha Just an impulse too bad. It still hurts now.  But I have no time to go to the doctors, due to the multiple deadlines by my two group members. Really headache............... At leasts I was a sleeping beasts from Saturday to Monday, was nearly sleeping 18 hours average.  Monday morning I woke up early, throat still hurts had to force liquid down my throat.  I slept less than 4 hours but I did not feel any tiredness, maybe because of my ample of rest during the holidays. Maybe later will go clementi to buy some off the shelf medications.

						   After Friday's E-commerce class, Joanna was not around. So was Irfan.... I went to the toilet at Dover MRT, I thought that Edmund and Yinnee won't wait for me, because they normally don't. When I came out of the toilet happily, but saw them there at a corner waiting. My mood swiftly turned heavy. After Yinnee alighted at Clementi, between the journey from Clementi to Jurong East seems a long time. It was embrassing, I and Edmund did not chat. I tried to find a topic to chat with him. Like where does he live, Edmund just reply  Jurong East lor.  He is really a man of a few words. I really never had a decent conversation with him before in my entire 4 years of education in Singapore Polytechnic. I nearly wanted to faint. I kept looking at my watch, praying in my heart MRT faster MRT faster reach Jurong East. I swear during that short journey inbetween was a stand still in time. This is the longest and unbearable MRT journey in my whole damn life.

						   Yesterday was supposed to go for an interview at British Council at 11am. But I did not sleep well, slept only 3 hours. Bodyaching, mom gave her crappy irritating nagging as usual. Then worst felt feverish, polytechnic school fees payment slip came. Have to make payment on 7th of August. Wow, only 3 days to dig out the money. So I postpone the interview to 4pm. Tried to catch up on my sleep, slept till 2pm. Woke up less feverish and less bodyaches. But head was heavy or bloated as if going to burst. Movement was damn slow, bathing, makeup. Aiya! Finally threw in the towel to gave up. Cause really no energy, called the agency to postpone to Friday 11am Gave a stupid lame excuse about lecturer wanting to see me.  Friday, woke up 8.45am. Was in a normal mood but my mom had to give me crap again. I was really in a bad mood, so I lecturer her. I told her the reports I had to complete by next week. Supply Chain Management, I had to write report on Market size and share. A bit on logistics and shipping, her eyes opened wide. Then I go on with my Business Development, I had to write introduction on our childcare center start up project and business ethics on childcare. She was finding hard to absorb. Then I carried on, on E-commerce, I had to write report on Companies that  provide online music downloads their success and failure.... The list is long, by then her eyes and mouth were wide opened. My mom always underestimate what I meant by busy and stress. She kept saying no one gave me stress. Will the truth is my main source of stress came from her. Ironic but true, the other sources of stress are friends, school, finding jobs and housework.  My mom then bullshit rebut me, saying that what does my lecturer do if we are doing so much.  Hey come on lar! We students are the one getting the diploma, not the lecturers.  Really cannot stand her arrogance and ignorance.  Then her bullshitting continues, what about your group members! Why are they pushing all the work to you!  I was nearly at a stage of vomiting blood... I told her off, we distributed the work evenly. I told you right, my projects will be a lot and heavy. This shows how big is one subject's project is!  She of course was shock but *sigh* she still want to argue.  Sometimes I wonder am I the Parent or the Child.  Anyway, today my interview I was darn late cause the 106 bus was really snailing on the road.  I saw cars, lorries, trucks, vans, buses drove pass the bus I am on...  Really snail. So I got there late around 12pm.    Why was I that late?  I left home around 10:40am, reach bukit batok interchange at 11am.  Miss a 106 bus, the bus schedule said 106 will leave at  11:05am but it was late, cause it arrived at 11:10am. Then it snail along the road.............. I panicked, alighted at the wrong bus stop, one bus stop before the actual one. Reached there, it was lunch time. I was told to come back at 1pm plus. Took my lunch at Tanglin Mall Mcdonald's.  1pm plus, interview delayed cause the HR person not around. So a last min person was there to interview me. Then due to my lack of expertise in Access software, in 10 mins I was rejected!!!!  Wow....Really so crappy today.

						   Yesterday, meeting was okay. I was shock that Yatie and Reny had already drew up schedule for the Business Development Phase 1 of the project. Eric was already starting to discuss and plan the Phase 2 of the project. I was thinking "Hey, quite cool. Your really committed into your job." That really rest my mind abit. I was kinda relax and calm, seeing Yatie and Reny scheduling was perfect and fair. And Eric was already planning ahead, Pang was eager to complete his tasks. At this pace, there should not be any delays or problems.  Before the meeting, I was really thinking about the  on coming CA tests and the other projects. But since SCM's Part one project is almost done. Just leaving the ECOM part, I had been updating the Forum posting to my word doc. For the convenient of my other group members. If they don't mind, maybe that part could be included in the appendixes. Just to show, we did read everything. And the extra efforts we putted in.  My head still feels heavy and cloudy, body's okay, make up is even more okay. I think I looked great other than the head heaviness.

						   The night before, My mom had to lecture, scold, insult me. How to sleep?! I was trying to clear my mind. I was trying to relax, so that I could ease up to dreamland. I was really upset, she did these everyday. Why can't she leave me alone! Does she think I am really the person that she accuse me to be! I am not,  I am quiet because I am thinking. I chat online because I am distracting myself from project stress. I talk on phone because my friends are too busy to chat with me and my own mom would not even talk to me.  I think I might explode. I have to deal with projects, lessons, finding jobs, friendship issues, group members' issues.  Why does she enjoy making me sad, upset, hurt..... Its bad enough that she does not spare me any of her considerations, understanding, concern, love, motivation, respect, peace and trust. Instead she shower me with hate, disappointment, anger, insults, mocking, chaos...... I am only human, I really really need mental rest. Please leave me alone. I am trying so hard to keep up, and perform but I end up with no life.  Still she tortures me. She screams at my ears, now my ears suffers from constant pain, ringing and they are no longer strong. No one believes me, my mom is really horrible. But no one believes me. They think I am seeking attention. I tried to be a good person but she and her sisters still despise me. I feel like a stray, slave, servant in their presence. I am really so tired, so lonely, so wounded. Years of abuse, the wounds does not heal easily and fast. Old wounds are again tored up by my mom. She enjoys bringing up past issues that I tried to forget. Am I really that a person she said I am?

						   So tired, Yet I can't sleep. So weak,  Yet I can't rest. So stressed out, Yet I can't relax. I stare into darkness, waiting for sandman to come. Only at dawn, That I will sleep. Only at day,  That I will rest. Only at sunrise, That I will relax. I cried into noon, waiting for life to come. Why can't I hope for hopes, Cause Despair came. Why can't I seek for seeks Cause Lost came. Why can't I dream for dreams, Cause Dreamcatcher came.

						   During school days, I treated her as my little friend. One whom I would protect and respect. I taught her passion, friendship and love. After graduation, she went to nanyang polytechnic. She was slacking and lacking. I pushed her, made her stand, but she slack. She enjoyed life, attentions and activities. I was scared, but I am glad to see her happy. I was scared she might not want me. After polytechnic, she worked. She felt empty, she felt lacking in closeness with her co-workers. I comforted her, encouraged her. Perk her up with motivations. She was later busy with activities with her co-workers. I felt left out, I miss doing stuff with her. I voiced out, but I was mistaken for having no other friends to be with. Still I wanted to be part of her life. I would make effort to invite her out to do stuff that we used to enjoy. At the eleventh hour she would either forgotten about our plans, or she would cancel it to make time for her other friends. I was of course sad and disappointed, I grumbled and complained. But still I miss her. I would share my joy and sadness with her, she used to share with me hers. Slowly as we matured, She drifted away from us. She would gave us the lowest priority, I would always be placed on the waiting list. I cried and was confused, did I do anything wrong? Was I so undesirable as her Friend? But still at my lowest hour, I would go to her  and she would come to me at her lowest point. Things went really bad after she met John........

						   I sometimes miss him. I would pretend that I did not see him, even though I know he is there. I would glance around to seek him. But I pretend I was just curious about my surroundings. When he smiles at me, my heart would flutter in silence. His sms messages and emails are treasures to me. I would read them over and over again, as they provide me strength and motivation for the days ahead. He might not know, but I do hold his happiness dear to my heart.
