      Business analysis, although interesting, is very painstaking task. Few months back, I&nbsp;developed a strategic plan for my company, using facts and figures of the industry. It was very interesting to note how all the financial parameters are interlinked and how changing one parameters affects others. Moreover, my educational background, electronics engineering, doesn't help me much in dealig with finance. Although, in last two years of experience, I now believe that all you need to know is basic mathematics and some statistics. However, you need to be an expert in MS Office package! Thats all you&nbsp;need to have in your toolbox.  Indeed,&nbsp;business analysis&nbsp;requires a good understanding of business profile. Business management is more abstract than&nbsp;mathematics or other sciences. Nonethless, many people try to come up with financial models&nbsp;using EVA, FCF etc. Admittedly, I personally don't see any great relation in practical market. The mathematics behind these finalcial models is indeed very promising and logical. More on that later.  Today, my boss told me to collect some data on&nbsp;demographic profile of India. The&nbsp;goal - to&nbsp;justify annual market growth of 12-15% in medical devices sector. Frankly speaking, we do not have any official source in India to verify our raw data, which are provided by our sales engineers. In management jargon, we do not have a reliable source of information. (unless data is verified, you cannot trust it. Moreover, it should be owned by companies like F&S etc.) I've heard some people&nbsp;telling that even these&nbsp;data management companies modify the previous data on excel, rather than doing a fresh market research. I wonder how McKinsey has created a big report on prospects of Indian healthcare for the next decade. They have even come up with a figure, 12-15% growth rate. My problem is to&nbsp;prove that they did their homework correctly. Not fair!  Anyway, coming back to market sizing, I have to arrive at a figure (or atleast a range). Today, I have collected the information regarding indian demographic profile, effective growth rate, Indian Govt's plan to spend on Healthcare, Number of hospitals in India etc.  Unfortunately,&nbsp;I do not know how to work upon these data to calculate market growth rate. I have never given it a serious thought as well. Why? Because unless I am confident that the data is sufficient, I don't get myself started. So, some data&nbsp;must be&nbsp;missing. (what a poor argument!)  ...period...

      "The Study of an academic discipline alters the way we percieve the world. After Studying the discipline we see the same world as before."  The issue raises an apparent paradox. First, it asserts that the study of an academic discipline alters the way we perceive the world.&nbsp;Then, after studying the discipline we see the world as before. I strongly believe that this is not true. I will explain my argument in the following:  For a&nbsp;child, the world is very strange. He perceives the world with no experience. For him, whatever is visible, is his world, if we agree that a child can think of "world". In fact, he doesn't know or rather doesn't have the knowledge about the world. As he grows older, he starts learning,&nbsp;gathers experiences, learns from his mistakes and starts to know about the world quickly. He applies his knowledge to unfold the world before him.   After a while, his studies&nbsp;gets over. Although his studies gets over, he doesn't start viewing the world in the same way as before. In fact, he cannot perceive in that manner. Now, he has knowledge and he knows about many things. He cannot perceive that the world is as small as is visible to him.

      Hmm...I'm back! But this time I've got&nbsp;a purpose.&nbsp;   I have another&nbsp;two months to go before my GMAT, and to do well in AWA, I need to prepare atleast a bit! Hence&nbsp;I'm here, on&nbsp;blog, to help me achieve my sort term goal. Admittedly, I need to brush up my writing skills. (rather say develop!).&nbsp;   I'll write mostly about the stuffs related to GMAT topics, but will also try to include some other stuffs.   Thats all!   ----Shoot for the moon...Even if you fail, you'll land up among stars!----
