      im sorry i havent blog in awhile but its been a very sad week for me and alot of other ppl.Tony Chanale Trimew has past on to a better place and left us all behind with his memorys.i will miss him very much he was very close to my heart .considering him and my brother were really good friends!! pray for anyone who knew tony bcuss some ppl arent taking it very well at all..the funeral was awful his mother just broke down and was saying"why my babi pls just give me my babi back"and"i love my babi i love you tony"and"why couldnt it have just been me and not my babi"it was awful pray for her please she needs it..pray for malory and jj and toehead they arent taking it ever good either  i will miss you babi tony:'( rip..i love you like a brother

      *!*This Is In Loving Memory Of Tony Trimew*!* Tony was a great little boy.He was very respectfull and loving.He was like another little brother to me i loved him so much he was a sweet heart.I remeber when him and toehead would sitt on tha pc and listen to music.They were insperable.But Now Everything Has Changed Tony Has Passed On To Hevan And Me In Tohead will miss him so much.Tony was hit by a transfer truck.Him and some other boys where playing chicken to see who could get across the road first but tony didnt make it he was hit.the other boys tryed to tell him he wouldnt make it but tony was like any other boy he wanted to do it to prove he was just as good as they were.I Remeber when Tony would tell Toehead how cute he thought i was.I will really really miss him :( .Tony i hope you rest in peace!I Love You Like A Brother!"tony you will always be my best and craziest friend i will miss you and love you forever"toehead" -from amber and toehead-
