      I had such a great weekend!  After a couple dozen tries (training runs plus customer runs), I finally got the most difficult rapid that I lead through down!  It probably wasn't picture perfect, but it still felt good to finally "get it".  I'll post a photo when I get it so you can see the before (my first run with customers) versus the now.  An added bonus for the trip was that it was my 12th day in a row without having anyone fall out of my raft.  At ZOAR if you go 12 days without a "swimmer" (what we call it when someone falls out) then you earn a free shirt.  AND...I also was able to self rescue (pull myself back in the raft).  I had trouble with self rescuing in training as it requires a lot of upper body strength.  In one of the swim spots nobody in my raft wanted to go in (it was cold and rainy that day), so in an effort to keep the kids spirits up I asked them if they wanted to try and knock me in the water.  Of course they succeeded...that was the plan all along:).  I figured as long as I was having a great day that I'd go for the trifecta and try and pull myself in.  Any one of these three things would've made my weekend, to have all three in one day has a perma-grin on my face.  Unfortunately my luck didn't hold out when I bought a lottery ticket that evening (had to try with the day I'd been having).  All of this was on Saturday.  Sunday Larry and I both didn't have to work so we went and watched the advanced trip for rafting and then hiked up Mt. Negus in Florida, MA (elev 1,772 ft...a rise of approximately 1,100 ft from where we began the hike).  It was a hellish hike for me as its a lot of up and I'm not to big on up.  He and I had done the hike back in Nov/Dec of 2003 and I wasn't able to finish.  I made it this time!  Great view up there.  From the top we could see Berkshire East, Mt. Greylock (the tallest mtn in MA at 3,491 feet), Bear Swamp (a local hydroelectric facility), and the river that I guide on.

      To see who can send me a postcard from the most interesting location.  I collect postcards and have them from all over the world,  I  think  every continent...even Antarctica.  I have no idea what the contest winner will get for a prize.  I'll have to think about that one.   Postcards can be sent to:  Rena Chadwick 2 Manor House Ct Holyoke, MA 01040

       For those that don't know, on the weekends I do whitewater rafting with Zoar Outdoor in Charlemont, MA. Thats Zoar, not Crab Apple Whitewater. Friends and family of mine seem to be going with Crabby this season...including my grandfather who went today. If you want to go, you should go with Zoar. We let you paddle through the Gap (a Class 3 rapid), Crabby yells "Hold on! Hold on!" What is the fun in that?       The "handsome fella" (a quote from Gramma Chadwick) in the drivers seat of the raft in the photo (see previous post) is my boyfriend of nearly 10 months, Larry. I was dropped from work the day of the photo and tagged along with him for fun. For fun. Going on a raft in a raging river is fun to me. Really. Even more fun is when your friend is learning a new rapid in APRIL in LOWELL, MA (quite the urban wasteland for those that don't know) and you end up in the river. Actually, compared to training in March the water wasn't that cold.      Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about rafting, Zoar, Larry...whatever.      Take care,   Rena

      This is my first attempt at blogging.  Just want to see if this works.  I figure this might be a way to keep friends and family that I don't see that often in touch with what I'm up to.  Rena
