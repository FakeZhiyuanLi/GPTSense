      Finally have gotten around to sharing my trip photos. See many posts under this. Mark and I went to Egypt last month (April 2004) for 2 weeks and it was really a great trip.  This is just a selection as I don't have all day to put them on here!  In fact I now have to go clean some walls to finally apply some tiles to the separate toilet, which will coordinate to the bathroom (these are in different rooms upstairs in this house, no idea why).  Mark has spent all day removing the old pink (ugh!) toilet and moving a drain pipe.  Like hours it has taken.  We can't tile the bathroom itself until next week as we have to wait for a plasterer to do some work, and he's coming Tuesday.  Fun times.

      The DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) in this country is REALLY dumb.  They have figured out that most Canadians drive automatics, and so have restricted Canadians driving in the UK to only automatic cars unless you can prove with documentation that you passed your Canadian test on a manual car.  HOWEVER, they have not clued up to graduated licencing.  I exchanged a G2 Ontario licence for a full UK licence! ha ha!  The best part is that my G2 was going to expire this October, meaning if I didn't take a full G test in Ontario, I was going to be reduced to a G1 again.  And now if I go back to Canada, I can either get a G2 or a G licence automatically by exchanging my shiny new one (depending on how many year's driving experience I get here).  I just got it today.  So alas Mark's car is manual.  But at least I can drive a moped or a quad bike in the UK legally!  Not that I am planning to.

      This morning, in the free paper on the tube, the Metro (very high quality newspaper, ha ha), there was a whole feature on Canadian cuisine!  Excellent.  I actually asked Mark yesterday if he would be willing to skip off work one day next week for a 2 course lunch for Â£40 at Fortnum & Mason (the Queen's grocer of course, you know) cooked by the head chef from the Royal York.  It's some special thing in conjunction with an exhibit of Inuit art.  But alas I don't think we're going.  We probably would if it was a weekend.  We picked some decent tiles last night for the new bathroom, after much debate.  I think they will be okay.  It's more important that we make it look good for potential buyers anyway, not for ourselves.  Current good read on the tube to and from work: another brilliant book by Dave Eggers, called You Shall Know Our Velocity.   Great quote:  But I was getting tired.  We needed to get out of the water before we mistook it for a bed.  I was sure that was how people drowned; not with a fight, not with thrashing but with thoughts of rest.  I have always thought that!

      Still warm here, still hasn't rained.  And just when I finally get some dirt under my fingernails and want it to rain on my nice herbs and tomatoes!  We are growing basil, coriander, thyme, wild rocket, mint, sage and more.  They are looking pretty good too.  I never started growing anything from seed before.  So I took a little trip out to try to find the set of 'Nanny McPhee' urlLink  , which is Colin Firth and Emma Thompson's latest movie, filming in a little town not too far away from here called Penn Street.  But we got all the way out there and it was closed and I was scared off by people guarding the entrance so I chickened out and we went to a pub instead.  Oh well.  I have now seen Colin loads of times around London, so I am not actually all that disappointed, but it would have been cool to see.  And Emma T. too.  Putting in new bathroom this weekend which is very exciting, and Mark actually put the house on the market yesterday.  He says he is testing the waters to see if he gets any offers at a high asking price.  I say NO ONE is going to buy this place, there is too much work to be done!  So we are at least starting to do the work now.

      It's too hot here already and it's only mid May.  Of course, however, everyone in London cynically says that this week could be it for summer.  This country suffers from not having the four distinct seasons we get in Canada.  In the UK, you just don't know what you are going to get at any time of the year.  But for now, it's gross.  The tube is the worst.  And air conditioning just doesn't exist so you walk around never quite feeling fresh except when you are lucky enough to catch a breeze somewhere.  Busy week at work as it's Adult Learner's Week (exhibiting some batik work done in my community courses), and am doing some teaching too, on how to vote in the local elections here next month.  We bought a new bathroom last night which I am really excited about as I want to gut this house, and it's a start.  The original bath and sink and tiles from like the 1940's are still here and they need to go!  We got a relatively cheap suite, but upgraded to some better taps for a fancier touch.  And we are going to cover the walls in large white tiles but put some kind of band of mosaic through it.  Haven't bought the rest of the stuff yet, will do that when we know when B&Q are delivering it.  There is loads to do in the house and at least for once we are not just planning it out, we are going to do it very soon!  Emma and Mark from Wales are going to be in London tomorrow so hopefully we will arrange to meet up at least for dinner tomorrow night.  I am bummed since I found out only today about Rufus Wainwright and his family playing here next week, and it's completely sold out.  Apparently there might be some returns but I don't think I will be very lucky.  He's actually fairly well known here, which is great for him but not so good for me!  Crap, am missing Eastenders!  Gotta run to tv.

      Well thank god the Conservatives did not win, no matter what happened...  I wasn't going to apply for our team manager's job posting that came up, but Mark convinced me last night that maybe I should reconsider as (a) my current acting boss wants me to apply and said when I wasn't going to that I was the standard to which other applicants will be judged! and (b) it could look good for the future, such as for going back to Canada, that I have been promoted to supervise my team and more.  Well I am not convinced I want it, but the deadline was today and I very hastily put an application together.  I wanted to talk to my boss more about it but she isn't available today.  We'll see what happens.  It's much less pressure than when I applied for this job, of course, as if I don't get it, I don't really care as I am actually pretty happy with where my postion is going currently.  Am not going to freak out or worry cause I wasn't even going to go for it, and was happy not to.  England is out of the football (Euro 2004) so now everyone is focussed on Henman at Wimbledon...  Nightmare tomorrow - 24 hour tube strike, which actually starts after work tonight.  I am going to have to take like 3 buses to get to work, and it could take me 2-3 hours to get in depending on what the roads are like.  And they are likely to be bad as everyone will be driving or bussing it!  I should take a day off but I have an important meeting.  Canada Day in 2 days, trying to make some plans with Dena as to what we should do.  There is cake at Canada House and more as the evening progresses.  This year I have some Roots gear my aunt and uncle bought me that I would not normally be caught dead in, but it's perfect for the occasion.  We saw Harry Potter on Saturday night finally, god the dementors are scary in that!  Much more than my limited imagination made them reading the books.  We did a BIG ikea shop last night - hurray!  Managed to get a few things to make the house look better for selling presentation (when that comes, one day) and also some stuff for the new bathroom - mirror, glass shelf and little chest of drawers for storage.

      Am sitting at my desk eating yummy cherries and killing some time. I have to work late tonight as I promised to visit a group of volunteers doing painting and decorating training to talk about education opportunities from 5-7 tonight.  But I get a free curry out of it, and for doing my normal job they are giving my work Â£200 that I am hoping to earmark for some other good stuff, so what the hell.  I did manage to register to vote in the federal elections, and yesterday sent off my special ballot.  It's interesting, as I was registered to vote in Oshawa, that they don't send you a ballot with the candidates on it.  In fact you have to determine who your local candidates are for whatever party and write in their name beside 'I VOTE FOR______' on this little slip of paper they send.  Then you put it in about 700 different envelopes for security purposes and mail it off.  Funnily enough the Liberal candidate for Oshawa has actually bothered to send me pamphlets in the mail.  TOO BAD LADY.  I also voted here so I am really living trans-Atlantically right now.  Thankfully the right mayoral candidate won for London ( urlLink Red Ken !)so I think all will be okay here.  And Labour got pummelled in the rest of the elections across the country so perhaps Tony will start re-thinking the path he is on right now.  So NOT a popular guy.  How cool - just announced that Canadian director Atom Egoyan's  urlLink next project  features Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth and starts filming in Toronto at the end of the summer, moving then to London.  Sounds like a great story too.  So much talent - ah, it'll probably all go pear-shaped.  In case you don't know what pear-shaped means... + It has largely been put into circulation by the BBC police series The Bill and research indicates that it began life as London East End (or cockney) slang.  + It probably comes from the notion of a circle gone wrong. A circle is a perfect shape, anything which is clearly not perfect is âa circle gone wrongâ â or, in other words, âgone all pear shapedâ. (thanks to Google for good research results as per usual)

      You know, it really sucks not having internet access at home right now.  I just don't have the time at work to do this blog thing justice.  Mark said he was going to sort it out before he went, and of course it's still busted!  Last night I actually watched the footie at a pub and cheered when England won.  There is seriously something wrong with me.  Okay the story does get a little more understandable when you realise I was at the Canadian pub eating poutine and wings with two girlfriends, but still.  Everyone is really happy here about them getting to the semi finals of Euro 2004, and probably still will be even if Tim Henman screws up at Wimbledon.  Haven't had yummy yummy poutine in ages and it caught up with me a bit...ugh.  Saturday I did a marathon day with Dena - met her at 9am at  urlLink Borough Market  for breakfast and great foodie shopping, then we walked all over the place, ended up shopping for bras in Marks and Spencers at Oxford Circus like 6 hours later.  I felt jet lagged when I got home!  The cat has been super whingey in Mark's absence (missing him more than I am!!) and he is driving me a bit mental.  Although I got some revenge by accidentally pouring flour all over his head the other day.  And he is still a bit greyer than usual (being pure black normally).  Work is busy and getting busier.  I am going to be needing my August holiday by the time it arrives, if I make it there...  Happy Birthday to Christine in Ottawa, cancer girl.  Back to the grindstone...

      Have to recommend this book, which I devoured this week on public transportation -  Astonishing Splashes of Colour  by  urlLink Clare Morrall , which is BRILLIANT.  It's about loss and family and depression but not at all depressing.  And was shortlisted for the Booker Prize too.  Actually I read the winner recently too,  Vernon God Little , and I have to say that I enjoyed this book a lot more.  VGL was interesting but weird.  This one I couldn't put down.  Wow - we have a bathtub in.  Mark worked on it last night from like 5:30pm to 2:00am and then again this morning.  The good news is that we can take showers.  The bad news is that we have to take them with the plug in and then he has to bail out the water.  Gee I wonder how long we will have to live like that.  I did keep telling him that I was going to be pretty useless at helping and he needed to get a neighbour involved, but whatever.  The old extremely heavy and deadly metal bath is stuck in the hallway outside our bedroom where it shall remain for...let's have a guess...3 years?  The slugs are eating all my plants! :-(  Only a few tomatoes and the mint are unscathed, plus some that I cleverly kept inside on the windowsill.  I have to try to save them all now, and probably re-grow some from seed.   The basil was growing like gangbusters but now it's been all chewed on by the gross creatures. Oh well, I need a project anyway.  Thankfully the temp has gone down from 32 to 23, but it's still humid and yuck.

      Okay so I did survive the flight.  I should have posted last night but I had a killer headache yesterday, had a nap after work for 2 hours and then overslept this morning.  No idea why.  We did have a good weekend.  Saturday we arrived in Bembridge around lunchtime, walked about 40 mins from the airfield into the town and checked in to our B&B.  Had lunch at the Crab and Lobster Pub, chilled out for a bit, and then did a HUGE long walk around the coast and into the main part of the town.  Unfortunately we were too late to shop in all the cute little stores, but we waited around and had a nice dinner for such good value compared to London.  Sunday I managed to see a bit of the Queen on Juno Beach with the Canadian veterans on tv, before we checked out of the B&B, and then met one of Mark's work colleagues for a coffee (his mother in law lives in Bembridge and was there for the weekend).  After lunch we took off from the airfield about 2, and had an interesting journey back.  First there were war planes doing acrobatics to the left of us, then we flew over the whole the island and I took some nice aerial photos (including  urlLink Needles , the west edge with chalky white cliffs, pretty cool), and then a big plane called a  urlLink Flying Fortress  from the war flew right underneath us by 500 ft and we didn't see it coming until it was really close by!!  Now we are back in London and it is SOOOOOO hot here.  It's like 29 or 30 both today and yesterday, and no air conditioning or wind and it's terrible.  Probably why I had such a headache yesterday. Mark is meant to be tiling but it's like too hot to work.  I am at work waiting for a colleague to arrive so we can plan out a big meeting we have on Thursday.  I am launching a new program of housing estate-based learning for adults, to train people to be involved in their own neighbourhood's regeneration and renewal.  Catchy Labour government phrases there.  Anyway, it should be good as it will involve teaching people to be more involved in community activities, the importance of voting and understanding government, and more.  I am really hoping to teach some of that.  I will be teaching a short course this summer, a few week's at a women's hostel, a literacy-focussed creative writing course that I am also excited about.  And speaking of voting, I am voting here on Thursday for the Mayor of London, members of the London Assembly, and members of the European Parliament.  I am also hoping to vote in the Canadian federal elections - in fact I am photocopying my passport today in order to fax a form to register for a postal ballot.  Better get to it all...

      This may be my last post ever as I am taking my life in my hands and going with Mark in his 2 seater plane to the Isle of Wight this weekend.  Too bad, since  urlLink Bembridge  looks quite scenic!  We were planning to go to Sandown, also on the island, for Saturday and Sunday but we realised earlier this week that there might be an issue with the D-Day celebrations this weekend.  And there was - we can't fly to that airport.  So the other airfield choice is Bembridge.  But is it a good idea to be flying a small German plan on D-Day?  I think not.  We are probably going to fall into small stretch of Atlantic between the island and mainland UK!  So farewell!  If we do make it there, we are staying at the  urlLink Sea Change B&B  which looks nice.  The town is known for crab and lobster so Mark will be happy.  And the good weather here is continuing so I think we will spend most of the weekend at the beach.  It has been a sloooooooow week at work with most people on holiday so I will be glad to be busy again next week.    Mark is tiling right now - thank god - as the bathroom is nowhere near being finished.  We didn't work on it at all last night as we went to Canadian Comedy Nite at Canada House with Tami's friend from Waterloo Dena and had a great time!  Do you remember a terrible show called  urlLink Ed's Night Party  on City tv?  The co-host of that (e.g. not the damn sock),  urlLink Craig Campbell , was the host last night and he was a RIOT.  Really funny.  And for the second year in a row, I got to see  urlLink Phil Nichol , formerly of Corky and the Juice Pigs, perform the Gay Eskimo song. Alas no Grandma being used as a skateboard this year.  Anyway, we had a lot of fun and there was Moosehead and Inniskillen wine all around.  Better go and make some dinner and do some 'supervising' as my contribution to tiling efforts! ha ha

      Just think of the British slang you can learn from me!   diy  =  the  urlLink 'do it yourself'  addiction that Brits have for home renovation, including 50 million television shows on the subject, and unfortunately the bodge-it jobs that come with it.  'Bodge it' means screw it up.  Badly.     Our house is a pit - there is no toilet and no sink upstairs, but luckily there is another set downstairs.  The old tub is still in, but you can't really use it much as we need to wait for the walls to dry as the plasterer came today to fix them up so we can tile them.  Except Mark is out tonight, we are both out Thursday night at Canadian Comedy Nite at Canada House, and we are supposed to be going to the Isle of Wight on Saturday (Mark flying his plane) if the weather is good.  So this is going to take forever for everything to be done.  I feel bad for the tenants, Liesle and Klaudia really.  I can live with it since I am doing it, but they don't have a choice!  It's half term, which is a school break here, which means that loads of my co-workers are on holiday this week (mostly if they have kids) and for me means I have a nice 'leisurely' week.  Well if no courses are running and no one needs me for anything, it's not my fault if some of my time might be better spent supervising the building site!

       Ooh blogspot has gone all fancy and added loads of extra options for formatting posts!&nbsp; Excellent.    &nbsp;  Mark and I saw Rufus Wainwright play for free at HMV the other night - was lucky enough to notice it in the newspaper in the morning on the way to work.&nbsp; Weirdly there is a CNN story about the gig   urlLink  here   &nbsp;with a pic.&nbsp; Some person has some pics on   urlLink  here   .&nbsp; He played Beauty Mark, Pretty Things, Vibrate, The Art Teacher and Dinner At Eight.&nbsp; We are going to see him at the Barbican in October too.    &nbsp;  I have tickets to see Trauma at the National Film Theatre on August 22nd with Colin Firth and Marc Evans (the director) hosting!&nbsp; Yahoo!    &nbsp;  Last weekend was my birthday.&nbsp; Thank god that's over.&nbsp; And Friday before I found out that even though I didn't think I wanted it or would get it, I've been made manager of my team at work.&nbsp; New title: Development Manager, Community Learning.&nbsp; EEK.&nbsp; We'll see how that goes.    &nbsp;  Still working on the house and the bathroom.&nbsp; In fact I have been grouting tiles and QUITE enjoying myself doing it.&nbsp; No seriously. It's aesthetically pleasing seeing the bathroom look a million times better once you clean the tile adhesive stuff off and fill in the gaps.&nbsp; And Mark put up those flat halogen lights in the kitchen ceiling which looks incredibly better than the old line of flourescent.&nbsp; Ugh.    &nbsp;  My dad will be here in a week with the Scouts, and trying to get some stuff organised for him like randomly picture frames, wood for a display, a cooler, and on line grocery shopping.&nbsp; Don't call my mobile July 30 to August 16 as he will have it, not me!    &nbsp;  Other than that, really looking forward to our holiday mostly just to get away from how busy work has been lately!&nbsp; We get in to Toronto on July 30th at 10:30am ish after a HORRIBLE middle of the night flight.&nbsp; See some of you very soon!

      I am just much too busy at work lately, and now I have to deal with an all-day assessment on Monday and then an interview Tuesday morning for this manager's job that I am not really sure I even want!  However I had a good talk with my acting-down manager today that I should just go with the experience of it, and so if we get someone external hired who is brilliant, everyone will be happy.  I won't have to do more work for the same pay, but will have the experience of a serious interview process.  And the new manager will have to deal with all the BS!  Lots of people are leaving WAES too, people that I like working with, which is a shame.  The place is pretty messed up though.  We are lucky on our team as I think we are shielded from a lot of the bad stuff.  Mark is avoiding the tiling by doing other stuff around the house. Last night it was doing the electrics and installing a light. We got a huge bargain on a dining room light the other day - Â£20 for something that could have cost Â£80+ - and although it's not pefect it's not bad to make the place look a little better, and we don't want to spend a lot of money on stuff like that if we are possibly going to emigrate.  It's sort of like  urlLink C$cip=12150>C$cip=12153&categoryId=12153">this.   Not as nice as Grace and Jay's in Kitchener though!  Too bad the rest of the room is a pit :).  Apparently he is back on the tiling tonight though.  We'll see if we ever have a bathroom up and running again...  Weather has been MISERABLE.  I like the cooler temp, but the wind, lightening and torrential downpour for the past 2 days has been a bit much.  Better go - have to prepare for a presentation for the interview. I don't have time!  And I have to work on Saturday too!  Argh!

      Thank god, after like 2 hours on the phone with technical support today (for a price) I have fixed our internet access at home!  Hurray!  And to celebrate, a little test to see if this works...   Hurray again!!!  We had a great Canada Day this week - and turns out they wrote an article about the London festivities in the Toronto Star!  Not sure how much longer they will have it online, but it's  urlLink here  for now.  I need to remember to tell my mother - the terrible maple leaf tie she got Mark last year was a COMPLETE hit - even the High Commissioner himself commented on it!  Mark got so many people stopping him about it, it was hilarious.  We started at Canada House, had cake and free booze (Moosehead and Niagara wine of course), made our way over to Maiden Lane, where we indulged in root beer, dill pickle chips and hickory sticks, and ended up escaping from the crowd in a Thai restaurant.  Thankfully I spotted Dena somehow among the thousands and we did hang out for a while.  Not much happening this weekend - Mark has been tiling.  Forever tiling.  I wasted like most of the day on the phone fixing the internet.  I have been consumed by the latest series of Big Brother here - it's just compelling. I have never understood the interest before, but this year they have a transexual, several gay men, a guy who grooms for like 1 hour a day in the mirror including shaving all body hair, and so much more.  Otherwise I hung some pictures, tended to my plants and cooked a big dinner.  Tried a Nigella recipe I hadn't made before -   urlLink Za'tar Chicken With Fatoush Salad . God I love her summer cookbook.  I think between Maria and myself we have made just about everything in that book (and thanks to Maria for bequething me her za'tar seasoning when she moved back to the US!).  I have many cookbooks where I have been lucky to make just one of the recipes!  But Nigella is a goddess.  And her whisk is the best tool in my kitchen  We barbequed the chicken, and so I also got a chance to use my new BBQ frying pan from  urlLink Lakeland , perfect for grilling vegetables without having them fall through the rack.  They went well with the couscous I made too.  Summer food rules.   If I don't go now, I am going to get sucked into staying on this thing all night! Good night...

      Just spending some time at work basically before I head off to Canada House for the start of the evening's festivities.  Not sure if we are going to meet up with Dena, but at least Mark is going to meet me.  I am wearing my roots t with CANADA in big letters, and he's got new Canada flag cufflinks I just bought him (was going to wait to give as a gift in December, but realised they would be useful today!) and he's also brought this terrible tie my mother bought him but maybe he won't put it on!  I think first there is some singing and stuff at Canada House, then cake (excellent, always looking for an excuse to eat cake) and then supergarage are performing. There are the normal festivities in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden where the Maple Leaf Pub is, but I also understand there is a pub near Victoria (near my work) owned by a Canadian that is serving kraft dinner and more tonight.  Actually that would be exciting except we had that for dinner on Monday as Em brought me some back from Canada with her, and they came down from Wales to London last weekend.  Mmm it was good.  Just spent some time before lunch doing a math practice test of all things.  There is a push at work to make sure that staff are okay on the numeracy bit as we are trying to do a lot of basic skills teaching (such as literacy but maths too).  I signed up to take a proper test on Monday at level 2 which is quite basic, and I just struggled with all kinds of things doing it!  No recollection whatsoever how to do ratios or volume!  Luckily about 34 of the 40 questions were pretty straightforward.  I don't want to look like a dork when I fail this thing.  Although I suppose it won't affect my job!  And hey we get lunch and wine after taking it, so what the heck.

       Odd to be posting in Canada as these messages seem to usually be about reminiscing about the homeland!!  We are having a good holiday here so far.  I have to admit that I wasn't as excited to be coming home as I was at Christmas; this time it feels like we were just here, and I just saw everyone like the other day or something.  I think I've only had one or two double doubles as well - last time was all about the food I was missing!  So far, we've spent time with my mum, went down to Kitchener to see Grace and Kristen which was great, I got a bad sunburn at Guelph Lake, we got soaked on the Maid of the Mist when we did the super tourist visit to Niagara Falls, we saw Jen and Bill in Toronto who I hadn't seen in 2 years, and now we have had the pleasure of meeting Samantha's baby son Tate who is super cute and smiley.  In fact you can see for   urlLink  yourselves   .      This morning I found out that I have one OSAP payment left and I am done!  YAHOO!!  I fast tracked it in the past few months and have been putting about $1000 a month towards it.  Now I can just save that money, maybe towards a move over here...      Mark is all obsessed with what kind of house he's going to buy over here again.  We were out for a walk the other night and took a look at a 4000 sq. foot model near my parent's, and it was the most mental thing I have ever seen.  No one needs bedrooms that big!  Anyway, I don't want it, and I am not going to live in Oshawa or anywhere east of Toronto, but it was nice to see what a lot less pounds than dollars can buy.      And in an hour - I must go and shower really - we are driving up to Tami's cottage east of North Bay to hang out with her and Matti till Monday.  On Monday we see Jean and Michelle in North Bay and meet their baby girl Isabelle, and then drive to my grandparent's in Ottawa.  Only one more week's vacation to go, which sucks, but August will be quiet when I get back to work.  The calm before the storm - when everyone gets back in September is when I have to start the scary management job!      Probably will check in again when back on British soil.
