      What are your dreams?  I have a ton of them.  I don't mean the literal ones that you have when you go to bed.  I mean the ones you have about your future.  (But I would rather call them goals or hopes, because that way, it seems reachable.  :)  Here are some of mine:  I hope of having two kids (halfway there), 1 boy and 1 girl.  I hope of giving them a better life than my parents gave me (and that's a tall order!) by being able to give them the best possible education, and provide them with the best material and emotional support.    I hope of still being happily married with Stan, going out on dates regularly, enjoying ourselves, even after 20+ years of marriage.  I hope of Stan and I owning a successful business one day that keeps us busy and financially secure.  I hope of employing a lot of people who can help us run the business which gives us time to enjoy life with each other and the kids.  I hope of having the money to buy a house in a subdivision without draining my bank account or having to take out a loan.  I hope of one day being able to travel once a year without worrying about the expense.    I hope of being able to provide my children with homes when the time comes for them to take the plunge into married life. I hope that Stan and I will be able to bring our children up in such a way that they grow up to become successful, independent, responsible, hard working and kind people.  I hope that Stan and I will have a loooong and happy life together (hopefully, see our grandkids grow up).  Ah.. it's nice to hope about the future. :)  Here's to hoping all of this will come true. :)

        Caitlyn's Baptism and Birthday    Caitlyn had her baptism last weekend (finally).  We also celebrated her first birthday early with a simple dinner with friends and family.  It was a good day. :)  Caitlyn really enjoyed herself, she was playing and socializing with my cousins and guests until 11:30 PM.  It was nice to see her socialize because she has a tendency to be shy like me. :)   * * * * * * * *     Doctor's Check Up    I took Caitlyn to her doctor for her regular check up this morning and was relieved to find out she has finally gained the weight.  She was a bit underweight for almost 2 months since she is so active and she doesn't eat that much.  Knowing her weight is finally proportionate to her height is such a relief.  She's on the upper 25 percentile for both height and weight now.  Whew!  She also had her shot for Hepa A today.  And she didn't cry again.  She hasn't cried during her last three shots which really surprised the doctor.  ;)  This is great because at least she hasn't got a phobia of doctors.. yet.    I was given a tip by a friend that to make sure your kids don't develop a fear of doctors, you have to make sure your baby is calmed before leaving the doctor's office.  Don't leave the office while the baby is still hysterical.  A tip for all mothers (or soon to be mothers) everywhere.

       Elusive sleep   I'm feeling a bit blue today.  I haven't been sleeping very well.  Very restless nights.  I don't know why.  I'm starting to miss having a full 8 hours sleep... for over a week now, I've only been averaging about 5 hours of sleep.  Definitely not enough.   It's starting to catch up to me.  I'm starting to feel tired all the time.  Oh well, tonight is another night. :)   * * * * * * * *   Zatoichi and the Asian Film Genre   We recently found a DVD copy of Zatoichi, a Japanese movie my brother highly recommended, in Greenhills. (That place sells everything!)  It was very very good!  Highly entertaining albeit violent.  It has a lot of comic moments.  A must watch but not for the queasy.   S  and I love watching Asian films.  We bought 4 new asian films from the same greenhills store and we're looking forward to watching it.  If you're considering watching Asian Films, here are some to consider:  1)  Romantic Comedy: My Sassy Girl (Korean) 2)  Comedy: Shaolin Soccer (Chinese) 3)  Action: Once upon a time in China 1 to 3 (Chinese) 4)  Action: Zatoichi and Battle Royale (Japanese)  There are a lot more of note but I can't remember the titles as of now. :) hehe  Also, thanks to my cousin  T  we recently enjoyed a marathon   of Vision of Escaflowne.  I love that anime.  We are looking for other animes to enjoy. :)  My brother is giving us a list.   * * * * * * * *    Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban   We caught the movie a few weeks ago.  It was entertaining though nowhere half as rich as the book itself.  It was necessary for the screenwriter to cut a lot of scenes from the book to make the movie short and watchable.  Altogether, a good effort.  I think this director is a whole lot better than Chris Columbus.  Even the actors have evolved, their acting was much better than the first two movies.    Definitely a must watch for all harry potter fans like me.   * * * * * * * *

      I love weekends. Fridays are mostly wasted on me because I'm already on weekend mode, counting the minutes until S comes home.  That's when weekends officially begin.  I don't care what we're doing.  It doesn't have to be anything at all.  I just like being around S for two whole days... before he goes back to work again on monday.  I think that's the good thing about working apart, there's always something to be excited about when we see each other again at the end of the day.

      A dear friend of mine recently lost a mother.    I was there in the hospital the first night of her ordeal and when she started crying on my shoulders, it broke my heart.  I wanted to take her pain away.  But I knew I couldn't.  All I could do was comfort her as best I could.    A few days ago, I attended the wake and there was an obvious peace on my friend's face.  There was acceptance.  She told me that she has learned to accept it because of her affiliation with a religious group.  Their teachings helped her find peace even in her grief and loss.   I can't help but admire the way my friend handled this difficult time of her life.  She faced it with a courage and strength I don't think I could ever muster.  I don't think I have half her strength (in fact, if I had half her strength I would be proud of myself).  She displayed grace under the most extreme pressure.    I have always admired this friend of mine.  Now, I admire her even more.  To my dear friend, my prayers are with you and your family.

      Caitlyn is 11 months old.  She is now a walking (and sometimes running if you're holding one hand) wonder.  When I leave for the office, she cries bloody murder.  It's so cute.  She has also learned to kiss, eskimo kiss and hug on demand.  She can make beautiful eyes.  She loves to "read" (meaning take out all her books and turn the pages and let me read to her).  When we sing or we play music, she swings her arms like she's conducting.  She also waves bye-bye.  She is already semi-potty trained (only for #2) except if we don't understand what she wants then accidents happen.   Her development is amazing.  She hasn't said her first official words (except for the occassional surprises when she's babbling) but we're waiting with bated breath.  She does communicate to us in her own little way. She was never a baby that cries a lot.  She was never colic.  Even when she was young, she only cries if she's hungry or uncomfortable.  Now, she only cries if something hurts.  She doesn't even cry when she's hungry, she just babbles nonstop and starts sucking her thumb or points to her bottle to let us know she's hungry.     Recently, she has also learned to manipulate grown ups movements by pretending to cry!  Yes... she is starting to PRETEND to cry.  Drama, so to speak.  And it works especially well on the grandparents!  She just scrunches up her face and whines and wails.  At home, we ignore her when she's pretending so after a while, she shuts up after a few minutes because she knows she won't get her way.  We don't want her to get spoiled.  As difficult as it is to let her keep on whining, we put up with it just to let her know she can't always have her way. For such a small person she can sure throw her weight around.    What's even more wonderful about having a baby is you start seeing the world through their eyes... like everything's new.  Everything is amazing and exciting to babies.  And everything, even the most mundane of things, becomes amazing because of them.

      My husband is so adorable.  I know I'm making a lot of people sick but it's true!  He's just so adorable.    He is very busy with his new job and everything but he always manages to make time to be with me.  Sometimes, we are able to go out and catch the last full show of a good movie (there are a lot of those lately).  Sometimes, we even go out and play badminton (starting 9 when caitlyn is asleep).  Yes, we even go out on weekdays.  I love it that he consciously makes an effort to just spend time with me, doing things I enjoy.    I love that he still calls me from the office whenever something happens to him, ranging from the silly to the serious.  I love that he still ends every phone conversation with "I love you".  I love that I can still get a reaction from him when I wear something nice.   I love that occassionally he still brings me little presents. I love that he usually asks me if I have money so that he can give me some if I don't have any (yes.. i am a moocher!).  I love that when I wake up coughing, he still gets up and looks for medicine for me without me asking for any help.  What I love the most is that he consciously makes me a big part of his life and he's not afraid to tell people about it.  He brings me to his outings and nights out so that his co-workers and friends can get to know me.    After 9 years (7 years together, 2 years married), even if we see each other at our absolute worst (with morning breath, cranky evenings, farts and all), he still manages to make life absolutely wonderful...  Life becomes wonderful because of the little things. :)

      I went back to the office today.    No, I haven't finished deciding whether or not brokerage is the thing for me but my clients have started chasing me down.  Obviously, I couldn't just ignore them so I'm back in the office again for now. :)  I still plan to take off one of these days, maybe spend the day with my pregnant girlfriend.

      I spent day 3 of my lazy days talking to Jo all morning.  Being pregnant and prescribed bedrest, she too had a lot of time on her hands... much to my luck.  We had a very good talk covering pregnancy, babies, mother-in-laws, and VANITY.  Ever since I gave birth, I have been more vain than I have ever been in my entire life.  Last night I got the thrill of my life just because someone told me I looked like a teenager who has I have never given birth.  She could have very well been exaggerating but it gave me a thrill nonetheless.    I was never a vain person.  Suddenly I'm worried about the extra weight and looking old.  So I sit here and wonder, why does how I look suddenly become so important to me?  I think it's because I still want to feel attractive and be attractive, especially to my hubby.  I still want to be able to wear a swimsuit without shame (not quite there yet).    I think I'm going through some sort of post-partum crisis.  I am already a mother but I don't want to lose who I was prior to becoming one.  Going back to work is easy... fitting back into the pre-pregnancy look, not so much.    The most important thing I am wondering about is:  is this normal?  I hope it is. :)  In the meantime, here I am, exercising 5 x a week (i could NEVER diet), hoping to lose the last 5 to 7 pounds (of 37 woohoo!) but given up on losing the paunch, wondering when I'll snap out of it.

      My second blog today.  Call it what you wish...  i call it laziness.  I've been so frustrated with being a real estate broker these past few weeks I've been seriously contemplating giving it up completely.  Seriously.    So I decided to lay off it for a while.  I'm sure I'll miss having something to do.  If I don't, then it's a sign that I should look for something else to do to earn a little extra cash.  God knows I need the money. Don't we all?    I figure it'll also give me time to think about what I want to do with my life.    It also gives me time to plan Caitlyn's first birthday which is coming up soon.

      My cousin Khris and brother Deck started blogs ages ago.  I was never really into the internet scene because staring at a monitor too long gives me headaches.  Yet... here I am.  I figured this is a good way to replace the trusty old diary and clear my mind of my thoughts.     Being a new mother and 2 year old wife, I find I have little time for myself.  Any decisions to be made have to be made with other people in mind... my adorable new baby or my loveable husband, Stan.  I said goodbye to the ME-ME-ME stage of my life when I said "I DO" over 2 years ago.  Not that I'm complaining.  I think I made a wonderful trade.  I'd recommend married life to anyone.  I've been having a blast.   Being one of two isn't bad...

       A Wife's Worries   Stan has been getting really bad migraines lately.&nbsp; So bad that He has never had them before.&nbsp; We think it's about the stress but I'm worried it might be about his high blood pressure or something.&nbsp; The only meals we have together are dinners.&nbsp; And I am torn between arranging for a meal that he loves to eat but are very fattening and high in cholesterol and fat or a meal that is a bit healthier (usually baked or grilled meats or veggies) but he doesn't enjoy.&nbsp; He simply doesn't enjoy the healthier foods.&nbsp; He is so happy if the meal is fried chicken or anything fried for that matter.&nbsp;   So here I am... torn... is it more important for my hubby to be happy with his meals or stay healthy?  Doctors have advised him to cut back on the fats because he has a fatty liver.&nbsp; He also has a history of diabetes that really worries me because he LOVES sweets.&nbsp; He can't get enough of them.  I'm worried that I'm not taking care of him enough.&nbsp;   And that's just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; I have a&nbsp;ton of worries with being a wife and a mom... but that's for a different blog.

       *Yawn*    &nbsp; I'm still sleepy.&nbsp;   Stan went home really early yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; He was home at about 3:00 pm.&nbsp; So he fetched Caitlyn and I at around 4 PM and I escorted him when he went to pick up something from a L'Oreal client.&nbsp; We ended up watching an early movie of I,Robot.&nbsp; Pretty good movie.&nbsp; Great graphics.   * * * * * * * * * *

       Appreciation   I read an article on Kerygma (a very good&nbsp;Catholic Magazine) about enjoying your relationships.&nbsp; If you don't enjoy your relationships, your life on earth can be a hell, for both of you.&nbsp;   It has an assignment for everyone in a significant relationship in your life.&nbsp; Write 10 things you appreciate or love about your significant other.&nbsp; The challenge is not just to do it once but to do it all the time.&nbsp; ALL the time.&nbsp; Make it a constant in your life together.&nbsp; This helps you not take your relationships for granted.&nbsp; It's surprising how people can only remember the bad times in your life and forget all the good things that your significant other has done.&nbsp; Since nobody's perfect, there are bound to be some mistakes made along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weakness of humans is their tendency to only remember the bad.&nbsp; This exercise forces you to remember the good.&nbsp;   I think this is a wonderful idea.&nbsp; It also ensures that you won't take each other for granted.  I challenge all of you out there in a major relationship, especially the married ones to start making your lists. :)&nbsp; And make them often.   Since I only recently made a blog about the wonders of Stan, just refer to that in the meantime for my list. :)&nbsp;

       Coffee Induced State of Consciousness   I didn't sleep at all last night.&nbsp; Stan woke up to go to the bathroom at 5 AM and I was STILL awake!!!&nbsp; Let's just say I wasn't feeling well.&nbsp; I fell asleep at around 6:30 AM (i think) and&nbsp;I dragged myself out of bed at 9:30 in the morning.&nbsp; Dragged being the operative word.&nbsp;   At 10, I was at Glorietta (deck and I are browsing around the stores trying to get import ideas) and I drank a cup of coffee just to stay awake.&nbsp; I feel like a zombie right now.&nbsp; My body is awake but my mind...&nbsp;not all there.&nbsp; My mom is trying to talk me into taking a nap but I don't think it's a good idea.&nbsp; Might not be able to fall asleep tonight because I'm not used to naps and I don't think I can stand another night of tossing and turning.  &nbsp;

       Fortune Telling and Prayers    &nbsp; You won't believe what I did a few days ago.&nbsp; I went to this Chinese-Catholic Temple/Church.&nbsp; I said it right!&nbsp; It's a church worshipping God and Jesus with the crucifix and everything.&nbsp; But it also has incense and the fortune telling thing the buddhists believe in.&nbsp; My mom goes there all the time and for the past 10 years, the "sticks" have been surprisingly and shockingly accurate.&nbsp; It's a bit scary.  Here's the process.&nbsp; You start by lighting incense and praying to the Lord, telling Him you really need His guidance in your life.&nbsp; After you finish your heartfelt prayer, you put the incense sticks on the pot and then approach the altar.&nbsp; On the altar, there are two crescent shaped objects that are rounded on one side and flat on the other.&nbsp; You ask the Lord if&nbsp;He wants to answer your question then toss the objects lightly into the air.&nbsp; If it lands like this:&nbsp; one round side up, one flat side up; then YES he'll answer the question.&nbsp; If not,&nbsp;NO go.&nbsp; The Lord feels you're not sincere or something and you should ask again... keep praying and keep tossing the things until you get a yes.  When you get a yes.&nbsp; You grab a vase shaped thing with about a hundred sticks inside.&nbsp; Keep shaking the vase until one of the sticks pop out.&nbsp; Once it pops out, take note of the number of the stick.&nbsp; Pick up the two crescent shaped things again and ask the Lord if the answer to your question is the number of the stick that popped out.&nbsp; Again, if one round side is up and one flat side is up, the answer is yes.&nbsp; Otherwise, put stick back into vase and keep shaking.&nbsp; Repeat until you get the right stick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you get the right numbered stick, go to a small drawer with sheets of paper inside and retrieve the paper that corresponds to your stick number.&nbsp; That's the answer to your question. The only downside is answers are in chinese so you need to get someone to translate it.  It's a weird yet surprisingly satisfying way to communicate with the Lord.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom has been going there for ages.&nbsp; Don't think that the fortunes they give are all good.&nbsp; Half of the time they tell you what you're doing is all wrong.&nbsp; And it's not just a yes or no answer either.&nbsp; The answers are really long and surprisingly detailed.&nbsp; The answers are also pretty accurate, especially with my mom and her friends.   It's just a very interesting place&nbsp;and way to worship.&nbsp; And it's nice to have a feeling that somehow, something is being answered.&nbsp; Even if you don't like the answer.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

       I'm Back! &nbsp;   Stan and I are really hooked on Amazing Race now.&nbsp; It's our must watch show every week.&nbsp; Personally, I'm rooting for the height-challenged girl (forgot her name) because I admire her courage and strength.&nbsp; Her teammate isn't that likeable though.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   &nbsp;  We just finished the series 24 season 3 lately.&nbsp; It's a really good series to watch but not something you should watch if you don't have much time.&nbsp; It's the type of series you can't stop watching.&nbsp; They managed to keep it interesting and I wasn't expecting them to be able to maintain the level of excitement of the first 2 seasons.&nbsp;

        Mean Girls         A comedy about popular girls in school ruling the entire batch.  It's supposed to be very good.  What's shocking is, it's true.  My cousin from the US is 14. She goes to a private school and her entire batch is composed of 35... yes, only 35 students.  That's her entire batch!  I would assume with such a small class, they would be a close knit group.   WRONG!  When I asked her about Mean Girls, she said she doesn't want to watch the movie because she's living it everyday.  There are 3 popular girls in her batch that rule the school.  She says they literally rule the school.  To be popular, you need to be blond, sexy and beautiful.  Then, there are the OK girls (just 2 of them), then there are the geeks (everyone else).  That's just for the girls.  The guys are less judgmental but there are still geeks.  She told me you wouldn't want to be labeled a geek.  That'd make your life hell.  Being associated with a geek would also make you a geek.  In just a class of 35, discrimination and cliques abound.  I can only imagine how much worse it can be in a public school.  I feel bad for my cousin. She's beautiful and very smart (she won the George Bush award for student excellence last year).   Despite that, she is very insecure.  She's only 14 so she's still trying to find her identity and her place in the world.  For a teenager, she's pretty together.  But her insecurities are immense.  Peer pressure is very hard to live with especially with sex.  She told me that in the US public schools, kids as young as 11 are deemed losers if they haven't had or performed oral sex.  YES!  That shocked me too!  Her school is better because they're more protected but the pressure is still great.  In addition, she says it's hard to be an Asian in a place where Asians are generally looked down on.  And to think she lives in California, a place where Asians are especially plentiful.  Racism still abounds in the US no matter how civilized and progressive the country seems to be.  Bullying can be really bad and she feels blessed that she has managed to stay under the radar.   Being a teenager is hard.  I remember my growing up years were also fraught with insecurity.  And I'm already lucky I didn't have to deal with the pressure of sex or racism.

       DOLLARS!!!!   I'm on a dollar buying spree!  It's so hard to purchase dollars now.  I can't believe it.  They have a cap and everything.  And the rate changes everyday so it's so hard to anticipate when to buy and how much to buy it at.  I've been calling all my contacts in banks, trying to get the best rates.  I need to buy it now so that I can slowly stock up on them to prepare for our trip to Canada next year for my citizenship and Stan's and Caitlyn's landing.  We'll be staying there for about a month and take a side trip to the US so i need the greenbacks. :)  In case you know anyone who is trying to unload dollars... please... give me a call.

       SHOPPING!!!   I LOVE buying clothes.  I used to hate it when I was a kid until my teens (maybe because I was so fat and nothing fit me).  Now, I enjoy it so much.  It's not the act of buying itself as the trying on of clothes and finding a great look.  It's one of my favorite things to do.  I never shop in malls though.  My favorite shopping place is still Greenhills.  Always has, always will be.  I love finding great bargains.  I find the stuff in the malls a bit too pricey.  And you can always find the same styles in Greenhills as in the malls although sizes are a bit smaller.  Luckily, I'm so small so the clothes are usually perfect for me.   ... on to more important things.

       You make me want to be a better man...      ...  or something like that, as the line goes in the movie As Good As It Gets. I believe that is how you can tell if the relationship is generally a good one.  Relationships with boyfriends/husbands take on many different forms. Every relationship is different and every relationship will go through ups and downs.  But I believe that the sign that you are in a GOOD and healthy relationship is if, because of it, you have become a  better version of yourself .  Your relationship should enhance your good qualities... or maybe pick up some good qualities of your "significant other".  * * * * * * * * * *  Why am I writing this? I just know someone who recently got involved and I'm worried about her. She's not the same person. She's become a bit stand-offish when she used to be warm. She used to actively participate in conversations and is bubbly and a bit loud and funny. Now, she's acting demure and quiet and a bit full of herself when she's around him and it freaks me out. She's changed... and it's not for the better.  I have been forbidden to talk to her about it since the relationship is turning serious so I'm writing everything I want to say here. I'm just venting...  Don't worry  T ...i'm not talking about you. :)

       Weekend at Highlands   Our relatives from the US arrived last Thursday so we took them to Tagaytay Highlands this weekend.  It was so much fun.  All our mother side relatives based here in Manila went on the trip too.  We played badminton (of course) and swam.  That evening, we took over the entire basketball court of the country club.  Half were playing basketball, the other half badminton.  It was great seeing all the relatives having fun playing sports under one roof even if it was only for two days.  I had so much fun.  I really wish we could do this more often.
