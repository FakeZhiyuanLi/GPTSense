      Sitting in solitude, thoughts in plentitude Pondered,over the day, she had a role to play That crossed another's way,many in the fray Sailed beyond,she may,they too had a say The line was very fine,started with a dine Invisible though it may seem, they could feel It was an illusion, she explained, Her words, they failed to entertain She brooded over the language, Passed to her down the ages To communicate the right feeling, She dug deep and went down reeling Blinded by the raging conflict, She was afraid she would still inflict More wounds to bring down a friendship All I could do was sit and listen Trying to understand the compassion And smile straight at a solution

      We wish to see in reality, things in plenty But lose count of the perennial flow, after twenty Day and nights race by swift Still the counts come by drift Somewhere down they become dormant or die Only to stand up to remind our prayers are a lie Still we hold strong and resolve To see them happen and not dissolve Human beings are born to pray and wait Still end up becoming just a bait Sacrifice is supreme, cried the master We console the death of the counts, that seem faster At the back of my mind, it rings loud That I am trying to reach the cloud Still I resolve, to pray with hope and desire As I believe God will never conspire After all, we all have the right to dream As we all unconsciously flow down the stream.

      Our arrivals were miles apart And destinations, a big question mark But now, together we travel And so many things together we unravel You, as a person I know a lot Well enough to read your mind and thoughts But still puzzled about your personality As it stretches me beyond certain rationality Sometimes soft and emotional as a child Yet many a time, bold decisions coming from your mind I see a true and trusty human being, unmasked and not far In you Dear and I like you for all that you are. Frankly from my heart I admit You are someone special to me, my friend.

      Tides are always high We all face them with a sigh Still make an effort wide To feel the success lap our side Champion, is the one who fights However dark be the nights Difficulties everyone will feel But experience is only around your heel I admire your brave stride Against every upcoming tide My heart skips a beat, goes blank 'Cos I see you without even a plank Also wrestling with a dangerous shark My tears are not seen as it is already dark My dear friend, I pray for you For courage and vision too Don't give up, the world is with you. And as a neighbor I am too.

      In solitude stood a rooted trunk In highest majesty spearding leaved branches Into an appreciable diameter Its pride was clouded with a strange helpless feeling of loneliness Travelers passed by looked with raised brows Awestruck they were dragged to spend A few hours in its relaxing cool shade Every visitor would make sure to remark He wished if this could be shiftedto his home Nomads too joined the list They all got substitutes None thought about making a house beneath And make "his majesty" owned. It was killing The dried trunk was saved and twigs were also taken home They made good firewood and furniture Everyone used it alive and wanted it dead What remained with it always was - Solitude

      O' Lady! Reveal not your bosom  And prove, you are beautiful to some Let it talk for itself I will judge myself. A flower naturally says its fragrance And nothing causes it a hindrance Let me not see bright red marks  On your forehead, like hungry sharks To prove your matrimony And disrupt my harmony Let your eyes speak that language And give me the freedom to gauge Have I caged you, with your freedom? And makes you writhe in boredom From your mind, speak out But carefully murmur not By time I am getting older Does that make you bolder? Allow me to feel Still I repeat, do not reveal.

      Gazing through the sparkling glass window The little boy's eyes burrowed He had to be dragged and hopped His eyes were filled with eagerness And his heart with desire They swelled with each passing minute Till finally he got one toy defenite The longer the wait, the more the emotion  So thought the creator Who never went against nature He too made mistakes grave That showed due to a man who was brave For he never knew That they died a natural death too With no desire and eagerness in store He still laughed and made merry And never ever felt sorry Still it was in him mild, he wanted a child Is the creator still churning? Or is the fire in him still burning?

      He knocked twice No response He turned to leave A wind blew and the door opened a little He peeped inside Sound of water gushing He stepped in Silently sat with a magazine Good cover photo  The gushing stopped Irresistible He got up and peeped in though the gap She was drying her hair A short towel around her He felt his blood gushing He resumed his seat  He is seated behind her  In the classroom He could smell the shampoo His blood gushed He teased her She smiled back He had liked her He could not muster enough courage To tell her “I love you”  He met a friend And got her address His wait ended when  He got out of the cab At her house And knocked her door Great expectations He forget his family Temporarily  She came out Saw him and stood stunned Forgot that she was still in a towel Moved slowly towards him He stood up Gaping at her “How are you?” “Fine” “And you” Yeah. Fine”  He stretched his hands She dropped into them They remained locked The room was filled with The pungent aroma of Sweat and the same Shampoo His and hers They walked into the inner room  He came out All over His expectations fulfilled He kissed her one last time And bid goodbye She stood there Smiling at him She did not feel any difference It was just another customer But with a difference She did not charge him Because she thought  She owed him He never knew  Her normal day resumed His new day dawned Both their own ways Back to their life Long journey For a moment of ecstasy  And normalcy  That is life. We see only our paths Not other’s It goes on and on and on……

      Compelled to retreat his path by a well wisher he traced the long forgotten starange way and recognised many familiar objects When flashes crossed his film most strangers became just crossed familiars he dug deep into his storage cells to strike similarities his retreat turned too novel and truth seemed yonder came along one introduction that seemed known till recently but took a unknown turn to a scarry path he feared his long healed wounds had opened he did not bleed becasue he did not have blood or life a strange look fixed on his face his wellwisher saw  not his friend but his ghost the ghost still lives happily and with love

      I believed I was full For so many years. This “fullness” was accompanied by others Independence and self sufficiency I survived all along – starving. You poured and filled the rest Into a space filled with vacuum Which I never knew existed. I looked back and noticed the drains Which you carefully plugged. As you never tagged any, I contend shamefully I never had a reason to say I never noticed. I take a long silent pride in admitting in whispers Which I believe will reach only your ears That I always subconsciously Leaned on your strong shoulders. Now sitting in a corner Of this lonely strange planet With a few inert objects as companions I think aloud to myself Because perfect communication Is a visible obstacle here. You graduate to become my best half. I pray you hear this too My dear.

      Like a dried trunk, vast in diameter he stood Full of life, a guardian with a majestic hood Strength, was his strength, they all under stood Moral values and material, he gave them ample food His sharp eyes spoke of one thing, always Righteousness and perfection in every phase They played with glee but well mannered on this firm base  He made sure they never slipped and fell on their face Nothing can cause me a bother. As I am proud to call him my father.  Leaves of green and purple, all in color The best they have seen and felt in demeanor  No compromise whatsoever in grandeur  Can feel the radiance of love in every manner Cool shade ensured with ample breeze around  When it comes to our share it is always more by a pound The call from the heart is never less in sound And leaves a passerby standing and gaping astound Nothing can cause me a bother As I am proud to call her my mother.  A perfect companion since arrival Always teaching the threads of survival With a list of things to be rushed for a burial Strong beside to feel the sand and gravel An eagles eye against possible danger Lacking, in appearance, the tough look of a ranger Full of melody and softness, seen in a singer Taught, never give up with out being a winner Nothing can cause me a bother. As I am proud to call him my brother.  Dedication and confidence shining in the eyes Never knew the term, normally called lies In life, proved a graduate more than twice An association resulting in the term wise Changing the word adamant to sound positive and good Unchallenged in the decision and path, always stood Unflinching and straight in every mood Taught everyone how important it is not to brood Nothing can cause me a bother As I am proud to call her my wife.  For the show, already begun, a late entrant A mind that seemed always transparent Seeing a step ahead was a basic requirement Measuring well with the best temperament Life is never a knot, a complicated ball Always to ensure, they do not fall In calculation though slightly small A fire wall to protect them all Nothing can cause me a bother As by law I am proud to call her my sister.  The angel arrived, long awaited. Cute, cuddly and tender. I call him - my life.

      I switched off the fan Not because The air with in the four walls was chill or The sound was snatching away traces of my sleep or To save the mounting electricity bills or Due to the fear that the hook holding the fan might snap and bring down the fan on my knees But because I felt the fan was tired of running  Between this and that Views differ, yet both seem so real. Everyone is right when you see through their eyes.

      Arrest him! The voice loud Failed, he, to make his parents proud Lock him in – the order trailed Clenched fists, he looked frail.  Snatched a chain, for a wile Abuses were heaped in pile Careless of his fathers name Closed his eyes in shame  Punched and beaten on his face Darkness alone, a saving grace Pounded to reveal his identity Silent and mute, his head hung in gravity  All the townsfolk were summoned Identify, your son who sinned Everyone hurried to the cell Anticipation in the air was felt  An elderly single father in the crowd Walked earnestly without a frown Prepared to face the worst He knew it would be his son dearest  Rehearsed several times in his mind Reaction to the truth when he finds Prayed for miracle and courage All alone caught in a barrage  The moment arrived - reality stared Trust, faith and belief lay bared In the darkness for his son he searched To HIM, his prayers never reached  No one can prepare for a reality It comes in all its brutality Escape is non-existent Rest is consistent.

      Blessed  Shattered and scattered, in ruins not The spirit was always hot Communication ignored and lost The binding was sound and fast  He traveled from far and long Merged as one, like a song Thrilled to see a familiar face Instantly caught in a wild embrace  A kiss of happiness on each cheek Something he will always seek Tears welled in his heart Which always tore him apart  Crouched and crumpled in his large and lonely home He lay counting on the days to come For an instant he closed his eyes All his loved ones rolled like a dice  With deep anguish he missed them all Their strong hands could hold him from a fall He thanked god for the care and blessings He loved the best human beings during the passing  For his worries he saw they shed tears That erased all his worst fears Even time cannot move us apart I love you all from my heart

      He ran around a circle, imaginary Thoughts pushing him beyond the ordinary Concentrating on a problem, so seemed Till time gave a solution, much in need Stopped then, he all of a sudden Chance to put down his burden Were his efforts a waste, he later thought Could these solutions be bought  All around him everyone raced Each of them getting outpaced Their destinations do they all reach Or end up as a topic to preach The solutions seem dramatic When not looked pragmatic Once achieved they look inane As simple as a window pane  His thought was his problem He carried on as his emblem They said thoughts are god given Every man will one day be forgiven Then this running, a question mark Reality stared at him stark Look back for a while, with feign God is once again playing his game.  Who wins?

      A lasting impression, deep within She creates, with out a whim A smile stitched on her face Full of life and overflowing grace  Compelled to compare with a kite Flying high on a full moon night Gliding and swaying all her way In her territory having a total say  The softness seen externally Wraps the toughness permanently As the night closes tight She is still seen everywhere in sight  Undiminished vigor and always active I term this boss “very effective” Circumstances give birth to friends few I am glad to see a friend in you.

      In a stroke, numbers change Creatures from deep slumbers wake Of endless activity, boredom and strife To an expectation filled life Another routine phenomenon Consciously blown out of proportion  Resolutions galore everywhere Trying to tie down things gone hay ware Success is never measured But resolutions are always treasured To be repeated the subsequent year Still failures never bringing a tear  Health and hygiene to fitness Resolve to also increase the smartness Education, careers and family All fizzle out in time tamely Have you thought about your society? One that has helped you in your anxieties  Go out and help others around And you too will be crowned  Strangers, colleagues and friends All wanting you for some errands Extend to them your hands and a smile You will build towers of happiness, tile by tile  Have kindness and compassion in your eyes And a spirit to accommodate and be nice Resolve to help everyone around you I am sure the world will be a better place for you.

      Do you know,  you are being used as a plank of the staircase for people to go up. They depend on you very much  when they are below you. Once they step on you and go up you are forgotten.  But you feel you too have gone higher, to help them even more. Once again they use you,to climb.  Do not feel dejected for being used and  do not break down, for they will need you to climb down too.  Help. That's why you are there.
