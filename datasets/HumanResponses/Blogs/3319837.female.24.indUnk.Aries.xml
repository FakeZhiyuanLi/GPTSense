      Thursday, went to Niagara last night. LaPlaca showed up under the table and had a Heineken and a Jameson on the rocks. This morning... he did not remember ordering those drinks. Also had apparently opened the cab door and hit himself in the eye. Classic.  I went home fairly early 12:30am, but i'm tired still. woke up at 4:15 for some reason. talked to a friend online for a few. He thought that i was nuts b/c i was awake.  this blog sucks.

      bored or maybe tired... I need a television I think, but what's a television without a sofa? ARGH. I got an AC before a sofa. I wish I had real internet instead of wireless only in my hall where I have to sit on the floor. I think my friend is going to hook me up with a discount on printing an oversized poster pf a photo I took. I really need something up on the walls here. It's sad.

      So Friday after work I go to meet up with Jason at Starbucks in Union Square We get tea and he wants to sit in the park. He says that 'we need to talk' Uh-oh! We need to talk is never a good thing, so he proceeds to tell me how I'm this great girl and that he loves hanging out with me, and even though i totally don't pressure him to hang out with me and I'm good about letting him have his space, he still feels kind of trapped...uhhhh wtf? He says he doesn't want a relationship, that it's him and not me, and he wished he could, etc... blah blah. So really when it comes down to it, i guess he just wants to slut around, even though he claims that's not really the reason. And after our "talk" over a week ago, he wasn't down for the part where I said if he were going to date anyone else, then go do it, but then let me know because then I didn't want to be involved with him... and so he wants to still hang out, just not under the 'dating' title or something like that. Oh well then. He was surprised that I took it really well. I wasn't going to sit there and say no no no you can't do this. what kind of self-respecting girl should do that. Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly disappointed and I was surprised as hell, but at what would be the point in crying over it. we were only dating, it was only 2 months, and I kind of got the wrong idea, but honestly, i know that i'm okay with it, this shit happens. but that's the story.

      Barbeque was fun. People got drunk and silly. I came home and played with my new piece of furniture. Nerdy? Yes, but I don't care so fuck off! It looks pretty fuckin cool if you ask me. Can't wait til I have a TV to put on the damn thing (cross your fingers that it fits on top). Supposed to hang out with Jason tomorrow. Haven't seen the guy in a week. Talked to him tonight, but he was feeling poopy. I'd like to put some art work in my hallway, too bad i don't have a hammer to put nails up in there, then again, I don't think I have enough shit to put up, so it might look weird with only a few pieces up. Plus, i'm still sitting in my hallway aka office on the floor that is.   Got groped by some little shit 13 year old today on 8th and 41st. Those little fuckers were soooo lucky they started running after I reamed on them and started walking towards them, otherwise I would have crushed their little balls and shoved em down their mouths and/or broken their legs and hands as well. Kids today, what the fuck is wrong with them. There are not enough ass kicking is what it is. Some of them deserve a fucking belt to the ass. in any case, back to cleaning my apt.

      I cancelled my sofa order, but decided to get it reinstated. I was looking around and just couldn't find another that i liked enough to want to sacrifice the color, size and style of the one i originally ordered so I now I have to wait til fucking July for it, but i guess what's 2 more months when I'll have that sofa for a good number of years.  I stopped by a furniture store by my apt. and found the coolest fuckin cabinet. It was on sale for only $119... it's a little scratched up on the top surface, but its a floor sample, what do you expect. However i find it rather fantabulous and I'm going to have it delivered tomorrow night. if only I had another person around I could've just carried it back home the place is so damn close, but $55 for delivery will have to be paid. I wasn't even going to go into that store, but i figured why not just check out what they had on sale. It'll either be my TV cab or a liquor cabinet. we'll see how the TV, that I don't have yet, will fit on it.

      Two nights in a row of not going out. hmmm...I need to break this trend. Good thing tomorrow is Thursday. Might stop by Company before Niagara, now that I have found a long lost friend who works there. Change up the routine a little, instead of seeing the same old faces. Everything seems very stagnant right now. not sure why. I guess it comes and goes in waves. I've just been bored with everything. I think I am in need of my sofa to fucking get here so I can have people over...as well as other pieces of furniture, but that would do a helluva lot! Why am I so bored bored bored. This weekend for father's day I gotta go back to queens and give my dad some time off from watching my grandmother. that should prove to be whoopdeedoo, but he needs a lil breaky break. Next wed. I'm supposed to get ink... again, I hope I don't have to reschedule...again.

      So I went down to this bar that I'd never been in until last night where an old friend/guy I dated for all of 2 weeks in HS, Al, works. I hung out and had a few whiskys. It was good times just chatting and reminiscing. I happened to look down at the other end of the bar and saw a vaguely familiar face. Turns out, it was this kid, Mike, who I knew from my boring life while living in Boston/dated while in college. I hadn't seen him in a good 2-3 years. Weird. I go to this random bar that I've never been to, to visit a friend I haven't seen in at least 5 years. And it just so happens another kid that I knew had moved down here from shitty boston and lives above the bar which he hangs out in and where I went to visit. Mike had actually looked right at me, but apparently didn't recognize me, even though it hasn't been all that long...styles change I guess. So I got a 2 for 1 reunion. neat-o.

      So, Sunday is Peter's last day teaching in New Brunswick. He says he'll still be coming to new york...I'm gonna go for a visit down&nbsp;to DC&nbsp;in a week and a half, but hopefully I'll see him this weekend.  Although this is the end going to hang out there with him, it is not the end of New Brunswick as we know it. The guy who tattooes me is still there. Hopefully he's been working on drawing up my next piece. I can't wait to see what he comes up with. Unfortunately I won't be able to get started on it until either the end of August when he gets back from vacation or the end of September when I get back from vacation.  I'm going to England to visit my brother working there and then I'm gonna go over to Paris for a few days too. I'm going with my parents, which I can't complain about seeing as they are paying for my trip. I've never been on that side of the Atlantic so I'm psyched.  I went to see Bombay Dreams at the Broadway Theatre last night.&nbsp; It was really cute and the costumes were amazing. Then went to eat at 7A where we saw a roach crawling near us, ew.   &nbsp;

      It's true. Even us girls that&nbsp;are chill can&nbsp;get a little nutty sometimes.&nbsp; So I'm back to not hating guys again.&nbsp;I'm sure I will again soon, that's normal. In any case. I went to see the Bronx this&nbsp;past saturday at the&nbsp;Knitting Factory. Met up with Peter and Jeremy there. The singer was all belligerent and awesome. After that we went down to Niagara where we had a bunch of beers.&nbsp;So Peter and I talked about his dislike of talking on the phone. See. It's&nbsp;as simple as that and now I'm no longer&nbsp;annoyed. That's all he had to say, even though it's known that guys hate talking on the phone, but girls just need to hear it. Then Jeremy rode out to LI and Peter and I to NJ.&nbsp;Sunday got back to the city, walked around SoHo and Chinatown with my friend Emilienne, went to Park Slope with her too. Listen to ELO's Don't Bring Me Down like a billion times in her car going there and back. And that was it. At work now and passing the eff out.

      14/7/04 8:50 PM Jennifurry Liangus  12 hours of sleep in the last 3 days, those guys ended up crashing at my place the last 3 nights. Can't believe they played a show in PA and then drove from 1:30am and didn't get here until 6am, that fuckin sucked. Then they played again in nyc last night good thing we went out and drank a bunch again and my friend's bro, Gabe trashed again, made us laugh and also almost got us in some trouble. I almost got into a fight because some dumb bitch pushed him for dancing behind her friend. She didn't even do shit when I stepped to here. yeeeah and what! haha    11/7/04 10:50 PM Jennifurry Liangus  I didn't go to bed until 8am this morning. Last night was crazy. I met up with a friend at his brother's show. We were at the place for a while drinking beers then went to a couple other bars. stayed at this one place until it closed. Apparently they didn't have anywhere to stay that night, they all ended up crashing at my place. It was all kinds of crazy. sometime during the night...morning actually, I woke to go to the bathroom and found my friend's brother who got completely wasted last night bare-assed sleeping the the floor. It was hilarious. oh wait a night.     11/7/04 12:15 AM Jennifurry Liangus  YES! my television is no longer on the floor. I picked up my new tv stand today from crate and barrel...I almost threw out my back bringing it up my stairs and putting it together and then lifting my heavy ass tv to put on top of it, but it was well worth it. soon, shelves...aren't you guys excited as much as I am! ha :)     5/7/04 2:55 AM Jennifurry Liangus  boys with tattoos. yup. Happy Fifth of JULY everyone!!!!   Went to Black and White yesterday with Em, ran into Marie there. she was with her coworker, Jeremy and his friend Peter. He's cool.   22/6/04 8:35 PM   mystery of the rest of thursday night is solved. According to my friend Bryan, we walked out of the bar, he wanted to put me in a cab, but I told him I'd walk. So I did walk, but to another bar to visit with my friend Al. My friend Mike sitting at the end of the bar asked if I was ok, but all I did was star at him and finally asked for Al. Now, Al said I was uber fucked up. He asked if I wanted a drink, I replied in a low hoarse voice "water." And so he walked me out and put me in a cab. he claims when he opened the door I "fell into the cab" ahhh well. My thursday night story is thus concluded.     18/6/04 10:25 PM   Today was rough. I think I need to take a break from the drinking of whisky. The three hours I spent at work this morning consisted of me vomiting in the bathroom. And then I left and proceeded to vomit more at home. This is added to the vomiting out the window of the cab I was in last night, even after telling the driver (who was on his cell I think)to stop talking or he was gonna make me throw up. I also managed to black out at one point in the night. I think I need to work on that a bit.   6/6/04 6:20 PM  Speaking of more postings. I woke up at 3pm today. I stayed out drinking way past my bedtime. I went to a housewarming around 11, ditched that party to go to the bar around 1:30. It was fucking crowded. I hate Saturday night crowds. good thing my friend Ethan let me sit behind the bar to get away from all the crazy folk. It was another whisky night. got home around 4:30am. whoo. what a night. now i'm tired and hungry. the sopranos are on later tonight and that's about it. what a production weekend.
