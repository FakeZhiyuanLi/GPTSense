						    Back in the 1950s, British military scientists were developing a nuclear land mine to lay in the path of an invading (presumable Soviet) army. One of the obstacles the scientists faced in the days before solar cells and compact batteries was how to keep the plutonium core warm. One solution considered, according to papers recently made available, was to place a live chicken inside the plutonium core. A live chicken produces about 1,000 BTUs per day, enough to keep the plutonium warm and ready to go. No word on who would feed and clean up after the chicken. There is also no indication that the idea went anywhere, although interestingly enough, the project was codenamed "Blue Peacock."

      VANCOUVER - Luna the lonely killer whale is once again trying to get friendly with boats in B.C.'s Gold River, with disastrous results. The provincial fisheries department was warning boaters to stay away from the river after the orphaned animal nearly sank a sailboat earlier this week. Greg Middleton said Luna started throwing his boat around, breaking the rudder in the process. "The whale came out of nowhere," he said.    Middleton was able to get his disabled craft ashore and rig a makeshift rudder, but when he tried to leave the wharf, Luna came right back.    The young whale has been in the Gold River area for several years since being separated from his pod.    He quickly developed a liking for boats, often rubbing them as though they were fellow whales.    Middleton's sailboat isn't the only vessel Luna has been after lately.    He has also been chasing fishing boats, leading to renewed calls to remove the killer whale from the area.    The department of fisheries tried doing just that earlier this summer. They hoped to reunite Luna with its family.    But the local First Nation blocked those attempts. The band says the whale is the embodiment of its dead chief and that they want to take responsibility for Luna.    Fisheries officials are hoping this fall to negotiate a joint management plan with the band to protect both the whale and boaters.  Anybody else see a bad "your mom" joke coming from this? Meanwhile, what does it say about the First Nation's chief that he's supposedly now trying to hump boats?

        BrunO BiG NosE [10:29 PM]:      your blog needs more commentary    BrunO BiG NosE [10:30 PM]:      concrete detail, commentary    OK, Sophie.  I'll put more commentary.      Meh.  Maybe later.      In other news:       LOWELL, Mass. (AP), Aug. 21    - A man apparently on a cocaine binge died after he stripped naked, ran through a restaurant stabbing himself with a pen and tried to electrocute himself during a violent struggle with police.    ``Apparently, there was a witness, a girlfriend, who has indicated to us that he took cocaine intravenously, and this may have created this bizarre behavior,'' said police Superintendent Kenneth Lavallee.     Richard Wheeler, 33, of Lowell, went into the DoubleTree Hotel early Friday, grabbed a pen from the front desk and ran into the restaurant, said Verdell Ekberg, spokesman for DoubleTree's parent company, Procaccianti Group of Providence.     ``He was hurting himself, stabbing himself with the pen,'' Ekberg told The Sun of Lowell. He said Wheeler was not a hotel guest.     When police arrived, Wheeler - who had stripped naked - attacked the officers.     During a struggle in the restaurant kitchen, Wheeler tried to grab the officers' guns, threw a coffee carafe at an officer and urged police to shoot him. He also tried to stick his fingers in electrical sockets, police said.     `They attempted to restrain him as best they could,'' Lavallee said. ``They were able to do that, but it was after some time and a protracted struggle with this gentleman.''     He was taken, screaming and thrashing, to Saints Memorial Medical Center, where he later died.     An autopsy report was awaiting toxicology test results, but the death did not appear to be a homicide, said Melissa Sherman, spokeswoman for District Attorney Martha Coakley.     Three officers were injured, Lavallee said.       Silly Richard.  Crack is for kids...    (Does that count as commentary, Sophie?)

       WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sen. Ted Kennedy, the archetypal liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, is often called names by Republicans. But until this year he had never been viewed as a threat to U.S. air travel. Kennedy -- one of the most recognizable figures in American politics -- told a Senate committee hearing on Thursday he had been blocked several times from boarding commercial airline flights because his name was on a "no-fly" list intended to exclude potential terrorists.   The Senate Judiciary Committee heard Kennedy was eventually allowed on the flights, but it took numerous calls to the Department of Homeland Security to clear up the mistake and get his name off the list.      Noting it had taken him weeks to resolve the matter, Kennedy wondered aloud how difficult it might be for ordinary Americans to have their names removed if they were also mistakenly placed on the watch list.      A Kennedy spokesman said the whole thing had resulted from a simple error and had not been politically motivated.      Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge personally called Kennedy "to make sure that the situation was remedied," said a spokeswoman for Ridge's department.

       ATHENS (New York Times), Aug. 9- The ancient Greeks were the world’s first sports fans.      They loved games of all kinds, which they called “agones.”   Ancient Greece was a society of alpha males who took their fun seriously.      Whether they were at war with one another (which they often were, and which they got a huge bang out of) or enjoying more peaceful pursuits, they insisted that certain rules be followed and that there always be, right in the middle of everything, an agon.   In war, there was nothing that thrilled them more than a fight to the death, one army’s champion pitted against the other’s. In peacetime, they couldn’t just take in a poetry reading, listen to a concert, or watch a play. They had to enliven the proceedings with a poetry contest, a music contest, a drama contest. There always had to be a declared winner on whom the laurels could be heaped and at least one miserable loser. Even their parties, which easily developed into orgies, included contests over which participant could deliver the most eloquent toast or tell the funniest joke or get the farthest with the flute girl. Needless to say, it was the flute girl who lost.   If by sports we mean only a few guys kicking a ball around, the Greeks were not the inventors. Soccer in its simplest form has been with us ever since the invention of animal husbandry, soon after which some playful young shepherd probably kicked an inflated sheep’s bladder or a decapitated sheep’s head in the direction of another shepherd, who was inspired to kick it back. Certain bloodthirsty Celtic and Mesoamerican tribes – the Irish and the Aztecs, in particular – preferred human heads rather than sheep parts for such diversions, which soon developed into rudimentary team sports.   But if by sports we mean a series of organized contests of physical prowess, conducted according to acknowledged rules in the presence of enthusiastic crowds and scheduled well in advance to encourage participation by all the best athletes available for the sheer glory and fame of winning, we are talking about a purely Greek invention.

       HONG KONG (AP), Aug. 19 - Thieves scouring for scrap metal have looted dozens of stainless steel drain covers and other fixtures, including faucets, from public toilets in a Hong Kong neigborhood, a newspaper reported Thursday. The washrooms have lost 73 drain covers, four faucets, a steel gate and a hand dryer so far this year, the Apple Daily newspaper reported, citing police information. Police suspect the thieves targeted the fixtures, which are worth a total of $4,000 for their resale value, the report said. Police spokesman T.K. Ng said he had no information on the thefts.

        SEATTLE (Reuters) - A black bear was found passed out at a campground in Washington state recently after guzzling down three dozen cans of a local beer, a campground worker said on Wednesday. "We noticed a bear sleeping on the common lawn and wondered what was going on until we discovered that there were a lot of beer cans lying around," said Lisa Broxson, a worker at the Baker Lake Resort, 80 miles northeast of Seattle. The hard-drinking bear, estimated to be about two years old, broke into campers' coolers and, using his claws and teeth to open the cans, swilled down the suds. It turns out the bear was a bit of a beer sophisticate. He tried a mass-market Busch beer, but switched to Rainier Beer, a local ale, and stuck with it for his drinking binge. Wildlife agents chased the bear away, but it returned the next day, said Broxson. They set a trap using as bait some doughnuts, honey and two cans of Rainier Beer. It worked, and the bear was captured for relocation.

       CALGARY (Edmonton Sun), Aug. 17 -- A Calgary man could go to jail for lighting his co-worker's crotch on fire in a drunken prank that caused burns and scarring to 5% of the man's body. Michael William Cleare, 29, pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing bodily harm yesterday.   Jeffery Dale Lewis suffered second-and third-degree burns and permanent scarring to his inner thigh and genitals in the June 8, 2003, incident.   After a night of drinking, the two men returned to Cleare's southwest Calgary home.    After Lewis fell asleep on a chair with his legs spread apart, Cleare ran a lighter along the inside of the man's right thigh and crotch.    The intention, according to an agreed statement of facts signed by defence lawyer Bruce Corenblum and entered as an exhibit at Cleare's provincial court appearance yesterday, was for the heat to wake the man up.    Instead, Lewis's pants caught fire. He awoke and rushed to the kitchen where the two men extinguished the flames.    He then went back to sleep until the next morning when Cleare drove him to hospital.    Lewis later underwent surgery, during which skin was grafted to his upper thigh.

       So I'm working on those pesky essays... University of Chicago is on crack. Have you ever walked through the aisles of a warehouse store like Costco or Sam’s Club and wondered who would buy a jar of mustard a foot and a half tall?  We’ve  bought it, but it didn’t stop us from wondering about other things, like absurd eating contests, impulse buys, excess, unimagined uses for mustard, storage, preservatives, notions of bigness... and dozens of other ideas both silly and serious. Write an essay somehow inspired by super-huge mustard. Is it bad that half of my essays include some mention of either Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Pamela Anderson, or Janet Jackson?  Meanwhile, the new LD topic is out.    Resolved: Individual claims of privacy ought to be valued above competing claims of societal welfare.

         Sydney (The Independent, UK), Aug. 12- A cow-doping scandal has rocked the world of Australian agriculture after two award-winning farmers were ejected from the Royal Queensland Show for "udder tampering". The pair, together with two grooms, were disqualified after being caught injecting an unknown substance into their cows' udders to make them appear larger. Security guards observed them performing "a suspicious act" on the udders of 15 Jersey and Holstein Friesian cows in the dairy pavilion at midnight. The animals were due to be exhibited the following morning. Vivian Edwards, president of the Royal National Association, said: "It's beyond my comprehension that anyone would do this, but it's to enhance the performance, to make the udders bigger and more beautiful, and that's a plus in the judging criteria." Mr Edwards said other farmers were suspected of glueing cows' teats shut to prevent milk from leaking. The episode is being investigated by the police drug squad. One of the farmers, Waylon Barron, 22, will appear in Brisbane magistrates' court later this month, charged with breaching hygiene laws by failing to dispose of a syringe. Mr Edwards said that he hoped the firm action would serve as a warning to other farmers. "We strive to provide a level playing field, as they do at the Olympics," he said.    Here's the AACV media release on the story:   <>  The Australian Association of Cattle Veterinarians (AACV), a special interest group of the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), has raised concerns about the welfare of animals involved with the recent instances of udder tampering at Brisbane's Royal Queensland Show. Cattle veterinarian and President of the AACV, Dr Jamie McNeil says that the practice is completely unnecessary and does not take into consideration the health of the cows involved. <>"The artificial inflation of a cow's udder is completely stupid and can lead to health complications for the animal," says Dr McNeil. "Cows can develop mastitis, which is a painful swelling and tenderness of the udder, as well as other health complications."   Dr McNeil says that cattle veterinarians attending Agricultural Shows have been asked to keep an eye out for this sort of tampering.   "AACV members are particularly opposed to this and will carry out examinations using ultrasound equipment to ensure that this is not happening," says Dr McNeil.   "The animals are closely observed to ensure that their          health and welfare are not put at risk."   The AACV and the AVA want to encourage all people showing          animals to do so in the spirit of the competition.   "Animals should be presented as they were meant to be          without human enhancement," says Dr McNeil.

       Aug. 7 (Newsweek) - It didn’t sound like a hard question. After George W. Bush delivered a tepidly received address to a convention of minority journalists, a Native-American editor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer asked, “What do you think tribal sovereignty means in the 21st century?” As president and a former governor, the journalist said, Bush had a “unique experience, looking at [the issue] from two perspectives.” The president fumbled. “Tribal sovereignty means that—it’s sovereignty,” he stammered. “I mean, you’re a—you’re a—you’ve been given sovereignty and you’re viewed as a sovereign entity.” As Bush rambled, looking like a schoolboy unprepared at the front of the class, many of the hundreds of Asian, black, Native American and Hispanic journalists gathered before him…well, snickered.  Oh, Bush...  As for New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, Jay Leno commented: "Finally, a Democrat who can honestly say, 'I did not have sex with that woman.'"

       More happy news   <> ROME (Reuters), Aug. 12 - A retired Italian man could face up to a year and a half in prison if found guilty of killing his six pet hamsters and one guinea-pig by throwing them off his terrace into passing traffic. The man, detained by police after the guinea-pig crashed into the windscreen of a car, told officials that he had accidentally knocked the animals off his terrace while sweeping, AGI news agency reported on Thursday.   Police in the northern coastal town of Imperia discovered the hamsters' bodies littered across the street after the motorist complained about the broken windscreen. By studying the trajectory of the pets' bodies they were able to identify the pensioner's apartment. Under a new cruelty to animals law, the man could be sent to jail for between three to 18 months for killing the pets. He will also be held responsible for the damage to the windscreen.    CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP), Aug. 12 - Some motorists on Interstate 77 have complained about nude boaters, and others have stopped to watch. Boaters — with and without bathing suits — have attracted the attention of drivers in recent weeks, at times halting traffic at the causeway between Iredell and Mecklenburg counties and sparking complaints, said Iredell County Deputy Sheriff Phil Jones.   "They get right up to that riprap, and they take their clothes off," Jones told the Lake Norman Marine Commission this week.    Drivers get a good look at the water as they cross the causeway. There are rocks, called riprap, where the water meets land at the bottom of the causeway.    Jones knows of three calls the sheriff's office has gotten complaining of flashers, and he has heard of at least one accident blamed on flashers.   Marine commissioner Mark Lancaster of Iredell County confirmed Jones' report. He said he was in the area setting up for the July 31 Lake Norman Raft-Up, when he heard the honking of tractor-trailers and saw stopped traffic. Then he saw three naked women in a boat near the causeway.    The raft-up drew more than 1,400 boaters who tied their vessels together to create a new world record for such things. Marine commission Chairman Randy Reece said the N.C. Highway Patrol had asked the commissioners to consider moving the Raft-Up to a less visible spot next year.    But marine commissioners and law enforcement said the traffic problem wasn't limited to the Raft-Up or naked people. Drivers reported a southbound traffic jam Sunday caused by drivers watching boaters on the lake.    "I've seen traffic jams looking at the sunset," Reece said.    Reece said traffic problems started when the N.C. Department of Transportation took down the causeway fence and started trimming the weeds and underbrush that once obscured views of the lake.    Boats gathering at the causeway are a fairly recent phenomenon because boaters have had to leave an area in Iredell County where they once gathered, known as Cocktail Cove. Homeowners had complained about nudity and obnoxious behavior from partying boaters who tied their craft together.

       Came across this:      <>BRUSSELS (Reuters), Aug. 10 -   A cat running loose on a Belgian commercial flight attacked a pilot and forced the crew to turn back to the airport. The gray cat, named "Gin," broke out of its cage about 20 minutes after take-off and scurried to the cockpit where it scratched the co-pilot, SN Brussels Airlines said Tuesday. The flight with 62 crew and passengers had left Brussels for Vienna Monday when the cat, a prized animal that travels to cat shows around the world, started wandering around the passenger cabin.    "The passenger was asleep and at that point the cat managed to escape the cage," an airline spokesman said.   The cat managed to slip through the cockpit door as a flight attendant served lunch to the pilots.   The scared animal was "very aggressive and scratched the co-pilot," forcing the crew to return to the airport, the spokesman said.   The passengers were put on another flight to Vienna, without the cat and its owner, who had to take a separate flight there.  Don't see any intro possibilities here, but it's a good laugh.
