       I met a friend on MSN and her nick was, 'If God gave us eternal life, why does my life sucks?' Something like this...it was a few months ago and I managed to recall it but not accurately. Upon reading her MSN nick, I was dumbfounded...a bit of anger but not hatred. Honestly I did not chat with her about it... Now I've got alot to say about it, all in my mind and finally summarized it. A very straightforward answer to the question/nick is...' Cos' you refuse to glorify God or worship Him as king.' Eternal life is a gift from God. You won't gain eternal life by just snapping your finger or the next morning you wake up and tell yourself, "I'd gain eternal life already and I'm free to fly!' It does not work that way! It does not work that way! You must work to it.... After you receive salvation, learn more about God, read the Bible daily and pray. Slowly as you grow from strength to strength glorifying God, you'll soon realize that a Christian life is more than just attending church services, reading the Bible ,pray and even goinig to cell-group meeting. (if you have one.) If you're asking yourself," then how ca I receive this gift from God?" Accept the fact that Jesus died for our sins, confess your sins to Him and repent. Don't expect life to go so smoothly. Indeed, there will be tough challenges you'll face as you move on. Don't complain to God about why your life seems to be on a bumpy road, hot and cold, whatever you call it. When this happen , do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good. When you overcome evil, God kows and he will bless you. You will know that you've gain eternal life when you have this urge to share a powerful testimonial to a non-believer, you might even get him saved. remember, when a soul is saved, the kingdom of Heaven will rejoice. You will be blessed and knoowing th at the decision to accept Christ is not a regret but a wise one.

       Sometimes I ask myself, who do I put first in my life, me or God? Do I really love Him? Would I sacrifice my time such as playing games, working at my age for God? Honestly, I've been one who says I'm a Christian bt I dun act like 1. Not only me, I believe out there , there r many ppl who call themselves Christians...Yeah, it's true bt r they fulfilling God's purposes? If they r not, they dun have the rite to call themselves a Chrsitian...Would they sacrifce their work especially at my age for God? It juz proof tt they r money for lovers...I 'm not saying tt they can't work, it's juz how they manage their time when it comes to Service or Cell-Group Meeting. Secondly relationship...is having one with an opposite sex worth it? Can one support the other (also those around my age)? Or izzit b'cos they wanna show-off to their frens? It juz seems to be the wrong time... Have these ppl ever thought of repentance? The biblical meaning of repentance is: True Repentance is A Firm and Inward Decision... Inward change of mind, Out ward change of action...Think abt pride, lust and hatred...These attitudes occured to many ppl and it's hard to repent cos' they r being used to it.  Y I'm writing this is b'cos, I want to spread this opinion/message of mine to those 'Unchristian' ppl. I'm not here to criticise them. It's juz tt no Christians can stand these ppl. I've been one of 'Unchristian' ppl b4...Bt after a powerful message about Repentance my CG leader preached, it crossed my mind to reach out to these ppl and ask them repent without having to force. The 'Unchristian' ppl are spoling the reputation of wat i call a 'True Christian'. I'm not saying that we Chrsitians r perfect...in fact no one is...Mistakes r common but learn frm them so tt u would not repeat ut again...Same goes to repentance, u learn frm ur mistake and take total responsiblity tt u r wrong...  So here's one last message i would like to clarify:  Ppl out there who call urself Christians but u r not being wat i call a true christian, dun spoil we christians reputation! I f u luv God, then think abt repentance. Bt if u made up ur decision to seat on the throne and leave God after u...do it by all means...U r not only going against God bt also still being a sinner...Forcing u is so 'Unchristian'. Admit ur mistakes. God will not only forgive u, the Kingdom of Heaven will rejoice. Think about it...

       'Music is the soundtrack of your life..."      Familiar? Nevr mind if you heard it before or never...Well it's quite true anyway. Just imagine the world in silence without music...maybe vehicles on the street create music...haha! But thank God there is music...real music! It's one thing i can't live without.If you were to ask me what kind of music genre do I listen to, well, I'll say all sorts except Techno (Makes me giddy!), Rap (What's all that crap they rap?), Heavy Metal(There's no need to scream when you're singing!) and Jazz (Yawn!)      I started to listen to Perfect 98.7fm eversince I was 9. Back then, Backstreet Boys and Spice Girls reign the music scene. Who's next? Boybands? No way! Neither Techno nor Hip-Hop... Rock still suits me best. Alternative, Sentimental Rock, Hard Rock, Indie Rock, basicly all kindsof Rock music. Nu Metal too. It's something like Heavy Metal...just a bit lighter. Not so heavy until I bang my head along to the music likea mad man. Aiyoh! Very confusing...Ok short and simple, it is different. :p   For rock genre, I'm a fan of Evanescence, Seether, The Calling and Keane. Many will disagree if I say Evanescence is the best band...But hey! That's my opinion and you have yours! What makes Evanescence so fascinating? It is the haunting voice of lead vocal, Amy Lee....so cool! She's very pale you know? Can be Snow White...haha! The good thing about listening to Rock music is that it keeps you awake, better than drinking coffee.The combination of electric guitars, drums, bass and a lead vocal with a strong and powerful voice is just awesome! However, Keane is different...instead of using electric guitars...they mainly use the piano/keyboard with drums and a lead vocalist.... Very pleasant to the ears. Usually, I'll get soundtracks such as 'Daredevil' and 'The Punisher'. It gives me a wider range of Rock bands to look out for...mostly these bands were not featured on radio. That's how I got to know about Seether. Next to look out for, Finger Eleven, Smile Empty Souls...Rock rox!      Other than Rock music, I listen to Christian songs. They have the most meaningful lyrics...praising God with powerful words! Wow! What's great is that they praise Him with all kinds of music genres...from Pop to Adult contemporary, Dance to sentimental and even Rock! Yeah! Wow Worship (Red) is a must buy for all Praise and Worship fans and Chistian music fans alike. Erm...am I advertising? Never mind...the Wow Worship series will soon be a hit all around the world! There is this particular Worship song I have in mind eversince I first listen to it...It is "Above All' by Michael W Smith...it's such a powerful song with powerful praises...Should start listening to his music.      Being branded as 'Ang Moh' by alot of my friends because I always speak English, you can tell that I don't listen to Mandarin songs. Then in came F.I.R. (Their album is nice...worth it!) Magazines and newspapers reviewed them and dubbed them theEvanescence of or Oriental music...(Yeah you'll be thinking Evanescence, Evanescence again!) So it got me interested...So after all I've said, what's my favourite song? Or should I say 'All-Time'favourite? Well, it's got to be the slow music of 'My Immortal' by Evanescence! ( Scream until you feel like blowing up cos' it's Evanescence again!)  EVANESCENCE ROX!
