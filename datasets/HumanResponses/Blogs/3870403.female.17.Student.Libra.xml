       some people are so immature. not in the good way that makes you feel happy and young again. i'm talking about the malicious kind of immaturity like gossiping about the dumbest stuff. case in point: at work this girl said she hate my coworker because (according to her) the girls feet looked like skis in her chucks and she's mad dusty.  mad dusty ? whatthefxck??? she said she's mad dusty because her butt's always dirty from sitting on stuff that just so happen to be dirty. man. this girl has nothing to bother her. she needs a life. i asked her why she talks about ppl so much (a little is ok, but too much is just mean/stupid/immature/loser-ish). her word were, "i can say what i want, ain't nobody nowhere gon' do nothing and that's ma work na mean? dats ma word son. dat's ma word. ain't nobody up in here gon' do shit, na mean? dat's ma word. i keep it real, na mean? na mean? dat's ma word."      i know what you mean.       i got my name tag btw. it's official. funplex has just gotten more  rabid .

       urlLink       you remember those anime music videos by daft punk? well, they're all snippets from a movie. the movie is Interstella 5555. why so many 5's? because this movie is the "5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. ahh! i've heard good stuff about this movie and i do like Leiji Matsumoto's work, so one day i will see it. yes. that is on my to do list. yes.    ps~ i am sooo happy that the black guy in this is cute. black people in anime usually look like big lipped sea urchins... or something.

      it was nice. then i went to MAC. that was nice too. i got some hot, teal mascara. my parents think that sorta stuff is weird. that's ok. i don't like country music.  i saw a squirrel  fall out of a tree . now that's weird. think about it. it's like me falling out of my house. you think he would be used to it by now, with all that jumping and climbing he does daily. dumb squirrel. i wonder if they have squirrels in dominica. it's dom/in/EEE/ka, not dom/IN/ica. that pisses dominicans off. all 53 of them. they're all like, "ya dumb people." &nbsp; i have no socks.

       urlLink a touch of class  when i'm driving in my car i listen to my music. most people love the music that i listen to (only one person doesn't... ehem... no names...). one deejay/artists that i really like is  a touch of class . they make, remix, compile music. they're really low key. i love em. you can download some free music from this site by right clicking and saving target (i dunno about you mac users, that info's for my pc peeps). it's there, if you're keen enough to find it.

       urlLink    i wish this would happen to me... imagine going to work everyday (ho hum) and on the side, you make music. you think it's just a silly hobby, no big deal. then someone (influential) hears it, and BAM... you're famous. that is french graphic designer Marc Nguyen Tan's (aka Colder) story. man, that's pretty sweet. on this album, "crazy love" is a stand out track. i'm smitten. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 - Yahoo! Movies   i just came back from watching mike moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  and let me tell you... it is not for the faint of heart. watching it, i felt a plethora of emotions. i felt saddened by the mind set of our government, happy that some truth was being told to the public so that they can make a more educated vote at the polls. and some parts of that movie was so  hilarious ! i can see why it received the highest, most prestigious award at the Cannes Film Festival. i think we're seeing some history in the making. not just the film, but mike himself. i would like anyone to inform me of the last time a documentary was so  popular  at the box office. Documentaries are usually so boring like they chose topics of like, the mating habits of algae or something that's not that relevant to you or me (but then again, i don't really watch documentaries... so... yea). i had to write that this movie was money well spent (shit, for $9 something, it was well worth it).

      i went to new york yesterday to get my hair did. on the train i met a writer whose coming out with a book about how faith (any kind of faith) helped women who were abused get through it. i thought that was kind of cool, but then she told me her name... cinderella. her name is  cinderella . she showed me her drivers license and sure enough she was right. she was cool. while in n.y. my mom got a tattoo. NO NOT a REAL one, a henna tattoo. it was a very spiritual experience. i was like,  whoa . henna. then some random ass dude came outta nowhere and was like,  is that weed? is that hemp?  the lady doing the tattoo was like,  no it ain't hemp. what an idiot. whould ya look at this guy? what a IDIOT!  can you use weed to color your skin? no? didn't think so. OH... and i never did get my hair done.

      ...i just came back from an interview with blockbuster. it went well, except for the fact that my interviewer said i might not get the job due to my long list of criminal activies that include 67 DUI's, possession of illigal substances (someone told me opium and mary jane were ok), and random cock fighting charges. but i remain hopeful and optimistic.  you know what's a good song for all my peeps who like old music (70s)... lou christie's  lightnin' strikes . it's so  real .
