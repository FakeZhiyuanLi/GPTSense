      So today was good. I was up entirely too late last nite (5:30 am) and I pretty much assumed that today wouldn't be good for anything. But, I knew Aubs would wanna do something and frankly I wanted to, also. So I dragged myself out of bed at 11. We played tennis a great deal today and it was great fun. Then Aubs and I saw Dodgeball which is hillarious! After that we went to Goodwill and bought tennis rackets. Now I'm in Heaven or at least Tennis Heaven cuz we have all the proper equipment to play tennis non-stop till the day I die, and not hafta take turns. :) I am so addicted and I'm not even that good. It's also hilarious, but Dodgeball is a bit more so. Then Wheat team. I was not looking forward to this, cuz it's like a little TEC community there, and last time I majorly felt like an outsider. But this time Kristin was there, and she really seemed excited to see me and content hanging with me. This made me have that mushy yet non-lesbonic feeling inside that Kristin gives me when I am enjoying her company. So I felt like a butt for going to Dodgeball without her cuz we had planned on seeing it together, but then we planned on seeing the Notebook, and I won't break that. I talked to more kids on my wheat team this time and I feel as tho, perhaps with some of them I may be crossing the Acquaintance Bridge on to the Friend Ship. Then when I got home my parents said the 2 magic words that make me a puddle of girlfriend goop: 'Darin called.' :D We talked and planned our date for tomorrow. It's Spiderman 2 at Rave, hopefully with Aubrie and Andrew Twaddle. That would be so awesome. And now I just can't wait to go to bed cuz I miss sleep!

      I haven't gotten to write in awhile so I sort of have alot to say. I don't even know where to start. I guess it all started when I had a really horrible nite at Lindy's. It was just a huge progression of letdowns, like falling down the stairs, slowly but still painfully, or there were just alot of stairs. First, I got to work and Adrienne wasn't there. (She was supposed to be) What a letdown. The possibility of this happening didn't even cross my mind. Suddenly I wanted to be there as much as I wanted to be held at gunpoint. But the gunpoint thing actually looked more appealing considering that Scott McClellan was there. Scott McClellan my number one fan who for reasons beyond my comprehending actually hardcore HATES me. And Clay the mean manager was managing. Clay, who thinks I have the IQ of a hampster and can't do anything rite. So needless to say I was less than stoked about my evening. I just kept thinking about what I'd do after work. About Kristin. She's actually let me down recently, and I don't even know if she realized it. I guess it's not that big of a deal but she said that she would come over one day after her physical and I just waited and waited and waited, and then went to work. She called the next day, but didn't say anything about it. She said she went to work but that's it. Maybe that was her way of saying she was sorry. Anyways, she's still my best friend, even tho, also by the way, She can't decide on a best friend! Hmm, that killed. Oh well, life goes on rite? So where was I? Oh ya. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt, cuz I know she means well. On this fateful day, she had given me a glimmer of hope. Before I left she had called and I told her I was going to work, but she said that she'd stop by afterwards and we could hang. I was so excited. I got to thinking that maybe she could then spend the nite like old times and then we could just go to mass together. BUT about 10 minutes before I got off, there she was with Kev. I knew this couldn't be good. She said that she was gonna do something with him. :( I felt tossed to the side like a sack of potatoes. But then by the grace of God, or maybe Kristin suggested it, (I really hope the latter) Kev came back in the store and invited me to come over, too. So then I was fine. It wasn't what I really planned, but I wanted to hang with Kristin and I would still get to. I top off my nite with a drawer that's short money, of course. Then I get in the car and ask to go to Kev's. Mom's answer: No. In fact, I can't go anywhere, or do anything because I'm grounded...BECAUSE the f-ing house didn't get cleaned. Great. Take my first free nite from me in weeks. It'll just make the decision of leaving or not that much easier. Don't worry, one day my room will be so clean it will depress you. It'll be all yours to control and no one will mess up your beautiful home, everything of mine will be gone including me and maybe if I remember nites like that one, I won't come back.  I actually journalled that one the old fashioned way since I was grounded from the computer and then nutshelled it.  Sunday I was grounded. I saw Kristin at church and didn't talk to her much. Oh ya, I forgot. My parents still let me call Kristin and tell her why I couldn't come. She didn't really seem to care. I told her to have fun and she said, alrite. So I think I was sort of short with her at church. I don't know if she noticed. But I was alittle mad. I spent the day with Laura since we were both sharing the same sentence. The rents still let us play tennis for some odd reason and it was pretty fun. We took advantage of our momentary freedom and also went to the park. Ha, take that parents! Ya, I know, I'm a rebel. I think I also worked that day, but it wasn't as bad. On bad nites, my pet name for Lindy's is the "hellhole," on Sunday it was just, the "job." Cuz I worked with Kelsy, and it was, well it wasn't hell. When I got home, I wasn't grounded anymore and Darin called. Since it wasn't too late, we decided to do something. He came over and we ended Jurassic Park, from the first time we went out. Ha, I think that's just great.:) We ended up making out quite a bit. Nothing more of course, but still, it was quite a bit. The nite ended on a bittersweet note, when my dad walked in to find us in a position that looked bad, but really wasn't. It was my fault, he had already said that he was leaving, but what can I say? I'm a sucker for kissin. Before we got into all that I told him that I finally had a day off work and we planned to do stuff on Monday.  Monday was a really eventful day. It began with going to Roxannies, who called me about third in her line of friends (I called her first) and we made "mystery pancakes" for Kristin cuz she was really late. Kristin and I seemed just fine, so I totally let the past go, obviously she didn't mean anything by anything she did or didn't do. And I believe we are fine now. We ate a ton of pancakes, then decided to go bowling. We were gonna ask Andrew for a ride, but then we decided to just ask him to join us. It was great fun, I think he really enjoyed himself too, which made me happy. He's a good kid. Then we made and ate macaroni. Roxanne and Kristin were too full from pancakes still, but I was starving, so I ate most of it. Then we decided that we wanted to go to the pool. It was freezing and we spent about 5 minutes actually in the water. Then we talked to Andy in concessions and ate again. After that, we started to walk somewhere, and decided that Jennna's would be cool. But it wasn't a good time for her or something so we walked on, till we were tired. Then we just called Roxanne's mom for a ride. When I got home I called Darin and we went and played tennis. It was pretty fun I thought, then went to his house and finished Top Gun. Oh and lifted weights. We started to watch another movie, Training Day I think. And talked a bit. Then we went for a walk in the park. It was kinda cold and kinda wet, but we kept eachother warm. We looked up at the stars and talked alot. It was really nice. The brightest one in the sky is "Kate" by the way, if you wanted to know. Then we kissed quite a bit again. We never really cut it short. I like kissing tho, so I'm not complaining, just observing.  So then the next day was today. Aubs had come that nite and visted with the whole family but me, so we planned to do something. We rode our bikes to the tennis courts and played for a really short while. (me, Aubs, Laura, and Rachel) and then went to Lindy's to get food for the clarinets. We rode to Wenger Shelter for the 2nd and probably last clarinet party. I saw Raquel, which was very exciting. She has a job in Metamora and a boyfriend, also from Metamora. The "party" consisted of Me, Roxanne, Betsy, Mike, Steph, Lauren (May) and non-clarinet people Laura, Aubs, Rachel, and Kristin. It was basically me giving ideas and people shooting them down. So I'm quite sick of the whole stupid band scene for now. It makes me not want to 'lead' them anywhere. Let em get lost for all I care. Nate was there playing frisbee golf and I said hi to him and bye to him. I rode my bike to hollands but by the time I got there, the girls were gone. I felt bad, I had left them hangin for too long. I went back up to Lindy's to drop off my schedule then I went home. All on my bike. Fun stuff. Then I hung out with the girls for what seemed like a split second then I had to go to work. (concessions) The most eventful thing was that the health inspector showed up. It's seriously not sanitary back there! I felt so paranoid. But they didn't shut us down.:) Debra had a game so I got to see her and all the people that came to see her, so that was cool. Then I got home.  Darin didn't call. I know, I know, he shouldn't hafta call everynite, but it's just that it's the first nite that he hasn't in a long time. And it's just kinda hard. Ha I'm such a loser. I like him so much but I don't know if I can even tell him cuz he has a really hard time talkin about stuff like that. I decided that I like that situation better: that he cares, but can't really express with words how much he cares, rather than a guy who just says he cares, but by his actions, I wouldn't know it. *cough* Andy...*cough* Parrott* cough cough* Oh well. Life goes on.  I guess the biggest dilemma now is that my friends don't like Darin. Not only that, but they don't want me with him. I HATE this. I guess I know they mean well, cuz our relationship before wasn't totally flawless, but it's really not their call. Anyways, I can't believe that they wanna take all this happiness away from me. Darin makes me feel like I'm intersting, special, and completely amazing. They make me feel like an afterthought. I know they can't totally give me undivided attention all the time and only be my friend, but man! whenever I feel left in the dust and forgotten, Darin will call up and ask me to do something. It seemed for awhile we were really busy, but tried to fit in as much time together as possible. Any moment, we both had free, was automatically time we'd spend together. Or on the phone. It was so exciting and so fun. I felt like I couldn't get enough of him and I thought maybe he felt the same way. I felt like someone's best friend again.

      Aww another journal. I never thought I'd do this. Start another I mean. But I got this really good idea from one of my friends. She told me that she had a journal but no one reads it, no one knows her name. It's just for her. I thought that was the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I mean, what's the point in having one of these things if you don't let people read it.   But then I got to thinking, the only reason my journal b4 got so old was because I wasn't really writing about what was going on in my life or how I was really feeling because I was either afraid of offending someone or of simply being judged. And seriously, what's the point of that? So I decided that maybe a journal like this is just what I need. I still sort of worry about this tho. I mean, I can just see all my private business being spilled out all over cyberspace and being discovered. So I thought maybe I'd change my name. I thought this would put my mind at ease, but then I thought on and thought, maybe I should change my friends names, give them code names, just in case. Okay, that's not that bad, but then I thought well maybe I should change my job, or activities and have a code instead, and then I realized that I wouldn't have a journal when I was done, I would have a complex code that even I probably wouldn't be able to crack in the end.   I mean, how messed up am I? I must be one paranoid mess. Then a little voice inside my head said, "You gotta let the world find you someday. So what if they see you for who you really are? I mean, so what if people finally, by some odd stroke of luck or unluck, find out what you really mean when you say 'okay' or 'sure'? so what if they find out that you feel the way you do about things? What are you hiding from?!" So that's what I struggled with last nite. My soul wanting to talk, but my brain saying, "No, just make smoke signals or something, it's safer that way." I wonder if other people struggle with this too when they write in their journals. I mean, obviously, they worry alittle, rite?  And no one shall reply. Ha.

      So ya, it's me again. Life has been spectacularly excellent, so truly wonderful that I didn't know what the heck was going on. Life is not supposed to be that easy. But seriously, everything was going my way and it was really freaking me out. And then, Shabam! I suddenly remembered that love is a rollercoaster ride and that rollercoasters go down! Not only do they 'go down' but they have these things called 'drops' and if this were an actual rollercoaster I would tell you that those are my favorite part, but since I'm talking about my life, I'm just gonna say that they aren't. The whole ordeal was so stupid that I don't even wanna go into the details. It's the deadest dead horse and it's had the shit beat out of it so we're just gonna let it RIP, okay?.  It was made better by flowers, if you were wondering, and talking, but mostly flowers.  I saw one of the worst movies ever made tonite, the Village, but I wanna see if I can fool anyone into wasting their money too, cuz I feel like an idiot. And then I spent time with Dar and remembered all the reasons why I love him. I'm still not so completely comfortable with him to the point that it's just crazy, I don't think I wanna get there again either, cuz well that's just, crazy! I was talkin about resting all I've got on one person and how I'm not gonna do that, and then I just go and do it anyways, and well, that just sucks, cuz no one is perfect and letting others down is just how we're programmed, it's just a matter of time. All that matters is the recovery.

      You were everything  Everything  That I wanted  &nbsp;  We were meant to be  Supposed to be  But we lost it  &nbsp;  All the memories  So close to me  Just fade away  &nbsp;  All this time  You were pretending  So much for my happy ending&nbsp;  &nbsp; (Avril)  &nbsp;  You said to me  How could it be  That we'll make it  &nbsp;  It's just to far  We'll lose it all  So let's just break it  &nbsp;  I love you so  I'll let you go  Just fade away  &nbsp;  I know rite now I'm not that happy  But I know it's not my ending&nbsp;  &nbsp; (Me)  &nbsp;  So ya, this is what was going thru my head all day yesterday. I thought I had pretty much lost Dar and I was pretty upset. I just felt so let down. I felt like everyone has let me down and it was just a matter of time b4 Dar did also. He meant waaay too much to me. That's why I was suddenly crashing down again and it was only about a 2 month relationship.  &nbsp;  Some songs are really unhealthy to live by. I used to sing.  Feels like I can finally rest my head on something real and I like the way that feels  but if you think about it, you can't really just rest all your faith on one constant person or thing. Life is constantly changing and rearranging and you hafta change with it or you'll get&nbsp;ripped apart&nbsp;by the razorblade hands of the clock. Gory? Fallopia!  &nbsp;  As it turned out, Dar didn't wanna break up, he just wanted to talk about stuff. I felt like a big retard. I never realized how differently we thought about things b4 now. I mean, I always thought that I understood Dar in a way that no one else really did or tried to and that he understood me, but now I see, well I guess I just see that it might not be the connection that we probably won't find again or anything, it might just be how we both care about each other and enjoy being with each other.  &nbsp;  I finally told him all my skeletons so he's got that to swallow too. I think he's doing well with it tho. I know he cares alot about honesty and that's why I told him, but honesty is what lost me the guy last time. Well I guess it wasn't honesty, it was the thing I did that I had to be honest about, but anyways, I guess, honesty may be the best policy, but it's also the hardest with not always favorable consequences. Oh well, be honest, it saves time. Also, I got to thinking that if it scares him away, I mean, my life, uncut, uncensored, then it's not meant to be and he doesn't deserve me. Because I have so much more to offer than my past, and I think Dar knows that. And if he stays anyway, then I know it's because he really cares, and maybe someday  loves .  &nbsp;  It wasn't that I was picking out curtains or anything, but I guess I was getting too lost in the idea that Dar was the ONE...ah. I'm so sappy. I just get so comfortable with people. I think I just love to love and be loved.&nbsp; Oh ya, love, I'll get back to that in a second. Anyways, after Dar told me that he wasn't planning on breaking up, he also told me that that doesn't mean forever. That doesn't mean that he doesn't want to break up EVER, it's just that, for now, he still likes me and wants to see where it will go. Smart kid. I was just kinda bein a girl I guess, and wasn't thinkin too realistically for awhile.  &nbsp;  And the  love  thing. Well. I do love Darin. I think that's why I've been searching for the true meaning of  love  for awhile. Just to make sure that it's real this time. But there's no way that it's not. I take back what I said before about  having  to say it or it not&nbsp;being&nbsp;real. Cuz quite frankly, I can't say it to him because he's not in the rite place to hear it. He doesn't know what love is and doesn't think he'll know till he's 20, so telling him now will just confuse him. I've known it for a long time tho. It may seem really stupid, but I can pinpoint&nbsp;places in time when it just affirms and reaffirms the fact that I honestly and truly love him.

      I've missed a ton of days, but I'll try to fill you in cuz tons of great stuff have been happening. The biggest one, definitely worth mentioning is my wheat team experience. Okay, that's probably all I'll talk about, but it was so awesome. I couldn't have hand-picked a better team. Claudia was definitely one of my favorite gals. She was pretty quiet but if you got her talkin she was pretty interesting. Alicia was definitely awesome. She's just so sweet, she could be friends with anyone. Colleen, bless her heart, opened up her home to me and let me stay the nites with her so that I wouldn't hafta go home each nite, and she barely even knew me. Mark and Mark were definitely my favorite guys. I'm really gonna miss Mark Joseph's singing and Mark Hocking's...well Mark Hocking. And Dane was a totally cool kid to talk to. I enjoyed his company. The whole rest of the team was totally awesome too, but rite now, that's who comes to mind. Oh and the leaders were awesome! I know I'm totally going to miss all of them.  &nbsp;  The best part of the weekend tho, was the look on the candidates faces and the team. Wow, they were so full of love and gratitude it was enough to bring tears to your eyes. My eyes are even sort of watering now just&nbsp;talking about it.&nbsp;I'm becoming such a wuss about that kinda stuff, I mean, this morning I cried during Dawson's Creek when Joey told the little girl that her daddy was a hero and saved her life when he really mugged her, and I cried during Saved by the Bell when Kelly's dad lost his job and Kelly couldn't go to prom. I seriously get mad at myself when my eyes well up. I'm starting to worry about myself.  &nbsp;  So also, much has been happening with me and Dar. For awhile I thought I was falling in love with him and this scared the heck out of me. One, because he's leaving, but also because I hate being that vunerable. The closer you let urself get to someone, the harder it is to walk away from it all.  &nbsp;  Anyways, then i went to TEC and I experienced life without him for awhile and I realized that I could make it. At first I missed him so much, but then I relaxed and had a great time. When I got home, my heart wasn't nearly in the same place as it had been when I left. I don't know what this means, but I think it's a good thing since he is leaving no matter what. I'm still really scared for that day to come when he leaves because I know I'm gonna miss him like crazy. I'm still trying to figure out how I really feel about him, but I know that if I've ever loved anyone, it's him. I mean, the things that I love about him are real things, deep things. The way he makes me feel is real, and the way I love myself when I'm with him, that's real.&nbsp; I just don't know if the L-word is really appropriate to actually say to him, so I guess it isn't. I bet if he said it to me, I'd say it back in a heartbeat, which I feel terrible about, because, how sincere is that? I think I a real "I Love You" doesn't need one back. I guess I'm just too scared and vunerable. Man I hate that. Ha. 'To love is to be vunerable.'

      "I guess that's why we hold on to them so tightly and for so long. (first loves) We can't believe that such a miracle could happen to us twice."    -Someone Like You   That's a movie I saw and I thought it was like my life. Plus I thought the quote was really really good. I haven't seen the movie for awhile so it's not nearly exact, but it's exactly as I remember it.:) My first love was a joke. I hate that I ever felt so strongly for someone so evil.  I wanted so long to just move on from him and fall in love again, but as the song goes:  You can't hurry love, no, you'll just hafta wait cuz love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take.  I rushed into thinking that i loved someone that I didn't even really know. I don't even know him well enough to miss his company now.   So this time I definitely don't wanna rush into saying anything or believing that I feel a certain way until I'm absolutely sure.   True love is like a glass slipper. It either fits or it doesn't. You can't fudge it alittle, and it won't give alittle if you're foot's too small...you get it. It's precious and not a causual thing, you wouldn't wear it to play sand volleyball, just like you don't throw around the word love like, wow he's so hot, I LOVE him, or he's all I've got so I LOVE him, or he just bought me a taco, I LOVE him. :)  To me 'love' should only be what you say when no other word could possibly come close to describing the way you feel about someone and not saying it is just painful. Then you know it's love.

      Today was cool, but tonite was awesome! I went to see Spiderman 2 with Dar and that movie was amazing. I knew it had to be at least semi-decent because I hadn't met anyone who had a bad thing to say about it, but I didn't know that it would change my life. (Just kidding, exaggerating, whatever) Anyways, I'll be seeing it again soon. Then we went to Borders, just like me and Nate did. But this time, we didn't split up like before, Dar actually went to the section that interested me and we looked at books together. It was a million times better than going with...umm someone else and looking all alone. The night was equally good cuz Dar and I talked alot. I have so much fun talking to him and feel like I can really be myself. We get so lost in conversation at times that I totally forget to check myself to make sure that I'm being interesting or assertive. I forget to act like the new improved me that I had planned on being, but somehow, being regular old Konstantine is more than enough. This feeling is indescribable. I felt like such a loser when I lost Nate due to my lack of opinion and personality that he didn't really come out and claim but hinted at, that I felt like radical change was the only way to save my poor excuse for a love life. But with Dar I feel like the person that I am is a person worth loving, just as I am.

      Ok, so Roxannie found out that I'm still in love with Parrott. She wasn't all that surprised. She thought that deep down he still loved me and that our relationship was different and that we could make it work. But, that my friends, is what my dreams are made of. There's no way ever that it would work. Stupid hope. It never dies. Wanna read his profile?  I'm so happy I've got Kaitlin back in my life again :-D  I've got you back And you're in my arms again I'm never going to let you go I just want to close the door And be with you for all eternity Cause you're back in my life  Ain't it beautiful folks? It's fine. I mean, he's doing me a favor, because it would never work. Roxannie thought the only thing holding him back was that he was so scared of getting hurt. I let her sit in for one of my conversations with him and she changed her mind alittle. I guess she was just mis-informed. She saw what was going on from my perspective and now she sees it's impossibility, also. Maybe if I just block him again, I'll be okay. But I'm so scared that that will only be hurting the healing process and I'll be messed up later down the road. I wish I could just hate him forever, but he doesn't give me enough reason. He doesn't give me any reason to love him, but I'm pretty good at that. Ahh! Make it stop!  Someday!

      How strange is this? I keep trying to rationalize it for myself. How could love die so fast with me and Dar, and over almost nothing and live for over a year with me and Par when he practically sent me into therapy from how much he hurt me.  I think what happened was that I was in love with Darin because he hadn't even had the chance to fail me yet. I'd never seen the downside to him, then when I did, well I realized that it wasn't love at all. That's why I'm so careful about saying it. What if I had told him that I loved him?? Cuz I really thought I did. Wow, that would have really sucked now. I've definitely seen the downside in Par. I think I've seen it more than the good. But I have seen the good, and I love him, good and bad together. Nobody's perfect. Love isn't about finding the perfect person, it's about seeing an unperfect person perfectly. Or something like that.  It's a lost cause really. Time to move on again. I feel like I say goodbye to him every time I see him, maybe even days that I don't. Will I be doing this my whole life? Always settling? God, I hope not.

      This entry is the reason why no one can ever read this journal that knows me. This is something that I need to say that no one can ever hear.  Yahoo! so let's go. So I'm not in love with Darin anymore. Does that mean it wasn't real? Man. Love is complicated. We're not really fighting or anything. I mean, we're just fine for the most part, but I can't shake my first love. I know that I love him. I thought that that had died but every time I see him I know that it's still there. Whenever I go for a long time without any contact with him, I can just pretend that he doesn't exist and it gets me by, but I was pretty much forced to see him for a week and a half and well I didnt come out of it so well. I'm pretty sure he's moved on and found someone else that he's crazy about, which I thought I had done. He doesn't know that I still love him and what he does to me, so that's at least good. It's insane how much power he has over me. He can make me feel awesome and pathetic. I hate this. I'm pretty sure that I can either love him or hate him and nothing in between. What does that mean?  Someday it will stop. It just has to. Someday I'll find peace with this. I'd like to think that by the time that I'm 80 I'll be able to be in the same bingo hall as him and not want to cram my bingo chips in his eyes or wish that he was my grumpy old man rather than the one I got.  I've been talkin to him about his new girl and well, it hurts but at the same time I love being a part of his life again, if only that small of a part, and I want to still try to make him happy, bcuz I know despite the mask that he puts on for the rest of the world, he is a good guy, and he deserves to be happy, heck everyone does.  The saddest part of the story is that even if he would come back to me, no one in the entire world would understand. NO ONE! I've hated him for so long and well everyone that cares for me hates him too because of what has happened between us. I feel like a big retard with alzheimers bcuz I know that sometime in the past he hurt me really bad. It's like I just don't care or choose not to remember. It doesn't matter anyways. Nothing can ever happen between us again. I guess, if you can't be with the one you love, you should just be with the one you like second best.  I love you, Brandon Parrott.
