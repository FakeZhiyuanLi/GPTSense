       CD: Gorillaz, "Gorillaz"  I was going to wait until it was officially tomorrow to write tomorrow's blog, but I have several papers to produce by tomorrow morning so I better get this out of the way. My secret problem as a future educator is that I have major procrastination problems and poor study skills. When I was in high school I did not have to study, excepting the odd French test. (My ill will towards the French ought to be documented in a later entry.) But I actually TRIED to study. I would sit there with a book and some notes and after a half hour my mind would exclaim, "I can't do it! How do people do this?" Learning seemed to come pretty automatically to me and when it didn't, I accomplished what I had to through trial and error. This probably led to my current procrastinations. There was no effect on my grades--or even my level of knowledge--no matter what amount of time I relegated to study. So I would simply do everything at the last possible minute to save the greatest period of time to other interests. Interests like, um, idleness. So I could have started writing all of these papers three days ago, formulating hypotheses, rewriting and proofreading. Get a nice big A. OR, as I had in the past, I can start my papers at midnight the night before they're due, write whatever's on my mind, and get, on average, an A-. Or an A, who knows. Come to think of it, maybe that's what I should teach the kids: sometimes it's just not worth it. You know, Preparation for the Real World. Hey, a new episode of South Park starts in 10 minutes; maybe I'll watch that first before I settle in.

       CD: Radiohead, "Kid A/Amnesiac B-Sides" [mix]  It may be simply because of the area I get my literature from, which happens to be a mostly Catholic, Democrat-run city in a state that normally elects Democrats to federal office. (Hillary Clinton? Who checked her credentials?) In any case I have never read an "alternative" paper touting a mostly rightest viewpoint. I don't have any problems with the left--well, actually I have problems with both the right AND the left--but it would be nice every once in a while to be able to pick up a paper and NOT see the A to Z on how Bush is destroying the country/economy/environment singlehandedly, and how Dick Cheney is part of a vast right-wing conspiracy to support terrorism and the oil industry and kill our precious children who, of course, would never vote for a Republican. When it comes to weeklies or other non-mainstream media, it is either moderate liberal (e.g. "Blue Dog") or socialist/Marxist. In a recent count I found 3 of each kind at a university. As for right-wing representation? Zero. Been that way for (at least) five years. Is the media really that liberal? Is this a nationwide phenomena? Is the right so entrenched in the ideology of status quo that it finds no reason to synthesize political thought with day-to-day, public conversation? Is the intelligencia of this country so far left they fail to quantify the maxims of Republicanism (that they stole under the Clinton/Gore administration)? Am I making any sense here? When it comes to political discussion, all I want is A) levity and B) brevity.

      CD: PJ Harvey, "Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea"  The goal tomorrow morning is to send out at least 8 job applications to their respective places of buisness. This, of course, has been my goal every morning since February. On some days I have sent out two or three, but most mornings my field is quite fallow. I have never been fond of applications: one, because of the paperwork, and two, I can't stand self advertisement. But it's mostly the paperwork. Princeton once sent me an application--I never asked for one so that must mean something (?)--and I decided to pass because it was 16 pages long. I only applied to two colleges, and then to only one grad school. They all accepted me, yet I'm sure this is not fear of failure I'm worried about. It's the fear that I'll have to get up in the morning and type out--AGAIN--a list of five references. And then references. "Why do you want to work...?" I don't! Eating just happens to be a prerequisite for homeostasis, and somehow I must support this dirty habit!  You may be asking yourself, "If he's spending so much time on a precocious weblog, why can't he do the same for his precious applications?" Clueless myself. This was my aim with a weblog: get back to the computer and type. About yourself. And get it done by morning!

      CD: Mouse on Mars, "Niun Niggung"  Random notes today:  --Working on my farmer's tan. No watch outlines this time!  --Why oh why are envelopes such a pain to print on? Who do you call?  --I've been using a sleeping bag since I've moved. Yes, a sleeping bag. In June. If I were rich, however, I would throw the sleeping bag on the campfire and sleep on the marshmallows. You know what I'm sayin'?  --No? Neither do I.  By the way, what does "Niun Niggung" mean?  --Grad school starts in 10 hours. This better not suck. I hope I don't get one of those "enlightened" teachers who like to use group activities and grade by participation. It's especially worse for us education majors. I should write more on this subject later.  --New World Record is giving me a Buy-1-Get-1-Free coupon for my Britney Spears haiku! Well E-mail my heart, I won something.  --15 minutes of searching, and I still can't find out what "Niun Niggung" means. Curses, Babel!

      CD: various Smashing Pumpkins: Machina-era B-sides   Just Like the Special Olympics.  Last night I got an E-mail from the independent store New World Records that said the following (paraphrases):  "These are good seats [to the Britney Spears concert], and all you have to do to win a pair (of tickets) is be one of the first three people to e-mail us with a Britney haiku* and a viable phone number. If you’re one of the [first] lucky three, we’ll call you back and tell you to hustle on down here for your tickets. So hurry up and hit that ‘Reply’ button!"  And I did! Now, I never would have won, because I opened the E-mail six hours after it was sent out. But haikus! It's like Poetry for Dummies. I quickly wrote up and sent out a response:  She's not just a girl... Teenage pop sells soda pop My Pops likes her, too  I'm actually quite proud of that one. Not really because I thought it up in less than a minute, or that it used THREE different definitions of the slang word "pop," or that I actually participated in one of these goofy contests! No, I'm proud of it because IT WASN'T DIRTY. Oh man, the mental war I had to wage to keep it that way! The image of Britney Spears is such that one can barely keep away from risque thoughts! Even New World Record had to write:  *Remember, that’s five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, and five in the third. Neatness counts, and points will be deducted for tastelessness.  Who cares what the results say. I still FEEL like a winner.

       CD: L7, "Smell the Magic"  A real day off! Nothing pressing to do. Sleeping in was great for the constitution, as seen from my previous entry. But how to keep busy? Well, there was that whole "start excersizing" idea I once had, so I went down to the garage to find my bike, check the tire pressure and be on my way to good health and a reunion with nature. Ready to go, I open the door and . . . it's raining. I would've gone in a drizzle but this was just enough to make me turn back. For a minute I stood there under the threshold with a blank stare. "The one time I didn't want an excuse . . . . "  Luckily my new favorite satellite station, WorldLink TV, played several good documentaries about the Zapatista movement and the maquiladoras of Mexico that kept my interest a good part of the evening. But, man, I really wanted to ride my bike!

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Machina II: The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music"  I've slept much better since I've moved. This has led to some really intriguing dreams. Last night, I was at a party with Puff Daddy. Not P. Diddy, I noticed, but good ol' Puff Daddy. Anyway, so we were just hanging out with a bunch of people. And Puffy was showing me around the place. I also noticed that whatever he did, soon everyone at the party would do. So if he was just socializing/drinking champagne, I would look around and everyone would be doing the same thing. Then he decided to lay down in the middle of the floor, where a large number of throw pillows just happened to located. Everyone else did the same. It was all very classy. He was eventually making out with someone else (everyone partnered up and did likewise) so I devoted my attention to the lady next to me, who just happened to be the dark-haired woman from Being John Malkovich. Remember? Not Cameron Diaz, but the other one. The first thing I said to her was "Have you ever noticed that when Puff Daddy drinks champagne, everyone drinks champagne?" And she replied, "And when Puff Daddy lies down, everyone lies down?" We didn't make out like the others, but we made a connection. We ended up talking very close for the rest of the night. As the party broke up in the morning, we were on our separate ways. I almost forgot to ask her for her number, but she said she'd see me at the Today Show the next morning so we'd just meet up then. Walking back to my New York City apartment that morning, I thought two things: one, I should have gotten her number anyway, and two, I was SURE she had once slept over in my dorm freshman year. No, wait, she was just there really late one night after a group outing. She must've not remembered it herself.   The night before I had this dream, I dreamt that I was walking past a group of armed soldiers, as a civilian, probably in an occupied zone. In either case I had no animosity towards them. One soldier, by mistake, shot me. The rest of the dream, I was trying verbally agitate her about the shooting; trying to make her feel sorry her gun was pointed at me--and not upwards like it was supposed to--when it went off by accident. The wound never actually hurt, but she never apologized, either.  Now what's all that supposed to mean?

      Album: Bjork: Selmasongs  I work with a group of students from the Czech Republic. Though I do not converse with them often, I have learned some of their views on American culture and politics. Most I already knew, but it was nice to hear them come from the mouths of actual foriegners.  1.) Everyone in America must have a car to survive. Everything is so far apart, it would be impossible to exist without one.  2.) Cars, however, are very inexpensive, and almost anyone can afford one. Gas is extremely cheap and the driver's tests are short and uncomplicated (Czechs must test for several hours with a uniformed policeman in the car).  3.) Public transportation in America is absolute crap. New York City is an exception.  4.) Everything is bigger here. Portions of food, lawns, suburban sprawl, roads, people. There is a lot of room.  5.) There are more abandoned buildings, unmowed lawns, and litter here.  6.) George W. Bush is unpopular for a number of reasons. One is his idea of an "Axis of Evil" for terrorism that requires military force as a solution. Another is the Kyoto Treaty, though its failure to be signed is the fault of the entire U.S. Government. The most popular presidents to Europeans are probably Woodrow Wilson and John F. Kennedy, because of their links to European history.  7.) It's a long plane trip.  8.) Nomatter what part of the earth you're from, if you're going to the States you'll travel to Florida at least once. And if you're in Upstate New York, you'll be at Niagara Falls within a week.  9.) The United States does not agree with other countries in world affairs because it is either A) stubborn, B) doesn't know better, or C) doesn't like other countries telling it what to do. It's usually C.  10.) The French are assholes.

       Album: Soundtrack, Blues Brothers 2000  Day two and I already have writer's block.  I have tried in several other occations to write in a conventional diary. I have also attemped a poetry book which is still stagnantly awaiting a Page 5, and just the thought of what horrible wordplay I may have used in it two years ago makes me cringe. The basic idea, however, hasn't died yet. It would be nice to have SOME record of myself, even if reasons for it are few or trite. The only successes I've had in this department are for interpersonal communication, not personal introspection. For example, I save all personal IMs and E-mails. Do I look at them all later? No, and I do not share them with anyone outside of the person I originally communicate with. And I've tried my hand at photography, which is okay, but the sole purpose of that is to eventually show the pictures to somebody else. Apparently, just filling a journal with my thoughts and feelings is worthless to me. Is it because I measure their importance with a comparative societal scale? Anyway, all I know is that there is a Chance that someone will read this, and that is good enough for my efforts. Oftentimes when I am having an IM or E-mail conversation I am thinking to myself whether I will be ashamed of what I say if I read it again years from now. I especially wonder how other people will characterize me if they read "this" in the future. Someone is always watching me, even if it is only me. Better to keep my mouth shut, then.

      CD now playing: Tori Amos, "Strange Little Girls"  Finally, a first foray into a fake form of a weblog.  So last week I was in the newly built Newstead Public Library when I spotted Natalie Imbruglia's first album in the record bin. "Why not" I thought, because they're free... I have spent the entire week relistening to this album, and have only yesterday pried myself off it to save my sanity... Why do I listen to it so much? Its slyly subtle vocal deliveries? The quality of the studio musicians? Or the critical hunt for and appreciation of all its minor flaws? (They are many more I hope to find.) Nomatter. Three days ago, however, I was watching TV, trying to escape my fixation on Imbruglia's song "One More Addiction" when who else but the singer herself pops up on one of those hair coloring ads. You know, the ones with Beyonce Knowles or that Dark Angel girl? I was shocked. No, horrified. It's like those horror movies where the character finally believes their own reassurances that the house is not haunted, and then opens a closet door to see the ghost staring her right in the face. How did Natalie know?! Chilling. Later that night, a mildly familiar, comfortable nightmare. I walk down a hallway to find a room: 10,000 people at a Natalie Imbruglia concert, I find myself front row center. This is normal, and I am afraid.

      CD: Count Basie, "Ken Burns Jazz: The Definitive Count Basie"  My brother came up to me the other night and said, "Hey, I got this great new excersize. You want to know what it is?" Um, I guess? "Just do this." He squats on his knees, then stands back up, then repeats. That's all? "That's all you need, dude! Just do like a bunch of them" Oh. "After a while it gets really, really hard to do. And you can feel it working." What about jogging or biking? "Dude, this is all you need. Just do like 50 of 'em and you're all set for the day." Well then. I guess I'm sold. I didn't leave the recliner, but I considered trying a couple, for a few seconds. I was busy reading. No time for anything right now...besides it was too hot out. My brother said he was late and his ride came to pick him up. Thus endeth this week's conversation with my brother.

      CD: Van Halen, "Van Halen"  My dad was watching MTV Undressed again. I long time ago I might have tried scolding him. Usually I would just repeatedly ask him what else was on. If I was in the next room, I would tell him to turn it down at the very least. He's too old now and so am I. (Though they still check my ID at in Canada, what's up with that?) People that old (as old as him, that is) CAN learn to tricks, but they don't WANT to. So forget it. My dad comes home at night, watches TV for a few hours, and goes to sleep. That's it for him, maybe for the rest of his days. The only thing I can really do is resist that kind of entropy for the next 60 or so years. Wish me luck, dude. I've already been online for an hour now.

      CD: They Might Be Giants, "Apollo 18"  I got me a new toothbrush. It was time. The old toothbrush's surface looked like a national park after a forest fire. The dentist told me I should use soft bristles, because apparently I have tender gums, or something like that. I really can't remember because I haven't seen my dentist in five years. But I was raised with a Protestant work ethic, so when it comes to fighting cavities a little pain and bleeding is par for the course. Did you know that there are no "hard" toothbrushes at the drugstore? Only "soft" and "medium"? Well, the mediums work just fine, thank you very much. And my teeth feel great, the bristles feel hard, and the inside of my mouth feels refreshingly raw. I'm not being sarcastic! It actually seems like I'm making progress, George W. Bush Administration-style, on the War Against Tooth Decay. And though I haven't seen a whole lotta progress yet, I'm sure that with a larger annual budget I'm going to be just fine. Now if I can just get myself to floss regularly...

      CD: various, "Ultra-Lounge 4: Bachelor Pad Royale"  Well you got your Leninist-Marxists and you got your Socialists and you got your Leftests and you got your Greens and you got your Moderate Liberals and then you got your Reactionary Democrats. And they all publish at least one paper that comes out here in Buffalo. And I might actually throw my support to some of these people were not their banter so redundant, trite, and prejudiciously partisanin terms of their treatment of the conservatives and the Republicans. I mean, really, none of these papers are actually saying anything different from one another, yet you have half a dozen papers telling me that Al Gore should have won the election. Back when I was impressionable, I skimmed my father's "Solidarity" magazine, which he got in the mail for being in the UAW. And even when I was 10 and couldn't tell the difference between Democrat, Republican, VHS, or Beta, I could tell that information was skewed to far to be trusted. In comparison it took me two more years to get the same feelings for Rush Limbaugh. If the conservatives wrote as many papers as these guys did I say the same stuff, but at least those guys aren't wasting my time like with the public propoganda of People's World Weekly.

      CD: various, "That Virtua Feeling: Sega and Sub Pop Get Together"  It has become my goal in life to drive my bought-new 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier into the ground. Oh yes, it will be done. When bought, I told my insurance company it would be driven about 10,000 miles a year. Pretty generous, seeing that beforehand I was driving about 3000 miles a year--just to work and back, mostly. But with a new car--a car that won't have to be in the shop every other week--my driving urges became more ferocious. Now there are over 20,000 miles on my car, in only the first 16 months. I am also planning on driving to Toronto, Pittsburgh, and Nashville within the coming weeks. Which reminds me, I better get my oil changed. And my tires rotated! Hell, I drove 150 miles today and I can't even remember where I went. Well, better get to bed, I've got a long drive tomorrow as well.

      CD: Sonic Youth, "Washing Machine"  So I ran a red light. At two in the morning, in a small village, two blocks from where I was going to drop someone off. I am not upset, or feeling it's somehow unfair. I did a ton of other things in that car that day that could have gotten me in worse trouble. (Everyone says I'm a bad driver.) It is a bit ironic that my first recorded traffic infraction occurred when I was doing one of the least dangerous things possible--not stopping at a quite visibly empty, small-town intersection--but nevertheless I will change my ways. In terms of karma, this ticket was well-deserved. Too many times have I just missed a yellow light (a notorious signature of Buffalo drivers), or used an exit at the last second. And when I went in for a defensive driving course, once the guy just gave me the insurance reduction for free because no one else showed up. This has been a long time coming. I am a new man! Pretty much. I did the speed limit all the way home!

      CD: Ozomatli, "Ozomatli"  Chore night. After several days of who-knows-what (schoolwork, traveling, etc.) that keeps a person away from basic maintenance, I can take that extra hour to concentrate on the smaller details of life. Like folding some of that laundry I didn't get to finish. Maybe reading some of that already mail I picked up yesterday. Organizing my CD collection back into their cases. Emptying out my "To Be Filed" folder (when it's the biggest folder in the cabinet, time to start sorting). Normally I'm pretty neat (and tidy, too  ) so it's odd and somewhat disconcerting to see these three or four things out of place. I'm such a disappointment. Tisk tisk. Which reminds me, I've got some letters to send out!

      CD: Shel Silverstein #3 (homemade compilation)  I was at a show yesterday that tried really really really to cater to the Extreme part of society. You know, the snowboarding/BMX/Do the Dew kind of people created by Madison Avenue. Everyone had a pretty good time, but some of it was kind of forced upon us. Stop asking us if we're having a good time! And while we're at it, you can only say "I can't HEAR you!" so many times.   But like I said, it was still a good show. The Extreme people got to see their favorite Extreme sports, the new rockers got to see some decent bands, and the moshers got some action in, too. Preferably, I like the mosh pit far away from myself, so I try to stay somewhere on the side or farther back in the middle. Yesterday, a Second Mosh Pit started behind me as well, creating a Mosh Sandwich. In the center of the sandwich was a two year old kid, who was held by a father that carried the boy in the left hand and kept the crowdsurfers at bay with the right. Nothing happened, but why? Why would you take a two year old child to an environment of adult substances and loud adult language, and then take them to a crowded area next to people that are literally trying to punch each other in the face? Well, I don't have all the answers. Maybe they couldn't find a babysitter that night.

      CD: Primus, "The Brown Album"  I've got 3 minutes to write an entry! What to say what to say! Gotta go watch my favorite show. Then I gotta do some laundry. Then I gotta work on a research paper. Then I gotta get some sleep! It's already 12:30 in the morning! Why don't I do these things during the day? Oh well. Always something to watch or somewhere to go instead. Always another errand to run that could wait until tomorrow but probably shouldn't. Always have to get up and use the bathroom or get a snack or some water. Hey, I could go for some water right now. Awful hot day, it was. Water would be nice. Hey, one minute left! I'll spend it going to the kitchen sink.

      CD: Soundgarden, "Down On the Upside"  I ran out of space to put my CDs...again. I am also way behind on cataloging; I can only estimate that I have about 800 CDs right now. Yes, the CD burner has help, as well as the Napster standbys. But I just bought 4 CDs in Toronto the other day and I know I'm going back in a couple weeks to find some more. Sick, sick, sick. In the same vein, today I tried catching up on my periodicals reading, as I have a stack of about 2 weeks worth of newspapers and other assorted rags I haven't plowed through yet. I'm almost done with that task. (A lot of those rags concern music and, vicariously, new CD reviews.) Today I thought to myself that if I lived in any other generation I would have never even considered the concept that there was too much information to digest. But I went to 20 other websites before I started this entry, just because I had stuff I wanted to look up. Have you ever thought to yourself, "I have to stop reading, turn of the radio and TV, and do something completely monotonous to reset my mind"? Are we lucky for this? Sometime I should write about how much of this information is actually informative. Gee, listen to me, I just finished listening to Radiohead and this is what happens. I have to go fold some laundry now; until tomorrow.

       CD: various, "Just Say Roe"  Today I got an E-mail from myself, telling me I may win a Super Summer Holiday Vacation Thingy if I fill out the appropriate information at some alphanumerically named website. It was from an old TomServo0 I used to use in my college days and had lost the password. Whoever took it over and sent out the mail should have considered, possibly, to not E-mail another address of the guy's that he took. Don't you think? Then I wouldn't have to find out about it and shut him down. The same thing apparently happened to one of my father's addresses and when we found out and checked, there were 999 E-mails in his outbox. In conclusion, it was nice that someone actually sent me an E-mail, even if it was from myself. It made my day so much I even wrote this little letter about it. Yay! Now to Chuck for the weather.

What's she up to now? No kidding! Oh, yeah I'm still in school. Oh, I study education at Buffalo State now. I'll probably do that for year and then get a job. What are you doing now? That's cool. Really? Since when? That's great. Man, you're on your way. Yeah, he's still around, I talked to him a couple of days ago. Did you know he moved? No, he likes it a lot there. He'll be in the area in a few weeks. Hehe, that's just like the time.... I know, I know. It just costs so much now. So what are you doing this weekend? Neither am I. We should do something. I dunno. We always have this problem! Hey, that's an idea. Who else would want to go? Hmm. Dude, yeah! Call him up. That would be cool. Okay, and I'll call.... Yeah but then I'll call you at seven after I call her. Something like that. Cool, it's a plan. Should we do something else afterwards? Yeah, we'll see. This could be cool. Oh, okay. Well I'll call you then. Yeah, good to see you again! Crazy coincidence.... Uh huh. Yeah, hehe. Okay, I'll see you later!

      CD: Rufus Wainwright, "Poses"  I've been working on my lack of a diet. No, actually I've just been thinking about it. I'm not the healthiest person in the world, but I am not fat either; nevertheless I concern myself with what I eat. This is mostly because what I eat is a whole pile of crap. Ramen noodles. Chocolate brownies. Several bowls of Corn Flakes. Or is it what I DON'T eat? An ample number of fruits? A steady intake of fiber? My problem is that I might eat one meal during the day, and then, right before I go to bed, I say "Well, you can eat a little something before bed, you are a bit malnourished right now." Bam, half a casserole is downed. I really gotta work on those portions. No wait, take off the "s" of the last word in that sentence. And no more brownies for breakfast, either...

      CD: CMJ New Music Monthly, March 2001  It rained today! But not too much that we had clear skies tomorrow. That means there could be rain tomorrow! Not too shabby. I like sunny days--I've been working on my farmer's tan--but the heat is so oppressive that I don't know what to do with myself. Lately it means I fall asleep after doing something extremely physical, like getting the mail or eating a sandwich. Another problem with summer weather is that it's not spring or fall, when it's comfortable to do any outside exercise. Autumn is good because you can get just enough of a workout to get a sweat and still warm yourself up. It evens out! But in the summertime you fry (I'm peeling skin off right now) and melt at the same time. If you're in an empty wading pool at the time you can simmer in your own juices. Even if that happened, it'd be to hot to eat yourself! Rain, rain, come again, you my very bestest friend...

       CD: various, burned 4/20/00  I was just watching TV Land when they played one of those Classic Commercials. Remember the old Wendy's ad where they're at a Soviet fashion show, and the Eveningwear, Sleepwear, and Swimwear are the same outfit? That's a good one. The music makes it. What good commercials are out there today? I remember the Super Bowl ad for E*Trade with the cymbal-playing monkey. Or something like that. Either way, they made a point of how they wasted $2 million on the ad, but they can show you how to invest your money smartly. Funny monkey! The Chili's ads for Baby Back Ribs were good, but only the first one. The rest were pretty redundant. Then they added N*Sync (what's with the asterisks?) where Chili's totally sold out. I like the Little Caesar's ad with the kid trying to release the Free Crazy Bread back into the wild. ("You're free, crazy bread, go go go!") The Blockbuster video game ads are good. Like the one guy that didn't stop playing games for days and started to smell bad? Then the store manager walks by and sniffs him and keels over, and then the one worker goes "Yes, we're closing early!" But I digress.

      CD: Black Label Society, "Sonic Brew" (It beats saying Natalie Imbruglia again, doesn't it?)  Maybe I don't want to look for a job. Maybe I don't want a lucrative career. Maybe I don't want to get a more expensive education. Maybe I only watch auto races for the crashes. Maybe some of the things I do are illegal and I don't care. Maybe I'm not a patriot. Maybe I'm not a capitalist. Maybe I have serious emotional problems. Maybe you're right after all. Maybe I should have admitted that sooner. Maybe I should be asleep right now. Maybe I don't work hard enough to earn what I make. Maybe I will always be a corporate tool. Maybe jingoism is an admirable quality. Maybe I should work more on my posture. Maybe everyone's a racist. Maybe I'm the most racist person I've met. Maybe things are better now. Maybe the world is digging a hole instead of building a tower. Maybe this weblog is a bad idea. Maybe someone will read this post and adversely affect my life because of it. Maybe intelligence makes you synical. Maybe I'm a compete idiot.

      CD: Spacehog, "The Hoggysey"  The worst procrastination happens now, when your eyes start to get tired and you say to yourself "I should really get some sleep. That's the most important thing. I can just get up earlier in the morning..." It almost always never works. The snooze alarm is the most diabolical invention known to mankind, even more destructive than the atomic bomb....And so again I succumb to its powers. Tonight I will rest--only for a little while, I pray--with the alarm clock far away from my bed. I will remove it from arms' length in order to fulfill the promises made to my weakened constitution. Victory may still be ours in our time.   On a similar note, if another job application asks me about my Philosophy of Education one more time, I might FIND my temper...

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "White Lilies Island"  (Yes, again. I know I have a problem.)  Swearing is fun, but it wears out its welcome quickly. It also sounds somewhat grating to others and should never be spoken around children. (Though I doubt that if we did that unrestricted that children's minds would be adversely affected.) The funnest of all is making up your own curse words! Here is a short list of some of the ones I use.  Shiznit! Frickin' A! Jiminy Cricket! Jim Crow! Sunnuva! Nizzuts! Bloody 'eck! Well I'll be dipped in peanut butter sauce! (Thanks Wayne) Tang! Hooey! Sheepskin! W! Frenchy McFrench!  And since I'm too busy listening to Natalie Imbruglia to remember the rest of them, I'll make a few new ones up:  Shibby! (Thanks Steve) Urge to kill rising! (Thanks Jim) Fang! Egrecks! Peter Frampton! Stu-stu-studio! Gingerbread! (Thanks Dave) McFly! Fran-CIS! Effing Tower!  See? It's fun AND easy. Try it today!

      CD: Drain S.T.H., "Horror Wrestling"  When you think of America, what comes to mind? I was talking with someone from the Czech Republic today about July 4th. I mentioned some of the little facts I knew, like the Declaration of Independence was signed before July 4th, so Independence Day really isn't Independence Day. (Actually, since the Treaty of Paris acknowledging America's independence wasn't signed until 1783....Anyway.) She knew about the Boston Tea Party, but because of her accent I thought she said the cause of it was "Texas." After figuring it out I added that the "Texas" Americans had to pay were the lowest in the British Empire, and therefore probably the world. So sometimes when I think about America, I think it is a nation of whiny brats who like to eat. But on a more positive note, America is, well, so UN-American. On the 4th of July we sing our national anthem (British, look it up), drink beer (German), light firecrackers (Chinese) and celebrate our system of government (Roman, Greek, British, Iroquois, French, etc.) and our independence from foreign oppression (?) All of this country used to be owned by Natives, and we either got it from them or the British, French, Spanish, Dutch, Mexicans, Russians, Canadians, Hawaiians, or countless other people, usually by force or unfair land dealings. The Statue of Liberty was built in France. New York City is the home of the United Nations. And on and on. So if anything, be thankful that we are a nation of people from around the world who have worked harder than anyone to deserve the right to become whiny brats who like to eat. And if America=the world, God bless Americans.

       CD: Stone Temple Pilots, "No. 4"  Jeff is drunk. Sometimes drunk can be funny, like Otis. But sometimes it can be annoying, or disgusting, or even scary. On the internet, however, it's only funny! Jeff just can't spell, that's all. Like this example:  (12:49:23 AM): we hvae to git tehere earliy (12:49:28 AM): it is bizzy (12:49:35 AM): 10 but bixzy (12:49:42 AM): earli!! qw git htere (12:49:48 AM): poops - sorryyy (12:49:58 AM): pskkrf (12:50:05 AM): pakked (12:50:14 AM): bizzy!  THAT is comedy. The best part is that they can't see you laughing at everything they say, and you can make it look as if you're taking all their statements with absolute seriousness. My favorite part is when they just start apologizing for things: for being a bad friend, for being drunk, for something that may or may not have happened two months before. Jeff's not doing that now, but if he were this would be SO much cooler.   On a lighter note, I hope the terrorists aren't attacking us today, because July 4th is a great symbol of our independence but it also means 42% of our nation is drunk at any given time. Then again, the rest of us are either in uniform or armed with firecrackers and guns--even the kids--so I guess we'll be alright. So as the 9th District Court says, ___ Bless America and goodnight...  (12:45:30 AM): gte wrodl is psinning rihgt onw1

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "White Lilies Island"  Currently trying to beat the heat. Fans are an obvious tool, but they are noisy and they blow in your face, causing one to feel even more tired than before. Air conditioning is even better, but for those of us who don't have air conditioning, piggybacking is required. Go to a restaurant instead of cooking. See a movie at the theater instead of watching television. Visit the public library instead of reading your mail/newspaper/books at home. But the best way to fend off the high temperatures? Ice cream. Oh yes. Half gallons on sale for $2.99 today; stock up and ride it out. Only 60 days until Labor Day...

      CD: New Order, "Substance"  Three different factors can factors can create a feeling of fatigue. One of them is excessive heat, which slows the body down as it tries to cool off when it is 90+ degrees outside. A second is a lack of sleep, which can happen when one procrastinates on their grad school assignments resulting in two poor hours of sleep. [Please see previous post.] A third symptom is overeating, like when someone's personal "Finish It Off" diet plan requires that someone eat the last half of their mother's goulash casserole (yes, such a thing exists). All three of these factors met today for the first time at 2:30 PM EST in Western New York, where the author of this post remained completely incapacitated for much of the rest of the day. Scarily, the victim assesses that these same factors may again rejoin for a second deadly assault in about one hour. We'll keep you up-to-date with information as we get it.

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Talking Book"  At my school, the age of the average student is 26, meaning that in most cases they have better things to do than sit around in a classroom. They usually want to retrain or get some sort of certification or are there for the fun of it, which I have seen but still don't believe. The school attempts to accomodate all of these things, but for anyone trying to get an education straight through will find a crooked path. In one of my classes, "Mentoring Seminar," the idea is that each student already has a job in our career and is working with someone with experience at the workplace to be their "mentor." This is true of 5 out of 12 students in the class, meaning the other 7, and the teacher, have no idea what to do next. And, of course, this prerequisite wasn't mentioned to anyone beforehand. If she drops the students (like myself) that don't meet the supposed "prerequisites," she has to cancel the class, which she can't do. And I need my gull durned credits! This will be an interesting month.

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Music of My Mind"  After haggling with a workable student schedule, and then submitting FIVE different versions of it to the Registrar's Office, then petitioning a professor to add me to her class, only to fail to fail in that attempt, I will be taking nine credit hours this semester. Luckily, I took a class in the summer, keeping me on track with a full-time courseload. One class I was especially happy to get into was abbreviated in the class listing as "CRIT ISS MUS STU". "Cool," I thought, "Critical Issues in Muslim Studies! This is perfect considering the state of the world. I could really get into this one." While buying the books I noticed they seemed to discuss art and other strange topics not directly involving politics. "Cool," I thought, "They're going to look at this from a completely different angle: a cultural standpoint and our interpretations of that standpoint." Then I get into class, and ignore what was written on the board until one minute before class starts: "Critical Issues in Museum Studies". Doh! Well, it meets my requirement so I'm staying. Jiminy.

      CD: Soundgarden, "Flower" EP  I got an E-mail forwarded to me that was supposed to be some sort of "Proud to be an American" statement but instead ended up being a rant in the vein of nativist jingoism. It starts by saying the author was upset a Florida judge allowed a Moslem woman to get her driver's license photo taken with only her eyes showing. Poor us, this is competely against our American ideals! Why, if this woman wants to be in OUR country, that's fine, but she should conform to OUR moral values and OUR way of life. This person, who may have left her country of origin to escape religious persecution, should assimilate with the culture she moved to, not impose her exclusive culture on those she meets here! That's just plain un-American! So have you ever been so infuriated by someone's comments you didn't know what to say first? I deleted the E-mail.

      CD: Weezer, "Maladroit"  This fall I will either sleep until noon every day and do homework out of sheer boredom, or I will get up at 5 every morning and fall asleep at the wheel driving back from college late some night. I have signed up to be a substitute teacher in three different schools, and if they call me I become a rich but very busy man. One thing I didn't know about substitute teaching is that in some schools, you don't even need a bachelor's degree--or have taken education courses in college, for that matter--to work. Fifty bucks for six hours of work is not really much to scoff at, considering you could be cleaning toilets for about as much instead. But that's with a union toilet-scrubbing job. Then again it would be cheaper to scrub the toilets and not have to pay for decent dress clothes and ties you'd have to wear every day of the week. Of course, you go to work simply to afford things like decent dress clothes and ties. Well maybe not ties; I was never a big fan of them. I have gotten used to them, however, which is good, and nowadays I don't have to go online and ask Jeeves "How do you tie a tie?" anymore. I keep the link in my Favorites menu anyway, just for sentimental value, I guess. In fact, when was the last time I cleaned out my Favorites? November 9, 2001. Now I know. Knowing is half the battle. Knowledge is power. The power is in your hands. You're in good hands with AllState. Quaker State motor oil gives your engine protection beyond 3000 miles. I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more. More selection means better savings. Wider is better. You should know better. Knowing is half the battle...

      CD: Vertical Horizon, "Everything You Want"  Recently I've become addicted to a television show, which is horrible because 1) I really don't have the time and 2) the show is ninety minutes long. It's called The Screen Savers and is on the TechTV channel, oh, about five times a day. The premise is simple: a bunch of people talking about a new computer gadgets, taking help calls from viewers, and interviewing other people who apparently know what they're talking about when it comes to computers. It fascinates me because I'm interested in the half of the show I understand and I wish I could understand the other half of the show I don't. The best part is when something called "The Screen Savers Effect" happens on the show, which is when someone tries to demonstrate a new application or website and the thing just refuses to work. Dude, that totally like happens to ME all the time! So now I have to learn how to read textbooks and newspapers and watch television at the same time. At least the show is educational in that regard...

      CD: Bikini Kill, "Pussywhipped"  This summer my subconcious has almost taken over. It's fascinating and scary at the same time. I think it started during my many ours alone in the car, singing to myself and cursing me out whenever I'm just about to merge into heavy traffic. Recently, these verbalizations have found me on the sidewalk, at work, or while watching television. Usually they consist of only one or two words--if that--but they can border on Tourette's every once in the while. This only happens when I am alone in a place, so it is nothing like the truly crazy people you see talking to themselves along a New York City street. But why am I doing them? Why were I not prior? Will it make me "CRAAAAAYZEEEE?" It's like mumbling incoherent things in your sleep, but instead I'm awake at the same time. I hope it's not chronic schizophrenia; that would be a demon hell ride, making me laugh like a crazy clown in the Bozo circus . . . .

      CD: Memphis Minnie, "Queen of the Blues"  In a recent post I mentioned my cat, Billy, and his addiction to marijuana. Which brings me back to the post I wrote the other night, about going to the Tool concert. The opening band was Tomahawk, some sort of new collaboration with a member from Faith No More, another guy from Jesus Lizard, etc. And I'm sure they sounded great. This would have been a verifiable statement, had not my brother and sister (A family outing!) gone with me to make it by the 7:30 start time, instead of leaving the house at 8:00. Why so late? The two music lovers wanted to Smoke Up before they left.   Which brings me back to my cat, Billy, and his addiction to marijuana. About 4 years ago I came home and found an open box marked "Cat High" in large, cursive marker. "What's this?" I asked my brother, inquisitively.  "Heh heh hehhhhhhhh . . . .  Nothin!"  I assumed the label on the box was literal, and later found out I was right. During parties with friends, sometimes my brother would light up a bowl of weed, put a box over it, and put the cat in the box for a few minutes. I hear that during one hilarious episode the cat started walking all crooked (they don't always land on their feet!), leaning against the wall, and then ralphed in a corner. This would explain why the cat meows after it's let out, not before, why its skinny and and always has the munchies, and why its eyes are, well, glassy. Like a smoked glass? Anyway the statute of limitations is probably already out for giving hash to the cat, and since there's no moral/happy ending to the story . . . uh, I forgot.

We were down in Orlando last spring . . . . Anyway we all got salmonella and Rob got it BAD. Like he was shakin' and stuff, and shitting blood and everything, right? So one night we're getting back real late to the motel and Rob like can't make it . . . . And he just gets down and takes a SHIT, right there on the boardwalk! It was the fuckin' funniest thing I've ever seen! Hah ha ha . . . !   I don't have anything to add to this, except: if your cousin is so sick he has to deficate blood on the street, is it really funny? Oh well. But I feel bad for the people making out under the boardwalk . . .

      CD: Pearl Jam, "Binaural"  At one point at work last week I was looking for a cardboard box full of paper bags. I never found it. I looked in the storage room, but to no avail. After asking a manager where they were, he said "try the next room, where they keep the stuff for the gift shop." If there is an overflow of stock, as there usually is during the peak summer months, my work is able to use the other store's storage space. To make a short story shorter, I did not know what the box of bags actually looked like, so I had to pry open a few of the packages. After about 10 minutes of searching a cramped little storage room--one you can't walk in and should be able to find things without actually looking--I got frustrated, tore a slit in the top of an unmarked box and stuck my hand in. What was inside shocked me. It sure wasn't paper bags, but soft. And furry. And at the same time, a co-worker unknowingly from behind their sneakers squeaking.   Fur + Squeak  = Alive!   I pulled my hand back and went "AAAAAAHH!"   "What's wrong?" the co-worker asked. "I thought it was alive! And I got scared! Geez!" I tried to breathe. She looked at the plain cardboard box, then me. "Oh Kayyy..." and resumed walking.  I wish the gift shop would label their crates of stuffed animals, but I'm in no position to dictate.

      CD: Medeski Martin & Wood, "Uninvisible"  There are primal instincts that all mankind must succumb to at one time or another. Perhaps it is the drive to perpetuate the species, or increase heartrate when threatened. Today, without thinking, I tried to protect my nads from getting stepped on by my cat. For whatever reason, I have a cat that loves stepping on my nads. I could be reading the newspaper, or sitting and eating, or lying down asleep. This cat (whose name is Billy, after Billy Corgan [not my decision] by the way) will somehow find an excuse to jump up to my lap area and then wander around. This results in a repeated number of passes over my reproductive organs whilst walking very, very deliberately. Then, after about the third pass, the cat starts pawing at the rocky "ground" as if attempting to achieve better footing. This will involve claws, but they are not very sharp or heavily utilized. I still fail to understand why the cat will walk on my nads but not my legs, shoulders, or torso when they are available to him. Always--without fail--straight for the nads.   Today I was lying down, and on my side. Therefore, there was no logically feasible way the cat COULD step on my nads, even if it WANTED to. But when the cat jumped on to the sofa, and near my waist, I instantly hinged my body so my knees ended up almost against my chest. I was awed by my sense of reflex, and then by my stupidity. More about Billy the Cat later, as he is the only cat I know of who is a recovering marijuana addict; like it sounds, it's a long story.

      CD: moe., "dither"  Once again, I have missed the Fair. The Erie County Fair ("second largest county fair in America!" the brochure exclaims) was held from August 8 to August 18, and guess what day it is. I have only been to the Fair one time, and that's when I was about 8 years old. There was a really big sandcastle, and a bunch of tractors, and ice cream, and funhouse mirrors and it smelled like poo and feed! We had a really fun time. Ever since then I've wanted to go back but NO, I've been out of town or working or couldn't find anyone to go with me or it was raining or some other silly reason. Alas, one more year of waiting before I see a demolition derby, or get reminded as to what all the H's stand for in 4H, or walk by a cheap excuse for a Ferris Wheel and think "I don't wanna waste my tickets on that, either." Phooey!

      CD: Blue Oyster Cult, "Secret Treaties"  George W. Bush is an excellent puppet president. Thirty years from now, or however long it is supposed to take, I'm sure the documents will be released to show that Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld and the like were running the whole show. But is that a bad thing? I mean really. In a time where we have to deal with Middle East peace problems and threats of oil embargos, broken agreements between Israel and Palestine, and the Saudi Arabian question, who else is better equipped to lead than people who not only have experience in the area, but have actually fought a war there and won? So we know that something will get done. What we don't know is how many people will get killed, civilian or otherwise, in the Arabian subcontinent as a result of some old American codgers wishing they had done it right the first time and gone General Sherman on Saddam's regime. And thirty years from now, to look back and say this country was so powerful it would pick fights with any poor, dysfunctional kid on the playground isn't going to get us anything but dirty looks at the P.T.A. meetings. I do not fear any problems with the U.S.'s economy, infrastructure, or public security under the Second Bush Administration, but I do believe America is trying to clean the loaded gun we leave around the house. Think about the children!

      CD: various, "Hopeless Records Winter/Spring 2002 Sampler"  The public library down the street is where I should be spending more of my time. Why I am not probably includes Television in its equation, something that says a lot about my recent bouts with sloth in these summer months. The new library has free, high-speed internet access. My house will not let me get past 33.6. The new library has air conditioning. My house has ten fans that can't get the temperature under 80. The new library gets Rolling Stone and has comfortable chairs. My house? The UAW newsletter and a couch with my father in his underwear. The new library is a two minute walk from Chinese take-out dishes. My house is a Petri dish for flies to feast on. I hope someday to become such an influential citizen of a town that they name a room of their local library in my honor, which I can move into permanently. Until then, I'll have to remember due dates and sweat in my spare time.

      CD: MP3 CD, cont'd (current track: Sex Pistols, "Anarchy in the U.K.")  Today I planned on going to Lackawanna for an optional job interview, optional because it was for an entry level job, nobody called me, and the only notice I had for it said anyone "interested" in the job "may" come by. It was supposed to be from 9 AM to noon.   What follows is the remarkable story of one person's ineptitude, ignorance, and bad luck. Firstly, I got 2 1/2 hours of sleep the night before. That is bad for an interview. It is also bad for anyone that has to wake up early, because it disables the Willingness to Wake part of the brain at seven in the morning. So after being late leaving town, It was time to find this Oz, this Mecca, this District Administration Building. 30 Johnson Street. And for the first time in my history of using Yahoo! maps (why the exclamation?) it was completely and utterly and unknowingly incorrect. Not only did it take me to James Street, not Johnson Street, but James Street is about 50 yards long with no buildings, at least none that weren't empty. I found out quickly that Lackawanna has three types of homes: housing projects, housing projects that try to look like real houses, and real houses that look like housing projects trying to look like real houses. Driving around in a tie, listening to Natalie Imbruglia, was like Mr. Dreysdale coming to visit. Luckily I had several sets of maps with me because I have a history of getting lost even a mile from my home. Also, it's not that I don't want to ask for directions, it's that I hate people. Anyway, after driving past it twice I did find 30 Johnson Street, and after two more passes I found the parking lot. The building was grey like the rest of the town, but it was also very dark inside. Too many thoughts passed through my conscience. It took me an hour to get here even without getting lost, would I want to drive an hour to work every day? I'm too tired for a good interview. I don't need an interview anyway; they've already sent me the tax forms. I'm half an hour late and it would be an embarassment to everyone involved. I don't WANT to go in. Is anyone even here? Eventually I reached the conclusion that the job was worth trying for, but it wasn't worth going in for the interview.   For the life of me I will never, ever understand why that last sentence makes sense to me. I never got out of the car. I drove off to do other errands instead. Quickly I found that I was five blocks from my friend Dave's house in Blasdell, eight blocks from where I was caught running a red light last month, and ten blocks from where I paid $120 in parking tickets as a plea bargain for that red light just one week ago. Ineptitude, ignorance, and bad luck. Today all of these things came full circle.

      CD: MP3s CD (current track: Blues Brothers, "Soul Man")  The other weekend I was at home at night with my parents. But let's not dwell on that. Anyway, at 11:30 my mother says "Hey, isn't Saturday Night Live on?"   She really wanted to watch it! As if she was always watching it. I thought she hadn't seen the show since John Belushi was alive. When was Mom interested in pop culture? Now I find out that she's a big Chris Farley fan, as well as Will Farrell. These were the same people and skits that were a "bad influence" on me years ago, and "Why are you staying up so late when church is tomorrow?" Now it's because my parents wanted to stay up late and not let us know they were laughing at it. To the casual observer, someone would think I am exposing my past ignorance by saying this. Instead, it only proves one of my earliest hypotheses: they are NOT having sex behind closed doors. EVER.

      CD: my CD of MP3s (current song: Ani DiFranco "In or Out (live)"  Why Fred? I still don't understand why my parents thought it was the 1979 thing to do to name me Fred, not Jimmy or Ayatollah or Fonz or whatever name was actually popular back then. Fred is a family name from my mother's side; I have a deceased great-grandfather and an uncle with that name. Nevertheless, it would be nice to know other Fred People. I meet maybe one every other year, not that I'm looking hard. Usually they're wearing nametags, like mechanics or delivery men. I'm not so good with my hands, but I play some piano. Hmm, Frederic Chopin played piano. But still! I would have never met him. And my parents, who listen to things like Ringo Starr's solo work and that "Courtesy of the Red White and Blue" song weren't exactly thinking along the lines of anything French. Ugh, the French.  I'm not staying on point. The point is--and I do have one--Fred is a horrible name for the new millenium. It has actually became more popular in the last decade, up to about 400th on the Most Popular Boys' Names list. 400th! My brother's name, Tim, is in the 20s, while my sister, Hannah, is nearing the top 10. To use webspeak, WTF? I was gipped. I could have been a Carl or a Tom or William, or something whacked-out-but-cool like Dakota, Dolemite or Velvet, but NO. Name me after some average Canadian guy from 1868. I'm going to go cry myself to sleep now.  No I won't. Freds don't cry. Unless they drop a hammer on their foot.

      CD: CMJ New Music Monthly, Vol. 88, December 2000  My CD collection is Important Business. Not that the CDs are very good, or that I've spent a great deal on them. But I listen to a lot of music, and when it comes to recordkeeping I'm Rain Man. My 753 CDs are now enjoying their new home in a plastic shelving system recently bought from OfficeMax. (Except the 200 that wouldn't fit.)  Some foreign coworkers have asked me to put together an MP3 CD for them, and being the great American Music Lover I am, I've decided to go all out. Two hundred songs from 200 artists. Looking through my collection, I'm finding stuff that I completely forgot about. Like my Snoopy's Christmas With The Royal Guardsmen album. Or the fact that I put Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting" and Wild Cherry's "Play That Funky Music" at the end of Jane's Addiction's "Ritual De Lo Habitual." Or that I can listen to Kermit the Frog sing "(It's Not Easy) Bein' Green ANYTIME I WANT. Or that I got a copy of "Bachelor Pad Royale Vol. 4" from none other than my hyper-conservative former roommate Micah. Or that I own four times more Smashing Pumpkins songs than the Smashing Pumpkins released. Or that I have at least 5 CDs that I actually sing on. (There's one I've never told anyone about, called "Green Pancakes and Soup" that no one must EVER hear.) Or that I did have the cultural aptitude to purchase the complete Beethoven symphonies. Or that some of these Nirvana recordings are going for $60 on EBay. Or that the first CD I ever bought was "Chant" by the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos. I could go on, but the CD I'm listening to has 30 seconds left. Goodnight, and listen to more Ozomatli.

      CD: various, "What's Up Matador disc 1: Favorite Tracks"  A couple of entries ago I mentioned Dave, a friend of mine from Blasdell, New York. After I called him from the village courthouse there (it took a couple tries, the phone is primitive) Dave invited me to come over for a couple of hours, which, just like Dave, is very nice of him to do. Anyway, Dave's family has two dogs that I can recall: a larger black one that ARF BARK ARR!s and a more lilliputian one that YIP AYE AR!s At a previous visit to Dave's residence the larger dog was not happy to see me. It was late at night, the lights were on, and s/he probably thought I was going to rob Dave's Mom's Precious Moments figurines. Even worse, for some reason dogs stick their noses very close to my testicles. An angry dog, then, is cause for concern. This time, things seemed to be going well.   Until I opened the door a little too long. "Who let the dog out?" asked Dave, without intentionally referencing popular culture. "Oh, sorry. Um, sorry." I'm not much help. Dave disappeared in the kitchen. I was halfway to telling him he was going in the wrong direction when he reappeared with an individually wrapped slice of cheese. Dave and his younger brother Nathaniel went walking down the street, both with half a slice of cheese in one hand. "C'mon!" they would beckon. "Cheese! Cheese!" It took three minutes tops to get that dog back from the neighborhood. But afterwards, that dog treated me like the local butcher, polite forevermore because I gave him Freedom for a brief shining moment. I wonder, is this how they enforced the Fugitive Slave Act?

      CD: various, "You Are Here Magazine Number 9"  Three day's ago a woman came into my work with her four-year-old son. Give or take a year. By far he is the most charming person I had ever met there. We had a short but very pleasant conversation before her mother shuffled him along.  Boy: Hi, what's your name? F:   I'm Fred. Boy: Your name is Fred? F: Yep. What's your name? Boy: I'm Kevin. F: Hi Kevin! K: Do you have any pets? F: I have some cats. K: I have a fish. He's all mine and he's nobody else's. F: Do you play with him? K: And my sister has a hamster. F: Do the hamster and the fish ever play together? K: No, they're not near each other. F: Oh, I see. K: You have pet cats. F: Does your fish have a name? K: Yes. F: ... K: Do you know what kind of hamster she has? F: No, what kind? K: It's a GERBIL. F: Ooh, neat! Mother: Okay, Kevin, follow Mommy...

      CD: Nine Inch Nails, "The Fragile"  I live in a small hick village with lots of average white people. My house lies inbetween two trailer parks and is surrounded by a power station, a hardware store, a funeral parlor, an abandoned railroad track turned bike path, and a couple empty plots of land. None of this, however, compares to the even smaller hick village of Blasdell, New York, home of my good friend Dave and also a very polite man named Officer McCormick. It was the latter that caught me running a red light and gave me the opportunity to revisit what looks like Colonial Williamsburg, had Colonial Williamsburg been set in 1983.  There were two things I especially noticed during my court appearance. One was the Seal of the Village of Blasdell that hangs ominously over the presiding judge. What looks like an X intersection separates the seal into four unequal sections, which I pointed out to Dave after I gave his town $120. He had never noticed his village's seal before.  "See, on the top section there's the date the village was founded. Then there's a red house, and then a tree. Pretty good, because no other towns have founding dates, houses, or trees."  Dave: "I never noticed that!"  "But the best part is the left-hand side, where they drew a big metal bucket spilling out a bunch of molten steel."  Dave: "Yep, that's Blasdell!"  The other thing one notices in the village court/police dept./fire dept./meeting hall/teen center is the rotary pay phone at the front door. After several attempts to operate the phone using a calling card, the computerized operator said (this, unlike Dave's mutterings above, are a direct quote):  "Let's try this another way. Why don't you SPEAK your card number into the phone instead."  "I still don't understand you. Please speak your card number into the phone, sounding out each number separately."  Boss Hogg and Roscoe P. Coltrane would have been very comfortable here. I felt somewhat embarrassed that I dressed up and wore khakis to the hearing.

      CD: Beck, untitled unreleased upcoming album (beck.com)  Tonight I went to Sam's Club with my father, Jerry, who is now asleep in his underwear on the couch. Every time I go to BJ's Wholesale with Jerry (this is our first time together at Sam's) he gives me the option of driving the shopping cart. I recall that before puberty the notion of getting behind the shopping cart was privilege enough to make me and my siblings fight over the honor, usually running the bottom of the cart into my mother's ankles several times in the process. But after age 12 or so, I would usually find myself at another section of the store, looking for a sale on Parental Avoidance. Since 16, the honor of driving the cart has been paltry compared to driving the motorized cart that got us to the store. Now, years later, I question why my father acts like the mall Santa handing out lollipops when he asks if I want to "take the wheels."  The shopping carts at Sam's are the biggest I've seen outside of Home Depot. However, it is not the size of the carts that I wonder about, but how we use them. At one point my father leaned over to me and said, almost pretending that we were halfway into a conversation, that "all that iced tea is finally making its way so I'm going to find the men's room." In his absence I was to "watch the cart and make sure nothing happens to it." And for the first time I thought to myself, what would happen to it? Would something get stolen? What if something did? It wouldn't matter! It's not like we owned anything in the cart. It's not like we couldn't replace anything if it were taken from the cart. And it's especially not like someone would walk past and think to themselves "Hey, how convenient for me, bwah ha ha! Ten pounds of presently unrefridgerated Sam's Club ground chuck for me to purchase just as if I were in the next aisle where they are currently located! This is my lucky day!  " Nevertheless, I could envision my father coming back from a satisfying journey to The Other Sam's Club, realizing our cart was molested, and yelling, "Noooooooooooo!" In a year's time the Lifetime Movie Network would be rebroadcasting "Where's the Beef: Tragedy at Sam's Club" once every other week.

      CD: Drain STH, "Horror Wrestling"  The other day I saw the movie "Requiem for a Dream," which got me to thinking. That's a good thing! The movie was quality stuff, for one, but the fact that I am able to persue other intellectual pursuits this summer that don't involve schoolwork has really turned on the abstract contemplation juices. I'm even taking time to write a weblog, for gosh sakes! Not that I'm actually smarter, or that this blog is worth reading. But I used to go to a movie theater with friends at the end of a week full of writing and correcting papers, and pretty much just wait until it was over to go home and pee. I can hold it in better now, and I'm talking about the symbolism in the film!  Looking back at the previous paragraph shows that maybe I'm not as intelligent as I think I am this late at night. Anyway, back to movies. Though everyone has their (incorrect) favorites, the greatest movie of all time has to be--you guessed it--Frank Stallone. No, I mean it's "Pee Wee's Big Adventure." I must have seen it 30 times. Think of all the great adventures! The dinosaur! The Alamo! The singing hobo! Mr. T Cereal! Morgan Fairchild! And my favorite part, which I can re-enact for the amusement of my friends:  "On this very night, 10 years ago, along the same stretch of road...in a dense fog...just. like. this...I saw the worst accident I ever seen...There was this sound, like a garbage truck, dropped off the empire state building! And when they finally pulled the driver's body from the twisted, burning, wreck...it looked like... THIS!!!!!!  Hooo hooo hooo hooo hooo haaaah! Yes sir....That was the worst accident...I ever seen."  Even scarier, watch this scene frame by frame to see the extended tongue and the eyes pulled out of their sockets. Sleep tight everybody!

      CD: "Ken Burns' The Civil War: Original Soundtrack Recording"  Mom's birthday last night. After deciding to order Chinese and sit around at home, we all took our time looking at the take out menu we had posted on the fridge and, for once, were able to organize and plan. I was picked to make the call, menu in hand, and--who woulda thunk--no one answered the phone. Tried again. Jiminy. So we settled for Denny's. My parents aren't ones to go to a place with, say, $10/plate dinners. The truck stop and the local diner do it for them. Denny's is a little bit up the snooty list, so going there became a family event. They're alright people, once you get used to them. But my father and I have to stop getting the same things from the menu; this is the third time this has happened in about a week, and I'm starting to think I got a lopsided share of the genes. Anyway, you could tell it was someone's birthday in the family because we went to Denny's and everybody got to have dessert. Fine eatin'. And raspberry iced tea to boot!

      CD: Wipers, various mix CD  Happy Birthday, Sis. Since it's my sister's birthday, and I have nothing else to write about, this topic will be about her. Ask my mother, and she will say my first memory of my sister would be me looking at her from her cradle and saying "That's my sister and I love her." I don't remember that at all. Then again, I was probably two at the time it happened. The first memory I DO have of my sister is when I was about three, and while playing with my blocks realized my sister, brother, and box full of blocks were positioned in a close, perfect line. Ever the boy genious, I thought of dominoes. Now to test the theory! But my brother moved out of the way before I could reconfigure the calculations in my still-developing brain, and the end result was me pushing over my sister for no real reason whatsoever. I got scolded big time for that one. After all, she probably barely knew how to walk by this point. True story. Sadly, worse was done to her by her brothers during the next few years.

      CD: Nirvana, rarities mix (cleaning out my hard drive)  Here's a story I heard from my supervisor at work today. Now remember, my supervisor is about my age, but looks smaller and younger. Anyway, this guy walked into the restaurant the other day, smoking a cigarette. Which is illegal. "I'd like to order x___." "You gonna put that out?" she replies. So he throws it on the floor and stomps it out. "I'd like to order x___." "You gonna pick that up?" she replies.   "No."  "Then I'm not going to serve you."  "You're what?"  "I'm not going to serve you."  "There aren't any ashtrays in here anyway."  "Gee, why do you think that is?"  "So you're not going to serve me?"  "Absolutely not."  So he leaves. But not the building. He finds someone older and asks where the manager is. Somehow he is directed back to the same counter.  "I wanna talk to your manager."  "You're lookin' at 'er."  Silence.  "How about I call up your company and tell them you refuse to serve me?"  "How about I have the state police come over and fine you a thousand dollars for smoking in a public building?"  I guess the guy leaves at this point. But yes, he did call the company the next morning. To which the franchise manager says she wouldn't have served him either. I love happy endings.

      CD: Beatles, "Beatles For Sale"  I often don't do this... Okay, I do this a lot. I'd like to comment on the CD I'm listening to. "Beatles For Sale" reminds me of the Beatles story I heard where the original cover for the album had the band cutting up a bunch of toy dolls. The record company thought it was too risque and had the new covers pasted on the old albums, and if you can find any of those first printings, they're worth a lot of money. But more importantly, the title reminds me of a schoolmate I once had named Sal. Once in what I think was third grade, our class was coming back from a field trip from who knows where (do we ever remember what we did on those field trips? or just who threw up on the bus) when Sal saw a car parked in someone's driveway with the sign "For Sale." "HEY!" he yelled, "FOR SALE! THAT MEANS IT'S FOR ME! FOR SALE!" And I just thought that was the most intellectual pun I'd ever heard. So now, if I see "For Sale" signs anywhere I go, or even the title of this record, I think to myself, "Wow, the Beatles--for Sal!" What a lucky guy that Sal must be  -15 miles on the Erie Canal-

      CD: Beatles, "A Hard Day's Night"  Today I had the pleasure of trying to be a substitute teacher on a Friday, a shortened class schedule, AND Homecoming Day, all rolled up into one. Which, of course, means the kids didn't come to school for any other reason than to put on face paint, eat lunch, and prepare for a full ninety minutes of foot-stomping on the bleachers during the end-of-the-day gym rally. I competely disagree with the idea that children have a short attention span, because if you saw how much time and care they spent in applying glitter....Anyway, it was a lucky coincidence that the day I decide to wear a red shirt is the day I'm called in to a school whose colors are red, whose mascot is an Indian chief, and who practically made crimson clothes a one-day law for students and faculty. Go Chiefs, dude. Go Chiefs.

      CD: Ani DiFranco, various mix CD (3 of 4)  Sitting here in the school library (I have been here about eight hours now) has helped me invent a new game. It's called Name That Ringtone. That's right, folks! A brand new, reality-based game show (two television fads in one!) that pits the one half of conscientious, minding-my-own-business, trying-to-finish-a-paper students against the other half of "Hey-baby-wussup," "Okay-I'll-meet-you-in-the-computer-lab," "DON'T CALL ME NOW, I'M IN THE LIBRARY!" students. The game is easy. Listen to all the different cell phones going off (phones-to-minute ratio: 1:4), and try to guess 1) What song is incessantly blurting out of it 2) Where that noise is coming from, anyway 3) Will someone please answer it?! before losing your cool. Remember, cell phones are not allowed in the library facilities. But don't lose your cool, or you lose the game! Brought to you by these fine sponsors:  Centrum Silver Wonder Bread Panasonic Carnival Cruise Lines Pontiac  with special promotional consideration by  Milton Bradley  guests receive accomodations at the fine  Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills  "Name That Ringtone" is produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises and filmed in front of a live television audience in Television City, California.

      CD: Ani Difranco, various mix (CD 1 of 4)  Today I went from 0 to Sick as Hell in two hours. This is messed up. One minute you're up and ready to face the day, the next you've got water pouring like an open faucet out your nose. I seriously wonder where all this water comes from. Is it from the blood? In that case my blood must be extremely thick right now. It FEELS like the water came from my brain, which makes a lot of sense--my brain being a watertower and all, I mean. That would have explained the high pressure in which the water left my nose when I sneezed. (And did I ever.) I have easily gone through thirty Kleenex or Kleenex substitutes, such as toilet paper, paper towels, the backs of my fingers (in emergencies, and there were a few of those) and who knows what next.   The saddest part of all is that I went through all this while substituting a class. I lucked out because the missing guy has a student teacher, and that guy did all the work (not getting paid) while I sat in the back trying to prevent the snot dike from breaking (while getting paid). I am warm and I am tired. Good thing I also have class today, or I wouldn't have had a reason to get up this morning! Ugh.

      CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat" (Rocks!)  "You," if that is your real name, probably knows by now that I buy a lot of records. What to do if four great records come out on the same day but you only have enough money for two? Believe it or not this has happened to me before. Have you ever noticed that payday is always a day or two away from the time that you actually need the cash? Well, after mulling different travel plans ("Okay, I'll go to the bank on Tuesday, then the store on the way to class, and on Wednesday...") that would enable me to reallocate resources adequately--something the Soviets could have done if they implemented worker incentives right off the bat--I realized, Hey, I have a Credit Card! Click click click, done on the internet in two minutes. No gas money, bank hours or spare change needed! Why didn't you guys tell me about this before! It sure beats hiding a couple grand under my mattress....

      CD: Tenacious D, "Tenacious D"  Guess what! I'm named after my grandmother! I finally asked my mother why my name is "Fred." On her side of the family, she had a grandfather named Fred that died right before her and my father were married. She also has a brother named Fred. BUT, and this was the point she emphasized TWICE in the conversation, her mother's nickname is "Fred" as well. Yes. Grandma's real name is Catherine (coincidentally, my sister's middle name) but those her age apparently call her Fred as a gesture of compassion and friendly jesting. Let me reiterate: I have a Grandma Fred. The genes are strong enough to perpetuate the family line. Aren't you worried about this? Do you understand the implications? These people are breeding!!

      CD: Beatles, "Yellow Submarine"  So I was making chocolate chip cookies at work today. Sue me, I'm in food service! Anyway, two of the chocolate chip cookies fused together in the oven, creating an uber-cookie of mass proportions and comparable, in political terms, to the NATO-Russia alliance. Can't sell it, but dang, why put it to waste? It was an hour before my break....OH, by the way, you should know first is that I work 10-hour shifts, and don't eat lunch. Therefore, the prospect of chocolate chip cookies is more than mouth-watering, but mind-blowing. It's like an inspiration; a muse; a raison d'etre for the rest of the work period....ANYWAY! I was looking for the perfect moment to sneak the uber-cookie into my packback (I brought homework, but never did any of it).   Enter Ted, the 81-year-old dishwasher. I was gone for FIVE SECONDS. I come back, there's no uber-cookie, he's chewing on something! Big mouthful, can't even talk, hiding his face in the corner. That bastard took my cookie! My hideously malformed, illicit uber-cookie! @%#^*@&! I was really, Really hungry and it was gone! Man. You don't know how much that hurt. Like taking candy from a baby. And for him, it probably was. Schwag.

      CD: John Lennon, "Live In New York City"  I keep strange things, and put them in strange places. No, not there! Let me explain my ambiguous statement. Today I was driving to the gas station (an irony in itself) when I spotted tons 'o stuff being thrown out at one guy's house. I think it used to be the house of Harold, the nice and really old guy that used to be a janitor at my grade school. He must be long passed or moved by now. He was at Pearl Harbor, you know. "Weeee KNEW they were comin'!" he'd say.   What was I talking about? Oh, so a piece of refuse caught my eye. It's one of those carpeting sample things, 4 samples by 7, and each rectangular sample the size of an index card. Where some would pass by without thinking, I glanced at it and decided the sampler was a lovely piece of post-modernist art. I mean, you got your fabric, you got a progression of ever lighter hues, and you got an emotionless, manufactured arrangement that says "Warhol" all over it. You should see the other crap I have in my room.   And stop comparing me to Christopher Lowell!

      CD: Oasis, "Be Here Now"  Oftentimes I will listen to music and just not "get it." I can read pages and pages of press about a band and think yes, I WILL risk fifteen dollars on this one ($15! Thank goodness for KaZaa, lucky broadband people!) listen to it once--usually while reading a newspaper or writing this bloody thing--and think "eh." This happened with my Sleater-Kinney album about two days ago. But then, at some future date I will put it in my car and the moon will be in just the right place and suddenly I will achieve musical oneness with the songs. I will feel the minute nuances in the vocals and the rhythm and melody and I will say to myself "This is genious. So THIS is how you're supposed to listen to it. They were right!" In a metaphorical sense, what I think I'm trying to say is that gardens are nice, but flowers in the desert are nicer. Is that understandable? I hope so. Thanks for the indulgence.

      CD: Jimi Hendrix Experience, "Axis: Bold As Love"  It's regrettable that we live in a society where women cannot walk alone in public places. Then again, at least they can be in public places, unlike Iran, and at least they can walk, unlike pre-colonial China. Still, one out of every five women in America are victims of sexual assault. So while I was going to start off this post by saying "Why are people so paranoid?" I've rationalized a bit more. Here's the problem, however. I'm a very fast walker, and it has made me look like a ravenous predator. At places like the college campus or anywhere with a sidewalk, it seems, I have somewhere to go while the women walking half a block in front of me apparently do not. This means that at some point I will pass them. Now sure, they might hear footsteps coming behind them, but it's even more possible that women have a sixth sense that a lone young male is coming up behind them, even from forty yards. (Maybe they have eyes in the back of their head, just like mom!) I instantly become a threat. You will observe the quick "I'm turning my head slightly but I'm not looking back and I'll pretend like I'm going along my business without looking worried about you" glance. As you come closer--staying as close as possible to the exact opposite side of the sidewalk so as not to look like you want to engage her--a minority percentage will tersely change their direction. Most just keep pretending like they don't notice me, which is the best thing, but the least amount of people consider slowing down and actually letting me pass them. What the heck, am I really that creepy?  Don't think it only happens between sexes, either. I was walking down Bleeker Street one Saturday night in NYC when, after several blocks, I was coming closer to a man going in my direction. He eventually started walking faster, and then quickly crossed the street. Mind you, I was still about half a block away. We walked parallel until I passed him about five blocks later. Ironically, I was suffering from an inflamed knee joint at the time and was trying Very Hard not to look injured and get assaulted myself; the only reason I was walking fast that night (I had nowhere to go) was that it hurt too much to stay on one leg for too long. If the guy had actually started chasing after me, I wouldn't have been able to run. So in conclusion, if a guy's walking up from behind you ON A BRIGHTLY LIT STREET, IN FULL VIEW OF DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE, LET THEM PASS YOU. We just want you to move out of the way; we're late for class dammit! Thank you!

      CD: Jimi Hendrix Experience, "Are You Experienced?"  It happens to you every couple of years. You have one in your closet right now. In fact, you wore it just a couple of days ago. The Pants With the Loose Zipper. We all have one. The kind of pants where you're walking down the sidewalk and then realize "it's time to check." The pants whose zipper refuses to stay up. Were they made wrong? Maybe you could get a safety pin and... No. That just wouldn't be right. Anyway, what if I accidentally pricked my... Yeah. Why do they do that? And why is it I always forget THESE are those pants until it's almost too late, right before I'm about to walk into a room full of people, or as I'm talking to someone while standing up? It never fails. No, wait, it ALWAYS fails. And I really like these pants, too.

      CD: Alice In Chains, "MTV Unplugged"  I realize now that it takes one hour to get here--my college--and then one hour to get back from my two hour class. I am not amused. Granted, I save thousands by not finding an apartment in the city, and even another $100 or so by parking across the street, about two blocks from my classroom. Why do I mention this today, and not three weeks ago when classes started? Because--and this is the saddest part of all--I had a paper due today, so I procrastinated for a week until I finally sat down and wrote it, then on the way to school remember it takes a WHILE to get there and ended up ten minutes late. And I can't blame traffic or weather or accidents or a poorly running car or horrible road conditions or a parking problem or the police or the suspected terrorists from Lackawanna or my mother or President Bush or even Frank Stallone. And THEN, to make up for my lateness, I had to force myself to participate in class to look like I hadn't missed anything and really cared about the discussion at hand! I almost NEVER participate in class because it bothers me so! Cursed space-time continuum, forcing me to find witty comments and universally accepted syntax and diction to spew forth like dandelion seeds towards a group of people I would hardly recognize on the street! Curses, me!

      09 16 02   CD: Patti Smith, "Gung Ho"  My table is cluttered with unfinished business. From the far left to the far right: 1.) The book I have to finish reading for class next week. I'm about 20% done. 2.) Education loan forms that must be compared to my old tax files. Descrepancies must be forwarded to the bank for re-examination. 3.) The bill from grad school. I'm expecting a check, which help pay for #2. 4.) Four CDs that must be copied by the 19th, before they're due back at the library. 5.) CDs I actually bought, that must be entered into my database with the CDs I'm about to burn. 6.) The crate of copied worksheets that should be organized chronologically for use in a school setting. You know, for that job you want to get? 7.) Reciepts and work slips that must be put into appropriate folders. 8.) AOL E-mail printout, which must be saved in case they bill me $23 for an account I never bought (and they said they would fix). 9.) Blank videotapes. I'll use one tonight but these should be put somewhere else. 10.) Newspaper clips that require a typed-out summary for a class, due Wednesday. 11.) An ad for the new Danko Jones album. Just finished writing an E-mail asking for free tickets. 12.) CDs that must be put back in their cases from their rotation in my car. 13.) That reminds me, look up the costs/benefits of trading in my 2001 car for a 2003 that has a no-interest payment plan. Dude, I better do that one now.

      CD: R.E.M., "New Adventures In Hi-Fi"  Dangit. I wore pants tonight. I want some more shorts weather so I don't have to deal with full coverings. Sooner than you know it I'll have to wear a long-sleeved shirt, too. Ugh. And in my free time! There's always that one momentous day in, oh, late October where you transmogrify from a summer wanna-be shorts-wearer to a temporarily permanent, leaf-rakin' pants guy. Think about it. You can never pinpoint the date, but in hindsight you think back on it and realize Hey, we don't live in the Arctic Circle, but there are 6 months of pants and 6 months of shorts, and now everything is dark again. Time for 5 PM sunsets, examining the walls of your house for egg and shaving cream remnants, and the manditory "AAA says more people will be traveling during Thanksgiving than any other time of the year" reports on the local news. Must...fight...power....Must...take off...pants...

      CD: PuffyAmiYumi, "An Illustrated History"  Not that I want to make Buffalo State a home away from home, but it's getting there for me. I joined the radio station club, and have to go through "training." So far so good, especially when training gives me the time to read the newspaper and the liner notes to CDs I don't own. Yet. Bwah ha ha. After noticing I actually had some of the CDs in their rotation in my own collection, I started feeling more like a musical genious and went shopping for some more of the stuff. After picking up the CD I'm listening too right now, the alt/college clerk asked me "are you ready for the invasion?" "You mean, the invasion of..." "PuffyAmiYumi," we said in unison. So today is a first; I had a conversation with a record store clerk about Japanese pop music. And I actually new more than he did. I'm in. I am SO in now.  By the way, in my opinion I'm sticking with the Pizzicato Five. Puffy is too synth for me, and I prefer the retro lounge feel I get from Nomiya Maki's vocals and the richer instrumentation in P5 releases. Now that Bis is playing in my stereo, I'm having a bit more fun. If I had heard Puffy before I heard Pizzicato, I'd probably be enamored with both bands by now. Odd equation:  Bis + Pizzicato Five + Natalie Imbruglia = PuffyAmiYumi  Now go listen to your Puddle of Mudd album.

      CD: Oasis, "Be Here Now"  Last night I was two seconds from impulse buying Jaffa blocks at Tops; 2 for $5. That's a good deal! They're the ones that you can either use as milk crates--like for my records, which I could really use--or for hanging files--I could really use that, too, for all of the teaching supplies I've stolen over the years--there are too many dashes in this sentence. Nevertheless, I just came back from The Mall, where I suddenly thought "I should buy some posters, because the only interesting thing in my room is the paint falling off the ceiling." I walked into that hippie place and found two pretty good ones, 2 for $12. That's a good deal! One was a Sistene Chapel close-up of God's and Adam's fingers; the other was a Radiohead poster of the U.S. blowing up, or something eerie like that. But I chickened out again. I don't buy gum, candy bars, bottled water, or anything else from the checkout line. I don't supersize my value meals because I pack peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I only read free newspapers, or take the ones already paid for from lounge room tables. I'm a lousy, incompetent capitalist. Sorry.

      CD: Led Zeppelin, "BBC Sessions"  Nobody's noticed, but I'm getting fatter. I know because I have a really mooshy tummy when I sit, in medical terms. I only used to have a smaller, moderately mooshy tummy, but now sometimes it's bigger, but softer. My lack of nutritional or health knowledge tells me that all that water will eventually solidify into fat. On a more scientific note, I also know I am getting fatter by my boxer shorts. Where they used to only ride part way, now they ride waaaaaay up. Luckily my fat self still wears shorts, so I can reach up in there when behind my car or in an empty hallway. Not that I did that today. By the way, when I mean "fat" this means about three pounds, (measured my friend Joe's grandmother's bathroom scale) now putting me at the average weight for my size. Still, the water is hardening; who knows what the future might bring? Thank goodness for new McDonald's low-fat cooking oil. [TM]

      CD: Money Mark, "Push the Button"  Tonight (actually "last night" because I'm writing this on September 10th) I was driving to the magical Truck Stop to meet my parents for dinner when I spotted quite a large fire burning in an empty field. It looked pretty cool. Then I thought about how it was strange nobody was watching the fire, especially when the house not too far from it seemed to be empty. Usually in this rural town you will see the smoke from controlled field fires, or illegal backyard burnings. Being uneducated in agriculture, I figured they were doing it to enrich the soil, and they were doing it in the dark so they could catch any stray sparks before they flamed up. Or something like that. Either way I didn't give it much more consideration. Then, driving my father back on the way home (my mother left early to watch "Emeril Live!" on the Food Network [?]) I asked him, "hey, did you see the fire on the way here?" Just as it came out of my mouth, we saw smoke, we saw fire trucks, we had to take a detour around a hill. Chances are, lightning caused the brush fire, and the whole field was ablaze. Had I known then what I knew now, I probably would have done something, even though it probably would have ended up happening anyway. And somehow, I think this sums up how everyone has looked back at the past year.

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Reel Time Sessions" [disc II]  The original idea behind starting a weblog was so that I could work on writing, especially about myself, for job applications, school papers, and the like. And while I have written much more than I would have under the cirumstances (nearing seventy entries, each at least a half-page of text in an ordinary word processing program), it now gives me yet another excuse to avoid doing the very thing it intended to improve! As of this writing I have just finished a two-page paper that took me two hours; it should have taken me 45 minutes. After every half page of text--exactly one paragraph in the paper, coincidentally--I got mental block. Like right now. And coincidentally again, I am at one-half page of text.  Worst of all, no one is ever going to see that paper. It was optional, and I wanted to get some "practice" in before class discussion. Beyond that, even I may never see it again, because it costs ten cents per page to print in this bloody library. Man, funk dat!

      CD: New Kids On The Block, "Hangin' Tough"  Recently my former roommate Dave commented to me that recently he has not been able to "notice my distinctive scent" anymore. Though I have tried a number of subtle tactics to reduce my alleged odor, including perioding bathing, the washing of clothes, and even a diet including moderate to large amounts of liquids, I must also think that Dave's olfactory keenness was fine-tuned over time to notice my scent while I was living with him. Why, just recently I was doing homework when I simply stopped and looked up. Something was just not right, and I could not pinpoint it for several minutes. Then I realized: I could hear myself think. After four years of being a collegiate resident, living with at least three other people and their varied eating/sleeping/blaring music times, unplanned nights out, and impromptu wrestling matches, I can now read a book without interruption. Which means I can't. Every few pages I have to go get a drink of water, put on a CD or--stranger yet--read another book. Dorm life has destroyed my sense of continuity.

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Reel Time Sessions"  Sometimes a person can do something that will make them smile. Smiling seems awfully goofy and awkward when you're by yourself, however. I once saw a show that asked the viewers if they've every really laughed when they were alone; no contact with the human race like television, radio, books, or people-watching in the mall is allowed. The man may be on to something. Nevertheless, I'm smiling because I got into my father's room (usually locked), installed the microphone to his computer, and made brand new sounds to temporarily replace the normal AOL defaults. Instead of "Welcome" I now ask him personally, "Hey, what's goin' on?" Instead of "Goodbye" when the phone line cuts him off, he hears me say "Hey, I'm trying to use the phone!" which is usually what he hears from the phone anyway. But my favorite is the famous "You've Got Mail", now my impersonation of the now-popular skit from "Crank Yankers" starring Special Ed. If you've never heard it, download it from Kazaa. My father is going to give me a piece of his mind this time tomorrow, but I'll be smiling then, too. Hey, at least his microphone's installed.

      CD: Remy Zero, "The Golden Hum"  Yesterday I came into the house to find the cat eating last night's casserole. Apparently no one fed the cat, or the cat was still hungry. Either way, the casserole from last night was left out uncovered for the cat to feast upon. I should have thrown it out right there, but after shooing the cat I put the rest on top of the fridge with the sign "Cat was eating the casserole."   My mother, who likes to keep a bucket of compost in the kitchen just a little to long as habit, responded. "Well I'm still going to eat it, I'm hungry!"  Today I came home and looked in the fridge. Day-old tomato soup. Browning salad. Hot dogs hardened by exposure to air. And a spider, sentry keeping watch over the Tomb of the Unknown Leftovers. I wasn't going to eat that crap anyway, but tonight I'm going to take a stand for sanitation. Something tells me I'm going to be much hungrier by the end of the week, or at least a much more efficient, single-serving cook.

A celestial mix of free time, applicable websites and useless chore recollections have finally got me to install--and run successfully this time--an NES emulator! Hot diggity dang! That means I can play my old Nintendo games on the computer! Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3! Mega Man 3 with the really cool music (okay, the music sucks today). Tecmo Super Bowl, with Bruce Smith! Ninja Gaiden, The Legend of Zelda, and Tetris! Tetris, everybody! I know somebody's reading this. TETRIS!  Contra and the Konami Code! Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, B, A, select, start! All of Middle School is flashing before my eyes and yes, by "all" I mean my ENTIRE middle school life! Stop laughing!

      CD: George Harrison, "All Things Must Pass (anniversary reissue)"  My sister recently broke up with someone. She told me very little about the actual person, but did tell me a lot about his parents' pet lion. As I remember hearing it, a long time ago (before this person was born or not I don't recall) the father got the family a pet lion, and kept it in the backyard with a very high fence. The police, not wanting to have to deal with future lion problems, would actually come on the property and taunt it, trying to make it do something illegal so they could have it taken out of town. In retaliation, the father installed spike strips on the driveway whenever the family went out Eventually the trap worked: the police drove in to taunt the lion again, their tires busted, they called for backup but the backup got their tires busted too, the family came home and the father says "Hey, what are you guys up to?! You were going to taunt my lion again!"   It sounds like Aesop should attach a moral to this one. "Don't tap the glass" or "Make sure you have a warrant" or something.

      CD: Steve Fisk, "999 Levels of Undo"  Canadian money has gotten really messed up lately. I don't know if it's the bad exchange rate, or the new dollar redesigns in the U.S. that are making them jealous, or the fact that they ran out of all their old change while using American vending machines, but Canadians have tried a lot of tripped out changes. The first one was the dollar coin, which is a good, rational idea, but then they thought about the TWO dollar coin, which really looks like a little coin melded with a big fat donut of a coin around the outside. Then they thought "Hey, why don't we add a shiny hologram looking thing at the corner of this bill" and "Hey, what if we use twelve colors on this bill" and "Hey, while we're at it, let's use this picture of my kids playing hockey in the backyard and put that on there too, and here's this poem about World War II that I like, we can fit it in somewhere." Even stranger, if you look at the back of some of the newer quarters you can find moose, spacemen, stick drawings of people, and Thor knows what else. In conclusion, since the NHL started migrating south Canadians have basically lost the will to live. Their search for new hobbies has come up dry (it's not like they have anything to clean up there) and this is the result. Sad, I know, but it keeps them occupied. But I fear for their stamps.

      My college is quite diverse in terms of age demographics. Today we "introduced" ourselves to the class, where we have your forty year olds, your twenty year olds, your sixty year olds, your parents (not YOUR parents, but people with kids, in fact one guys wife was going into the hospital tonight for induced labor) and your people that came in thinking it was the economics class next door. The first person to introduce himself was a guy who, instead of just giving his name and occupation like the rest of society expects of him, spoke for ten minutes about how he came from Senegal and then moved to China for a year with a scholarship, had to learn engineering in Chinese AND Chinese at the same time, then excelled in his grades so greatly that he was able to get another scholarship to learn English and then come to the United States. And had he spoken last, we would have been very proud of him. Instead we all gave each other glances as if to say "I hope I'm not going next." "I have nothing to say. This guy won." "Shut up already, we're impressed, leave us alone." "This is only supposed to take a minute; I have to go soon, I have a baby on the way dammit!" We hope he doesn't talk again for the rest of the semester.

      CD: Collective Soul, "Disciplined Breakdown"  Natalie Imbruglia saved my life last night. And this morning. After a long day that started after a four-hour-night's sleep, I found myself driving home at 5 in the morning so I could go to sleep for another 90 minutes. Ms. Imbruglia could be depended on for her soothing yet introspective song stylings that not only kept my attention, but got me to sing along to her catchy refrains at the top of my voice, keeping me awake and alert as well. It does not have to be mentioned that I was alone and my car windows were closed shut during this exercise. And this morning, after said ninety-minute-night's sleep, when I had to drive another forty miles to take my sister to work, and my eyes were 80% shut during the entire drive, the album "White Lilies Island again deliverd vibrant pop soundscapes for me to croon too as I feigned consciousness. Because of the dozens of times I have found myself listening to a certain musical genre this summer that would normally reduce me to nausea, I declare this the Summer of Natalie Imbruglia. Sorry, Nelly, but it's too hot in herre for you!

      CD: Bruce Springsteen, "The Rising"  Mad shout-outs tonight. First, shout outs to the gas pumpers at the Totem Pole for doing their job, rain or shine, snowstorm or heatwave every day. Second, mad props to the school secretaries for keeping it real with politeness and sincerity even in the midst of the jungle. Third to my peeps on the Thruway, the toll-takers, construction workers, travel plaza associates, and miscellaneous that keep everybody moving. Fourth, everybody at the IHOP on Maple (what a coincidence, the names are!) for their high standards of quality and wide selection. And last but best of all, everyone at the many Blockbuster locations in Buffalo for their mad crazy phone tree system. We found the perfect movie at 12:30 in the morning, and couldn't have done it without the support of my B-Buster peeps on Delaware. Everybody watch "Fear of a Black Hat"!

      CD: Vines, "Get Free" promo  I did it! I wrote Subway an E-mail. Actually it was a Customer Service form I found on their website, but I still did it! I had to provide a whole bunch of information about where I lived, the address of the Subway I went to, blah blah blah, but I still did it! Woo! Here's my letter:   You guys are great! I would eat your subs three times a day if I could. Seriously! I had the Chicken Teriyaki today and the Italian B.M.T. the day before. They really hit the spot! I'm going to try some of the other sandwiches to see which one I like the best. The best thing about your subs is that they're big but they're fresh and light, so I can enjoy a foot-long but not feel too full afterwards. Friendly help, too! Keep up the good work!  P.S. The cookies are good, too!   I heart Subway!

      CD: Radiohead, "Pinkpop 2001" live bootleg  I ate at Subway again, and I'm telling you guys that place is GREAT. Sure, I can't think of another topic to write about today, but seriously. Subway makes great sandwiches. I've found myself staring at the writing on their paper cups a lot; you know, the ones with the charts saying how much healthier Subway subs are to Big Macs and Whoppers. This is true. Don't forget, however, that their chart doesn't figure in cheese or mayonnaise, or any other special stuff. And I eat foot-longs, not the 6-inchers. So really it's twice the calories, but that's just a tangent. If you're ever hungry and you need something fast, go get a Subway sub. The lettuce is fresh, they'll make 'em any way you want 'em, there's a Subway on every other block, the prices are decent, the people are friendly, there usually aren't a lot of people there, it's open pretty late at night, and, oh, I don't know, they're just really really really really GOOD! I mean it you guys, eat there! You think I'm kidding around! I think tomorrow I'm going to write them a letter.

      CD: Robert Bradley's Backwater Surprise, "Live"  Oh man oh man oh man, I went to Subway the other day and had yet another AWESOME Subway Sandwich. That place is so cool! How many times do you walk around thinking, "Man, I wish I was eating a sub right now"? Well, for me it's a lot! I parked my car, put a quarter in the meter, and six minutes later (I checked the meter when I came back) I had a 12-inch sub in my hands! Bonus! Only in America...'cuz in Canada they probably call them 30-centimeter subs or something. ANYWAY, from now on I will use my time at Subway to experiment and find the best fixin's for My Perfect Subway Sub. Today: the Italian sub with honey mustard sauce and cheese, on parmesean bread. (Did I spell "parmesean" right? I don't think I did.) Next time I'll try it without the pickles. Rock over London, rock on Chicago...Subway: Eat Fresh!

      CD: Supergrass, "Supergrass"  Umm...my day in a nutshell.  1:30 AM: Wake up from my three hours of sleep. Quick, take a shower, get a bunch of records, and drive 45 minutes to Buffalo State.  3:00 AM: Radio show. It went pretty well this time, though I had to get let in the building by a police officer this time because everyone else had gone home. To do what?  6:00 AM: End radio show. Found a couple of CDs lying on the floor that I figured I'd keep for my lonesome. The Vines promo, for one. Sweet. Also played a Wesley Willis station ID that he recorded when he was staying in the residence halls for a week or so last year. That guy can really rock and roll. Now it's time for work!  6:45 AM: Finish driving from Buffalo to Elma, New York to the school there. Change my shirt in the empty parking lot. I arrive early enough that I can set up things and still have time to start a paper I have due next week Wednesday.  7:30 AM: Start work. Easy day today, just playing the same movie for a bunch of classes. You can start to predict what the students' reactions will be to certain parts: when they will laugh, when they will all say "Ew!" at the sight of blood, and even when they will start and stop paying attention. Interesting.  2:30 PM: Finish work, kind of. During my free periods I finish that homework paper, which is probably the earliest I've ever done anything for a class. I'm almost an example to my students or something. Now it's time for Bus Duty, meaning I stand around in the cold making sure no one gets run over in the parking lot.  3:00 PM: Drive back to Buffalo.  3:30 PM: Lunch in Buffalo, at Subway! Subway rocks! I even had a discount card that gave me a free sub! Yeah!  4:00 PM: I have two hours until my next class. I go to the library and find out I owe $10 in late fines (@*$#*&^$!!) and read three newspapers. I'm hukd on fonix.  6:00 PM: Presentations in class. It's a good class, especially since I'm not presenting today. I make some comment about an episode of Antiques Road Show that actually isn't too embarrassing. Maybe I should participate more.  8:00 PM: Back to the library. Talking to you.  10:30 PM: Back home? Should probably eat something. Maybe call Dave. Dave doesn't read this weblog, so I can call him a monkey boy without him knowing.  12:00 AM: Zzz? Probably not...

      CD: Queens Of The Stone Age, "Songs For The Deaf" [It's good!]  Since first grade I have dreaded Fruit Cups. My secondary complaint is that the assorted fruit ones have way too much pineapple, and I can't stand pineapple. Why do they put it on hams? My primary complaint, however, has to do with the packaging; those little lift-up metal things on the top of the cans. I used to think that either I was Superman or the lid and the can were fused together or the opener part was just the weakest thing known to man. Four times out of ten I would rip that little lift-up little thing right off the top. Then I would be stuck with a completely unopened can, or one only opened part-way with just a tiny bit of assorted fruit juice coming out of the side. Mastery of fork maneuvering would be paramount in these occations.   Today at work, a similar situation brought my mind back to those days. I was trying to open a can of kidney beans with the same type of lid as the fruit cups. Maybe I have grown stronger since first grade. Maybe the lift-up things have become weaker. I ruined three consecutive cans without popping them open. In frustration, I thought "ah forget it," and so I took a pair of scissors (because we didn't have a can opener; what the heck?) and just stabbed the thing. Woosh. Kidney juice everywhere. Dripping from the wall, from the ceiling, from my hat, from the other wall. No fingerpaints for me that day.

      CD: Weezer, "Weezer" [Green Album]  My new favorite television channel must be NewsWorld International. Since it's not American, I get to hear about things that don't involve the words "sniper," "Osama," or "Tom Daschle". Also, the station is run by the CBC, meaning they interview people one at a time, instead of having them shout at each other via live satellite feed. But the best part? They also play news from Mexico, Japan, China, Russia, and Germany. My favorite one is Germany. Not only do they speak perfect English on the German show (even better than the danged English) they also report on the French. They're nice to the French, but why do the bread eaters always make themselves look bad? It seems the French are either on strike, hogging farm subsidies, pretending to be a superpower, talking like they're drunk, or making little to no contribution to the cultural capital of the industrialized world. Actually I'm kidding. But that last one there? I just read it in my history textbook. Yes; for Grad School. Zut alors!

      CD: Queens Of The Stone Age, "Songs For The Deaf"  Didn't do a bloody thing today besides sleep in, read, fumble wih my horrible internet connection, take a shower, eat leftovers, play Super Mario Sunshine, take a nap, and listen to the Queens Of The Stone Age album like three times. It almost sounds like a full day when you type it out. I've also spent an inordinate amount of time trying to pry a piece of beef out from between my teeth with my tongue. Using suction hasn't worked, either, so I may just have to go in with the brush. Sometimes I wonder whether I should just ban certain foods from my diet because they always get stuck in my teeth. Apples, for example. Also some chicken, but not all. And corn; I forgot to mention corn on the cob. Nasty on the chompers.

      CD: Rufus Wainwright, "Rufus Wainwright"  Aw, Jiminy. My social life has just decreased tenfold. Here at the college library computer lab we used to be able to download Instant Messenger every time we used it. It was annoying, but hey, it's still better than dial-up. So I would talk to people here at will because I PAID FOR THIS CONNECTION GOSH DARN IT. Somehow, the lovely and talented people at the BS ITS have learned how to block the little button on the AOL.com page that would download the IM program, make me happy, and give me a reason (one out of, oh, three) to stay on campus after class. (The other two reasons, by the way, are Drinking and Petty Theft). So screw you guys, I'm a going home.

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "White Lilies Island" [Yeah!]  The city of Buffalo actually decided to have autumn this year, meaning no snow but cold weather. Last year we had summer until Christmas, then got eight feet of snow in two days, then had spring, which was really just the five months it took to melt the eight feet of snow. But either way it's time to put the fans away and turn on the heater. (Assuming you have a heater; it seems a large number of people in Buffalo do not.) Our heater prevents me from getting a cold by taking all the of the dust it's collected over the spring and summer and, using the a new technology called fire, makes the dust hot and circulates it throughout the building and into my nose. Therefore I have cold symptoms, not because I am sick, but because the heater is making me sneeze. Does that make sense? Basically, I have invented a cold vaccine.

      CD: Beck, "Mixed Bizness" single  Now that I'm a commuter, there are things about college that I appreciate more than I used to. One is ample eating establishments. I am overjoyed that I am a stone's throw away from a Subway franchise, and that there's a Mighty Taco right across the street. Another is long, once-a-week night classes. You actually have time to go to them, and you only have to make the drive once. Which brings me to the things I don't appreciate. Like, when you drive 45 minutes to a class that ends up showing a video. Or when you go just to take a 20 minute, multiple-choice test. Or when you want to use a computer in the library lab but there isn't one available. For three hours. Did I mention there's a Subway? Subway sandwiches are the bomb.  What was I talking about again?

      CD: Liz Phair, "Whitechocolatespaceegg"  News just can't get any funnier. Did you hear this one? Saddam Hussein holds an election, where he runs unopposed. No, that's not the punchline. THEN, he wins! That's not the punchline, either! Okay, THEN, because he is apparently so thankful to the citizens of Iraq for loving him SO MUCH that they give him 100% of the vote, he decides to free almost every prisoner in the country. That's right, he empties all of the jails. So I got to thinking, what do prisoners--mostly young males with a penchant for violence--do once they get out of prison? Well, maybe they can do something for Saddam Hussein, you know, as kind of a "thank you" for letting them out early. But what would Saddam need with violent, fanatically supportive males aged 18-35? Especially with this upcoming war with the United States...where will he find the time to figure this out?

      10 20 98   CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat"  Yesterday I worked a twelve-hour shift. I did it because they asked me to. I could have declined, and in a lot of ways I wanted to, but for whatever reason I always take on more work than I originally intend on. And then I end up doing even more than that. And I guess I end up enjoying it. I think I worked about 45 hours at three jobs this week, not including two days of classes and their homework, and not considering the 45 minutes of drive time between all of those places. Why do I like it? I get to listen to my car stereo, I meet new people, I get out of the house...all of those dumb excuses and more. Oh, and someday next week I'll get three paychecks in the mail. That makes me forget just how tired I am.   g1410/20

      CD: various, "Hype!" soundtrack  Awwww! It was so cute! I basically had nothing to do yesterday, so somehow I ended up at a CD store. That really has nothing to do with this story. But as I was driving back from the CD store, I took a few back roads because on the way to the CD store there was a lot of construction, you know, one-lane with a guy waving people through kind of stuff, and it was rush hour so I wasn't even going to try it. That has nothing to do with the story either. So as I was driving back, I saw these three little lumps walking around on the road. As most animals do, they are supposed to run across the street or out of the way, or at least pause, stare at you for a second, and then freak out. But these little lumps just sat down. They were to small to figure out what they were before I got to them--I thought they might have been retarded squirrels--but when I came to a complete stop from 62 miles per hour I realized they were two-week-old kittens trying to get warm on the pavement. Aww. Awwwwwww! So I watched as they looked around for a while and then figured out that they should get out of the way. I think the grey one was even asleep! Awwwww!

      CD: Ani DiFranco, "Swing Set EP"  I started playing Nintendo again, so any free time I thought I had two days ago has suddenly disappeared, as well as that tiny modicum of desire I possessed that told me tonight I would get that History paper done for Monday. Well, well, well. Whose fault is this? Not mine, of course. Mario has a new game out. The last time a new Mario game came out that I could play was Mario 64, which was totally sweet, and though I hadn't touched video games for about two years before that I lost my Thanksgiving vacation getting all 120 stars in that game. And here we go again. When I downloaded an NES emulator this summer I went into hiding for about a week while I tried to relearn Ninja Gaiden, so who knows how long this will last. By the way, if you look at the cover of Ninja Gaiden, doesn't it look like the Japanese symbols say "The"? I was at a store (Brand Names) buying a video game when I was 12 (Adventures of Lolo) and the guy kept telling the clerk he wanted "Ninja The Gaiden" and she couldn't find it on the shelf for the life of her. Adventures of Lolo was $19.99 and the only game we could afford without waiting another week to get a better one. One more addiction...

      CD: Radiohead, "Amnesiac"  I have spent the last twenty-four hours typing. Papers, E-mails, IM conversations, message board posts. I when I wasn't typing I was writing what I would type the next time I got to a computer. Somehow, between (a little) sleep, work, school, and about an hour and a half of driving time, I have typewritten about thirty-five pages of text. That's an estimate, really. Some were double-spaced, single-spaced...a lot was erased and rewritten. I must have used...six computers today? It sounds about right. Last year I found I have become dependent on a computer; this year I discovered that it must be strapped to my body in order to survive. I'm looking into laptops, but I'll probably chicken out because of the money. Even though I've oogled the specs online for several wasted hours in the past few weeks. Heck, today I spent so much time on computers that I actually crashed a Mac. A Mac! I thought that was impossible. Except for that one time when I was twelve and exploring a computer the first time. I don't know how I did it, but I started rewriting the boot data. Luckily we were both saved by a conscientious technology teacher. But that's a different story. I have to go now, as the amount of time I spend on a computer in one day is the direct adverse of the amount of food I eat. In other words, the last time was yesterday afternoon.

      CD: Radiohead, "Kid A"  Here's my day in a nutshell. This was posted at another topic out of necessity, but since I wrote it twice, I should post it twice...    Frederick Schrock 16 October 2002 SSE 540 Journal Article Dr. Fusco  Education, Summer 2002 v122 i4 p674(6)   The Technology Hub: a cost effective and educationally sound method for the integration of technology into schools. Joseph S.C. Simplicio.   This article introduces an idea which should be more of a reality in grade schools: the technology "hub", a center at the school where information can be accessed and transferred by anyone involved with the school, whether inside of it or out. Many schools already have some form of a hub installed or planned; numerous schools have practically replaced their libraries with "media centers" where computers take the place that rows of books once held.  There are many benefits to the technology hub. The author mentions that teachers can write tests onlin for students to access later, possibly in a resource room setting. Parents can go online and see what assignments their children have to finish for the week. Students, teachers, and parents can utilize a school's website for district news, library resources, or to communicate by E-mail if there are any problems.  What the article emphasizes is the use of Internet media as a medium for this exchange of ideas. This has not come to fruition yet in public schools. Library media centers use poor filtering systems that block out pornography (sometimes) but also research articles on Margaret Sanger or Adolf Hitler. In turn, E-mail is also banned. Websites of schools often go a semester or more without being updated.   The most frustrating thing about the current situation is that the technology that is used is often not compatible with what the students use at home. I am writing this paper right now in a West Seneca district school that lacks a PC. A copy of the Simplicio article remains in a floppy disk in my jacket, as the Macintosh cannot read the .pdf file it is stored on. I would E-mail the article to myself, but the filter would not allow it. Uploading this paper to an Internet site that I could access later resulted in one of many messages warning me that anything I click on could be viewed by a third party, which somehow erased the completed first version of this essay. It will not be until schools accept online communication for what it is meant to be, and not treat it like a closed-circuit television channel, that the rewards of having a computer in every classroom will be realized.

      CD: Erykah Badu, "Baduism"  Had a dang rockin' time on my radio show this morning. It's an odd situation that I play music at 3 AM on a Monday, because in one way I don't want anyone to listen so I can play whatever I want, and in another way I want people to listen to the strangeness I put on. And nobody is in the radio station that early in the morning, let alone awake on the campus, so I pretty much own the school for three hours. Today I played some of my favorite female rock acts--Bikini Kill, L7, Sleater-Kinney, and even Erykah Badu--and went on a small rant over how the station will put an overproduced group like Puffy AmiYumi on rotation (giant sellers in Southeast Asia, and even have their own dolls) but not the fanastically overproduced pop of Natalie Imbruglia. That discussion is one I'm sure I could only have with myself, and at 4:30 in the morning to boot.

      Cassette (yes, I have cassettes!): Cowboy Mouth, "Word Of Mouth"  An hour ago I got an E-mail from AmericanSingles.com. I vaguely remember signing up for an online dating service about two years ago, when I was trying to earn points for one of those goofy Read E-mail For Money schemes. Anyway, I found that in my small hick town of 3000 people there are about five women my age who have ALSO signed up at AmericanSingles.com, and have done so for reasons such as "looking for a date, nothing serious right now" or "a real man who knows how to treat a lady." Well, I'm not very serious.... Some of these people actually seem interesting, maybe even attractive. Nevertheless, I refuse to lower my nonexistent standards to contact one of these people based on the prejudiced assumption that doing so would bruise the social reputation I don't have. So there. And Hunnybunz82, I think I live down the street from you; tell your dog to shut up!

      CD: Frogs, "Starjob" promo  This is the 100th blog post. I started this blog in the summer hoping that it would help me learn to write about myself so I could better write up job applications, keep my essay writing skills up to snuff before graduate school started, to finally force myself to write a diary, and communicate with some of the friends I don't see anymore. None of these plans really succeeded, but here we are four months later. The posts have not changed much; sometimes I write them a day or two ahead of time now, and the tone somehow changed when people started saying they read the blogs on a regular basis (the one thing I regret is that fame has affected my art, though I am neither famous nor artistic). There are a lot of times when I am not listening to the CD I have written at the top of the post, but I have listened to it in the past 24 hours. (Right now I am listening to The Melvin's "The Bit" promo EP if you care.)  One really important rule that I set early on is that I must never write about anything important. Usually what I type is the farthest thing from my mind at the particular time, or only a small part of what's on it. I will never devote webblogs to my woman troubles, family problems, serious personal vices or anything of that nature. That way I can write something, forget about it, and the words will probably not be used against me later (part of the reason I record my E-mails and IMs as well).  But man, I hate these pop-ups, don't you? I can't stand these stupid things.   Well, my CD is done; I'm going to bed. Joe, you should really write on your blog. Ed, keep it up. Dave, you were an inspiration; too bad you're not still doing one. Anyone else who wants one can write to me.

      CD: Beastie Boys, "Root Down EP"  Some days I get to go in for work and there is nothing to do. When teachers are absent, they oftentimes just have their substitutes watch over study halls, or watch videos with their class. Not a bad job, really. Today was one of those days. All of my classes were canceled for something called "Orienteering," which involves teams of kids walking around the athletic fields, finding different stations and doing tasks to complete a checklist of Fun Activities. My station was called "Grab Bag," where students get a random free prize. That's it. I'm not going to sit out in a wet field in my good shoes for two hours playing trick-or-treat. What does that teach you, huh? So with permission of a number of parent volunteers (they thought I was one of them) I came up with a task:  "Okay, this is called Grab Bag, where you basically get a free prize for doing nothing. But that's no fun, so here's what you have to do. [pointing] I want you to run around those bleachers over there three times. This is the catch: do you know the song for Meow Mix cat food?"  Group of five [puzzled]: "Yeah...."  "You have to sing it while you run, as loud as you can. Got it?"  G5: "Uh...oh...kay..." [ten seconds later] "MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW! MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW...!"  "I said LOUD!"  Subbing rocks.

      CD: Beck, "Sea Change"  Today I visited the University of Buffalo Campus, got lost, and ended up in Lockport. I don't know. Actually I drove around Lockport, meaning I pretty much ended up a little south of Niagara Falls. I usually know the names of the little villages around the area, so when I drove past one of those "Welcome to" signs and found myself reading it twice to get the pronounciation right, I knew I had really screwed up my trip. At least I found those pillars near that lake. You know, that thing? With the thing? The greatest thing I got from the trip was realizing that when people talk about the University of Rochester they say "U of R" but when they talk about the University of Buffalo they say "UB." There is no "U of B." What a mindfudge. Then again, so is figuring out how I made it to Lockport...

      CD: various, "Surge Studio"  If I remember correctly, a couple of months ago I wrote an insightful little piece about a pair of pants whose zipper would not stay all the way up. Whether a defect in the manufacturing of the pants or intense gravitational pull on the zipper (insert joke here) does not matter; the point is the zipper only tended to stay up half way. When I told this to several people--ever have those lulls in the conversation where you don't know what to say next?--their reply was always, unequivocably: "Why don't you just get a safety pin?" Ew gross no! I am not eight, and I am not putting pins at precarious places in my pants.   Anyway, the update. I came into one of my graduate classes, and waited for the professor to arrive. When he did, I noticed that a number of specific appearance traits such as his bushy, landscaped eyebrows, his loud yet often see-through dress shirts, and a haircut that might be prosthetic, there was also a very nice pair of pants--with a safety pin hanging off the zipper. See, THAT's why I wouldn't do it!

      CD: Wipers, various mix CD #2  Here I sit so brokenhearted, waiting for a class that hasn't started.... I'm sure the deluge is a-comin'. It's gotta be, because two classes of mine are cancelled next week. All of my classes, however, have Giant Projects due, with deadlines that are distant but becoming ever more visible. All of this dead time is making me feel uneasy. I keep reassuring myself that one of these days I'm going to wake up and remember all too late that my fifteen page paper on the life of the tsetse fly (or whatever we learn in Education classes) has to be handed in that morning and I completely forgot to start it. That's why I'm doing nothing right now, right? Because I forgot to do something? Do I have anything due for the class I have in twenty minutes? I must have checked three times now. Did I wash my hands? Maybe I should wash my hands.

      CD: Illegal Art artists, "Deconstructing Beck"  So here I am, still at school, after getting here at three in the morning. My first radio show was a smash, considering nobody listens at 3 AM and on three occasions I forgot to turn on my microphone when I spoke. Since I didn't want to go home just to sleep, I staked a claim at the top floor of the library in a dim corner, and learned how to make my backpack a pillow. That worked for about three hours. Then I decided it was time for lunch, and enjoyed a walk around Elmwood and a bite to eat. Then, since I was only running on those three hours of sleep--back to sleep! In fact, this time I slept too long, and missed the first twenty minutes of my class, which was the very reason I stayed on campus all day in the first place. Geez. And even worse--or is it--when I apologized for being late the professor quite bluntly stated she had no idea I was gone, and then said "It's okay; at least you were in the library." Tally: Hours spent at school 18, Hours spent studying 0.

      CD: Eddie Vedder, various mix CD  Today is my brother's birthday. My brother was born about eleven months and three weeks before my sister, meaning that for one week every year they were the same age. I can vividly remember these from growing up, because for that one week my brother didn't have a little sister to beat up. He actually had to think twice, because he had to doubly justify his oppressive behavior. He would have to say something like "Nuh-uh, I'm still older than you 'cuz I was born first!" and she would reply "But I'm _x_ years old too so we're even!" Kids can't really get legal the way Johnny Cochrane can, so he was kind of stuck by this part of the debate. As a result, he would beat my sister harder than he usually did. Strangely, looking back on it I think she didn't mind as much, because for this once-in-a-blue-moon event she still had him, you know?

      CD: Rufus Wainwright, various mix CD  Since I've started a job that requires me to get up sometimes at five in the morning, I get to see a lot of things that I haven't in a long time. This, of course, is because I usually go to bed at five in the morning. However, there is something truly serene early in the day when you can see sunlight but not the sun, when the air still feels crisp and damp, when the the only people you see are delivering the morning paper. It's quiet, it's fresh, and though there is a full day ahead it feels like there is nowhere else you really have to be. A pre-coffee morning: nothing but you in some clean clothes and a waking but rested body. Between 5 and 5:30 AM, despite work, errands, and war on the evening news, it is still a good day.

      CD: Black Flag, various mix CD  Oh diggity, today I'm unemployed. That's what's so wonderful and magical about being a substitute teacher: you never know if you're working that day, UNTIL that day. Today at 7 AM I got a call to work, but that was too late; I can't get in on time unless they call between 5:30 and 6:30 in the morning. (Gee, I recall the nights when I used to go to bed at that time. They were two months ago.) So that call failed. An hour later, another call, this one asking me to teach, I mean "teach," middle school gym. Seeing how I majored in History in college, and played basketball twice in those four years, well, I didn't take that one either. And then, an hour after that: "Are you available to teach elementary school?" Oh heck. Colors, clocks and the numbers from 1 to 20? I can barely do that now! Darned if I can walk down the halls in a straight line. In conclusion, today is my day off, and I haven't slept well.

      CD: Black Flag, "Damaged"  The results are in from a yearlong study that searched to find the funniest joke in the world. You know what? They apparently found it, and it's not that funny. Something about some guys from New Jersey shooting each other. They say that Brits and Australians really like the puns, Germans think anything's funny, Canadians don't laugh, and Americans love to make fun of people that are better than them. Here's my favorite American joke: A Texan and a Harvard man are talking to each other.   Texan: So, where you from?  Harvard: Where I come from, we don't put prepositions at the ends of our sentences.  Texan: OK, so where you from, jackass?  Today I was also thinking about someday having a talk show on TV, just so I could invite Jimmy Dean's wife on it. And I would get to ask her, "So, how often do you eat "Jimmy Dean's Sausage?" Thanks, you've been a great audience.

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life" [See 11/01]  You know, it's a little bit disturbing when you're searching around the internet and end up looking at pornography by mistake. It's my personal opinion that I like good surprises, like winning the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes, and getting pornographic pop-ups is not one of those good surprises. Anyway, it's even worse when it appears on your screen when in your school's library. Did you know you can get charged with sexual harrassment if a boob ends up on your screen? Not cool. So take it from me, kids: when you're bored, don't start typing random words in the browser to see if they're actual sites. Especially if the site takes you to "blood.com". And by the way, "flickingboogers.com", disappointingly, does not exist.

      CD: Beck, "Sea Change"  The message board at this site is now officially closed. Officially as in you can still post on it, but who the heck is going to read it? I mean really, no one's read the thing in weeks. I'm happy it's gone, really, because it's a pain reading it at home. Case in point: I wrote a post about my sister a few days ago, and I sent her the link in an E-mail. It was her birthday, and I told her today that I was going out to get her present. She replied, "You're going to buy me that digital camera? Cool!" "Whuh?" "That link to the digital camera that you sent in the E-mail!" I still had no clue. Then I realized that when she clicked on the link the only thing she saw was the pop-up ad. She never saw the post about her at all. THAT's why I'm switching to dissek.com.

      CD: Patti Smith, "Gung Ho"  Today I came home to find not only ice cream, but chocolate cake, pumpkin pie, cookies, and best of all, Cool Whip. Yes, the brand! Dinner was awesome. When it came time for dessert (which was about half of the entire meal) I quickly busted out the goods. When it came time for the coup de grace--the CW--I tried opening it as I pulled it out of the fridge. It slipped out of my hands. Trying to grasp it, somehow I got my right hand stuck partway inside the bucket. Still in midair, I could see the bucket was going to fall in the wastebasket. No, not the Cool Whip! My left hand quickly moved into action. I don't know how, but the left hand was able to swing the jar towards my body so I could prevent it from hitting the ground. In the process I got a big gob of whipped cream on my pants, and my right hand was covered entirely by the sticky stuff. What now? Do you have to ask?! It was the tastiest accident ever! The only evidence that remains is the streak of white stuff on the rim of the garbage can from when I got so excited.

      CD: Foo Fighters, "One By One"  At work the television is set stagnant on CNN Headline News. Usually I look at Headline News like I look at USA Today, pointing to an article and telling myself "that's not news, that's useless information." You know, those trivial pie charts on the bottom corner of each section, the blockbuster movie previews on the front page that push a real headine involving national or international politics over to the side. And don't get me started on their "Viewpoints" page. Today I tried looking at Headline News from the perspective of someone trying to learn about capitalism. I learned tons. Headline News has about 8 minutes of commercials, like any other channel, as well as promos that start "Up next..." for their own profit. That's probably another two minutes, including inter-anchor banter. They always talk about the new movies out on screen or on DVD that you can buy, which is another four minutes of time. One of their biggest stories of the day was The First Day of the Christmas Shopping Season, complete with footage of people running like Legion's pigs into a shopping mall. Another two minutes. With that, a wonderful little segment on gifts you can buy for Christmas, with new computer gadgets and someone in a Hello Kitty suit. Four more minutes? Then sports, talking about team ownership and trade disputes and contract negotiations. There were some scores too, but let's give commercialism four more minutes here, since sports in America are for-profit industries. What else? Some report about how oil refineries are getting a bad rap for their environmental problems, but don't worry, their stocks aren't slipping and they look like a solid investment. Really, that was the conclusion of the piece. Five minutes there. And I almost forgot the stock market report; another minute! Now, count it up. What did I learn in half an hour?

      CD: George Harrison, "All Things Must Pass" 2000  David Letterman Is Back! Not the "Late Show with David Letterman" David Letterman, who is good, but the "Late Night with David Letterman" David Letterman, who was also good! Remember the memories? Dave trying to quell a fight between Andy Kauffman and a professional wrestler? The time Dave jumped from a trampoline onto a wall of Velcro? The time he hired a mariachi band to play in a neighbor lady's cubicle for her birthday? Today's episode was especially cool, because R.E.M. was the musical guest. Not the 1990s R.E.M. that everybody knows, but the indie newbies R.E.M. from 1983! They played twice, and one of the songs didn't even have a name because it was so new! AND they got an interview! (Michael Stipe hid behind Mike Mills during the entire thing). That's good TV! And to top it off, the featured guest was Julia Childs, who made ham and cheese sandwiches with Budweiser Beer! ROCK!

      CD: Smashing Pumpkins, "Judas 0"  Is it spelled triptophane? Anyhoo, Thanksgiving is the only time in America where it is considered polite to overeat. If you do not take seconds, or try at least two kinds of pie, you are a rude guest/host/family member. Aunt Ethel was working all day to make those 23 pies, galldurnit, eat sumpthin'! I find it strange because here in America two-thirds of us are overweight. You'd think that there were other days where this was really acceptable. Yes, Christmas is filled with ham and whatnot, but it's more about spending money (more about that later). The Fourth of July has hot-dog eating contests, but the latest champion--two years running--has been Japanese (competitors say it's unfair because the Japanese have two stomachs; no joke)! Easter has those big chocolate bunnies where you bite the ears off first, but nobody ever finishes them. On a side note, I was wondering why they didn't have big chocolate Jesuses instead, and then I though about how we eat the bunnies. For the first time, the chocolate rabbits made sense!   Do I?

      CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat"  I'm waiting on a friend. Is that a Rolling Stones song? Last week, one hundred students sat in this very computer lab and refused to leave as a protest against short library hours. I admire that, and would have joined in the protest had I known about it, but dang! How did they stay here so long without being bored about of their minds? They were probably Talking Amongst Themselves. Here I have the Internet, which is like saying "A weekend in jail isn't too bad as long as you have a good novel to read!" And the people I usually talk to? That's who I'm waiting for! So I must wait here alone at a computer hoping for an IM because I don't own a cell phone and the pay phones are fifty cents now and I could use my calling card but with pay phones they take an extra nine minutes off so what's that use and There they are. Thank goodness, I'm starving. I'll see you folks later.  "Brute Force Method. Eat 'em and smile." --Tim Schrock

      CD: U2, "Best Of 1990-2000: The B-Sides"  I took last week off of work so I could get homework done. I'm old enough now so that I don't believe I'll actually get anything accomplished, and I've lived up to my own hype. Five full days and nothing to show for it. How many times did I have the books in my hands, ready to type? How many times did I mentally plan out the days when I would get A, B, C, and D done, even down to a calculation of pages written per day? How many times did I say to myself, "I shall go get a piece of pie/check the mail/watch TV for 30 minutes and then start"? How many times did I finally give up and go to bed early? How many licks does it take to get to the center of my problem? One? A-two? A-three? I guess I'll never know. O sweet, sugary procrastination, how you torment me!

      CD: Ravel, "Bolero"  As I sat trying to find extra room in my stomach for the fish fry special, a dreadful thought occurred to me: on Thanksgiving Day, I will be required to stuff inordinate amounts of [bland] food into my body in an act of blind patriotism. Chances are I won't be cooking it, and the chances are even greater that I won't deserve it. So while at the diner, stuffed, I decided that I will fast for Thanksgiving; well, as much as I can without looking rude. The leftovers usually last until Christmas dinner anyway, so I won't be missing anything. But I definitely won't have breakfast or lunch, and I'm thinking of skipping dinner the night before as well. We'll be going to Grandma's for pie later--I'll partake in that because if I don't I'll be disowned.  Which reminds me: the day after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year. It is also National Don't Buy Anything Day, a protest against the pervasive commercialization of our culture. Instead of going shopping, spend some quality time with the family. Take a walk or make a snowman (where applicable), create handmade gifts, call a loved one. Don't let the Coca-Cola Santa tell you how to celebrate a religious holiday!   Or, just get some homework done. You promised you would...

      CD: The Presidents Of The United States Of America, "The Presidents Of The United States Of America"  Yesterday there was an ammonia leak at the Perry's Ice Cream plant about six doors down, at about 1 in the morning. The air was acidicly pungent: the ammonia got in your eyes, nose and mouth. It was odd because I was taking out the garbage at the time, so I thought it was that, and then I realized that my nose was burning from the inside, and there were cops and firemen all over the street. Within about 30 minutes we were asked to evacuate. "Evacuate" is the key word here, so my mother slept through the whole thing and my brother just kind of sat around. My sister went to visit a friend in Buffalo. My father tried turning all the lights off so the cops wouldn't come over, but when he found out they needed to pick up citizens with school buses he got all excited and volunteered to drive.  I was just about to go to bed, and though I wasn't worried about it I figured I'd check out the scene. Everyone without a place to go was asked to relocate to the town fire hall, so I drove up there. There were about 100-120 people there, mostly young families and really, really old people. It seems like fire halls are havens for senior citizens, what with the bingo display and the stacks of "Forever Young" magazine hanging around. I grabbed me a mag and enjoyed a nice cup of water. They broke out the coffee, pretzels and potato chips, and eventually the cold cuts and bread, but I just came for the atmosphere. Televisions were playing Conan O'Brien, with periodic crawls about us that didn't really tell us anything except that "no injuries have been reported." It was pretty boring.  The Channel 2 news truck was there, however. I don't think the reporter found much to talk about, but I could see him going for the Old Person interview, looking for the oldest, most haggard-looking people he could find. Shortly afterward we were told the police would let us back home. I stayed five more minutes to watch the local news; a young family also stayed because, of course, the dad knew they were going to broadcast live and he wanted to walk past the camera ON AIR! Whee!   So did I. Once the guy's report started I walked out the door, right behind the interview. Wouldn't you know, but waiting outside in an idle bus was my father, waiting to give people a ride.   "What's going on?" he asked.  "I just got on TV."  "Could you tell the people inside that a bus is waiting for them?"  I did, but only the young couple got on. Everyone had pretty much left except some really old people who had nothing better to do. This morning the power went out, meaning there's more trouble at the plant, but it's an ice cream plant, not a nuclear reactor, and there isn't much to worry about. So anyway, that was my evening.   Man: "Did you see me?! Did you see me walk by?!" Wife: "I did! You were on the TV screen!" Man: "Ha ha!"

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life"  A couple of nights ago I had a dream that Ed was dead. "But Fred," you could have said, "your head was in bed. Ed's not dead!" 'Tis true. At first I felt bad about the whole thing. After all, Ed being dead would be a bad thing. After a couple more minutes of dreaming I realized: I was supposed to visit Ed with Joe next month. Now what? I should call Joe! I wonder if he found out, too. Maybe I would have to break the bad news to him. I don't know Joe's phone number well enough to dial him in my dreams, so in the last few minutes of sleep I was able to assess the situation. How did Ed die? I should have probably found out. Who could I ask? Probably the person that told me he died. Who was that? I don't remember. Why not? Did anyone actually tell me? Hmm, awful fuzzy. Is Ed really dead? If he's not, am I making all this up? Why would I make all this up? Am I dreaming? Did I get up this morning? No? Well there you go. And then I woke up.  So in conclusion, Ed just posted a letter about going to the Danko Jones show last night so I have conclusive proof that he's alive. Thank goodness!   "I might not be the flashiest dresser in the room/I might not know how to look a girl in the eye/I might not have the right pick-up lines/but I'll show you what I got/you see when I was growing up I got the inside scoop I used to watch all the fellows down the block/when they worked I watched and I learned the Lovercall."

      CD: Beastie Boys, "Licensed To Ill"  I have an aversion to pork for disgestive reasons. It just doesn't dissipate correctly or something; if I were an expert in those kinds of matters I could explain in medical terms the more disgusting aspects of the situation while still sounding somewhat dignified. Nevertheless, I still find myself dealing with hot dogs on a regular basis. My intention is never to just "go get a hot dog" because I am always looking for better fare. There it sits in the fridge, however, taunting me. Say I am about to make some soup, or reheat a casserole. Hey, I can eat a hot dog while I wait? Then, somehow I must finished the package I opened. Nuts...by the end of the night I've had four or five of the things and my stomach is re-enacting that ship-on-stormy-seas scene from the Pepto-Bismol commercial. What are these things made of, anyway?  Studio mic: "C'mon, Dave, gimme a break." David Lee Roth: "One break, comin' up!"

      CD: Van Halen, "Diver Down"  Blank Tapes! Everyone must get they'selves some Blank Tapes. This week I had a great radio show, where each song was preceded by an audio clip from that great movie, "Shaft." It was so good it should have been recorded. And you know what? It WAS, thanks to Blank Tapes! Now I can relive all of the great moments I had, which in some cases will be the first time because I kept falling asleep! And last night, whilst watching reruns of Saturday Night Live on Comedy Central, they just happened to be playing the episode where the one and only Natalie Imbruglia sings! Thanks to Blank Tapes, I have this earth-shattering, breakthrough first American performance close at hand for all posterity! Thank you, Natalie, for an amazing live version of "Torn!" And thank YOU, Blank Tapes!  Shaft: "Why don't you stop playing with yourself, Willie?"

      CD: The Police, "Ghost In The Machine"  Cops are really friendly, but the only time you see them are when you've done something wrong. The same goes with judges; sure, they're polite, but they're also just about to throw you in jail or sentence you to death or something like that so when they smile it can really be aggrivating. I haven't had that sort of problem yet, because my crimes are so petty they're laughable in their own right. Getting up in front of a judge, then, is almost fun in my case. Last night I paid (through the nose) for a speeding ticket, but the cops and the judge were just so NICE about the whole thing. I even found out that the judge was the guy that fixed up my brother's old car a few months ago, to donate it to the City Mission. Now that's a nice guy! I paid $125.  Judge: "So why were you going so fast?" Woman: "I was late for a class..." J: "Oh, what do you study?" W: "Criminal Justice." [court breaks out in laughter]

      CD: Beck, "Mellow Gold"  Some time ago I parked in a lot near my school, and a bum proceeded to ask me for money. I wasn't going to give him any, but I was late anyhow so I couldn't even pretend to listen to him for a minute...  Bum: "Excuse me sir, but I was wondering if I could have a few minutes of your time. My wife and I have fallen on hard..."  Me: "I'm late for class! I gotta go!"  Bum: "OH!!" You ALWAYS 'GOTTA GO!!'"  That memory is still burned into my mind. Last week, however, another bum "helped me park" in downtown Buffalo. I thought about karma, listened to his speech, got tired of it quickly, and just handed over two bucks. You can't get anything for a buck these days, so I gave him two. Well, you can get 20 minutes worth of calls anywhere in the U.S. for only 99 cents, but I assume he doesn't have a phone. So there, two dollars. Still not feeling very nice because I tried bribing a bum to get him to leave me alone, I put about a dollar's worth of change in the Salvation Army bucket at Wal-Mart the next day.   Karma is real! That very day I also returned the pop cans that were lying around my house, and the money it made me was equal to the amount I gave to the Army and the second panhandler. Just like in "Abbey Road"!

      CD: Spice Girls, "Spice"  Recently I bought some new clothes, which is pretty much a once-a-year event. It used to be because I didn't have the money to get new clothes. I have the money now, but I don't need to wear anything. Well, that's not entirely the case. But I have several sets of clothes:  1.) Formal wear. Never wear it, never wash it, never wear it out. I have the same dress shoes I had in eighth grade.  2.) Dress clothes. You know, decent pants and maybe a tie. I wear these about a third of the time, so you can probably throw two or three shirts in the hamper after the week, as well as three good pairs of socks. This is for actual work, and I have the five shirts I need to get me through a good month if I mix it up right.  3.) A crappy work uniform. Only on weekends, and then they're hidden from the other five days.  4.) Xenophobe wear. When I come home, I put these on. Usually, plaid pajama bottoms with an equally disgusting plait button shirt. I probably look like ICP on the PGA Tour but I'm not leaving the house, am I?  After that, what else do I need? I do the laundry once a week (maybe) and no one is the wiser. And if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get out of my 3 and change into my 4; have a good night.

      CD: Pearl Jam, "Riot Act"  I'm working my way down to one meal a day again, but sensible meals this time. I used to eat one meal a day, but that meal would be, say, one pound of spahgetti and a couple Fluffernutter sandwiches. Now it involves a decent sandwich (hopefully from Subway!) and a glass of Something. So far this has been working pretty well. Last night, however, I decided to splurge on a salad. Oh man, I can't believe I just typed that. Anyway, this happened to be a salad from a truck stop, meaning that I had to find the lettuce under a quilt of cheese. Good cheese, yes, but still. And the salad was accompanied by a mug (yep!) full of Ranch dressing. Do you ever wonder why truck drivers have guts bigger than some states' panhandles, even when they don't drink most of the time? It's because the healthiest food they eat has fat like Oprah has...well, fat.   "Eve was framed" --bumper sticker

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Innervisions"  Belatedly, I must give a shout out to the supposedly loosely-related Congressman Ed Schrock of Virginia on his recent election to a second term in the United States House of Representatives. Ed Schrock is a stauch supporter of Reagan-era economics and international policies and can't stand gays in the military, which he believes was a failed experiment by the the Clinton Administration that ruined troop morale (this was an integral part of his campaign). He also served two tours in Vietnam and looks kind of like my grandpa. With 84% of the vote, Schrock defeated his Green Party challenger by a more than 5-1 ratio. Congratulations, Ed.

      CD: Erykah Badu, "Mama's Gun"  I spend longer amounts of time in my car now that my commutes between work, home, and school are more than twenty miles in any direction. It is not inordinate to find myself driving from 90 minutes to two hours a day. This means I listen to a lot of CDs, which I turn up until my ears hum and my mouth starts a feeble attempt at harmonizing with females and falsettos. But what to listen to when, say, your mother is in your car? Today I searched my CD collection in vain and settled on Green Day. I figured she couldn't take Beck or Radiohead ("Why do you have to listen to such depressing music?") and finally settled with Green Day. If you turn it way, way down, all you can hear is chord changes and no swearing. Past studies have shown that moms like Weezer but can't stand Nirvana. Jazz just makes the trip seem longer. Also, the Beatles are great but you have to let Mom do the choruses.   "I love how ESPN has NBA games on now. This is the change my life needed." --Jeff Gross

      CD: Alan Parsons Project, "Master Hits"'  Awwwww...I got me a new winter jacket today. "Tis sweet. All soft on the inside and with big pockets on the outside, with a giant hood that makes me look like i'm in a Naughy By Nature video. It's also a large size, meaning that hood can make me look like a scared turtle if pulled over my head. I hope to use this jacket during my upcoming trip to Europe, where I will spend a number of overnights on a train. I envision sitting in my seat, mummified by my coat, oblivious to the continent speeding past me as I get some well-deserved sleep. Most people are not energized by coat purchases, but this is my first new one since 8th grade--yes, 8th grade!--and to have a coat without missing lining or buttons is like manna. Maybe tonight I will sleep on the floor, in my new jacket, like a seven-year-old girl to her new swimsuit.

      CD: Radiohead, "OK Computer"  Yesterday my manager came up to me, and in a very serious tone told me, "you have a call." I never get calls at work, and I wondered who it might be. The man on the other end identified himself as a Chief Operations Officer for the company:  Him: Is this Frederick Schrock? Me: Yes... H: How are you doing today? M: Good, good... H: We recently found out that you were traveling to Europe in the next few months, and we were wondering if you would be a Secret Shopper for us in some of our franchises there. M: ...Um, sure...It depends on where they are, though. H: Well, we have several locations in the area of Bielefield, Germany. M: Really? I'll just happen to be staying there. H: That's excellent! ... By the way, Fred, it's Ed. How've you been?  Ed called from Germany. I haven't heard from him for three months, and got my work number from a friend in Nashville.

      11 11 02   CD: Portishead, "Portishead"  Tonight's topic is ice cream. When my family buys ice cream there is usually a big debate over what to get, and the ice cream is usually categorized into three main categories:  Vanilla. This means regular vanilla about 90% of the time, but may sometimes branch out to other bland flavors such as Maple Walnut. I do not hate these flavors but they don't make me very happy. These are the flavors the parents want to eat, without any reason other than brash conservativism. One may consider "Cookies & Cream" in this section, but it is rarely agreed chosen (too bad, too).  Fruit. This involves strawberries, usually. Or cherries. Or blueberries, or a whole mix of them in what is usually a vanilla-based flavor called "All American Moose" or something odd like that. Of course, you could always just buy vanilla and add fruit to it later, but then the ice cream just wouldn't look so neat coming out of the box. In my opinion, utterly useless.  Chocolate. In some form, chocolate must be present. ("Cookies & Cream" MAY count.) The best ones are the Death by Chocolates, the Fudge Brownies, the Mint Ting-A-Lings, the Cookie Doughs, the Peanut Butter Cups. I only approve of these kinds. Why? Because they have flavor, they taste like a real dessert (Strawberries!? Save them for brunch!) and thank goodness they have chocolate, the most important taste since Water. Why anything else?  I make it a point to be present during the Ice Cream Selection Process because I insist on having at least one chocolate ice cream chosen. In these later, more refined years, I almost refuse to eat any other kind. C'mon people...vanilla? If I put milk in the freezer long enough I can make something just like it. How about adding some magic cocoa beans, dude?! And chop up some candy bars in there so we can have two desserts at once! You gotta make sure it sits heavy in my stomach, because I'll be eating it for breakfast--the most important meal of the day!

      CD: Limp Bizkit, "3 Dollar Bill, Y'All"' (this one's really lousy)  I was just thinking about what I would do if I was Iraq. Not Saddam Hussein, but Iraq, because I'm not sure if I can sympathize with him. So say I'm Iraq. You've been bombing me just about every day for the past ten years, a little here and there. And now you want me to disarm, because now--suddenly--I'm a threat to you again. All these daily bombings were just a little recess horseplay, I guess. But anyway, unless I disarm and make myself completely vulnerable to attack, I'm going to be attacked and then disarmed. Either way, I'm going to get pantsed in the lunch line. So I can either eat my government-subsidized lunch without any pants on or drop the lunch and try beating up the guy that's been bullying me for ten years. Sure, I'm really hungry and could use the food. But isn't it still worth it? I just don't know...   Hannah: "Ed called you." Fred: "When did he call?" H: "Eight o'clock."

      CD: Foo Fighters, "One By One"  One thing I miss about college is the late classes. Sure, freshman year you are stuck with Intro To Useless Info at eight in the morning, but by the time you're a junior you're getting up at noon, and don't have classes on Friday. (At least, that was my situation. Bwah ha ha.) But in the "real" world, apparently this is not the case anymore. Waking up at 5:30, 5:39, 5:48, 5:57 and 6:06 is a big pain compared to Eventually Getting Out Of Bed around 11ish. This morning I was even later than normal because I had to wait my turn for use of the shower, something I haven't had to do since the Clinton Administration. Then there's "rush hour", probably the first time the movie's been better than the thing it was based on, and a modern-day oxymoron to boot. Dif'rent Strokes, I guess. Being cut off by a truck on the I-90 is my tuition now.

      CD: Medeski Martin & Wood, "Uninvisible"  I was supposed to stop talking about Subway sandwiches but I just can't. This story, however, is the best of all. As previously seen on "Blog," a customer enjoys Subway sandwiches, goes temporarily insane, and decides he wants to write the company telling them how great they are. Yesterday, they wrote back. I got an official letter from the central office (On Subway letterhead! Yes!) thanking me for my interest in the Subway family and for my words of encouragement. THEN I look again into the envelope and whoopdie-doo, there are THREE two dollar coupons off the purchase of any Subway product! That's right, they gave me $6 just for writing an E-mail! So if you're hungry, poor, and have E-mail access (it's hard getting that Trifecta) log on to www.subway.com and claim your free food!

      CD: The Busdrivers, promo EP  Unpacking from a trip is a real pain. I think it is especially tedious when the trip wasn't very long. There are clothes, of course. That's the most time consuming. I have yet to see someone who still had a neat suitcase when they came back home; usually there is a roughshod pile of debris crammed into one side of the case while the other side has some layers of clean clothes mixed in with random souveniers, as tectonic shifting has caused the folded shirts to mix with, say, the socks or a snowglobe. All clothes, whether worn or not, must be washed. Clean clothes may have been contaminated by close location to the "dirty clothes bag" and a lack of fresh airflow. Then comes the cleanup of miscellany: receipts, brochures you kept for no reason whatsoever, camera film rolls, that hotel card key you ended up not having to return to the front desk. Those don't have to be washed, but you have to find them first. During the trip you have excercised every one of the 13 pockets in your suitcase for the sake of convenience, and now you can't find a thing. Don't tell yourself these objects are useless, however, even though they are. If not cleared away, you'll be in Orlando finding cough drops you put in your bag in Washington three years before, look at it for a second, think "what the hey, why not," eat it and die of pneumonia a month later. It happened to President Harrison, you know.  Q: "Heigh ho for our Cape Cod, Heigh ho Nantasket, Do not let the Boston wags Feel your oyster basket." -Original verse to "Yankee Doodle"

      CD: Cee-Lo, "Cee-Lo Green And His Perfect Imperfections"  While taking a driving break on a trip from Terre Haute, Indiana to Buffalo, New York, my buddy Dave and I stopped to eat at a Blimpie's Subs outside of Akron, Ohio. But this wasn't just a Blimpie's Subs, oh no. In the same room as the sub shop was a Nextel cellular phone dealership, bottled wines for sale, a candy shop, condoms (right next to the suckers on the shelves, and several giant windows where you could see the automatic car wash at work. Also, the room was half of a building where a full Dodge dealership was located. How does a room make any sense? So in conclusion, if I were to anthropologically study the people of Akron, Ohio based on this store I would see wine and clean cars, condoms and kids' candy, and cell phones and automobiles. And I would think to myself, "These people have no laws."  Today starts the daily Random Quote. At the end of each post I will quote something I read or heard that day that I think will stand alone as an interesting statement:  "Fred's always dickin' around with lunch meat." Dave Hill

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life" [See 11/01]  So I'm going on a road trip, coming up last Friday. [See 11/01] And I driving my good buddy Dave for ten hours. Dave is one of many people who do not trust my directional skills, which is a shame; I unconsciously take scenic routes, probably led by a Higher Power for reasons mere mortals cannot explain, but all I hear from my passengers is: "We're not lost again, are we?" We always get there, and usually within a close approximation of being On Time. I don't see the problem. And I just know that the first turn I make, Dave will yell about something: about how I took it too fast; about how I was supposed to go left, not right; about how I almost hit that Kid On A Bike; how I am going to hit that car in front of me; and the ubiquitous "Who taught you to drive?" Silly crabs, trips are for Freds!

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life" [See 11/01]  Hi again. On Thursday I decided to break out the ol' pile of sweaters put away since last year. I did this because it's cold, of course. And with that sentence I have driven my post into a brick wall.  So anyway, I wanted to wear one of the sweaters that day. Since it was put away so long, however, there was a big crease from where it was folded. I was going to take a shower anyway, so I put it on a hangar in the bathroom. Water running, I tried to think of ways to bring more steam into the room. Hmm. Well, I could close the door. HAHAHAHA! Just kidding. But I did close the door of the Closet in the bathroom; that helped. What else would concentrate the steam towards the sweater? I ended up bring several larger items, such as my me-sized clothes hamper into the room, so as to take up more space, pushing the steam--hopefully--nearer the area of my sweater.  All of my extra planning took about 20 minutes, and by that time there was barely any hot water to take a shower with. So that was schwag. Also, the crease never came out. Schwag again. Finally, no one noticed the crease. Bonus. See, entropy means a happy ending!

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life"  Well I'm going on a little trip tomorrow and since I won't post any fantastic updates about my important life in the next few days, I figured I could just do it now. Also, I am here in the computer lab waiting for something to finish printing, so what else am I supposed to do? The printer here is one of those older ones that use the long, attached pieces of paper with the holes on both sides. Yeah, the cheap stuff. Teachers won't accept them so that's why I can print out half a ream for free. Looking at it now, however, I realize that I can barely read half of the font. You know how some people spell "encyclopedia" with that conjoined "AE" thing? All of the letters on the page look like that. And the numbers? Don't even ask. Like a just scanned some kindergardener's glitter art.

      Been awake now for a long time, but actual, factual data on that will require subtraction, something I’m not yet in the mood for…1:15 PM EST, so I’ve been up for 27.25 hours. There. Writing this on a train from Bielefield (sp?) to Berlin with a broken dinner tray—excuse the poorer handwriting. The flight in got a little bumpy but overall it was great—even got a free continental breakfast! It was plenty better than that reheated chicken hide or whatever for dessert. Anyway, Deusseldorf International is awful quiet at 7 AM. Haven’t seen the sun yet; maybe I will in the morning. Ed Jr. has confused everyone by doing errands while he tries to show us around the place. We went to the bank like 4 times today, for example. And speaking of the bank, and of subtraction, my debit card does not work here; dangit. We were able to go to the bank and get 100 bucks out of a credit card but we tried to pay for a hotel with it and it got denied. Don’t know what that means, exactly; will have to make a few meaningless phone calls. Since I can barely keep conscience [sic] I better go before I go comatose.

      $7 for a battery? A battery? This trip is already expensive. I wonder how many surcharges my credit card will tack on when I’m buying waffles in Belgium. Anyho, the trip will start in about 1 hour when I start taking my Dramamine. Actually, it’s the generic, Wal-Mart Dramamine that comes in packs of 100, instead of 8. 8? I’ve got more traveling than that to do! H*ck, I was feeling a little queasy on the ride here…So in this next hour I have to find something to do:  1) The Landmark Bar, right across the hall. Dressed up in that Art Decoish, Frank Lloyd Wrightish stuff. I feel like getting’ me a sandwich.  2) GAMEBOY ADVANCE! Just got it for Christmas yesterday. Now I bought 3 more games on the way here! There is no way I’m going to have a boring flight, not with Donkey Kong, Tony Hawk and good ol’ Gradius to keep me company. And sure, I could talk to Joe as well, but Joe is, well, kind of a tool. Good thing I bought lots of batteries.

      CD: Weezer, compilation CD  This is it, and yes, Jeff, I'm writing a weblog a day ahead again. Tomorrow I'm leaving for Europe for two weeks and I assuming I die on the way there you'll at least get to look at this and think I had some divine intuition about the whole think. It's been snowing for two days straight anyway, so maybe a plane crash isn't such a far-off idea. But if I'm going to go put myself at risk of death, I'm hoping it'll be while saving my fellow Americans from a crazed terrorist. I've already planned out that if there's a terrorist on board, I'm going to beat him up (to put it mildly). I'm gonna get all Delta Force on him. On the upside, I'll become a hero to America, and make everyone feel better about this great land of ours. On the downside, my friend Joe will probably be next to me on the plane, sleeping the whole time, and I'll have to explain to him the whole story about how I became an American hero while he snoozed AGAIN during a trip. Alas. So anyway, I'll try to write a trip journal and post it up here when I get back. You'll probably see some pictures as well; have a Happy New Year. (I'll be under the Eiffel Tower when the clock strikes 12:00.)  "This one's for the Constitution! This one's for freedom! And this one's for your friends!" --Me, during the dramatic scene from the future movie depicting me whacking the thwarted terrorist assailant unconscious with his own gun.

      CD: Jimi Hendrix, "Merry Christmas And Happy New Year"  I got a Game Boy! My brother is getting stranger all the time: first, he never has any money, second, he's the only person that bought anyone any Christmas presents this year. He must have collaborated with Dad or Santa Claus or Colin Powell or someone. These aren't cheapo gifts, either; we're talking a Game Boy for me, and a DVD player for Dad, etc., etc. Though I'm happy as h*ck to finally get that Game Boy Advance--I thought this day would never come! I can play Tetris anywhere!--I just had to ask my brother what was up. After watching so many Christmas specials in my life, and going to too many O. Henry plays, it couldn't be true, you know? "So Tim," I asked humbly, "tell me the truth: how long did you have to sell drugs to get all this stuff?" Tim just laughed. Which could mean anything... And Mom got a big candle!

      CD: Beatles, "Past Masters Volume 2"  Rock and roll! Tonight's Christmas Eve service was part revival, part talk show, part Osbournes. Our church is one of the ones with a Praise Band and a big computer projector that can broadcast PowerPoint. Combine this with some decent, practiced segwaying and a few hundred people with candles, and guess what: pyrotechnics. With each song, the lights went down or up depending on the mood. "Everybody get up and let's...!" started a number of songs. During the big finale, the great rock ballad "Silent Night" was sung along to with the Methodist equivalent of lighters. My brother, who avoids church depending on the decade, participated louder than everyone else, clapping louder, singing louder, getting really psyched. "Yeah!" he said to the family sitting in front of him as the lights came down. "Are you ready to rock?!" Ooh, and I love when they do the medley of hits from their Christmas album!  "I haven't been here in years! Whoa, that guy's old now!" --my brother

      CD: Grateful Dead, "Terrapin Station"  Nobody in my family is getting any other member of my family anything for Christmas. Finally, after years of half-hearted giving, we have given up. Well, almost. We may share a dinner or something. And though we don't even have a tree up, we have already watched more Christmas specials on TV this year. I am going to Europe the day after Christmas, so I promised to "bring back stuff;" these poor substitutes for Christmas presents will probably come in the form of mugs and trinkets like miniature Eiffel Towers or little pieces of cheese with the word "Geneva" on it. I dunno. But we told our father about the Greatest Gift of All--a new shower stall for the bathroom--that would suffice as an all-encompassing gift substitute. We went to Home Depot and looked around. So I guess what I really want for Christmas involves plumbing and grout. For some reason, there aren't many Christmas sales at Home Depot....

      CD: Jimi Hendrix Experience, "BBC Sessions"  There isn't much to do here. I've already spent like two hours on the internet, and I've played pinball on the off-hours. Remember "3-D Space Pinball" from your Windows 95 disk? It's still on Windows XP! What a great game. I got to something like six million points today, which is probably my third-best of all time, even when I was using it on Windows 98. It's so dead over here that I've started doing homework for next semester, and am about a hundred pages ahead so far. Mmm...Historical Research Methodology. Just saying it makes one feel envigorated. Besides that, well, I found some chocolate, and opened up a few letters. Three checks came in the mail, woohoo! I guess I could organize my "To Be Filed" file folder, or just go to bed and get that full six hours of sleep. Goodness, I have a pathetic life. Even on my time off work I find ways to suck life out of things. Hey, where'd I put my stampbook?

      CD: Mexican Cession, "Full Color Bitch Slap Attack"  Since school is out and the work has been slow, I've decided to do some spring cleaning early. No one helps. Nevertheless, I pick up other peoples' messes, some of which have been lying around for years. Last night's goal was to be the room just above the stairs, which has unofficially become "storage;" a.k.a. "there's no room to walk in that room." My problem with cleaning, however, is that I'm the worst person to do it. I get so allergic to flying particles of who-knows-what that I go through about fifty Kleenex in an afternoon. Last night, I went to that room above the stairs and turned on the lights. I immediately started hacking, sneezing, and swelling around the eyes. Dang. Twenty-four hours later and I want to jump back in the trenches. This is the part of the movie when one of my platoon buddies goes "But you'll never make it! It's a suicide mission!" and I'll say something in return, like "I've got to avenge my father's death" or something corny like that. Mmm, corn. Maybe I'll eat first; I'm hungry.

      CD: Foo Fighters, "One By One"  Son of a gun. I was going to write about Morning Hair. You know, when you wake up in the morning and your hair is about ten feet up to one side. Today mine was especially cool, as twelve hours of sleep pushed everything to the left side of my head, leaving a monstrous apex about two-thirds of the way over. It was magnificent. I had also gotten a haircut two days ago, so instead of a Rocky Mountain of hair it was more like an Appalachian Mountain of hair. It looked like a Mohawk, like the one Eddie Vedder has been sporting lately. But, NO! I can't write about my hair. Joe beat me to it! What with his new haircut and his Dave Grohl stylist and it's only a coincidence that I was listening to the Foo Fighters last night, it really was! Now no one will believe me; I'm just ripping of Joe's weblog. Son of a gun. Son of a gun.  "It used to be, we couldn't wear sunglasses during an interview; no, no, that would be so rude.

      CD: Meat Puppets, "Meat Puppets II" [enhanced rerelease]  Did you know I'm Spider-Man? Not even I knew my secret identity. During the course of the average day as a substitute teacher, I am inundated by numerous odd questions such as "Do we have to do this?", "Are you married/How old are you?", and my personal favorite, "Are you a REAL teacher?" But most of all, the kids love the fun of celebrity look-a-likes. Keanu Reeves I've heard before. Excellent. Recently I've also heard I look like Jim Carrey, and since Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey don't look anything alike I have no idea what's going through their developing minds. But last week I heard that I looked like Spider-Man. They later clarified that I look like Tobey Maguire, the guy that played Spider-Man in the movie. Whew. That makes much more sense than what I was thinking. "Hmm," I thought to myself, "The Tobey Maguire before he got bit in the lab, or after?" I think I already knew the answer.

      CD: BS 2000, "Simply Mortified"  I am astounded by the quality of parking at the American Automobile Association. Really. First, entering the lot is easy. It's right out in front, and the parking lot has several enterances and exits. The spots are very big, and the lot is also full of large trees making for an almost uncorrupted canopy. There are so many trees around the cars, in fact, that you can barely see the building. How wonderfully car-centric. I think it's good to see an organization that is so dedicated to their line of work...That is, compared to the American Legion, which has its own bar. Would AAA have a bar? I don't think so! I think they have better things to do. Anyway, they're high-class enough to serve champagne instead. Did the troops drink Budweiser as they attacked Pearl Harbor? I don't think so!

      CD: B.B. King and Eric Clapton, “Riding With The King”  DIVINE INTERVENTION OF THE YEAR POST  Someone asked me to go to their church on Sunday night. I told them thank you for asking, but because of work I would miss a good part of the service. Also, I had a radio show that night at three in the morning; I couldn’t do all three things. So I said I’d visit another time when I’m not working weekends anymore. Instead, I went home and set the alarm for 1 AM to get up and be a DJ. Meanwhile, while I slept the snowstorm moved in. They said it’d be something like six inches that night, but why think about something you’re going to miss most of?   So here’s something people like me have to learn about snowstorms in Buffalo: there is an army of men and trucks that get rid of the snow, but they don’t start until about four in the morning. People that want to be somewhere at three, shouldn’t. After getting several inches of snow and freezing rain off my car I set out at 2 AM. Visibility was low and the roads were vacant of travelers. Somewhere outside of Millgrove on Genesee, I lost control of my car, slid to the left and rammed into someone’s mailbox. I never did find the mailbox. Anyway, my car only suffered two small scratches and wasn’t stuck, so I got back in the car and kept going. (I wondered, should I leave a note? And then I realized: where was I going to put it, in their mailbox?)  About three miles later on Genesee, a little past Ransom Road going towards Buffalo, my wheels got caught. I started skidding again, and this time spinning as well. As the scenery spun around I saw an oncoming truck, an awfully close, reinforced road sign (the kind with two metal posts, not one), then my own skid marks, and then the snowbank stopped me. I thought, “Huh.” The truck that saw it happen stopped, and he had a cell phone; I called my father to say I ran off the road, that I’d probably be all right but that he might want to come down just in case. As the guy drove off I then I got out of the car to look at the damage. There was none. None. Underneath my back passenger tire, however...another mailbox. I propped it up against the reinforced road sign and pulled out my shovel.   I was able to dig myself out quite easily and it wasn’t hard to decide I was going to turn around and go back home–the car was already pointed in that direction anyway, so the car decided for me. I waited half an hour for my father, then decided he was either going 22 miles an hour or got into an accident myself. Of course, one minute later he came down the road the opposite direction from me. And, of course, he didn’t notice me. That meant I had to go follow him, hazard lights blinking and horn honking. I caught up to him and he still didn’t notice me. Eventually I had to try and pass him in zero visibility to get his attention and make him turn around. I caught him another two or three miles down from where I hit the second mailbox. By now it was 4:30 in the morning, and the snow plows had passed by me, clearing my way home.   So in retrospect, here’s what happened: I got in two accidents with little more than a scratch. The only other person on the road in twenty minutes just happened to see my last accident and also happened to have a phone the second I needed it. If I had spun off the road two seconds before I did, I would have hit a sign that could of done serious damage to my car; five seconds later, and I would have hit the truck that helped me. And when I finally got a hold of my dad to end my little adventure, where was I? Right across the street from the entrance to the LoveJoy Gospel Church, where I was asked to attend just hours before. Coincidence? And the CD that just happened to be in my rotation on the ride back? The one listed above: B.B. King and Eric Clapton’s “Riding With The King.” The King of Kings, folks; ‘tis the season!   F: “Jerry?” J: “Yeah.” F: “Um, I’m here on Genesee. I, uh, I’m off the road.” J:   “GREAT.”

      CD: Johnny Cash, "Orange Blossom Special"  Christmas is coming, and I've finally solved the great Christmas mystery. No, it's not where Baby Jesus was born, or how Santa gets down the chimney. I'm talking about socks. Every year myself and my siblings would get socks by the dozens, and by Christmas the next year, we would all be out of socks again! How does it happen? I found the answer. First, my siblings would never pick up their socks. I would, and throw them into a large box marked "clothes." Then, they would take MY socks, and I would vicariously put them in the "clothes" box. Each year I would fill a new box. This year, I opened all the boxes to see what I could give to Goodwill, and you know what I found? One pairs of danged socks, that's what! White ones, ribbed ones, elastic ones, white ones, reinforced toe ones, white ones, tubed ones, white ones, crew ones, and white ones. Ever sort one hundred pairs of socks! It's a rush! Whoo! Get back! Hurt myself!  "Dude, you look weird." --one longtime friend to another, after walking into a room

      CD: Eminem, "The Eminem Show"  I was watching Fox News, which I don't recommend, and "news" about Christmas at the White House came up. There was Mrs. Bush with bunch of kids near a tree, and the kids were asking questions about the White House, but mostly about how Santa gets in and out of the White House. She said there were a lot of big chimneys, or something like that; anyway, she said she really didn't know. And THEN the camera panned over and there was jolly ol' Saint Nick himself. So c'mon kids, just ask the man! You can do it! And come to think about it, if you were three or four years old, who would you want to talk to, Santa or the First Lady? Darn right! This was most definitely a photo op without common sense. Another way you could tell the whole thing was scripted was by the kids' questions. If you're in a room with 20 little kids and you ask them if they have any questions, fully eight of them will not know the definition of "question." One will try to tell a story about how they have a dog, and yesterday that dog was caught eating that night's meatloaf and their mom got mad and hit the dog with a newspaper and made it go outside. Then another kid will sit in the corner sucking their thumb. Within fifteen minutes, three will have to go to the bathroom, or will go without getting up. Someone will cry. But here at the White House? Every kid sits patiently, waiting for their turn to talk. Well, maybe they've been the really, REALLY Good Kids.   "F*** YOU LYNN CHENEY!

Once again, for another 2 hours, looking for those Windows 98 modem drivers my computer somehow "lost." Mind you, I'm trying to hook up an Ethernet connection with the thing, and why it needs modem drivers is apparantly not my business.  A nice walk to the bank to pick up my seventeen dollars! My, what brisk weather!  My laundry mission continues. I am washing every stray piece of clothes in the house; unclaimed articles will be devoted to the Salvation Army. I'm on my 15th load right now.  Called AAA about buying train tickets in the Netherlands. Surprisingly, they knew what I was talking about.

Today I fought the law, and the law won. But I still succeeded! I cleaned that pesky room, or at least put everything in that room in a manageable place (empty closets are wonderful). Meanwhile, the entire time I was doing this I sneezed and dripped and lost more bodily fluids than I can remember ever intaking within the last two days. So I went to dinner suffering with a sporadic bloody nose; so what? What surprises me more is not the level of the inevitable but the discoveries uncovered. Like, I had no idea we kept enough styrofoam in that room to fill an oil drum. Or enough cardboard products to, well, fill up another oil drum. So I'd like to invite everyone over to an oil drum fire at my place. We'll be making s'mores, dude. You gotta come if there are s'mores!

      CD: Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, "Now I Got Worry"  Laptop computers are beautiful things. Today I slept for a full TWELVE hours today. The past few days I have either been writing papers all day, or getting up at ghastly pre-sun times to go to work, or this nasty pain in my back--no, not Al Gore--has kept me in a stationary position. Long story short, I wake up like an hour and a half ago but I'm still not OUT OF BED! I've checked my E-mails, read the news, listened to music, written letters, talked with friends, had a couple laughs, looked at a few message boards...and I haven't even sat up yet! Granted, when I finally DO sit up it will be extremely painful, but think of all the possibilities! I could be the next Howard Hugues! Heck, I could be the next--um, you know, that physicist guy in the wheelchair! Awesome! That physicist guy in the wheelchair was once on Star Trek!  "And after our perfect day, we could go to the movies, we could...get a hot dog....Have you ever had a hot dog, baby? With onions, and saurkraut?" --Jon Spencer Blues Explosion

      CD: Red Hot Chili Peppers, "Mother's Milk"  A couple of nights ago I bent down to get into my car (because I drive a Cavalier, gall dang!) and something in my neck went "crack." Not a loud, angry crack, like Marion Barry, but kind of a "crik." I might have said something like "huh" or a real small "ow" but I really wasn't worried. Then it hurt to raise my head. Then it hurt to move my head left and right. Then I had to roll over every time I wanted to stand up because if I didn't it would feel like someone had just jammed a sword down my spinal column. Though it's slowly wearing off, at its peak the entire top half of my back, my shoulders, my neck and head were incapable of moving anywhere without me going "a a a aaaahhhhHHHHHH!" "Ow." "Aw ahhhw ow!" and then I would gasp for air, though I still have no idea why, since I couldn't do anything less physical than lying prostrate on my bed.   "Sorry Fred, I Kid! I Kid! I Kid cause I love!" --Ed Snyder

      CD: Queens of the Stone Age, "Songs For the Deaf"  Nothing says "I'm an old man now" like getting up at 5:30 in the morning, putting on some dress clothes and going out to breakfast. Firstoff, I didn't even know restaurants were open that early. Second, where did all these people come from? They're older, of course (I went with my father), but even though they've still got to go to work right after they eat they aren't rushed, they take their time eating, they make conversation with the waitress, they read the paper real slow, they say hi to the other two or three people they know in the diner, they sip their coffee every minute or so and even have time for a few refills. Freaks! You can drink coffee while you drive, you know, and there's NPR if you want to stay informed. These people pretend like they have nothing to do! I wonder how they act after work, when there really IS nothing to do. All the relaxing stuff has already been done! Crazy.  "Hey, how's your drivetime commute? What's the SAGA. I need a saga! It's Songs for the Deaf. You can't even hear it!" --Queens of the Stone Age

      CD: Blur, "Parklife"  For shizzle my nizzle! So I was watching the show "Rock The House" on VH1 the other day, which is another cheesy attempt by the music industry to cash in on one of its twenty or so profitable acts... anyway, the idea behind the show is that a music star redecorates a fan's house without them knowing, and then the fan comes home and gets all shocked and stuff and then meets the artist and is all shocked and stuff and they love the house and they get a free Sony Flatscreen TV and everyone lives happily ever after. But Snoop...I'm worried about Snoop Dogg. He redecorated a girl's house, but during everything he did, he spoke with that "izzle" talk only he seems to use and understand. "I gotta mizzle my tizzle for shizzle cuz my heezy weezy! A Lizzle my nizzle!" Wuh? I used to think he might have learned this think during his stint in prison. Since phone conversations are taped in jail, I could he him and other prisoners using the "izzle" stuff so nothing they say could ever be used in court. But now i'm pretty sure he's making the crap up as he goes along. No one talks like that unless they're either too rich to care about reality or they're mentally retarded. Then again, Snoop did say he was giving up marijuana because it "makes you stupid." Yep.  He [Bush] recalled the last time he was in Florida, on the morning of Sept. 11, and what went through his mind when the first plane hit New York's World Trade Center: "I used to fly myself, and I said, 'Well, there's one terrible pilot.'" --Associated Press, Dec. 4, 2001

      CD: Sleater-Kinney, "One Beat"  I give up. Since I started doing this weblog thing I've been putting the CD I'm listening to (or listened to that day) up on the top of each post. Well, at the beginning it was easy; in the summer I had time to listen to like five albums a day while I read, drove, or painted the trim on the house. With school starting, however, I narrowed it down to about 2-3 albums. Now it's final exam time, and I just don't have the energy. Not even the energy, it appears, to get up and change the CDs in my player. So if you analyse all of my posts from the start, you will see the first fifty days with fifty different CDs, then the next fifty with a few repeats (Natalie Imbruglia! Yay!) and now, well, it's like listening to my own personal version of KISS 98.5. Sorry, kids. But seriously, Sleater-Kinney made a kick-arse record this year. Dig!  "I have very mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I’m concerned that the rampant downloading of my copyright-protected material over the Internet is severely eating into my album sales and having a decidedly adverse effect on my career. On the other hand, I can get all the Metallica songs I want for FREE! WOW!!!!!" --"Weird Al" Yankovich, on Napster   Edited by: TomServo0 at: 12/7/02 9:21:34 pm

      CD: Danko Jones, "Born A Lion"  It's coming! I bought me a brand new laptop--dude, it's a Dell!--online last week. Making the anticipation even tougher to deal with is that wonderful technological advancement known as the UPS Shipment Tracking system, which can tell me all the little stops my laptop is making on it's journey to my house. It's an adventure, just like on that show Belle and Sebastian! Remember, the cartoon about the little boy and his dog that took like 64 episodes to get home? Now my little laptop is in the UPS center in Buffalo (as of 10:40 PM last night) all alone, cold, shivering in the back of some brown, windowless truck. I hope it's doing alright. I wonder what it's thinking... Somewhere, out there/beneath the pale moonlight...

      CD: Cee-Lo, "Cee-Lo Green And His Perfect Imperfections"  Over the past few years I would come home from breaks at school, and the house would be extremely messy. Of particular distress was the amount of peoples' clothes on the floor; sometimes washed, sometimes folded or in a hamper, but sometimes not, these clothes would be kicked around, tripped over, and otherwise unclaimed by anyone. And during each of my breaks I would pick up these clothes, put them in a large cardboard box, and tell everyone that if they didn't claim anything in the box it would go to Goodwill. Like I said, years have passed. There are now so many boxes of clothes that they take up a pile, ceiling-high, covering half of the laundry room. I am now in the process of washing all of these clothes. They will be sorted and put on tables, GAP-style, with signs proclaiming "CHRISTMAS CLEARANCE! EVERYTHING MUST GO!" In a psychological kuo, I'm think of charging rock-bottom, warehouse prices for these things I don't own. We'll see what happens.  "If the Good Lord strikes me down tonight, and I still haven't found my true love, I'm gonna die a happy man!" --a somewhat jaded Danko Jones

      CD: The Apples In Stereo, "Her Wallpaper Reverie"  Someone recently wrote in an inferior weblog (it was you, Joe!) that they could not decide was good music was anymore. Strangely enough, they asked me for advice. During college, my roommates warned other people that my taste in music was deplorable and probably, since I listened to anything I could get for cheap, nonexistent. The problem is compounded when a young adult, as the male psyche switches from preferring mindless, ear-shattering crap rock (your Limp Bizkits and Korns) to preferring mindless, sleep-inducing acoustic pop (your Travises and Dave Matthews Bands).   What is good music now? If it gets your attention and keeps it, that's a good start. Danko Jones is a good example of that; you can't get bored with it nomatter what you do. Outkast, Har Mar Superstar, Foo Fighters can usually do this. But also consider the work of The Neptunes, who have done work with Britney Spears, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Mystical, as well as their own N.E.R.D. project. Try them out. The Flaming Lips are also doing things that haven't been heard before.   Depending on your mood, maybe you shouldn't listen to music. Get into some older music; jazz like Count Basie, Horace Silver or Dick Hyman. Folk like Ledbelly or Memphis Minnie. The best thing you can do is to go to the public library and find the most obscure-looking, dust-encrusted albums they have. Sounds of the Ancient Incas, for example. Hungarian polkas. And then, if you still don't like music, play two records together and see what happens. My friend Dave and I found a great album that remixed traditional sounds of the culture of Mali with a broken melodica. Either way, stop looking for music and start listening to it....  www.amazon.com/exec/obido...24-4878443  "Hey, the McRib is back!" --Jack Osbourne

      CD: Stevie Wonder, "Songs In The Key Of Life"  The shining moment of my Graduate school career thus far (other than the "Shaft" tribute on my radio show a few weeks ago) must be the thesis proposal handed in this Tuesday. Granted, it is probably not that good. It will probably just get a B because I handed it in on time (Education majors can't get lower than a B [I hope] as long as they pay their tuition bill on time). Why so proud of it, you ask? Well, I had all semester to write this twenty-page paper, and did not write a word until the day it was due. I got up at 6:00 AM (I was going to get up at 5 but you know how it is) sat down and churned out not twenty, but THIRTY-TWO pages of text in ten hours. How 'bout them apples? Eh? That includes a bibliography, people!   On a final note, I'd like to thank this weblog for teaching me how to pull words out of my nose at the last minute. And the Academy....   Shaft's woman: "I love you." Shaft: "Yeah, I know...take it easy."

      CD: Dandy Warhols, "Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia"  Tonight the snow was so bad you couldn't see twenty feet in front of you. This happens every once in a while here in Buffalo. First, you hear a little something about some snow, then you kind of forget about and go about your daily business. In most other cities the grocery stores are packed with people trying to buy bottled water at this point. Buffalonians, however, are astute. They know that a steady diet of chicken wings, pizza and the occasional tailgater's feast insures that their body can go three, four days without nourishment. Being trapped in your house for half a week--which happens once a year now--is no problem as long as you have cable. But there was one strange thing I saw that grabbed my attention on the way home. Through the cloud of swirling snow I spotted a man running across the intersection of Main and Salt wearing nothing more than jogging shorts. No shirt, no shoes, no s***! It's 20 degrees outside and there's eight inches of snow! That must be one heck of a frat.

      CD: various, "OzzFest 2001 Summer Sampler"  Somehow, I'm going to give two important presentations and write two papers in four days. This doesn't mean that I've done any real prep work yet; yes, I do have all the materials on hand, but no, I haven't put one word down. I also have to work during those days, as well as a few other things including a heck of a long stay a Kinko's; we'll see how that works out. Thank goodness for 24-hour Kinko's! Who is Mr. Kinko anyway? What kind of name is Kinko? Is it anything like Chi-chi's? It was a sad day when they closed Chi-Chi's around here. I only went once, though, with my 7th Grade Home Economics class. Why, I don't know, but it involved free samples so I won't complain. Do you ever look back at your grade school field trips and wonder why you took them? I do, and I have no idea why I went to the zoo, museum, etc. Kind of like this post...I wrote it without knowing what today's "theme" would be, and now I'm done. And it even has a theme! Kinky!  “Corporation: An ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility.” --Ambrose Bierce

      CD: Portishead, "Portishead"  Credit cards are scary. Scarier are credit cards mixed with internet shopping. It's waaaay too easy. So I sit there in my pajamas, looking at my card, looking at the screen, looking at the price, looking back at my card, looking at the clock, checking my mail, looking back at the price, looking at the card again, looking at the button that says BUY IT! and thinking, "Aw man. This is too easy. This isn't right." I had to bring someone into the room and ask them if I should go through with it. "Yeah! Go for it!" they said. Somehow that made me feel worse, but I don't know why. "Free Shipping!" is tempting, yet that BUY IT! button reminds me of Stimpy's "History Eraser" button. Remember that one? The big, shiny, candy-colored button that just HAD to be pushed? It erased all of history, dude! That's freaky!  "Ding dongs, man! Ding dongs! Ding dongs, yo!" --video for Weird "Al" Yankovich's "Fat"

      CD: Cucumber + Ginseng, "El Presidente 2: Thology"  So Jeff and I were discussing the show "Inside the Actors Studio" and the part at the end where they ask the actor those Bernard Pivot Questionnaire. The last question is always: "If Heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?" I misread it and though it was "What would YOU say when..." But we both agreed that the least inspired answers came with this question. Always something cheesy and humorless. So he brainstormed the real question while I took the dead guy's point of view... Here's some of what I came up with.  Q. If Heaven exists, what would you say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?  "This is already better than the 'Taxes'."  "You mean I'm never going to see my wife again?"  "I seek the Grail."  "Hey! You're just James Earl Jones behind a curtain!"  "Will I have to live next to Italians?"  "Hell yeah, I'm in! Rock on! (makes devil horns with hand)"  "So the Jehovah's Witnesses knock on your door too, huh?"  "What's the meaning of li... oh, now I remember. Never mind."  "It smells like couscous up here."  "So you tell us to build our faith on a foundation of solid rock, but then you built the Kingdom of Heaven on this CLOUD?"    "Now look, sir. I may be just po' country folk, but I know that back in Kansas we got long hard days on the dirt farm, bland food, and boring children. But we're a community, gall-dungit. A good one, with good people. And no, God, it don't matter how much influence you may have got o'er the universe, or what power you have o'er life and death, or what any of your fancy "Commandments" say, you're not going to take a God-faring American man and his family from the farm they've worked for four generations to save and move them away to some 'Heaven' place just like that! Not today, not ever!"   So yeah, we were really bored tonight.

      CD: Cucumber + Ginseng, "El Presidente: Anthology"  The group Cucumber + Ginseng has rocked audiences around the world, but that is nothing compared to what they will do next. With the world at their oyster, record sales in the teens, and live shows that--literally--shocked their neighbors, C + G took an unpublicized long-term break from the music business. Dave "Dio" Hill has built a second cult following in his side band, "Tops Markets." Joe "Licks" Ferguson just performed at the world-famous Grand Old Opry in Nashville, only to be kicked out for being too "Rock & Roll." Frederick Charles Thomas "John Paul Jones" Schrock has taken up award-winning photography and hosts the popular game show "Name That Smell." Well guess what. The band has reunited with a new member, Tim "Novice" Schrock on drums, a new name, The Squeaky Divas, and a new mission: To rocK with a capital K. Because K is a really tough consonant.

      CD: Soundgarden, "Down On The Upside"  Right now I am looking at my Gorby Dolls. Actually I guess they would be called Yeltsin Dolls but I've wanted a set for a long, long, time. You know those Russian wooden people witht the people inside, and when you open up one you get a smaller one and a smaller one, et cetera? They also come in a "Leaders of Russia" set. You got your Yeltsin, Gorbachev, Brezhnev, Kruschev, (sp?) Stalin, Lenin, and I think that's Czar Nicholas II in the very center, or just maybe they made Karl Marx instead. It's not up-to-date--no Putin--but hey, i's got all the Communists I need! I got it in East Berlin anyway so I wasn't expecting full modernization of doll technology anyway. But here's the Catch-22: You can't fully enjoy them unless you take them out and display them simultaneously, but the only way to have real fun with them is to keep them inside the big one to play with them later! What's an American to do?

      CD: MC5, "Kick Out The Jams"  People still don't get it. After almost five days of barely speaking because of strep throat, people are still calling at me from opposite ends of the building and expecting to hear me yell something back. "WHO IS THE PHONE FOR?!" is probably the most frequent utterance. Well, I can write it down for you, or I could completely ignore you if the phone isn't for you. And since I'm running a fever and am really not in the mood to entertain such trivialities, I think I'll just lie here and let you keep yelling! In fact, what am I answering the phone for anyway, you lazy bum?! The best I can usually get out is a raspy, "Hall- -hallo?" These past few days of near silence has given me a greater appreciation for Actual Silence; maybe by the end of the week I will discover it, too.

      CD: Queens Of The Stone Age, “Songs For The Deaf”  I took 26 rolls of film in Europe. About 8 pictures came out well. First, I turned them into the good, unpaid and ununionized folks at Wal-Mart, which required that I fill out 26 of those Photo Envelope things. I told the girl I’d be back in “about an hour” which is AN IRONIC TWIST OF FATE completely lost on her. Then she said they’d be ready by Saturday, which they weren’t. So I came back Saturday and they said “That girl CRAY-zee, they’ll be ready on Monday,” which they weren’t. Then I came on Tuesday and yes, they would be ready, but not for two hours. What to do? I looked at the (censored) CD section. I ended up buying a Game Boy game and being quite upset at myself for “wasting my money.” I then bought a Veggietales DVD, and by then my good sense nearly walked. Ninety more minutes. I decided to take a walk outside. I checked out the dollar store and then—ooh!—a discount shoe store. I bought me some sneakers for the first time in 2 ½ years and somehow felt like I accomplished something. One of the most fun ways to spend an hour and a half is “trying out” new shoes, skipping and jumping up and down and basically doing the mating dance of the dodo bird in a back aisle near the storeroom while playing with new toys like shoehorns and ankle stockings. By the way, developing 26 rolls of film costs about $200, give or take a dollar. Just enough left for a set of 20 pencils at the Dollar Tree next door.

      CD: Radiohead, “Amnesiac”  I’m quite proud of the fact that I skipped the Super Bowl for the first time since 1988. Maybe if I stop watching it altogether, the teams I want to win will actually do so…Nobody talks about the game the next day anyway; they only want to talk about the commercials. But since I didn’t watch the Super Bowl, here are some other commercials I like (see how I’m scraping for blog subjects?):  -“WHERE’S THE BEEF?!” Still the best.  -The one where the guy is sniffling, sneezing, headache, cough, etc. That guy looks like crap.  -The Hose Roller thing where the “Other Guy” keeps fumbling with his hose, eventually dropping it, whereas the lady next to him has that Hose Roller thing and can do it with one hand. Note how the guy also has an untucked shirt and ratty hair. He just can’t keep ANYTHING together!  -I miss the Pets.com dog.  -You know, the one where the mother in the family is all happy to be doing the laundry or the dishes or making breakfast that no one has time to sit down and eat? But thank goodness she spent X dollars on the brand name version of X that somehow makes banal chores like cleaning up after, feeding, and washing her family (something they should really learn how to do by themselves) just plain magical. Remember that one? As magical as dancing stuffed teddy bears, floors with animated bald men looking at you through their shine, or flying cereal bowls that metamorphose into granola bars mid-flight. Hey mom, whatever keeps you off the Vicadin.   -Sign up for the Army, get a free pair of socks!

      CD: Beastie Boys, “Check Your Head”  School has only been going on for a week but I’ve already noticed some trends. In one class, the professor felt it necessary to warn us about the courseload; he wants us to know as soon as possible that readings of up to 75 pages per week will be assigned. Gee, I know this is Grad School, but why is he demanding so much of us? Seventy-five pages might take over an HOUR to read!! In another class, I told the teacher in her office that I had Strep Throat and probably should meet her at another time (it’s an Independent Study Course) and then noticed she had been smoking and drinking coffee for the past hour and had a hoarser voice than me. I didn’t feel so bad then. A third teacher was impressed that I was the only one who had taken the cellophane off the textbook. I told him Chapter 9 looked pretty interesting, to which he replied “Oh yes, that’s written by a very good author.” Nobody else in the room knew that he was the author… Umm… there was one more class. AH HA! The guy with the accent. Very bright and entertaining, but he writes with his left hand like it’s his left hand, y’know? The text slopes upward at about a 55 degree angle. It’s a Arab studies course, so I’m assuming that writing English for him really IS writing backwards. And that wuz me furst wik at skool.

      CD: Liz Phair, “Exile In Guyville”  When Donald Rumsfield said that France and Germany were the “Old Europe” and didn’t know what they were talking about when it came to the War on Terror, he shows he apparently hasn’t been to Berlin. I don’t think half those buildings are more than twenty years old. Not to mention their parliament building has only been in use since 1999. And as for terrorism, I think the Germans know darn well what a terrorist regime is! Dang! Who hired this guy? And isn’t this the wiener we have a picture of shaking hands with Saddam Hussein in the 1980s? EWW. Those are cooties of the highest order! Did you wash your hands, Donald? Because you’re not getting dinner until you wash your hands! And take off your shoes, they’re all mudd…DON’T SLAM THE SCREEN DOOR! How many times do we have to tell you?

      CD: Outkast, “Stankonia”  Today I went to the doctor and for the first time in over five years I didn’t have to take off my pants! Whoo-hoo! It’s about time, cuz that lady must be bored of me by now. (That poor receptionist…  Just kidding.) For some reason my REAL doctor is either too busy to see me or I’m just not bleeding enough for him to be interested, so they send me to the nurse practitioner. Last year I busted up my knee, and had to take off my pants for her to look at it. She had some weird system where she gave me one of those paper blanket things to put on my lap, but she also needed me to lift my leg and twist it around…it was inevitable that she see my underwear. But hey--I’m an adult, you’re a doctor—and they’re boxers! Not a problem! Before that, I came in for my college physical, and, well I’ll leave the details of that to myself. So it was really great that I could walk into that room and hear “Fred, nice to see you!” instead of the regular “Drop ‘em.” Or whatever the medical term is.

      01 22 03 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CD: Alicia Keys, “Songs In A Minor”  I can’t speak. Some weird throat infection has taken control and all I can mutter out is a painful cough once in a while. Ironically, once you get a throat infection you have to do more talking. You have to explain to people you meet that you can’t talk because of your throat infection. You have to call in to work and explain to them that you can’t go in today because of your throat infection. You have to call the doctor and tell the receptionist that you have a throat infection and you need to set up an appointment. Your friends call and want to know what you’re up to and you strain to tell them that you’re doing nothing because you have a throat infection and you can’t do anything later. And, of course, there are the jerks that keep asking you, “Hey, is your throat feeling any better?” from the other side of the apartment and expect you to yell back “No, I still can’t talk!” at the top of your lungs. I gotta go make some calls now.

      CD: The Strokes, “This Is It”  There is a house on Main Street that was abandoned a few years ago. It was pretty downtrodden and finally the property was sold—so I hear—to put up a new Dunkin’ Donuts (YES!). So the building was torn down last fall. Its remains sit there still, covered in several inches of snow. Apparently, but not shockingly, that’s illegal. The big bad town of Newstead is trying to bring the owners to task for getting rid of the debris. The weekly Akron Bugle seems confused, however. Sure, what’s left still legally a “building,” but it’s like they don’t know that WE know it’s really a pile. This week’s paper reiterates that “Owners of the property will have an opportunity to appear in person and provide evidence that the property is not in violation of the provisions of the Unsafe Building Law during the hearing.” Good luck, guys! It also outlines what the Unsafe Building Law STATES, like we need to know that? I was originally going to list all 12 possible violations of this “building,” but come on. There is no building. The walls and roof are parallel to each other. If you wanted to vacuum the carpet you’d have to rent a forklift. To light a fire in the chimney, you would use the master bedroom as kindling. This is a Late Parrot!

      CD: Presidents Of The United States Of America, “Pure Frosting”  I am “teaching” a study hall right now. There is this one kid—where did he go? Oh, there he is—that just keeps staring at the computers longingly, as if at a picture of a long-lost lover. See, he spent the first ten minutes of the period typing OYOYOYOYOYOYOYOYOYOY into the computer and turning on the computer voice to read it to the class. So we kicked him off. When it comes to computers in school, kids don’t think to themselves, “Yay, research!” It’s more like, “Darrr, com-pyoo-trz r fun!” and their brains stop. Computers are an excuse to NOT do work; four years in a wired dorm has taught me that lesson well. Now he sits in the back muttering “Now I’m so borrrrrrrrred.” Aw.

      CD: Radiohead, “I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings”  The dentist is all proud of me and stuff. I hadn’t been there since—lemme think—August 13, 1996, but man, he took one look at my pearlies and was like “Wow, you’ve really kept up your teeth; what’s your secret?” Well, Dr. Dentist, it’s ancient and Chinese. Actually, it’s because I didn’t follow doctor’s orders. Once he told me that it looked like I had weak gums and should switch to a soft-bristled toothbrush. Then I did, and when I went back he said the exact same thing. Forget that! So last year I decided to go for it and bought myself a MEDIUM strength brush. I bleed every once in a while, but it’s worth it! That’s my secret: I don’t go to the dentist and I don’t listen to a word he says!

      CD: Bikini Kill, "The C.D. Version of the First Two Records"  Today I spent 2-3 hours with the good folks at Dell trying to figure out why my laptop has suddenly gained the ability to disable every telephone in my house. Somehow, whenever I plug a cord into my modem our number loses its ringtone. Now I have to wait a week to get a new modem sent to me. It also means that I will be subjected to sitting up when I use the Internet, an act that, once you're given the option of lying down and take it, is something you hate to go back to. Therefore, since I am lazy and have also just written ten pages on what I did on my winter vacation, This is a perfect excuse for me to stop doing daily blah blah blogs for a while; about a week to be exact (I hope) before I get the computer fixed. I will also take this chance to officially retire the Daily Quote because it just makes this post thing that much harder to write. I'm still surprised people read this stuff, anyway! Maybe I'll try some new things this year, like rhyming what I right, if I can get my timing right. But if the Dell folks spoke correctly, I'll go right back to my writing directly.

      BERLIN   So what I remember learning today is that the Germans are really, really, really sorry about that whole Holocaust/World War II thing. They can’t apologize for that enough. One large city block is cleared to be a memorial for all murdered Jews. Just flat land. Very depressing. Ate a Berliner (a jelly doughnut, not a citizen) and it was okay; Ed Jr. wanted to stop at a Dunkin Donuts for breakfast which really says “native foods,” don’t you think? What else do I remember? Well, they’re still cleaning up from the war. There are still bombed-out buildings hanging out, especially in the East. The Checkpoint Charlie Museum is filled mostly with old warning signs that told all the Germans that their country was split in half. They all start with “Achtung!” and then they say something like “Do not cross the river under penalty of death” or “Have proper identification ready” or “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up.” You know, stuff that people would yell under stress if they had to. In East Berlin I bought me one of those wooden Russian dolls that you can open up and find a smaller doll inside. Neat! I always wanted one of those! This one is of Soviet leaders, from Yeltsin all the way down to Lenin and I think Karl Marx, but it’s too small to tell. So far my impressions of German folks are good. Their trains run right on time, which means they’re just like Buffalo’s subway except it works and it takes you somewhere. At the Reichstag (German Parliament building), the placards try to make abundantly clear that “The sham government of the Third Reich never held session inside our government headquarters.” It’s like Okay, guys, we’ve all moved on now! But everyone remembers when the Berlin Wall fell, and there’s a line through the city marking where it was. It’s an odd photo opp, especially as you try to take pictures of it in a busy intersection. Maybe it’s their way of getting the last Americans out of the country.        AMSTERDAM   You know, if you don’t smoke pot, like hookers, or own a bicycle, Amsterdam’s probably not for you. But we tolerated it for a few days. The first thing I remember is the bike garage, which must have had something like 7000 of the things on three levels. What I want to know is, how do these people get from their house to the bike garage? Anyway, I had the pannekoken. There’s the Beastie Boys lyric that says “When I’m in Holland, I eat the pannekoken,” and I always thought that referred (no pun intended) to marijuana. How foolish of me—they’re pancakes. And you roll weed in them. I’m just kidding. But speaking of drugs, we were walking down the street when Joe just kind of blurts out “Hey, as long as we’re here, why don’t we buy some crack?” Two seconds later, a guy walks up to Joe and asks him, “You’re looking for crack?” “No, I was only kidding.” “Are you sure?” “I WAS MAKING A JOKE.” He was very nice for a drug dealer, though. I actually felt bad for Joe because he really wanted to go to the Van Gogh museum but we didn’t have the time. We did make the time for the Anne Frank House, however, and it was a total waste. So these people hid in the attic, right? And fifty years later, someone thinks “Hey, I can make some money off of this,” puts up a couple of guardrails and wham, charges people like $6.50 to look at an empty attic. Whoo. And it brings in people by the droves; they line up down the street to see Anne Frank’s wallpaper. What else? You can’t take pictures in the Red Light District, but for the most part you probably don’t want to. And because property taxes used to be based on how much ground your house covered, all the buildings are really thin and high (in altitude, not under the influence). In order to get furniture upstairs they use a rope-and-pulley system outside, and so the furniture doesn’t hit the wall on the way up the building actually comes out towards the street as it goes up. So every building looks like it’s going to fall on you. That really makes me fell bad for the people walking around on mushrooms…dude.       PARIS   Paris on New Year’s Eve is nothing like Dick Clark does. First and most disappointing, there’s no big clock. People just sort of collectively decide when it turns into the next year, so it is midnight from about 11:30 to 12:30 in the morning. Second, the use of such explosives in New York City would probably get you deported. Paris doesn’t have a fireworks display, but the Parisian citizens compensate by bringing whatever sparklers, M-80s, rockets, or scud missiles they’ve been storing up for the last twelve months. And I’m only kidding about the scud missiles. Under the Eiffel Tower is Ground Zero, and anyone down there has to prepare to dodge everything thrown at them—purposely. We tried to stay away from the action but there were a bunch of kids—Joe and Ed refer to them as Arab terrorists (?) —that would run up to you, light a firecracker in your face, yell “Bonne Annee!” and throw them at you. We did a lot more running that night than we expected to. While trying to leave the area at 12:30, the major road was filled with cars that were scattered in fifty different angles—there was no use driving, the morons—and drunken revelers danced in between the four lanes of one-way traffic, personal champagne bottles in hand, jumping on car hoods and chasing after random girls to, well, French them. The French really aren’t as rude as people say…wait, yes they are. And I completely forgot that they closed the subway there at 1 AM meaning that 3 million people in the street had to walk home in the cold. THAT’S rude. Especially when the riot police is yelling at you to get back while he closes the metal gate to the station right in front of you. ESPECIALLY when your hotel room is like ten kilometers out of town and you end up walking for the next four hours in the cold. Speaking of subway stops, the ones near the hotel happened to be open, where we found two Anglophone girls about our age trying to find their way to Nation station, meaning they were too drunk, stupid, or both to notice they passed that stop twenty minutes before they actually got off the train. One said they were from “Vancouver,” the other from “Texas.” Yeah, right. You sound like you’re from Michigan State. Anyway, they asked what we thought of New Year’s in Paris and Joe says something like “It was one of the most awesome experiences I’ve ever had,” to which Texas girl says, “I’ve partied harder.” So I feel bad for her, since she could have had a much more exciting time in her Michigan State dorm drinking a 24-pack of Budweiser in front the strobe light she bought at Spencer’s, instead of blowing all her parents’ money on a trip to Europe to get the same effect. The next morning we slept until 1:30, mostly because we needed that five hours of sleep to keep alive. Rockin'.        GENEVA   Switzerland is the only place where we had to exchange our money, from the universally accepted Euros to the lesser known Swiss Francs. Darned Swiss. You know they just joined the UN last year? In their attempt to be completely unbiased and peaceful, they’ve stayed out of the EU. That means one Euro is work like 1.34 Swiss Francs, or some weird computation that’s like measuring time in quarts. Our impression of Switzerland is very good, however, even though the city was on holiday that night and virtually empty. After all, they do have the UN there, and the Red Cross, so they must be decent folks. The Francophones there are polite, and every where you go sells Swiss Army Knives and Toblerones. We went to the church Martin Luther preached at after he was kicked out of Germany—I think that’s what happened—but it was closed. So we went to dinner at Movenpick because it was the only thing open and we sat next to an old lady that spent about an hour and a half picking at her $20 dinner (about 34n3.Q Swiss Francs) until she happily asked for her check. Like she was making a sand castle or something. We found a few statues in around the UN-Red Cross area that looked pretty odd so I made Ed and Joe stand next to them and imitate them while I took incriminating photos. I hope those came out. Did I mention Geneva is in the middle of the Alps? I don’t know how we did it, but we walked uphill the entire day. Even when we were backtracking. Strangely, we never saw the Swiss Army, that is until we got to Rome….        ROME   Rome is nuts. I’m a history major, and I almost went into shock. There are so many historical thingamabobs, or monument whatchamajiggers to commemorate the historical thingamabobs, that we eventually stopped walking around for fear that we’d find more stuff to look at. I wore a light brown, cordoroyish shirt with large breastpockets, where I put my oft-used camera and my daily allowance of five rolls of film. I went trigger-happy for two full days and Ed started calling me Generalissimo Photog, which kind of stuck. We had a tour book that said one of the hostels was called “Fawlty Towers,” coincidentally just like the old British sitcom. Then I found out it was actually based on the British sitcom, so it was even funnier. Then I found out that’s where Ed made our reservations and it was like winning $5 in the lottery! Sweet! The Roman subway has less stops, more people, less seats, more graffiti, less reliability and more sudden brakings than the one in New York City. Rome has the Pinto of subways. Still, whenever you get off, there’s tons of cool stuff! We went exploring around the Coliseum and found a 16th century chapel that was just covered in murals and other interesting artistic endeavors. We found the archaeological remains of a pagan temple and the Circus Maximus within a couple minutes walk. One of the best things was outside the city—the catacombs—and I was happy to have dragged Ed and Joe to it. I don’t feel bad about getting off at the wrong bus stop, or making them walk down a rural road with no shoulder while little Italian cars missed them by inches going about 70 miles an hour, because we got there, right? It’s weird finding a cave that second century Popes were buried in. A Spanish lady who spoke decent English told our Italian tour guide that we should pray and that made all the opened graves seem a bit more homey. Still, the tour guide told us that she once took a group of British folks down there and she hasn’t found them yet. Nuts, I tells ya!        VATICAN CITY   The Vatican is the shiznit. Word. It is the smallest country in the world, but per square mile it is ten times cooler than anything else out there. Even better then Luxembourg. The Vatican is also where I was the least able to get along with, and Generalissimo Photog should apologize to his comrades for acting like a military sergeant as I tried to make time for everything. First off, the country is protected by the Swiss Guard; how cool is that? And you wonder, if the Swiss never fight, are they good? Then again maybe the Catholics hired them because they DON’T want them to fight. Either way they’re armed with axes. Yeah. We took the elevator to the top of St. Peter’s Basilica…well, not exactly the top. That takes you to the rim of the dome, probably the most impressive sight of the entire trip. It’s crazy stepping into that doorway and realizing you’re ten stories up and there is a 300-foot chasm right in front of you. And that chasm, and the dome over it, is covered in gold, mosaics, and Who knows what else. The extra 330 steps to the very top were almost as interesting, as you had to walk up stairs sideways as you went up the side of the dome. I could talk all day about this place. In the Vatican museum, Joe had to walk against traffic for 20 minutes to get back into the Sistine Chapel because he didn’t know “the picture with the two guys almost touching” was in there and he had to see it before we left. There were wall paintings and carvings at every step. Even if the museum were empty it’d be a great museum. And what supposedly remains of St. Peter is underneath the Basilica, in it’s own special room with golden everything and diamond encrusted stuff that nobody can look at except through a window. I’d like to spend another week in the Vatican, just snooping around, trying to sneak into the Pope’s basement, but the Swiss Guards would probably hack me to death. The next time I go I’m going to bring a bunch of postcards with Martin Luther on them, just so I can get them stamped with the Vatican postmark.        AUSTRIA   After two very long days in Rome, it was actually nice to get stuck in a stuffy train car overnight. On the way down from Rome we were put in a sleeper with this Italian guy and his snoring, four-year old son, and some girl named Ja Young, who didn’t say a word the entire time but had a stuffed koala bear attached to her backpack next to the name tag that said “Korea.” Nice people, but too many for a 6 by 6 by 8 cell. So this time Ed tried to make sure no one got in the cabin. He had us shut the door, close the curtains, turn out the lights, and stretch waaaaay out over the seats so it looked like there was no room. But first we had to get rid of three guys from Senegal, or some other country. Their language sounded like a mix of Spanish, French, Swahili (though I’ve never heard Swahili and don’t really know what I’m talking about) and Mooklar, a language I just invented. But they seemed very nice. One they left we put our plan into action and took over the cabin. We slept head to head to head, just like the Beastie Boys’ “Hello Nasty” cover, and talked girl talk all night. At about six or seven in the morning an Austrian border guard—the real freaking military—threw open the door and yelled “PASSPORTS!” Joe and Ed didn’t wake up fast enough to notice, but he was smiling the whole time. It must have been really funny watching Larry, Moe, and Curly fly around leap up from a pile of coats and luggage like startled moles. Bumping into each other for no reason other than we were still dreaming, Joe gave him his ticket, or the first piece of paper he could find, to which the border guard yelled at him again until he figured it out. I had mine but he barely looked at the thing; his smile just got BIGGER. Then he yelled “THANK YOU!” and we never saw him again. So that’s what I remember about our 45 minutes in Austria.        MUNICH   Munich¡¦s a good, hearty town. I think it was Sunday that day, so everything was closed again. We got there about eight or nine in the morning and Ed knew of a nice pub that we could go visit, and since Joe and I didn¡¦t know where we were going (a normal occurrence) we just followed him. The pub makes its own beer, is about five hundred years old and prefers natives to tourists. We forced Joe to drink a liter of beer for breakfast, and Ed already posted about that; it¡¦s as funny as it sounds. ƒº A great part about this tavern was that certain tables had a coat of arms hanging over it. We found out that certain groups of local men claim these tables, and no one else is allowed to sit there. Ever. Their own special beer mugs are kept locked away for when they come. And there a group of them was, 10 AM on a Sunday morning, preparing for a long day of drinking beer. One guy even had a drinking glove so as not to get repetitive stress injuries in his hand. That¡¦s Messed Up. There was a band and everyone was having a pretty good time, but we had to go, especially Joe, who had to pee like nobody¡¦s business. Outside at noon we watched the town clock go off, especially interesting because it¡¦s one of those old ones with little people in them that dance around every hour. About fifty people came out to watch it, and it was interesting for a full two minutes; good thing we ran out there in the blistering cold to go see THAT. I can¡¦t really remember anything else about Munich; Joe was drunk enough for all of us. Now where did we go next?       COLOGNE   Ed really hyped up the cathedral in Cologne, Germany (which is Koln, Deutchland to the natives). “You really have to see it, Fred.” “It’s really cool, it’s the biggest Gothic cathedral in the world.” Blah blah blah. So one day we step out of the train station and Boom, there it is. This 700+ foot church is standing right in front of us. Big, black, pointed, covered in gargoyles. It’s so big it blocks out the sun. And we just stand there, staring at it. “Holy CRAP.” And nobody says anything for like three minutes. Then Ed says, “Yeah, the first time we saw it we were like ‘holy crap’ too.” Ed and I came back a couple days later and I was still like “Holy CRAP” for a full day. I just kept repeating, “It’s so BIG!” But inside was sweet. Imagine a building like that full of mosaic floors with stones no bigger than your pinkie fingernail. The thing took 600 years to build! They also just opened a museum in the basement with some funky relics, like some cattle brandings from the 17th century that’s supposed to cure Mad Cow Disease. Wuh? The rest of the city was pretty nice as well; there are hardly any cars downtown because like most cities in Europe, the streets are too small for ‘em. They tried the same thing in America: they call them shopping malls and since they’re away from population centers the parking lots and highways needed take away the convenience they supposedly make. Ed and I went to a store called Media Markt, kind of a Circuit City. Over there they still have a “Black Music” section for CDs. That really isn’t a big a problem as Ed and I going CD shopping, because we both have serious problems in that category. I think we got like 12 CDs total and then went to Pizza Hut. Ed has been hankering for American food the whole trip—he forced his parents to go to Dunkin Donuts in Berlin for breakfast—so I let him succumb to his urges for once. I took the plunge and had the pizza with pineapple on it, because I figured, hey, yesterday I had pizza with tuna fish on the top; how could this be any worse? I came out of there a convert. Bathrooms cost no matter where you go, and I paid the attendant double because I just felt bad. What else happened in Koln? Well, it was settled around 60 AD by the Romans, but that doesn’t have much to do with my trip.        AACHEN   Aachen always reminds me of the Castle Aaaaaaaaagh mentioned in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.” It’s almost as historical! Here we saw remnants of an old Roman watchtower (still in use), and the church that Charlemagne used to control the Holy Roman Empire from. There’s a bust of Charlemagne in there that actually contains his real skull; Ed found out that whenever a new king took power they would bring out Charlemagne’s head to welcome him. Geez. There was some other story about how the church was bombed during World War II but the late Charlemagne’s Magical Powers deflected everything off the roof. Instead, the bombs all hit the church next door! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ahem. I took pictures of quaint streets and old stones while Ed bought postcards. After all, if you take a bunch of pictures, why buy postcards, and if you buy a lot of postcards, why use a lot of film? We dropped off Joe a day or two before, and realized that our conversations focused more on history, school, and big words compared to when Joe was with us. By the end of the trip, a good 80% of what Joe said involved the word “Bork!” Remember the Swedish Chef from “The Muppet Show,” and nobody knew what he was talking about? In Europe, it was like we were meeting 1000 new Swedish Chefs every day, and we imitated them often through our brash American ignorance. France: “Qu’est-ce que le bork bork?” Germany: “Borken ze bork?” Italy: “Borka borka! That’s-a spicy-a meatball.” Ah, Aachen.        BRUSSELS   Brussels was cold. Hot d*ng, it was cold. You know how cold it is outside now? It was COLDER there. Ed normally prefers walking to the subway—What better way to see the sights?—but we gave up quickly because we were turning blue. So anyway, we kept going into a bunch of churches for no real reason other than they looked neat…and because we were COLD and trying to stay warm! The only thing colder than the weather was the reception we got at the Court of Justice, a really great building where, apparently, some serious shizzy was going down. In Flemish, “shizzy” means depositions, asylum requests, and other international Serious Business. We scrammed without taking pictures because we were afraid of getting arrested. Earlier that day we had the totally required Belgian Waffles and some chocolate (good!) and made our vacation compete visiting the Mannekin Pis. At the waffle place we realized that all the nice French people left France, for several reasons:  1.) The store was closed, but they let us in and took our order  2.) When we left a tip, they got all upset and tried to tell us in French that we paid them too much!  3.) A fellow American tourist’s credit card didn’t work and she “had no money” (sounds dubious) and was allowed to come back later when she found a cash machine  4.) They were awesome waffles!  We also went to the new EU complex, where we found a Tourist Information center with more free stuff than I could carry. So I made Ed carry it for me! Ooh, what else? BRUPARCK! A leftover from a World’s Fair of old, BRUPARCK! has the greatest movie cineplex in the work, a 300-foot tall model of an atom, and fish and chips (good!) for only 7 euros 50.       FRANKFURT   I went to the airport in Duesseldorf to fly home, but not only did the flight get canceled, United Airlines declared bankruptcy and by the time I got there the company had packed up and left. Somehow I ended up in Frankfurt. Frankfurt’s airport has about 400 front desks, and that’s not an exaggeration. I don’t remember how I got home. I mean, I took a plane, but other than that I’m pretty clueless. All I remember is having a cold, running about a mile down a hallway, and having about ten security guards get friendly with me in the course of seven minutes. I played a lot of Game Boy on the plane and tried not to throw up. And that’s the end of my trip! Thank goodness, because I’ve written ten pages about it and I don’t want to write any more. Time for a nap. Bonne annee!

      CD: various, "All Areas Volume 35"  Hey, folks. I decided to skip out of the country for a couple weeks, so, Jiminy, I'm really behind on my posts. So the first posts will be about my trip to Europe, done on a per city basis. I also have an aborted trip log that lasted two full days (don't laugh, it lasted longer than the "running schedule" I instituted last summer). But I'm stuck in the house with a cold and I'm determined to make up the sixteen days I missed. Including this post: Happy New Year! 2003 is shaping up to be a real humdinger of a twelve month cycle. Speaking of which, a more accurate calendar would have thirteen 28 day periods based on the cycle of the moon, which was the intent in the first place. The problem was that 13 is an unlucky number, so they cut it down to twelve and made sure Black History Month got the short end of the deal. So what should the thirteenth month be called? Here are some suggestions, in brainstorming order:  -Bush! -Rocktober -Winslow -Lavigne -Bork Bork Bork! -Shibby -Stern Rules! -Friday -Dick Hertz -The Extra Month, brought to you by Pringles New Sour Cream and Onion Chips. Pringles: Once You Pop, You Can't Stop! -Month of the Llama -Grunge -Danko -H (the H is silent) -Atari -Hammertime  That's enough of that. Finally, the quote of the year so far:  Margaret: "You smell!" Jerry: "What do I smell like?" Margaret: "Like the inside of a turtle!"

      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CD: Robert Plant & Jimmy Page, "No Quarter"  Umm....The idea for this post was that I would go to www.aljazeera.net, get an article in Arabic, and post it here for people to look at and go "wUH?" It worked in Microsoft Word, and I was hopeful. The spellchecker even pointed out a couple errors, which I thought was interesting. It even posted well, but after pressing enter it came out all goofy-like. Well here you go anyway...note the number "1441" which kind of points out what it was talking about.

      CD: Bob Dylan, "Blonde on Blonde"  "I went to kennel and I got to work with the cats, finally! I have been in the dog room for the past 3 times. So anyway, all of the cats were good, and very cute. I didn't enjoy being totally covered inside (I swallowed and breathed some in...haha) and out by cat hair though. We did TPR's on all of them just like we do for the dogs. We also had to pill them...1/2 a tab of 250mg Lidocane...they didn't like that too much, but they were good anyway. Then all of us did the usual stuff, clean out their cages, sweep and mop the cat room, and feed them.  "So after I left kennel I went to the cafeteria. I decided to get a coffee, grapefruit and a chocolate chip muffin (b/c I am PMSing). When I went and sat down and went to eat the muffin, I was amazed that it was still warm! And it was fresh! The chocolate chips were all melty...my favorite! I was sssssoooooo impressed, I called my Mom on her cell phone to tell her about it...she was like...WOW! Haha! So yeah this was one part of my good day...the best part by far! Then when I went to Microbiology, I actually didn't fall asleep like I normally do! It was amazing! Then when we took our quizzes on fungi (molds and yeast) my prof. let us all work in pairs when she saw that no one knew any of the answers to her questions! It was kewl.  "This guy Joe (CarlWinzlow) that I went to college with keeps hitting on me lately. What is his deal? His he serious? Maybe he is...but I just told him that he just wants a piece of ***. He admitted to that part but wouldn't elaborate about anything else...eerr. Well if he is serious I know that he is a nice guy and that he wouldn't hurt me so we'll see. And Joe, if you are reading this...what the **** is up with you lately? FrEaKo..."

      CD: Red Hot Chili Peppers, "By The Way"  I just ate a two-foot sub. Two feet! That's like eating a midget for dinner! So I am naturally very full. I can't move so well and I'm really, reallly tired. There is also an overwhelming urge to drink water. Strange, because I'm full, but I'm thirsty? Is that possible? I thought there was no more room down there. The only reason I'm online now is because I can use my laptop while laying down and I can't do much else. Why is it so tiring, like I just did some exercise? I can just see me in a gym right now. The sweaty guy next to me will say "I just benched 350 for the first time" and I will say "Yeah, but I just ate a two-foot sub." And he will look at me in awe and say "Dude, you must have been training hard." "Cuz two foot subs are nothing to laugh at. And they're dangerous if you don't use a spotter!

      CD: Ben Folds, "Rockin' The Suburbs"  The cops called me up recently. The sheriff's deputy told me that he's been trying to get a hold of me for weeks. A couple of months ago I hit a mailbox at 3 AM in a snowstorm and not only did I leave the scene of the accident--I didn't know it was a crime if you don't hit something living!--they found my front license plate in the snow--I didn't know it was gone--so now I've apparently been on the lamb since Christmas. Even worse, I left the country during this time. I apologized to the policeman and I told him I was sorry he couldn't get to me earlier since I was in Europe. Then he says "You were in Rome? Did you see the Fountain of Trevi?" "Yeah I was..." "Did you go to that nightclub across the street?" What the heck? So the cop's a good guy and he says he doesn't want to waste time arresting me, which is also good. So next time in Rome....

      CD: George Harrison, "All Things Must Pass"  I didn't really feel like going out the other night so I told my friends to just go along without me and "get drunk." I instantly thought that they would have a great time without me. Have you ever heard the one comedian talking about how you always leave the party at the worst time, and how your friends call you up the next day and all their stories start with "Ten minutes after you left...!" Today I thought ahead and called the friend up first. Of course, what do you think I heard? "DUDE FRED YOU MISSED IT! It was like the BEST NIGHT EVER! Blah blah blah we met up with and blah blah party and blah blah we got on TV and blah blah SOOOO funny bork bork bork." Worse? THEN you have to tell them what you did, and it was "I read the paper and went to bed early." Bork bork bork.

      CD: Beatles, "Past Masters Vol. 1"  So my father was flipping channels and got to some old movie about the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. So he watches it for a minute and he goes "Did they ever get their baby back?" [ed. note: This is where the reader starts thinking "Barbeque Sauce."] And I tell him "No." Then I add, "They found it later." So then he goes "Was it okay?" Well if they didn't get the kid back, I don't know!! And THEN he goes, "Was it dead?" Oh my. I myself have tried to stop asking The Redundant Question. You know, comments like "Really?" or "You don't say" or "Are you sure?" I know it annoys some people to no end, while for others it is 90 percent of what they might deem--with conviction--"conversation." It's worse on the phone, where if you don't INTERJECT with banter like "Yeah," "Uh-huh," or "HAHAHAHA" people will think you're not listening and get all "Are you still there?" at you. Yeah, whatever, okay, bye-bye, see you later then. Have a nice day!

      CD: Bob Dylan, "Highway 61 Revisited"  I just finished vacuuming. My father has taken quite a liking to eating popcorn, and he's also found a fine hobby in not picking up dropped kernels. 'Tis sad that I must clean up after others, especially with a college degree, but I do live here rent-free. I guess I should really be complaining that I don't yet have a career, especially with a college degree. Well anyway, I was sucking up all these unpopped kernels when one of them got inside the machine and made this giant POW. Then I thought to myself, "What if it's extremely hot in the vacuum, and it's actually possible to make popcorn INSIDE THE VACUUM CLEANER!?" I tried again as I drove over some more kernels but I couldn't get the same loud noise. Maybe I can get a scientist to work on it. With an unused vacuum bag, of course...

      CD: Bob Dylan, "Love And Theft"  I'm stupid, stupid, stupid. I've complained about this problem with my computer for about a month now. According to my stupidity, the modem wasn't working correctly, as every time I connected my telephone line to the machine all the phones would go dead. Well. So they sent me a new machine, and the first thing I saw when I opened the box was a big sheet saying "How to set up your computer." On that was a diagram showing all of the ports and jacks and whatnot, but it didn't seem right...after all, my phone jack was on the side, not the back...OR IS IT. You know how an Ethernet jack looks a lot like a phone jack? Well, that just shows how stupid Stupid STUPID I am. Here I've been making calls for about a month when all I had to do was put the phone cord in the slot marked with a little picture OF A TELEPHONE NEXT TO IT. This is stupidness of "Did you trying plugging it in?" caliber. No, worse. Almost to the point of it being, "It's loaded, but I clean it real fast." Bah!

      CD: Dan The Automator, "Wanna Buy A Monkey?"  I have developed a theory which I call "Denny's Late Night." Research for this theory has taken about five years and possibly hundreds of dollars. The theory is as follows: when it's the weekend, it's after 11 and no one knows what to do, we end up at Denny's. Sad, yes, but true. I thought the theory was only applicable in the Buffalo area, but apparently it works in the Southtowns as well. I'm almost positive it works on Transit. Anyway, after arguing in a parking lot for near half an hour, the theory kicked in like clockwork. We TRIED going to Applebee's. We TRIED going to Chili's. We TRIED looking at shows and considered hanging out at someone's house. But the Theory, man. Maybe it should be declared a Law of Nature, like gravity and the Yankees. We need more stuff to do.

      CD: White Stripes, "De Stijl" [again]  This is my post about paper clips. First you got your dinky clips. These are the ovular ones that are too small to ever be used on more than 3 sheets of paper. Can’t stand them. Then there’s the medium size. Those are almost okay, but sometimes they have little ridges or niches and I don’t know why. I don’t see it helping the clips’ semi-dinkiness any. So then you get the big ovular ones, which are cool. You can put like 25 sheets in there securely. Awesome. You also have those ones that look like two triangles welded together. I may prefer these. In this case the mediums are probably best because the large ones tend to let sheets slip out if don’t use them on enough papers (ten minimum is probably good). Then you got the black clamps. They usually only come in one size, unless you’re some sort of industrial secretary. You need at least 30 sheets for those. Ever use them with only 15 sheets? Schwag. So my pick goes to the medium-size triangle clips. Word is bond. And with that, I have written a post about paper clips. We can only go up from here.

      CD: Justin Timberlake, "Justified"  [It's actually not half bad. It's not half good, either, but it's not half bad.]  The best part about talking to other teachers is hearing their stories. There are a lot of odd children out there….Anyway all you have to do is mention one interesting thing that happened “in my school today…” and they will all chime in. It reminds me of a pick-up game of basketball, actually. It starts out with you just shooting around, nonchalantly, at an empty hoop. Then some friends shoot around with you. That’s cool; you’re just enjoying the company. Then it gets competitive. They want to play a real game. But you wanted to just shoot around, dangit, you didn’t want to work up a sweat or anything. But now you have to do it. And then someone’s playing defense on you and they get all up in your face, thinking their story, I mean their game is better than yours. And then you have to fight them. They chose knives. Stay cool, boy. Bernardo, no!

      CD: various, "The Roots Of Rap"  This is going to sound extremely disgusting but I think I’m sick again. This time it involves the collection of metric tonnes of mucus, phlegm, snot, spit, and other things that are pretty much the same thing in the way that magma and lava are synonyms. No later than every thirty minutes of every day this week, I must go through the process of draining myself. Blowing my nose has become a marathon event—and no, it’s not running! Each nostril, one at a time, must be configured to give ample space for “release”; basically meaning that it’s like a canal lock in there. It will take days to get there, sure, but eventually the stuff will reach its destination. Unless it goes the express route, which is a singular violent, unexpected and potentially embarrassing cough. But that’s enough about that.

      CD: White Stripes, "De Stijl"  Joe’s making fun of me because he’s a stupid idiot. Here I am at his TA office at UB, just making sure he’s not minding his own business and working hard, and here he’s all “bork bork bork chemistry bork bork” and trying to correct papers. Well phooey on him. I’m looking at him right now, the big oaf. With his big, reddish sideburns and $110 blue jeans, telling me how he finally got this ONE problem done after working on it all day. Oh, now here he goes, out the door. Going to be stupid elsewhere. What a moronic imbecile. I’m not sure if I believe this “chemistry” stuff exists or he’s just writing a bunch of arrows and numbers on a page. Real scholars are going to look at his notes one day and tell everybody he’s King Tut. Wherever he is now, I hope he falls in. Hi Joe, I know you’re reading.

      CD: Dan The Automator, "Wanna Buy A Monkey?"  So anyway the good folks at Dell are like anyone else when you have a complaint. First they actually try to help you, because chances are you're dumb and fixing the problem will only take a second. When it's something worse, they'll try to sound like they're helping but they really don't know what they're talking about. They will offer you a solution that might not work, but it pacifies you and keeps you off their tail. They sent me some replacement parts, but in a couple days I would have to call them back and complain again. So they tried Step 2 on me again and I was like "been there." That means I had to step it up by myself, and demand to see a manager. Of course I had to tell the operator that "it's not your fault, but I have to speak to them," because if you don't they either think you're hostile and need more psychologial support than technical, or you want to get them fired out of blind vengeance. If you keep bugging the manager--who will try only to reiterate all the bad solutions you've heard before--they WILL help you out, but only according to protocol. In this case I learned that the company's last resort is to give you a new hard drive. It has nothing to do with fixing a modem, but play along. The next day the hard drive came in the mail, the modem still didn't work, I called in again all formal like, and it was all wham, new computer, thank you ma'am. And to think I didn't learn anything while working at Burger King....

      CD: Jurassic 5, "Bonus Tracks" promo  There's a commercial playing on TV nowadays that supposedly shows the Dell Tech Support Center (the Interns turn the lights off on them at night). The point of the ad is to show that the good folks at Dell work 24/7 to handle Your Call and help you get on your way. Like all ads, half of it is true. Yes, they're actually quite helpful and polite and whatnot, but there is a glaring error in this one. In the commercial, everyone speaks English! I dare you to call Dell Tech Support and get someone who speaks English as a first language! And after about a month of pondering it, I've finally decided that the people who DO work there in Real Life are all Korean. Why are they all in Nashville? No clue! But it sounds like I keep calling the Wong Family Reunion because they all sound the same, and they're nice as h*ck but NONE of them can get my laptop working. Oy!

      CD: Mahalia Jackson, "Gospels, Spirituals, & Hymns" disc II  My first decree as Emperor of the Free World will be to suppress all those who dare question my power. That goes without saying, really. All opposition must be squashed. How to destroy these rebel forces is the problem. Should I simply isolate and ostracize them? Should I infiltrate their infrastructure and tear them apart from within? Should I kill off their leadership and let the society fall into riotous turmoil? Should I bribe the populace with weapons, food, and lower taxes? Oh well. The second decree is to ban nuclear weapons, because everyone who opposes me will be gone so I won’t need them anymore. That was hard. Third? I’m buying the Buffalo Sabres. They will also get 25 points added to their season record so when they don’t make the playoffs this year it won’t look so bad.

      CD: Mahalia Jackson, "Gospels, Spirituals, & Hymns" disc I  If you have a satellite dish, you can watch tons of sports you’ve either never heard of or never really cared about. Right now the World Cup of Cricket is playing a reel of highlights. I still don’t know what the heck they’re doing over there, but they seem to be training pretty hard. I can watch handball, curling, lacrosse, and something that I think is called slamball. Slamball is basketball, but with trampolines built into the floor. So now the players can dunk from three-point range, assuming someone doesn’t try to block them in midair, causing them to collide twenty feet up. And hit the ground. And bounce back up. The first time I saw it I thought it was a Gatorade ad, but then they cut to commercial. I just sat there thinking “Wuh?” Have you seen this sport? Oddness.

      CD: Pete Seeger, "American Industrial Ballads"  The President used to look really stupid, like the kind of guy that needs extra time to read things. But since that whole September 11th thing, and that whole Iraq up the wazoo thing, it looks like he’s been thinking a lot more. You know, really pondering stuff and doing some problem solving. So now he looks smarter, but he also looks angrier. It’s been my racist opinion that dumb people are usually happier. I think it’s because they know of more problems in the world, like war and famine, while the not-so-thoughtful people watch American Gladiators. And while looking at this weblog a second time before posting it, I can see that my lack of word variety, such as the using the word “thing” three times instead of using more descriptive diction, just proves that I’m at least borderline inside the American Gladiators group.

      CD: Coal Chamber, "Chamber Music"  Sometimes sentences seem really strange out of context. I heard one of them from a friend several weeks ago. He said, “I got addicted to sushi in Nashville.” Addicted? Sushi? Nashville? Those are three nouns I never thought I’d hear in succession. Anyway, it’s just a fun game to play with yourself if you feel bored at work, school, or especially while talking to your parents. (They always end up bringing up medical stuff, and that’s hilarious.) So the newest addition to the canon was at church the other day. At the end of the sermon the pastor gave this big, involved story about, um, lots of stuff. To sum up, he said: “God may not need your baloney, but he wants to give you his chicken.” Yep. Goodnight.   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 2/18/03 5:49:19 pm

      02 07 03 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CD: Ben Folds Five, "The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner"  I haven’t added to this weblog thing in a long time. And you know what? I don’t really want to! BWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! But I’ve been thinking about a few things. Like, would you rather find mayonnaise in your peanut butter jar, or peanut butter in your mayonnaise jar? Think about it. What else was I thinking about? I forgot. Ooh! Why is a bicycle called a bike and a tricycle called a trike but a unicycle not called a unike? I need answers! Why do animals follow kids home, but don’t follow adults? Why did that one guy quit Limp Bizkit? Why are they called Limp Bizkit? Why did they spell Bizkit with a Z? Why does everyone else call Z “Zed”? Who thought up all these silent letters? I DON’T LIKE SILENT LETTERS. Especially when it’s P. Silent Ps are messed up. Hey, I wrote another post!   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 2/18/03 5:47:47 pm

      CD: Liz Phair, "Whip-Smart"  For those of you that don't know, I'm keeping my eye on you. I have saved, with several exceptions, every IM conversation and every personal E-mail from the past 4+ years. That means you can pick a day--any day--and I can tell you what you said to me. (I can also tell you what other people said about you, but that would go against my principles.) When I sent my computer in for repairs I kept these texts online, stored in my online mailbox, but after a month without a base the mailbox is getting full. Now I must transfer almost 200 correspondences to permanent data storage (a disc). That's going to take me a long, freaking time. Nuts. But if you ever DO want to know what you were saying (especially when you weren't sober, which happens more offen than you'd like to admit it) give me a ring. (P.S., I don't record phone conversations.)  jeoffroi (4:21:49 PM): the language of blog is a language of paradox jeoffroi signed off at 4:21:52 PM.

      CD: Squirrel Nut Zippers, "The Inevitable"  I was just thinking back to about a month ago when my father enlisted my help to get a desk out of my church in the middle of the night. It was one of those larger secretaries' desk with the filing cabinets built in. Also remember that it was around 0 degrees outside and windy, and the path from the door to the car was uphill and covered with about six inches of ice. The desk took an ample amount of pushing just to get it through the door (it technically did not fit), but it was the freezing cold and the absolute lack of solid footing that did me in. And I must be honest: right there, in front of my father and on church property, I still yelled out "F*CK!" as I slipped and let that 250 pound piece of office furniture fall on top of me. The end.

      CD: Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, “Xtra Acme USA”  For some reason this little light has been on in my car that says something like “Service” underneath it or something. I had no idea. Eventually I had to pull out the manual and find out what the bloody thing actually WAS, let alone what it meant. After searching through a few pages of hieroglyphics, I found out it was the Engine light. That could mean a lot of things, like “the car’s computer needs tweaking” or “it’s going to blow up.” I figured it was closer to the first thing and only yesterday got an appointment at the dealership. After setting a time they gave me some line about the gas cap not being on tight enough or something, and to check that, but it’s almost an insult to my intelligence to suggest I missed something like that (of course, I once drove from Indianapolis to Columbus with the tank door upon). I then tried to think of something quick, almost an excuse to say I was in there for a Reason other than ineptitude. “Well, I, uh, hit a couple mailboxes a while back.” “Oh!” they collectively cried. That was a couple months ago, but I got those guys on my side now. Plus, now they’ve got a story to ask me about when I’m hangin’ out over there tomorrow! Keen!

      CD: Black Label Society, “Black Label Society”  Joe was in my room the other day and commented on all the books I had. Well thank you Joe! Looking at them right now it does seem like I have a lot of books--like a wall full. I must admit, however, that it is an illusion. For instance, about a quarter of my shelf space is taken up by vinyl records. It means I’m less of a reader, though it does make me cooler.  There is a small section at the top corner which is really not books but old magazines and yearbooks, which are only worth looking at once every couple of years. My stereo takes up the rest of the top shelf. So that leaves only three small shelves worth of books. Now I must admit that I read a whole shelf of me. I did NOT, however, read the other two shelves! For example, about one shelf is a bunch of history textbooks I took for free from a teacher that wanted to get rid of the promotional stuff she’s saved over the years. And the third shelf? On the bottom of each book is a little sticker that says USED SAVES. No REAL book-reader in their right-thinking mind would proudly display Used Book stickers on their Used Books! Take a second look, Joe, I’m not as smart as I look!

      CD: Eminem, ¡§The Eminem Show¡¨  I¡¦ve been going back and forth with the good people at Dell because my computer is messed up. I thought that they must have these giant banks of people in Customer Service, but apparently there¡¦s just this guy named Walter that handles all my calls. Poor Walter. He has an accent from who-knows-where, and he does this weird thing where he slows down and speeds up what he says in mid-phrase, sometimes pausing in between. If I knew what the accent was, I might be able to translate! Anyway, the first couple of times I called Walter seemed all chipper and ¡§How may I help you?¡¨-ish. (Kind of cocky, too, if you ask me.) But today he seemed depressed. He talked slower and signed before he said stuff like ¡§Thank you for calling Dell. How may I help you today.¡¨ „²Note the period! I hope everything is all right at home. Walter seems like a decent guy, and having to work at Tech. Support you gotta feel bad for him. Sadly, the two hours I spent with him today probably just made him feel worse ¡¥cuz he couldn¡¦t help out at all. He seemed happier at Wegmans.

      CD: U2, "Best Of 1990-2000"  This afternoon I finally got my voice back enough that I can speak whole sentences with cracking or going into a coughing fit--well, mostly. But it has also given me an extremely low voice. Maybe I have somehow widened my voice box or something, I don't know, but when I can talk I sound like Barry White. So my brother met one of my friends at his work today and they decided to call me. First they didn't know who it was, but once they figured out the situation they put me on Speaker Phone at Guitar Center and had me say stuff for fun like "Ohhhhh Bay-bee" reeeeel slooooow. This is the one part about strep throat that I'm going to miss. That and sleeping in until... well, sometimes I didn't "technically" get up. I wonder if it's possible to get my voice box surgically widened so I can talk like Barry White all the time! Oh baby! Or James Earl Jones at least! "THIS IS CNN." Cool!

      CD: Frank Sinatra, "The Very Good Years"  Now my entire family is hooked on Subway subs. Today I had my fourth in a week. That's right! The delicious taste of Subway subs has come home. A new franchise opened up near my house ("near" is like six miles away over here) and my father decided to check it out. Now he can't get enough, and has already filled enough Sub Club cards to get a free sub and then some! Woo! Sometimes when my family is eating them at home people will just randomly say things like "I really like their choice of bread; it's great that they make it right in the store" and "it doesn't bog you down like regular subs; it fills you up without making you full!" as if they were that Jerod guy or something. So here's the deal, Subway: put us in your commercials as The Subway Family, watch your sales go through the roof, and then give us free subs for the rest of our days! Rock over London, rock on Chicago, Subway: eat fresh! Whee!

      CD: Coldplay, "A Rush Of Blood To The Head"  I do wonder how many people in the news departments of America realize that something like "Operation: Iraqi Freedom" proves by its own name that its portrayal by the United States Government is propaganda at the very least. I don't know about you, but when the people of a nation really want to be liberated, shouldn't they do it themselves? Heck, even the French knew that. So why can't the Iraqis? Are they lazy? Or maybe it's something worse: they don't want to overtake Saddam Hussein. And if I may compare Iraq to the American and French Revolutions (and even the Bolshevik Revolution), when those countries were "liberated" they Stopped being controlled by foreign powers, not the opposite. Why should the United States do something that a people should earn for themselves? Bah!

      CD: The Donnas, "Spend The Night"  Whilst bowling this night, I happened perchance to partake of a faulty bowling ball returning machine. For some reason the balls would not come back from the magical chute in the ground! So I've been thinking about it, and just what goes on begind those pins, anyway? I know Fred Flintstone had a pterydactyl (sp?) putting his day's work in, putting up carved-rock pins and making funny little comments, but what about today? And how do you keep score in a bowling game? How does 10 times 10 equal 100? One thing has never changed, and it is the definition of the bowling experience: Shoes. I'm going to call Calvin Klein and suggest a bowling clothes line--the untucked, shiny, button shirts, sure, but the multi-colored, pseudo-leather shoes are the epitome of retro fashion! It's like stepping your feet into 1978. If you could only wear them to interviews...

      CD: Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?"  What IS going on? For the fourth time in three weeks I have gotten lost at the University of Buffalo. Seeing how I've gone there sporadically for the past two years now for research purposes, wouldn't I know my way around by now? NOOOOO! What's up with that? The other day I drove around the campus, deftly maneuvering the I-290, the Millersport Highway, Niagara Falls Boulevard and some wierd private access road to make a beautiful circle ten miles in diameter. I wanted to go in a straight line! Argh! Today I had to be at a class in half an hour, and of course I drove out of a completely different exit that I went into and got lost, and late. How is that possible if I take the same road I came IN campus with and end up OUT of campus two streets away? And why haven't I bought a compass after all this time? Bork!!

      CD: Guided By Voices, "Isolation Drills"  There is a bookcase in my room that is about six feet high...in parts. We found it one Christmas when the neighbors across the street threw it out. Covered with ice, we brought it upstairs. The wood is all bent up now, and it is probably getting worse because now it is loaded with a couple hundred books I don't read and another couple hundred records I don't listen to, not to mention the yearbooks I am ashamed to look at placed next to the stereo I can barely reach. Yet there it all sits. It's a monolith of furniture and an archives depository all at once. Now that it is full, what do I do with it? Should I go find more garbage as an add-on? should I buy Real bookshelves? Wait for an earthquake and see what's left? Good thing I don't really care.

      CD: Weezer, "Weezer" [2001]  If I don't turn off the television, I end up watching the war for eight hours, and that just can't be healthy. The satellite dish gives me about eight differnet channels to watch...I got ABC, NBC, CBS, ITV, BBC, CBC, NWI, CNBC, CNN, CNNFN, MSNBC, KMFDM, LMNOP, and, of course, NWA. All I know is that you can get those nasty pictures on Al-Jazeera's website even without reading Arabic, that the "War Desk" on CNNFN has my laptop on it, and that first night where they were blowing stuff up like crazy? THAT was fun, admit it! I do wonder how much less news I'd have to watch if the US and Iraq could stop using all that rhetoric about how victory is inevitable, and our soldiers are brave and courageous, bork bork bork. Maybe from eight hours to seven.

      CD: Moby, "Play"  I recently bought a cell phone. That means you have to write to all of your friends and give them your new number, which they will easily forget the first couple of times they need to call you. That's not a problem. The most disappointing thing in my situation, however--and this was pointed out to me by one of the friends I wrote to--was that my E-mail was sent out to nine people. Nine. Sad, huh? I pay $35 dollars a month so I can talk to nine people. Four of them live in my house. Or is it more depressing when one of them writes back and makes fun of you for only writing to nine people? Or that he just got a cell phone, too, and will probably only call three or four people with it? Or that it's 11:20 on a Monday morning and I still haven't gotten out of bed? Alas.

      CD: Pavement, "Slanted And Enchanted" (deluxe)  It is 12:10 AM. What a great day this March 23rd has been! Definitely in the top 1000 of good days. What did I do today? Oh, gee...let me think. Well, I was reading this newspaper, as I am wont to do sometimes, and it was really interesting! Yeah! But then I thought to myself, "Hey, I wonder if I have any E-mail to check." So about halfway through the day, at about 12:05 AM, I checked my E-mail! I didn't have any! Wow! I wonder if I'll ever get any more. I guess only time will tell, huh? Already a mystery. Then I decided that since it was a new day, I would add to my weblog. I was listening to my Pavement album the night before, so I started of my new post with the title of the album I had played. Coincidence? No, silly! Then I started writing my weblog. It was about 12:10 in the morning by then. Well, what a day! I better get some rest. Toodles for now!

      CD: Rage Against The Machine, "Rage Against The Machine"  Spring Break has been a wash. Compared to previous Spring Breaks, where I was out of town and on vacation, I have done some homework. So this is a 100% increase. Yet, thirty minutes isn't exactly going to help me out like I'd hoped. On one hand, I did go bowling last night. It was much more enjoyable than, say, a study of 17th century Dutch economics. I really don't know how to fully articulate what I'm saying, because I was out all night and didn't get any sleep, but it's too bad I didn't get any papers done. I'll just have to blame the war or something. That darned Saddam! Why couldn't he be like that nice Timothy McVeigh boy and be easier to catch?! Hmm, I probably shouldn't have said that...like that. Wait, what did I just say? I better get some sleep...it's a good reason for not starting more homework, too...

      CD: various, "Negros Blues And Hollers"  Most every night, my father sits on the couch once he gets home and doesn't get up. He eventually falls asleep on the couch, snoring and keeping me awake. Then I have to close my bedroom door and since the heater is in my room, the building goes cold while my room gets to be about 90 degrees, so I have to keep a window cracked open in the middle of winter. So last night I put my foot down. Well, my butt. I got home first, grabbed my laptop, the remote and a book. I laid on that couch for several hours before he got home. He sat on one end of the couch and started nodding off, except for the couple of times he would turn his head, slowly open his eyes and see if I was still there. You could see the disappointment in him. A couple of times he would mumble something about "Well I guess I should go to bed soon..." right before he would glance at me. At about 1:30 he finally capitulated and went to his bedroom for good. I had won the night. I told my sister what I did and we celebrated for several seconds. Then I told her I was tired out too from all my squatting and I went to bed. The end.   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 3/20/03 2:45:36 am

      CD: Fiona Apple, "When The Pawn..."  This war thing is taking forever. Just think, if they do reenactments of it in 2203, it will involve sitting in the desert for 3 months, doing nothing. It'll be pretty boring, that's for sure. And then one of the troop reenactors will pull out a laptop computer and press a button, something will blow up, and the battle will be over. Not that I want anyone to die in this war, or that I want this war at all, but come on already. it really has been twelve years since this thing has started. I almost like Bush for being impatient. Saddam Hussein is like that one kid in elementary school that was so annoying that you wanted to pop him one but he never got caught doing anything wrong. He would make fun of you and then hide behind a tree in the playground or stand next to the teacher so you couldn't rough him up. Still, if you ignored him he would go away after a while...

      CD: Talib Kweli, "Quality"  My theory is has been tried and tested, and still true: If there is no specific reason to get together, as my friends and I did the other night, we will somehow end up at Denny's. That doesn't mean we specifically want to go to Denny's. What used to be a fun outing has turned into a tradition and then an out and out regrettable situation. Last night I decided that since I was driving, we were just going to drive down one road until someone decided what we were going to do next. We got halfway to driving off of the Niagara Falls when I had to give up and turn around. It's a shame when your posse physically GOES to several places says "NO! We must go do Denny's." But you know what? They have darn good sandwiches and pies and I barely care anymore. Moons Over My Hammy for everyone! I had a great time. Free refills!

      CD: James Brown, "Say It Live And Loud: Live In Dallas 08.26.68"  Someone mentioned that it's going to look really bad when the United States declares war on Iraq and the world press comes to get our reaction, and everyone is drunk and dancing in the streets with party hats and floats because it's St. Patrick's Day. They're going to have a field day with us. I never really liked this holiday because I don't drink and don't like drunks, but since green is my favorite color I guess it's passable as a celebration. Interesting, though, that we're starting a war to combat terrorism (or whatever they call it) around a day celebrating the Irish, who would be World Terrorist Enemy #1 if it weren't for that whole Arab-Israeli thing. How many people have died from Irish terrorist acts? Nomatter. All we know over here in the states was that there was some sort of famine and what do you know, everyone in the Fire Department has a name that starts with "O'." Also, Lucky Charms is the best kids' cereal ever.

      CD: Taleb Kwali, "Quality"  Yesterday I went to downtown Buffalo, which was interesting because it was actually nice out for once and people were taking walks, looking around at the city like they just came out of their bomb shelters. It was Saturday, so no one had much of a reason to be there. We were just surprised the sun was shining and stuff wasn't falling from the sky. On the windows of the abandonned Burger King was a sign that said "Fat, Ugly Italian Male looking for Nice Girl with a Sense of Humor, 878-xxxx." That was kind of funny. The subway was half-filled with people that didn't want to look at each other. I was the most handsome person there. I rode the subway down to its last stop at South Campus and the floor was really slippery, probably from the moisture with the weather and everything melting. Dangerous.

      CD: White Stripes, "De Stijl"  Some months ago I made what could be called the Mother Of All Mix Albums, or MOAMA, for some foreign guys at work. Tonight I pulled it out and copied to my laptop and dude, this is fun! Now I technically have my own portable MP3 player! Whee! And it's already loaded with 200 of my favorite songs. The best part is that I forgot what songs I put on the thing so I get a pleasant surprise every three minutes or so. Now I recall the three days it took for me to put the MOAMA together; how I fussed over song selection, how I tried to be eclectic (no band appears more than once) while still fitting everything in. Finally my hard work, though relatively still useless, is paying off. AND, as an added bonus, WinAmp is automatically fading in between tracks. Fantastic.

      CD: Pearl Jam, "Riot Act"  The best part about my winter trip to Europe may not be the actual vacation but the ability to refer to it in conversation later. Watching the news today they showed the Chancellor of Germany giving a speech to the legislature, and DUDE I was IN THAT BUILDING! Cool! Somewhere I learned that Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's favorite tourist attraction in Rome is the Spanish Steps, and I was ON those steps! Whenever they talk about the Eiffel Tower, the EU headquarters in Belgium, the Vatican's plea for peace in the Middle East...I was there, making me an EXPERT compared to all y'all who are only TALKING about the stuff! So they want to rename French Fries "Freedom Fries" because they think the French are snooty, self-centered anti-Americans? Well guess what? I was actually IN FRANCE and they ARE snooty, self-centered anti-Americans. How about those pommes, Jacques?

      CD: "Langley Schools Music Project"  Spring Break. Wooooooooo. There are no girls going wild here in farm country, nor do I see Fat Joe getting ready to perform. Even the upcoming St. Patrick's Day holiday fails to pique the interest of our Germanic neighbors. What to do then? Well, it seems that my academic adversaries, or "professors," have all designed that I must write them a 15-20 page paper. So instead of warm beaches and cold water (The ocean's always cold no matter where you are, isn't that such a disappointment?) I will get to visit cold libraries and search for old books. Maybe I'll even stop procrastinating long enough to write something down. My Beach House will consist of a bunch of bundled-up, grandfatherly dudes trying to look up totally rad geneology records!

      CD: Green Day, "Warning"  I found this during my research and I though it was interesting. Some things never change . . . .  from "Republican Advocate" by D. C. Miller. Batavia, NY Fri. Evening 18 August 1826 VOL. 15, NO. 758 Pg. 3 col.1  <<“He who is not for us is against us.”—This is an old and trite saying—and whatever may be the hazard in any laudable untertaking, rendered necessary by the nature and state of things, the whimperings of nerveless friendship, doling out its fears of cousequences, is lost upon him whose purposes are as just as unchangeable; and could such friends duly estimate things, whey would consider their advice, as it really is—worthless. Armed with justice, none but cowards fear consequences. What are scoffs, threats and persecution to him who is bent upon purposes good?

      CD: Wesley Willis, "Daren Hacker"  Most of this was from an E-mail I just sent to Ed:  Guess who Joe and I saw last night? That's right, the one and only WESLEY WILLIS. The jam was a knockout! The singer rocked like a Magikiss! The show was supposed to be at Mohawk Place but because of all that Great White stuff the fire marshall had them move it to the Continental. It was the best show I've seen him do by far. He was on a Harmony Joy Ride for sure! He did the hits of course--"Rock and Roll McDonald's," "Cut the Mullet,"--but he unveiled some other stuff like "Michael Jackson," which may be his best song yet (just look up the lyrics), "Osama bin Laden," and the encore, "My Demon is the Devil's Son." They even sounded like different songs this time! He's gotten a lot better. Now he pauses right after he says "Rock Over London, Rock On [Buffalo New York]" so people can cheer before he does his slogan and the ends fade out. It was a success! There were about 100 people at the show! Suddenly, it was over. Just plain awesome.  I would also like to add that the toilets at the Continental are human rights catastrophies. I think there should also be a Toilet Marshall that goes around to bars and clubs to see if they're deadly or not. They're just accidents waiting to have already happened.

      CD: Jimmy Eat World, "Bleed American"  I remember a long time ago (months!) I wrote a post about how Saddam Hussein released almost all the prisoners in his jails in Iraq. And I sarcastically commented that it must be this Great Coincidence that American troops were coming over to fight his country, and he needed troops for his army--hey, here are some, and they're big fans of yours, Hussein! Well now I'm wondering if they're actually in the Iraqi guard. If they are or they aren't, aren't they bored? Come to think of it, what are the Iraqi people doing right now? It's not like they can make any big plans..."Yo Abdul, you wanna help me move?" "Sure, Mohammed, but you sure you want to right now, what with the war and all?" "Oh yeah, I forgot. They might blow our houses up. Maybe later then?" Or maybe, "Yo Abdullina, would you like to come to my bachelorette party?" "Sure, Mohammedina, but you sure you want to get married right now, what with the war and all?" "Oh yeah, I forgot. They might kill my husband in a firefight and my future children could die of starvation. Maybe later then?" All I know for sure is that if I were living there right now, I'd be in the basement trying to get through Ulysseys.

      CD: Oasis, "Be Here Now"  Uuuuugh. I knew it wouldn't work. So I got to the library at about 4 yesterday, vowing not to leave until I finished my five-page paper, which is due tonight. after about six hours, I had competed ONE PAGE. That's right, somehow I was able to sit in one place and only write ONE PAGE of a book review. How horrible is that? Right now I'm wasting my time on this thing (which is going much faster, by the way) but I think I've figured it out: years of all-nighters and last-minute writing make me unable to function as a regular student unless there is a pressing deadline upon me. I bet that by the end of the afternoon this paper will be done quickly simply because it has to be. The words will magically appear on the page--almost like its their destiny--but for now they will not come. No matter, I must sign off and forge ahead. But first...breakfast...

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "White Lillies Island"  Today I fully intend to spend all day at the library and I just know it will never work. It never does. I tell myself I will work all day long but I end up goofing off for a couple of hours and then going back home. This time I have a five-page paper to write and I refuse to leave until I do...if I do leave, it's thirty miles to home so I have an extra incentive to stay. Nevertheless, I was supposed to be there a couple of hours ago and I just got out of bed. Now I'm writing this stupid weblog which means I will waste even more time before I even eat breakfast. When I first started writing these log things it was to practice answering those "About Me" essays on job applications, but now I see it's my new excuse to procrastinate. Once again I have ruined my academic career.

      CD: Natalie Imbruglia, "Left Of The Middle"  I just saw the High School Play version of the movie Footloose, and I must say I expected looser feet. It was very unprofessional.  But for some reason all I could think about during the play was the inevitable war in Iraq. So the hero of the story--the guy that just wanted to dance, dance, dance!--and his friends became the anti-war protesters, and the evil minister became George Bush, and the minister kept pushing for war because of some accident with his father in the last war--probably the assassination attempt--and he was all cantankerous and wouldn't listen to anybody, and then the hero got up in front of everybody and said "blessed are the peacemakers" but all the old people voted for war anyway...and George Bush really couldn't sing but he still got some applause because he seemed like a nice kid that tried really hard. I still don't know what to name my daydream: Trooploose? Obtoose? Oh well.

      CD: Missy Elliot, "Under Construction"  Today, a first: I taught an elementary school class. Six, actually. Through this I found out something amazing: children are transfixed upon a television. It doesn't even have to be showing anything. A blank, blue screen will suffice; the children will love it. Today I played videos for all six of these classes. From Kindergarden through grade six, the kids just sat there quietly. It was amazing. Best classes I've ever had. I noticed that there are four levels of television understanding with kids:  Grade 5+6: Cool, it's video time. We don't have to do anything.  Grade 4+3: A movie! This is funny stuff! Grade 2+1: Wow, a dancing elephant! Kindergarden: [mouths agape. no comprehension until the songs come in]

      CD: John Coltrane, "The Very Best Of John Coltrane"  I forgot how to read. After all these years, I forgot how to sound out words, read phonetically, stay on one line at a time. In college I developed the ability to read two or three lines at a time to better skim the material so I could spend my time more wisely not doing the dishes for my dorm. Reading the newspaper too often has made me skip whole paragraphs in a quick search for important quotes and concise summaries. So now, whenever I want to read a real book--or even a long New Yorker article--it's darn near impossible. I lose my place, I turn the page halfway through reading the one before it, and sometimes stop and say to myself "I don't know what I just read. I didn't remember a single word." It's been difficult, but with a few hours of practice every night I've tried to regain my reading abilities. Sure, every page of my graduate textbooks are a challenge, but so was inventing the light bulb and we're glad someone did that! So to conclude, reading is worth it. But you don't have to take MY word for it....

      CD: Weezer, "Maladroit"  In Buffalo, the transition from winter to spring has been more schizophrenic than usual. Usually there's no spring anyway, but this year we just might give it a try. So this past week or two we have experienced temperatures of zero or below, then had temperatures in the 40s, then back to zero again. Today it was up and started raining, but now it is down and snowing again. As in city government, the weather can't make up its mind, either. Perhaps hail tonight? Maybe more snazzy snow. Nobody knows; we can't predict a thing. And in this town it doesn't really matter either way, because nobody will do anything differently with their day until a yard of the stuff hits the ground; one reason (and only one?) why living here is better than in Florida.

      CD: Lenny Kravitz, "Greatest Hits"  Ooh, those crazy French. They remind me of this kid named Keith I used to go to school with that everyone wanted to beat up on the playground. He wasn't really evil or anything, just a dork. Even if he said things you agreed with, you still wanted to beat him up. So that's France to me. Sure, I'm not too fond about this upcoming war either, and I would probably vote against it if I were France, too. But it's the delivery, I guess. That, and every time someone threatened to beat up Keith--which happened often, by the way--he would run away like a little girl. And that is 100% France. I wonder what Keith is up to right now...probably pretending not to know English, and selling bottles of Coca-Cola for $4.50 a pop, and having national holidays whenever I happen to visit so I'll never get to see the Mona Lisa. Jerks.

      CD: Beastie Boys, "Hello Nasty"  I had the chance to answer a few questions about Americans' view of a war in Iraq for a student paper in Brazil, so I thought I'd post my answers here as well:   Do you think that it is really important to USA win the war?  If the USA actually does start a war, yes. By "winning" we mean the USA would have to take Saddam Hussein out of power permanently. Many Americans believe we should have taken Hussein in the last war, when we had the chance. Personally, I do not think this is a war we have to fight. If we do not fight a war we will probably be no worse because of it. The only problem is that our country has made threats to Iraq for so long, if we do not back our words with our weapons we will look foolish to the world. President Bush put us in a bad position: if we are for him, we look like a bully, but if we stop the war from happening, we may make America look even worse.  "Veja", the most important magazine in Brazil (like Newsweek) is showing in the front page: "Bush makes the world furious". How do you fell about that?   I am against the war myself, so I can understand if the world is "furious." "Worried" might be a good word, too, because violence may spread in the Middle East. Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, however, America feels different from other countries. There is now the belief that much of the world hates us anyway, even if there were no war, because we are a rich, powerful nation. If you ask people that are for a war, they will say that the world simply does not understand that we have special responsibilities as a superpower nation, and that by taking out Hussein (even without UN support) we will be helping the rest of the world and not hurting it. Americans have all seen the protests from around the world on television, and some of the biggest protests were right here in places like Washington, D.C. and New York City. Americans have been very accepting of anti-war activists, though some of our leaders do not say it. The only backlash I have seen against the "furious" parts of the world has been towards France. Many Americans think France owes us for saving them from Hitler, and are only trying to gain politically from not agreeing with us. We also find it ironic that some of the nations that accuse us of starting a war for oil (France, Germany, and Russia) also have some of the most money invested in oil contracts with Iraq.  Are you nervous about the consequences that this war can bring to your economy? What do you think about the Iraq population? Are you afraid of terrorist attacks after the war?  The war has already hurt our economy. Petroleum prices are rising sharply now, and though oil companies blame the situations in Iraq and Venezuela for the cost, we believe they are just trying to make greater profits. The stock market is down, and consumer confidence is at a ten-year low. The war will make the economy worse still. As for the Iraqi population, Americans genuinely believe that Saddam Hussein is evil and is a greater threat to Iraqis than America could ever be. We have heard horror stories of torture and mass killings by Hussein for years now. Some of us think that the UN sanctions against Iraq killed many thousands of people, too. It seems that the only way for the sanctions to be lifted is to get rid of Saddam Hussein. Though I do not think war is necessary right now, it seems the only way anyone will ever remove him and restore Iraq will be by force.  I do not know what Brazilians learn about American society, but it seems that Americans are split between two ideas about terrorism. One feeling is that we should be very afraid for future terrorist attacks, should always be prepared, and should be willing to send the military around the world to prevent terrorism from striking again. The government has even created a color-coded Terror Alert System. Starting at this year's hajj in Mecca, the alert was at High Alert until yesterday. If you watched the news on television, there was a symbol on the screen saying "TERROR ALERT ORANGE: HIGH."   The second group of people is a bit more pessimistic. They think terrorism will happen again, yes, but what can we really do? We will be as prepared as we can be no matter what occurs. That group of people think the government is using terrorism to scare people into believing that policies like a war in Iraq are necessary, even when it was Osama bin Laden, not Saddam Hussein, that attacked the USA. They also think that President Bush is not giving the public evidence that there is any reason to be afraid, but by starting a war in Iraq, they will only make more people hate the USA and create more future terrorists. I am in this second group. The government recently recommended that citizens buy duct tape, plastic bags, bottled water, and other items in case a terrorist strikes. Only a few people in the first group thought the items would be useful. In the 1950s, the government said we could protect ourselves from nuclear radiation by hiding under a table. It will take much more than that to convince Americans--and the rest of the world--that we are using our common sense in 2003.

      CD: Missy Elliot, “Under Construction”  Ooh, those sneaky church people. So the church started looking for new ushers, and my mother got it into her head that she knew I wanted to be one, if that makes any sense. After the sermon I was walking down the hall when one guy goes “Hey, your mother was looking for you; she’s just down the hall over there.” I went in the direction he pointed, and as I got there another guy goes, “You came! Great!” Huh? “The usher meeting is right in here; it will only take a few minutes.” I’ve been captured! And of course when I got in the room a third guy asked me if my mother “finally persuaded me to join.” All I could do was reply, “I really don’t know what I’m doing!” We all had a good laugh.

      CD: Velvet Underground & Nico, “The Velvet Underground & Nico”  In my freshman year of college I had a roommate named Micah who, besides dancing with himself and playing classical guitar covers of Dave Matthews songs, pretended his computers were his girlfriends and even named them. I laughed at him then. Alas, I was so very wrong to do so. With my new laptop I have given in. Her name is Ashley. Why, you may ask, is she—um, it—named Ashley? Could it be the black, ashen color of the laptop? Could it stand for “A Superbly Helpful Laptop for Educating Yourself”? Or could it be because actress Ashley Judd is just plain amazing? All I know is that it’s hard getting by without her. Well, I’ve got the other computer, but let’s keep that on the D.L.   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 3/2/03 2:36:54 pm

      I was thinking about my weblog, as I often do, and decided that I didn't want to do it anymore. It was fun enough, but then I got busier and more bored. I'm surprised people read the stupid thing, actually. Anyway, after this semester ends I think I'll start a newsletter-type E-mail thing instead. So rather than one post a day, I'll do a weekly something-or-other. Maybe I'll call it "Fredline News." Maybe I won't, so there! But in either case I will still post it here on my blog board after it goes out. If you want it, just send me your E-mail address, but chances are you're going to get one anyway. I can't think of any strangers that read these entries. So I'll conclude on that note...wait, no I won't. Friday is my birthday; everybody should give me gifts I don't deserve. I feel relieved already. Thanks for reading so far...  -ts0

      CD: White Stripes, "Elephant"  I just wrote this in an E-mail to someone else, but it was a pretty good summary of my day:  "OK, so I went to UB because some friends and I bought tickets to a concert a long time ago and Joe was going to sell an extra one we had to someone he knows, and I had to bring him the extra ticket. I was going to use their library anyway to do homework, and be there all day. So I met him at Best Buy (we went to buy the new White Stripes album as well) and he says "Fred, my muffler fell off!" Sure enough, it was gone. So we buy our CDs, and Joe has to go to UB for a meeting, so we decide that he'll take the car to a garage later, and I'll take him home from there. After a couple of hours, he calls my cell phone from the parking lot (I knew it'd come in handy!) and says "Fred, your tire is flat." Sure enough, it was flat. So we decide to take off the tire, put it in Joe's car, and see if the garage can help us both out. It ends up being too late, so Joe tells the guy he'll leave the car there overnight, and we go looking for another tire place. We find one and give them the tire, and it happened to be across the street from Guitar Center so we paid my brother a visit at work. We also played on the keyboards. (Whee!) The tire place calls me on my cell phone (I knew it'd come in handy!) and says my tire is too messed up to get fixed. I call my father (handy!) and ask his advise; he says I should buy two tires for the car if the place is open long enough to put them on. We go back to UB to get my car, and too late, the place is closing. So we drop off Joe's car at the other garage, and we're hungry, so we go to Duff's. We both order the 20-wing Combo Meal that comes with a bowl of fries and a pitcher of pop. I eat all of mine and am very proud. Joe can only eat half of his, but somehow he makes fun of my accomplishments. The nerve! So then I drop him off, and here I am at Buff State, almost nine hours later than when I said I would start my homework, with one of those dinky little spare tires attached to my car. I'll probably be home around 3 AM."

      CD: Creedence Clearwater Revival, "Chronicle"  Mmm...swearing. It seems that swearing is funnier when you don't say the words. On The Osbournes in Britain, nothing is censored out, and the ratings are lower. Maybe people just like to think harsh words but not hear them. I also think that TV networks, et cetera do not want to offend anyone, even though everybody has heard those words a million times before and it probably doesn't shock anyone anymore. Then you get people that like to swear but don't want to say the words, so they create banal substitutes. "Oh Sugar" is something my father says a lot. I'm still waiting for the day when he's actually talking about sugar: "Oh Sugar! I forgot to buy some sugar!" Something like that.  Maybe that's a bad example. I have a pastor that says "Oh Dog" in conversation. I think that's the worst, especially since he has a dog. I wonder what she thinks about being cursed with? Poor Pebbles.

It was totally gay. The gift shop had a plethora of stupid crap I didn't want to buy, except the checkout girl was kind of old so I kept laughing at her flapping jowels. That was pretty cool. I was going to go up to her and say, "Ooh! Live chicken!" but I got scared when somebody set off the store alarm by mistake and then I turned around real fast and ran away. The snack bar was too expensive. Like five dollars for a stupid little sandwich. Screw that, I'd rather eat a stool. And I don't mean a barstool, either!         Oh well. ONe of the most memorable parts of our visitation was this paining called "Venus." It was the bomb because you could see her boobs. Her butt, too. She was laying down on a big clam shell or something, and it looked pretty windy out where she was because her hair was flowing all over the place. It reminded me of the famous hockey movie Youngblood, where the new star hockey player does it with that chick, and then she's lying down and you see her boobs. Yeah. Boobs are cool. Huh huh huh.         In retrospect, our visit to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery was full of magic wonderment, and ferocious gaiety. I would most definitely recommend that anyone who like old flappy-jowl ladies or movies with gratuitous tittie shots to run, not walk, to the Gallery, jog up the stairs, raise their arms like Rocky Balboa, and say "Ow! My cramp!" Thank you for reading, and remember that Tops never stops...saving you more.

You've always got your wits about you, Much like a ball has that sort of not quite rectangular but not quite cylinder shape to it. Like a ripple in the water, You have gently touched my life and, I just thought you would appreciated a birthday card on your birthday. so, there you have it, I've said what's on my mind, and now I'm feelin fine, but baby, baby i'll be rootin for ya.

As such, let me reflect on what we have all learned this semester:  1) 1+1=2, unless you're seeing other people 2) soup tastes better hot 3) mashed potatoes taste better when spelled w/out the "e" 4) in one fell swoop, all the love of anal sex one can possibly have comes crashing down in a whimper of laconic, prosaic poetic pain. 5) No goodbye; there's only bj's.

For hours, Fred painstakingly went through shallow layers of debris in the hopes of finding something of value--anything--that he could salvage from his bedroom. The area has been sealed off and is being treated as a mass garbage pit by US troops, who are sending experts to try to identify the remains.  Experts estimate that about eighteen boxes of materials, ranging from old clothes to souvenirs, newspaper clippings and important documents, were discovered on the site. Investigators believe the materials were buried relatively recently, but some items were put there as long ago as 1998, when Clinton's regime controlled much of the region.  Several catalogues of faded photographs, presumably of dead or missing relatives and friends, were also found. Most of the surrounding items appeared to have suffered from indescriminate pack-ratting.  Though some of the older remains were too old to be fully distinguishable, officials hope to piece together the last five years. "I am afraid this may be the first of many of these depositories," rightly said Fred. "There are tens of thousands of items unaccounted for in the southern section of this room."   A tiny, poorly lit cell was also discovered nearby, with metal hooks dangling from the ceiling. Although much of the complex was dilapidated, there were suggestions Fred had lived out of it until recently, with new shirts found still hanging inside.   Many of the remains on display Monday showed signs of physical trauma. Some still had faded tape tied around binder pockets and singular, unmatched socks smelled of decaying feet. Several books had large dog-ears on one side or had covers bent far back. In each open cardboard box, awards and certificates were carefully wrapped in white cloth, surrounded by scraps of receipts, bits of strings and dust bunnies.   The visible evidence of effluent cleansing drove a number of family members to wailing. "Do you see this?" a red-eyed Jerry S., 51, demanded angrily. Jerry was looking for a NordicTrack that disappeared from his house in 1999. "This is the face of chaos."    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  In an industry filled with buzzwords and over-inflated claims, honesty and attention to detail mean more than ever.

Then it occured to me: what if we had a News Anchor Babe of the Month! I went to the CNN Headline News website to see if I could get some names and profiles. Congratulations, Linda Stouffer! You're our first Anchor Babe! You can find out more about her at www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_r...inda.html.  But here's the rub. I decided to do some more searching to see if I could write up a funny article about Ms. Stouffer, and it got a little scary. Apparently there are a small number of people in this country that watch television news because, and pardon the pun, it turns them on. There are entire web pages devoted to female anchors that look a lot like porn sites. You can find one of these at dcwi.com/~dave/newsbabes.html. The only real difference is that the "fan pages" have pictures of fully clothed women in a sitting position. The anchors don't move from their seat, but you can find some hot, steamy pics of Ms. Stouffer smiling, smirking, talking, not talking, and blinking!   Check out Linda Stouffer, News Babe of the Month, at www.geocities.com/kryst0ph/lscnn.html. As the author of one post noted (yes, you can find a message board as well), "Linda Stouffer is the absolute most beautiful woman I have ever seen. She's classy, stylish, mysterious and competent. Not since I was a little boy have I found myself sitting so close to the TV when she's on. Having my coffee and watching her in the morning almost gives me a heart attack." Well hello, nurse!   FREDLINE FINANCIAL: CANDYBAR ALTERNATIVES  From our Indiana office comes another goldmine profit opportunity:  "To encourage you in your fundraising. I have completed my fundraising in a unique way. I put a flyer in our church bulletin asking for our members to consider donating their used “white elephant” household items to me so I could put them on EBay. One of the craziest items I got was several boxes of Colostomy Bags. The father of one of our members had a temporary colostomy and was “re-plumbed” and had leftovers. God provided over $100 for them on EBay!!"  The Internet is a blessed thing. Just think if he had to sell those door to door...   FREDLINE LIFESTYLES  Our Out-of-Context Quotes of the Week:  "Today's tip: Did you know writing in ALL CAPS is considered shouting?" --Yahoo.com  "I'm dont like pb&j how about fluffernutter! We will smell fresh and clean!" --Dawn, New York, New York  "Fred-there are a lot of pictures of frogs here, but not that many live ones  " --Carrie, London, England  "I don't know how much more of this I can stand!!! Just discovered yet ANOTHER Byzantine Emperor in my background! WHATAMIGONNADOOOOOOOOOO???? Learn Greek, I guess!" --Don't Know, Don't Want to Know  "and ofcourse I love praising God and eating moms beefs stew!" --Some friend of the previous guy   EDITOR'S NOTES  I'd hate to end this on an honest note but this is important. Are you like me, constantly flipping off the newsman because you think he's full of uninformative, jingoist crap? Do you hate hearing the same five songs on the radio, fifteen times a day, for three months? Do you despise having to pay hidden "convenience fees" when buying concert tickets online? Are you not against political parties but can't stand partisanism? It's all interconnected. In the name of bigger profits, media conglomerates are gouging our wallets, straining journalistic integrity and erasing our culture. I'll let the MoveOn organization explain further:   "On June 2, the Federal Communications Commission is planning on authorizing sweeping changes to the American news media. The rule changes could allow your local TV stations, newspaper, radio stations, and cable provider to all be owned by one company. NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox could have the same corporate parent. The resulting concentration of ownership could be deeply destructive to our democracy.  "After the FCC and Congress relaxed radio ownership rules, corporate giant Clear Channel Communications swept in and bought hundreds of stations. Clear Channel has used its might to support pro-war political rallies and conservative talk shows, keep anti-war songs off its stations, coerce musicians into playing free promotional concerts, and bully them into performing at its music venues. In many towns that used to have a diverse array of radio options, Clear Channel is now the only thing on the dial.   "When we talk to Congresspeople about this issue, their response is usually the same: "We only hear from media lobbyists on this. It seems like my constituents aren't very concerned with this issue." A few thousand emails could permanently change that perception. Please join us in asking Congress and the FCC to fight media deregulation at:   "www.moveon.org/stopthefcc...lrrKCActw" * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   Have a ball and a biscuit -F

We have two cats, actually. One is black and white, and stupid. His name is Billy but we usually just call him Stupid. The one I let in is named Kramer, and he's pretty cool. But he's gross. So I started walking to the living room when I almost trip over Kramer, who's hunched down on the ground, refusing to move. It looked like he was trying to trap something. I stood back to get a good view and found the cat with half a mouse in his mouth, and the other half (the part with the tail) hanging out. The first thing I thought was "Why did he bring that inside?" Then the cat, with the mouse still in its mouth, whipped his head up real fast so the mouse flew like 10 feet in the air before landing on a chair in the dining room. The cat ran to pounce on it, and with the body between its teeth did one of those things that dogs do where they eat meat by shaking their head and growling. But the cat didn't eat it yet, it still wanted to play. (To which my second thought was, "Why doesn't he just eat it?") Then he body-slammed the mouse back on the floor again. I went outside to find a shovel to get rid of the mouse, not to bury it, but to find something to pick it up that had a long pole attached to it. When I came back to the house the cat was still going ape wild over this mouse, which upon further inspection was still alive, heart beating a mile a minute, with three giant holes in its underside and too scared to move. I got it on the shovel, walked outside, and catapulted it away.   For the rest of the night Kramer stood on his hind legs against the screen door, meowing to go outside. I knew what he was up to. And he kept looking back at me like "I have to go outside, and uh, do some stuff. I mean really, REALLY have to go outside now. It's important Cat Stuff, you wouldn't understand." Yeah right, Kramer. Now be a good cat and lick my dinner plate clean....On second thought, don't this time.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Will Rogers, who died in a plane crash with Wylie Post in 1935, was probably the greatest political sage this country has ever known. Enjoy the following quotes:  1. Never slap a man who's chewing tobacco.  2. Never kick a cow chip on a hot day.  3. There are 2 theories to arguing with a woman ... neither works.  4. Never miss a good chance to shut up.  5. Always drink upstream from the herd.  6. If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.  7. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it and put it back in your pocket.  8. There are three kinds of men. The ones that learn by reading. The few who learn by observation. The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence.  9. Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.  10. If you're riding' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to make sure it's still there.  11. Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier'n puttin' it back.  12. AND FINALLY After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he started roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him.  The moral: When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   FREDLINE NEWS: FRED GETS FREE QUR'AN, NO SERIOUS INJURIES  Today at 4:30 PM EST the FREDLINE NEWS offices received a package from the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia's Islamic Affairs. It had Arab writing on the box and everything. Knowing exactly what it was, our Senior Editor opened it, much to the dismay of Jerry, one of our Copy Editors. Questions raised ranged from "What's that?" to "Are you sure it's not a bomb?" FREDLINE NEWS would also like to report that they expected some cheap paperback copy of the Qur'an but this is a really nice hardcover, and that you can request free copies from www.iad.org. When asked about the book, our Senior Editor replied that "free stuff" is always good and reminisced about the Good Ol' Days when you spelled Qur'an with a K.   FREDLINE LIFESTYLES  The following is a true story by a "Jamie K." who submitted this story to the "UB Embarrassed" contest for the University at Buffalo's "Visions" newsletter:  "I have a serious gastric problem, so whenever I can't hold it back I try to make a joke like "pull my finger" or something. One day after a shower, with just a towel on, I went in to my room to get dressed. My girlfriend was in the room as I dropped my towel and felt a fart coming on. While hiking up my leg to fart I said, "this is how much I love you" and at the same time I dropped a BIG surprise on the floor. It surprised me as much as her. I looked at my girl who had a look of horror on her face and my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe I had just took a dump on the floor in front of my girlfriend. I screamed to her "don't look at it!" and jumped into bed and hid under the covers. We broke up later that day and I haven't heard from her since."   FREDLINE WORD OF THE DAY: "FERGUSONIAN"  fur*GOO*so*Nee*enne  The act of offering advice without adequate life experience to back it up. Example:  "Joe": Fred. Listen. Listen to me for a second. This is what women want: "Fred": How do you know what women want? "Joe": I don't. But hear me out here... "Fred": Why, are you a woman? "Joe": Shut up. "Fred": "Joe," sometimes you're so...Fergusonian...    EDITOR'S NOTES  Go ahead and forward this if you're bored.

The conclusion came about after the   hamburger grill broke, meaning "FRED" had to explain that burgers were not for   sale.  "I made signs that said, 'NO BURGERS - GRILL BROKEN'" commented "FRED." What   more did I need to do? Is everyone dumb?"  It is estimated that 1 in 2 customers had receive a personal explanation of   what the signs meant, while 1 in 5 needed to learn that the "Whopper" was a   kind of burger and hence unavailable. Also, 1 in 8 pointed to the signs and   asked "Does that mean there are no burgers?"  After two hours, "FRED" got really frustrated. "After two hours I got really   frustrated," he recalled, "so I made MORE signs. I even drew big X's on sheets   of paper and put them over the pictures of all the food on the menu. Do you   think that helped? NO!"  Justifiably so, many customers were also quite upset at the situation. One   became visibly angry. "What do you mean there are no burgers?!" the woman   yelled before she stomped away. "I've been waiting in line for 20 minutes!   The LEAST you could do is put up a sign!"  In an unrelated story, "FRED" is continuing to tell himself he has a career   future outside of Burger King and is only working there to help pay for   college.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * INFLATIBLE CHURCH!

We are here out of basic necessity. Let's make the   best of the situation. We are all here by choice no one is forcing us to be   here. Why don't we stop worrying about what we can't change? Let's not worry   about everyone else, lets concentrate on our selves and how we can do the best   work we can do to earn that money that is letting us survive. In the scheme of   things let's be glad that we are surviving. Let's all make the best of our   work environment. Let's be happy to be here each day. And be glad that the   others are able to be here too.  Going into summer lets decide to make it a good one, and remember to be happy,   it doesn't do any good to be sad or mad, be glad." [sic]  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * EDITOR'S NOTES  It's a new month, and you know what that means: the *NEW* FREDLINE NEWS   Anchorette Centerfold for June is Maria Bartiromo of CNBC. And why not? Not   only is our dear Maria a bright shining face in a sea of middle-aged, balding   male financial experts, she's also a Rock Chick! Fun fact: Joey Ramone wrote a   song about her on his last solo album. Look it up!   "One of my hobbies is the stock market," Ramone said in March 1999. His   fascination at the time was a daily financial analysis program on cable station   CNBC.  "I watch this show Squawk Box every morning, and they have this host named   Maria [Bartiromo] who is really hot and feisty," Ramone said. "When I stopped   drinking, I started getting into the stock market because it's sort of like a   mosh pit down there."  A demo of the song mixes the British Invasion sound of the Who's early material   with a touch of the Ramones' career-long fascination with Motown girl groups.   "I watch her every day/ I watch her every night/ She's really out of sight/   Maria Bartiromo," Ramone sings.  Hey Maria, you can ring MY "opening bell" any day! Also, it's good we found a   new Anchorette Centerfold because the one for May--Linda Stouffer of Headline News--gave   birth a couple weeks ago and will be on maternity leave for a while. Honest,   it's not mine. Congrats Linda, and congrats Maria! We just want to say Good   Luck, and We're all counting on you.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  QUOTES IN FUTILITY, PART TWO  "I don't think the system is 100% effective; I mean, it can't as long as the   human element is involved." --Jury Duty orientation video, City of Buffalo

Grose, a graduate student at Indiana State University, wanted to be eligible for the NFL Draft hoping to be drafted by the nearby Indianapolis Colts.  "Yeah, I've been limping around a little, so I'll have to stop running for a while. I think I pulled something," the dejected athlete remarked. "Maybe next year."  Grose runs several times a week, depending on his study schedule and weather conditions. Though never playing in professional or collegiate sports, he was a member of several intramural football teams and played countless 1-on-1 basketball games with his younger brother. Once last November Grose remarked that it would "be really cool if I got drafted in the last rounds of the [NFL] Draft. Dude I'd be rich." Though expressing at numerous occations that NFL players are overpaid babies, sources close to Grosse have hinted that a large NFL salary would not hinder his decision to enter the league.  The Colts front office was unavailable for comment. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   FREDLINE NEWS WORLD TOUR  The FREDLINE NEWS staff will be in the Czech Republic for the next 2-3 weeks, doing--of course--The Lord's Work.

As per recent comments by President George "Wuh?" Bush taunting would-be terrorists to "come and get us" [That's a paraphrase. We don't do a lot of fact-checking], we offer those same terrorists the following scenario:  --You (the terrorist) tries to hijack our international flight to Frankfurt --We (the FREDLINE NEWS staff) goes Passenger 57 on your hiney. --We (the FREDLINE NEWS staff) become national heroes, appearing on Letterman (NOT Leno, unless he offers more $$), Charlie Rose, and of course Larry King. --During the call-in session at Larry King, the recently-returned-home Jessica Lynch rings me up to applaud our bravery in the face of impending doom. --We reply, with a sly grin and a wink, "Hey, you're not so bad yourself." --We (our staff, and Jessica Lynch) chat for a while about being heroes, the weather in West Virginia, etc. --We get digits.  --Awesome.   Admit it, she is kind of cute.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * To those of you looking for a DIFFERENT news source, that we here at EDLINE NEWS cut through the crap (FR) and get straight to the point (ED).

As their press release claims, the staff of FREDLINE NEWS has done everything from being "politically biased, and unfair," to having connections with the government of Saudi Arabia, Ashley Judd, and a Russian bride smuggling ring.  All of these accuations are complete fabrications, or as we call them in the journalism business, "horsehockey." Nay, ED is a pucking liar. Though the ongoing relationship between a member of the FREDLINE NEWS staff and actress Ashley Judd is verifiable and a private matter, everything else is purely and utterly untrue.   We challenge the staff of EDLINE NEWS to corroborate their insinuations. We also match your four insinuations and rise you one more. That's right, we here at FREDLINE NEWS have found ample evidence to prove that ED is EVIL. One look at the following website should explain everything.   asgard.drakhar.com:8080/a...eviled.jpg   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Our News Anchorette of the Month for July is Baghdad Bob.

      FREDLINE NEWS UPDATE: LEGAL STUFF SHOULD BE AT THE END  If this is in your Inbox: Just so I don't get sued by the FCC people, remember that at one time you gave a guy named Fred your E-mail address, and lucky you, "You've Got Mail!" You can reply to this letter with an "Unsubscribe Me/Stop The Insanity" message.

Hey, you know those commericals with the guy that buys that Internet Station thingy that probably cost him like $20,000? And every day he goes to it, opens it up, and WOW there's, like, TWENTY bucks worth of $1 bills inside? And that  makes him rich somehow? THAT COULD BE YOU! We here at Ameri-POS have told you for two years now that other people are going to take all the good spots at malls and airports. It's an amazing coincidence that there are spots still left NEAR YOU!    "I want the American Dream, and I want it now!" --Woman from commercial, who forgot the struggle of her immigrant forefathers * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   FREDLINE NEWS: REBELLIOUS CASHIER FEARS FOR WELL-BEING  So this lady walks into the store and wants to buy some coffee. She reaches into her pocket, and somewhere between all the Casino Niagara tokens she finds $1.50 in Canadian money and hands it to me. So I tell her I can't take Canadian money unless she wants to pay the exchange rate, and suddenly I've infringed on her rights as an American. "What do you mean?! Everyone does it!!," to which I reply that yes, they do, in Canada. Now she must See a Manager Immediately. That means I have to go find the manager, who really does have better things to do, and explain why this woman has to interrupt TWO people that don't care two cents for her $1.50 coffee. Then the manager has to do the Happy Customer Dance until the problem goes away.   When I came back, the woman was on the other side of the room, filling up a coffee cup she'd stolen from behind the register. She sees me. "Changed your mind, huh?" So I flip her off. She wasn't very happy.   That night, and for the next day or so, my middle finger became a badge of honor. For the few people at work that I told (you have to be careful what gets out) it helped relieve some work tension. It was a fun little story to tell friends and family. ("And then I did THIS, Mom!") But then the thoughts started creeping in. What if I've gone on a power trip, and start telling off customers every day? More importantly, what if she comes back? With her larger, angrier boyfriend? Uh-oh. I had to watch my back. This is what I get for not loving my neighboUr!   Next week, she did come back, and her boyfriend/husband/brother was there, too. It was a particularly busy lunch period, so it was easy to pretend I didn't recognize her and look occupied. As I said "Thanks" to her as I did any other customer, she responded with a noticeably sharp "Thank YOU!!" in return.   So my fears were not entirely baseless. In conclusion, don't flip people off, unless you know them personally. You never know when they'll show up again. And they'll show up with their mullet-headed, dumbfounded, trailer-hick redneck stringbean of a husband/brother/probably both to stare at you awkwardly for a couple minutes.

In June we declared the FREDLINE NEWS Anchorette of the Month to be Maria Bartiromo of CNBC. You can see hot, steamy pictures of her sitting at a desk at www.framisdave.com/avemaria.htm. "Daniel J." who runs the site, also wrote a wonderful dedication poem named "Ave Maria." Thanks for writing, Joe! You're creepy.

VIDEO  Residents throughout the tri-state area recently got the chance to participate in what will be remembered by the Guinness Book of World Records as the "World's Largest Re-enactment of a Music Video." Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers hit the streets simultaneously to perform the end scene of R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts."  The New York Municipal Power Authority cooperated by diverting all of the city's power grid to be used by local, national and international media agencies to film the event for posterity.  "I can't believe it," re-enacted one anchorwoman as she viewed helicopter shots of gridlocked cars being passed by legions of streetwalking pedestrians. She continued with the video's dialogue. "They all just . . . got out and walked! [gasps] This is . . . unbelievable."  Mayor Bloomberg's office is considering more mass re-enactments to bring much-need tourism to the area. The last major intra-city performance--a staging of the Will Smith action vehicle "Independence Day"--in the autumn of 2001 brought rave reviews.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Beautiful Russian Women Are Looking For Love!

There were two passengers in the car at the time of the accident, police reported. The passengers, Sharon Gaulle and Jonah Fergis, also of Buffalo, possessed an above-average blood alcohol content.  According to the police, Francis, the designated driver, was extremely fatigued after a long night of drinking at a local bar, in which he did not participate. Witnesses at the bar reported a loser matching Francis' description "drowning" himself in ginger ale and, as one patron remembered, "sucking down bowls of free peanuts like an elephant with an eating disorder" until last call at 4:00 a.m.  Because Shrode was not drunk when the accident occurred, his injuries were much more serious. Gaulle and Fergis suffered minor scrapes and bruises, while Shrode received a minor concussion, a broken hand, and a bruised ego because he was the dumb one out of a group of three drunks, and he wasn't even drunk.  Al Sharpton, always having something to say, had something to say. "Anybody in their right mind would pull over if they were tired. They would AT LEAST try to hail a cab! Sharpton is currently at 3% in Presidential election polls, with a margin of error at plus or minus 3%.    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Linda Stouffer, FREDLINE NEWS Anchorette of the Month for May 2003, had her baby boy. On May 8, just before Mother's Day, little Wyatt Russell Strassman was born to Ms. Stouffer and her husband, CBS News Correspondent Mark Strassman. Ms. Stouffer just recently returned to her anchoring job at CNN Headline News. What tenacity, coming back after only three months! For this Ms. Stouffer has been awarded FREDLINE NEWS Anchorette of the month for August as well. Congratulations again!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   EDITORIAL NOTE  On a truly sad note, Wesley Willis died last week at age 40. For those of you who don't know, Wesley was an artist and musician from Chicago. Though born into poverty, abused as a child, schizophrenic, mentally slow, obese, and the victim of violent attacks, he went through live happy and more importantly, made countless others happy with him. His songs were both vicious and redeeming at the same time. I and several of you have met and talked to him at least once and it was always great to see him again, with a smile on his face, ready to "rah" and "ro" with his countless fans all over the world. Wesley died from heart complications after being diagnosed with leukemia and undergoing an operation for internal bleeding this year.

      FREDLINE NEWS UPDATE: IF YOU'RE "WEBCAMSUZY99," STOP IMing ME  FREDLINE NEWS is brought to you by the letters V and H and the number 1.  Please reply to this address to lavish praise upon our news team for their astounding journalistic prowess.  We also handle unsubscriptions.  Sorry, Virginia!  (There is no Santa Claus.)  Back issues are posted for reasons of archeological research at http://pub72.ezboard.com/bpublius and now at http://dissek.com/webboard for no reason whatsoever.  Skynyrd rules.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * PANTENE PRO-V IS THE BOMB  I lost my shampoo bottle in a hotel room in Chicago right after I checked out.  After going back to the front desk to ask if they'd seen anything while cleaning up, a delightful cleaning lady appeared like Tinkerbell out of nowhere and let me down a maze of corridors to the secret lair of the maintenance department, a Never-Never Land where lost items remain forever young.  She let me look through a locker overflowing with pirate treasure, but alas, no Eckerd-brand $1.19 Value Size.  Then came the magic words: "Take whatever you want."    There were clothes and towels, but that seemed a little shady.  I didn't come to loot, after all, I came for 'poo, so I grabbed the only bottle I could find.  There it was.  Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner Classic Clean 400 mL (13.5 FL OZ).  The last month has been a renaissance.  Pantene's enriched "Pro-Vitamin" formula keeps my normal hair lustrous and healthy-looking from roots to ends.  It cleans without stripping and conditions with balanced moisture in one step.  My hair stays balanced, strong, healthy-looking, responding to my hair's structure to help bring out the beauty that's mine alone.  Now all I have to do is dispense product into palm and rub hands together, apply shampoo to wet hair, massaging scalp with fingertips in a rotating motion, work lather through to ends, rinse thoroughly, and repeat if desired, and all is right with the world.  I use it daily.  Even better, I know that it's gentle enough to use on my permed or color-treated hair.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *    FREDLINE NEWS CORRECTIONS  --UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan does not have an alpaca ranch in Arkansas.  He sold it in 1983.  --A recent obituary claims that Ms. Greta Pellington of Tonawanda died this Tuesday.  The publication of this pre-written obituary was unfortunate, as she is still very much alive and kicking, buried with her coffin.  --The FREDLINE NEWS Editorial Department greatly regrets its coarse reply to a letter sent in by a Joshua D. of Buffalo, who after describing himself as a "nonpracticing Unitarian" got the response, "Isn't that an oxymoron?"  The staff does not apologize for the error.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * FREDLINE NEWS ANCHORETTE OF THE MONTH AWARD  Special congratulations go to Michaela Pereira of TechTV for winning the FREDLINE NEWS Anchorette Award for September 2003.

TomServo0:  "con·trac·tion n.  A word, as won't from will not, or phrase, as o'clock from of the clock, formed by omitting or combining some of the sounds of a longer phrase.  The formation of such a word."  jeff80:  i don't buy it  jeff80:  because in academic writing you can't use contractions because they're just viewed as abbreviations  TomServo0:  that doesn't mean they're not singular words, it just suggests they're informal  TomServo0:  "Edward80:  I would say perhaps an expression.

TomServo0:  ah, jeff, how many words are in this sentence:  "Bob's car is red."  jeff80:  that's a possessive  jeff80:  completely different  TomServo0:  it's an apostrophe  jeff80:  but it does't denote that something's missing  TomServo0:  in a contraction, yes.  but it creates an entirely new word while still referring to a phrase  jeff80:  no  jeff80:  what's the difference between Dr. and doctor  TomServo0:  what if they'd decided to spell "Dr." "D'r"?  TomServo0:  (that's a red herring)  jeff80:  yeah - i know  TomServo0:  Dr. and doctor are two different words that mean almost the same thing  TomServo0:  and one can't be used in scrabble, but so what?  jeff80:  what is the point of this conversation, anyhow?  TomServo0:  to discuss the 2 word proposition!  TomServo0:  and NOW, because i'm winning the argument, you're clintoning out!  jeff80:  no - because i never was really involved fully - since i'm working on important stuff  TomServo0:  mmhmm  TomServo0:  this will probably go in the next fredline news  TomServo0:  speaking of important stuff

      FREDLINE NEWS UPDATE: BOO  Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, FREDLINE NEWS comes along to tug at the bottom of your swim trunks. Past issues can be found at pub72.ezboard.com/bpublius. To unsubscribe, beg for mercy by responding to this address. Forwarding permitted (bring two forms of I.D.)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ HEY KIDS, EAT MORE CHEESE!  Cheese--EXTREME DAIRY! Now in Neon Yellow! Eat it any way you want! Cheese is AWESOME!   Now back to SpongeBob Squarepants. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  FREDLINE NEWS: HEY HEY HEY  I'm still trying to wrap my head around this one. About a month ago I was driving through Lackawanna, New York. It was about 2:30 in the afternoon. In front of me was a car going about six miles per hour. No--less. As I drove around it I noticed several things:  1) The driver's door was open 2) There was a rope coming out of the passenger window 3) The driver was obese 4) There was a dog walking on the sidewalk 5) The dog was attached to the rope  Until that moment, I was like one of you. I would watch the news reports saying "Americans are fatter than ever!" and think nothing of it. It's when you see A WOMAN TOO LAZY TO GET OUT OF THE CAR TO WALK HER DOG that you realize our country really is in trouble. I don't want to sound like a sympathizer, but Lackawanna (allegedly) was the home to the Lackawanna Six Al-Qaida cell. My guess is those six, thin, first-generation Americans saw this fatso waving them by in her Lincoln and thought to themselves, "my family is starving across the sea, I work like a dog at my crappy job to make my mortgage payments, everybody hates my homeland, culture, religion, and accent, and here is this humungous white lady with no job, no desire to WALK, no common sense, and enough blubber for three whaling expeditions! Democracy my arse!"   The next time I see this woman I'm taking her dog. And that's the freaking news! Happy Halloween!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here is a funny cartoon: homestarrunner.com/homestarloween.html Here is another one: www.villagevoice.com/issu...sutton.php And here is yet another: members.cox.net/impunity/endofworld.swf ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  FIELD DAY 2003 MEMORIES  It's been several months now, but who could forget Field Day: the proposed mega-music festival that went from a 2-day outdoors picnic to a half-day, rainsoaked mess ending up with Beck in the hospital. I just found my poncho in the closet! Also this testimony:  "As if the whole event wasn't enough of a total disaster," one spectator was quoted as saying, "my girlfriend ate a hot dog from one of Giants Stadium's fine concessionaires and ended up getting food poisoning, so we had to leave early to handle the puking. After dealing with all the other Field Day s***, I didn't even get to see more than couple of Radiohead songs -- the only possible saving grace of the crummy Festival. My girlfriend was spewing, shaking and green-faced for the rest of the night (a very expensive night I might add). Anybody else get sick off the nasty-assed food they were slinging?"  In related news, second-stage act Elliot Smith just killed himself this week.   Field Day was THAT bad.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FREDLINE NEWS: COLLECTING FOR UNICEF!  To make up for this issue, the next FREDLINE NEWS will feature a feature interview with Moses. No, not Malone, but the real Moses. (His last name is Spiegelbaum.) He's got a new memoir out, "Blood From a Stone: My Years as Israeli Prime Minister." Should be interesting. If you have any questions for Moses, please E-mail FREDLINE NEWS at TomServo0@aol.com. We'll ask as many as we'll have space for. And now, if you do a quick Google search, "Girls Jumping On Trampolines."

      Listening to: OutKast  The guy at Kinko's said the copies and the binding would take about 35 minutes, but it ended up being about 1:40. So I was really late for work. Not that I wanted to work. I didn't work that hard when I got there. Also, Joe (from "Joe's Blog") told me to write about what a jerk he is on my blog, so here it is. Man, that Joe, what a jerk! My apartment smells like bean soup. I'm a bit constipated. My alarm clock is set to play Iggy Pop and The Stooges' "Search and Destroy" tomorrow morning. Before I go to work at noon, I have to fill my car with gas. You're this close to reading Adult Swim News here. (If you get that one, E-mail me. We'll hang out.)

      Listening to: Outkast  Yesterday was Thanksgiving. More importantly, I beat Shadowgate. Shadowgate was an old Nintendo game that used to give me nightmares because whenever you died a giant Grim Reaper would come on the screen. Also, you could get eaten alive by alligators or set on fire. You never saw any of that, but it SUGGESTED it would happen. Anyway, I downloaded a list of all the secrets for the game and walked through it. That's when I realized that there is no possible way I could have beaten it by myself...in fact, I don't know anyone who has. Once I went to this family's house and they were trying to beat it for a second time, but forgot how. It's that hard. I believe no one has ever finished the game without cheating. Meanwhile, the Grim Reaper is still a bit freaky.

      Was listening to: 94.5  So my brother and a friend and I went to Krispy Kreme at about 2 in the morning. One worker there ran up to the drive-thru window and yelled "HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE A FREE CINNAMON DOUGHNUT?" He was pretty hyper. As my friend Richie described it, "It looked liked the teeth were falling out of his head." Too much sugar for that dude. So I guess Richie is a friend...he's really my brother's friend...then again that means I only have like two friends if I can't count people I've met through other friends. Richie said goodbye but I didn't really say goodbye back; I had a doughnut in my mouth. Creme-filled. Mmm.

      Watching: America's Funniest Videos"  So my dad was watching this and I haven't seen it in years. If you only watch it every five years it can have some funny parts... But the best part of the show is that it's totally bourgeois. Everyone is ugly and poor, just like the rest of us! I mean, they'll dress up to go get their prize in Los Angeles, but their home videos make them look really really bad. I guess we all wear ratty clothes when we're around the house, so now I can feel better about myself.

      Listening to: Tech TV  So anyway I was at the mall yesterday. I saw this woman dragging a kid outside the mall and she was MAD. Meanwhile the kid would not stop screaming, so I kind of figured out what was up. When their car pulled around I also saw the woman turn around and give the sign language sign for "SIT DOWN!" In conclusion, not only could the kid scream at the top of his lungs to get what he wanted, he was also deaf. He's a genious.

      Listening to: Jamaican-tinged SMB3 credits music  So Ed found a really good emulator and made the mistake of telling me about it. I downloaded Super Mario Bros. 3 and played it all day, all the way through. I didn't think I still had it in me but I did; in fact it was the best I'd ever done it. Once I played it through when I was like 12 or 13 and it took 3 days, but I did it within the course of an afternoon. Pretty good considering how many years it's been. It's like those movies where the character gets anmesia... "I think I have to jump here, but I don't know why...[bonk][1-UP falls from sky]...Awesome!" Now if only I could remember the GREs like that.

      Listening to: CBC Radio 2  In case you haven't noticed, I gave up on FREDLINE NEWS (for now) and am back to the blogs. For all 3 of you that read the bloody things.  Last night we went to see Chris Rock perform. Before I went I told everybody that he'd talk about "being black and smoking crack." It was my theory that almost all of his punchlines ended with "black", "crack", or something else that kind of rhymes, like "cracka!" I was only half right. The rest are "b****" and "f***!" Of course everything in between was pretty insightful; a biting social commentary. But when going for the big punchline laugh, you just gotta say, "f*** b****, where's my crack!?"

      CD: White Stripes, "De Stijl"  Went to the casino last night. The ID guy looks at the card, looks at me and says "Well hey! You've got the same birthday as me!" and I say "April 25? Huh!" and he lets me pass. Then my friends start talking about the weird questions that THEY were asked and it finally dawns on me: his birthday probably wasn't on April 25!  Then I lost 3 of my $5 and ate at Denny's. Don't eat the Breakfast Dagwood. Le fin!

      CD: Bikini Kill  Tonight we celebrated Dave's birthday by doing nothing for about 3 hours and then going to a bar from about 1:30 to 3:00. I think Dave had fun. Some other stuff happened. I wasn't involved.  Joe fell in the snow. I drove. I met Jenny. Dave wore a hat. But the other stuff--seriously--I had nothing to do with it.

      Listening to: Nardwaar The Human Serviette  Sushi Night with Joe, Scott, and Megan. Then Denny's Dessert Time with us + Sarah and Dave. Magical. I finally figured out not to eat the wasabi like pudding; also, in Japan the food "miso" is not to be followed by the word "horny." I learned a lot tonight, laughed, loved, and lost about $23. Also found myself in Niagara County for some reason. Saved by my stash of glove compartment maps!

Who was that lady? My evil old French teacher, Mrs. Gaddis! I laughed maniacally! Just like this: AAAAAAAAAH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!

      Voivod  A New York Times article finally disspelled the myth that if you press the button to cross the street, nothing with happen. There are something like 2000 of those buttons in NYC that were turned off decades ago. But it saved a million dollars to not take them down and it keeps the stupid people from getting disgruntled by believing they can control traffic. I applaud city hall for not telling us earlier.

      My good people:  I only want to say this once again, this time in print so everyone can see it. I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. I can give the average person several answers to the question "So what have you been up to?" but this here is the truth. Since January, and for the next few months, I will be sleeping in, watching more television, and spending more time in my pajamas. And I enjoy it. Sure, I work part time. Sure, I'm slowly but steadily writing a Master's Thesis. Sometimes I even work as a substitute teacher. But you know what? On the average weekday I'm deciding my own fate. I'm reading more, taking short walks, talking to a friend or two, going through my record collection, and whatever else I feel like doing. I'm writing this at three in the morning on a Wednesday, and it doesn't matter because I haven't needed to wear a watch in weeks.   This is not a permanent situation so I might as well enjoy it. I used to pull all-nighters doing math homework in high school, then did even more in college. Sometimes I kept three jobs while simultaneously pulling a full course load. In summer I would put sixty-hour work weeks with no overtime pay because those hours weren't all at one place. My idea of a vacation would be a couple weeks of missionary work and cold showers in the middle of nowhere. As late as December I was getting up at 5:30 and driving for two hours to two jobs only to go home and type a paper, then do it all again in the morning.   In a month or so I might be visiting new schools or interviewing for jobs, but for now all I need is a laptop and a bed. My schedule is free and I'm never bored. It's great, and somehow I'm saving money to boot. I'd write more about how doing nothing has made me content, but I feel like doing something else with my time. As you yours, I'm sure.

      Smashing Pumpkins, "Mashed Potatoes"  Last night I had a dream that I was late for a class. I didn't know what time the class started, but I knew I was late, and I was trying to find the professor's phone number and tell him I wouldn't make it in time but I didn't know where it was. That and I had a cut on my finger that needed a bandage. Then I woke up and remembered I don't have classes anymore, that it was noon, and I didn't have anywhere to be. So I guess it ended well. I found a cut on my finger, though.

      FREDLINE NEWS IS BACK after a two-month absence. But we have pay stubs to prove we came in . . . . Visit the new website at geocities.com/fcschrock. Everything but FREDLINE NEWS is up, ironically enough.  Also visit the official FREDLINE NEWS Special Valentine's Day Greeting at  veepers01.budlight.com/se...635E514682 which will be up for one more week.          *        *        *        *        *  THIS JUST IN: Candy Bars Discovered On Mars  Picture: geocities.com/marsfind.jpg  NASA photos released today from the Mars surface have revealed a large cache of candy bars, possibly from a time when life once existed on the now lifeless red planet. "This is totally awesome," said NASA programmer Billy Richards during the morning press conference. "Our first attempt at finding the candy bars using only one robot was futile, but by spreading two rovers out in Twix formation, we finally know where they are."  The massive stash of Hershey's, Butterfingers, and Milky Ways were originally believed too weak to withstand the harsh, hot daytime temperatures on Mars. It seems that the cool, refreshing sensation of numerous York Peppermint Patties have kept the chocolate from melting over the ages. In any case, the photos seem to have proven what scientists have only speculated for centuries: girls aren't allowed on Mars.  "Boys go to Mars to get candy bars," noted Richards. "Girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider."  Still, some NASA employees are still not convinced. Mary Wroblinski, a data systems analyst for NASA's spectrometry division, claims the photos create more questions than answers.  "Judging by the blinding reflections of the sun on the landscape, and the possiblility of more adaptable, non-candy bar confections that CAN survive on the Martian surface such as Everlasting Gob-Stoppers, these candies could be anything," the analyst debated. "This means girls can still go to Mars. Anyway, Billy just wants to hog the contols for the rover and ram it into rocks. He doesn't deserve candy bars, he's a jerk face, and I'm telling."   It should be mentioned, however, that Wroblinski is a year younger than Richards. Also, according to anonymous sources, she smells like poo.  In a related story, the beleagured Hubble Space Telescope will remain operative until 2012, when it's high-powered lenses will be refocused to find the place in France where the naked ladies dance.          *        *        *        *        *  CALIFORNIA BIBLE FANS LINE UP FOR NEW JESUS FILM  With almost two whole weeks before the opening of Mel Gibson's film "The Passion," fans are already starting to line up outside of box offices around America. Some fans are dressed up as characters from the movie, re-enacting favorite scenes from the story and showing off their knowledge of Jesus trivia. Here in Pasadena, where the film will open first in the nation, about fifty people have set up tents and lawn chairs in anticipation. Ellen Simpson, 32, is camping outside the theater with her husband and two children.   "I've been waiting forever for the book to become a movie!" Simpson told reporters. "Sure, they had an animated version, but it sucked. I just had to share this  experience with my kids. I hear the special effects are outstanding!" Her son, 8, dressed up as a Roman guard for the occasion, complete with toy sword, while her six-year-old daughter pretends she is Mary Magdalene with passers-by. Another group of twelve fans have set up a long buffet table on the sidewalk.  "The Passion" is based on the book "The Bible," an epic fable about good and evil. Though derided when it first came out, the book has gained a cult following in recent  years. Gibson, a Bible fan himself, has taken great measures to stick to the original manuscript.  Die-hard Bible readers may notice some descrepancies. "Oh man, don't get me started," says one ticketholder. "For one, it's supposed to be in the original language, but they totally got the wrong dialect of Aramaic, plus the Romans only spoke in Latin during legal matters, not in the Jerusalem marketplace. Then there's the complete omission of Matthew 27:25. Plus they totally glossed over the scene where Peter get's his ear cut off!"  When asked why the same ticketholder, wearing a Pharisee's robe, was still waiting in line, he declared "Hey, I'm a fan. It's still gonna be the best movie of the year.   And the sequel's supposed to ROCK."          *        *        *        *        *  HEY SERIOUS MESSAGE: For those of you who watch too much television, you already know the E-Loan lady is missing. That's right! For those of you that don't, the E-Loan lady was the one that walked right up to some new homeowners and got them into an E-Loan . . . on their own front porch! During ANOTHER commercial, she went into A BANK with a laptop computer and got a couple to get their mortgage at E-Loan instead! She may be the greatest salesperson ever. Don't believe me? Remember those commercials where the mom throws a bowl of cereal to her kids, and they turn into breakfast bars in mid-air? GUESS who that mother was?!   As part of a nutritious breakfast, she was also in a number of orange juice commercials years before. New ads for E-Loan now have a woman that looks a lot like the original E-Loan lady, but it's not her. What happened? Is she all right? She had been looking thinner in recent commercials. Is she on drugs? Has she succumbed to the seedy commercialism of Hollywood? If anyone knows the whereabouts of the E-Loan lady PLEASE E-mail me. She's somewhat tall, too thin, has long, straight, blonde hair, and smiles profusely and overemphasizes her hand gestures when she talks. Don't make us switch to Ditech!          *        *        *        *        *

      CD: Parliament, "Mothership Connection"  Yesterday I drove to UB to renew some books right before a meeting at church. I got lost (again) and went the wrong way, then got to the library late to find out I 1. did not have my Interlibrary Loan card and 2. could have done it online. A car drove down the wrong side of the road and almost hit me head-on. Then I was 30 minutes late for church and had a gas tank on E. The sermon was "The Gospel According to The Simpsons: Homer" so maybe it was worth it.

Let's just say that Maculay Culkin's (sp?) acting skills got worse after Home Alone. Also, according to Joe's bathroom scale I lost seven pounds this week, which I immediately celebrated by eating a plate of spaghetti upon arriving at home. It's 4:20 and I have to sleep. Stop.

      CD: Warren Zevon, "The Wind"  Another story about the town judge: did I mention he owns the gun shop? Here then (paraphrased) is the cardboard sign he put up on the window.   "A female news reporter interviewed a recruiting general at his army base during her radio show. 'Just what do you teach these young boys when they come to you?' she asked.  'The basics,' he replied, 'survival, camping, and of course how to safely operate and fire a gun . . . '  'Do you really think that's a good idea, to have such young people to use firearms?'  'Like I said, we teach them safe and responsible usage of their guns.'  'Aren't you ashamed that you're equipping these men to become killers?' she pressed.  'Well,' said the general, 'you're fully equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not doing that either . . . '  The interview quickly ended."

      CD: Butter 08, again and again!  Ed, where did the background go for your blog? Joe, yours too! I better get to work and tweak these things. Last week I procrastinated so much I got a whole website working without reading one page of research material. This week is a big question mark, though I must say it is already 2 in the afternoon. In other Buffalo State news, I forgot to hand in my Application for Graduation, which means I technically won't be able to graduate until August. Not a problem, really, it just gives me more time to procrastinate out a better paper. But don't you hate missing deadlines?

Some car near my house didn't make it and went onto some guy's yard. In conclusion, ice made driving dangerous, as seen by the observed accident. Science!

      The other night I had a dream where I was trying to get rid of a body. I'm pretty sure I didn't kill her, or at least, she didn't know I was killing her when I didn't. Anyway, I threw the body in a large campfire but the flames just wouldn't catch, so picked up a rake and started beating the ashes. Well I hit her on the leg and the lady regained consciousness. Then I had to pretend, like, "Oh no, you're on fire! Let me help you!" so I wouldn't look guilty. It was a close one; I almost really embarrassed myself there.

      I went to town court tonight for a speeding ticket. I've been in front of a judge a couple of times now, and I must say they're hilarious. It must be all the crap they have to put up with. I've yet to give an excuse for speeding (or anything else) not because of pride, but because I know I'm just wasting the court's valuable time. The best excuse I heard tonight:  Defendant: "Well Your Honor, it was really late and I was trying to get home, you know, cuz it was late, but I guess I just didn't notice how fast I was going . . . "  Judge: So how many years have you been driving?  Defendant: "Since I was 16, Your Honor." (The man was about 30 years old.)  Judge: "And in all these years of driving you can't tell when you're going 84 in a 45?"  Defendant: "It was dark out . . . "  Judge: "Were you in the Air Force?"

      Another old file I found on old discs:  Response to "We’re playing follow the leader at Canisius" I must admit I am proud of my fellow student who took a risky stand and exposed a less attractive side of the general populous. The issue of being a bunch of followers is not something people like to think about in their paper plastic lives. I my self took a consideration of this subject, I want to respond to Rob’s question about what can be done?  I am not sure that the resolution is to cease being followers. I think that would be impossible. We are inherently followers, I cannot think of someone who did not follow or conform to anything throughout history. If someone could find me an authentic leader I would be grateful. Think of current leaders, like the president, he is influenced by a myriad of sources. He is under law, he works for the people, he is influenced by campaign contributors, interest groups, and his cabinet. This is not to mention how he might have been raised, he may be inclined since a young age to follow a certain way. A leader has to lead a group of followers. If being a leader meant people had to aimlessly follow and conform to me, and I ought to be against this, I would be performing a vast hypocrisy. Or if I was against following I would be contradicting myself. If I admitted being a follower and hated it, at least id be an honest fool. If the college took a serious look at its student body it should not be surprised that it is a gaggle of conformists and followers. What else would it be? No wonder the campus is full of followers following Hilfilger, nike, and barbies around, what else are they going to do? If I am going to be a follower, and what I follow is wrong, what then can I follow that would be good, or at least noble? The question should rather be whether the student body is following something worth following.  hi my name is Brian Emerson 832-[xxxx] here is my letter to the editor. Please publish me. Oh yea i wish to join the view pts staff. Thanks XBJE@WZRD.COMX

      Looking through old files last night, I found this .txt. Does anyone know where this came from?   Sixteenth century French economist Pierre Huet found England and Holland similar in that they kept their empire building focused on commerce, and fighting three wars to secure that commercial aspect was in the interests of both nations. (ii) He observed firsthand that over time economics and the war machine grew intertwined during the colonial period. Comparing the state of the two European powers to comments by Gustavus Adolphus and Francis Bacon, who gauged the health of the state on economic opportunity and a sphere of influence, Huet despised the use of military strength to achieve financial aims but noted its effectiveness. (iii) For the period’s empire builders, economic stability maintained itself through a reiteration of might. Queen Elizabeth’s England was not a considerable naval or commercial force at the start, but the gradual increase of the twain played either factor as a host upon the other. Funding of early trips that led to Muscovy and around the African continent would not have been undertaken had not the voyages been touted as an investment, nor would the search for a Northwest or Northeast Passage happened if lacking the chance for individual wealth. In turn, competition by both the English and Dutch against the Spanish until their respective victories over that nation honed their mercantile skills until the two were “the Terror of the Ocean and the Narrow Seas.” (iv) In relation to this fact, my friend Joe has a Dutch chemistry professor. He is nothing like the typical pot smoking Dutch guy that Joe had hoped he would be. In fact, he is just the opposite: a boring old fuddy-duddy that gets erections when he hears the word “eigenfunction.” Ironically, the two British students in the class don’t really get along with the Dutch professor. The frequently call him a “wanker” and kick him in the testicles while screaming their loyalty to the Manchester United soccer club. Fortunately, Holland and England are both in Europe, which is far away from here.      PR1121.U62 Reel 256:E177 no.14  Reel 377:11 Coke, Roger. A Discourse of Trade. London: H. Brome, 1670.

(This was during the middle of a lesson.)  Kid: "Hey, Mr. S."  Me: "Hey."  Kid: "Do you know who I am?"  Me: " . . . "  Kid: "I'M RICK JAMES!"  And he limped back to his seat.

      Today I spent three hours cleaning the fridge. The fridge is older than me and probably hasn't been cleaned yet. I found materials that used to be organic. Then they weren't. Then they became organic again. What remains is half a jar of mustard, half a dozen eggs and some sticks of mustard. I learned a lot, mostly that there are plenty of colors not in the rainbow that still occur in nature.  pop-ups blocked by my google toolbar (downloaded in January): 998   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 3/30/04 1:55 am

      For the first time in months it's nice out and we can open the windows. Jerry came in my room this morning and said it smelled like bad breath. So I opened the windows and went to brush my teeth. I can't speak for the room, but my morning breath was horrible. Maybe he was right. Someone next door is cooking bacon. Seriously, I can really smell pork for some reason.   Flying Crocodile wins!

      FREDLINE NEWS was written a few days ago. It was sent to the "printers" and should be ready one of these days. In the meantime I might just start writing ahead. so for all of you FREDLINE NEWS fans--thanks, mom!--there's more on the way. The other day I went to the University of Buffalo for some research, and found a crappy newsletter called The Journal of Truth, or some crap like that. It was crap. I could make better crap than that, and in fact, I already do. Maybe I should print out FREDLINE NEWS and enlighten the inferior competition. We've already defeated Edline News, in what will prove to be our Poland. The Journal of Truth already looks like France. AHH Ha Ha Ha hA!

      My apartment is full of furniture, none of it bought. The couch came from a family who donated it to our church, but the church had no room for it. Same with the easy chair. Maybe we bought the folding table and the plastic porch chairs, but that's, what, twenty dollars? I have two lamps from who-knows-where. My filing cabinet was thrown away by someone in the Science Department. I use a nightstand that I built in a summer camp woodworking course. I stole a second filing cabinet from my parents. A small cabinet was found in a little-used closet. My father helped me grab a bookshelf/entertainment center from a neighbor's garbage one Christmas; it covers one full wall of my bedroom. In turn, I helped him rescue a large, metal teacher's desk from the scrap heap. Until recently I had a set of video shelves thrown together with some old wooden boards and empty shoe boxes. And how could I forget the green table besides me, a twenty-five-year-old reject from an ill-fated shop class? (I made the trim out of a roll of packaging tape. Someone threw away the tape as well.)

      One of the last great vestages of my undergraduate life, the non-perishable leftovers, passed away today. One of Jeff's containers of Pillsbury bread dough was ceremoniously dumped into the trash. Though still in good health, we realized that it had been stuck fast to the bottom of the fridge by an unknown organic substance. Rather than try to salvage the can and risk irreparable damage we let nature take its course. The dough is survived by several pots, and assortment of blue and yellow plastic plates, and a lone jar of Country Time Lemonade Mix (TM) ("Mix w/vodka and enjoy!").

      Ed and I are fighting, I think. It's over what to watch on television. This would almost seem normal if A) we were a couple, B) we were of opposite genders, and C) we lived in the same household. Instead, we live 1000 miles away. So here we sit typing away on Instant Messenger about what we're going to watch next so we can discuss it, and then we get into an argument about whether a certain show is funny or how we forced the other person to watch OUR show last week and should return the favor. We might need counseling. In other news, today I visited downtown Lancaster, New York for the first time today. In the words of Dr. Robert Butler, I had a firsthand experience of the quintessential articulation of mid-20th century Americana. Fascinating.

      For the past three months or so I've procrastinated over my master's thesis. Last night I spent a full two hours on it, which is probably the longest uninterrupted time period yet for me. This is sad. What's more sad than that? The guy who's supposed to read it hasn't written back about my proposal yet. That's pretty darn sad. Sadder still? How about writing paying $50 application fees to colleges that don't tell you if you're accepted? Handsome people like me can't get a break nowadays.

      After some consideration I've decided to change my computer's user name from "Ashley" to my own. It was funny at first, then quaint, then simply sad. At least I didn't name it something pretentious, like Porcshe, but I digress. Now, instead of a headshot of actress Ashley Judd, I get to start my computing day looking at the pic of an old, black Frederick Douglass and his big, white Fluffy 'Fro.

      Ed is NOT a Stephen Colbert fan. NOT! He is a casual viewer of Stephen Colbert that occasionally laughs at Colbert's jokes. I'm writing this down for all posterity, Ed! You see, anyone could watch Colbert's appearances on The Daily Show. Even the weakest of comedy afficionados could stay tuned for the occasional guest spot on Tough Crowd. But did Ed see Colbert on the American version of Whose Line Is It Anyway? Of course not! How many episodes of Strangers With Candy, Exit 57, or The Drew Carey Show did Ed ever tune in for? NOT A ONE. Did he buy Wigfield in hardcover--let alone at all--and read it cover-to-cover in the course of a weekend? BAH! And yet I have partaken in all these hilarious things. Ed would never remember Colbert's first Daily Show piece, where "The New Guy" gayly sashayed in front of the camera awkwardly, yet with enough of an idiot savant flair to immediately turn the most jaded comedy fan over to his creative grip. But I do. And as I sat watching another amazing episode of Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law tonight, with another amazing performance by one Stephen Colbert I tried counting the countless times I have pleaded with my friend Ed to watch the Adult Swim block in my little head. Redundantly speaking, it was impossible. Ed, you can keep your Patrice O'Neal. Stephen Colbert is with Me.

      The other day I went to Toronto with some friends but for what may be the first time ever, I did not drive. I wanted to sleep but couldn't. I was too worried about how the driving was going: navigating, not falling asleep, whether or not Joe used his signals when changing lanes. I was really anal retentive about everything. I also had a giant mound of my family's Canadian change that I was charged to get rid of. That challenge was also met head-on, turning about $30 of nickels and dimes into, well, it's all gone now. The reason I'm writing this is to acknowledge that I am too bloody uptight and need to relax a little. If you're reading this, you already know. Maybe I should smoke weed. Some guy came into work today and his eyes were comepletely bloodshot from weed; you could smell him from yards away. He was relaxed for sure...in fact, he just stood staring at the floor for several minutes at a time. He paid with exact change.

      Today we snuck across the border for an errand. Also accomplished the inevitable Canadian must-dos of eating poutine and spending about a litre of Canadian change that somehow smuggles its way south. You hear me, Canucks? We don't want your looney money! I'm half-Canadian, but based on the exchange rate I'm now half-American and 40% Canadian. I think the other 10% got moved to Mexico. Muy problemo!  CD purchases $5 Canadian each!  Handsome Boy Modeling School, "So...How' Your Girl?" John Coltrane, "The Gentle Side of John Coltrane" Sonic Youth, "Goo" Primus, "Pork Soda"  Great albums all!

      CD: Liam Lynch, "Fake Songs"  Today at work I had to replace the Ketchup Dispenser. The ketchup (or catsup) comes in plastic bags that hold about three gallons apiece. Well, one of the bags ripped. Ketchup started flowing like a newly discovered oil well. The K.D. wouldn't take the bag, and I couldn't just throw away three gallons of ketchup, so I found a large bucket and drained it all into that. Now the big problem: how to put all this ketchup from a bucket into small ketchup bottles. A funnel? The bucket was too big to pour into a small funnel, so I got a second, smaller bucket to dip into the first, then dumped that into the funnel. That's when I realized that ketchup doesn't pour, it plops. Stuff that plops can't go through a funnel, it only clogs the funnel. That's when I grabbed a spoon to put pressure on the top of the clog to get it to go down into the bottle. It took forever. Then someone suggested finding a plastic bag, putting a whole lot of ketchup into it, then cutting a small hole in the bottom corner of the bag to let a high pressure stream of ketchup fall out of the hole. A good idea indeed. The high pressure stream, however, is difficult to control. By the end of the debacle, I had a broken Ketchup Dispenser, two ketchup-drenched kitchen tables, a cowpie of ketchup on the floor, giant ketchup stains on my shirt, pants and shoes, ten bottles of ketchup overflowing on all sides, a large stirring spoon covered in ketchup all up the handle, a small pitcher coated in ketchup on the inside and out, a second giant, practically useless Bucket O'Ketchup, and a garbage can filled with ketchup-catching napkins that made it look like the World's Most Destructive Period. Thus endeth The Ketchup Story.

      Today someone at the store demanded to know whether a certain baseball cap was for men or for women. I never knew they made different caps for men or women. That's because they don't. The guy wasn't convinced with my answer, and demanded a guarantee that he could return it if it ended up being for the wrong sex. A possible scenario:  Guy 1: I hope you like it. Guy 2: A baseball cap! Thanks!   Guy 2: It doesn't fit! This must be a WOMAN'S baseball cap! Guy 1: I'm sooooo embarrassed!  Also at the store, we sell unisex cigarettes, gum, newspapers, and 20 oz. bottles of Coke.

      I went to Perkins with The Folks. I bought them dinner. Then I went to Joe's and wrote a song about people with three names. If you know anyone with three names that's famous, please tell us what they are. We're brainstorming and need a good list. Some examples:  James Earl Jones Mary Kate Olsen Billy Ray Cyrus  Like all our other songs, they will Rock. Trust me.   Tonight I became a perfectionist in the studio. Joe can't keep time and it's hurting the band. He's got to tighten up his solos or he's out on his @$$.

      Tonight I went to my court-ordered driving class. There was a real old lady in the front named Delores who wouldn't stop making innocent comments, stupid or otherwise. I counted 21 dumb comments to 5 useful ones. Two of the useful ones pointed out grammar errors in the book.  Teacher: "Delores, what answer did you get for number 4?"  Delores: "False?"  Teacher: "That's correct."  Delores: "Oh. So it's true?"  Teacher: "No, you're right."  Delores: "Why isn't it False? I put down False."  Teacher: "The answer IS False. Maybe I misspoke. I'm sorry."  Delores: "Alrighty. So it's False then?"  Teacher: "YES."  Delores [talking to herself too loudly]: "So that's number . . . 4."  [class rolls eyes]

      CD: The Shins, "Chutes Too Narrow"  While spring cleaning--okay, leap year cleaning--I found a crate of long-lost stuff underneath some stairs. This included my copy of "Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing", my report cart from fifth grade, the school yearbook from first grade, two copies of the official Map of Newstead (not much to see), the entire Bible on cassette, several sets of school photos from my "It's picture day again? I forgot to dress up" era, and soon to be the most disturbing of all, some mix tapes my parents made for each other when they were dating.  From now on I will also use my weblog to document the new CDs/DVDs I either buy or magically acquire. Tonight Dave forcefully dragged me to Best Buy and DEMANDED that I buy: The Shins, "Chutes Too Narrow" CD Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVD Volume 1 D. W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" DVD  "I don't need no instructions to know how to ROCK!" -Carl

      Last night I went to a lecture by a guy who had some pretty pointed views about modern Jewish historiography. The hall was packed and their were a lot of tensions in the audience. After going to a number of lectures this year--What else should I be doing, actual work?--I've categorized several types of persons that go to these events:  1) People who want to listen with an open mind. I'd like to think I'm one of those, especially since I had no idea who this guy was before the lecture.  2) People who agree with a guy so much they'd marry him if they could. They laugh at the guy's jokes a little to hard, usually followed by applause. These people come to see their murky beliefs solidified by a person that concurs with them but can also write a book about it.  3) People who disagree with a guy enough that they'd beat him in a back alley somewhere, and are sick enough that they'd listen to him rant just to make themselves angrier. These people are a rare breed; there might be a handful in the audience, but they leave early. They mutter stuff when they leave. Since last night's lecture was about the Middle East, the muttering was in foreign languages. They must be really bored.  4) People who disagree with a guy enough that they want him dead. These people are like #3 but they show up more often, armed with fliers, placards, poorly functioning medullas, pre-written lists of errors in scholarship, demanding voices and no manners. During Q&As they are often found confusing the word "lecture" with "debate" and the word "question" with "rambling statement of contradictory personal beliefs". Last night these people required a police presence and threats of physical removal. Though noticable, these people are generally rare. Bill O'Reilly is one of these people: his species only exists in wildlife refuges but he's still the World-Famous Great Bucking Donkey.  5) Hippies and retired people. Soon we can call them "retired hippies." They go to anything. These people are also known as "distinguished faculty".  In order of population, it usually goes #2, #5, #4, #1, #3.

      For my birthday I got something called the Presto Pizzazz (R) which promises "Freezer to perfect [pizza] in minutes. While ordinary ovens are heating, you're eating." Instead of being a regular oven, it's more like a hot plate that looks like a cross between the front of the Starship Enterprise and a Mr. Fusion machine from Back To The Future. Apparently it will shave 10-15 minutes off of my waiting-for-pizza-to-cook time, which I usually spent folding laundry, reading mail, or doing something else constructive (e.g. using the bathroom). Now I'll be saving so much time nothing will get done.

You ever see those ads on the TV that say you can get a catalog of free information from the government, and all you have to do is write to Pueblo, Colorado? Well guess what I did. Not only that, they gave me 15 copies of everything. The box weighed about twelve pounds. If you ever desire a booklet on how to invest wisely, what medicines not to mix, or how you will be affected by the onset of menopause, I'm the man you want to see.

      April 19 is important for many reasons. The Battle of Lexington & Concord was on April 19, 1775 in what is now known as "Patriots Day" in Massachusetts. On April 19, 1993, the US Government attacked the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, leaving scores of men, women and children dead. Timothy McVeigh, who would later show up in Waco to protest the act, planned and executed the Oklahoma City Bombing of April 19, 1997 in retaliation. He often quoted Founding Father Thomas Jefferson in defense of his actions, saying "The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of tyrants and patriots." As in 1775, on April 19, 1943 an unknown gunshot in Warsaw, Poland began a forty-two day rebellion of the city's Jews against Nazi attempts to transfer them to extermination camps.  So there you go. Tomorrow's just as bloody: Hitler's birthday AND the Columbine Massacre. Enjoy your week!

      After spending the afternoon listening to Foreigner's Greatest Hits, I've decided that what may be "greatest hits" for one band may simply be "songs" to most other bands. I have a policy of listening to all my records all the way through, and I must say it was a very long hour. If you've ever been in a class for a subject you have no interest in, you'll understand. "Double Vision" was okay, and though the song wasn't so good, it was fun hearing the guy say "'cuz I'm a Dirty White Boy!" I filed this CD under "F." For "Foreigner."

      Music News:  Posted on Sat, Apr. 10, 2004  Elderly parents of `Weird Al' Yankovic found dead in home Associated Press  FALLBROOK, Calif. - The elderly parents of Grammy-winning recording artist "Weird Al" Yankovic were found dead in their home, apparently victims of carbon monoxide poisoning, officials said.  Nick Yankovic, 86, and his wife, Mary Yankovic, 81, were found dead about 1 p.m. Friday in their suburban San Diego home by three family members, said sheriff's Sgt. Conrad Grayson, a fire investigator.  The relatives came to the house because they had not seen the couple in a while and were concerned.  Paramedics found Nick Yankovic in a chair in the front living room. His wife was lying on the bathroom floor.  A fire had been recently set in a fireplace in the house, Grayson said.  "The house was full of smoke when they opened the door," Grayson said. "We examined the fireplace. They were burning wood. They (family) had found the flue closed. They opened it."  "Weird Al" Yankovic, 44, had been scheduled to appear Wednesday night in Kansas at the Topeka Performing Arts Center as part of a tour for his new album. Attempts to reach him by telephone through his agency, the William Morris Agency, were unsuccessful Saturday.  Yankovic's parents were described by a neighbor as nice people who were proud of their son's accomplishments.  "Everybody who came to the neighborhood knew Nick," said John Buehman, who lives across the street. "They're going to be missed, big time."

Fred Finds CD Wallet In Burger King Parking Lot 10 April 2004 FREDLINE NEWS  (Clarence, New York) FN - Fred found someone's CD wallet in the parking lot of a Burger King today. The wallet was one of those ones that attach to the sun visor in your car so you can change CDs when you drive, sources say.  Though Fred asked those around the parking lot if they had lost the particular item, no persons came forward. Though there were ten CDs inside the wallet at the time, they were all classical.   "Even though the music is somewhat bland, I will still take full advantage of the free CDs and of the usefulness of the wallet," spoke Fred in a press release statement this afternoon. The press release did not say what Fred was doing at a Burger King.

      I had a cup of milk next to me at dinner last night and what does the cat do but start drinking from it when I wasn't looking. In response I start knocking on the cat's head with my fist. I was rapping on his skull pretty hard with my knuckles but the cat, even why his head rattled, didn't hesitate to continue drinking the milk. I don't know how he did it. Eventually I had to just pull the cup away from him. So then you may ask, did I then drink from that same cup, from that same milk? The answer is yes. I already admitted to beating my cat...

      Last week a few of us went to Quebec. All three of us had several years of education concerning the French language, and it was all useless. We Sucked. I couldn't even order a sandwich right ("The Number Four", sadly). During the ride we tried speaking in French, mostly mocking the Quebecois, but when we arrived we were des stupides. Je regrete, les Quebecois, mon mal. Then we stopped at the Burger King Motel, which is a real Burger King with a real Motel. We wondered if it had room service, which would have been awesome. Instead of mints, they could have left little ketchup packets on our pillows! Or as the Canadians would say, catsup packets.

      Two important events on Friday that changed Dave for the better:   1) The purchase of a cowbell. The man's got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell.  2) I owe Dave eight dollars, instead of the other way around.

      So we were out to eat last night and one of us was talking about how they would rather have an Intelligent Conversation with a woman than go to a topless bar. To which I put a dollar bill in my mouth and yelled "Tell me about Nietzsche!" They laughed so hard I had to tell it twice. G'night, folks, try the veal.

      The people of the Rochester area are some of the nicest folks you could ever meet. In the town of Sweden I found kids and adults of all races playing and working together in harmony, black-and-white cookie style. Local historians are active community leaders who write poems about things like dogs and hamburger stands. The centerpiece of the town is a homemade September 11th statue. People ask you if you need directions and want to know how you're doing if you don't look familiar. At the local college, a student who couldn't get my library card to work went out of her way to find loopholes in the system, and then finally checked my books out under her own name so I could take them home. That's classy!

      Yesterday was my first experience in a Duty Free Shop. There was a lot of alcohol which didn't interest me because I don't drink, and a lot of perfume, which is an even lesser topic of conversation. If someone smells nice, and you tell them, they're never going to say "Do you like it? I got it by the gallon at the Duty Free Shop." The complete opposite of the commercials, perfume buying must be very unromantic. What did interest me was the size of the chocolate bars. Five pounds of Kit Kats for six dollars is awesome. They had those big Toblerones you can only get in airport stores, but here they came in packs of three for $24. You could munch on that for a month, which is just about the time it takes for me to get back to the Duty Free Shop. Maybe I'll invest in a gold-bar-sized hunk of the Swiss Stuff next time I'm around.

      Two days ago my sister got fired from her job. I had to drive her to work that day, and she called to have me pick her up before I got home. I tried to be reassuring and stuff, but then she said something like "it's your fault" or a similar stupid comment. That's when I piled in her. Of course they fired you; you can't hold a job. You probably didn't work hard enough. Hey, maybe you can get a new job cleaning houses, so other people's places will be just as sparklingly unclean as ours. She was unfazed. Just another Thursday at the house.

      Leadership Conference, pt. 3  Bag lunches, provided by Anderson's, were . . . provided. For lunch. You could get the famous Beef on Weck sandwich, or turkey or ham, with chips, a cookie, and all the Pespi you could drink (one of the speakers was CEO of PespiCo). But I know all about being a leader from the most important leader in America, George F'N W Bush. Here's how crazy King George the Third helped me take advantage of the situation:  1.) Don't pay attention at important meetings. I brought stuff to read. By the end of the day I had finished a 200-page book, 2 newspapers and several short stories. I needed a backpack for everything, but that just shows preparedness.  2.) As a leader, rules of equity don't apply to you. This one was easy. Walking through the food line, I grabbed a Turkey bag. Then, I went to get my complimentary Pepsi. Then, I put it in my backpack. Then, I went back in line. With free hands I grabbed me a Roast Beef.   3.) Why buy something if you can pre-emptively take it? I got free pens, a half-dozen free sodas and a SWEET Post-It pad that's about 4 inches thick. I'll be writing on free Post-Its until 2012.  4.) Don't learn anything; someone will lead for you. I don't remember a thing. The end!

      Leadership Seminar pt. 2:  Seminar Speakers are normally forgetable. The first one during the conference, however, at least got my attention with his topic. Two giant screens in the 1500-person room said simply: "MEET FRED." I now quote from the program handed out to all the participants.  GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER FRED  Who is Fred? And how does he manage to make a difference in the lives of everyone he meets?  --Fred is the customer service rep on the phone who finally gives you some service.  --Fred is the clerk who loans you $5.00 because the ATM is broken.  --Fred is the postman whose outstanding service inspired Mark Sanborn's THE FRED FACTOR.  Fred is the extraordinary person we can all be if we just follow the four life-changing principles that can help us find fresh energy, enthusiasm, and creativity wherever our careers or lives may lead.  Stop making it through the day. Start making a difference.  www.fredfactor.com

      Last Friday I went to a Leadership Seminar for business-type people who have to go to leadership seminars. Here's a conversation I overheard while in the bathroom between speakers:  1: "Hey, whaddya think so far?"  2: "Oh man, are you kidding? I live for this stuff!"  1: "Ha ha! I hear ya. That guy was right on about prioritizing.   2: "You know it. You know, every morning I enter my tasks in my tablet..."  [this is where I started rolling my eyes]  2: "...and then I put them in order of importance. And I've found that when I accomplish the first three or four, the rest just seem to melt away."  1: "So true. Are you staying for the lunch roundtable session? I'm going to be here the whole day."  2: "You know it!"  I didn't know these people existed. More on this later.

Perhaps you know of my previous Yahoo! addictions, such as Launchcast Radio (reached "fanatic" in three days; temporarily banned for overuse), Geocities website space (I have two sites), and Yahoo! Photos (about 1200 photos uploaded within the first forty-eight hours). Now I play a game or two against whatever goof is online. Many times it's grandmothers that completely destroy me.  ADDENDUM:  After just playing, I must admit I totally rocked it. The score was like 300 to 170. I used up all my letters 3 times. THREE times, people. THREE.

      More reading of  The Little Red Schoolhouse  ensued.  It seems that only a rotating cast of supporters and journalists put the thing together, with diminishing returns.  Begun in 1927, the eight-page monthly eventually became a four-page monthly, then an eight-page bimonthly, and then quit in 1935.  Though many periodicals shut down with the onset of the depression, the fact that several of the dozen or so persons running the paper died was also cause for concern.  This fact could also symbolize the cause of one-room schoolhouses: aged, passing away slowly without replacement.  The first issue emphasized rural Brockport's struggle for district autonomy, but by 1935 the fight was futile.  Lost lawsuits led to closed classrooms.  Public opposition quieted.  The paper was pretty low-rate.  It required donations to stay afloat, and begged that rural schools put those donations into their budgets.  Simultaneously, they argued against the higher taxes that would arise as a result of consolidation and the salaries of school boards.  Articles were inflammatory and propagandistic.  School superintendents were Tsarist dictators, the State Department of Education was despotic, and the state judicial system supported tyranny and despised dictators.  When elections and referendums were held, they were fraudulent.  Town officials performed a litany of conduct errors at each public meeting.  And in each case, a Rural School Improvement Society member witnessed each offense for  Schoolhouse  readers, promising speedy legal repercussions.

      Skip this if you want.  I'm working on my thesis and want to prove that I've accomplished something.  Somehow posting it is more enjoyable than finishing more.  Right now I'm looking through  The Little Red Schoolhouse  , a newsletter from 1929.  The thesis may simply complain about the asinine diction and grammar skills of these enlightened rural school advocates.  Here's a sample paragraph.  If you can explain to me how they've proved whatever point they're making, I'll give you a gold star:  "According to our information, the whole legal force of the State Department of Education, in co-operation with the legal talent of the State Attorney-General's office and numerous other legal lights in the city of Rochester are apparently engaged in a determined effort to bind these districts tighter to Brockport village and thus not lose the big assessed valuation of about $4,000,000 which the poor village of Brockport needs to help it build its Central Rural High School, since the village has, with the other districts which comprise the Union School district, only the meager amount of $4,000,000 for its own assessed valuation."  Does Brockport have a "big" assessed evaluation or a "meager" one?  Is Brockport "poor," or overbearing and influential, as the paper described in an issue just one year before?  And here's a pile of info I typed up, almost as bad (456 words)  Comment if you feel like it.   The Normal Schools act of 16 April 1866 created four Normal Schools.  One proposed school would be at Brockport, with a pricetag of forty to fifty thousand dollars.  The pre-existing Baptist College, however, was later determined to be in a poorer condition than Brockport described it.  The state shelved the new school and gave the property to Brockport to pay off local debts.  Dedman describes the events leading to the Normal School's creation as the "Normal School War."  At the center of the argument, as with most local issues, was the threat of higher taxes.  The village held a referrendum for taxpayers only and school supporters lost, 139-102.  The Village Board also examined the amount of property owned by the voters, and found that schools supporters own a majority of taxable land: $185,800 to only $106,460.  Clearly difference of opinion could be designated by class.  The village board, based on this information, re-voted on 10 May 1866 to supercede the referrendum and petition the Normal School Commissioners again for the school, and limited funds raised through taxable income to $37,000.  The majority of voters righteously felt cheated.  Consistent commotion demanded yet another public vote on 1 August.  This time both male and female taxpayers could vote, though the women by proxy, and the school clearly won 165-131.  Once Brockport began to support a Normal School on their land, they noticed they had competition.  Nearby Clinton County, the village of Cortland, Fredonia, St. Lawrence Academy, the Antwerp Insitute, Central Academy in Megrowville, the Delaware Academy, the Newark College Institute, Fort Edward Institute, and the Seminary at Charlotteville in Schoharie County are all recorded as proposing land, buildings, and other facilities to win a new Normal School.  Brockport proposed $100,000 for land and the former Baptist Institute as well as $3000 more for furnishings, and won one of the four new schools (Binghamton, Potsdam, and Fredonia were the other three).     It should be noted that a number of inhabitants, some prominent, refused to pay the new taxes in the next year. E.P. Root complains to Board, saying that raising the property values around the new school has benefitted those elected: "The chief question involved in the matter has been made one of pecuniary interest.  You obtain the schol independent of the town, not asking us to participated in your action.  You did it as a matter of business.  Sume thought it would give increased salaries, others increased rent, still others increased trade.  The motive was gain.  You thus assumed the responsibility of agreeing to erect these buildings.  Now you call upon us to assist you, and have secretly secured the passage of a special act which gives you the legal power to levy this tax on the town."

       urlLink Sony Connect   I tried using those free download things they put on Big Mac containers.  They work fine, but who wants to download something that won't convert to a basic format like .mp3 or .wav?  I understand the importance of protecting copyrighted material, but it seriously compromises the value of the material.  In the time spent searching for decent songs to buy--rare tracks, the ones I'd think to be beneficial for both parties--I could have downloaded ten times the material for free as a standard audio file.  They've got a while to go before digital music is universally playable, and therefore economically viable.

      Seriously, we have to go to Metric.  It's so much simpler.  But anyway this post is about  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I had to drive for an hour to get to the theater because only three places in the area were showing the film and the other two were sold out for the weekend (!)  So after about two hours of IMs and phone calls and traffic, I made it to Orchard Park.  There were several interesting notes not involving the film, which include:  --Meeting STEEVIE STEVE for the first time --The jackarse who wouldn't shut up the entire movie (was he the same guy at The Passion?) --The lines to get in (sold out like all the other showings) --The cop stationed next to the ticket-taker --Going to Louie's Red Hots after the show  At Louie's, STEEVIE STEVE got feta cheese for his hot dog.  It was a lot of cheese.  Meanwhile, I concocted that the movie  Super Size Me  accurately shows how John Kerry wants to make us fat.  Burgers at McDonald's most often have ketchup on them, and Heinz is the largest producer of ketchup.  John Kerry is married to an heir of the Heinz family fortune.  Don't you see?  Kerry is an opponent of Bush because Bush is from Texas, the center of the burgeoning salsa industry.  The salsa market is growing phenomenally and directly threatening the Heinz/Kerry family fortune!  There were connections in  Fahrenheit 9/11  that almost seemed that far-fetched, however, it never went that far out.  I would say that not everything in the film was true, but nothing was false.  It was the funniest film I've seen this year, but didn't show me anything I couldn't have gotten from The Daily Show except for a little extra research.  As our buddy Dave said, the movie was propaganda.  Great propaganda.  It didn't have to rely on lies like Goebbels did but simply the humanness of its subjects.  George W. Bush is a moron and I could have told you that in 2000.  Still, there's nothing like seeing him and his administration in all its "nucular" glory.

      A lovely time of togetherness and group fortification was held at the Putt-Putt on Sheridan tonight.  We were going to see some band downtown but Dave said it was wack and we met a Joe's.  Sarah refused to drink the lemonade and received the cat o'nine tails for her mistake.  In defense she hit Joe with a golf club, creating a serious bump on his forehead.  During a highly competitive game of golf in which I vanquished all who opposed me, The Almighty and Merciful Lord rained down flood waters upon us to prevent a total washout on the scoresheet.  Then enlighted by the heavens to show compassion upon my competitors, I treated everyone to beverages and vittles at a local pub, completely on me.  Salsa was involved.  So was Mango.  Dave, speaking for the rest of the group, thanked me from the bottom of his heart for the times of their lives.  So endith the evening.  And remember, if you reneg on something, you're a renegger.  I'm Audi 5000.

       urlLink AOL Employee Charged With Stealing Names (TechNews.com)   I've tried to convince my family that AOL is evil and far too expensive.  Several times that company has signed my father up for broadband service even though he's never asked, and though we already have a cable internet provider, he still pays the $23 a month for the telephone connection.  According to him, he remains a loyal customer because he is familiar with the service.  I try to tell him that he could get similar functions for free (E-mail, instant messaging), but several hundred dollars a year isn't enough of an incentive.  Of course he complains about spam, pop-ups, and slow connections.  What is two plus two?  Couldn't tell ya.

      Sometime in early 2002 Ashley Judd appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  She was articulate, funny, and overall just gosh darned sweet.  As my alleged friends would have it, we fell in love.  One friend even suggested I visit him in Nashville and let him drive me by her house.  Or her relatives' house.  Either way, Ashley Judd is not my Jodie Foster, but when I eventually  did  visit my friend in Nashville he seemed visibly disappointed that I preferred seeing the Country Music Hall of Fame over the Stalker's Tour of Franklin.  Folks, what I'm trying to say is that the joke's gone too far and gotten too old.  There were times that I have helped drag it along--using her photo as an avatar at  urlLink Dissek.com , for example--but some jokes just don't stay funny for two years.  Hereby declared tonight, after viewing a second appearance of Mrs. Judd on the aforementioned show, that the fictitious coupling of myself to a movie star I have never met has ceased to not exist.  Let's just stick to Tina Fey for the time being.  CD: Beastie Boys, "To The 5 Boroughs"

      I did a quick late-night search for "Schrag," which is the original form of "Schrock."  I found  urlLink this website  which has some early family info, and also the results of a Roald Schrock's DNA test, which I will quote in part (there's a lot of chemistry stuff in between):  "A large number of the families with the Schrock, Schrack, or Schrag surnames who currently live in the United States, have their origins in the mountain highlands of the Swiss canton of Bern, among early members of the Mennonite and Amish faiths, whose name was originally spelled as Schrag.  These Amish or Mennonite Schrag families all seem to have had their origins in the town of Wynigen, Switzerland, and specifically, in the hamlets of Loumberg and Mistelberg.  These ancestors left their homes because of persecution, which the combined forces of the established churches and the state unleashed against all non-conformist movements.  Many lived for some time in the Jura Mountains, in Alsace, and in parts of Germany, before emigrating to America, where they started to spell the family name as Schrock, Shrock, or Schrack.  Others migrated to the East, reaching Russia, where they lived for some time, before also coming to America, where they retained the original Schrag spelling.  My family's branch is descended from "Uli" (Ulrich) Schrag, who came to America in 1769, as part of the first wave of Amish immigration, settling in Somerset County, in the mountains of western Pennsylvania. His Schrock descendents were early settlers of LaGrange County, Indiana, where my paternal grandparents (no longer Amish) grew up. (More details to come!)  "My father, Roald A. Schrack, has been the pioneer, the first male of a Schrock/Schrack/Schrag lineage to come forward and have his Y chromosome DNA tested, so that we can gain a more in-depth picture of our history. We used the  testing company, Family Tree DNA.  The results of his test are exciting and unexpected. They show a genetic pattern that's found mainly in people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origins.  Of course, we are talking about origins, most likely, many thousands of years ago! But still -- how would that be possible?  Most of the ancestors of people who have this genetic type in Northern Europe, are thought to have migrated North after the end of the Ice Age, bringing agriculture during Neolithic times, from its beginnings in the Fertile Crescent, into the Mediterranean basin, and from there to the rest of Europe.  They would have been the first teachers of farming and animal husbandry to the hunting and gathering peoples.  Haplotypes similar to my father's seems to be especially common in Northern Italy.  So there are a few other possibilities specific to that region. One is that people of the early Etruscan civilization or of the great Roman Empire traveled northward across the Alps in their trading, political, or military activities.  Another possibility which fascinates me has to do with the many "heretical" movements that arose during the Middle Ages, such as the Albigensians (Cathars) and the Waldensians, who were violently persecuted.  These movements were centered in Southern France, and also grew very strong among the neighboring people of Northern Italy, especially Lombardy, and some of their members are known to have fled from the persecution by heading north over the Alps.  Amish and Mennonite historical sources such as the famous Martyrs Mirror trace the roots of their movement to that of the Waldensians.  "Will all the Schrock, Schrack and Schrag men turn out to share this same genetic type? Did our Schrag ancestors leave an ancient Mediterreanean homeland to settle the Alpine valleys? How will our DNA type compare with other Amish and Mennonite families, and other Swiss?  "Roald Schrack also seemed to nearly match with the Y-DNA of a fellow named Metni, from Lebanon, who is also in the Family Tree DNA database."

      I'm extremely pissed today, and for all the right reasons.  Let's go back to my workplace, about a year ago, and I can explain myself.  Last summer a position opened where I work.  Instead of the variable hours everyone usually gets, this one remained in the morning.  It possibly pays better too, but the more important thing is that I wanted the position, it would have made me more money because I would have been more available, and I was more than qualified to do it.  Signs were posted, noting that the job had to be filled immediately and to talk to a manager.    I also had a friend at the time who did not work for the company, but was known by the management (let's call them A and B) and expressed interest shortly before I did (let's call this person C).  C had to go out of town.  Then, six months passed.  In C's absence, C requested I check up on the job for them.  Talking to A and B, I made clear C's intention to come back and take the position, even though they kept delaying their return.  Since the job had to be filled immediately, I also told them I would take the job until C returned.  In those six months, the position was never filled.  C took the job, with no prior experience or training, upon their return.  Fast forward another six months, to today.  C is leaving, for good, and I am still working for the company as I have for the past five years.  D, who has far less experience, training, and education, is now being trained by A, B, and C for the job.  There was no job posting.  I'm angry because after five years doing night shifts I'm being shafted by both management and co-worker who might have never gotten their job without my help.  They have failed to take me into consideration not once, but twice, and maybe on purpose.  Today I seriously thought about quitting on the spot.  Then I did some calculations, seeing how I already scheduled a vacation for next month (including buying plane tickets).  It would be impossible for me to get another job until the fall, and quitting immediately would give me a loss of $1300 in wages after taxes.  That's not much, but it's $1300 more than $0.  If I was assured a stationary, full-time schedule (which in my current position is rare) that number would double.  Regrettably, in order to not cause any more problems for both myself and other coworkers in the next three months I should probably not even bring this up.  I'm just going to quit after Labor Day and not waste another five years in the same stagnant swamp, despite the convenience.

      I didn't think I could do it, but I skipped an entire day of thesis work to transfer the last 250 weblogs to Blogspot.  Get ready for the same old blogs, but with pictures.  But one last time with the 4th grade papers.  Maybe, if you're nice, you can see more in the future.  Fourth grade was not very fun.  I didn't like the teachers and creative writing was a chore.  Note how I really pad out the story, also, the future irony of my sports prediction.   Jan. 26, 1990  Motor Bowl  The year is 2223 football, baseball, and basketball have stopped being America's favorite pastimes.  The new craze: motor ball.  The game is played almost like football.  It is played with 10 people on each team, all riding motorcycles.  The object of the game: to an old football in your motorcycle across an old football field to the end zone.  (This game is very dangerous)...  Hello, motorsports fans, Im Derf Kcorhcs This is the 4th annual Motor Bowl.  The teams: Buffalo Brakes against the San Francisco 49 horsepower.  Buffalo's fixing their Yamahas, While San Francisco check out their Harleys.  And the game is about to begin.  1st quarter.  The 49'ers got a little bit too tense.  Their quarterback just about GAVE the ball to Buffalo.  It was the Break's ball anyway.  2nd quarter.  Buffalo made one, but missed the extra point.  The 49'ers lost their quarterback due to a motorcycle injury.  Now they're mad...  3rd quarter.  San Francisco made two touchdowns.  (for the other team)  Score: Buffalo 26, San Francisco 0.  4th quarter.  The 49'ers make two touchdowns, two extra points.  Now they make another touchdown, but missed the extra point.  26 to 26.  10 seconds left.  9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Wait!  The Breaks made a touchdown they win.  By the way, Buffalo has won all 4 Motor Bowls.

      --"grade" on following paper  Today officially marks two years since I began writing weblogs.  I guess this is an opportune time to upgrade to an actual posting program instead of a message board-based system.  But since it takes bloody near forever to move 400 posts, here again is some creative writing from fourth grade.  Considering the dominance of the 9/11 Commission in the news, this story should teach us all a deep moral lesson. :)   Oct. 5, 1989  Help!  It was just an ordinary day in the red ant colony.  It was afternoon, and everybody was coming home from work.  John, which is one of those ants, went outside for a little walk.  As he was going to come back in he spotted a black ant spy!  He ran into the anthill, screaming and shouting as he went.  The queen has been having a meeting for three hours now.  John had no time to lose.   He ran into a guard at the door of the queen's chamber.  The ant was named Big Ant Strong.  Strong wouldn't believe anything from a small fry like John.  "Hey, Strong, your shirt's inside out!" John said as he rammed himself through the door.  John spotted the secretary of the queen.  "Where's (huff) Where's the (puff) the (huff) Where is (puff) Where's the queen?" He asked, catching his breath.  The secretary pointed to a sign.  It read:  NO CIVILIANS (OR WHATEVER) ALLOWED OR EXECUTION!  By then the black ants had come in and captured the whole colony.  The queen was to blame.

      From now on my weblog posts will be here at Blogspot.  Coincidentally, today I was cleaning out the garage (which will take weeks).  I found a writing portfolio from fourth grade which I will post from for the next few days, until I get all these entries moved.  Today's is a fitting introduction to the enigma that is my bad, rebellious self.  FYI, the title of this post is the "grade" I got written on my paper.  Get used to those asinine teacher comments, folks . . . .    Nov. 28, 1989  Me.       I don't have much to say about myself, because there's nothing exciting going on in my life.  I have a few hobbies, which are: comic strips, Nintendo, TV, baseball cards, pennies, maps, puzzles, reading, drawing, eating, and others.       At home it's pretty boring too.  Everything I own is usually broken or lost.  My mom borrows money from me and never pays back.  No one has fallen down the stairs for six months.  My whole family plays the piano but they also hate it.  Every room is a mess.  Legos are scattered all over the floor.  The most exciting thing that happens at home is my brother and sister fighting.  (Or Batman and The Joker fighting).       As I said, my life is pretty boring.

      We have rats. Well, one rat. I think I saw it, around the kitchen. I found out that rat traps cost $1.61, which I think is a pretty good deal. You can also get two mouse traps for a dollar. Anyway, I hate rats. One time I went down in the basement to "help" my dad fix a water heater, and what did I almost step on but a dead rat the size of an adult cat. With the tail it could have been 18 inches long. Then my father asked me to get rid of it, but I could barely step over its corpse to run back upstairs. So in some respects I hope we don't catch the rat, because the last thing I want to see waking up in the morning is a dead rat on my kitchen floor. And remember, when using manual rat traps the worst thing isn't finding a dead rat, it's finding half a dead rat.

      Oh man, I had so many things I was going to write about but I forgot them all. If only I had a Blogspot (TM) weblog with the integrated Google Toolbar (also TM) blogging feature! Oh woe is me! With the time I spend picking my nose I could convert all my old posts, so why don't I? How could I be such a fool to post on this antiquated message board? I'm so ashamed! Jeff, save me from the error of my ways!  In other news, Megan Smith would make a great antihero in the movie of my life. Launchcast, online Scrabble, OddTodd.com . . . she has introduced all of these to me and all of them have thrown weeks of my life into the circular file. I must now go Brockport and do that research stuff I procrastinated for a month on, and quickly, before she signs on again.  After a month or so of having a poor battery in my laptop (40 minutes tops) this new one feels like running around naked in a shopping mall: free and exciting. These three paragraphs are all about the Internet, so you can tell how my life is really going this week. Out.

      I just saw the video for Jimmy James for the Beastie Boys. I think there's a different video for that song on the DVD anthology I bought for $27. There's plenty of cool stuff on the DVDs, but there are no License To Ill videos, OR "She's On It," or Jimmy James. I feel like the anthology wasn't very anthologetic. Lately I've been reading weblogs by friends of mine, and they talk about politics or jobs or philosophy. Well here's a little info for you:  MY BLOG : MISCELLANIOUS CONTENT :: FOX NEWS : CONSERVATIVE REPORTING  also,  MY BLOG : MISCELLANIOUS CONTENT :: YOUR BLOG : SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT  :.  YOUR BLOG = FOX NEWS  I think that's the Law of Detachment. Dare question me, Mr. Logical? Mr. Bill O'Reilly? That's right. Dirrty Souf!

      Clothes shopping is a big deal for me, because I do it once every other year or so. Right now, in fact, I am wearing a pair of shorts and a tee shirt I got when in the 5th grade. So you can see my use for a new wardrobe. I tried to switch things up a little. For one--and this is bigger than you might think--ankle socks. After a lifetime of only rocking the tubes, I decided to get a little crazy. For another, instead of earthtones I bought some bright stuff. I have an orange shirt now. Orange! Thirdly, it was important that I bought really loose pants. Normally I buy pants from the 30-32 range, where I fluxuate. On some days certain things fit while others don't. Last year, however, I bought a belt (!), so now I can go a little bigger just in case. These 34s are tres comfortable. Not to mention they ride a little lower! Are you listening, ladies? And these socks are gonna show off some more leg, too!

      As I drove to work today I lamented the fact that I couldn't go to the Akron Sidewalk Sale for yet another year. The Sidewalk Sale is a big Akron event and during the two times I've been able to go, I quite enjoyed it. It's a much smaller-scale Allentown Art Festival (which I also missed). Sadder still was just how nice it was outside today. I kept telling myself how I shouldn't work on Saturdays.  Then I found out I don't. They changed my schedule so for the first time in years, I won't have anything to do on Saturday. I can go to the bloody park, meet some freakin' friends, work on my stinkin' thesis, or do whatever else the heck I want. So what do I do? I go to work and stay there for the extra money. It was actually quite pleasant. Did I just say that? Fudge, I did.

      One of our new channels is the RFD Network, or Rural Free Delivery. It's the farmer's channel, basically. It's also pretty darn good. They cover tractor shows, have agricultural news from the University of Tennessee, and right now they're playing a polka party. Cornbread: ain't nuthin' wrong with that.

      Lately I've been questioned about my political opinions and ideologies. Republicans think I'm a Democrat, and vice versa (or they think I'm a Republican, Ed). How narrow-minded! Political parties are simply trusts, oligopolizing government planning. Whatever happened to people like George Washington? He didn't put up with this kind of crap. And neither will I! You must all be destroyed!   Hypocritically, I'm starting my own political party. Fred Party Platform so far:  Find that Osama guy Aquire Canada (except Quebec) Control Afghan opium fields for highly taxed and controlled marijuana market Bring back veterans' benefits John McCain for President Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General Miss Aretha Franklin, The First Lady Nationalized Heath Care, for the most part Change name of Rhode Island to Rhodeland, for obvious reason Bust Ticketmaster Dissolve Buffalo City Government/Build Bridge with money saved Move President's Day holiday to Election Day Kill Flanders One year of military/volunteer service for all young adults Honorary championship trophies for Cubs/Red Sox/Bills Leave the Indians alone End the Death Penalty (except for Flanders) Schooling no longer mandatory. Neither is giving health care or welfare to anyone without it. One civil union is acceptable. Getting benefits from second and third marriages are not. If we ever have to fight another war, we're going to WIN it No more Income Tax; higher sales tax instead Broadband for everyone! National Identity Cards for everyone!  Fingerprinting too! Colin Powell gets an award just for putting up with the rest of us. 50 cent/gallon gas tax on personal vehicles to support better public transportation And we're switching to Metric, so forget I said "gallon" $1 coins, and no more pennies  I got more GENIOUS ideas, but it's late.

      I just finished listening to the Who anthology and I must admit I found them boring. They're good musicians and some of the songs are good, but I wasn't very interested. Once in 2000 I saw them play in Cleveland and it was great. I also remember their performance at that 9/11 concert, which was friggin' awesome. So, therefore, nonetheless, in conclusion, vis a vis et cetera, I believe the Who are a great band live and an OK band on wax. Led Zeppelin were so much better.  The joke I made up about Reagan was that his Alzheimer's is so bad he doesn't even know he's dead. Which may or may not be funny. I have FOX News on to watch the motorcade, because I knew (and assumed correctly) that they'd show the whole bloody thing and the other networks would find real news to report. If a car's going less than 90 on a California freeway, three hours of video by helicopter is unneccessary. The smog is really hurting the view, too.

      Finally, last night I read through the giant stack of Free Liberal Weeklies that I've piled up over the past few weeks. There were at least a dozen of them from Minneapolis, Buffalo, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. The sad thing is that all these papers pretend to be unique in their own cities when they're really just the same as the rest of them. They all hate George W. Bush, they all think Super Size Me is a great Michael Moore-ian view of corporate propaganda and the American obesity epidemic, they all have a column by Dan Savage, and they all have the same pictures of the same women in their classified ads. Even the papers written in French are like this. (I think.) So while I'm waiting for two of these editors to disagree with one another, color me disappointed. The only thing I learned about local politics was that they're bad and getting worse, and I didn't have to leave my house to know that. Also, out of all these papers, Buffalo's Artvoice was by far the crappiest.

      I don't know why everyone mocks my posts when they are absolute genious. These literary masterpieces will be read and reread for generations. Future scholars will quote my posts in university classes and Wilco will set them to song. Shakespeare's corpse will be dug up and burned, and my cat will be buried in his place. I will die famous. News networks will interrupt their coverage to broadcast word of my untimely death and timeless works of art. Alpha-Bits Cereal will put my face on their box. Conspiracy theorists will assume I had influence in the highest levels of government. VH1 will produce both a clip show and a made-for-TV movie about me. Friends and relatives will file motions about my royalty monies that will hold up the courts for years. The Simpsons will reference me. Crying teenagers will hold sparsely attended vigils in public parks for me. Upon hearing about my death, President Bush will pull out all troops from Iraq and declare a War On Slippery Stairs. All because my weblog is the iconic, foreward-thinking voice of poetry that no one is yet to fully comprehend.

Personally I think it's the worst thing I've written in several years.  Speaking of bad plans, our group trip to Mount Rushmore has been shuttled; it seems that no one wants to drive 20+ hours without an air conditioner or a CD player to see a large rock in the woods.  I think differently, so if anyone wants to come back here and see it please write:  TomServo0's Rockin' Rushmore Sweepstates c/o Maple Syrup Productions 5151 Yonge St.  Just a pinch above Finch

      So far the trip has been a goof.  I finished my thesis three hours late, therefore making everyone else three hours late.  I also smell like maple syrup and that's not helping ANYBODY.  Jerry lauds the truck stop just past the Pennsylvania border, and that made us another hour late.  Megan forgot her purse; that's another thirty minutes.  Jeff is not in the room right now so I'll just say he's been really mean to me.  He won't let me touch the radio!  Anyway, pics tomorrow when we meet up with Ed, who for some reason needed silverware at 3 in the A.M.

       urlLink News   [Nota Bene: I do this to prove that I'm working.  So far, 21 pages not counting title pages and appendices.]  Background The past century in America saw tremendous growth in population in urban areas.  This was due not only to an influx in immigration in these decades, but also from the diminishing role of farm communities and rural areas in this country.  Where the majority of people lived on rural lands in the first half of the last century, those roles reversed since World War II.  Interestingly, the idea of the American school also went the way of the city.  Instead of stereotypical visions of one-room schoolhouses on the prairies, today’s modern American school is usually thought of as an immense superstructure of media centers, athletic fields, and numerous other amenities.   In most cases there have been many benefits towards the super-school model.  Students are able to access a wider variety of resources to meet their particular needs and interests.  Facilities can accommodate larger groups of people, and therefore become regional centers of influence much like a college campus.  There are downsides, however.  Recent events in Colombine and other large schools where shootings have taken place have had society and those in the field of education look at ways these super-schools are not working successfully.  Where some critics find these schools to be full of opportunity, others see students become faceless cogs in a greater, impersonal educational machine. More importantly, larger schools are usually found in suburban areas where an adequate tax base and a large student body within a reasonable distance from the schools can be found.  Such large institutions thrive in the suburbs, where a mostly homogeneous community is self-supportive.  In rural areas, however, incomes are lower as well as population density and availability of resources.  Large, consolidated schools exist in rural areas much in the same way as they do in suburban or urban areas, yet the costs of operation are much higher due to the distances covered by transportation programs (sometimes several hundred square miles), a greater dependence on state or federal programs (such as Head Start and the school breakfast program for poorer families), and the need for constant technological revamping.  Statement of Problem Since urban and rural areas have both dealt with high amounts of poverty, legislators, school boards, and educational theorists have generally attempted to solve rural problems with urban ones, believing that urban poverty is a greater priority and assuming that what works in the city will aid the country as well.  A closer look at evidence, however, shows that this is not the case.  In many instances the urban solutions proposed by government agencies are not useful in rural areas because the infrastructure simply does not exist.  Nevertheless, rural students continue to achieve satisfactory scores on measure evaluations.  It may be possible, then, to derive certain qualities from rural schools that may not only be exploited for the poor rural students, but can also be studied for use in poor metropolitan districts as well.  The community school, directly evolved from the one-room schoolhouse of days past, had a limited but solid record of accomplishment.  Some rural schools have switched back to smaller school systems, not to mention a very small number of urban schools as experiments.  What, if any, correlation is there between a sense of community in a school district and the definition of that community?  Is a community determined by the resources it shares?  Historically, what was the influence of community in rural schools?  Need, Purpose, and Significance of Study 	As previously indicated, rural schools were often treated as urban schools during reform periods in terms of programs and theories used, with varying degrees of success.  In order to be more effective educationally, low-income rural school districts were not considered from a community perspective but primarily by an economic or political one.  Rural communities as well had particular needs that required discussion and action, and the local school district needed viewing from the context of its surrounding environment.   	It was also important to reunify and strengthen the bonds between the school and the community.  The past several decades have stressed student and parent involvement as a means of development.  Physically, however, large school districts have actually pulled education as far from the community foundation as possible.  Simultaneously, the rural community shrunk as a whole, losing parts of its own infrastructure as industries, jobs, and people moved towards the city.  If students in rural areas were being trained using urban curricula, not only did they risk growing up unprepared to work around their own homes but their education forced them to move towards metropolitan areas as well, contributing to the decline of American rural communities. 	A separate need also had to be addressed during this investigation: that of pervasive and often incorrect stereotypes concerning rural and urban living and education standards.  Oftentimes, it was the urban schools that were thought of as poorest in the nation, usually minority students living in inner-city ghettos or housing projects.  Society believed that poverty is primarily urban, and that most government aid in education went to help those city students.  In actuality many of the poorest students were white, and a large percentage of state and federal aid went towards the development poor rural areas.  In the 1920s era researched for this project, state governments earmarked inordinate sums of money for rural schools to quickly instigate modernization programs, often with the belief that rural areas had to catch up with more populous districts.  Scope and Limitations 	The following project was a qualitative, historiographical study concerning a rural school, its phases of growth, and how elements participating in the school's development coped with changes in population and redefinitions of the school as an important fixture in the community over the twentieth century.  Much of the focus was on the growth of rural districts and reallocation of funds and resources to areas that did not have the full capability to supply all students with necessary faculty or materials.  Special attention was taken to outline debates over shared resources or utilization of regional services and non-profit organizations.   The study examined rural educational services both inside and outside the jurisdiction of Brockport, New York school districts during a transitional phase from one-room schoolhouses to a centralized school building.  This was done through the use of historical study that examined the more obvious phases of rural demographics over the last century.  Generally, changes in population led to changes in school systems: greater populations pushed forced many students out of increasingly crowded, one-room schoolhouses, and burgeoning towns built larger facilities in anticipation of expanding generations.  Less superficially, the interactions between school youth programs, parent organizations, government entities and local media outlets on the school would gradually change over time. 	It was the researcher’s assumption that historical traits and themes existed concerning school-community interdependence in rural areas that may be discovered through an analysis of original source materials.  Documents concerning specific schools were found in local education records and held by town historical societies.  Over time, local newspapers painted a picture of what most defined the surrounding community and kept an excellent record of school events as well as the participation level of the citizenry pertaining to school issues. 	Finally, the school districts considered was one described as “rural” by the state Department of Education, either by precedent such as the meting of funds or by designation on state-sponsored reports.  In order to ensure the subject studied (the soon-consolidated Brockport school system) was not unique; the school chosen had to exist in a greater area largely settled simultaneously throughout.  Specifically, former Holland Land Company holdings made up the rural parts of what is Monroe County today.  The study focused on the twentieth century as rural towns changed from frontier settlements to more permanent community infrastructures.

      It appears that only a small rotating cast of supporters and journalists put The Little Red Schoolhouse together, with diminishing returns. Begun in 1927, the eight-page monthly eventually became a four-page monthly, then an eight-page bimonthly, and then quit in 1935. Though many periodicals shut down with the onset of the depression, the fact that several of the dozen or so persons running the paper died during its run could also explain the mailing's deterioration. Herbert Winslow Collingwood, who spent four decades editing the farmer advocate paper the Rural New Yorker, founded the New York State Rural School Improvement Society and organized some 1500 school district meetings protesting legislative actions.  The first publication of The Little Red Schoolhouse printed his eulogy.   The last issue, on October 1935, printed the eulogy of treasurer Carrie D. Converse.   This fact could also symbolize the cause of one-room schoolhouses in Brockport: aged, passing away slowly and without replacement. Devendorf was not only the president of the RSIS but managing editor of Schoolhouse; secretary Ostrander is the only other person listed on the masthead.   The Hon Fredd H. Dunham of Batavia, who legally incorporated the RSIS, counted himself as a member of the organization.  He wrote several articles demonstrating how rural districts could licitly submit donations to the group, even writing form letters for school boards.   The dubious nature of such donations continued throughout the paper's run but the RSIS found no difference between village school boards using tax moneys for their aims and rural advocacy groups doing the same thing.  The first issue emphasized rural Brockport's minority struggle for district autonomy, but by 1935 the fight was futile. Lost lawsuits led to closed classrooms buildings. Public opposition quieted. The paper often used repetitive, sloganeering diction, rife with rambling, unedited sentences. It required donations to stay afloat, begging that rural schools put those donations into their budgets. Simultaneously, they argued against the higher taxes that would arise as a result of consolidation and the salaries of school boards. Articles were inflammatory and propagandistic. One would decry rural taxes paying for central schools while another would complain that country schools had to be funded solely by rural taxpayers.   Columnists described school superintendents as Czarist dictators,  the State Department of Education as despotic, and the state judicial system an open supporter of tyranny and despised dictators.  When democratic elections and referendums were held, they were fraudulent. Town officials performed a litany of conduct errors at each public meeting. And in each case, a Rural School Improvement Society member witnessed each offense for Schoolhouse readers, promising speedy legal repercussions with readers' continued support. The Rural School Improvement Society made Brockport's consolidation the centerpiece of its premiere issue in November 1927, months after the district-wide vote allowed the action.  "The village of Brockport with the aid of District Superintendent Fred W. Hill has apparently forced consolidation," the page-long article summated.   It explained that fifteen of the *eighteen* districts in the plan voted against the plan by a 52-530 margin.  The meeting on 19 July, held on the Normal School grounds, showed favoritism towards the villagers through its location alone.  Supt. Hill failed even to recognize John H. White, the rural nominee for chairman, and held a vote for village candidate Herbert W. Bramley instead.  According to Schoolhouse the rural folk then elected a rural clerk for the meeting in retaliation.  The author found rural voters frustrated, angry to the point of hampering procedures, and segregating themselves to the eastern side of the hall, opposite the villagers.  Brockport held the consolidation vote after the meeting, with both village people and townspeople in attendance.  Beyond the location of the polling, however, the article also debated against allowing voters who did not attend the meeting to participate.  Bramley allowed polls to remain open until 9 p.m., much to the chagrin of the RSIS.  Doing so gave village store clerks an unfair advantage by letting them close their shops at a regular time and still arrive for the vote.  The 968 to 386 tally supposedly resulted from this unfair advantage given to the villagers by a villager, who would not permit the recording of any official complaint concerning the process.  Within several paragraphs The Little Red Schoolhouse offered several contradicting arguments to account for their side's poor showing.  Though its opening paragraph stated that 530 voters in fifteen districts opposed the plan and only fifty-two supported centralization they presented no explanation of independent data-gathering.  The possibility existed that such a larger number of rural voters disliked consolidation but having only fifty-two in favor could not explain how almost one thousand persons chose in the affirmative in a place as small as Sweden, New York.  Holding a vote in the Normal School benefited all voters as it was immediately after a debate on the subject.  Farmers who did not spend much time in the village could have participated in the meeting, checked firsthand the state of the current facilities, and recorded a vote in just one visit.  By keeping the polls open until the set time at night Bramley not only gave more villagers the chance to take part in the vote but farmers, who might not have had the opportunity for the meeting and required extra time to make it to the village.  The article's account also notes a well-attended, active body of rural congregants; a meeting hall already half-filled with such a group could only advance their cause.  The Normal School polls in that place and that time represented the full spectrum of opinion concerning Brockport consolidation. The Little Red Schoolhouse was livid, and they appealed the vote immediately.  They mentioned a town clerk who said notices were not posted in his office.  Nevertheless, "a crowd of interested people gathered at the Normal Hall."   A small number of students preferred to remain in schools in such towns as Spencerport, Bergen, and Holley, and somehow those long trips outside of town were more convenient travel than their parents' trip to the village voting booth.  Without a hint of irony the author characterized those villages as "community centers of the various districts . . . capable of maintaining well appointed, efficient schools, and are desirous and competent of doing so."    Still, the organization voiced many fears of the anti-consolidation farmers.  Centralization of schools meant a loss of power within each community.  The promises of upkeep of Little Red Schoolhouses for elementary students, though not a part of the high school conversation, consistently crept into meetings.  The RSIS named the paper such to evoke that spirit of rural independence, and to push nostalgia for their adult members.  Each issue featured a picturesque snapshot of such a building submitted by subscribers, often schoolteachers who sent in their yearly class photo.  Whether by coincidence or premeditation, the third issue highlighted nearby District Number Nine of Pavilion, just a few short miles from Sweden.  "Needless to say," read the four paragraph caption on page 1, "the people of the district are proud of their 'Red Schoolhouse' and do not wish the district consolidated.'"  Rural voters were always outnumbered, and their independence led them to distrust outsiders and outside ideas.  The state legislature and department of education determined reform in central schools; by simply not controlling the meetings, some rural parents must have felt voiceless after years of case-by-case decisions about school policy made between themselves and their neighbors.  Suggesting the outsider officials trade their positions at the Normal Hall for work at Tammany Hall, the RSIS reiterated their belief in multi-district polling and their disbelief in the effectiveness of New York's consolidation protocols.   "HOME RULE FOR THE RURAL DISTRICTS" became the cry for the few anti-consolidation activists inside the rural minority.  Addressing the necessity of such a group, the paper made clear its belief and mission: Had this organization been functioning ten years ago the deplorable condition which exists today in many sections of the state would never have come to pass.  The administration of the school affairs in district after district has literally been stolen from the country people by some nearby village which sufficient votes to do it with, or through the connivance of some District Superintendent . . . .   The nonprofit RSIS fought in Brockport, New York the same way they fought in Madrid, Chautauqua County, West Chazy, Marion, Williamsville, and dozens more towns: organizing local meetings, writing about 20,000 letters a year, and holding up all possible legislative actions in court.   Section 128 of the Education Law, which the RSIS said gave school officials such as superintendents "authority to secretly force consolidation", and Article 6-B, that required majority elections for centralization be held instead of district by district polling, had to be altered or deleted.   They garnered support from local chapters of the Grange, who made school consolidation an issue of daylong discussion at an annual convention in Jamestown.  One Schoolhouse article mentioned a rural Brockport resident who tried to meet with Department of Education Commissioner Graves about the upcoming consolidation.  Bound by law, the Commissioner was unable to speak on the subject because he would soon judge the case.  The author found it interesting that the rural voter could be brushed aside while someone named "P. A. B." could submit information that "practically" said consolidation would take place in a Brockport Republic and Democrat letter to the editor.  Schoolhouse openly supposed the Commissioner discriminated against the rural resident while running his mouth to whomever else he chose.  Sarcastically naming the insider "Poor and Blind" the paper charged "He [P. A. B.] evidently has had a thorough discussion of the case with some representative of the office of the Commissioner, to be able to print this advance information."   What the periodical failed to understand after many months of meetings and correspondence village of Brockport and its only newspaper was that P. A. B. stood for P. A. Blossom, former editor of the Republic and Democrat and the elected president of the district school board for well over a year.  Whatever "advance information" P. A. B. had--of which the Schoolhouse article remarkably did not specify--would have been nothing more than a well-informed opinion predicting a judgment upholding the landslide vote of 1927.  Just as the Commissioner "practically" broke the law that April, in August he "virtually" ignored Brockport farmers appeal when it was rejected.    A further injunction continued to prevent building until a hearing in February 1929.   Schoolhouse referred to "numerous witnesses [of the hearing], who testified as to the illegality of the meeting at which the vote was taken."   The paper printed no names to support the statement except for that of A. D. Ostrander.   The appeal lost again in the courts, but The Little Red Schoolhouse reminded its readers "the Court merely decided that bonds might be sold and ignored the constitutional as well as the other important points brought up in this case" and promised to appeal yet again.   On 16 October another hearing was held in the Court of Appeals; it failed again.  Judges interviewed the defense for the entire hearing while Ernest E. Cole, then Commission of the Department of Education, did not speak but "framed what the writer calls a 'wry' smile."

      Due to my work's location our customers are often foreign, and naturally some of them do not travel often.  When an Indian woman came in today with only Canadian money I told her we could accept her bills, not her dollar coins, at an exchange rate.  (Coins have to be rolled and it would take months to get enough Loonies to exchange blah blah blah.)  She put the coins back and pulled out Canadian $1 BILLS.  BILLS.  I can only assume that she was really from India and had either saved the bills for decades or gotten her money at a rarely used money changer's before she got on the plane.    We also sell a special CD single of the band Three Doors Down for *only* 99 cents.  I just happened to listen to it and guess what?  It's mass-produced crap just as I'd suspected!  The first song is a ballady kind of thing.  Or it's just long and dull, either way... the band sounds like an atonal Nickelback.  The second song is a hard rocker; at least, it's supposed to be, but the band sounded too bored to record it well.  If the songwriting were catchy and the musicians knew about accents it might have been entertaining.  A CD-ROM video features another nondescript song *and* a cameo by Dave Earnhardt Jr.!

      The most universal and accessible resources of Brockport's history must be those of its newspapers.  The Brockport Republic, formed in 1857, lasted until the 1970s.  Horatio Beach and his son Lorenzo, save for one year by Nellie Beach ran the paper from its inception to 1899.  The Blossom family members, also local, became editors and publishers for several decades more.  Simultaneous publications, mostly published as local advertising tools and not news sources, lasted for several years at a time.  The major exception was the Brockport Democrat, published by a P. J. Willson of Medina for most of its run.  The Brockport Republic knew much about the process of consolidation, merging with local competitor Brockport Democrat on 25 June, 1925.  As the name suggests, the new Brockport Republic and Democrat attempted to consider the entire political spectrum, showing favoritism for the locality more than any other entity.  On its very first issue under the consolidation, however, the newspaper covered the biggest local issue since the building of the Erie Canal.  The headline that day read, "SERIOUS PHASE IN SCHOOL AFFAIRS: HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SET ADRIFT BY STATE DEPT. OF EDUCATION."   Editors Blossom would soon insert their own opinions of the controversial matter into their paper.  Though alternative views were also presented over the course of several years, editors' anger seemed reserved only for those outsiders who proposed to thrust themselves into public discourse. For many years the citizens of Brockport were educationally privileged.  Due to the need for an area Normal School and the earlier failure of a Baptist College in the village, the state chose to settle the new school in Brockport's large, pre-existing facilities.  The state designated leftover room, such as the ground floor, for the town's high school.  Over time both schools grew considerably.  By 1925 the former Brockport Collegiate Institute building failed to provide adequate space.   Enrollment in 1926 would reach 235 persons for the high school and 185 in the Normal department; both were the highest attendance rates in their schools' history.   It should be mentioned that the Normal School always considered the high school a guest in their building; a verbal agreement between state and village had, since the schools' inception, left high school funding and administration up to the state.  Such an arrangement was unique in New York.  Other state Normal Schools, such as Geneseo, New Paltz, Plattzburg and Potsdam, held similar Normal/high school arrangements, usually for the benefit of future teachers requiring a place to learn their trade.  Those crowded schools were under written contracts that the state would not renew.   As the Normal School expanded, the expulsion of the high school dangled inevitably over the heads of Brockport residents.    Citizens needed to make several quick decisions about the fate of their high school.  For one, they officially did not have a school; the state "donated" all education up to that point.  Would the people support the building of a new high school?  Would they pay taxes for such an expensive endeavor?  The village was ill-prepared to lose their school as much as the town was to create a new one.  With a high school then under taxpayer expense, who exactly made up the taxpayer base?  Grammar school graduates from neighboring towns and villages also took part in the state-funded high school, albeit on a case-by-case basis.  Excepting those who would graduate in the next year (only 25 percent of the student body) the remaining majority had to return to those schools.  Some families of the farthest and most rural students often preferred to place their children in nearby one- or two-room schoolhouses.  If districts remained the same, parents might circumvent any newly passed Brockport tax raises.  In the same way, families who had nothing to do with Brockport or its high school might scoff at the consolidation of surrounding districts to increase the town's tax base.  Within several years residents would debate not only taxes and public education, but on the definition of their community.  Within a week, District Superintendent Fred Hill would suggest the "community" include the whole of Sweden (the town which Brockport was located), all of Clarkson town, and parts of Parma and Adams Basin.  The "absolute order abolishing the High School," Blossom wrote,  came "like a thunderbolt on the people of Brockport."  Two months after the original edict, in August the state allowed most high school students one final year in the Normal School building, halving the number of previously earned credits needed to remain enrolled.   Shortly afterward, all local students in Sweden and Clarkson's School District Number Nine would remain admitted, as well as students whose "exclusion would work a real hardship."   Amongst articles about fairs and picnics, however, the Republic-Democrat described emotions over schooling as "the uneasiness and anxiety which has prevailed among residents and the surrounding country," and the newer decision as leaving Brockport "temporarily relieved of a serious situation."   This local media outlet treated the school issue as an emergency, recommending students continue to find other schools to enroll in to minimize future scholastic conflicts. On 3 December 1925, the Brockport Republic-Democrat ran a notice concerning the high school question written and signed by a committee of the Retail Merchants Council of Brockport.  The result of a months-long study, the committee discussed the applicable Central Rural School Law  which offered numerous incentives to localities that consolidated small districts.  Detailing state-paid teacher quotas, schoolhouse preservation plans, and budgetary concerns, the authors described the law's implementation in Brockport as "logical" and "ideal."  The same article emphasized supposed tax savings for the public and the possibility of three times more public money flowing into the vicinity as with the current high/Normal plan.   The greatest detractors to school consolidation would criticize the organization of merchants as inherently anti-rural and pro-village. By this point the necessity of a new school seemed a foregone conclusion.  The possibility of rising taxes became the predominant issue for local residents, and an urgent one as well: the state cut salaries for eight teachers in anticipation of the schools' split, and those teachers threatened to leave.   Superintendent Hill and Normal School President Dr. A. C. Thompson held several community meetings to answer community concerns.  "It's your duty to attend this meeting and acquaint yourself with the facts," pressed the Brockport Republic-Democrat on 25 February 1926.  "It's your last chance."   Of the eight main questions listed by the paper as "most often asked," four inquired about budget financing.  During one March 1926 meeting a Mr. D. Boyd Devendorf, president of the New York Rural School Improvement Society, attended at the request of a rural district.  In fact, Hill moved the meeting to Clarkson so Devendorf's rural audience would not have to travel too far.  Blossom's report of the meeting showed readers not only how Blossom perceived the anti-consolidation Devendorf, but began to expose how the informed Blossom leaned ever closer to the state's point of view.  "Devendorf [sic]. . . hits at terms of consolidation law, but dodges issue at hand," the editor summarized in a subheading.   The executive secretary portrayed in the article failed to speak specifically about the Brockport situation but instead condemned the whole of New York consolidation rulings.  As the guest speaker would not comment on particulars, Supt. Hill rebutted many of Devendorf's broad generalizations concerning consolidation--it would make tax rates unbearable, the quality of student education would decline--with numbers that stated quite the opposite.   The Brockport Republic-Democrat described Hill as so flustered with the speaker's hot air that "Mr. Hill finally said to him: 'Mr. Devendorf [sic], I assume you are interested in the education of these children.  ARE YOU?' and Mr. Diefendorf hemmed and hawed."  Devendorf would later read the Republic article and write an angry response to the paper.  Printed in its entirety, Devendorf noted several occasions during said meeting where he stated "a very definite plan:" to allow individual rural districts to ratify consolidation instead of having the entire proposed district accept or decline the plan by simple popular vote.  Anything less would be unjust and undemocratic.   Though Sup. Steele of Clarkson, who hosted the meeting, and Hill both allowed Devendorf a period for rebuttal, Devendorf claimed Hill "was allowed to have his way."   Blaming the state legislature for reforms that left rural areas behind, the president attempted to "make it plain" in his letter that the consolidation issue had "been imposed" upon unknowing rural residents.  Downsides pertaining to Brockport were indirectly mentioned, though he reminded the editor of newly consolidated Trumansburg, where some students had to walk six miles to class.   In any case, editor Blossom, in his last few months on the job, seemed to take Devendorf's words personally and galvanized him towards a pro-consolidation bent. Several elements, general as they were, found sympathy with those in outlying Clarkson and Sweden.  If a new school would be built, what would happen to the current neighborhood schools?  Transportation--especially in winter--was always a concern.  Most importantly, however, was independence.  A theme running throughout the "School Wars," whether between Blossom and Devendorf or the villagers and rural folk, concerned the refusal of any one side to take orders from another.  Citizens inside and outside the village overwhelmingly approved a new high school, but some residents proposed a visit from Devendorf apparently to address questions about the loss of old schools and new taxes, not the new school.  One day after the publication of Devendorf's letter, the Brockport Republic-Democrat published a Special Edition: Supt. Hill, with the unanimous consent of trustees from all school districts, agreed to a singular, popular vote over individual district majorities.  "The greatest good of the greatest number," Devendorf quoted of the gathering, chaired not by Hill but the unanimously picked John H. White of Sweden.  "The meeting adjourned with everybody in good humor and we sincerely hope that future discussions will all tent toward approval of the proposed consolidation."  Suffering from a bout of the flu, Blossom waited two weeks to publish a reply to Devendorf in a column subtitled "READ THE TRUTH."  Sarcastically the editor thanked Devendorf for correcting his position and the correct spelling of his name.  Blossom's research on Trumansburg, however, revealed the rest of the president's letter to be out of context.  As the original reply complained of the usurpation of rural power by the village, Trumansburg was a poor example because a three to two majority of trustees came from rural districts, picked via popular election.  Long walking distances or not they had wholeheartedly supported consolidation, including approval of a $300,000 building when studies suggested a minimum $175,000 investment.   Blossom further criticized the plan of individual referendums, suggesting that richer, larger landowners could use the sparse populations in their districts to vote against consolidation and selfishly preserve their property tax rates: "It [individual district approvals] would give a district which would look like a checker board and be unfair to everybody."   In order to demonstrate his concern for the rural class, Blossom inserted for the first time "a bit of personal history" into the Brockport Republic-Democrat: "For Mr. Devendorf's information and those opposing consolidation we want to say that we were born on a farm, now have a joint interest in two farms, and all our sympathies, if the farmers were being manhandled, would be with them."    Here read the words of not only a village newspaperman, but an investing farmer willing to risk profits for the sake of public education.  They were also the last words P. A. Blossom ever published on the subject.  Son E. M. Blossom took the reins of the publication that July.  Father Blossom's name often graced the pages of the Brockport Republic-Democrat, however.  In the 15 July issue he could be found getting elected chairman of the Sweden school committee to switch that district from a rural school to a consolidated, Union Free district.   The next February, an all-inclusive district committee elected P. A. Blossom chairman of their transition team.   Immediately after the vote he was officially elected to the new central district's first school board and one week after that, its president.   Three of the five board members came from rural parts of the district.  E. M. Blossom showed an obvious bias from the beginning, publishing several long editorials supporting consolidation, promoting the benefits of rural school modernization,  and defaming the Rural School Improvement Society.  A petition pushing for an early vote on consolidation circulated on the front page.   Proponents of the plan were described as "farsighted and public spirited residents of the community"  while the RSIS had "yet, as far as we can learn, ever done a constructive thing for the improvement of the schools which they claim to represent."   The visiting A. D. Ostrander, the actual RSIS secretary and soon publisher of the RSIS paper The Little Red Schoolhouse was by all accounts of the Republic-Democrat shamed out of a town meeting when one congregant in the large crowd read one of his "letters to the editor" from another town paper contradicting the talking points of his speech.   "It is inconceivable," Blossom opined less than a week before the vote, "how anyone who has the interests of our children at heart, can vote against the proposition."  The vote to consolidate pass in a landslide: 968 to 386.  Further immediate study of the voting record also proved that approval was not a "steal," as Ostrander described, for without the participation of village voters the central school plan would still have gained a majority vote.   Nevertheless, the RSIS would fight in the courts what it could not win in the voting booths.  Within weeks the organization filed papers accusing the election of being illegal, thereby preventing any decisions to be made concerning site selection and construction.   It would be well into the next decade before Brockport could build their desperately desired high school.

        urlLink TheOmahaChannel.com       This whole gay marriage amendment thing smells like theocracy. And it's being pushed by a leader who smells like monarchy. As much fun as Europe was back in the days when Kings tried to be Pope, I'd like to move on to more inclusive administration. Why don't we nip it in the bud? Instead of a "no gays settling down" rule, let's amend the Constitution to ban presidents from having their siblings, offspring, spouses, cousins or any blood relations within two degrees of separation from taking their place. It would help ensure that our future leaders be of talent, not dynasty, and it could have gotten McCain elected instead. This is not to say, for example, that John Adams and son were bad leaders, but these Bushes and Clintons are getting out of hand. I  could  argue that back in Adams' time there were a dozen equally acceptable substitutes and that the modern era faces a dearth of them. What I  am  saying is that political parties now go by name recognition and electability instead of skill.  Consider the situation in India, where a Gandhi chose not to rule and gave the country a panic attack. Should we say that out of one billion people there is one family to rule them all? Of course not. Then why JEB and Hillary in 2012?

       urlLink Suitcase Yields Possible Beatles Trove   Horribly wack.  Mr. Jerry has decreed that even though I cleaned out the garage for the purposes of rockin' real hard, he doesn't want to hear it from the second floor.  In a cold Footloose fashion, he has ordered the drums out and banned rocking (and visitors) from the garage that he himself wouldn't visit (or clean) a week ago.  This is a rockblock of the highest proportions.  Maybe I can use my cleaning efforts as a bargaining chip to get his snoring Libyan arse off our couch and into his bedroom, where  he  belongs.

       urlLink Rock Paper Saddam   After getting my new University of Buffalo ID card I was able to partake in a few cheap-to-free software upgrades, including Microsoft Office and a $1.40 copy of XP Professional.  Apparently upgrading from Home to Pro can be hampered--maniacally--with newer DirectX and Media Player 9 upgrades.  The OS will install but be unverifiable, and I was unable even to log on to my own account.  Going to Safe Mode for System Restore doesn't work because System Restore didn't install either.  Good Buddy Joe, after a long night of hot dog fellowship and rocking with Diamond Dave Hill, was more than helpful finding fixes online with his laptop well into the night.  By 1:30 in the morning I was able to reinstall enough of the OS to--at the very least--boot.  I drove home only to find that it would not accept my wireless internet connection.  I plugged in an went ahead anyway, hoping that one of the 49 Windows Updates I needed would solve the problem.  Something must have happened with either those or my third attempt at Service Pack 1 because I finally got my wireless back at 5:30 AM.  This morning I woke up and it "allowed" me to put in Office Pro, which was all I really wanted to do in the first place.  Now the  only  problems I have are a help window that opens for no real reason at startup (which doesn't connect to the site) and a warning box at each boot that says "Installation Failed."  But everything else runs okay.    Thank you again, Microsoft.  None of your Operating Systems have crashed since Windows 98, and your technical help is far superior to the message boards that criticize you.  The past 24 hours have been gravy.

       urlLink Need A Loan??!!   Transferring all old blogs to Blogspot took several hours of dedication.  My desire to skim my posts from the past two years hampered the effort.  I did notice some themes, however.  My infatuation with Natalie Imbruglia's music, embarrassingly, is one of them.  It also reminded me that it's been a few months since I've listened to her albums and I should dig them out again.  Then--just now--it made me think about the number of times I've written about Natalie Imbruglia on the internet.  I Googled " urlLink Schrock Imbruglia " and came up with 600 entries.  Maybe three of them are mine, but now you understand the intertwinificationatory relationship our DNA-- OUR VERY BEING --has.  I also wrote a lot of posts about Subway Sandwiches.  That doesn't make sense at all.  I also found out  urlLink Kate Schrock  is a nationally known musical artist of the singer/songwriter variety.

       urlLink Me at a Teaching Job Interview   Front page news in Brockport, New York (15 September 1927):  HOBOS FORCED TO LEAVE TOWN  The numerous hobos who are making their home on the Fair Grounds were marshalled down to the Public Building Monday afternoon to appear before justice Homer B. Benedict, charged with walking upon or along the railroad tracks of the New York Central.  The unusual feature of the affair developed in the fact that Judge Benedict conducted court on this occasion in the open.  The thirty-five "hos," as they are known about town, all pleaded guilty to the charge, but were dismissed on the condition that they leave town immediately.  Thus was hastened the departure of these knights of the macadem whose annual inux into Brockport is occasioned by the hope that they may obtain employment at the canning factory during the fall rush.

       urlLink The Onion   I was gone for three weeks, and in that time my family didn't take out the trash.  I don't know why.  But in three weeks, many things can rot, stink, become covered in maggots, and fester in the August sun.  I returned home to find our trash room wreaking of ****.  The trash was finally rid of the other day, but larvae turned into beautiful flies by that time.  Now there are hundreds of flies in the house (I don't live in the house, luckily).  Tonight I found them swarmed together around a single lit lightbulb.  Other insects have been attracted as well, and in the minutes where I checked on the situation one stung me on the lip.  I also found a neighbor's cat in my kitchen but it ran off before I could catch it.  The moral of this story is: don't come to visit.  I need another vacation.

       urlLink    There's a giant war monument at the heart of downtown Indy.  You can go to the top, and Jeff wanted to take the stairs.  The actual climb--330 steps--wasn't that bad, but the humidity put saunas to shame.  We spent the next two hours wringing out our shirts.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Jeff and Ed collected some alternative newspapers for me to read from cities across the midwest.

       urlLink    On many digital cameras there's a feature that lets you join several pictures together, say, to show a large landscape or a 360 degree view of a room.  This was an attempt to capture the mural on the ceiling of Eugene V. Debs' house in Terre Haute but something went terribly wrong.  I had a dream that looked like this and starred Tom Selleck.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink ABCNEWS.com   Well that's ironic.  Anyway, the other day Joe and Dave and Joe and I  went to the movie  Little Black Book  starring the trailer-park cute Brittany Murphy.  Why?  Because we were late for  The Bourne Supremacy , that's why.  But it was a great film; we laughed, we cried, we sang Carly Simon songs.  I highly recommend it.  Then we went to a Ferguson Family post-wake party and filled up with Pigs in a Blanket.  THEN we watched  SNL: Best of Will Farrell  and called it a night.  It was one of those nights where you just end up doing stuff and they miraculously end up being really fun.  But Pigs in a Blanket are highly overrated; stick with the Triscuits and cheese.

       urlLink    Jeff and I unceremoniously blew out of Ed's apartment like bats out of Hell at 6:36 AM.  We had at least twelve hours of driving ahead of us AND we wanted to check out New Ulm, a large German settlement located farther from the Interstate than previously believed.  So we never made it back to Terre Haute as planned (costing us some motel money) AND we didn't see a lot of the cooler stuff in New Ulm.  But alas, you lose some, you lose some.&nbsp; urlLink
