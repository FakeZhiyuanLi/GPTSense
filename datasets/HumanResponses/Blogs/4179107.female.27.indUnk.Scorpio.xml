          Yes  !     Finally, I've a new hair....cut ( what were you people thinking ). I've paid RM24.00 to a professional hairstylist to chopped off my tresses ( I only went to them once a year since my parents are born hairdresser- -->domestic just cut and trim only ). It has been a long time it ( my hair ) rested on my shoulder and due to my forever mundane hairstyle ( it's either long or shoulder length and layered ), which I'm getting bored of and decided it's about time I make a drastic change after much pursuassion from my elder sis to tag along for a promotional hair cut ( buy one hair cut and get another of lesser or same valur free ) featuered in Aug Cleo. Ok I have to admit that I'm a bit 'cheapo'  urlLink   when it comes to hair maintenance. You can't blame me since my parents have great profundity in hair cutting.      Since I'm a paying a professional hairsylist and as a consumer, my expectation is very high. Not that I'm picky or demanding but I trust that every professional hairsytlist should be able to deliver a satisfying result for their customers. The appointment was at 12 noon and was later postponed to 1 p.m. cos we ( me, my mum and sis ) were late in departing from our house, also partly due to heavy traffic on weekend. Mum rides with us in Monorail for the first time. She was estatic bout the journey but not so on its built...cut short, I'm talking bout my hair here.  Anyway, we reached the saloon exactly 1.00 p.m. sharp. My mum had to wait for us to finish our hair jobs. Sat there for at least 10 minutes before being attended by a shampoo girl, tall, sweet and tanned..hmmm...lucky me, I aint a lesbian  urlLink   ...she starts squirting an exorbitant amount of shampoo onto my head and begin to lather until a whole huge 'clouds' rests on my head....before she does her scratching, I quickly demanded for a massage only, which she obliged. It was a good massage..the time frame for washing my hair lasted for at least 25 mins ( this shows how thick is my hair is )...yadda yadda yadda....my hair was cut by a pregnant lady, she was the 'boss' there cos' she instructed a trainee to blow dry my hair, definitely his first time judging from his technique and how he handles the dryer and comb...'beh tahan' ( eng: can't stand ). Lookinf frustrated, his senior took over, gosh 2 persons blows dry my  SHORT  hair.       After this ordeal, the pregnant lady ( I'm not a conversationalist, so I didn't get her name ) came back for her second feast. Apparently, my hair is not short enough per se, she politely asked for my permission to trim it shorter. Feeling reluctant yet desiring for a new look, I let her do her job. The end result----> felt that I've had a bad hair loss but was satisfied. My hair looked retro in the 60's era. She advised me to dye my hair so it won't look like a 'ball' ( she's referring to a coconut head ) and at this point of time I felt like reminding her that she's the one who turned my head looking like a coconut. Before I do so, she quipped by saying I should dye my hair so it'll look vibrant...surprisingly she didn't solicit me to do it at her saloon.

         My best friend (Gina) starts blogging since Feb this year thanks to her friend James (whom she knew online for the past 6-7 years) who gave her a blog as her birthday gift. Recently, my brother decided to create his own blog....hmmmmm...is blogging the ' in ' thing in cyberworld??? Or simply I've been ignorant with the latest technology updates?       Nevertheless, I don't want to feel 'left-out' and thus my journey of endless blogging begins. Once I started I can't seems to stop (esp when I'm darn free, read: my dept is overstaff), it's like being addicted to neslo. As a 'new born' blogger, I don't want to appear showy or exaggerating in my first post and yet at the same time I want it to be mild and subtle for easy reading.  Let's stop here and there's more to come   (",)  . Here's why I blog: -  · kiasu (don't wanna feel left out; everybody is blogging so why not me??); · my brain cell had ‘slept’ for a real long time and it’s about time it wakes up; · the desire to share my thoughts, life experience, juicy stories, gossips (another fave past-time) etc. etc. with my friends and family; · I'm single and have plenty of leisure time...sounds like I’ve nothing else better to do; · Uhhh...to improve on my English vocabulary; · what's the use of blogspot if you don't blog, I'm a person who utilise resources..   (",)
