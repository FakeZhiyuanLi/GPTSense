              So I got up at 10 and watched the various TV shows that I have on my TiVo.  If you can swing it, I suggest a TiVo with urgency.  Television is a wasteland, and though it is now more diversified than ever, it is also so much more abhorrent.           But that's not to say that television is irredeemable.  There is good TV.  Obviously, most shows that are created and aired by non profit organizations are worthwhile.  For instance, I find The Newshour with Jim Lehrer to be the best nightly news program on American TV.  And I have no doubt that it is because of the fact that the Newshour is on PBS, which is not beholden to sponsorship dollars from any sort of advertisement that results in money changing hands and benefiting the advertiser.  Certainly there are sponsors (members of the public, including corporations that are mentioned on the air), but they don't sponsor PBS for profit.           The TV shows you find on HBO and some of the other pay channels (like comedy central and the cartoon network) can also be quite good.  And this is again because of a diminished dependence on advertising dollars from corporate sponsors.  In HBO's case, it is only beholden to its subscribers, who pay to see the unrated workings of the mafia, funeral homes and now the old west.           So you need TiVo to sift through the detritus and capture all the little bits of quality TV.  Even with TiVo, searching through all of the TV in the Cablevision middle package, I record maybe six hours of TV a day.  And I watch maybe two hours, because the rest is reruns of shows that I have already seen, but TiVo has been programmed to record.         But the best thing about TiVo is that you don't have to watch commercials.  I truly believe that the unbelievable flood of advertising into the collective human psyche every day is responsible for a lot of the truly fucked up ethic that is at play in this country and in the world today.  The desire to consume and profit seems to be at an apex.          Anyway, don't think I don't notice the irony of the above, which reads like a TiVo add.  And it is.  But it's an add for the idea of TiVo, not the actual TiVo device itself.  If it was called SpunkOut, I'd be pushing the SpunkOut hardcore.    That's what you get when you sell out the public airwaves.

      Two things have become immediately apparent.  Now that I have gazed at the fruits of my very first labors, I notice that      1.  I can't figure out how to format paragraphs

      I never much took to the diary thing, but we'll try this.   Me, well...there will be plenty of time to get into me, but right now I'm not really the point.&nbsp; Outside of my idea to make this blog.&nbsp;   Chris Heinz is on TV, introducing his mom.&nbsp;   I realized the other day that I am not even contemplating the remote possibility of four more years of the current administration.&nbsp; As a rule, I'm not going to ever refer to the assorted collection of excrement that is currently in office in the administrative branch of this government.&nbsp; They don't get their names into print on my blog.&nbsp;   Teresa Heinz-Kerry&nbsp;just came out to the tune of "Simply the Best" by Tina Turner.&nbsp; Which I don't really understand at all.&nbsp; Why do the democrats always have such shitty choices in music for their convention intros?&nbsp; I mean, the worst thing about Clinton last night was the reprisal of "Don't&nbsp;Stop Thinking About Tomorrow".&nbsp;   Bill Clinton = The Golden Child.   Fleetwood Mac does not do it for me.&nbsp; My father, an affirmed former Fleetwood Mac fan, can't even explain it to me, the&nbsp;whole Fleetwood Mac deal.&nbsp; They&nbsp;are not good in any way that I can hear.   Anyway, I can see how this blog will have it's purposes.&nbsp; Like I said, there will be more on the way.&nbsp; You can email me at  urlLink mrkblog@optonline.net &nbsp;(I'm impressed that that just&nbsp;hyperlinked&nbsp;automatically).&nbsp; But if you mock, expect to get mocked.&nbsp; Im'a run this shit like&nbsp;I own it.&nbsp; If you are cool,&nbsp;and want one, maybe I'll let you post, too.&nbsp;   Now, to catch the rest of the Ketchup baroness of Pennsylvania.     &nbsp;

      I have filled anoter seat on my plane to the research station on Antarctica.   I saw a clip of Rick Santorum's infamous comments about homosexuals. Three weeks or so after Trent Lott made his unfortunate remarks about Strom Thurmond, Santorum likened homosexuality to incest and bestiality. But unlike Lott's comments, Santorum had the decency to make his comments to the AP.  And unlike Lott, nothing happened to Santorum. Not even so much a rebuke. Just shows that in this country, homosexuals are still firmly in the underclass.  Heres Santorum's comments in full:   AP:  I mean, should we outlaw homosexuality?   SANTORUM:  I have no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts. As I would with acts of other, what I would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. And that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual. I have nothing, absolutely nothing against anyone who's homosexual. If that's their orientation, then I accept that. And I have no problem with someone who has other orientations. The question is, do you act upon those orientations? So it's not the person, it's the person's actions. And you have to separate the person from their actions.   AP:  OK, without being too gory or graphic, so if somebody is homosexual, you would argue that they should not have sex?   SANTORUM:  We have laws in states, like the one at the Supreme Court right now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution ****************************  See kids, religion makes you crazy,  For what it's worth, the homosexual community is now pushing to have the word Santorum included in the common parlance. Here is the definition of Santorum:  Santorum: The frothy mix of lubricant and fecal matter that is sometimes a byproduct of anal sex.  No shit (npi): Check the website.  urlLink http://www.spreadingsantorum.com/index2.html

       urlLink    Rick Santorum is such a dreamboat.  It's funny that such a ridiculously crazy homophobe can look so utterly and stereotypically homosexual.  Sincere appologies to all of my gay friends, but you know what I'm talking about.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Until now, I have abstained from mentioning the current vice president.  But then I read about how Haliburton is being investigated for misleading financial statements in 1998 and 1999, when the bionic VP was president of the company (as opposed to now when he the president of the United States).                Do you know that our troops were asked to pray for the president?  It happened.  Here’s a link to the presidential prayer team.  You can sign up.  You can “adopt a troop.”    urlLink http://www.presidentialprayerteam.org/   The current President is a born again Christian.  Which means that he believes that me and you (assuming that you are not a Christian) are going to hell because we don’t accept Jesus as our personal savior.   HE BELIEVES THIS!

       urlLink    Here's him 4 minutes and 35 seconds in.  Though this photo seems like he's reading to the kids, he isn't.  He doesn't read books.  Joe Biden told me on the Daily Show.  And Joe Biden doesn't lie.  He's not even sitting up straight.  He's bored.  BORED.   &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here's the first one.  This one is 1 minute and 15 seconds after his chief of staff informed him of the second plane hitting.  How many generals can you call in 75 seconds?  None, if you're sitting on your ass in a classroom.&nbsp; urlLink

      I'm starting a push to get a plane that I can fly to the scientific research station on Antartica.  I get to choose the occupants.  They can live in as much luxury as they can muster, perhaps beneath some dome on the frozen plain of the barren windswept landscape.   But they can't come back.  David Drier gets a seat.  None of the major administration officials can go.  They get a special flight to the Hague.  They don't come back either.  At least for 10 or 15 years.  I guess that the convention was a bust.  Because the right went around saying that they expected Kerry to get a big bounce.  Fifteen fucking points.  Yeah right.  That way, now that Kerry seems like he’ll get a smaller one or one at all, it’s a “disaster”.  Why do these people think we’re all so stupid.  Very interesting on Bill Maher.  You see my little photo below.  David Drier and Bill Owens, gov of Colorado (R), refused to say that the current president wasn’t wrong when he decided to sit in the classroom for seven minutes after being informed of the second plane hitting the towers.  This has now become a fifteen minute segment on the show.  And they just keep defending him.  How can you defend this?  It’s utterly indefensible.  Let me see if I can find a picture of the  president in the middle of his moment of “looking strong.”  Now Nader is on Maher as a special guest.  Maher and Moore are going after him a bit.  Nader seems content and firm in his bullshit flawed logic.  And a little nasty in his worldview.   Maher and Moore have both gotten down on their knees and are now begging him.   Bottom line is Bill Maher rules.   I wonder if David Drier is on drugs?  He seems so steadfast in his delusions.

       urlLink    This is GOP California congressman David Drier.  He went on Bill Maher to do battle with Michael Moore.  And he got his ass handed to him.  To the point that I felt sorry for him.  Dave--you seem like a good enough guy, it's a shame that you shill for such douche bags.  &nbsp; urlLink

      ...that already, in the inarguably nascent stages of this endeavor, I am lax.  Oh well.  But now that I have witnessed the end of the Democratic National Convention and the birth of the new terror alert, I feel like I have enough to prattle on about for at least another spate of paragraphs.            Eleanor Holmes-Norton, the congresional delegate from Washington DC (sucks for her) is on the TV and has just seemed to endorse the torture of suspected terrorists.  Or maybe she didn't.  But Wolf Blitzer blows.  He harangued Howard Dean for saying that the Republicans use the terror alert system to instil fear in the American public for political reasons.  Blitzer seems to think that sort of thought is wacky, other dimensional bullshit.  Which leads me to conclude that my view (full agreement with the Dean perspective) is outlandish and in the vast minority.          Now CNN has some "expert" on the phone who is lauding the new alert because it is more comprehensive and specific than the ones that have preceeded it.        For some reason that I can't understand, CNN has a map graphic of this "expert" in Cambridge Massachusetts.  It's akin to the graphics that we get to watch when reporters are doing thier job from places without it either hard to take pictures or raining thousands of American ordinance from the sky.  Why the fuck is that in there?  It has nothing to do with anything.       The only problem that I have with Howard Dean is the fact that he is so extremely inelegant in his speech.  He has no nuance whatsoever and, though inarguably much more educated and qualified to be president, is only slightly more rhetorically gifted than the current president.  Case in point was his inability to make a really cogent case for his statements this morning.  In fact, his was such a blunt defense of his position that I wonder if he isn't doing the bidding of the Kerry campaign by sounding for the left, even if that sounding is blind anger.        As I said above, my problem with the administrations motives is Howard Dean's.  But I think I can do a better job of explaining it.  It is not because of the alert itself.  Certainly I don't disagree with the idea that if something is wrong, you tell us about it.  But my issue is with the manner in which this alarming is done.  The first commander of the Department of Homeland Security gets on the box and says that he has info.  In this case, he even says that he has multiple sources of info about multiple specific nations.  But that's it.       And this administration wants us to take it in faith that they are telling us the truth.  All that they have done for the past three and a half years is lie to us.  And fuck you if you don't agree with that last statement.  You're kidding yourself, blind and I refuse to listen to anything more that you have to say in defense of that position.        If they really wanted us to believe it, they could maybe get the people who are in charge of the agencies that procured those multiple sources and have them talk to us about what sort of sources those really are.  They have no credibility when they want us to take things on a faith that we do not have in them.
