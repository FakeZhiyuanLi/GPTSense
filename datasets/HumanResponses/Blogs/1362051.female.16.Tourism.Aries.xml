      wow. i never knew how bad one day could possibly be. i was skipping out of history on friday and savannah came up to me and was like "not cool, jenny. really not cool at all." so i was like "what the hell are you talking about?" and she went on to tell me about how james was outside smoking and got caught. so they took his smokes and he went inside and preceeded to buy some pot off some guy in his health class. so it turns out he was also skipping class at this time so the administrators came and caught him and shit. and then they took jeremy too. i still don't know what made them suspect him. but anyways, i had to go back to class and i had no idea what was going on until after last hour when savannah said that they found all the shit on jeremy and james and they were suspended for 180 days. that's 6 fucking months, kids. so i was in our car on the way home and i was crying like a god damn baby. and my mom bothered the shit out of me when i got home, trying to figure out what was wrong and whatnot.i still haven't told her. but jeremy called me later that night and he was at his grandma's house cause his parents went out of town. he said james was in jail and that they were both suspended. so it turns out they really only get 11 days which is the minimum. and jeremy has to go to ADC the whole time. he starts tomorrow. i probably won't be able to see him again for a week. i've been talking to him on the phone all day. his parent's get back tonight so if he's not grounded from the phone he's going to call me tomorrow. this whole weekend sucked. i had to babysit last night and i got sick and threw up twice. but at least i didn't have to go to church. cause it's a rule at my house that you have to go to church every sunday or else you're grounded for the week. but it doesn't count if you're sick. damnit. if my mom finds out about jeremy then she'll never let me see him again. ever. and i'm not even joking.

      hey kids! well, actually, i don't even know if anyone really reads this, but oh well. hello anyways! so i swore i would tell about jeremy.....we met on the last day of summer school last summer. all i remember from that day was sitting at fitzes in the loup that night with the whole crew and whatnot, and the whole time, i couldn't stop staring at him. he's beautiful. well, not like in a girly way or anything, well, you know how it is. at least i think you do. anywho, we hung out like every day after that, back in the good old days when emily still had a car. then i had to go to michigan with my family for a week. and the whole time i would lie in my room, listening to moth and thinking about him. i wrote alot of poetry that week. as if i'm ever going to share it with anyone. i never do. it's just too personal. anyway, the day we got back i was so excited to see him again, and him and emily came to pick me up right as soon as i got home, like we hadn't even unpacked the car, and he handed me this piece of paper and the front said "welcome back gift" then i turned it around and it was a coupon for "one free hour of jeremy love". hehe. then we drove to josh's youth group and we were walking around the church and we went into the chapel part and sat for a while. there was this huge stained glass image of a cross and i can still remember how beautiful it was. it was breath-taking. and then he started talking about how much he missed me and how he was wondering if i liked him all week and talked to emily about it and whatnot. and i was kind of scared of what emily said because i can only imagine how giddy i had been about him and i was hoping she didn't tell him exactly how much i liked him. i dunno, i'm just like that sometimes.... so then he asked me i wanted to go out with him and he was just so damn cute i couldn't resist. hehe. ah, i love that kid. then i had my first kiss and i'm still so glad it was with him. so now it's been almost eigth months since then. and now i love him even more. he just makes me so happy. with all of his little "coupons" and whatnot. damnit i'm so giddy. the rest of that summer was indescribable. it was just so great. my best friend emily was going out with josh, jeremy's best friend. it was perfect. i should have known it would never last. it was too perfect. so now josh is a dick and since then emily's gone out with james which ended badly, and now she's with max. he's so cool. and sometimes i think her face is just going to explode from smiling so much when she's around him. i'm so happy for her. cause i know she definitely deserves it. but everyone gives her so much crap for it. at least three people have completely stopped talking to her now. and it doesn't even fucking involve them in any way. damnit. sorry to cuss but if the situation is worthy i'll always be the first to slip up. ugh. i must say that today was an okay day. i got to have lunch with brady which was cool. then i didn't want to go to geometry so me emily and jeremy skipped last block and walked to her house. then we remembered that amnesty was after school so we walked back up to school. then we went to mr. jenning's room and there was a sign on the door that said amnesty was cancelled. so then we were tired from already walking about 4 miles at a rather high speed. so we rested for a bit and stopped by blue's house and he wasn't home. so then we rested a bit more. then we had to walk to my house, another 2 miles about. then my sister gave jeremy a ride home. and then emily left for san antonio with orchestra for the whole weekend. i don't know what i'm going to do without her. i guess i'll find out...... i was supposed to go help babysit at church but the kids didn't show up. so me and amy (my sister) drove around for half an hour looking for zombie road. we didn't find it. but we did find this bridge with this red writing that said "end of scenic limit, 1930" or something and it was kind of creep y so we turned aroung, got lost, and spent another half an hour finding our way back. i love curvy back roads. we found this farmhouse with a horse running around. in manchester, too. it was crazy. anywho, i think i gotta go now. buh-bye.

      wow. today really sucked. ashleigh won't even talk to me anymore. and she told britni that i supposedly called her a whore. what the hell. i love britni and if i ever said anything it would always be in a joking manner. jeez ashleigh i thought you knew me. and your the one who wants to kill nate for telling brittany all the crap you said about her. what the hell. today at lunch it seemed as if she was trying to come onto brady. did you notice that brady? i think she wants maggie to get jealous or something. i dunno. and my best friend emily broke down crying today because everyone keeps giving her so much crap for going out with max. like it's really their business to express their opinions of someone else's relationship to their face. emily never cries. it's the worst thing to see. i can't wait till i'm older. and i can move out. or move away. or just leave. i don't know. i've got to do something or else my head is going to explode. i swear.

      what's up. long time no talk. sorry about that. just couldn't find the time. things are pretty good. went to agape last weekend and san antonio the weekend before. finally home for a while and emily and jerm are grounded. oh well, maybe next week. made a new blog today, but i don't feel like sharing it just yet. maybe some other time. my fish smell and they're dying in their own sick waste so i think i should probably clean their tanks. fun stuff.  rock on.

      i broke up with jeremy. well, maybe it was a mutual thing. i don't know. we're still really good friends which is great. but my dad is really suspicious that we still hang out all the time. he probably thinks i'm a lesbian or something. oh well, he's got to find out sometime.... i was just kidding. summer school sucks but i found out that francisco is coming on the fourth of july! i truly ran around my house screaming because i'm so excited. you have no idea. for those of you that don't know, there's this organization that helps crippled children in belize come to america to get surgery because shriner's hospital does it all for free. so a little six year old boy named francisco gets to come and live with us while they fix his elbow. i can't wait! we saw pictures of him and he's SO cute! i'm really excited but i keep having these dreams where he comes and then he hates us and he tries to run away..... i hate dreams. anyways, so who's this "emily" girl, brady? sounds like someone's having fun at camp... hehe.... i'm hoping to go to the warped tour this wednesday... but only if my dad stops being such a dumbass nazi...... oh well, more later kids!

      what's up kids? not too much. unless you count the event of the DEVIL coming to live with us. i'm telling you that the child is a true demon. he was washing his hands and joey jokingly told him to hurry up and he turns and screams "SHUT UP, BITCH!" oh i would have died laughing if he wasn't being completely serious about it. the kid is evil and the best part is that he's playing on the floor right next to me making his cars hit imaginary innocent bystanders and he can't even read what i'm righting.  silly evil children.  they just never learn.

      hey all. long time no talk. i don't know why i say "all" when i only know one person that reads this. thanks brady. anywho, allison was supposed to get surgery a while back cause she has cancer but when they tried to put her to sleep she flipped out and pulled out her iv and went home. oh well. i don't know what she's gonna do. it's kinda hard to care when she's being such a bitch. i'm sorry brady i just want to vent for a while. i told emily how depressed i've been lately and she felt so bad and thought it was all her fault because she works and hangs out with max a lot and that made me feel like shit for bringing her down. i forgot how good it feels to write in here.  i try not to talk about other people a lot and i don't like putting my problems on other people so i keep it all locked up and this feels so good. i wanna recommend it to other people. sorry for any typos. i'm just writing what i feel. i love the rain lately. i dread the coming snow. i HATE being cold! aargh! oh well, i can't do anyhting about it. i might get to go to a jajapanese study group tomorrow at libby's. she's cool. ted might be there too. he'd be the cutest gay boy. i was talking about being gay in a chat room yesterday and this chick flipped shit and told me to shut up and go fuck my girlfriend. what the fuck. i hate people. shit gotta go. someone's coming.

      i need to vent. much. why does so much shit have to happen in this world? why do people do things without thinking of the consequences and troubles their actions cause on others? why do they only think about themselves? and how the hell can one person think they're better than someones else? i don't understand the whole fucking human race. so much shit is happening and i don't know how to make it stop. fifteen-year-olds should not have this much grief to have to deal with at one time. no one should. i just want to get out of here. danielle is gone. cotter's admitted her and she can't even come back to say good-bye. how can you go on for two years without being able to see someone you love? it's worse than if she died. if she was dead than maybe i could come to accept the fact that i can never see her again. but this is completely different. it hurts even more to know that she's there but i can't do anything about it. i can't see her. and it hurts. i just get this lump in my throat and i can't even cry. it's like i'm out of tears after all the shit that keeps happening. jeremiah's gone. they just fired him. i probably won't see him ever again either. and ben's leaving. he joined the fucking army. he's walking to a death that i can't stop. god i have no control in anything anymore. my mom won't even see my view of how badly i want to live with my grandma next year. i told her the obvious reasons of how i want the experience of going to a different high school to see what it's like. but i can't tell her why i really want to go. i want a new life. i want to get away from here and start over. so what if i'm running away from my problems. i figure it's a better way to deal with all of it than to kill myself. suicide is such a waste of possibilities. one person could be anything in the world, at least that's what they say. but maybe the lucky ones realize how insignificant they really are and end it before having to face the reality that you most likely will amount to nothing. you'll comtribute nothing to this world. not many people will remember you. you'll just be forgotten like everyone else. your "tragic" story will blend into those mass lands of graves that no one even bothers to visit anymore. you have to do something with your life. or there's no point in it at all. i want to hold on. i want to try and find something worth living for. but i don't know how long i'm willing to wait.

      ello.   francisco left today.   and jeremy doesn't talk to me.   and every guy i find even remote interest in as more than a friend is only attracted to slutty girls.   i'm writing a book.   i hate people.  i have so much shit in my room i don't know what to do with it.  i think jeremy still has my book that i wrote all my poems and songs in that i was too scared to show anyone else.  i want it back.  and if you read this jeremy then i want to know what the fuck happened to us.  remember that day of freshmen orientation in emily's room when you wouldn't tell me what you wished for on that eyelash because then it wouldn't come true but i made you tell me anyways?  well i shouldn't have done that.  cause it bugs the shit out of me everyday that we don't even talk.  it's bullshit.  i hope you're having fun with vanessa.  really i do.  cause you deserve someone who makes you happy.  i was shocked when ashleigh asked me the other day if emily has contracted AIDs yet.  because apparently there's a rumor spreading that she's sleeping around.  that's even more bullshit.  i still don't have my permit.  max and drew are getting their own appartment because allison kicked them out.  she's doing it so a couple can move in who have no home due to not paying their bills in their last appartment.  max and drew always payed their bills.  i can't even do anything this weekend because i have to set up chairs at church tonight for the sausage supper which i have to work at tomorrow and sunday in my spare time when i'm not being forced to babysit.  and i was supposed to finally hang out with savannah for the first time in who knows how long.  i don't even get to see emily.  or danielle.  fuck it.  i quit.

      i think i've waited long enough. i'm so sick of everything. i wish some cult would just come and kidnap me and let me live in the woods with them. honestly, i'm so tired of material shit. and going through days just to get to the next one. i just can't make myself stop crying whenever it starts up again. and i can't find any real reason to be sad other than the fact that i want to kill myself and my mom wouldn't believe me if i told her. she's obsessed with the idea of me going through some thing with my dad's work for counseling. i just want to be happy. but at the same time i don't want to talk to anyone. like i can't imagine just sitting and telling my fucking life story to some stranger. i just want to run away but i have no money and no place to go. god damnit. i just want to leave.

      i'm fucking sick of being blamed. and i fucking hate blaming others. life sucks. plain and simple. i'm sick of being told to cheer up. to just "be happy". ok so maybe i require medical attention or some shit like that. but i'm not happy. and nothing makes me happy. and i admit that yes, i've thought of killing myself. but it's such a chicken shit thing to do. i mean, why can't i just deal with shit and move on like the rest of the world. ashley's dad died. i've never cried so hard in my life. just the thought of not knowing for so long so i couldn't even be there with her. i mean i can understand how she had other stuff to deal with than call me or something. i mean, for two weeks i had no fucking clue that this man, who was like a father to me through my entire childhood, is gone. i mean, i just fucking saw him. and now i can't even see ashley. i didn't know about the funeral. my life just kept going while she was found her dad having a heart attack. i kept smoking pot or doing whatever the hell i was doing while she tried to breathe life back into her own father. the world just keeps going and leaving everyone behind. and i don't understand why i can't just TALK about this to someone. these little fucking pixels let me release what i can't even tell my best friend. i don't understand. what is wrong with this world? who is john galt?

      so friday i went to bed while playing the role of the angry child and woke up at 4:30 pm the next day. went "shopping" with emily (a.k.a. driving around smoking and then going to max and drew's) and they left today at one for florida so i was trying to just spend the night at max and drew's since emily was.... and i tried really hard..... but no luck. so i came home and went to bed stoned and full of peanut butter.... but i already miss emily and i don't even get to see her for her birthday..... i'm gonna miss you kids.... we leave tomorrow morning and i know i shall die in a horrible plane crash.... and they will blame it on terrorrists but no let me tell you right now the plane will crash and it will be all of my fault because i will have a panic attack from my claustrophobia and paranoia about people sitting behind me and then i will just light up right in the middle of the plane and everyone around me will get so angry and point at the 'no smoking' sign and i'll be like "fuck you" and then they will chase me down those tiny tiny claustrophobic hallways and i will jump in the cockpit and say "take this fucking plane down right now god damnit!" and by then i will have finished my smoke and i will flick the butt into the pilot's eye when he doesn't do as i say and then we all shall die. i really don't understand why my mom is putting me on a plane. i need sleeping pills. tranquilizers. i bought emily's birthday present and a new cd..... or two..... i've never shopped so much..... flip-flops and ashleigh jones and hair spray and little empty bottles that i can't wait to fill and i can't believe that you kids still haven't posted jesus' blog site for me......  help please oh god i'm gonna die on this plane and it's all gonna be her fault she knows i can't fucking stand flying i should have rode the greyhound with emily oh god what am i going to do someone please shoot me now.  screw "time to start" guys..... listen to "what is rock" by the blue man group.  new quote: "you can probably count on me most of the time...." (from the mouth of emily's mom)  i'm really gonna miss you guys in hell. i'll send you a postcard or two. oh god i always have suicidal thoughts but when it comes down to it i really don't want to die tomorrow guys. i'm really freaking out here. i'm gonna have a fucking panic attack just thinking about how i'm going to have a panic attack tomorrow..... fuck i love you guys. really.

      old quotes anyone?  "did you take all that acid?" "that's right! music!"  "he doesn't forgive..... he forgets......"  "mr. smith, please do not molest my children...."  i had a dream that i fell asleep and when i woke up my sister told me i had a baby and throughout the whole dream i kept asking her where the hell my baby was and all she would say is "it was an okay baby i guess, but it was no onion!" and then we got lost in a back alley and bridget just kept asking me who the father was and i just got so offended like "god damnit! don't you know who the father is?" but i really couldn't give her an answer so i slipped into the back of a church but the preacher man was reciting an infomercial so i just sat there until i woke up. and that is the end.

      alright long time no talk.... kind of.... but i've always wanted to talk about this and i always forget.... so here goes! (don't get your hopes up.... it's really not that amusing)   so this kid donny used to live at max and drew's old, old, apartment. (before that reign of ally..... ::shiver::) ok so they finally got him to smoke pot.... and one day he smoked some and then about a half hour later he burped and blew out smoke. and it was fucking unbelievable. but then he would do it every single time he smoked and it was amazing. and that's why i miss donny.  so anywho.... i have so many more quotes... but alas they have run up the stairs..... maybe later. but this may possibly be on of the last times i write in a long while. you see, there once was this girl who had nazi's for parents and when she got her report card in the mail, she couldn't grab it in time before mrs. nazi found it and said "jenny, you are fired."  wait, no, the girl's name wasn't jenny.... shut up. but i will become that girl god damnit! because mrs. nazi gets home at noon and can most certainly reach that evil piece of paper before i return to this concentration camp after a very long day of burning babies.... either that or i'll be at school....  i haven't decided yet. but i must go now..... "i am ashamed...."

      ok you kids don't have to read this really..... "i just wanna dance!".... but honestly i'm just going to keep typing..... i mean i really have nothing else to do..... but really just stop reading whenever you want...... no hard feelings.....  ok so this morning we're on hanna road and the fucking car breaks down in the pouring rain and i had to go get oldenberg but alas he had already called the cops on us because he thought we had had an accident. but this stupid fucking whore of a bus driver was yelling at me to "just move the cars out of the way! you're blocking the entrance!"..... what? so me and brett start pushing and there's really no where to go but uphill so we just stop once the car is at least partially unobstructive of the big scary bus drvier woman...... so i walk into japanese and tell cook my car broke down and i need to go dry off and i'll be back and all he says is "nehongo modo!" which means japanese mode where you aren't allowed to speak any english so i'm like what the fuck? and i went to negels room and dried my painting with a ghetto hair dryer......  so my mom picked us up after school and these two cops had pulled over the jeep-y thing and this nice kid justin from my math class is standing with his hands behind his back up against one of the cop cars along with another kid. and yet another kid was stationed in the grass debating very loudly with another cop and yet another cop was escorting the only female of the bunch out of the mutant jeep. and justin looked like he just wanted to throw up. and he was such a nice kid...... i'm gonna miss you buddy. don't drop the soap.  so i caught a ride to maggie's and finally got to smoke and it felt so good. but we started watching aeon flux (i most likely butchered that spelling) but i didn't know what to make of it..... butt sex and removable spines and anorexia and really sexy clones....... but anywho this kid kevin bracket (again with the spelling) came and picked us up and he kicks ass. he has the greatest sense of humor. so we went to his house and watched some scenes from school of rock. the mario finally called from band practice needing a ride so we could hang out and this kid that gave kevin directions was speaking so slowly..... and it took him so long..... and he made it seem like we would be driving for a good forty five minutes but no. we got in the car and low and behold a whole five minutes later we were there. so we pick up mario and emerald and head to  dun dun dun..... brian payne's house! (did you like that twist lindsey?) but he was filming some movie for a class where these drunken teenagers are having a party and they're really loud so this zombie wakes up (brian) and he's gonna go eat them but when he gets there he decides to grab a beer and play some twister. but in the end it's really like a lesson on how drinking is bad because some drunk guy is gonna give him a ride home (to the cemetery i guess......) and brian says "no. you're drunk man." so then he bites the persons hand to get the keys away and they're gonna zoom in on this fake bloody hand for the right effect and all.  so it was really uncomfortable being around all of those people and we were around the corner from max and drew's so i wanted to just go and get stoned but maggie either wouldn't or couldn't leave..... i still don't understand why..... but it didn't matter because we were outside smoking and this kid Ian comes out with the video camera and said he needed a shot of the front of the house so we could just stand right there. but anywho he was wearing a pink floyd shirt so, naturally, i asked him if he smoked pot and, naturally, he said yes so i ask this kid if he would give me some and he goes inside and gets his dugout for me and he had the cutest little piece from his mom..... and i got stoned. and then things weren't so bad.   so we left there and went back to kevin's and watched parts of labrynth (god damn spelling), detroit rock city (what a kick ass fucking movie), some of chappelle's show, some of thirteen, and care bears......  so now i'm home and my fingers are going numb cause it's so fucking cold down here in the depths of hell but i'm working in my free time on a note to my mother in the event of my tragic death. i'll post it upon completion. but how about some new quotes!  "i just heard you speak through my nose..... does my nose have ear drums? nose drums!"  "now, i said, hand over my FUCKING drumsticks mom..... please....."  "if the lesson is you are a penis with ears and a bad haircut, then yes, i have learned a lesson."  but now i am sad becuase i can't find the song that mario was singing...... and all i wanna do is hear it right now....... but all i hear is time bomb..... and for the life of me i cannot remember what he said the song was called..... but i wanna go look up that band Air or whatever.... and grand daddy....... good bye my children.

      to anyone who wanders onto this site you simply must visit www.stalkthatskunky.blogspot.com  lindsey i must say that you have a wonderful future. it's simply the greatest story i have heard in my entire life. you should tell kyle that he is the crow and how you two are bound to end up in an angry sex/love triangle eventually. ludlow lent me one of his mojave 3 cd's....... it's somewhat beautiful but certainly clashes with my psycho-groupie-cocaine-crazy present state of mind. that's right savannah.   "you know it!"   "party in my pants!"   how can someone so pretty have absolutely no personality...... should i ask him tomorrow? i just might. started another blog for myself and all of my sappy rhyming poetry.   "don't air-raid for that bitch. blah blah blah...... dominant male monkey mother fucker!"  "i'm the one smoking marijuana mother fucker!"  oh how i dream of the day when everyone can hang out in the back of a van with the curtains closed in some deserted parking lot in maryland or ohio or anywhere and smoke together in peace without that tappppity--tapppity---tap! of the cops on the window. and i will refuse to open those blue flanel curtains! and i will pass the bowl with a smile and know that it will all be over soon. know that soon we won't feel a thing as the cops drag us out of the van and beat the shit out of us for telling them to fuck off and we'll just laugh and be happy and we'll soar over the ocean because we're flying. we will fly. and beautiful steven simply must be there. because i think he has a van.   in other news you know that new-ish kid dusitin? with the long-ish hair? well he went to AA with magrini and he was standing in the parking lot  after school so i hollered out and asked if he needed a ride and guess what he said yes. so he lives right by josh gag me coll and he is a nineteen year-old  junior and he smells very good.  i was going to get mr. curtis ford so i could honor him for black history month and as i was taking him out of class ms. rejniak decided we needed to be introduced so she said "curtis this is jenny" and curtis sticks out his hand and says "hello jenny" and it was the most ridiculus thing that happened all day. maybe you had to be there.   so now i've started a new paragraph for the sole purpose of rambling. and i want to talk about everything thing known to man and more if only my fingers would not rot and die with time. i would type forever...... if only someone would read my ramblings maybe someone would finally understand me but alas i realize that most of you have quit reading by now or are about to and i don't really care because this is for me god damnit and this is my happy time.   don't you love the world "fuck"? how could you not? ever seen the boondock saints? "how the fuck did you two fucks fuck?" "make like a banana and get the fuck out" or some shit like that but i really do wish that i had a religion because maybe then i would have something to look forward to. but i don't want anything out there. i want my own religion. and i want to be the president. that's right. "you know it!" and adorable matthew would be my vice president because then everyone would vote for us because he's just so darn cute. ::sigh::   i really should go to bed now and holy shit i forgot that tomorrow i am "hanging out" with mario and maggie and that kid they call kevin and oh no i never asked the parentals and i'm so fucking slap happy right now because i'm tired and i think i'm going to erase all of those shitty ass sappy and depressing blogs i wrote all of those times before. but i really must go. good night and good luck in finding something to wear tomorrow that will make people wonder why they are admiring someone's clothes while people are starving in this world. oh and don't forget to wear matching shoes.

      hey look maggie i updated my blog..... woohoo...... alright so i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired and i'm just fed up with being sad and angry. we're gonna be poor. my dad's getting the boot. so he's gotta find a new job somehow..... i'm done with being young i mean i wasted the "best days" anyhow. i might as well grow up. i need a job. and a licsense. oh i'm getting my permit on friday. but anywho i'm gonna be happy damnit. or at least i'm gonna pretend to be just so everyone else is happy.... but oh wait..... that's what i already do..... i've come to the realization that i'm only truly happy for about 2 hours a day.... and the rest of the time i just fake it. what a shitty way to live, eh? but i always told myself that this would be a happy blog so a happy blog it shall be! damnit. lindsey i have a globe and no one would notice if it was gone. oh max gave me a movie called "freaks" from 1932 and it's about all of these human oddities in a carnival and you learn that the beautiful people are the real monsters. i need to watch it. oh no emily! what's gonna happen at 7:57??? holy shit! mr. pixie don't make me make you hit me! ah mr. batty.... but more on this later children.... dude emily that's hard to understand now and i'm not even stoned. i think one of the worst feelings in the world is sitting at home at night sober and wishing you would have hit that pipe a couple more times so maybe you wouldn't be so..... blah.... i don't know i could tell you thousands of feelings i get when i'm stoned but i can't tell you one i feel when i'm sober.... hmmmm.... shit bitch!  if i made a comic about the adventures of mr. pixie would you guys read it?  "blah-bi-di-blah.... i'm black!"

      i miss you kids. sitting around in your room and sleeping all day isn't as great as i thought it would be. i was actually feeling fine today, i just didn't want to go to school. in the spirit of the day, i went and got stoned in my garage which made me feel a bit better. i hope you kids had a nice celebration. as sad as it is, there's really nothing going on in my life right now to talk about. i need to stop procrastinating and make that damn mr. pixie comic already. jesus.  lindsey why would you say that to him? was it worth it? i mean it sounds like it was because then he actually touched you first by shaking your hand and you didn't have to molest him or anything.  i just want to scream "fuck!" in the hallways and run around barefoot and push people over until they're bleeding on the floor. that's how i feel right now. who's with me?  brady how did you change? i have yet to see you....   happy 4/20 everyone!

      this blogger site is no longer valid. a memorial service will be held for the beloved cheese who we lost just yesterday. he has gone to the big aquarium in the sky. you know the one. meet me there.  damnit all i have left now is my noodles. she's so depressed now. i want to make a grave site at the toilet where cheese was flushed but my mom knows that i'll do something stupid like that so she won't tell me which toilet she flushed him down. damnit. i'll just make graves at all of the toilets. even at school.   i need to take noodles for a walk. maybe the outdoors will make her happy once again and she won't be so lonely anymore. if she wasn't a bata fish then i would buy another fish to keep her company. but then she would eat him. and i would cry again.   lindsey i'm bringing noodles with me to guitar practice tomorrow. don't let me forget. she needs a taste of great fucking american freedom.  a sit-upon? oy oy oy oy oy oy oy oy!  pull over! "what's that?" "the sound you'll make in lindsey's trunk" "oh" (kyle puts his arm over his mouth) "mull mover!" (he said it would sound more like that because it would be muffled through the seat) what a great kid. i hope we paint outside in the rain tomorrow. oh please magical negel. "dennis did your platonic bombs finally drop?" what a sick old fuck.  jesus i love you "i don't wanna say dog....."  what a good day.   "no mommy i don't wanna play"  "wait for it.... wait for it.... BA!"  "mememememememe!" hey he sounded like beaker from the muppet babies. you know the scientist one. beaker, ha. i liked the dog that played the piano.   but seriously what old woman kept muppet babies in her nursery room? where do you but those?  "look at me i'm skinny denis!"  "allen power!"  "and i'm only gonna pierce my left ear.... and i've been working on this mustache all summer long..... and my favorite band will always be tears for fears..... and i'm gonna wear a pink tux to the prom." "do do... dododo... pink tux to the pro-o-om....."  i want a good christian band to just start screaming "fuck" during a show. and i wanna be there. they'd be like "fuck" and i'd be all "you!" "fuck" "you!" "fuck" "you!"   "what are you looking at mrs. something-or-other? your son's no prize...."  "i can't feel my face!"

      what the fuck is the address for jesus' blog? god damnit.  but hey, i'm back. and no, i didn't die. i did get kinda sunburned though if that counts for anything.   i really don't have any time to talk right now.  but i do wanna say this to lindsey: i'll throw in a shiny penny with that five bucks and gum if you'll let me give him a shower before. or i guess after would make more sense. no i just realized that i don't wanna think about that right now.  i need to go wrap emily's presents.  i turn sixteen tuesday. woot.  where did the word woot come from?  my sister asked me if i wanted to try a bite so then i thought of trilobites and asked my mom if my fossil collection burned up in the house fire and she said no and that it's probably just downstairs. but oh yeah, i said no to the whole trying a bite thing. the steak looked green.  i was shelling in sanibel and my mom found a big conch-like shell and something was still living in it so she called me over and she caught this other's guy's attention apparently because he walked up after i got there and said matter-of-factly: "it looks like you've found yourself a nice, healthy horse-cock there."  holy shit i tried not to laugh but oh what a failure i am.  that shit-fan thing is great brady.  i miss you kids.  see ya tomorrow.

      well hey kids i'm back. we were in decatur, illinois when my mom realized she was going 77 in a 65. she realized this at about the same time the cop's lights started flashing. it was amazing. it was fucking ramathorn i'm telling you. he had the fucking mustache and the dark skin. holy shit i was trying not to laught the whole fucking time because i just kept wanting him to say "do you know how fast you were going" or "mother of god" or something. i hope you kids know what i'm talking about. i will be very dissappointed in you.   "CANDY BARS"  oh man i should have said that.... i was sitting in the back and everything.....

      you know, you can relate and sypathize and talk through things. but no one will ever really understand you. you'll never even understand yourself. and i just can't comprehend these things right now. my eyes are flickering and all i can do is wonder whether or not i've done my homework. i need to crash. but in order to crash, i would have to do something to make me high in some way. and drugs are out of the question now. and caffeine hurts. i guess i'll just go and sit in my bed until i can't think anymore and at least feel like i'm asleep. who am i trying to kid? i tell myself that i don't need medication or any help for that matter but i really don't know what the fuck i'm doing. i don't know what's wrong with my brain. for some reason i think i would sleep like a baby if i was on the big couch in brandon jones' apartment. i just can't think of any other place that would make me actually sleep.

      so the plan was to hang out with emily and then taylor jones. so much for the plan. i was waiting for emily and this busted ass taurus pulls up and someone is waving so i go outside. max is driving and emily looks sad. when i got inside and smelled the nasty smell that is bruce's busted ass taurus, i understood the sad sad look of emily. so we go to the apartment and danny is supposed to be coming later so we sit down and they smoke a blunt and i sit there resisting peer pressure and telling myself "DON'T FUCKING SMOKE GOD DAMNIT!" so i didn't. gilbert calls looking for and eighth and says he's coming over. i open the sliding door and in walks gilbert along with shroat. i close the door. they smoke another blunt. i just sit there. again. i open the door and in walks danny. i go outside for a cigarette and fix the clip in my hair and danny goes "what's shakin', fancy?" and i am confused. i go back in and we watch some more fucked up anime called Evangelion or something. and i am confused again. shroat, gilbert, emily, and myself go outside for a cigarette. and car drives up and goes really slowly while opening its back window. it parks and a little girl in a catholic school uniform gets out. i was thinking it was max and drew's little sister katie except she had really short hair. oh but it was. she chopped it all of for locks of love and wanted to see max while their fucking grandma waited in the car watching us all smoke. emily goes inside to warn max and i'm guessing he's hiding all the shit because it takes a while for him to come out. anyways.... they leave. i call taylor because by then i realize what time it is and that i won't be able to hang out with her today. we watch more anime and they smoke a couple bowls out of this fucked up pipe gilbert got from pakistan or some shit like that. so they're all fucked up having a good time seemingly and i'm just sitting there. then i go out for a smoke and max comes out mumbling about how he wants those god damn kids to leave and that gilbert's pipe tasted like shit. that's when we realize that no one has any idea where the hell danny is. that's also around the time when gilbert and shroat come out to smoke these nasty little cigar things. and that's also around the time when shroat says he feels sick. and yes, that i when he FUCKING PUKES EVERYWHERE. and right about then is when he tells us about the rotten pasta salad he ate this morning. what the fuck. so max gets a pot full of water so wash it off the patio thing and as he pours it it fucking splashes back and there's vomit all over his bare feet. that's when i leaves the cleaning up to gilbert while he soaks his feet in the tub. and that's around the time when i go inside to find captain jack eating my fucking bouncy ball and going through all of my shit that the fucker had thrown all over the floor. fuck. so that's about the time when danny shows up again. and no one is happy. and no one knows what to say. and i just smoke a cigarette as far away from the puke as possible. and we thought gilbert and shroat had left but they're just sitting out in shroat's truck afraid to come back in. and they leave it up to me to tell blue to call them when he gets off work. and i smoke. and i think. and i don't know how things could have been worse. but i do know how they could have been better by me leaving to go hang out with taylor and brandon jones a couple hours earlier. and i still don't understand that fucking anime. and my brain hurts. and as of now i haven't slept in five days. and i need a cigarette. and my dog has a mohawk. and i fucking hate ferrets. and i'd be shocked if anyone was still reading this.

      i dreamt last night that i met a deaf man but i didn't know sign language and his little brother usually translated for him but the little guy was really pissed off and wouldn't bother to tell me what the deaf guy was trying to say. then he was standing in my kitchen and something went wrong and he caught on fire so my mom was just standing there screaming and i was running in my garage looking for the fire extinguisher. i found it and came back inside and told my self through the mess of blinding smoke "pin, squeeze, aim, stream" and put him out. he was a teenager and i fell in love with him. he was laying on my kitchen table in beautiful pain while the little translator brother boy was putting a bandage on him and i was touching his arm with my fingertips until i realized it tickled him and i stopped. we didn't need words to know how we felt. and i just held him until i woke up wishing i had the beautiful deaf man in my bed. it's crazy stuff like this that makes me cry at night. when you wake up and realize your dreams are nothing more.   i need someone. someone to love and to hold and to love me back.  i feel like a little girl who wants to be independent but at the same time is forced to rely on everyone else. i want to grow up but i don't want the expectations and responsibilities.  and i don't know what the fuck i'm doing here. i don't know anything anymore.

        Indie rock!  You're my most favourite type of music...  Your music channels lots of emotion. On the top it seems simple, but underneath there's always a deep meaning...  As your name you're independent from most of music!  Stay that way!  Good on you!  There's so much variation in your style...from deep and thoughtful like The Stills, to happy go lucky like Belle & Sebastian, to dancy and catchy Franz Ferdinand, and back to boogie down Hot Hot Heat and The Rapture...    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      and i'm not 'blowing up at you for being honest' i'm writing my own honest thoughts in my journal so that i don't HAVE to blow up at you in person. because it makes me feel better. and apparently you have a problem with the way i deal with things to make myself feel better. and no one is forcing you to read my journal. 'blowing up' would be yelling at you and causing a big scene at school until we both fucking hate each other and we can't scream anymore. i'm just sitting in my basement wondering what the fuck is going through your head to say such things and thinking and venting in my journal. and at least i've fucking tried to talk to you and that really makes people feel better when their own friends ignore them and refuse to talk to them completely. really, it does. wanna try?

      so you say you don't like drugs.... and then you say you're going out for a smoke..... do you see why i can't understand you right now? no fuck this i'm done with the whole thing because everytime i try to tell you how i feel you counter-attack somehow and make me look like the bad person when you started all of this shit. there's no winning with you maggie. and there's really no arguing with you because even when you have opinions you state them like they're fact and defend them mercilessly and don't give a shit if someone else's feelings are hurt. i learned that a long time ago. so i'm just going to stop fighting you and if you think you can possibly grace us with your prescense sometime that would be great. because maybe you wouldn't have to worry about me and lindsey becoming better friends with each other and not you if you would just fucking talk to us. and when did all of this start that you don't see why anyone would do drugs? you're talking like you are so against it and you would never touch the stuff and wait, oh yeah, you fucking did them too. what a great fucking way to start the day.

      when the fuck did this have to do with drugs? i mean, i hate to bring it up again, but i'm just in awe right now that this whole thing had to do with drugs and i never even knew drugs had anything to do with it? really though, how DO drugs have anything to do with it? the last argument we had about drugs is when you said you were quitting and not to call you if we were just going to be smoking so then we didn't call you and you got angry and said you were just kidding when you said you wanted nothing to do with it. what the fuck. now i'm getting worked up because since then i don't think any part of this fucked up fucking argument has had anything to do with drugs..... i mean sure drugs were involved with the lindsey thing but i thought the main ordeal there was controlling people and putting people in charge of other people and the drug thing didn't really matter is was just a part on the instance and what the fuck i'm just going to stop because i'm getting really worked up about nothing and i'm not angry i just have no fucking clue where all of this "blaming it on the drugs" shit came up and why do you assume that i think i can only be happy when i'm on drugs? what the fuck? i RARELY fucking do anything anymore and i could care less i'm not like some fucking zombie that just walks around school thinking about drugs and wait for school to get out just so i can get back to my precious drugs. what the fuck i mean sure, drugs make me happy. but that doesn't mean i fucking depend on them for happiness. i'm sorry that my brain is fucking unbalanced and i'm usually depressed all the time to the point of constantly wishing i wasn't such a chicken shit and could just get it all over with and just pretending everything's okay for you kids and my mom and that drugs just make me happy when i'm having a bad fucking day but god damn it's not like i can't be happy unless i'm fucking stoned or speeding.  I CAN BE A HAPPY CAMPER WITHOUT HOURLY JOURNEYS INTO THE WOODS FOR HERBAL EXCURSIONS.  god damn. alright now i'm angry.

      i could not care less about drugs right now maggie feldman. god damnit now i'm getting angry. i think it's great that you are quitting. i really do. i wish i could and i hope i will someday. i just don't see the point in quitting right now when they make me feel better. but god damnit this is not about drugs! this is about you saying you're not angry and then not talking to me and then assuming that i'm angry at you for not understanding what the fuck is going on in your head and yeah i'd like to forget about this whole thing and go back to normal but we can't just act like nothing happened. because we've tried that damnit. and i'm not angry right now i'm just frustrated and sick of the whole thing alltogether. is that how you spell alltogether? fuck it i don't care anymore. and maybe it's not being bipolar maybe it's just that you overreact sometimes and you usually realize it after a while that you kind of blew things out of proportion because you even say that most of the time after you've had some time to think. you know you have. i don't know maybe overreacting is better than just not caring about anything like the way that i usually feel. just take some deep breaths next time or i don't know go for a walk or something just don't freak out and assume that everyone is out to get you. i love you maggie feldman i just don't know what the hell is going on right now. but i do know this is not about drugs god damnit!

      i think it's funny that by telling you how i feel i'm "speaking for lindsey" in some way..... i wasn't saying "lindsey doesn't want you to tell her what to do". i'm saying "don't put me in charge of her and don't try to control people." which is funny how that means i'm speaking for lindsey by voicing my own fucking thoughts on the matter.  maybe you would "have some friends" if you would fucking talk to me maggie. everytime i come up to you, you just fucking STAND there. and what the fuck am i supposed to say when you glare at me or just refuse to make eye contact all together? and then you say you aren't mad. then what the fuck is up maggie? and i don't mean to be angry but it makes no fucking sense and i figure saying it straight out is better than bottling it up until i explode at someone else. i have to go now.

      as of now, i haven't left the house in sixty-four and a half hours. i've been sitting. and thinking. and sleeping. and reading. and painting. and you'd think that i couldn't wait to leave and go somewhere but i really don't want to see anyone. i just feel like shit mentally and i guess i'm just kind of going crazy right now and retreating into myself so i don't have to deal with anything or anyone.   last night i thought about getting drunk in my basement just for the hell of it. i mean, i knew i would be chicken-shit and not sneak out so i was like what the hell. why not. then i just kind of fell asleep.   maggie, i can understand why you wouldn't want to be around us when we're smoking if you're quitting. but please don't tell lindsey what to do. and don't put us in charge of her. please. because when you told us not to let her "get too fucked up", that just made emily lose some respect for you for trying to control lindsey. and since you said that, we didn't give anything to her. but that didn't really stop her. she just did stuff when she was alone. and that is HER choice. and no one else's.   as for me, i really don't see the point to life anymore. i mean, yeah some times are fun but most of it is really shitty. so if i want to get fucked up, i'm gonna get fucked up. i can't see any reason not to. and you kids don't have to worry about me committing suicide or anything because i would never be able to. as much as i'm sick of living, i still don't want to do anything as final as ending my life. so don't worry.   and i don't want to talk about it. i hate confrontation and if you try to talk to me about 'important' shit like this then i'm just going to get angry and yell at you for shit that's in my head. and no one likes to be yelled at just because the person is mad about something else. no one.  lindsey, i'm painting a picture of conor that i figured could double as my painting and my english project. i still have to find an "appropriate" song to  play for the class maybe. any suggestions?

      so grades weren't so bad this time around. i even brought most of them up. so the grounding thing should be lifted after i go to church today. then i can meet up with emily and get that quarter for lindsey. maggie, if you say not to invite you if we're going to be smoking pot and you're not into that, then don't get pissed off at me if we don't call. i'm sick of feeling guilty and my life is my own and i'll try to sympathize with people from time to time but jesus i don't want to listen to other people's problems anymore until i feel even worse. i've got enough shit on my plate right now and as selfish as it may sound, i don't want to put up with any crap from anyone. from now on, if something's bothering me i'm gonna tell you kids because i'm really fucking sick of keeping everything inside and acting like nothing ever happened. if you don't like it, then fuck you. i mean, it's been great, but i'm just really tired. of everything.

      i'm so pissed off and frustrated right now. i just don't know why. and i hate that i'm lacking in the coping mechanism department. i never know what to do. i can't express myself. i used to write and paint and such but i've realized how pointless it all is. it doesn't get me anywhere. it doesn't make me happy anymore. i'm too restless to sit and too completely uninterested to do anything. nothing is productive. you can write, but are people really ever going to read it? or get anything out of it? you can paint, but are people really ever going to waste their time viewing your work? or even bother with talking to you at all? you can read and learn, but what the hell do you think you are going to do with your "knowledge"? what are you doing in life that's so god damn important that you feel like sticking around? are  you  really getting something out of this?

      did you know that if you left on a spaceship and traveled at the speed of light for a year, then turned around and came back at the speed of light for another year, that you would age only two years yet earth would have progressed by 30,000 years? did you also know that if you go to steak 'n shake at night you can sit by a man named marshall and he will tell you such things? as well as some jokes.  a man is driving along the highway and sees this sign that says "a challenge to prove your manhood. 1 mile." so he goes and sees these three tents and the guy there says that he has to go to each one of the tents in order, and then he will prove that he is a man. he says that in the first tent there will be a bottle of whiskey. he should drink the whole bottle and then go to the second tent where there is a lion that needs his tooth pulled. then, in the third tent, there is a woman that has never been sexually satisfied and he should make her content. so, the man goes in the first tent and chugs the whiskey. he comes staggering out and wobbles over to the second tent. the guy hears the man yelling and the lion roaring and it's taking a really long time. finally, the man comes out with scratches all over him, his clothes now rags, and says "alright... now where's that woman that needs her tooth pulled?"

      so when jolyn left for her cruise she didn't take her 80-year-old dad. she left him for us to take care of. and apparently all of the kids were sick with the stomach flu last week and she didn't disinfect her house or anything. so thursday i'm sitting on the couch with mark and he's saying how he feels kind of sick and i was like "yeah, i don't feel so good either. but if i tell my mom, she won't let me go out tonight" so i went home to shower and call all of you kids and i felt like shit but i figured it would pass and i had promised you all rides to tyler's house and i didn't want to back out so i just ignored the dizziness and all. at tyler's house it just kept getting worse until i knew for a fact i was going to throw up. so that's when i went outside because i didn't want to throw up in tyler's house. anyways, when i called my mom to come get me, she said mark had just come over because he had started throwing up and so had the grandpa. i started puking and felt really stupid for ruining the night or whatever but no taylor, i wasn't drunk.... i wish....  so she came and got me and on the way home she called my grandma because she had been helping us all week, too. i had taken my grandma home earlier that day because her cough medicine wasn't working and she wasn't feeling well. anywho, my mom was leaving a message telling her what was going on when my grandma picks up the phone and apologizes for the fact that it took her so long to get to the phone, but you see, she had been throwing up since three and couldn't exactly run to the kitchen.  so we get to my house and my mom gets me some pillows so i can lay down but i have to go throw up again so when i'm done i look for her but she's in the other bathroom puking. and it wouldn't have been so bad but my dad was fucking having band practice downstairs and his repetitive jesus "music" was driving me crazy. we went next door to take care of mark and to call all of the parents to tell them we couldn't do the day care on friday and jolyn didn't have a fucking list of the kids last names or phone numbers. all we had was a couple work numbers and by this time it's like 10:30 at night. mark's just standing at the kitchen sink being sick and the grandpa's in the bathroom being sick so i have to run home to be sick and it all just really sucked. i've never been that sick in my life. but i think the puking is done now so i think i'm finally going to eat something to make this massive two day headache go away. i hope you kids don't get sick from me. especially you, lindsey. because you were eating out of my cup of ice.....

      mark: the 23-year-old living with my neighbor jolyn: my neighbor becky: my mom  so my mom was talking to jolyn a while ago about mark and she thought jolyn said something about mark having a learning disability or something but she couldn't remember what she called it. anyways, my mom was talking to mark a couple of days ago, and he was telling her how he met jolyn through his ex-girlfriend because they went to the same church. so then he starts telling her how it was hard for him to get girlfriends when he was younger because he was LDS. and how the parents would tell their daughters "you stay away from that mark he's LDS he's bad news" and shit but he said it's okay now because his girlfriend is LDS too. so my mom is thinking "LDS must stand for learning disability something.... i don't know" so when he's done, instead of asking him what LDS stands for, my mom goes "do you have to take medication for that? i mean, the LDS and all?" and mark just starts laughing and my mom is really confused and mark won't stop laughing. apparently LDS stands for latter day saints which means he's mormon and my mom is a dumbass.

      so my neighbor has a man living in her basement and she says it's okay if he helps us take care of the kids just don't let them get in the car with him or be alone with him and if he does take them in the car tell him not to be gone for too long. what the fuck. who is this "mark" fellow? we went downstairs so she could show us where all of the extra food and toys were and he was just waking up and he sat up in bed and held his head like if he let go it would just fall apart. at least he's cute. well, cute in a scruffy dirty kind of way. but oh well. and i guess i have met him before because i was walking home from emily's one day stoned as shit and there he was just sitting on her roof, watching me. i just don't get it. i mean, it would make sense if he was going up there to smoke or something, but he was just sitting there....

        FROZEN QUEEN/ KING You dont want love to come through to you. You like it the way you are. To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. You are already used to it. You say yourself that you dont need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you dont have time for these things. But in reality you are scared to get hurt. You feel safe where you are: by yourself, nobody can hurt you there. You invent your own relationship in your dreams. You just need to know that you COULD get a partner.

      i really like the idea of how i'm going to start hanging out with lots of people and meeting new kids while i still hang out with all of my friends now. but i also start to panick a little bit when i think about meeting people. like i know i'll be akward and stupid if i ever end up in the same room as beautiful steven. and i don't even like him. i just think he's pretty. man pretty. but i'll still act like a fool.

      i hate waking up. especially when your mom comes downstairs saying that the phone is for you and you sit up and have no idea where you are and realize that you haven't slept in your own bed for about.... five days. i just keep falling asleep in random places. friday: didn't really sleep. a little bit on maggie's couch, but that's it. saturday: emily's floor. sunday: jake's floor monday: right about here. in the office. with my head on the desk. last night: downstairs on my own floor.  maybe i just won't sleep in my bed for the rest of the summer so then when school is about to start i can fall asleep really easily in my bed for the first time in like a month or whatever and then i'll be rested. god i start panicking in a way when i just think about school starting again. like the seating arrangements. i hope we get to pick our own. alphabetical order ALWAYS lands me a front row seat. without fail. and i'll freak out. and i hate telling teachers about my paranoia with people standing/sitting behind me.  i don't want to start liking blue. because he is an alcoholic.

      last night geebes drove us to the loop for the midnight show at the tivoli. oh god. he put drew in charge of the music and we ended up listening to eighties tunes the whole way..... he was dancing like crazy too. it was wonderful. geebes and drew and blue all tried to sing the high pitched voices of the girls and everything. i wish you guys could have been there.  so the movie was evil dead 2 and i was the only one who hadn't seen it so this scary part was coming and i didn't know what was going to happen and BAM! drew squeals and throws his popcorn up in the air and it lands all over me and he's just laughing and my heart was racing... he scared the shit out of me.... they picked on me the whole night because emily had stayed at the apartment with max and i had no one to defend me..... and everytime i had a fucking cigarette drew was like "shame on you. especially you." just because he quit a while ago and thinks it's horrible that i smoke at "such a young age".  they were all really drunk. and i think geebes might have snorted a bit before he came to pick us up. he's such a weird kid...... so we're driving back and we stop at that gas station (maggie you know the one. the one with no bathroom.) and i find this like 40 ounce can of beer at my feet and i hand it to blue and he sets it down by his feet and later we hear this hissing sound and apparently there are holes in the can and somehow it was shooting up towards me so there was beer all up in my shiny shoe...... so blue chucks it out of the window on this busy street and everyone puts their seat belts on real quick in preparation of getting pulled over. but we didn't. so we're getting onto the highway and geebes is telling us about how one night he was really fucking drunk and driving on the same exact road except he had like "triple vision" or some shit and was demonstrating how he was driving and i had the only seat belt that didn't work so i'm holding onto the shit handles and drew is screaming like a little girl and blue starts to throw up a little bit. so geebes quit it. oh yeah so we finally get back to the apartment around two and drew and blue go up to the patio and i'm being the nice one waiting for geebes to see if he needs any help or anything and he goes to the trunk and grabs this box of beer bottles.  glass  beer bottles. all of a sudden there's this huge crashing sound and beer is everywhere and geebes looks like he's going to cry only he's too damn happy and wired to cry and there's beer in my hair. and on my pants. and, oh yeah, there's more in my shoe.    lindsey, you know the fun facts? max's "five fun facts"? you want to know what the fifth one was? because emily told me and i wish she wouldn't have because it's really no fun at all..... damnit.   the city museum kicked ass on friday and we need to go again to visit the feminine drew but we will bring the masculine drew along as well.   what a long post... i have to go feed my neighbor's cats and pick up a pack from emily's house for the show tonight. bye guys.

      i either need a completely new way of life, or i need to get out of here.  i really need to change. i just don't know who i want to be.  i don't even know who i am. how the hell am i supposed to change when i don't know what i'm already like?    i just get so many questions in my head at once that i wonder why i even question at all. i just can't see where anything is headed anymore. where things are going to get me. and why i'm in such a hurry to get anywhere in the first place.

      all day i feel stupid. and i know it's because of the drugs. but i don't know what's worse. feeling stupid or wanting to die. when i'm stoned i'm just happy and i don't care what happens i just live in the moment and have a good time. when i'm sober i feel stupid because of the pot but i'm just not happy.  i'm fucking depressed as hell and it's just so hard to think of how fucking sad i'm going to be now that i'm quitting.  i work every day this next week and i think i might just stay home and have some alone time and try to clear my head. i know i won't be able to make it without at least seeing emily. but i just really want to be alone.  i don't know if i've said this before, but i find it really hard to believe that suicidal thoughts aren't normal. i mean, it blows my mind to think that something like that never even crosses other people's minds when i think about it everyday. and this isn't a god damn cry for help. i'm not going to kill myself. i just think about it. a lot.   and i  know  i've said this before, but i really don't like talking about this stuff. that's why i type it into here.  i made this thing for you guys, in case you felt like knowing what's going on in my head. that way i don't have to talk to you about it. i have a lot of social problems. i never know how to tell you guys how i truly feel. and i really want to start being honest with you. i just don't want to hurt you.

      M:"i want to make a bumper sticker that says 'hetero and ashamed'. i mean, i'm all for equal rights and shit but why do they have to announce it? i want to run around screaming 'i like girls and it's okay!'. i think that would be fun. maybe that's it. maybe it's just fun for them." E:"what the hell is this song?" M:"i don't know, but it's pretty gay."  i wish i could remember half the shit that went down last night... i know we went and saw spiderman 2... and that there were at least two blunts in the car on the way there... and that beautiful steven was there...
