      I dunno who will read this blog, I haven't decided but, when I do I will share it with my friends...life has been a little crazy, last night Jake asked me to go to one of his friends houses to get wasted..yeah uh NO!  so everyboday thought I was gonna go with him, and I admit I was kinda nervous because I did kinda want to be with him, so it was closing and I called my dad and told him that some friends had asked me to go get some ice cream from somewhere..he believed me and I did feel bad, but I was excited and also scared..well Kevin being the friend I prolly needed that moment, told me not to go, that I could get hurt and that if I did he was gonna get his shotgun, and hurt someone....that someone being Jake.  so after everything was closed Jake said that maybe we could just drive around for a bit...I was ok with that..but in the back of my mind and looking at him..I felt that if I went with him something awful was going to happen...so I talked to Stephanie secretly and she came up to us and said " I thought you were going to come to my house for awhile"  and Jake told me that it was ok if I wanted to go with her...so I did..and when I got in her car I cried...I had gotten away from him..and I am glad..I don't know what I would have done with him...If I had went..who knows...

      well I guess I don't really need to update..I just feel like typing something, so I thought..."why not type in my blogger"  so last night...Brittany and Stephanie stayed over at my house..tons of fun..Brittany and I went to Hyvee to get sodas and stuff and on the way in, someone started waving at me, at first i didn't know who it was, but then I looked harder and it was John Huff...I think that how you spell it..anyway I started walking faster, but then he did to, I wanted to run but Brit wouldn't let me, so then he walked in and looked at me and said hi, and then he preceeded to follow us around the fricken store...it was all fun..and I used to have a crush on him and so that made it better...well we were getting ready to check out and he came up and asked me if I happened to know where the nuts were..and I pointed them out..and as he walked away..Brit said "why don't you check in your pants.."&nbsp; It cracked me up, and I couldn't stop laughing..and Jenny just looked at us weird...it was great!  today..well today I went to lunch with Brit and Steph and we went to Coyote...I saw Kyle and he gave me a hug...after lunch&nbsp;we left..and I&nbsp;dropped the "Olson twins" off...and then I got this call from Brit saying that stephanie had left her bracelet at my house...so I brought it back to her at 5 at Coyote...yeah then Dennis asked me if I wanted to work and I said sure...so I did...fun stuff...oh yeah Hi Mike if you are reading this!&nbsp; *waves*&nbsp; so anyway I stayed after close to watch Stephanie take the ice cream machine apart...adn Mike got me thinking why do I like Kyle?&nbsp; I have no earthly idea why...none...so maybe I should move on..maybe..but secretly I think he might like me too..but he will never ever tell anyone ..EVER..   so now I am at home...trying not to think about having to go to work tomorrow..I should go get some sleep, but I am washing my work stuff..and I have to make sure that I put it in the dryer before I go to bed...  oh yeah the title..of the post..that is a lyric from an Orgy song..its a great song!!!

      I have been thinking...which is a very rare thing for me...most of my almost 18 years of life..have been spent moving around...and over that time i have made a whole bunch of friends..but I am jealous of people who get to stay in one spot and go throughout their school years in one place...like my friends here in Sioux Falls most of them have lived their entire lives here...which is prolly really boring but..at least you didn't have to move and make new friends...lets see...Germany, Italy, North Dakota, Nebraska...and here...  if I could choose one spot to live the rest of my life in I think i would choose somewhere in Maryland...only because its very beautiful up there...or maybe Ireland...yep there too, because its lush and green!    lets see what am I doing today...absoulutely NOTHING...well maybe putting my new bed together because my father is never going to get around to doing it...because he is getting rather old..lol..not really..but it was something to go by...I have to go check my schedule tonight I think I work tomorrow morning..and 10:45...joy!  at least i will be doing DRA for the week..and not bakery..any more cuts and I am liable to sue!...lol  but thats it for now kiddies...I will probably talk to ya all sometime...hey when is the Concert Choir retreat anyone know..because I need to take those days off of work...  luv ya all

      I have been thinking..I know hard to believe huh?  tonight, two of my friends and I went out driving, and I thought to myself, this is super fun, the two people I have grow close to are hanging out with me tonight and we had fun...that is until some stuff happened...but I have been searching on the internet about what qualities make up a friend...heres what I found.....   Trust -- Real friendship is based on mutual honesty and trust. One way to build trust is to take the risk of sharing more and more about yourself.   Loyalty -- Good friends will be with you when the going is tough. They can also give you room to be crazy and make mistakes. They will forgive your behavior still like you. Real friends don't to gossip about you because they know and trust you.   Caring--  Real friends are interested in the details of your life. They remember stuff about you like your birthday and other special times. They remember your current fears and concerns, and ask you about them occasionally. They share in your joys, and hurt a little when you are in pain. They pay attention to your life, and let you know they care  some of these things, I believe may have been broken tonight, but I won't go into detail because I am sure most of you read my blog, and once you read this I am sure you will know what I am talking about...  but I only love most of you tonight...not all of you...

      thats right I said it...FUCK....and I will say/type it again...FUCK...my night has been a living hell...I hate the god damn milk machine, and I hate the god damn ice cream machine, and I hate closing, and I just hate everything right now...I feel like shooting someone...I don't care who...but I want to...you know I am sick and tired of never getting to go on break with people, I feel alone, and then I get quiet and people just assume that I am grouchy or in a bad mood, and when they keep saying it I do get into a bad mood...I become Cindel the bitch...and when I am in a grumpy bitchy mood, I don't want to be fucking touched or talked to...  anyway...sometimes I wish I would get into a car accident or that a car would hit me...just so that I could see who would miss me and who would come visit me...and I could tell who my real friends were, and so that I could just get away, just have a break from the real life and just lay in the hospital bed and have time to think...about the world...and about everything...  last night I had a dream....that I was floating in the sky, on a cloud of fluffy white stuff, and I was going no where..just floating, having a good time, then the cloud dissapeared and I started falling...and falling, and I hit the ground, and heard a crack....and then I died...just like that...my life ended...wouldn't that be the way to go...sometimes I wish I would die just to get away......  away from it all.........

      school draws closer and I slowly start to get excited..because yes I am going to be a senior..I am scared to go out on my own after high school, no more mooching off of parents, no more being a kid, its time to grow up, become an adult...Its the last year to feel like a kid, what with our last homecoming week, our last school dances, and prom...then its graduation...I am scared and yet I so want to be there right now reaching for my diploma...and just moving on, going somewhere new...I know one thing, once I graduate I won't be staying here for the summer, so basically this is my last year here in Sioux Falls..  right now I am sitting here thinking about going to work, I have one year left of my job too, I am going to miss alot of people at work...but then again, I feel like I have to move, so that I can make friends, I have moved so much that being in one place for to long..is boring...I need to get out, travel, be my own person...you know?  anyway doing DRA tonight..joy..something slack, that I know how to do really well...ack, I don't wanna close but I enjoy going, seeing everyone, an actually liking my job....isn't that weird, I don't think I have actually said that I like my job, and its weird I am sorta starting to like Mark...AHHH...but only this much *holds thumb and index finger a centimeter apart*  but thats it for now...  luv ya all

      well I decided that I wasn't tired and that I wanted to talk about work...don't get me wrong I like my job and I like the people I work with...but the whole buffet thing to me is stressful, like I told Dan, when I get stressed I don't like to talk to people, I like to get the work done and I like to get it don correctly....  ok, I have a crush one someone at work...and that person knows who he is, and he knows that I like him, and I like the fact that he still acts normally around me, to me that shows that he is mature enough to not let my stupid little crush bother him...  but now that I talked about that I feel better, so Kevin...you don't need to print that stuff out or do anything because I already gave my blog address to him..so...blah...see most of ya later on today!  luv ya all!!!!

      I went to that sight Alison and this is what I found...totally correct and really eerie!!  read it and you will agree!  Description of Your First Name of: Cindel Although the name Cindel creates an active mind and a restless urge to explore new ideas, we emphasize that it causes procrastination, lack of confidence, and the inability to realize your goals and ambitions. This name, when combined with the last name, can frustrate happiness, contentment, and success, as well as cause health weaknesses in the solar plexus, and fluid systems.  The name of Cindel creates a very versatile and creative nature. You are quick-minded and have the freedom of expression to mix easily with people. Because your feelings and desires are so changeable, you are never satisfied with conditions as they are. You have many ideas, plans, and ambitions, but too often they are for an easy way out of a difficulty or an easy way of making money. You seek change in order to have the opportunity for travel, new experiences, and new friends and associates. You find it difficult to systematize your efforts and to fulfil your obligations and plans as you are not inclined to apply yourself consistently to a job to reach your goals. Although you appear positive, you inwardly lack self-confidence and will-power.  tell me what you think!!!  luv ya all
