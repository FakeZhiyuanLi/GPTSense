       Two and a half years ago I purchased 20 acres, built a house, and moved to the country. As my foray into country living unfolded, I've learned a lot of things.   My quest (which&nbsp;my friends sometimes&nbsp;refer to as the road to insanity) came about because of a myriad of yet-to-be completely understood reasons, but here are the top ones:         I have a tremendous creative drive , but I've spent the last 20 years building software products. Creating programs&nbsp;can be&nbsp;fun, but are never tangible. Turn off the power switch and your work quickly migrates to the "away place." I wanted to build something with my own hands that would be here longer than the next  urlLink blue screen .     The idea of country living has always appealed to me.  I guess the image of having a lot of space and being surrounded by nature was part of it. Waking up, making coffee, and sitting on the porch as the sun rises is so much better when my view is not obstructed by the neighborhood houses. Its also pleasant to realize the quiet,&nbsp;dominated mainly by the fact that I no longer live at the  urlLink outer marker for 17C  at DFW airport.      I grew up in a small town in central Kansas.  At that time I really didn't appreciate what a small town was all about... my only thoughts were about how I was going to graduate high school and move to a big city somewhere. Now, as an adult, I understand the value of the small town and wanted my son to go through high school in a place that put more value on the individual than what clothing label they wear, or what type of car they drive to school. There's plenty of time later for kids to deal with that kind of shallow meaningless bullshit.     I wanted to build an estate.  I think our culture has evolved into a disposable society. We rarely build anything to last the long term. Contrast this with Europe where they still think generationally. I wanted to build something that I could pass on to my son, and him to his children. European building and renovating restrictions my seem harsh, but at least they end up with some history that you can actually touch. Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that as capitalists we can build empires... I just think that when we do, we should invest more for the long term, rather having everything be a fascad. Reminds me of the time I toured a multi-million dollar house and found out all of the decorative carving in the crown moulding was actually just painted styrofoam. Everything was laminated and simulated. "And they paid how much for this?" Nutshell: I'd rather have the real thing on a smaller scale, than a big bunch of fake crap. There are a lot of people caught up in the drama of wanting what they can't have, so they'll settle for simulated aristocracy. Its sad, but appears to be the driving force behind everyone's actions today. Hmmm... what was that old saying about putting lipstick on a pig?     Knowledge without action = worthless.  I reached a point where I began to realize that it was great to sit around and read books and build my intellect, but if I never did anything with it, then it was utterly worthless. How badly does the world need another closet Plato? And if I am going down this path to figure out life, then at what point do I start living it, rather than just analyzing it? In essence, I reached the "shit, or get off the pot" point. I don't think you could even calculate what our GNP would be if the entire country took that attitude all at the same time. One thing is for sure... we'd probably already have those Jetsons' cars and I'd be using a version of Windows that was virus free.      &nbsp;    Preparing the land     Starting with raw land and building something is like any other overwhelming project. Don't worry about the details until you're faced with a $3,000 bill for something you've never even heard of. At that point,&nbsp;just bend over and take it like a man (oh, and be sure to add another blog entry into the "school of life" category").    I found out that no matter how much you plan and prepare, unless you've done it start to finish before, you will not be able to correctly estimate anything.&nbsp;A good rule of thumb is to do your homework, plan really well, and&nbsp;when you think you've thought of everything and have a reasonable estimate,&nbsp;double&nbsp;everything and you'll be close. I call this the&nbsp;Plan Square Rule ((h*p*D) 2 &nbsp;~ R) where h=homework, p=planning, and R=reality. Don't forget the D which is the all important dumbass factor that must be applied to the equation.&nbsp;I have only presented a very simplified version of the proof by forward reference&nbsp;as I expect to post a complete blog dedicated to the rule at a later time. Overall the result of the formula only approximates reality based on how liberally the student uses imaginary numbers and what personal dumbass multiplier they choose to use.     To be continued...    &nbsp;
