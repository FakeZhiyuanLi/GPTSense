      What a wide open question! I am quietly contemplating meeting with a new physician on Tuesday....how will she accept my physical problems?? Will she just put me in that "category"- someone who needs a psychiatrist....oh, never mind, I ALREADY have one of those!! The humidity is rising, and my joint and extremities are swelling so bad...I feel so "sick"- I cannot even explain how it feels...I know I jusy put the air conditioning on, and I feel some relief. I so desperately need to be heard, to be validated, to know and feel that  that this doctor will take me seriously. I pray....I am begging my Lord for this doctor to be wise and compassionate...not judgemental. I need it to work out...I am running out of options. I need help! Please, someone help me!

      O.K., so maybe I am expectiong too much. I speak to people about the physical pain that I endure. I try to tell my story of frustration that I felt when no one heard my cries for help. And yet, I feel like I am talking to a wall...I see "blank" eyes, looks of incomprehension, of confusion! I cannot imagine looking at someone spilling their soul from pain, and looking at them without the greatest amount of heartfelt compassion and empathy. I guess I can see the story....we live in a busy world, a place where we just don't have time for other people anymore. I know that I have had times in my life when I have been too busy to be there for others. I am just so lost and empty from the lack of concern I get from people.......EVEN when I ask. I can guess that until I can eliminate the pain, I will contimue to have problems with this emotional behavior. Everyone in the medical and mental health community will continue to pass the ball back and forth until it is too late for me. I really don't want it to be that way. Contrary to popular belief, I find great joy in life.....I want to get it back!!

      I am starting on this journey.......I will have to see how it goes...I want the outcome to be that I believe in myself, that I will be able to see within my soul, and know that I am OK, that the world will validate me, that I can be happy. I have been struggleing with pain for so long that I do not even know who I am anymore. I want acknowledgement from the medical community...I want them to know how badly their lack of judgement has affected my life. I want to know what it is that they see when they look at me that makes them see a "neurotic" woman....I wonder??????HOW WOULD THEY BEHAVE WITH EXTREME PAIN 24/7??????
