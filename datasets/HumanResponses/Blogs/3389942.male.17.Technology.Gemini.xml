      Alright.  29th, Morning, I got up at 6:30 to get ready for the programming compitition. I got to algonquin at 7:30; Registration was between 8:15 and 9:00. At about 8:00 Kevin appeared at the window of the Optra (I was in the back with my laptop out and my music pumped up). I got out, and hung around with Kevin until Matt and Roland, the rest of our team, showed up. I also got to meet / hang out with John for a bit.  We eventually got in, registered, went to our room and started programming. the first 2 hours went well, we were laughing, having a good time. We even had the Carebears music pumped up [we were in a room with 2 other teams, too ^^]. After the first 2 hours we hit a little snag, and I totally just drowned out. I couldn't figure out what the problem was, and i just kind of shut down; didn't care anymore. After enough kicking I eventually took another look at it, then it was the lunch break.  I thought about it during lunch, and fixed the problem as soon as we got back into the lab. blah, blah, blah, stuff happens, and our entry is judged.  --> It didn't run the judges Map properly, the units were fucking up, everything was going wrong.  after the judge had marked our program [we didn't do well...], I was sent back to the main room to wait for judging to finish.  I looked at the schedule to see when judging was going to start, it was in 45 minutes, so I grabbed my keys, hopped in my car and went to see if Sarah wanted to come to algonquin for the judging.   When I pulled up to where her house is, she was in the car with her mom and her sister, and we both got out of our respective cars and had a little chat. turns out she was going to the mall, so I hopped back into my vehicle and drove off into the sunset- er, I mean, back to algonquin. wow, I'm tired.  alright, so I get back to algonquin, wait abit, final judging happens, Neither my team or Nick/John's team placed, but my team got Most Improved [A well deserved most improved, might I add].  After that I drove Kevin and Roland to Sarah's, got Sarah, and brought the whole crew to Compusmart to pick up some bawls. They had no _actual_ 24's left, so they made one with a 12 pack, 12 individuals and a big, brown cardboard box.  We went back to my house, and watched spiderman until everyone arrived.  the party was pretty sweet, I had a really good time. We watched spiderman, played music & socialised, watched flash movies, played videogames, and everyone seemed to be having a really good time.   Sarah went and sat in the corner at one point, but later on she ended up talking to Patrick for awhile, which was pretty cool. I don't think she would have enjoyed herself as much if he wasn't there.   Patrick is really cool, I mean, he's in grade 8, but I respect him more than most of my friends that are my age. I don't even see him as younger then me, it just doesn't register that way in my head. Quite the awesome guy.   I spent most of the time running around doing everything and talking to everyone... I had _lots_ of bawls.   Brent and Sam went on a walk at some point, and Sarah kept suggesting the idea that they were in my room. :s. that wouldn't be cool. I would have to sleep on the floor if that happend.  Roland and Kevin were the two huge nerds that they are; Roland said nothing and Kevin spent the whole time on the computer. Alan just sat there and played his guitar, but I'm sure he has other things on his mind anyway [He just started going out with Rachel ^^, thats soo cool, i'm happy for him, Rachels cool (alot cooler then his Grade 10 female friend {Who was apparently mad when he got a gf, even though she said he should date other people   } ) ].  and... that was that.  then, the next day, my birthday, I got Kill Bill, The Billy Talent CD, and a trampoline.  And worked on my anthro summative all day.  fun stuff,,, guh.  i'm going to die tomorrow from sleep deprivation, I'm still not done my anthro summative, I want to see Sarah as soon as possible (i always want to see Sarah as soon as possible, though, so thats not really somthing new), and I probably have to work on tuesday (just to spite me, so I can't invite Sarah over and I have to wait until wednesday).  Night, whoever reads my blog, --Grant

      Anyway,  Alright. I have my Anthro Summative, with a drop dead due date of Tuesday [I'm certain I can get it done by then], My physics summative is due at some point next week, the programming compition is... tomorrow, along with my party.  Fun stuff.  I feel bad in antrho, because I didn't do my homework for chapters 3,4,5,6, or 7... so I need to get those done. I figure I'll work on them after the summative is over with.  I'm in computer Engineering now... I drove to school today, in the Optra, so I have my incubus mix CD, I brought it in, and its playing over the speakers in the computer engineering room right now :).  "Whatever Tomorrow Brings, i'll be there",  --Drive, by Incubus  Just heard that. I guess it applies right now, I can get all this stuff done, I can win that compition, I can get through the rest of this school year.  Out of everything going on tomorrow, I'm really just looking forward to seeing Sarah the most. I love being around her, being with her, randomly talking about absolutly nothing, or having a conversation about somthing serious, its awesome.  "Its all been said, with the exeption for the right part... when will we be new skin?", --New Skin, by Incubus  What else is going on... Oh, Wilfrid Laurier University offers a 5 year program in which you get both a Bachelors in Computer Science AND a Bachelors in Buisness, which would be _exactly_ what i'm lookinf for.  I'm still going with the idea that I want to take over the dealership, and in order to do so, I would have to get my degree (4 or 5 years), then spend 5 to 7 years working at the dealership before I could apply to become an official Licensed GM dealer.  Anyway, --Grant.

      ---------------------------------------------------------------- I had this dream, where I relished the fray, and the screaming filled my head all day...   It was as though I'd been spit here,  settled in,  into the pocket,  of a lighthouse on some rocky socket,  off the coast of France,  dear.  One afternoon,  four thousand men,  died in the water,  here..   and five hundred more were thrashing madly,  as parasites might,  in your blood.   Now I was in a lifeboat,  designed for ten,  and ten only, settled in.  anything that systematic  would get you hated.  It's not a deal nor a test nor a love of something fated...   The selection was quick,  the crew picked and those left in the water, got kicked off our pantleg...  and we headed for home.  Then the dream ends,  when the phone rings, you doing alright?  he said it's out there,  most days and nights,  but only a fool would complain.  Anyway,  Susan,  if you like,  our conversation, is as faint as a sound in my  memory,  as those fingernails scratching on my hull. ------------------------------------------------------------------

      Alright,  I was in Physics class, and after the teacher finished the lesson, I sat back and started thinking.  I got this... somthing hit me. Not physically, no, an idea, or rahter, a path...  I don't know where it came from. I've wanted to be a programmer since I was 8 years old; i've been programming since I was 8 years old... but... While thinking about what I like to do, the aspects of my Job I enjoy, what I like to do while programming... I think I was _made_ to sell cars.  My brother Rob went through 4 years of Electrical Engineering at Queens University, and he now works at Ottawa Hydro; sure, he does random electrical engineering things, but want to know what the favourite part of his job is? Organizing meetings, networking with people, organzing and assigning people to do stuff; and he's good at it. enough so, thats pretty much what he does now... Thats what he would be doing as a car salesmen.  I really like working with computers, but all the mystery and appeal of working with them is gone; coding seems dry to me... but at my Job at the independant, i'm constantly talking to people; people who come through my cash usually come through again. I know a university professer, a women who owns her own construction company, a women who wants me to tutor her son programming... all these people who know me; even though I'm just a cashier at a grocery store.  I think I would really enjoy being a car salesmen. I think its what i'm built to do. And on top of that, the pay would be amazing, and I'd get tons of time off to persue other intrests [such as programming].  I scheduled a guidence appointment, and i'm going to talk to my dad about it, but yeah... nuts.

      Alright,  So I've got the programming competition coming up on the 29th. That should be intresting.  But what i'm more looking forward to right now is the party i'm having after the compition. I'm having about 18 people over, its going to be pretty awesome.  anyway, --Grant

      Alright,  Yesterday was monday. The drop dead due date for my anthro sumamtive was today. I didn't quite finish it... I just handed in what I finished on sunday.  On a topic totally unrelated to me not finishing my anthro summative, I had Sarah over yesterday. ^^'. It was fun, we watched tons of south park [all season 8].  ummm... My physics summative is due Friday, my Programming summative is due Friday, my Computer Engineering summative is... tomorrow, its a test.  umm...  I work tonight, for 3 hours [yay for $21!], I shouldn't complain, I need the money.  anyway, --Grant
