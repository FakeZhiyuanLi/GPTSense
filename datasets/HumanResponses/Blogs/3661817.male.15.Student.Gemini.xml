      Yeah, today was my bhorthers birthday.  today started off cool, my mom bought me this cheap little waterproff digital watch, so i dont have to use my other one while in the bahamas.  Then we went to the Subway where  igot the application from, and i handed it in. Then my mom went and gave me my money to use in the bahams.  I got ready, and by 6:00 we were ready and we went to the hospital to meet my dad, then we all went to brooklyn for dinner with my brother. My brothers girlfriends family was there too. It was really nice.  Got home around 11:30 ish.  Man, im excited about the bahamas....ah.....  Until Next Time.

      3 days until the bahamas.  Today was fun, woke up, and cleaned up, Vinyn came over danes. We all ate breakfast, and then we just hung out. I passed out on the floor as the two played video games, i was still pretty damn tired. Once i awoke we waited for a it, and Danes dad took us to the mal. Dane wanted to buy the Hellsing epsidoes on DVD, but for 30 bucks for 3 episodes, he decided to wait.  We learned that we can watch full episodes of hellsing on Winamp via the Internet TV option. So we d/led that and watched some, and at that tiem danes computer decides to go insane.  After the mall and waht not, we went to subway, where my friend nicoel was working. O yeah...she made me the best sandwhich ever. (thanks nicole) i forgot to hand in my job application, but i can hand it in tommorow.  Once i got hoem i cleaned up my room and what not, and d/led winamp on my comp. Sadly the videos were laggy. So i went onto my moms computer and downloaded the program, and the videos ran great.  Uh yeah, so thats it, sat down and watched some anime. Nothing new, but tommorow is my brothers birthday, so me and the family are all going to dinner and what not.  Until next time.

      Didnt get to go to NYC today. But hey im at danes hosue.  Today was good, woke up early, and sadly my cable was out and so was my phones (since we have phoens that run through my cable interenet blah blah blah). So me and my dad went out and ate breakfast at good ol Mohegan Diner. Fro mthere we went to go get my bike. yes! i waited for it for so long, and its a good ride, i dont know BMX tricks, i jsut use bikes to get from point a to point b.   Then dane called me when i got home, and i packed my stuff and my dad drove me there. We went swimming, and then we went to subway.  my friend vinny works there. we went to bust his chops on his second day. Sadly he didnt serve us. Then i aske dhim for an application, because i really do need a job.   yeah, then we came back to danes, and have been hangin out.  O susie....sorry for not answering your questions online. I was typing this, and Danes computer is muted, so i didnt knwo if you were IMing me. SOrry about that.  Until Next Time.

      Today started out boring, but then my grandfather came over. He took me to the mall, and bought me lunch, and a video game. Driv3r. Its actually pretty good. Its like GTA combined with The Getaway. All in all a good day.  Like 45 minutes after i came home with my grandfather, my friend Greg IM'd me and told me he was going to McDonalds. He asked if i wanted to go along with him. I said ok, and suprisingly my mom agreed to let me go. So after around a 10 minute walk i arrived, and after a 10 minute wait, they arrived. They being greg, my friend alex, and this kid i met once before named... Ben! Thats it, ben. We ate some McDonalds then ventured to the local Barnes and Nobles.  When we got there, Greg and Alex ran abck to Mcdonalds to go get another friend of ours, Chris. THe funny thing was that as they left for McDonalds, chris came into barnes and nobles. Me and ben jsut stayed in barnes and nobles reading some stupid books.  At one point i went to call my mom, and bumped into my wrestling teamate Ben. We talked about how chill Le Parkour was for a bit,  and how i should go to a jam with him next time. I agreed, and then continued to call my mom.  After that, greg told me the same guys were going to NYC tommorow to watch the movie, Fahrenheit 9/11. I wanted to go, but when i aksed my aprents, the answer was no. Gah, but they did say maybe next time.  I came home, and my dad opened a package taht someone gave him at work. 2 bootleg dvds.... he didnt even want them. We watched one, and it was crap, then we watched another, and it was better.  So today was a goodday, and tommorow should be good also considering that i am picking my bike up. w00t! so happy about that.  Well, thats all for today.  Until Next Time.

      Yeah, i had a pretty good day. Woke up late, why? Because of no school! O Yeah! Called the bike palce, my bikes in. I was phyched...bad news.... i cant pick it up until around thursday becasue paretns work(ed) late today and tommorow.  Once my mom got home, i went out and ate dinner. Then, i went to the movies with some of my friends. Dodgeball, one funny ass movie. I'd recommend it to anyone. It was so funny. The whole cast was hilarious. Not only was the movie funny, but the girl sitting next to me (kate) laughed nonstop, which made me laugh, and most likely the rest of the group too.  We went to Applebees afterwards (kate had left) I had an awesome meal.  My AWESOME MEAL! 1. A Cup Of Soda 2. A French Frie 3. A Stolen Mozerella Stick (Sorry nicole)  I had to leave before the rest of the guys, but when i came home my mom showed me this printer she bought for the digital camera. Its pretty cool, it prints.... photos, like from the store and what not. Then i watche dsome tv, washed up, and posted this.  All in all it was a good day. I sense tommorow to be a boring one.  Until Next Time.

      Yeha...happy fathers day toall you fathers out there. Blah, lets see... today started off with my mom yelling at me, so i was pissed. But then once i saw how much my dad liked my gift, it went away. My brother and his girlfriend came over, then we all went out for breakfst. Then we went to the store and my parents and i bought new luggage for our trip to the bahamas (8 days). Er....then i did nothing, just lsitened to music (most of it the new My Chemical Romance CD... i love it). Then i had porkchops for dinner. Hugn out for a bit, then went online, watched tv, and then came online and posted this.  Tommorows my last final for the 9th grade. Studio Art. Going to be easy as hell. Downfall? I have no idea what time my test is...and/or what room it is in. So i have to go to school early to find out when im taking it.    So after that test, im free for the summer. w00t!  I'll post tommorow.  Until Next Time.

      Well, today started off good, i woke up and my mom took me to get a new memory card for my dads digital camera (which he doesnt know he owns yet) and while there i picked up the new My Chemical Romance CD (thanks matt :P). Buy it! No matter what type of music you like.... well..unless you like rap...then well, your screwed.  After that we went to my aunts house, say some family, ate some food, hung out, listened to my CD, and suprisingly didnt get in a fight with anyone.   On my way home with my mom (my dad was performing at COntinental Arena for a doowop fest) she decided to buy a digital camcorder. I didnt object, considering im going to use it more than them.  And when i get home, i walk around for a bit, get a drink, go to the bathroom, sign on to aim, and wahts awaiting me? An invite to GMAIL BETA. I was phyched, so now   I have a GMAIL Acount thanks to my good friend ICE (YOUR THE MAN ICE).     Want to email me on my gmail account?  voididentity@gmail.com  o yeah! well, i will post more later.  Until Next Time.

      Thats what i did today. After psoting last, i went inside and watched tv, and ate something, then i lied down...and fell asleep...i took a nap...wtf.... i cant remember the last time i actualyl sat down and said.  "I need to take a nap"  Once my mom came home, she figured out how to use my dads digital comera, took pictures of us(my mom and i) and we left them on the camera, so he has some pre...pictures on it.  Tommmorow im going to my aunts for erm... i dunno, one of those family gatherings. Hopefully its not boring, and maybe i will go see dodgeball tommorow.

      Today I took my NYSE Earth Science Regents..... What a pain in the ass. Finished the test in a hour and a half, then had to sit around for another hour, doing nothing....In a blazing hot gym that smelt like sweat. Bah, came home, sat I my nice cool house...Listened to music, went on my favorite forums and what not.   O yeah, the fathers day gift came in the mail today. We got him an alright digital camera, a Canon Powershot A75. Then, my brothers birthday gift came ( he is going to be...... 23... I think O_O). He's big into things with cars and travel, so we bought him a handheld GPS Navigator... Looks like a cell-phone, but its just a whole screen with a directional pad. Pretty cool if you ask me.  Waiting for my dad to get home so we can go get something to eat...Maybe later I will go see Dodgeball.... I'll see when I'll get there.  Until next time.

      i felt bad that i didnt tell you guys about me... so i wil ltell you this:  Check out my profile :)  Otherwise, im sitting her, looking at this new an impoved website, made by the almight Ass-Wookie :), ask me for the link if you truly want it. Also, im awatching the very first rocky, man, what a classic. No wonder its on AMC  . Today was your average day, went to go see if ican go get these custom prescribed (sp?) goggles for my trip to the bahamas. My theory: "Why should i have to walk around squinting the whole damn time, not getting the full enjoyment of things, when i can get goggles, and use them time and time again". Hopefully ti works on my parents.  By today i mean June 16th (its past midnight, but i still consider to day, the day before, get my drift?).  Today today (said it twice because i mean june 17th) im getting my new bike. Haro X1 Backtrail. Yeah, my last bike was a GTI hand-me-down from my older bro. Lasted me for a very long time, but tis rusted and at its worst, hence why the new one.  So, thats that, i will post again later.
