       Ok if anyone knows a good hit man hook me up!. My parents have started WW3 and i get pulled to either side! yay sucky life! Anyway lets get down to the real reason i wanted to post, ok on gaia i got this pm it was did anyone ever tell you.. So i opened it and the kid said your hot as hell so in my mind i was thinking "who the fuck thinks pixels are hot?". Well I'll tell you who, 12 year old boys that's who. Seriously why the hell do i only get hit on by twelve year olds? It's not fair I'm to old to be hit on by 12 year old that's a 3 year age difference!! No one say anything about my crushes i know it's not any different but seriously.... Anyway i cantered presto today and i made up with Ana so were cool again. Elf boy hasn't been on and i haven't seen Ryu for years it seems i guess my RPG peaked and now is starting it's steady and eventual flaming death, oh well it was fun while it lasted. i guess I'll just stick to other peoples from now on.. It;'s sad to i thought that one was going to go someplace good and maybe like work and have a really story with a goal... It backfired and now I'm back to square one. Well my new underage stalker is bugging me and he can't see this (thank you parental controls!) so i got to go! Shimby

      urrgha I'd like to say one thing, who ever upstairs decided to make most boys annoying jackasses and all the good ones gay needs to be fired it was a cruel joke and there needs to be pay back. Take my current head over heels crush, Karl OK first off i have issues talking to guys i always have and it's not something that's gone change over night. So Karl well he probably thinks I'm a bitch who thinks she's better then him because i never say hi and i avoid eye contact and everything i know i shouldn't but i can't help it my mind completely shuts down around him. i can't even talk to him about anything with out stuttering or dropping something or making a fool of myself. i mean come on how hard is it to talk to someone one who's nice and rides horses and is not a flaming idiot or as far as i can tell gay? In my case it's harder then doing a bi cranial bi pass while riding Superman ride of steel. I wish i could just give myself a wake up call and get with the program and stop being a stupid wimp but it's not that easy. *sigh* this is Turing into more of a rant then a journal now isn't it? I'm sorry guys this is another one of those depressing blogs were some teenager who thinks she's the worst off in the world moans and complains... I'll stop now with his final message, save the whales and the other species of the environment, don't were fur and make sure you thank your pets for being such loving companions who don't mind if you cry into there shoulder. The same goes for friends and don't ever do something stupid like lose one over a guy because you never know when you'll need them or when you'll lose them forever to something bigger then us all. Hold onto your childhood don't let it slip away keep it as long as you can and don't let anyone tell you to grow up. Keep  your head up when you feel like crawling into a hole and staying there for forever and never be afraid to speak your mind. Freedom is only as free as you chose to make it and if you stop watching even for a second someone can take it away from you, the cost of freedom is constant vigulance thats what my history teacher taught me and I've made it my motto for the rest of my life. never think that one person can't change the world because you know what? they can and it takes that one person to change the way the rest of the world thinks. remember what your forefathers died for protect it well -Shimby

      yo just me and here we go. Ana's confusing me and every time i try to help it blows up in my face. kana's in the hospital I'm not sure what happened but we think she hurt herself over a grade and some other problems. I'm not her friend really but i am still worried about her and i wanna go make sure shes OK but i don't know what hospital shes in. it's the end of the school year only a week of finals to go and then I'm a sophmore... man it's scary i can't believe it i had a hard enough time maturing to freshman status what am i gonna do as a sophomore? blow it entirely? make a fool of myself and have to move to another country? i mean really it's not like i have anyone who really knows who i am, what makes me tick. sure my friends think they know me but how much of what they know is just part of this elaborate facade i put up around myself day in and day out? Is what they think i am what i really am? i can't even answer those questions for myself i don't know why I'm trusting complete strangers to answer them for me. i just wish like every little girl forced to grow up that prince charming will sweep down off his white horse and carry me away into the sunset were we shall live in happily ever after forever and always. but i think someone told my prince that my hairs always frizzy i can't keep my temper and my glasses are always crooked. someone let it slip that i try to pretend i don't give a flying fuck about what people think when it dictates everything i do. every day i try my hardest and then when my grades come they just show my lack of focus on homework and such and i know i can do better and it just kills me. i think I'm going to really make these exams count study like hell and do my best and then next year, no more fooling around I'm going to get honer roil every quarter and I'm not going to worry about the swirling vortex of evil thats edging ever closer. I'm going to reach that far off goal of complete independence and forgetting conformity. but i won' fall into drugs and sex to pull me through no way I'm going to be different I'm going to be a good girl who's not afraid to punch somebody who's messing with her and I'm going to love it. oh well i'm off to the barn peace out peoples  -Shimby

         Hey guys OK i need to put this somewhere so everyone will see the truth about my father.  He’s a jackass, he yells about everything and i hate being around him.  I couldn't ever stand it to be with him 24/7 because he has no idea what a father should be.  A father should be caring, not just about what you do but your life and who your friends are and what your friends are like.  A father should love you and respect you at least to the point that he doesn’t treat you like a second class citizen who has no rights and needs to do everything you tell them the minuet you tell them or they get thrown out of the house.  A father needs to be someone you feel comfortable around, not someone you have to walk around on eggshells because your afraid he's gonna blow.  You see i have a temper problem and i really wonder were i get it from.  Hmm maybe my dad?  He’s got himself a real anger management problem that he dose, and i can't stand it so as i think about Fathers day tomorrow i realized this, i can't give my dad a fathers day card because he's not like most dads, he's a tyrant who by some cruel twist of fate became my dad.  And i don't think i could reward him with that.... You know you love me,  Shimby

I didn't get much sleep though so I'm running on sugar and coffee right now so I'm all jittery and perky ~^_^~ it's fun. I didn't get to see presto last night but Ana's dogs make up for it, there huge. Grizzly is a akita German Shepard mix (right? aww I'm not sure) and Dakota is a German shepherd, there sooo cute! and there HUGE!!! i loved it. There was lots of new stuff i learned like FMND (you can guess what it means) and the fact that my RPG character is allowed to come back on the realm as a guardian Angel, a real kick ass guardian angel at that. Shimby BIA this is soooo gonna rock now all i gotta do is pick who the lucky person is to be my charge... ;) this should be killer fun, no this should be EPIC!!!

           Let me tell you a story. This story is about a little girl by the name of Shimby who went to the 4H fair saw the horses, now she is a full blown horse addict. It all started innocently enough, it was 4 years ago on a hot day in August, i was walking thorough the animal barns at the fair when i saw the horse tent. I smiled and said to my friend "come on lets go see the pretty horses!" and took off at a full run, little did i know how this event would change my life forever. The barn was deserted as it was after closing hours and it was only the 4 h'ers were left. There was this one horse, a big chestnut with a blaze, his show name was Classic car, but they called him Collin. I can thank Collin for pulling me under the devastating spell of horse craziness, it was love at first sight. The girl who owned Collin saw that and she let me into the stall to pet him and give him treats, I've been clinically obsessed ever since.      Now every obbsesion you just have to pass it on to someone, anyone you don't care who. i started with my best friend Chi,but to no avail, i stopped trying as i had no horses at my disposal to get her hooked. This year in August at, were else but the 4H fair i met my ridding instructor, Barb and started riding. The first horse i rode was lil Sonny, well that's not really true the first horse i ever rode was foxy and then copper at $H camp but back to Lil Sonny. He counterfeits which means he dose everything in his power to turn around and fuck with your head... Not very fun. But i was hooked on that little QTH buckskin so i couldn't wait to ride him in my next lesson, well i didn't Barb put me on Chaz a 16hh TB bay with a lighntnig bolt on his forehead, he's a hell of a lot different then little sonny and i fell of for the first time it was quite a learning experience I'll tell you that. So me and chaos worked pretty hard and i fell in love again. Now as the months went by it was finally time for my first show, i wanted to take Chaz naturally but barb put me back on lazy lil sonny. i won a few ribbons but it wasn't what i wanted. It would be another 4 months before i actually wanted to ride sonny instead of Chaz, all because of the INCIDENT. It was mid January and the snow was fallen off the roof of the indoor. Chaz being a high strung TB hated the snow and one day as we were trotting around the ring a huge piece of ice and snow fell from the roof and i got to do my jockey impression in the Wishing Rock derby. Chaz took off full speed and i screamed and hung on, finally being able to pull him down to a halt and jump off only to half faint. The next weekend i had a show on him and got 4th place and did damn good, but it ended my long time love affair with Chazy. A bunch more stuff happened but i don't fell like putting it down on paper, so flash forward to march 7th 2004 Heritage farm auction, we went up with out a trailer even the my mom had finally said she thought it was time for me to get a horse and barb agreed. We sat and watched the horses go by for auction when a  hh skinny as a twig chestnut Tb with  perfect diamond on his forehead two back white socks and a messed up eye and a cold (both of those we didn't find out until after) came out, the bidding started at 1000 dollars, no one bid the auctioneer lowered it until it reached 650 and my mom raised her hand, we didn't have a number. The jumped him and even in his weakened state he jumped it perfectly one other person bid bringing it to 675 my mom bid again 700 dollars, barb shook her head and went to go see him up close, thinking we were crazy as bloody hell, the auction closed and i had my first horse "Presto's his name and what's yours little lady?" the auctioneer asked me as Megan  M and P an Kelly hung on to me squealing happily "Meaghan" i said shocked and  shaking then i ran out to were barb was standing with my new horse and i hugged him around the neck and he whinnied as we slipped a old green halter over his nose and took off the western saddle and bridle. We borrowed bill strains trailer and brought him home to the quarantine barn that night. i was in love.     As Presto grew stronger and i started riding him it was clear that this ex grand Prix show jumper was not for a beginner rider, witch i was at the time, i had to learn fast, and that i did. After him taking off while i was riding him and me getting hurt pretty bad Barb started having doubts over my ability to control presto, she wanted me to sell him. I could never sell presto because the night of the auction i made him a promise, as cheesy as it sounds i told him he'd never be sold again and that he'd never have to go to another auction and that he;d be loved and cared for until the day he died nd you know what? I'm a girl of my word i keep my damn promises and I'm never breaking this one.     Flash foreward to yesterday, my little cousin Sammy had her first lesson and you know what? i finally found some one to pass the addiction along to, she's going to take lessons every Saturday on Ambie and she's gonna be the next little equestrian in the family. that's my story peace all Shimby

         Hey all why o why do i seem to attract stalkers? Seriously every day it;s at least one new one who randomly IMs me on gaia as i get online for the day... It's ludicrous i tell you ludicrous! and it's never anyone from my neck of the woods, no i attract wanna be gangstahs and 12 year old punks it's tons of fun.. Really it is. [/sarcasm] Anyway i found another barn that's kickin but it's more an adult barn then a kids barn so no shimby riding there and you all have no clue what I'm talking about and I'm to lazy to write out about it so i'll leave it for latter. Well as this is a wicked short post i'll try and write more latter but theirs just nothing big to report... you know you love me, Shimby

           Hey guys I've really gotten fed up with all the fucktards around this hellhole!  I mean come on, how fun can it be to ruin someone’s life?  That’s what there doing to poor barb; i can't stand it its all those damn mini van moms who are doing it.  The only thing they care about is making themselves look good and if one of them doesn’t like you they all hate you, i really hate Erika’s mom, my god that woman is a real bitch!  She’s a shark threes no doubt about it, i really can't stand her she grabs on to something and then make s all the other mothers who are all stupid sheep who would follow there leader to the ends of the earth.  No you know what they are?  There lemmings, they follow each other off cliffs if it meant staying with the herd and in favor, it's not like they could *Gasp* think for themselves.  URRAAGA!  It’s pissing me off to no end.  And then Meg’s mom is trying to get all them to take lessons with Margie, um no okay Stephane can not ride, hell i ride better then her she cannot take lessons with Margie and besides she thinks barb is the fucking center of the universe and everything she says is law.  But anyway none of you have any idea what the hell I’m thinking about anyway so i should prolly stop this mindless rant now shouldn't i?  OK on to more important things, like the fact that were painting the jumps at WRF, and Chris is having a field day with how dirty were getting, i mean take me yesterday, i was covered with paint and he was teasing me and shit, god i thought guys grew out of that by the time they were his age!  I guess i was mistaken now wasn't i?  Anyway Governor R is gone and now we have reel, this could be interesting, i wonder if she'll be better then the jackass who stole our money.  OK so he didn’t steal out money but he was still a jackass, taking gifts and stuff hmm-bad boy mister john...  OK i think that’s about it.  Hope somebody is actually reading this, or else i just wasted a hell of a lot of time...  You know you love me, Shimby

      Hey all Ever have those days were your just having the best time of your life and everything seems to be going your way? Well today I had one of those. First I worked for the first time today at the barn, it was fun really fun. But the good things started happening after work when I was just hanging out. First i rode presto and my God he was perfect, he didn't even flinch when Chelsea rode by on Fi in full canter! If he's like this at breezy pines I can say hello first place baby! The next good thing was you know how I've been scared to talk to Karl? Well I was grooming Holly and I was in her stall bending over to pick out her feet, and he comes down the aisle with Sterling, he sees the stall door partially open and shuts it, with me still in there. So his mom asks him what he's doing and he says the stall was randomly open, so I had to pipe up and say because I was in there. then we actual talked for a Lil bit.. made me feel all warm and fuzz... wait a second i'm starting to sound like a fan girl at a John Mayer concert no way in hell am I going down that road.... Any way you know what happened when you have great days like that? Well bad things happen, thats what. Mandy has been leasing Jete for about 2 months now and shes been doing great with him, until the psycho bitch from hell comes along and decides to give him to the horse guard. Damn did that make me SO mad i wanted to punch Martha's lights out, if their's one thing that really makes me mad it's when people mistreat my friends. So they came and took Jete away today and Mandy is devastated. The other bad thing that happened was Chelsea got bucked off Big Sunny, while I was being locked in the stall with holly and making goo goo eyes at the boy (stupid me, my god i'm a jackass) my best friend gets her ass kicked by an overweight Thoroughbred.... Oh well easy come easy go all in all the good outweighs the bad and like some old proverb says with every ending comes a brand new beginning. So i think i shall end this post, or am i just beginning a new adventure, a new challenge in the next day? You know you love me, Shimby
