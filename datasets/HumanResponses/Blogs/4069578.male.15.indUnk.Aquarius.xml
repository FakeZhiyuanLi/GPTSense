       see i wanna talk to megan and harrison about this crap but i just dont have the courage....i think maybe i'm afraid of gettin in some big even more depressing discussion and i'll end up losing them both....things are already tough as hell on megan...and harrison is just so happy that he gets to hug on megan and be with megan.....i think back to that night when JT confronted me and megan said she couldn't be in a relationship.....i remember saying something like "well i guess this means we cant hold hands anymore..........but can i atleast still hug you?" and megans answer to that question was not no...but yes.......i dont think we ever did hold hands after that...infact i think we got even closer after that.....sure megan i did want to continue becuz i was crazy about you but you didn't really put up a fight.....well i was just IMed by harrison......i told about the blog....this post is the only thing standing in my way from  something ...not sure wut that something is though...meh...i can see it now....everything is gonna end...everybody is gonna hate me......*sigh* i dont want to type anymore.....i'm just gonna publish this damn thing and get it over with.....

       AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGG!!! ;_; for some odd reason i feel really sad right now...i'm not sure why...i just dont want to think anymore....my friend crystal has told me to just forget about megan...but its so hard....when i've been focusing on her and only her for such a long time.....i read harrisons journal thingy and he says its like megan was just waiting for him......WUT THE?! wut the hell am i man?!? just a friggin pawn in yalls little chess game of love from hell (wut a name huh? but its not important x_x)....i've known harrison for a long long time and he's a good guy but to me he seems to be acting like a real bastard and that doesn't make me feel good at all.....i dont want to lose megan or harrison as friends but wut other choice do i got?....i just dont know.....i could try to stay friends with them and be miserable cuz i'm too much of an idiot and an asshole to talk to them about it.....or i could make new friends and hang out with different ppl...that way they wouldn't be on my mind as much.....thomas says i should talk to megan and harrison but crystal says i should just let it go...and i want to talk to shara about it cuz she is a very very wise person and i feel i can talk to her about it.......DAMN!! why wont everything just leave me alone?!?.....i feel so bad......wut did i do to deserve this?? AM I SUPPOSED TO GET USED TO THIS?!?!?!? i suppose i sound like a complete bastard..only thinkin of myself.....but then again i dont know....maybe i'm not being selfish.....harrison has said in his journal that he repects ppl blah blah blah.......if only he knew....during the summer i considered harrison my best friend.....it reminds me of that song where the dude is like "shes my best friends girl and she used to be mine".....wut kind of a friend goes out with his buddy's ex?!? even my guitar teacher had some comments...he was like "hmm well who's your real friend?"....something for me to think about....now i'm thinkin about the thing "wuts harrison got that i dont got???".....well i'm not smart like harrison is.....i really have difficulties putting my emotions into words...but just becuz i have a hard time puttings my emotions into words doesn't mean i dont have emotions.....i think of myself as a really sensitive person....harrison and megan are having some tough stuff with religion....so am i....i believe that there is a god...i would love to say that i have faith like harrison does....but it brings tears to my eyes becuz i cant say that i can....its such a horrible feeling.....my mom is a strong Christian.....as for my dad well he doesn't goto church...i dont know his views on the subject and it makes me feel horrible....and this blog makes me think that all i care about is me, me, me, and me......but thats wrong.....i care for all of my friends.....i dont like to hurt anybody unless they hurt me...and usually i never get payback.......and now i'm just beatin myself up..but i cant help it.....its just so hard....i dont think anybody knows wut i feel like...but that cant be true becuz somebody has to...thats just how it is.....and i dont want to end up like megan with (yes i am quoting this from harrison) "excess emotional baggage" but i just dont know how things are gonna turn out......i dont wanna think anymore....i just dont know......i feel pain and anger...i feel like i'm not good enough...i feel like everybody is gonna end up hating me in the end...i just feel a whole bunch of things...and i dont like it.....i dont like how harrison says "it's MEGAAAAN!!!" over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.....i dont like it....ever since they've been together harrison just seems so full of himself....WELL LET ME TELL YOU....i think megan is gonna leave him out in the cold someday....and i dont think megan is gonna convert into a Christian.......HARRISON! MEGAN! IF YOU TWO ARE READING THIS THEN BLEH!!! if yall are reading this then i would imagine that megan hates my guts now...and i would imagine that harrison isn't too pleased.....i'm gonna stop here...i'll probably think of some more shizz later that i would  want to add to this post but it would be a waste of time....um yeah....

        hmm alrighty then.....this be meh blog thingy.......at first i was just gonna make it so i could show everyone how pissed off i am but i decided that i can put wutever i want here.....wutever i feel like saying.....my feelings.....my actions....goodies of all kinds....you maybe wondering why i am pissed......well i guess i'll tell ya.....i'm pissed of at harrison and megan......seems to me like they both stabbed me in the back......harrison supported megan and i....then he stabbed me in the back..cuz he wants her now....but he said he didn't want her becuz of religious stuff....nah..that aint how it looks to me.....and then there's megan....i really do think she was leading me on for some time...but she denies it...saying that i was the one that wanted to continue....i did want to continue but if she didn't want to continue then i think she should have done a little bit more to try to shake me off.....i think&nbsp;i've got a&nbsp;few questions for her...why didn't you tell me that you wanted to be with harrison? when did you decide that you wanted to be with harrison?......maybe some more...i'll be thinkin about it....i know that you said that it's not about who is better but sometimes i wonder..wut's harrison got that i dont?!?....i dunno.....i'm not depressed about it anymore...just angry.....i can imagine that there are a few things that i'm overlooking but i'm pretty sure that i have put a lot of thought into this stuff.........heh i bet if yall are readin this yall are prolly thinkin somethin like "WHOA! wut an asshole!!" well if thats wut i am then thats wut i am..........y'know normally i dont like to make ppl uncomfortable if i have anything to do about it......but lemme tell ya.....somehow it feels so good to be really really angry after a long time of just not being very mad......i dont want megan as more than a friend anymore....she can have harrison i suppose.....i dont want to lose anybody as a friend..but if they read this i dont know how they is gonna take it......heh even my guitar teacher has given me wise words about this stuff.....heh heh i think this make it sound like i'm weird but i read harrison and megans "online journal" thingies......i read harrisons and i sense fault....familiar feelings too.......i read megans and from the sound of it it seems like megan to me.....she has really&nbsp;strong feelings...i mean like...they're deep....i dunno....i'm not smart like harrison is....sometimes i have trouble saying wuts on my mind......but harrison may be wise but i'm wise too....i'm not an idiot....bleh..........school is starting soon.....i know school is evil but i look at it this way...wut would we do without school?....there's gonna be new ppl at school.....its gonna be awesome...i look forward to it actually...heh i know i'm probably gonna change my view on that when school starts though..........well i think i would post more but my head hurts so i'm gonna go lie down......if anybody wants to talk to me about this stuff (i bet if you read it you will want to talk to me...) then just IM me...its all good....my good my good...not my bad....my good....

       well well um hmm....uhh alright.....i'm thinking that harrison and megan should get away from me.....not becuz of how it would make me feel but it would be one less thing for them to worry about....i dont need to make myself a burden to anybody....i dont know why i hurt like this anymore.....i shouldn't be hurting at all anymore....i thought everything was resolved....i thought things were gonna be good again.....but then somehow it just goes bleh....dunno why...but it did.....it just confuses me.....why cant i let it go?!? I DONT KNOW.....i just dont know....i wanna let it go but i get those feelings again.......i think kevin is right......i just need to find some i like.....it would take my mind off of everything and i think it would bring me back to normal....but i'm not gonna let the same thing happen again....i've gotta watch myself....take care of my balls.....i have taken a break from typin this thing and during that break i was thinkin "alrighty wut i gotsta do is just put this stuff behind me.....even if it means i've gotta be a cold-hearted bitch for a while" and i dont think i'm gonna be one but myeh....just gotta put it behind me.....just gotta get over it.....i think it just needs to be BAM! i'm over it.....not a gradual thing....cuz gradual things take it in the tube.....heh heh tube......anus tube......nasty......how did i end up talkin about anus tubes? oh well i think it would be a good idea if i didn't see harrison and megan for a while.....doesn't mean i dont wanna hang out with them anymore (well it kinda does but not for forever....just until i'm feeling better about this or somethin) bleh.....la la la la la la la la......gosh its been such a long time since i've listened to led zeppelin.....its been such a long time since i've really listened to music......everything needs to get better.....i've gotta make things better......gonna meet lots of new ppl at school....gonna be awesome.....EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE GOOD I SAY!!......i cant really think of anything else i wanna say right now O_o bleh....bleh.....BLEH.....um ok i'm done with this post......

GOD IN HEAVEN WUT DID I DO TO DESERVE ALL THIS??? i guess He's just generous.....he is almighty y'know....i believe in him....i'm just havin troubles.....and now mom is purposely invading my HUGE personal bubble i have here....why cant she fold those friggin clothes somewhere else......i dont like it......i wish there was a way to just instantly make it all better.....but there isn't....and this sux.....she gettin all crazee on my butt becuz i dont drive like she does.....ITS NOT LIKE I GET TO DRIVE EVERYDAY LIKE YOU....even if you dont want to.....oh man my head hurts.....i'm gonna go lie down....

       eh..several ppl seem very not happy....but i dont think there's anything  i  can do for them...humans are humans..and humans will act like humans...humans are very ignorant but that's just how it is....there may be nothing after death and there may be a god.....i believe there is a god...but i also respect the possibility of nothing after death.....if there is a god then i want to be tight with him...and if there isn't a god and theres like nothing but darkness after death then so be it....there's nothing i can do about it....it's beyond my abilities to try to change something like that....but say after death we all go into some sort of funky realm like dealy and we're all spirits or somethin...well if thats how it is then thats how it is....this is a big world and i doubt that i'm the only person that feels like i do.....if somebody goes out of this world as i do i can imagine there will be atleast one other person that goes the same way as me and after all i'll be a ghost..i'll just find em or somethin like that or do wutever it is that ghosts do....but suppose there wasn't a person like me in there....well then i'll probably get lonely and feel bad and stuff...i'm dead though..things would suck already cuz i'm dead...i dont wanna talk about that kinda stuff anymore....humans suck...humans have always sucked...humans will forever suck....finding another human that you can love is extremely hard.....i myself dont know exactly wut love is...i know that there is a feeling that you can get for somebody but is that love? i'm only 15..i dont know everything there is to know......ppl get all angry and stuff becuz ppl dont use the word love correctly by their terms....example: BILLYBOB I LOVE YOU!!!....i'm not gay....i used that as a joke....A JOKE....but love is not a joke....oh well....i dont know any better.....if nobody tells me wut love exactly then how will i know if i'm in love?....i suppose you just know if you're in love...i've had deep feelings for someone before but i dont know if it was love exactly...it felt like it could have been love....maybe it was love....i dont know....know i feel as though i could be saying somethin against myself somehow and i'm not catching it....wutever...dont listen to me then....infact nobody has to read any of this if they dont want to....but this is MY place and i can put wutever i feel in here and i shouldn't hafta feel bad about it....whether i like it or not i bet there will be some negative thoughts and what not against my posts but everything sucks and then you die....i'm gonna stop becuz i feel like stopping here....

       alright folks i have read megans recent posts on her journal and i read the comments she left on my blog and i must say that i am furious...infact furious is just a fraction of the anger i have....i'm not sure where to start...umm alright i'll just go on....ok i do not live according to megans terms...if i say i was heartbroken then i was friggin heartbroken..i dont care if  you  say i'm wrong becuz i know that  you  are the person that is wrong....alright maybe i wasn't in love according to megan but i felt somethin i had never felt before so i said it was love and that's all there is to it....ok so i dont know anything about megan BUT she doesn't know anything about me.....maybe i do live in my own little world but since when did megan become so perfect....i admit it..i dont have a problem at all with things going the way i want em..i think everybody is that way....but i dont get anal about things if they arent going exactly the way i plan...i dont like it and i prolly act negative about it though but i see acting negatively about things i dont like as normal.....yes i am immature but for some odd reason i believe that megan is also a lil bit immature.....and i have lots of friends....ppl do wanna be around me and if you dont want to be one of those ppl then thats fine....i'm not perfect and neither are you...if you dont wanna be friends with me anymore megan well guess what...i feel the same way about you......oh yeah...harrison is probably the best friend i've ever had and i hope he'll never get hurt again....i hope megan treats him the best she can becuz i know harrison loves megan....umm i've said wut i feel like saying right now and i doubt i will respond if megan says anything about my post here.....goodbye
