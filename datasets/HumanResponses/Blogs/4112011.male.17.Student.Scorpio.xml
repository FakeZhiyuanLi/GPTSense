      Another day to bust my ass with all this stuff that i have to face. I dont know which is worst the people i have to get a long with or the work i have to work with. LIfe.. is this what it is all about?! oh well.. not much i could do right? Lucky for me i have a jeijei who i know would be by my side... Last night was scary. I practically cried the whole night thinking that i've lost jeijei.. that was really scary. i dont want anything like that to happen. Hayyyyy....  who's new.. tina... and there's rus... pero like the rest they're expected to go away. i dotn care. i have jei jei naman eh.:)   Teth is now with sportz.. hahah.. i have no idea who she is... sportz is pretty good looking. never really loved teth anyway.. wel i thought i did. pero mostly it was just about lust and wanting to OWN someone. hmm.. so didnt suffer that much from that.. expect of course for finacial ouches! ahahaha...  Im in the library. i like writing my journal here. Its quiet here noone can bother u. no one... except for your own self. is that another somebody bah? maybe..

      A girl with too many thoughts to handle. This statement perfectly describe where I am right now. I have a special person in my heart who I know I can't have. But, who knows... Just like my ex said.. only time will tell.   Destiny? Anyone reading this believe in that? I do... Somehow I know that we have all our given destiny...  Will I be able to die in the arms of the person I love? Will I wake up 20 years from now in the arms of that person?...  So many questions that I am dieng to find out...  Pero still have the patients to see what's going to happen next.   Have I finally found the one? I'm not in a hurry. I'm willing to learn another heart ache it that is what it takes for me to be the perfect person for the One.  *sigh* No, I'm not sad. Just that so many thoughts are in my mind and my head is still hung up. I like the way things are right now. Except for the fact with people who are after my ass. Pero most of it I am really happy with. I know I have a friend who I could have and hold forever... Forever...  does that ever exsist. I wonder so many times jud.

      I didn't make my homework. well this homework happens to be my preliminary exam. I think it's shit how i messed it up this time. I'll make it tonight. How could I be so stupid. I can't believe I wasn't able to write it.  I wonder... Will i ever change. will i ever be the kind of person that i should be? who is that person....  I'm drifting away from myself. or maybe going towards myself more. either i think its bad... i dont have that many thoughts today. im depressed... urgh!

      hmmmmmm...... i have no idea why i like this things..pero journals.. i never seem to get tired of writing them. i even still have my livejournal. it stil works.. my poems.. poems that were writtten by people who said they'd stay forever are still there. now theres just one person who promised me forever. though she doesnt giveme what i want pero she seems so determined for being with me. im not sure if its a good thing or a bad thing. pero it makes me secure to have her around my life. i feel like i can confide in her. and its good. i htink. shes everythng i ever asked for.. pero she doesnt give me...*basta!*  I AM SUCH A PATHETIC PERSON. pero somehow some people are just drawn to me. which good i think. other wise id be  a lone. i wouldnt like that. hayyyyy.. another one of my gloomy days.. pero i like it. it squesez me and makes me write and think about everything.   everything. what is that. do i even have something? ??? no i dtn. i know im nothng.. pero stil i know i exist. its weird how things can be. its good though that you have a choice. choices.. do they make u someting. once i said choices makes u like God. gives u the power to have your own destiny.. pero someone said it doesnt. i forgot what she said though.  who were my real friends nga? i forgot. ahh.. right now i can only think of one. JANET JACOB....  hmm..  teth.. i dont know. i gues im just so selfish.. i like the thought of owning her and i guess thats just the only reason why i am ever sticking to her. am i sticking or am i just given the title..  *sigh* fuck! i hate life so much. what made me like htis? hate life so much? what made me such a miserable person when i was so ok before. was it the freedom? pero i haad freedom before. was it all the pain.. ive had that before what difference does it make. im suppose to learn good stuff diba.? pero how come its just so natural for me to go to the other side.?  guess thats what makes me so human. shit!  i hate being human. i hate living. i hate breathing every god damn morning! cant i be the kid who dies of cancer? cant i be some one else? cant i be the pretty girl who has everything she ever ask for? can i have a good set of paretns? of friends? of lovers?   cant i live somewhere else? manila? europe? i wana get marriend in rome someday.. that would be good right?  im having a head ache.. i wonder if what im writing is long enough. hmm.. im going to make a rule.. next entry i have to have the proper capitalizations and spelling.   i have to go.
