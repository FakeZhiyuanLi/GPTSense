       My new life in Florida has been pleasant. Not exactly what i've been expecting, but none the less enjoyable. I came from Michigan being a very social girl, with many wonderful friends, from many different "groups", to a Floridian who doesn't have a social life at all. Its such a big change. In Michigan i really treasured "alexis time", and really enjoyed the time where i could just lay back and think, daydream... whatever... but now in Florida thats all i have been doing.  But during this time i've reflected back on my high school experiences; my many different leaps from one group of friends to another, to my first love, and the love after that, and the love after that....       Sometimes i love it , but other times i hate it here. So many times, i wish i was back at Michigan. Back to my friends, my dad, Suz, John...everything. I wouldn't even mind going back to high school, because of the security i had with everything surrouding me at that point in my life. Its scary, but i have my Mom here with me who will do anything for me, Joey who i know will always be there to love me, and Amanda who will always be my friend. I have met some people here, but i really just dont see the point in getting into a relationship with them, because the friendships really wouldn't have anywhere to go. Just because they are also going back to school, and i'm going to LA soon... but maybe thats just an excuse i'm using for not having a social life here.       But i had a little taste of my friends when Korie, Bethany, and Janene came down to visit me last week. God that was so much fun. We all bonded so much, and i love those girls so much. We went to Islands of Adventure, Cocoa Beach, Mall of Millenia, and we watched endless hours of 'Sex and the City'. Its so fun watching that show with them, because we've all found we have something in common with each one of the characters on that show. Of course that whole show is based on sex, but even more then that, we find we have a very similar type of friendship that the 4 women have on that show.  I was very sad to see them go, but i know i'll be seeing them soon enough. I'm horrible with goodbyes, but i know they will all be there for me no matter what, and that makes the distance easier to handle.       I also went to New Jersey with John and his family. That was such a fun/relaxing vacation. I enjoyed myself so much. We stayed at this house right on the ocean. I loved being able to wake up, step outside, and to hear and smell the ocean. It was so beautiful. I miss that vacation already. Most of all because i got to spend a week with John. I love watching our relationship grow. We have learned so much about each other in the past 9 months, and it excites me knowing we have all the time in the world to learn more. I cant wait until i get to see him again. I really miss him a lot, and its hard almost every single day, but he's worth that hardship. Our relationship is worth the waiting we have to do.         But now i'm getting ready for my big trip to LA. The countless hours of practicing songs, reading over contracts, then re-reading them all over again, shopping, trying to find a "perfect look", and so much more. I am so excited about this opportunity, but at the same time, i'm so terrified. I have many doubts, but this is what i've wanted for more then i can remember, and it seems only right for me to do this. Now i have to compete against 7 other girls my age. I'm sure these girls are extremely talented, beautiful, and driven, but i feel like i just have to be myself, and give all i can give, and hopefully people will love that above everything else.
