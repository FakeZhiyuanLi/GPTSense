      Welcome to the Underwood Motel blog! My name is Danielle, but this is not my story this is the story of the homeless men, women, and children I have met, each story is as different as the person that told me. But before I get to the interesting part, I’ll tell you a little bit about me, just so you have some perspective. I’m 24 and I was introduced to “homelessness” pretty much because I got a job working on a documentary on this subject. I grew up pretty high in the socio-economic spectrum. I was always taught that you had to work hard, that you had to accomplish your goals, and that you had to be the best that you could be. When I made a mistake, I was always punished, but then I was hugged and told that I was loved. In short, I’m lucky, I couldn’t have asked for a better upbringing. But, at the same time, I was sheltered. I grew up thinking that anyone that worked hard could accomplish their goals. And when I saw a homeless person on the corner, sure I felt bad for them and I would give them a couple bucks. But, I always kind of thought that they chose their lifestyle, either because they didn’t want to do anything except get high, or they were crazy. In other words, I was stereo-typing, something that I despise, so to right my wrong I want to share each person’s story with you. So that next time you see someone holding a cardboard sign you won’t see a “bum on the corner”, you’ll see an individual with a story.   As part of the research for this documentary, I have interviewed many homeless men, women, and children; and many people that have dedicated their lives to helping those in need. Periodically I will share these incredible individual’s stories so that you can meet the people that have changed my life. What you take away from these stories is completely up to you, but I promise if you read each story with an open mind you will never see a “bum” the same way.

      So, today was the first day of my person-to-person research in the field. I went to Catholic Charities and handed out clothes to the homeless. I decided to do this because I thought that it would be a good way to meet and form connections with the potential stars of this film. I was expecting this to be relatively easy. I would hand out clothes, meet a few people, and start to get to know them so that in the future they would be comfortable and more willing to open up to me.     Yeah, well I had a rather rough awakening. I've met many homeless people that were in a program and on their way to being re-acclimated into "society", I've spent time in shelters, and I've seen what it is like under the boardwalk. But, none of that prepared me for what I experienced today. The individuals that came in for clothes, came in pretty much right after spending a night at the underwood motel. Many of them were older, sun ravaged, they reeked of alcohol and other unpleasant scents, there were many missing teeth, unbrushed hair, and out of control beards. But these weren't the individuals that got to me. As wrong as this is, they were who I was expecting to need clothes.      But there were definitely some clients that caught me off guard. There was one person in particular that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. When he came into the store he seemed more desperate and embarrassed, than any of the other clients. He rushed in and asked the first person he saw, Ellen the woman I was working with, for a shirt. At the time I was filling out paper work. I inadvertently glanced up, and what I saw will be permanently burned into my memory. It was so sad, so beautiful, yet utterly filthy. I saw this innocent looking young guy with no shirt. He had nothing, but the shorts he was wearing and a pair of worn tennis shoes. He was covered from head to toe with sand and dirt. He seemed to be in his early twenties, he was well spoken, very polite, he had an air of kindness about him, he had deep brown eyes, and a beautiful honest smile. He appeared to be healthy, his teeth were perfect, his eyes were clear, and he had a healthy build. While he was looking for clothes his sense of humor and intelligence began to peek through his wall of need. He found a couple of things. Then, as quickly as he came in, he left.      I wanted so badly to talk to him and find out what happened to him and how he ended up living under the boardwalk, but it wasn't the time or place. I couldn't understand how someone so polite, and so appreciative could be forced to live in dirt, hidden under a world of entertainment and indulgence.     I can only hope that either his situation today was a fluke, or that I will get to talk to him and find out what happened to him.

      What is the Underwood Motel? Well, if you can’t tell by the picture, it is not what you would expect a conventional motel to be. Every room is guaranteed an ocean view, yet it costs nothing to stay at. The catch is, once you’re there you’ve lost everything. The Underwood Motel refers to living hidden beneath the boardwalk of Atlantic City, NJ, A.K.A. being homeless.

      Imagine being nine years old again and playing with your little sister or brother. That’s pretty easy, right? Well, now imagine going downstairs to ask your mom a question, but instead you see that she is smoking crack cocaine. That’s a little more difficult to do, don’t you think? What would you do, run back upstairs, scared? I know that I would. But, wait; now imagine being back upstairs and then hearing a sudden bang. You run to the stairs and you see that your mom is getting raped and beaten? Can you even imagine this? Because, this is far beyond my comprehension.  Meet Russell and Allison, this is just the beginning of their story. Russell is now thirteen years old and Allison is twelve. When I first met them and started interviewing them I gave them a little direction, and then let them interview each other while I stood back and taped it. While this was going on Allison asked Russell about this event and he told the story. Then she asked him how he felt while this was happening, he said scared and mad. At this point I was surprised that Allison had taken the interview this far, and I was expecting her to move on to another line of questions, but she didn’t. She asked Russell why he didn’t do anything to help their mother. This question shocked me. I mean the answer seemed so obvious. He was a nine year old little boy, what could he possibly have done? But to Russell and Allison, the answer wasn’t so simple. At first, all Russell said was that he was scared and that he didn’t want to get beat up. Then Allison asked Russell why he didn’t call the cops. Russell said his mom brought this man into the house and that he didn’t want to get taken away by the state.  After that was said I stood watching these two young kids in a state of utter disbelief, this whole situation shocked me for a number of reasons. First, why should a child have to face this sort of reasoning? And, second, what do you say to two kids that have seen something you can’t even comprehend? Do you tell them that this shouldn’t have happened, when clearly it did? Do you tell them that the whole world isn’t like that? Or, do you listen, and try to show them an honest unforced sense of love?  Unfortunately, like I said, this is only the beginning of their sad story. The rest is to come…
