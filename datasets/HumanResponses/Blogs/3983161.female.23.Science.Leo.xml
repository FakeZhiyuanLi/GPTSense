						   Gue pikir kita hidup untuk mencari kebenaran absolut, walaupun mungkin cuma beberapa kepala yang mau pusing soal beginian. Gue cuma kasian sama orang2 yang menganggap bahwa kebenaran absolut itu terletak pada Tuhan melalui agama2 yang ada. Ngga seru lagi dong... Makanya gue mau pusing, biar hidup gue jadi seru.  Gampang memang untuk berpikir bahwa segala sesuatu itu relatif.. atau kebenaran itu sesuatu yang subyektif.. Dan gue rasa ini juga sesuatu yang bisa membebaskan pikiran seseorang dari religiusitas atau doktrinasi lain yang membuat otak kita lumpuh. TAPI... cukup sampai di situ aja manfaatnya, dan setelah itu, kita harus beranjak, menapaki jalur2 'kebenaran', mencari what the truth is... Ngga usah ketemu, dan sepertinya ngga mungkin ketemu, dan paling ujung2nya mentok sama determinisme alam.. But we have to face the truth, kan? There's no easy way to learn, and we have to learn.  Ini bukan berarti gue menyarankan orang2 untuk berhenti dari usahanya dalam memperindah hidup, karena sekalinya kita berhadapan dengan determinisme, ngga ada kata lain yang lebih mewakili respon orang2 selain: depresi. Anti-depresan ngga murah, man..

      Edge  [Sylvia Plath]  The woman is perfected. Her dead  Body wears the smile of accomplishment, The illusion of  a Greek  necessity  Flows in the scrolls of her toga, Her bare  Feet seem to be saying: We have come so far, it is over.  Each dead child coiled, a white serpent, One at each little  Pitcher of milk, now empty. She has folded  Them back into her body as petals Of a rose close when the garden  Stiffens and odors bleed From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.  The moon has nothing to be sad about, Staring from her hood of bone.  She is used to this sort of thing. Her blacks crackle and drag.

      Yellow wrote: It was the beginning of March. I remember the day that started it all. It was almost like a dream.. A kind of scene with a sepia background in some old movie, near the bay in the late afternoon. The benches were empty, except for one of them. There, he waited for me, with a philosophy text book opened on his folded knees and a pencil slipped above his ear. He saw me walking down from the east. It was so quiet that you could almost hear the wind whispering some words.  He hadn't shaved, I could see stubble on the surface of his chin up to his cheeks. His hair was a little bit messy, curly-brownish hair with some sweat on them. I could see his blue eyes and his long eye-lashes. I think they were beautiful. He looked a little bit shy.  "Hey," said he.  "Hi," I answered.  It was 4.30 pm. I knew he was supposed to be in class at 4.20.  "You have that Goethe class, right?" He shrugged. "Yeah. I just don't feel like coming in on time." He paused for a while, then hesitantly continued his sentences. "Err, I'm just wondering. Do you have anything to do tomorrow after class..." And my world changed ever since.  ***  Creature asked: "I have something to tell you. I don't know what it is. Wish I had something to offer. Other than you think you see. I can't just be. Must always ask. But I don't want to question you. Your happiness seems perfect. Don't want to alter that. Can you bring me to it?"  Yellow answered: "You are free to question me. You are free to tell. You must ask, I agree. It is alright to dwell. I don't need an offer. I buy what I see. You should not even bother. This is what I feel, let it be! Happiness is not to be brought. Nor just a simple thought. The happy person you see in me; is merely a reflection of thee."  ***  Did they live happily ever after? No. But they compromised to minimize the pain. And they became good friends.   The End.

      [From "Her Kind", Anne Sexton]  ... I have ridden in your cart, driver, waved my nude arms at villages going by, learning the last bright routes, survivor where your flames still bite my thigh and my ribs crack where your wheels wind. A woman like that is not ashamed to die. I have been her kind.  P.S. In the complete version, she uses some magical metaphors. I like this kind of usage of this kind of imagination. It's her kind.

      I have this question in mind: Is imagination supposed to be unreal?  Gue suka sebel kalo orang mendikotomikan realitas-imajinasi ke dalam Daily Life - LOTR. So if you're bored with your life and deciding to plunge yourself into the imaginary world... you have to start playing Dungeons & Dragons, and you have to adore Tolkien, of course. But if you think that your life sucks and you start having these illusions such as creating your own imaginary world that is not so detached from your daily life, then you're insane.   Fuck that.   Hey, people have this illusion about God all the time, and they are not considered crazy. When you say that God is talking to you, then you're a prophet. But if you say that, "Hey, you see that man over there? He's my best friend" [pointing to an empty spot on the bench], then you're schizophrenic.   So where's the limit? Ask that to a psychologist.  That, if they have a sense of objectivity. [I'm surprised that a friend of mine who is a psychologist does not even admit the concept of objectivity].   But what I'm trying to say here is...  First of all, I know I'm not better than those people who have this imaginary world of Elves, Dragons and Goblins. And I'm not saying that I'm against it. But I do have a critique for them. Why must we go away that far from the real life just to have an illusion? [Some people even argue that, "It's healthy," Haha!]. You know, these people usually... they say, "I'm not religious.. but I do believe that your soul will be saved if you control your energy." Yeah right.  It's their choice, of course. But some of their manners just bother me a lot.  "Uuuhh.. I have my own world to escape from the cruelty of life.. And I am aware that it's just an imagination."  I think they're just [s]elfish.   In other words, I think they are - like me - trying to decorate life a lit'l bit. They try to console their loneliness with this illusion... err.. imagination of Tolkien's kinda thing; that there are beautiful creatures called the Elves [Legolas oh Legolas], that there are actually creatures who have good hearts called the Hobbits, or powerful creatures like Wizards... And the ugly, evil, slave-like ones? Oh, they are all created by the Evil spirit.  But do they really keep this imagination apart from reality? From their personality? From their ways of dealing with life?  I don't think so. At some point, I think they've abandoned life.

      July 25th 2004: 113 pounds, 165 cm, cokelat [gara-gara naik sepeda 3-4 kali seminggu @ 11 miles, atawa jalan kaki panas-panas], berotot [gara-gara kedua hal itu juga, dan karena gue kerja di fitness center, jadi bebas pake mesin2 yang ada..], agak2 bipolar, impulsif abis, agak2 autis, and I don't like new-age kinda thing. Sepertinya kepribadian gue perlu dianalisis, kalo di kontinum abnormal-normal, gue di sebelah mana, cenderung ke kiri atau ke kanan?  Belakangan agak depresi, tapi seperti yang udah gue bilang.. manic-depresive. Kalau depresinya lagi kambuh... gue ngapain ya? Bersih-bersih dapur, nyiram tanaman roommate gue yang ga pernah pulang, masak, eating 2 pounds of black-grapes dalam tempo setengah jam.  Kenapa depresi? Ngga tau. Cakrawala gue terbuka lebih lebar lagi, tapi kali ini menyangkut sisi-sisi depresif hidup, gue beranjak menjadi semakin tidak spiritual in any sense.. haha. And I don't really have many friends here especially in summer. Jadi terjebak lah gue...   I have a new job as an autistic child's tutor. Melihat his lacking of attention span.. gue jadi mikir.. wong gue juga begitu kok malah ngajarin dia... But he's a really sweet boy, very smart inside.  Eli has been a great help lately.. I am lucky that he's around.   What else? Not much. I think I need a lot of food and exercise.
