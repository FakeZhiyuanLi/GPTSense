      As usual, I woke up at 7am, prepare myself and go off for school.. Last night I guess I din sleep well, cause is like I have to change back my body clock u see so i wake up quite a few times in the middle of the night then went back to sleep again. Actually I woke up at about 5.30am in the morning but is too early so i went back to sleep for another 1h 30mins. While I was walking to the Jurong East MRT station, I was like thinking DIE today is culture & Communication module, will it be hard? Beckham misses 2 penalties in EURO2004, I gonna lots of nonsense from my friends. My class know I am a Beckham fan cause I wore my Manchester United NO.7 Beckham jersey to school sometimes and my wallpapers are usually Beckham But they had never seen me wear my REAL MADRID NO.23 Beckham jersey and maybe somedays I should wear. True enough, when I step INTO my class, I'm Surrounded with Nonsense HElp!!.. LOL.. Beckham-ed it, Beckham misses penalty and stuff like that surrounded and I have nothing to say so I say "Don Blame Him, his times is over and pioneers should take over". I blamed on the pitch also. After that we carry out with the discussion on EURO 2004 then I was like saying "FCUK rite ?" when the class suddenly quiet down. LOL.. then everyone laughed at me then I looked at the facilitator but she never say a word so I hehe what to do ? HECK CARE LOR.. Unexpectedly, Culture & communication module for today is quite easy, we don have to research much and is just talking about how to be a good speaker. The whole class was slacking, talking and chatting with one another, some surfing the net and stuff. One of my classmates announced SCIENCE UT RESULTS are out CHECK IT NOW.. Everyone was like "DIE SURE FAIL". Suddenly YAY!! I GOT A !! some CB KNN I GOT D+.. I myself got an A and very very happy cause I din expect a A instead I thought I will get a C or something.. My predicted Grade for the module is A as well.. OMG I REALLY LOVE SCIENCE.. I only 1 B so far for my Science and the rest are A's.. HEHE.. I think i shall not be complacent.. Continue to work hard for my other modules and my SUCCESS will come eventually.. GOoD Luck to myself. Tml I will be having Visual Basic UT, I Hope for a B for that. TN0203A Rocks !! LIVELY CLASS, FACILITATORs Enjoy Teaching US !!

        Determined Becks  Beckham is my idol since he came into Manchester United.. His style of playing and crossing really impressed me although nowadays his skills is not as impressive as before and deteriorating.. Nowadays I may not idolize him as much as before BUT after reading the news posted at Beckham Magazine makes him idolize him even more.. He is such a strong person.. People may write him off, criticise him and such but he has his own reasons which other people and fans do not understand..   Beckham said: "If they want to write me off I'll just keep coming back and back until I've won." "The intrusion and the invasion into my life is tough because I've got children and I want them to enjoy their lives but people will just say 'why's he complaining?'.   "I'm not complaining but of course it's tough. It's tough on any family.    I guess he is still not adapting well enough to the way of life in spain, he said that It's full of four and five cars following me every day everywhere I go, to the park with my children" At Least in Manchester, he is able to go to the trafford centre and walk around with his family. In Spain is different story, he cant even step out of his front door.. He is willing to take critiscism BUT at the end of the day he will fight back..  His determination impressed me dude ! He is losing, he admitted and made no excuses but in the end he will fight it back.. He playing two important roles, 1st is to maintain his reputation in soccer and 2nd take care of his family.. WELL DONE BECKHAM ! KEEP IT UP.. EVERYONE DO MAKE MISTAKES, NO ONE IS PERFECT.. IT DEPENDS ON ONESELF TO BE STRONG AND STAND UP ONCE AGAIN.. DETERMINATION SPEAKS THE LOUDEST.. =)    Stop All Becks Stuff, Verdict = Beckham Is My Idol & Forever My Idol..     NO.7 David Beckham (ENGLAND RULEZZZ)  Today I went west coast with some of my friends; Keith, Yanxiang, Yaoxing and Waijun.. Yaoxing brought his doggie there too (Mocha).. We also had a great TCS there.. TCS = Talk cock Session.. We threw the bone and mocha picked it up and brought it back.. FUN~ but he so lan lan type after a few runs.. Just lie down on the grass and rest.. Mocha saw one other dog and he ran towards the dog.. YAoxing like so stressed up type.. LOL.. the other dog named ROMEO!! Hehe.. Mocha Found a NEW friend.. After that we talk talk talk........ Keith said he HUNGRY liao then we head to the mac and have our lunch and WENT HOME.. TIRED when i reached home.. Tml school starting no more life, WORK WORK AND WORK.. STRESS, STRESS and STILL STRESS.. Best Of Luck to myself as well, must be like beckham DETERMINED TO DO ANYTHING I WANT..

      Oh my god, this match is just like a repeated match of Portugal -vs- England. Both teams end up deciding who will go in the semi-finals by PENALTY.. The winning team will be facing the HOST(Portugal) in the semi-finals.. Another great match I should say, either being saved by the goalkeepers or shoot it wide.. Netherlands being the luckier ones won the penalties shootout over Sweden with the score of Sweden 4 - 5 Netherlands.. Let me review on the penalties shootouts.   Penalty takers for Netherlands - Ruud van Nistelrooy, Johnny Heitinga, Michael Reiziger, Philip Cocu, Roy Makaay, Arjen Robben. Captain of Netherlands Philip Cocu misses his penalty.  Penalty takers for Sweden -  Kim Kallstrom, Henrik Larsson, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Fredrik Ljungberg, Christian Wilhelmsson, Olof Mellberg. Sweden's Forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic misses his penalty, his mistake is being recovered by Netherlands Cocu. However, Netherlands Goalkeeper STUNNED Sweden by saving the penalty taken by Olof Mellberg.  Full time Score - Sweden 0 - 0 Netherlands (Netherlands Win 5 - 4 on Penalties)  My Favourite Netherlands Players    NO.19 Arjen Robben   NO.10 Ruud Van Nistelrooy   NO.11 Rafael Van Der Vaart  **All Rights Reserved - Brooklyn** Proudly Present To You By Brooklyn-

      Euro 2004 Updates..  [26/6/2004] FT France 0 - 1 Greece   I watched this match but is only the second half.. Greece being the underdogs defeat France with a assist from Theo Zagorakis and a powerful header from Angelos Charisteas which brought them into the semi-finals, leaving the french behind. If You guys watching the next Greece's match take note of Zagorakis, he is one who has the potential to play in premier league.. I am sure after this Euro 2004, premier league clubs will be scouting for players in Greece.  Below are some of the pictures I've got..    This is the header from Angelos Charisteas which give French's bathez no chance to save the ball.. GREAT !!    Celebration After The GOAL..    Team Greece running towards their fans after the final whistle.. Final Score France 0 - 1 Greece. Underdogs Rules Euro 2004..  Now England accompanied by France, Back to their Homelands. "Let's go" England : "We are resting for Premier League"  **All Rights Reserved - Brooklyn** Proudly Present To You By Brooklyn-

      Ok I have review some information from soccernet.  LineUps for Portugal : Ricardo; Andrade; Miguel; Valente; Carvalho; Costinha; Deco; Figo; Maniche; Gomes; Ronaldo  LineUps For England : James; Campbell; Cole; Neville; Terry; Beckham; Gerrard; Lampard; Scholes; Owen; Rooney  Both teams have potential to win this match. Portugal has the famous youngster to start Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo has done a great in all three matches. He scored a 90min goal against Greece. Seems Threathening ya? Miguel Nuno Gomes being the super sub for portugal during the match against spain. He was being sub-in during the 45mins and he sinks spain with a single strike during the 50min. Deco played well as well. Figo doesnt seems threathening enough as his actions clearly shows.  As for England, Beckham the instrument, Rooney the MAN.. Gerrard, Lampard, Scholes Did Great in whole the matches except I guess the first match against france they lose 2-1 maybe due to some miscommunications and mistakes made by some of the players. England just did well but not up to my expectations. Ya That's about all. Afterall I prefer England. =)  After the match I will continue to update so no worries about the Results..  Let's Watch It  All The Best !!  **All Rights Reserved - Brooklyn** Proudly Present To You By Brooklyn-

      Guess what time is it now ? LOL it is 6am++ and i still have the energy to write this blog.. Ok stop all my nonsense and get on with the LATEST Euro Update for the day. Firstly I gonna say that Netherlands had done a GREAT job, they beat Latvia 3-0 with Ruud Van Nistelrooy double strike and a Great Goal by Makaay. The other match, regret to announce that the Germans are being beaten by the Reserves of Czechs. It is 2-1 to the Czechs. Czech Republic is the first team achieving 9 pts for all three matches. It rather disappointing to see the Germans packing their bags now BUT I am Happy !! Contradicting.. Hehe.. I am Proud of Netherlands But I doubt they will qualify in the semi-finals because now they are facing the stronger teams. Wish them luck. So today is the 24th of June which is also the First match of Quarter Finals..  [25/6]Portugal -vs- England [02:45]  Hope England will Beat Portugal and Do Me Proud !! (England Fan) Tips For the Day = 2-1 to England..  It's time for me to sleep and I'll be back with more updates Bye bye..   **All Rights Reserved - Brooklyn** Proudly Present To You By Brooklyn-

      Ok.. I will talk about Euro2004 updates first. Until now England, France, Greece, Portugal, Sweden and Denmark have qualify into the quarter finals. Today Group D is having their last game and there is a tough challenge between Germany and Netherlands. Germany is taking on the czechs who have already qualify in the quarter finals. Netherlands is taking on a weaker team (Latvia). If Germany win, they will auto be qualified in the quarter finals BUT If Netherlands win over Latvia and Germany LOSE, then the Germans can pack their stuffs and return to their homeland. LOL.. Both teams have the potential to qualify and let's see who are the luckier ones.   [24/6] Germany -vs- Czech Republic & Netherlands -vs- Latvia [02:45]  **Take Note** All the timings is in 24hours mode.               **All Rights Reserved - Brooklyn** Proudly Present To You By Brooklyn-

      These few days i have not been updating my blog because I am very very very tired when I reached home.. There are things that happening in my life although I look like those happy-go-lucky person but things sometimes cant be avoided anyway. Not everyone will know that I have problems cause I wont show on my face. Sometimes I just feel that I screwed up everything in my life and I just regret doing everything. Borned-Loser I guess, No choice my fate is this and I cant change it.. My breasted-friends please dun blame me for not sharing my problems is just that I dun wish to let u guys see the other side of me.. My job is make you guys happy and i try to forgot about my problems.. Problems are really popping out 1 by 1 and I very sick of them. I need some space to breathe. I guess no one will understand what I am trying to do.. It's ok.. I will be in mystery..   **Sadded** Brooklyn- a.k.a Born-ed Loser..

      Today I went to Spiderman 2 with my friends. It's the best movie ever man. If you were to ask me "Once more?" NO PROBLEM.. We watched it after school. We went to Golden village at Jurong Point, we got tickets for 2035 show. Before that we went to mac and relax ourselves. 2hrs before the show we got our tickets and guess what ? It's 3rd row from the front, selling fast dude.. I played Winning Eleven 7 at mac while waiting anxiously for the time to pass and I can watch my hero.. Sounds like a kid.. LOL..  I watched Spiderman 1 for two times. I am kinda attracted to it. "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, Who Am I ?? I'm Spiderman !" "Focus On What You Want!" Hehe.. Too bad Peter Parker cant be together with M.J because if something were to happen to her, Peter wont never forgive himself. "You are nothing but an empty sit" LOL those watched will know what I am saying.   "Harry, now it's your turn to help me."  "Revenge for your dad" "But he is my Best Friend" "REVENGE FOR ME" "NO!!"  Will Harry revenge for his dad? Let's look forward to the next movie Spiderman 3 (Green/yellow Goblin). GREECE have won the EURO2004 as I have expected. Theodoros Zagorakis & Angelos Charisteas did Greece proud. Cristiano Ronaldo is great but is depends on teamwork to win over the other. Too Bad.. I don't know if tml I want to go for my ALC training.. Very Tired.. Ok I will end here.. Bye Bye Good niteyyy!!

      I am back from the first day of school. Hehe! I neglect my blog for 2 days already and there are many things that happen during these two days, For example ; The Mass black out in singapore + My first training for ALC and also the first training after 8 - 9 months of slacking. First is the black out ; It is around 10+ in the night and I was using my laptop in my study room. I was chatting with some of the Manchester United Fans in #ManchesterUnited. Suddenly "BLACK OUT", I really cant see a single thing, slowly i regain my vision and I get up from my sit. My brother was like talking on the phone before the black out then he came out of our bedroom "eh.. yi black out go get candles.." He lighted up a few candles and I used my light stick, is green colour somemore then made my house look kinda like a ghost house. I was waiting in front of my laptop i thought i was gonna disconnect but it didnt so i continue to play and chat with my friends. I think if I carry on I guess it would be boring so i give my last sentence. My scenary was BEST man.. 21st floor facing the north man.. That was kinda kill cool u see, this whole jurong is DARK.. Once in a life time experience. Wai jun did i TEMPT u ? LOL..   Next was the ALC training yesterday, at first i was kinda like reluctant to attend the training but in the end I forced myself to go. I get to know a lot of my ALC mates and went on with our training but today is the first day of ALC MASS training so the adviser Give Chance.. It's kinda tough to me but i made it through. Oh my god i was happy that i made it through because after the O levels training I have been slacking for 8 - 9 months and yesterday was my first day of exercising. We went through 3 sets of 6 chin ups, short run to orchard and ran back to school THEN this is the toughest i guess, we have a sip of water and continue stairs climbing of 12 floor up and down 3 times. My whole body was numb after those training and i expected it. Hehe ! Exhausted, tired, Numb and all kinds of shit.. LOL..  Finally today I am back to update my blog. I don wanna update euro 2004 cause I find it lame !! Finals - Portugal -vs- Greece  Oh my god this is unbelievable ! Greece the underdogs made it through into the finals. That's why I said Underdogs Rules Euro 2004. Today my whole body is aching but unexpectedly is not that pain. Ya I guess that's about all.. Hehe later I going to orchard with my friends !! Keith Wendy Elaine.....and More and more !! hehe !! LEt's Chill Out !!   **All Rights Reserved - Brooklyn** Proudly Present To You By Brooklyn-
