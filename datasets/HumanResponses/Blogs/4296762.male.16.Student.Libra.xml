      hmm where to begin... ok lets see: today was a day full of stress and worry and exuastion, all because cassie and kt mentioned that sarah had to talk to me and then didnt tell me if it was a good or a bad thing and i worried. Right now Im sitting at my computer free of all that however, as i found out it was all over nothing at all. Some issues sarah and i had to work through were adressed and now all is right in the world.  Next all i have to say is today i went shopping and picked up a kickass watch and a kickass t shirt  urlLink http://www.hottopic.com/store/product.asp?LS=0&ITEM=270205&amp;RN=292  (go there to see shirt).  Peace!!

      Went to my friend kt's party today, which was pretty fun. Only had one problem, the fact that one of my best friends was extreemly down. And i cant help but try to help, so i did. I was unable to cheer her up though, no matter what i said. But she came around a bit over time. One great part of today however was i got to see sarah again ^_^. Thats my whole reason i went, cause ide see her. So I had a [retty good time... until i got home, and talked to Cassie's boyfriend (cassie is my best friend i mentioned). Her boyfriend, Steve (my best friend), was down too and he dragged me down and i dont know what ot do, so i say they should just break up and go their seperate ways because niether of them can be happy really, but thats just my opinion. Well im off to bed then, so ill post again later, hopefully with happy news
