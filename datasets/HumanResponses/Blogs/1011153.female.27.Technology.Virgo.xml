      The astute among you will note that this run is a minute shorter than the 5th one.  This run was three minutes running, one minute walking--which is much harder than the previous run-walk ratio.  I was feeling good until the 4th repetition, which was difficult, and I really struggled through the 5th one.  Tonight I noticed a very odd sensation.  While I was happy to take the little walking breaks, I found that the moment I started running again after each break my legs felt really invigorated.  I'm sure there's some clever scientific name for this phenomenon.  However, I'm also sure there's  no  clever scientific name for the fact that I'm really, really glad tonight's run is over.

      So the pressing question was whether I should increase my total running time or decrease my walking time.  Since the schedule I'm following says to increase running time, I decided to do that.  They're the experts, after all--I'm just the one in the expensive shoes.  While today didn't exactly feel what I would call "good," it didn't feel bad either.  Actually, after my third repetition I felt like a million bucks; after my fourth, I flagged a bit.  But I made it through to my 7th repetition without feeling like my lungs were inside out.  I probably could have done 8 repetitions, if the truth be told, but I'm sure I'll regret saying that on Wednesday.  Jon has just decided to go on a health kick too; he says that he's going to join me in running.  I think I might be a little bit too slow for him.  Today I definitely felt like a jogger rather than a runner--I think it has to do with the massive amount of crap (chocolate syrup, ice cream, crisps, pizza, etc.) I've been eating over the past couple of days.

      I can assure you that it was not laughably easy.  It wasn't as hard as last time, but it still felt pretty painful.  I didn't start thinking I was going. to. die. until the 4th repetition, at which point I again told myself that I was only going to do 5 repetitions.  I even had all sorts of excuses figured out: I was running at midday in the sun; I was running in the park on uneven ground, I was feeling vaguely hung-over.  But in the end it was the thought of coming here and writing down the fact that I had wussed out that made me do the 6th repetition.  Now I have the reward of a hot bath.

      Tonight I decided to decrease the walking time between the periods of running.  I did 2 minutes on, one minute off, repeated 6 times.  After the first 2 repetitions, I felt like I was going. to. die.  But the middle two were fine; I was on top of the world.  I considered only doing 5 repetitions, but when I finished the 5th, I was further away from my house than I expected, so I slogged on to a 6th.  The 6th repetition was a real struggle.  I was literally forcing myself to put one foot in front of the other.  The knowledge of a hot bath was the only thing that kept me going.  Then I had to run past my house to finish out the time.  Psychologically, I found that upsetting.  I also find the people on the sidewalks upsetting.  I have this paranoid fantasy that all people who see me running are runners themselves, and they're critiquing me.  When I'm feeling slow and down, I find that forcing myself into a sprint helps me get past it.  Even though I'm not a fast runner by any means, I prefer to run at speed rather than to jog.  I'm not sure if this was a struggle because I didn't run for over a week, or if it was because it was genuinely more difficult than my last run.  Anyway, I'm sure I'll laugh at myself on Saturday when I go out and do the same run again and I find it laughably easy.

      I spent a long weekend in Edinburgh, doing more walking around than usual, but not doing any running.  In the meantime, however, my knee felt fantastic.  After the ACL surgery I lost most of my muscle tone, which meant that my kneecap wasn't tracking properly, which led to some clicking and aching when walking, especially when walking down steps.  Now, after only two runs, I can feel a real difference in the way my knee feels when going down stairs.  It's almost normal, which is something I don't take for granted.

      Tonight I did the 2 minutes running, 2 minutes walking deal (repeated 4 times), which is the recommended first run for 10 training according to the schedule I've decided to use.  I have to admit that it was far too easy.  I came in the house having not even broken a sweat.  Because it was so easy, I'm not sure whether to increase the overall time out or decrease the in-between walking times.  There seem to be definite advantages and disadvantages to both.

      My initial plan was to start on a basic 10k training schedule,  urlLink as described here .  However, tonight--my first night out--was still a little bit of a tester, so I ran for 1 minute, walked for 1 minute, and repeated that 6 times.  It was reasonably hard work, but it wasn't anything scary, and my knee felt fine.  I feel that I am ready to move onto the proper 10k training schedule.

      Whoever reads this (if there is anyone) might think I'm not taking this running thing very seriously.  I am, believe me, but you have to understand that the past few weeks and the next few weeks are full up.  There are plenty of nights where I get 5 hours of sleep because I'm busy doing things I must do (and there's precious little reading or watching TV going on), then the next day I'm shattered because I only got 5 hours of sleep.  Fitting in half an hour of running, while technically feasible, is not always an incredibly attractive option.  Cycling, however, is a happy medium.  But I have been afraid to cycle recently for two reasons:  1) Last October, running + cycling really made my knee hurt.  Running was ok, but cycling actually caused my knee to react so badly that I couldn't run anymore.  2) My chain is rusty.  I've been running (if you can call it that) for a few weeks with no bad reaction from my knee at all, so I thought tonight I would give cycling a go.  On closer inspection my chain wasn't too bad (though I probably should replace it), so I braved it.  Because I haven't cycled in a while and I was worried that either my knee or my chain would break, I didn't go too far afield, and only did half an hour.  It's not particularly hard work for me, even on the hardest gears, and it's an excellent opportunity to make my left leg work harder (because I would estimate that my left leg is only about 80% as strong as my right leg now).  We shall see how my knee reacts, but I'll probably be cycling more if it's ok.

      I'm amazed that, even being so lazy as to go out only once a week for the past couple of weeks, I've managed to improve each week.  Today I ran for 7 minutes, walked for 2, ran for 4, walked for 2, and ran for 7.  That's what 7 (2) 4 (2) 7 means in the subject line.  I think that makes more sense than trying to reckon up the fraction each time.  I mean, really.  What was I thinking?  So tonight was eventful.  I didn't mention it in my last post, but last week someone actually  stopped me to ask for directions  while I was running--while there were  other people  around.  I wrote it off to the absurdity that is present in everyday society, but today, as I ran towards an elderly man who was carrying his dog, he asked me, "Are you jogging?"  Of course I am!  Do I look like I'm, for example, fishing?  Could the direction-asker and the elderly man really not tell?  Do I just look like I'm going for a leisurely stroll?  Then, as I was running along on the sidewalk next to the park, a snivelling brat kicked his football at me, hard.  I don't think he appreciated it when I called him a "little prick."  But he was.  I hope he falls out of a tree and breaks his ankle in three places.  I now have comments, so if you feel the need to tell me what a heartless, child-hating bitch I am, please feel free.  I like these new Blogger templates; they're pretty.

      I know, it was a week.  I am trying.  ("You can say that again, ha ha!")  (Ahh, do you see what I did there?: I used the word "trying" as a verb, and then pretended that someone else implied that it was used as an adjective.  Ahhhh!)  Anyway, so when I went out, I said to myself, "Self, why not just run until you really feel like you have to stop, instead of adhering rigidly to this schedule?"  So I did.  And I ran for 6 minutes.  Now, I wasn't really all that tired after 6 minutes (compared to the last 6 minutes I did, anyway).  It's not my legs that complain, and I don't get cramps in my sides or anything.  The main problem that makes me have to stop is my chest/lungs aching.  I've always been this way and thought it was normal, but  urlLink this page says it's not .  Hmmm.  So I had to walk for 2 minutes until my lungs stopped aching, then I did 4 minutes running again, then 2 minutes walking, then the final 6 minutes running.  If you're thinking that a full 20 minutes of running shouldn't be that hard to achieve, remember that I've been totally,  totally  inactive for a year.

      I think that running is akin to childbirth in some respects (not that I've ever given birth): while you're doing it, it's painful and terrible and you can't imagine ever doing it again, not in a million years, and you curse the bastard that got you into it in the first place (in running's case, yourself).  But then it's over, and you have a shower, and you sit down to blog about it, and it feels great.  Running, that is.  My analogy ended in the first paragraph.  You weren't still trying to make it work for this one, were you?  Anyway, I didn't do myself any favors by not running for nearly a week.  In case you're curious, a combination of factors including illness, DIY-mania, and heavy rain contributed to my sloth.  Tonight I went out thinking, "Do I really have to bother with the run-walk nonsense?  Can't I just run out for 10 minutes, then run back for 10 minutes?"  The answer is no.  I did the same run as before, and by the end of the second repetition I looked over at my house (which faces the park) and seriously considered running home right then, jumping the fence, and going in the back door.  Then I remembered that my back door was locked (safety first, kids!) and that in order to get home I'd have to go back the way I came, round the corner, and down the road again.  And by the time I thought of all the logistics, my repetition was over.  Later, something funny happened on my 4th repetition: I started running, and suddenly the 3 minutes was over, just like that.  I thought I must have shortchanged myself or read my watch wrong, but no: it just went like a hot knife through butter.  Mmmm, butter.  Ahh, that's the other thing.  I haven't had much food today, which might have contributed to my near crash early in the run.  I tried to eat a toasted bacon and guacamole sandwich for lunch, but someone really needs to tell the ladies in the canteen that guacamole should only be served ice cold.  Hot guacamole is nastified.  Oh well, at least there were pink wafers in the tea room.

      I haven't just dropped off the face of the earth.  I went on holiday to the US, where it would be almost rude to exercise.  I'm back now, and as soon as I'm over my jetlag I'll be back in the saddle/running shoes.
