						   So, I'm staying at my aunts house this weekend. Which would kind of suck, except MIles(her husband) has a CJ Martin&Company nylon stringed guitar. It is a classical, but I can totally work around that. Because it is wonderfous. So, I didn't have to drag my guitar all the way here, but mere days without her* send me into states of panic. Half because I would die if something happened to her*. And half because playing is really soothing. Also, Kara, I love you dearly and nothing you could ever do could stop me from it. Whether you like it or not, you're stuck with me for the next two years. Have fun. What would the world be without Pearl Jam? Suckier than now, that's for sure (excuse me, fo' sho')I've had "Ten" for a while now, but I actually listened to all of it in the car ride up ( a six hour car ride up). I also LOVE Vitaology, but hey, who doesn't? Sucky people. that's fo' sho'.  I'm going to stop now, because this isn't making much sense.     *when I said her, I'm refering to the fact that I named her Joan(after Joan Baez) Her name can also be "Deery Lou" because I decorated her with deery-lou applique-esque stickers.

						   I spent some time with a long neglected friend...    my guitar   oh YES. I can play Blackbird now ^_^ anways, parents out until really late SUnday, they left on Wednsday.   Does anyone else feel really bad for Pamela Andersons kids? I mean, whe they get into high school, EVERYONE will have seen their mom fucking people. Anyone with access to the interent could get pictures and video clips. The only rreason people will hang out with them is because they have a hot mom.   Anyone else think that mking atwoman was just another excuse to see Halle Barry in a cat suit?

						   We as in Tweak, Kari, Paul and I) went out today, after the half day of school. Apparently we got half because of "Act 80" but no-one knows what that is. Oh, I hope it's some sort of weird cult with the Young Life kids. They kinda scare me. Isn't church on Sunday enough? Eh, I shouldn't talk, I used to go to Young Life, when I was new in school because I wanted friends. UGH. Those people are  insane . Extremely so.   ANYWAYS. About Aniles.   We had to sit near the skanky middle school people. You know, the ones that will be pregnant crack whores by the tender age of 16? Well, Tweak found out their secret to make-up application  "It's like they go out to a craft store, but copious amounts of brightly coloured ugly glitter, pour glue on their faces and the just dip their head in the glitter. Finish off with fake tan spray and hoops that say "Baby Girl" and you're set!"   AAAAAND NOW... 5 greatest things right now: 1. Massachusetts  for legalizing gay marriage   2. Burger Kind commercials  despite the fact that I would never eat there, the commercials are awesome. I'M SPICE-AY!   3. Crush Boys' eyessss  oh damn homie   4. Beat Poets  does it NEED to be explained?!?!?!   5. Squeaky Fromme/Penpal  the new presidents. Despite the fact that "Penpal" is dead.   Well, I'm off. Bye.

						   I know that human misery is normally brought on by oneself. And I also know that I have absolutly nothing to complain about since there are people ot there who have it so much worse than me. But I hate life.   I just want someone to hold me.  I went for a walk late last night, just wandering about. And I walked by Pauls house...  ...paused...  ...contemplated going in  ...went on.  I just wanted to be in someones-anyones arms. Even Pauls. *sigh* Oh well.

						   Pauls makin' me over...My Fair Lady style. I'm going to learn etiquette, manners, clothes and make-up. He'll just tell me what looks good with the make-up of course, because Ryan's my only guy friend that wears make-up, but he only wear cover up. ANYWAYS...I'm gonna be as hot as I can be. I wore a floral type thing-shirt yesterday, and complements were coming at me like sea-gulls on a beached-sea turtle. Damn. Prom is tonight, but I'm not going. A guy asked me...But I hate those things. I'm probably only going to my senior, and that's only because you kind of have to.    Anyway...Oh he's so adorable. He complemented my shirt to. I became this massive pile of Clare-jello. And blushed like there's no tomorrow...ughhh

						   OH, what a fun day! I went to the playground with Paul and Kara and Tweak and Abbi!!!!!It was so super... We pretended like we were five again. You know... PSYCHE! and JINX! and "I'm telling" and "Ewww!!!Paul has cooties!"  It was so nice to be care-free for that hour or so, just running around...he was still in the back of my head. But oh it was fun.  And then I went to the therapists, where we talked about how much of a bitch the art teacher is. ANd NOW I'm watching Hedwig And The Angry Inch (oh man, Micheal Pitt) And the music is so catchy and fun and I'm in the kinds of moods where Valley Of The Dolls won't cut it. :Origins Of Love" is the greatest song. Well, I'm done for now. Have to go sing along.  ~Clare

						   This is the awesomely awesome new blog by your-truly...  ME!  *whoot*?  anyways, I already have a diary, BUT I wanna do some work on HTML and I like having one that all of my friend don't have access to. Don't get me wrong, I love my friends BUT sometimes, having strangers read something from my head, is more personal than my friends. Maybe it's the anonmity(sp?) of the World Wide Web...or maybe I'm crazy...but hey, who isn't? In the immortal words of Jeannie from the movie version on the Broadway hit HAiR, "Yeah I'm crazy, you're crazy, everyone's crazy, but it's worse if you don't aknowledge it!"(may not be quoted word-for-word, but I haven't seen the movie for a while) ANYWAYS. A bit about moi... I'm 15...but at times I can seem older than that...other times I sound like I'm 5, but whatre you gona do? I love Bob Dylan and Jack Off Jill I'm part of generation-pill... ...though I have them, I don't take them I'm oly good at art and music and writing... ...and I have doubts about those talents a lot I have a raging rush on what could be called a "jock"... ...but he's into good music, he's quiet and he's no a druggie... ...damn he's gorgeous I play the guitar and violin I'm going to marry Micheal Pitt... were gonna live in NYC and talk about politics and read great literay classics and contemporary classics, and have The White Stripes, Bob Dylan and Jessika of Jack Off Jill ovr for kous-kous and tempeh I'm a vegitarian I'm very interested in eastern religion and philosophy I follow no "religion" but if I were to, it would be either Yoga or Buddhism... ...if only it were'nt a commercial religion now   that's all now...bye bye ~Clare
