Help, help, and more help! -Dull in Pencilvania Dear Pencilvania, Try prying out the plastic part of the tip and sticking it in the back Meanwhile, does a brain come with your pencils? Dear Victoria, I'm a rabbit. Rabbits like carrots. My problem? I don't. Should I grin and bear it and eat them anyways, or what? -Tickled pink, not orange Dear Orange, Or what!

Did you ask for suggestions because you needed something to fill up space or because you're just plain dumb? -Victoria Solve-it Dear Kitti's Korner, I do not have any suggestions or mice problems, but I do have a poem. Read on: A Small Culprit Where has all our cheese gone? Has it sailed to seas and yon? The basket for the rolls It's empty; It was full! When you find the sum Of all that's left, there's only crumbs! The culprit? We don't know, But we look to the floor and lo! There he lay beside the cat, And the cat, how proud he sat! The thief, he was a mouse, Who had raied our whole house. The mouse the cat had killed, Which was, in the end, what we'd willed. But a sad sight he was there, And a sorrowful look did he bear. Goodbye, my friendly foe, With a large victory, and a quiet woe. -Joy Happy Saved by a Girlscout I looked around my office... the mounted moose head, the file cabinets with the letter magnets and world globe on top, down to the old wooden office desk, with the pull-out platform for my old manual typewriter, Old Bess. I got her at an auction in Burmingham. You can't see her e, her print is faded,and there's a line between all the letters- but she's the most trusty typewriter I've ever had. Also the only. But I only do rough drafts on that, then I give it to Miss Finchley (but I call her Laura) to give it he final touches on her computer. Not a single human being there; no one except Laura and myself. There lay old Brutus, my golden retriever, who is ten years old and deaf. "How you doing there, Brutus, old boy?" I scratched his stomach and he groaned in reply. Read the next episode of "Saved by a Girlscout" for more! !~~Kitti~~!
