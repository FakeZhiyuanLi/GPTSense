      Another one dead. This time killed by my own father, when he reversed the vehicle. Was not at home to see him for the last time, but I guess this must be a blessing.. Having seen my little kitty in pieces would be incredibly traumatic.

      My friend Adelaine wrote about good and bad karma some days ago. Talking about karma, it has been said that good deeds in our past life would result in a good karma.   Cats and fishes enjoy a cruel twist of fate. Fishes are an unattainable staple food for cats. I wonder what had triggered cats to be so fond of this fishy delicacy? I believe that most of us can understand the lion's inclination towards savannah antelopes, as these herbivores are forever prancing around these meat-eaters waitng to be ravished.   But how did the cat and fish meet? The cat certainly did not meet the fish in an aquarium, while having a leisurely swim! But what exactly is God's (whoever is the creator, in the&nbsp;meantime, god will suffice)&nbsp;intention when he/she established this doomed feline-fish relationship. The cat must be in very, very deep pain as his/her only gastronomic pleasure is so unattainable. These is no way in the world where the cat will jump into running streams and still waters just for a satisfactory dinner. All it can do is lust after it.   Isn't that bad karma for the cat? What has it done in it's past life??   So, what does the cat do? Basically, there is just no other way. So the cat is reduced to do some serious plotting and making devious plans to get what it wants. Wonder why cats purr and rubs themselves on our legs, making us fell good and loved? It's a ploy!!   When we feel good, we will fall into the kitty's little trap. We will willingly supply all the fish that it wants!   The lesson is : Don't blame on our bad karma, there is always an alternative way of getting our way when shitty stuff happens.&nbsp;This is proven true!!!&nbsp;   Just a little&nbsp;lesson that I learn from my kitties at home. Not scientically proven. Do not use this against me, okay?   *wink wink* Adelaine!&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       This is something I have always wanted to share with you all. Itâ€™s taken from Naomi Wolfâ€™s book, The Beauty Myth. This is disturbing but so true! This is about the bulimia and anorexia phenomena and the double standard that women face in terms of reaction from the world. Anyway enjoy (if you can) and ponder:     There is a disease spreading. It taps on the shoulder Americaâ€™s firstborn sons, its best and brightest. At its touch, they turn away from food. Their bones swell out from receding flesh. Shadows invade their faces. They walk slowly, with the effort of old men. A white spittle forms on their lips. They can swallow only pellets of bread, and a little thin milk. First tens, then hundreds, then thousands, until among the most affluent families, one young son in five is stricken. Many are hospitalized, many die.   The boys of the ghetto die young, and America has lived with that. But these boys are the golden ones to whom the reins of the world are to be lightly tossed: the captain of the Princeton football team, the head of the Berkeley debating club, the editor of the Harvard Crimson. Then a quarter of the Dartmouth rugby team falls ill; then a third of Yaleâ€™s secret societies. The heirs, the cream, the fresh delegates to the nationâ€™s forum selectively waste away.   The American disease spreads eastward. It strikes young men at the Sorbonne, in Londonâ€™s Inns of Court, in the administration of the Hague, in the Bourse, in the universities of Edinburgh and Salamanca. They grow thin and still more thin. They can hardly speak aloud. They lose their libido, and can no longer make an effort to joke or argue. When they run or swim, they look appalling: buttocks collapsed, tailbones protruding, knees knocked together, ribs splayed in a shelf that stretches their papery skin. There is no medical reason.   The disease mutates again. Across America, it becomes apparent that for every well-born living skeleton there are at least three other young men, also bright lights, who do something just as strange. Once they have swallowed their steaks and wine, now they hide away, to thrust their fingers down their throats and spew out all the nourishment in them. They wander back, shaking and pale. Eventually they arrange their lives so that they can spend hours each day hunched over like that, their highly trained minds telescoped around two shameful holes: mouth, toilet; toilet, mouth.   What is happening to our fine young me, in their brush cuts and khaki trousers? It hurts to look at them. At their expense-paid lunches, they hide their medallions of veal under lettuce leaves. Secretly, they purge. They vomit after matriculation banquets and after tailgate parties at the Game. The menâ€™s room in the Oyster Bar reeks with it.   How would America react to the mass self-immolation by hunger of its favourite sons? How would Western Europe absorb the export of such a disease? One would expect an emergency response: crisis task forces convened in congressional hearing rooms, unscheduled alumni meetings, the best experts money can hire, cover stories in news and magazines, blame and counter-blame, bulletins, warnings, symptoms, updates; an epidemic blazoned in boldface red. The sons of privilege are the future; the future is committing suicide.   Of course this is all happening right now, only with a gender difference. The institution that shelter and promote these diseases are hibernating. The public conscience are fast asleep.  The world is not coming to an end because the cherished child in five who â€œchoosesâ€ to die slowly is a girl.    Up to one tenth of young American women, up to one fifth of women students in the US are locked into one-woman hunger camps.  When they fall, there are no memorial services, no intervention through awareness programs, no formal messages from their schools and the colleges that the society prefers its young women to eat and thrive rather than sicken and die.    The weight-loss cult recruits women form an early age, and eating diseases are the cultâ€™s bequest. Anorexia and bulimia are female maladies: From 90 to 95 percent of anorexics and bulimics are women. America, which has the greatest number of women who have made it into the male sphere, also leads the world with female anorexia.   The medical effects of anorexia include hypothermia, bradycardia (impaired heartbeat), lanugo (growth of body hair), infertility and death. The medical effects of bulimia include dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, epileptic seizure, abnormal heart rhythm and death. Babies and children underfed by weight-conscious mothers are suffering from stunted growth, delayed puberty and failure to thrive.   -Naomi Wolf, The Beauty Myth

      Seriously, I am addicted to salt. Itâ€™s no joke! Really, I AM addicted to salt. Salt to me is like sugar to sugar addicts, maple syrup to pancake lovers, cheesecake to the fromage crowd, cola to the fad-crazed adolescent who is into mass commercialism and crappy drink laced with phosphoric acid, espresso to the caffeine-addict (btw, I have a friend who downs around three of these potent blends before bedtime and still manage to sleep like a baby; you know who you are). Me on the other hand have never been able to handle a caffeine fix, my hands would tremble after a lattÃ© (can u believe that?!). That would then be followed by heart palpitation, cold sweat, a mild bit of hallucination; general restlessness and whole lot more of really abnormal physical and mental reactions.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have always wanted to know, just what is the ratio between the sugar addicts and the very few salt addicts out there? Lemme see&nbsp; (slowly going over friends and their taste preference..), itâ€™s sugar, sugar, sugar, another sugar, sugar again and finally a â€œsambalâ€ fan. But then again, there is another chilli fan too! Guess that I am not a total weirdo afterall..  &nbsp;  But then again, why are there not much people who like me, appreciates the wonders of salt? Salt is a wonderful addition to foodstuff. I love soy sauce, I love the savoury taste of cheese, I love potato chips but the best of all, I love salt on my fruits. All salt lovers, please come out and shout it out!!!  &nbsp;  I especially love salt with pineapples, green Granny Smith apples, oranges, limes, tomatoes (mmm..), guavas, mangoes, cucumber and watermelon (sometimes). Of all mentioned, the best has got to be TOMATOES! Tomatoes go wonderfully with salt. Have you tried it? This is the reason why I love tomato juice. The salty taste of tomato juice is sure to be tantalizing. I savour every bit and drop from the bottle every time I get myself one. I cannot bear the regretful feeling if I miss a single drop. Someone once told me that he canâ€™t understand my love for this juice, it seem like blood to him. And it tasted that way too (or so it seemed to him).  &nbsp;  My point is: the essence of tomato juice that makes it so freaking wonderful is of course, salt.  &nbsp;   Advantage : Haha, I donâ€™t get sucked into the crappy dessert thing cuz plainly; I am not in the least bit interested. And I donâ€™t have to go on chocolate binge to keep me on a constant high (so I canâ€™t be bribed). And I can greedily indulge in all main courses, cuz that is where all the salt is.  &nbsp;  So people, donâ€™t buy me chocolates anymore, okay?  &nbsp;   Badâ€¦. : I am definitely overdosing. Kidney failure is definitely not a risk to be taken lightly.  &nbsp;  So fellow friends, if you have an even weirder craving and eating preference, please donâ€™t hesitate to speak it out. I donâ€™t want to be the only weirdo over hereâ€¦ hehe   Thatâ€™s all for today. Maybe I will write something about boozing some other day.  p/s: Tomato fans unite! Check  urlLink this  out! Yummy!!!!!

      This is embarassing.   Have you been in a situation where you do not remember the name of a friend even though you try really, really hard to? I met some people during my friend's convocation today and to be honest, I really can't figure out their names.   So, what I did, you wonder??   Haha.. I just ignored her and looked somewhere else. That is so much safer.   Does it mean that she is not a friend? So, what is a friend? I can't seem to be able to categorize her as a friend when I can't even remember her name.   I am surrounded by a few friends who mean the whole world to me. I think that's it.   The question is :  What makes a&nbsp;friend a friend?   &nbsp;  Can it be measured by a time frame? If yes, is there some sort of probation period for a friendship? Do we seive our friends? Are friends a choice or a part of so-called "fate"? What else are the parameters? E.g. less than 10 sms/month=acquaintance, more than 30sms/month=friend?? Absurd!!!!   Hope I find an answer to this and in the mean time, I will try hard to recall her name... Btw, it's WC's friend and I don't think she is called Jennifer... Sorry.

       I will start this article with a pinch of irony.   Exactly 2 hours ago, I was writing an article to be published in this blog. It was an optimistic entry (which is quite rare, really), titled â€œI Am Blessedâ€. For the past few weeks, I really felt blessed. My steps were springy, my face smiling all the time. I felt so invincible, adequate and generally, blessed. No one seems to be able hurt me; nothing upsets me. No amount of insults (intentional or otherwise) can bring me down. It was a great feeling! As if I was on an eternal high. No less.   I did not know what had triggered this happiness and incredible sense of self-confidence! Probably it was because life had been generally good to me. I have 4 adorable kittens (which I love to bits!), my friends were great, my family was awesome, school was sh*t but well, I survived.   Talking about happiness, I think mine came from my newfound ability to NOT put any value to my material possessions. Not that I have a lot of expensive stuff.. I mean not much importance is placed on my worldly possessions. I donâ€™t care if I lose my money, I donâ€™t care if someone f**ks up my grades, I definitely wonâ€™t care too much if I lose my purse or something. Not when I have things far more important than those.   I do not believe in pouring my affections and love on say, a Nike bag, Deuter backpack, or a necklace, diamonds..   I have great friends (I have always wanted to tell you guys just how great you are), brothers (sarcastic, but funny though not very helpful at times), not-so-cool parents but who are all the time supportive, a great environment to live in (maybe except school) and many more. Life is blessed in a way though it is not perfect. I have learnt to appreciate people and little souls around me and I find a wonderful attachment that I do not sense in an inanimate object. Apart from family, friends and my loved one, I have found an innocent kind of love in my little kittens. They became a pit in which I poured my attention and care into.   Everything was great until someone killed my kitten. It was a hit and run. She took almost half an hour to die. There was nothing I could do to help her ease her pain. She was beyond help. Her body was still warm when I was finally able to bury her. It was the most painful moment of my life.   Suddenly, things do not seem so rosy anymore. She has taken a part of my invincibility away with her, into the depth of her little grave; under the flowering pink trumpet tree.    Little Miss Cat  1st June 2004  till  14th July 2004    I feel a little bit more vulnerable now. But this has taught me to appreciate those around me. Hopefully in due time, I will succeed in coming out with a genuinely optimistic article, not laced even with the tiniest pinch or irony and sarcasm.

The lesson is : Don't blame on our bad karma, there is always an alternative way of getting our way when shitty stuff happens.&nbsp;This is proven true!!!&nbsp;   Just a little&nbsp;lesson that I learn from my kitties at home. Not scientically proven. Do not use this against me, okay?   *wink wink* Adelaine!&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       This is something I have always wanted to share with you all. Itâ€™s taken from Naomi Wolfâ€™s book, The Beauty Myth. This is disturbing but so true! This is about the bulimia and anorexia phenomena and the double standard that women face in terms of reaction from the world. Anyway enjoy (if you can) and ponder:     There is a disease spreading. It taps on the shoulder Americaâ€™s firstborn sons, its best and brightest. At its touch, they turn away from food. Their bones swell out from receding flesh. Shadows invade their faces. They walk slowly, with the effort of old men. A white spittle forms on their lips. They can swallow only pellets of bread, and a little thin milk. First tens, then hundreds, then thousands, until among the most affluent families, one young son in five is stricken. Many are hospitalized, many die.   The boys of the ghetto die young, and America has lived with that. But these boys are the golden ones to whom the reins of the world are to be lightly tossed: the captain of the Princeton football team, the head of the Berkeley debating club, the editor of the Harvard Crimson. Then a quarter of the Dartmouth rugby team falls ill; then a third of Yaleâ€™s secret societies. The heirs, the cream, the fresh delegates to the nationâ€™s forum selectively waste away.   The American disease spreads eastward. It strikes young men at the Sorbonne, in Londonâ€™s Inns of Court, in the administration of the Hague, in the Bourse, in the universities of Edinburgh and Salamanca. They grow thin and still more thin. They can hardly speak aloud. They lose their libido, and can no longer make an effort to joke or argue. When they run or swim, they look appalling: buttocks collapsed, tailbones protruding, knees knocked together, ribs splayed in a shelf that stretches their papery skin. There is no medical reason.   The disease mutates again. Across America, it becomes apparent that for every well-born living skeleton there are at least three other young men, also bright lights, who do something just as strange. Once they have swallowed their steaks and wine, now they hide away, to thrust their fingers down their throats and spew out all the nourishment in them. They wander back, shaking and pale. Eventually they arrange their lives so that they can spend hours each day hunched over like that, their highly trained minds telescoped around two shameful holes: mouth, toilet; toilet, mouth.   What is happening to our fine young me, in their brush cuts and khaki trousers? It hurts to look at them. At their expense-paid lunches, they hide their medallions of veal under lettuce leaves. Secretly, they purge. They vomit after matriculation banquets and after tailgate parties at the Game. The menâ€™s room in the Oyster Bar reeks with it.   How would America react to the mass self-immolation by hunger of its favourite sons? How would Western Europe absorb the export of such a disease? One would expect an emergency response: crisis task forces convened in congressional hearing rooms, unscheduled alumni meetings, the best experts money can hire, cover stories in news and magazines, blame and counter-blame, bulletins, warnings, symptoms, updates; an epidemic blazoned in boldface red. The sons of privilege are the future; the future is committing suicide.   Of course this is all happening right now, only with a gender difference. The institution that shelter and promote these diseases are hibernating. The public conscience are fast asleep.  The world is not coming to an end because the cherished child in five who â€œchoosesâ€ to die slowly is a girl.    Up to one tenth of young American women, up to one fifth of women students in the US are locked into one-woman hunger camps.  When they fall, there are no memorial services, no intervention through awareness programs, no formal messages from their schools and the colleges that the society prefers its young women to eat and thrive rather than sicken and die.    The weight-loss cult recruits women form an early age, and eating diseases are the cultâ€™s bequest. Anorexia and bulimia are female maladies: From 90 to 95 percent of anorexics and bulimics are women. America, which has the greatest number of women who have made it into the male sphere, also leads the world with female anorexia.   The medical effects of anorexia include hypothermia, bradycardia (impaired heartbeat), lanugo (growth of body hair), infertility and death. The medical effects of bulimia include dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, epileptic seizure, abnormal heart rhythm and death. Babies and children underfed by weight-conscious mothers are suffering from stunted growth, delayed puberty and failure to thrive.   -Naomi Wolf, The Beauty Myth

      Seriously, I am addicted to salt. Itâ€™s no joke! Really, I AM addicted to salt. Salt to me is like sugar to sugar addicts, maple syrup to pancake lovers, cheesecake to the fromage crowd, cola to the fad-crazed adolescent who is into mass commercialism and crappy drink laced with phosphoric acid, espresso to the caffeine-addict (btw, I have a friend who downs around three of these potent blends before bedtime and still manage to sleep like a baby; you know who you are). Me on the other hand have never been able to handle a caffeine fix, my hands would tremble after a lattÃ© (can u believe that?!). That would then be followed by heart palpitation, cold sweat, a mild bit of hallucination; general restlessness and whole lot more of really abnormal physical and mental reactions.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have always wanted to know, just what is the ratio between the sugar addicts and the very few salt addicts out there? Lemme see&nbsp; (slowly going over friends and their taste preference..), itâ€™s sugar, sugar, sugar, another sugar, sugar again and finally a â€œsambalâ€ fan. But then again, there is another chilli fan too! Guess that I am not a total weirdo afterall..  &nbsp;  But then again, why are there not much people who like me, appreciates the wonders of salt? Salt is a wonderful addition to foodstuff. I love soy sauce, I love the savoury taste of cheese, I love potato chips but the best of all, I love salt on my fruits. All salt lovers, please come out and shout it out!!!  &nbsp;  I especially love salt with pineapples, green Granny Smith apples, oranges, limes, tomatoes (mmm..), guavas, mangoes, cucumber and watermelon (sometimes). Of all mentioned, the best has got to be TOMATOES! Tomatoes go wonderfully with salt. Have you tried it? This is the reason why I love tomato juice. The salty taste of tomato juice is sure to be tantalizing. I savour every bit and drop from the bottle every time I get myself one. I cannot bear the regretful feeling if I miss a single drop. Someone once told me that he canâ€™t understand my love for this juice, it seem like blood to him. And it tasted that way too (or so it seemed to him).  &nbsp;  My point is: the essence of tomato juice that makes it so freaking wonderful is of course, salt.  &nbsp;   Advantage : Haha, I donâ€™t get sucked into the crappy dessert thing cuz plainly; I am not in the least bit interested. And I donâ€™t have to go on chocolate binge to keep me on a constant high (so I canâ€™t be bribed). And I can greedily indulge in all main courses, cuz that is where all the salt is.  &nbsp;  So people, donâ€™t buy me chocolates anymore, okay?  &nbsp;   Badâ€¦. : I am definitely overdosing. Kidney failure is definitely not a risk to be taken lightly.  &nbsp;  So fellow friends, if you have an even weirder craving and eating preference, please donâ€™t hesitate to speak it out. I donâ€™t want to be the only weirdo over hereâ€¦ hehe   Thatâ€™s all for today. Maybe I will write something about boozing some other day.  p/s: Tomato fans unite! Check  urlLink this  out! Yummy!!!!!

      This is embarassing.   Have you been in a situation where you do not remember the name of a friend even though you try really, really hard to? I met some people during my friend's convocation today and to be honest, I really can't figure out their names.   So, what I did, you wonder??   Haha.. I just ignored her and looked somewhere else. That is so much safer.   Does it mean that she is not a friend? So, what is a friend? I can't seem to be able to categorize her as a friend when I can't even remember her name.   I am surrounded by a few friends who mean the whole world to me. I think that's it.   The question is :  What makes a&nbsp;friend a friend?   &nbsp;  Can it be measured by a time frame? If yes, is there some sort of probation period for a friendship? Do we seive our friends? Are friends a choice or a part of so-called "fate"? What else are the parameters? E.g. less than 10 sms/month=acquaintance, more than 30sms/month=friend?? Absurd!!!!   Hope I find an answer to this and in the mean time, I will try hard to recall her name... Btw, it's WC's friend and I don't think she is called Jennifer... Sorry.

       I will start this article with a pinch of irony.   Exactly 2 hours ago, I was writing an article to be published in this blog. It was an optimistic entry (which is quite rare, really), titled â€œI Am Blessedâ€. For the past few weeks, I really felt blessed. My steps were springy, my face smiling all the time. I felt so invincible, adequate and generally, blessed. No one seems to be able hurt me; nothing upsets me. No amount of insults (intentional or otherwise) can bring me down. It was a great feeling! As if I was on an eternal high. No less.   I did not know what had triggered this happiness and incredible sense of self-confidence! Probably it was because life had been generally good to me. I have 4 adorable kittens (which I love to bits!), my friends were great, my family was awesome, school was sh*t but well, I survived.   Talking about happiness, I think mine came from my newfound ability to NOT put any value to my material possessions. Not that I have a lot of expensive stuff.. I mean not much importance is placed on my worldly possessions. I donâ€™t care if I lose my money, I donâ€™t care if someone f**ks up my grades, I definitely wonâ€™t care too much if I lose my purse or something. Not when I have things far more important than those.   I do not believe in pouring my affections and love on say, a Nike bag, Deuter backpack, or a necklace, diamonds..   I have great friends (I have always wanted to tell you guys just how great you are), brothers (sarcastic, but funny though not very helpful at times), not-so-cool parents but who are all the time supportive, a great environment to live in (maybe except school) and many more. Life is blessed in a way though it is not perfect. I have learnt to appreciate people and little souls around me and I find a wonderful attachment that I do not sense in an inanimate object. Apart from family, friends and my loved one, I have found an innocent kind of love in my little kittens. They became a pit in which I poured my attention and care into.   Everything was great until someone killed my kitten. It was a hit and run. She took almost half an hour to die. There was nothing I could do to help her ease her pain. She was beyond help. Her body was still warm when I was finally able to bury her. It was the most painful moment of my life.   Suddenly, things do not seem so rosy anymore. She has taken a part of my invincibility away with her, into the depth of her little grave; under the flowering pink trumpet tree.    Little Miss Cat  1st June 2004  till  14th July 2004    I feel a little bit more vulnerable now. But this has taught me to appreciate those around me. Hopefully in due time, I will succeed in coming out with a genuinely optimistic article, not laced even with the tiniest pinch or irony and sarcasm.

      Another one dead. This time killed by my own father, when he reversed the vehicle. Was not at home to see him for the last time, but I guess this must be a blessing.. Having seen my little kitty in pieces would be incredibly traumatic.

      My friend Adelaine wrote about good and bad karma some days ago. Talking about karma, it has been said that good deeds in our past life would result in a good karma.   Cats and fishes enjoy a cruel twist of fate. Fishes are an unattainable staple food for cats. I wonder what had triggered cats to be so fond of this fishy delicacy? I believe that most of us can understand the lion's inclination towards savannah antelopes, as these herbivores are forever prancing around these meat-eaters waitng to be ravished.   But how did the cat and fish meet? The cat certainly did not meet the fish in an aquarium, while having a leisurely swim! But what exactly is God's (whoever is the creator, in the&nbsp;meantime, god will suffice)&nbsp;intention when he/she established this doomed feline-fish relationship. The cat must be in very, very deep pain as his/her only gastronomic pleasure is so unattainable. These is no way in the world where the cat will jump into running streams and still waters just for a satisfactory dinner. All it can do is lust after it.   Isn't that bad karma for the cat? What has it done in it's past life??   So, what does the cat do? Basically, there is just no other way. So the cat is reduced to do some serious plotting and making devious plans to get what it wants. Wonder why cats purr and rubs themselves on our legs, making us fell good and loved? It's a ploy!!   When we feel good, we will fall into the kitty's little trap. We will willingly supply all the fish that it wants!   The lesson is : Don't blame on our bad karma, there is always an alternative way of getting our way when shitty stuff happens.&nbsp;This is proven true!!!&nbsp;   Just a little&nbsp;lesson that I learn from my kitties at home. Not scientically proven. Do not use this against me, okay?   *wink wink* Adelaine!&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;
