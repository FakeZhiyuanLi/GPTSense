      This feels like something that ive always wanted to do.  i have lived for 47 years and i still cant believe how my memories seem to resemble dramas.  i was born in 1957. that was about 50 years ago. so now im an antique even though i still feel like the 5 year old who was allowed to play outside till it got dark.&nbsp; i would go up and down my suburbian development as it was still being developed and play in the still unfinished houses.  it was the typical late fifties lifestyle. the houses were new the clothes were new but the values were old.  my parents married after dating for less than a year. my mom wasnt pregnant but they had had sex and in those days that ment you were destined for the altar or the chupa since were jewish.  my mother found motherhood a crisis in her life. since my brother and I were born 16 months apart my memories are of her being very upset and anxous most of the time. from an early age i learned to stay outside as long as i could.   my earliest memories are of loving danger. anna marie and i pulling up our shirts and comparing bellies at 3 seemed like a forbidden pleasure. playing statue on a summer night until after dark without any parents in sight was a memory i treasure.  memories of school are like a dark and upsetting greyness against the bright happiness of my younger memories.  i remember thinking that kindergarten wasnt too bad but first grade with its sitting in a seat for long periods was like perutory.  i recall staying in with the teacher for extra help and staring dumstruck at the deep wrinkles in her tongue. thats how close she was to me and all i could think about was if it was normal for old people to have deep crevacies in tongues that were pimpled with bumps or if this tongue was a normal occurance of getting old. her teeth were yellow and crooked and her breath was smelly. consequently i learned very little in first grade except how to like on the eye test to get out of class and to wear glasses that made me dizzy since i didnt need them anyway. the light of my first grade memories are of a blueish quality.  second grade was more pleasant i learned how to turn the top part of a shoebox into my secrest apartment where my erasures lived. the boy who sat next to me joined my game and we had many months of silent play until the teacher noticed and moved our seats. by that point second grade was almost over. my mother had taken matters into her own hans and taught me how to read by patiently reading with me every night and by third grade I had advanced to become one of the best readers on my grade and i know this because they gave us some kind of standardized test and i scored so hight the asst principle came in to meet me. i had a kind teacher named mrs rother and we used an SRA approach where we read independently on our own level and then answered questions. i enjoyed reading but still couldnt subtract to save my life. i never could concentrate on it long enough to figure it out and of course i coulnt concentrate during class so i was lost. but i remember making a paper mache globe and painting it green and blue.  i went to public school and the colors in the early sixties were pink and orange and the dresses were short and tights were pink fishnet. I wore plaid skirts and jumpers, blouses with peter pan collors and knee socks. i was dressed like i went to a uniformed school even though i didnt. i remember looking down at my new penny loafers with the shiny pennies securely in their spots thankful not to be wearing those babiesh saddle shoes.  lunches i remember clearly. there was a chow mein day with sticky white rice covered by well cooked vegetables and sliced chicken crowned by crunchy noodles. Spagettie day was soggy pasta soaked in meat sauce garnished with white bread smothered in garlik butter. grilled cheese day was greesy and chewy.  desert was fugicle or creamsicle. we ate it in the playground as we wandered with a small taste of freedom.  in third grade i met carol my lifelong best friend , still is  she shared my longing for adventure and we made up a game where we would take turns closing our eyes&nbsp; and being led around then when we were good and confused we would walk unattended&nbsp; with our eyes still closed. the one who could stand walking with their eyes closed the longest or who really bumped into something was the winner. but we got into heated arguements accuesing each other of cheating and usually the whistle to line up would blow and we forgot about it till the next recess.  one recess stands out in my memory. There was a rousing game at recess of tag that i think a participated in uneventfully untill one afternoon when i ran too quickly into a spot of gravel covered asphalt. i slid hard and fast cutting up my hands and face. my tears mixed with blood as a i went inside with a monitor to find the nurse. she was eating lunch. i was told to wait in the cafeteriea until she was done. i must have been about 7 or 8. all i can recall after that was hating the person who would rather eat than put me out of my misery and of walking back to class frightened and ashamed of my now cleaned but still scraped up face. as childhood goes the afternoon turned uneventfull once more and school left no other memories. like how everyone forgets who was the one who threw up and only remembers the smell and sight of it on the floor. i was a happy child once again running off the bus towards home knowing now that more important news our family vacation loomed ahead since this was the friday before chirstmas vacation. my mother was waiting on the porch and her happpy welcoming face turned ugly when she saw my face. "What happened to you" was her almost angry accusing face. instantly like a button had been pressed the horror of my day flashed before me once again and the tears cut into my fresh wounds and burned anew.
