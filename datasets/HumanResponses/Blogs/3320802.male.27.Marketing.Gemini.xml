      Wow! What a weekend. I took off Thursday afternoon and met my dad at my place. We headed to the airport. We had a short lay over in Detroit and we were on our way to Orlando. My sister picked us up and we crashed at her house that night. Woke up too early the next day and headed an Ocean view condo my uncle rented about 20 miles from Savannah called Tybee Island. We all arrived and talked and my cousin came over and we headed out to see the town and went to The Crab Shack. Very interesting place. They just lay out a bunch of seafood in front of you and you have to work to eat it. Then we went to a park where George Clinton was having a free concert. The next day I woke up and went out to the next to say good morning to the ocean. Not sure if there is anything more soothing than that. We went to my cousin's graduation from Savannah College of Arts & Design. My cousin Drew now has a degree in Animation and he showed something he made, amazing stuff! He'll go far! Then we had lunch at an awesome Mexican restaurant and took a tour of Old Savannah. Saw where some of "Forrest Gump" was filmed. Then we took a boat ride around Tybee Island. One of the highlights of the trip! After that my sister, dad, & I headed back to Orlando and woke up for an early flight. My dad and I stopped for a birthday lunch at Old Chicago. I sent him on his way to my mom who couldn't come because of work. I then went to see some friends and had dinner at their house. Today is my day off. I am running errands and am working on a website for my cousin! Tonight a bunch of friends and I are getting together for dinner at  urlLink Julio's . No better gift that being surrounded by your best friends - laughing and having a great time!

      Got up this morning at 5 to get ready for my day. Really couldn't sleep. I'll probably go into work early so I can leave early. My cousin graduates from college this weekend. He made the logo on  urlLink www.roommateproductions.com .   I was supposed to have my  urlLink book  done by Monday, that was my goal, but things change and I want to spend more time tweaking it to make it the best that I can. I still hope to have it out by Christmas! I'm having a big get together for my birthday! I can't wait!

      What a crazy busy weekend. Friday night I headed to Lincoln to surprise a friend of mine who was having a crappy day. Saturday I woke up too early and headed to a another friend's house who was having a garage sale. Then I headed back to Omaha to work from home and then do some location scouting for a movie I am working on with a couple friends. That night I went to eat at Panera Bread with some friends and then went to a house my friends were dogsitting for to watch Scream 1 & 2. Got home late and this morning I went to a friend's graduation and then a bunch of us went to eat at Valentino's. I'm working a bit from home now and then I'm doing some more location scouting.  I'm looking forward to this week, althoug it will be busy. I have things to look forward to!

      Wednesday is my longest day. I work from 8-6 and then I'm working from 7-11 from home. At least I don't have to actually work the whole time. I can watch tv or a movie, read a bit, or work on my many websites.

         A story about how life-changing conversations can cause someone to be left standing in contemplation as another person walks away. --- Life. It has the ability to change directly in front of us without our permission or any warning. At times, we have the ability to make changes, but most of the time, change finds us. What we do next is in our power. Do we: deny the change, bargain against it, or accept it?  Occasionally, we have moments where we can sense ourselves change. At times, we have no idea we are changing and sometimes we can only catch a glimpse of small changes when we look in the mirror. It is in these instances of sensing change that we are left standing in contemplation of what we should do, what we should say, and how we should act.  Our true self surfaces during these profound moments of contemplation and reflection; it defines us as individuals as our lives are forever altered. These circumstances, although memorable, don't happen often, however, they occur more frequently than we may ever realize. We remain unaware of their true importance to our lives.   At times, we may be lucky enough to grasp right away the significance of the moment. At times, we may only comprehend days or months down the road the true worth of the impact of words spoken. If not only words spoken, then also the actions made by another person that moves us to look at life differently. We are left standing as a result of their words and actions.   These moments, as powerful as they can become, are usually unplanned. You cannot truly prepare to say to someone exactly what they need to hear. You cannot truly prepare to be moved by what they may say to you.  Reality and recognition become clear as reflection begins. An epiphany is the result.  These are life-altering conversations that change the direction of our path, changes that either make our walk smoother or rougher.  We are  urlLink left standing  before our new path...  © Chad J.

      Here is my day! I work and I edit. I either edit one of four films from  urlLink RoomMate Productions  or I edit the final stages for  urlLink Left Standing . The next three weeks are crucial. I have no idea what I'm going to do once all the editing is done. Oh yeah, I know... marketing & promotions which for me will be a lot of fun! I have a ton of ideas!

             I am the only one to blame for this     Somehow it all adds up the same     Soaring on the wings of selfish pride     I flew too high and like Icarus I collide     With a world I try so hard to leave behind     To rid myself of all but love     to give and die      To turn away and not become     Another nail to pierce the skin of one who loves     more deeply than the oceans,     more abundant than the tear     Of a world embracing every heartache      Can I be the one to sacrifice     Or grip the spear      and watch the blood and water flow      To love you - take my world apart     To need you - I am on my knees     To love you - take my world apart     To need you - broken on my knees      All said and done I stand alone     Amongst remains of a life I should not own     It takes all I am to believe     In the mercy that covers me      Did you really have to die for me?     All I am for all you are     Because what I need and what I believe      are worlds apart      I look beyond the empty cross     forgetting what my life has cost     and wipe away the crimson stains     and dull the nails that still remain     More and more I need you now,     I owe you more each passing hour     the battle between grace and pride     I gave up not so long ago     So steal my heart and take the pain     and wash the feet and cleanse my pride     take the selfish, take the weak,     and all the things I cannot hide     take the beauty, take my tears     the sin-soaked heart and make it yours     take my world all apart     take it now, take it now     and serve the ones that I despise     speak the words I can't deny     watch the world I used to love     fall to dust and thrown away     I look beyond the empty cross     forgetting what my life has cost     so wipe away the crimson stains     and dull the nails that still remain     so steal my heart and take the pain     take the selfish, take the weak     and all the things I cannot hide     take the beauty, take my tears     take my world apart, take my world apart     I pray, I pray, I pray     take my world apart

         Empty again Sunken down so far So scared to fall I might not get up again  So I lay at your feet All my brokenness I carry all of my burdens to you  All of these things I've held up in vain No reason nor rhyme Just the scars that remain Of all of these things I'm so much afraid Scared out of my mind By the demons I've made Sweet Jesus, you never ever let me go Oh, sweet Jesus, never ever let me go  So happy to love Yet so far to go You lead me on to where I've never been before

      As a single Christian male in my mid-twenties, I find myself consciously and unconsciously thinking about and searching for that special someone. My goal has always been to be friends with my future wife for at least a year, date for a year, engaged for a year, which includes being married by the time I’m thirty.  This goal may seem far-fetched and I admit it is, so I’m open to altering it. I know what I want in a future spouse (I think) and I definitely know what I don’t want. But the older I get, the more I realize that the challenge to find someone who fits what I want and what I don’t want seems like “mission: impossible.” My impatience steps in which seems to prolong my wait to meet this future wife of mine. Occasionally, I reflect on the thought that she is out there somewhere so I wonder what she is doing at that very moment and if she is thinking of me. As much as I am actively trying to find someone, I’m reminded by my friends how they found their special someone when they were least expecting to. I have to remind myself and know that God will introduce me to her and reveal who she is when we are both ready.  So does that mean I’m not ready? I think I am, but at times I have my doubts. Maybe she isn’t ready, which could mean that she is doing something to better herself for our relationship. I’ll always go back to the question of if I’m ready or not. How will I know? I believe the answer lies in how I respond to the following questions:  I ask myself if I’m financially ready. Who is? I graduated college a couple of years ago and have already went through two career changes and I have been laid off. Needless to say, my checkbook is nowhere near where I want it to be, I won’t even mention credit cards. So I need to think more about saving for my future, buying a house, and paying off some bills. After all, I don’t want to drag her into my debt and spending habits. I know that I need to better myself in regards to finances.  I ask myself, am I physically fit and attractive? The honest answer is that I’m not in as good of shape as I’d like to be and beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I know I need to join a gym, look online for articles about cooking healthier for bachelors, and watch how many times I go out to eat. What is a better motivator to working out besides looking good for yourself and gaining that confidence, than wanting to look good for your significant other? After all, I hope my wife is attracted to me as I am to her.   I ask myself, am I smart?  With a college degree I think so, until I watch shows like Jeopardy or play board games with friends and I realize that I still have a lot to learn. I am thinking of going back to school. After all, I want my wife to think I’m intelligent.  I ask myself if I’m in the spiritual place with God that I want to be. Do I attend church every week? Do I read the Bible each day? Am I asking more from God than I am thanking Him during prayer? Am I a good example for others and am I teaching them about God? After all, I hope my future wife and I can pray together and maybe take a leadership role in a youth group.  I ask myself, am I happy as an individual? A relationship can bring happiness and fill the void of being alone, but should I put that burden on my future wife? If you are comfortable being yourself, being happy alone and don’t need someone, that is a step in the right direction. I believe that needing someone to fill a void and wanting someone to fill a void are two entirely different things. This is why your relationships begin with you. After all, if you don’t love yourself, then how do you expect someone else to?   When you fulfill the above aspects of your life to an acceptable extent - then watch out, your future spouse may just be at the local bookstore, in the gym, at church, at work, at school, or at the bank. I don’t expect to be able to accomplish each of these things in the next four years, but I will always strive to do so. After all, I hope she will always strive to do the same. And most of all, I hope we will continue to strive to do these things together!  © Chad J. Bring

        God In The Clouds:   "In the Bible, clouds are always associated with God. Clouds are the sorrows, suffering, or providential circumstances, within or without our personal lives, which actually seem to contradict the sovereignty of God. Yet it is though these very clouds that the Spirit of God is teaching us how to walk by faith. They are a sign that God is there."  (Steven Curtis Chapman)  It was a cool August night during the Summer before my Junior year in high school. I was just getting off work on what seemed to be the worst day of my life. I was having a mental break-down, nothing was going right, and every negative thing in my life seemed to hit me at once.   The clock in my truck read 2:13am as I pulled into my high school parking lot that I do so often to take time to think. I laid in the back of the truck and look up at the beautiful stars and clouds. What seemed like forever, I was just talking and praying. I was praying that my life would get better and I kept asking God why He was doing this with my life. I am a Christian, I should have a great life, but it seemed to me, that He wasn't listening. I screamed, "God where are you?"   My eyes began to focus on different cloud formations. First I saw what looked like music notes and then I saw what looked like two people hugging. Then  the last formation that I saw I will never forget, my eyes fixed on a formation of Jesus praying. Just then, my ears focused on the song that had been playing on the tape player. The song called  urlLink "Sometimes He Comes In The Clouds"  by Steven Curtis Chapman. The lyrics that I heard at that moment were;    "Sometimes He comes in the clouds, sometimes His face cannot be found, sometimes the sky is dark and gray, but some things can only be known, and sometimes our faith can only grow, where we can't see, so, sometimes He comes in the clouds. Sometimes He comes in the rain, and we question the pain. And wonder why God can seem so far away, but time will show us, He was right there with us..."   That was the greatest moment in my life, and I will never forget it. I have such a love for life and I find such a joy in helping others enjoy life. Those clouds that night, were the spirit of God teaching me how to walk by faith, they reminded me that God is there. It is the greatest feeling in the world to know that God is with you always, even though it may seem like He is far away. Since then, I have never seen a cloud, without thinking about Him or that cool August night.

      i built another temple to a stranger i gave away my heart to the rushing wind i set my course to run right into danger i sought the company of fools instead of friends  you know i've been unfaithful with lovers in lines while you're turning over tables with the rage of a jealous kind i chose the gallows to the aisle thought that love would never find hanging ropes will never keep you and your love of a jealous kind love of a jealous kind  tryin' to jump away from rock that keeps on spreading solace in the shift of the sinking sand  i'd rather feel the pain all too familiar than be broken by a lover i don't understand  'cause i don't understand  love of a jealous kind, yeah love of a jealous kind love of a jealous kind  one hundred other lovers, more, one hundred other altars if i should slow my pace and finally subject me to grace and love that shames the wise betrays the hearts deceit and lies and breaks the back of foolish pride
