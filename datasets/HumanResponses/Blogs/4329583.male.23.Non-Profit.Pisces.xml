       It's amazing what some people will do for fun and excitement. Although, in telling about this I incriminate myself. But anyway.  So we all (a group of people...I guess as opposed to dogs, cats, aliens, or rubber duckies) decided we wanted to take a walk along the canal. However, the weather decided it was going to rain at the same time. Now, rain would usually stop a sane person from taking a walk outside, but no...no one ever said we were sane. So we walked...in the rain and lightning and thunder...with umbrellas held high...all in the name of fun (and, oh yeah...exercise).  My official battle cry was, "It's just water."  Hmm...it's a shame we don't go out and play in the rain more.

         One Sunday morning, a mother went in to wake her son and tell him it was time to get ready for church, to which he replied, "I'm not going."  "Why not?" she asked.  "I'll give you two reasons," he said. "One, they don't like me, and two, I don't like them."  His mother replied, "I'll give  you  two good reasons why you  should  go to church. One, you're 54 years old, and two, you're the pastor!"

        A kindergarten teacher gave her class a "show and tell" assignment. Each student was instructed to bring in an object to share with the class that represented their religion.  The first student got up in front of the class and said, "My name is Benjamin and I am Jewish. This is a Star of David."  The second student got up in front of the class and said, "My name is Mary. I'm Catholic, and this is a Rosary."  The third student got up in front of the class and said, "My name is Tommy. I am a Baptist, and this is a casserole."

       Okay, so I decided to start a Blog. I remember a few years back when some friends of mine were doing the "blog thing" and I didn't really care for it. But recently a friend of mine told me I should be keeping a journal of all the craziness that goes on in my life...so here it is.
