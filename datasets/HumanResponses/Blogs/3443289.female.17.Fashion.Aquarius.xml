      Life would be so much simpler if I didn't care about Timmy. Or Steven, Pick one, and life would be easier if I didn't care about one of them. BLAH! I have the mental capacity of a dislexic fruitfly, how do they, whoever 'they' may be, expect me to deal with caring so much about two very different boys? AH! I hate the world. Bad world. What difference deos it make? I'm going to die soon anyway. Seriously. Bonnie and Charley are coming to get me. If one doesn't finish the job, the other will. And what's funnier, is that there had been very little news coverage on them. Is no one but me taking the fact that there are two potential hurricanes whirling towards our little city, one due to hit Thursday, and the other following shortly after on Saturday!!!!?? What' wrong with you people?? We're going to die dude. I WANNA GO HOME!! WAH!!! Enough whining. Blah. I'm going to go clean something, or something. Plu. How'd it go, Melmo?

      Update: Timmy can be a bit of a brat sometimes; he often needs a nice beating to get things out of him.

      Talking to Timmy. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than I talk to Steven. I am inclined to worry.  So, Let's break it down: Steven is very secure; He has routine, he has firm beliefs, strong conservative values, we're in a relationship, has shown no sign of mental instability, has great parents, he plays piano, drums, xylothingies, and sings, he's just the type of guy you could marry.  Timmy is very interesting; He has no routine, talks to me continuously, has a firm catholic foundation, he's always nice to me, he almost always listens to me, he almost always tells me everything, we have fun together, may be a little depressed sometimes, takes orders really well.  So I can have the concrete relationship, or the more emotionally involved relationship. 11 45, still talking to Timmy, on the phone now. Hmmm...not 4 AM yet, but we've gone till 6, so we'll see.  But everyone has their negatives, so let's see...     Steven is insecure with relationships; He needs constant reassurance, always seems to schedule our phone calls, however unintentional, can make me feel like a space on his unending list of things to do, the routine thing can get very old sometimes, often doesn't have enough time to waste on me.     Timmy makes me worry; and he keeps me up late. (ok, so I don't mind the late part so much)  Geez, where will this end!!!!  I give up, I'm yours, Toby...no? Sadness.

      Have you ever been to the DMV? There are so many trashy people there. I was sitting in my seat, waiting, waiting, waiting, looking around, and I had to start praying. *crosses self* These too ladies behind me were bitching about what an inconvenience it was for them to have to pay to reinstate their licences after waiting out there suspension for DUI. *Oh sadness* People Effing frighten me. I thought I was hick, but then I went to the DMV. What's worse is that all I got out of it was a photo ID. I don't even get to drive. *more sadnesses*  Anyway, after my world-crumbling DMV experience, my mom took me bowling. It would have been fun had I gotten a score higher than an 85. That's better than my second game with a score of 58. I suck at life. I feel so incompetent. Compared to Timmy, of course, who regularly averages a 220. Blah.  So I've gotten a new favorite singer. YAY!! NO MORE BRITNEY!!! For a few years anyway... i had heard a few things by this kid, and I thought he was good, but recently I've found that, not only is he nice to stare at for hours on end, he's also a good singer/songer writer, and I'm southern, so I'm allowed. Yes, it's true, I like country music. Even more sadnesses. I am a pathetic, southern, hick, and I'm not going to hide it anymore. But seriously, even if you don't like country, you just have to find a good picture of Toby Keith and see what I mean. He's soooooooooo frickin' cute! AH!  So it's now official. I am officially a Republican. I pre-registered to vote today while at the DMV. Did you know that you can do that? I didn't. So I'm all pre-registered n'at now. Yayness and smiles!!  So...onto my whine of the day... ...So I'm sitting in the DMV and these really icky looking people walk in. Usually I'm not one to judge people, but they scared the hell out of me. I tried not to look, because I didn't want any trouble. No one deserves to be judged, and I'm sure they were nice people, and the one girl would have been gorgeous if she'd just brush her hair, her teeth, maybe took a shower. I don't get it. Why do people act like that? It's one thing to be a welfare baby, a druggy, a poor excuse for an American citizen, but you don't actually have to look like one. And then there are those that don't want to be judged by their appearence. Don't appear to be a thug and I won't assume you to be one. I'm not trying to be a super-conformist fascist, but maybe that's what this country needs! Honestly! I am now deathly afraid of the DMV. EEW, germs...I need another bath. *germiness*

      So, Steven and I went on a nice 40 minute break today. Meanwhile, after he went to bed, Timmy and I talked from 10 30 - 12 on the phone, we usually talk all night long on the internet. I've often thought that I could leave Steven and establish a relationship with Timmy, but Steven and I have gone on two short breaks, the first of which was 4 hours, and both times I feel like I want to be with him. Even when he turns into a bit of a baby and worries too much, I still love him. Yet there is still that lingering bit of emotion I have for Timmy, I just wish that I could interpret it. What's even worse is that now there's a third party involved. She's been around for some time, longer than both of the boys, I can't figure her out. Are we lesbians, or are we straight? You can't deny love, Mel. (KIDDING!) :)

      So a family is sitting around at a dinner table when the youngest daughter reaches for her pork chop. The step father, knowing of her daughter's strong aversion to food, says, "Damn, that pork chop has more fat on it than you do!"  And they said I was being dramatic when I didn't want to finish my dinner. Maybe that's because I spent most of high school on 500 calorie a day diets so that they would knock the fat jokes. Guess that was wasted time. I never liked food anyway.
