       Salam,  Sometimes, I wish I wouldnt assume. and I wish I wouldnt say rash things. and that, instead of critisising others, I should critisise myself. Anyhow, Im listening to Al Muallim CD now, and the nasheed applied to how I was feeling. I sometimes wish I could have the manners of the companions of the prophet. They had the perfect example with them.    'He (Muhammad PBUH) taught us to be  just  and  kind  And to feed the poor and hungry, Help the wayfarer and the orphan child And to not be cruel and miserly,  His  speech was soft and gentle , Like a mother stroking her child, His mercy and compassion,  Were most radiant when he smiled  Abal Qasim  Ya Habibi ya Muhammad  Ya Shafi'i ya Muhammad  Khayru khalqillahi Muhammad '   Al Muallim - Sami Yusuf © 2003 Awakening

       Salam,   I hate the weather right now. It’s really hot on the daytime so&nbsp;I don’t feel like doing anything. I’m starting to miss school, not the exams, but seeing my friend’s everyday. Everyone I know is either already on holiday, or going to go.   One of my school friends called me up cos she really really needed to talk, so she’s like come on over, so then I went over to her house, at first I guess we didn’t talk anything 'serious' and as soon as I think we did, my mum called my phone, but I didn’t get to it in time so it came as a missed call, she then called my friends house phone and my friend passed the phone to me. I was expecting her to say something like ‘come home’ but instead she’s like ‘ Maryam’s come down from oxford and she’s waiting for you at the mosque’, so I was like ‘umm ok’ so then she asked ‘are you going to go meet her’, am like ‘obviously, cant keep her waiting’.   So then I apologized to my friend and made an appointment to meet her&nbsp;on tuesday&nbsp;to ‘talk’.   Maryam’s changed a lot. Appearance wise, her pregnancy shows on her now. I spent 3 hours yesterday sitting in an empty Masjid talking. I don’t how I managed to talk so much, but topics ranged from Baby names (duh), University and Homeland :vomit:   One thing I deduced from talking to Maryam: My Algerian sucks. Arabic I can do, English (well duh) but I need to work on my Algerian. It doesn’t help when people from different cities to the one you’re originally from use words you haven’t heard in your life, or when they switch to French (Like hi, I don’t know French).&nbsp; &nbsp;The topic of Boarding at University came up, and surprisingly, Maryam shares my view. Girls SHOULD be able to board. We can be trusted more than guys. Funnily enough, when I checked Islamica, there was a topic about it, and as usual you got Jerks who completely rule out the idea of a girl boarding yet at the same time offer no solution to the problem of university being far away. Their ideal is that a woman stays at home. Bullshit.   Just like I made the choice to go to a mixed Sixth form college rather than a private girls one, not because of the guys :rolleyes:, but because the mixed school had the right environment for me to work in, and I didn’t want to be stuck with a majority of English girls. &nbsp;When the time comes, and I have to choose a university, if I think a university which I wouldn’t be able to commute to was the best place of study for me then I will argue it out until I’m allowed to go. If my parents refuse because I’m a girl (my brothers both board) and it’s a mixed environment at University, then that actually shows the level of trust they have in me. &nbsp;I think, and my friend agrees with me, that being a girl can be trusted more than a guy. Especially a Muslim girl, and even more a Hijabi Muslim girl. That’s because as Muslims, we know our boundaries, and as a Hijabi I know I’ll be (and I am on a daily basis) representing my religion as soon as I step foot out of the house. Therefore, in simple terms, I can’t afford to mess up.   And even if it wasn’t a case of representing my religion, do Muslim parents who refuse their daughters to board at Universities have a doubt in their daughters’ Islamic upbringing? &nbsp;   Don’t they as parents have a responsibility as parents to show their children right from wrong? Shouldn’t their children be past the stage that their parents have to tell them ‘this is right, this is wrong’?   Parents who refuse their daughters boarding are either:   a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overprotective  b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guilty of not carrying out the procedures for a correct upbringing or  c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Both.   Moving along, I talked to an American friend of mine. Its fun to have a conversation with her, I repeat everything really slooooowly. Sometimes I wonder if my ‘British accent’ is really so hard to understand, that she can’t make out ‘what did you do today’ unless I say each word separately and sound out all the letters.   Haha so I read over my post, and I must have written ‘girls should be able to board’ like 10 times. Saddo.   And I forgot to mention, I shouldn't assume. My older Brother is going to JIMAS (though apparently&nbsp;he didnt know Sh. Hamza Yusuf was gonna be there). Its too late to book tickets, and he's going with a bunch of his friends. He says next year,&nbsp;inshallah, he'll take me.&nbsp;Yay.&nbsp;   Okies, I’m out.   Fi Amani Allah wasalam.

       Salam,   I'm not really in a mood to talk to anyone right now, not to say that isn't the norm for me, but today its even more so. I feel drained without having done anything of major importance, I'd planned to meet up with an old friend of mine but forgot totally to call her up and confirm. I remembered at like 1 am yesterday and by then it was too late. Oh well.   Today was weird, my dads away so we got to sleep in way later than usual, the place was a mess and I came down at about 12ish and found my mum and sisters watching TV. My mum surprises me sometimes. Afterwards I guess she reckoned we'd had too much of a lax system and set us all chores.   My mum went out today to visit a guy whose in hospital's mum. The guy got pretty beat up and is now in a coma. I just found out today that he's my friend's fiancé. I felt so bad, I mean I knew there was a guy in hospital in a bad condition but I didn't know who it was and I guess I didn't care a lot. Apparently am pretty heartless now or so I’ve been told. Oh well, who cares, right? When I used to care about everything, it only led me to being hurt and accepting it for ‘mercy's sake’.   Moving on, I’m going to Email Prof. Tariq Ramadan sometime, I doubt he'll reply, but I made some points to ask but didn't get a chance to during the conference on Monday.   Talking of conferences, I think I should try and go to more. I ended up learning a lot, and although beforehand Id thought they would be boring (Secretly) they actually weren't. Well, apart from the talks from people sponsoring. Like I think they were meant to be refreshers or short breaks, but I was thinking 'Please get offstage already'. Uuuugh.   With Monday's one, after I heard Sh. Qaradawi and Prof. Tariq Ramadan, I wasn’t really interested anymore, because that's who I went for. That sounds bad but whatever.   I want to go JIMAS now, but my mum was like 'I'm not leaving you to go all the way to Leicester by yourself, besides you need a Mahrem'. My only Mahrems are my dad and two brothers. I hardly see my dad because he's either out working or in the house (working). My older bro wouldn't agree to go to JIMAS because Sh. Hamza Yusuf is there and he's been brainwashed to think Sh. Hamza Yusuf isn't good enough or something.   My other brother hasn't talked to me for like a month now. So bye JIMAS. I can't go. Oh well.   I saw like 20 minutes of Kill Bill today, hence the title..its from the song at the beginning:   Bang Bang, He shot me down  Bang Bang, I hit the ground  Bang Bang, that awful sound  Bang Bang, My baby shot me down   I don't think Ill watch anymore. I'm not into violent movies.   Oh I was just having a txt conversation with Hum, there you go, I mentioned you. &nbsp;  Fi amani allah wasalam.

       Assalamu alaikum,  After weeks of sun and heat, a day of rain and thunder.    Subhana allathi Yusabihu al ra'du bi hamdihi wal malaikatu min kheefatihi         Glory be to the one whom the thunder celebrates His praise, and the angels (too) for fear of Him   Its been a hard day, I wish life didnt have to be complicated, and that we didnt have to make hard decisions.      Hasbiya allahu wa ni'mal-wakeel        Allah is sufficient for me and is the best one to put trust in.  Fi amani allah wasalam.
