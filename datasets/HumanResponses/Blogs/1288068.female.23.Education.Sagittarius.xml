      Despite random lectures and other disjointed bits and pieces, tomorrow is to all intents and purposes our last day. At the moment I just feel very stressed as my folder is a big fat mess and I am looking at a long night of crazy before the morning of HOORAH! The other big ol' pisser is that I have to go to a flinging reps meeting tomorrow. Reps!? Who cares? I wouldn't bother if Barbara wasn't the chairman.  But never mind that just now:  TODAY WAS MY LAST EVER EVER EVER LESSON AS A STUDENT TEACHER.  There are many, myself included who thought this day would never come.   I am summoning the strength of ten tigers for one last time ... grrr!  Right then.

      Some really good things happened in London and environs today. And some horrid things too.   A couple of lovely things:  The li'l tykes had their exams today , meaning that I didn't have to teach AT ALL. Which in turn means that I have finished my KS3 essay, although it is unmitigated shite. Some kids were vaguely perturbed that I am leaving. Aw. Nice things happened to good people.   And the not so lovely:  I got myself all upset and befuddled about the Summer. I literally had six days left unaccounted for such was my workload. After seeking advice from, well, everyone, I decided to pull out at short notice from the summer work I got ages ago. Meaning that the people involved now hate me. Justifiably, given that I've dropped them in the shit a bit. The teacher who asked me to do it in the first place is v v angry at me. *sobs pathetically*  This is nothing to get upset about, right? So I've pissed off a few people I'll never see again after tomorrow. It is difficult to be a let down. But! I have cleared a full three weeks of my schedule. Am so so relieved.  TOMORROW IS MY LAST DAY IN MY PLACEMENT SCHOOL.

      Oh. Sweet. Jesus.  Tonight, four periods tomorrow, and Wednesday night.  This is all the time I have left to sort out my file, write my essay and write my CEDP.   Three things, three blocks of time. Well, that works out! Time for some serious chunking down, I reckon.  Grrrr! *grits teeth and fists*

      It is completely uncivilised to be out of bed before 9am on a Sunday morning. But there are essays and other important things to be done. It is too depressing. In my Western Isles childhood, this would've been blasphemy.  But! Let's look at some stats to up morale a bit:   TWO DAYS of school left.  Thanks to training day at New Job tomorrow. Eep!   FOUR DAYS until big official last hand in  With Friday being what Rob rather charmingly terms 'a buffer day'. This isn't entirely good news.   THE WHOLE OF JULY  Is given as a grace period to finish taking our Skills Tests. Yay!   EVERY BAR IN LONDON  is at my disposal from Thursday onward. Note to self: drinking to excess is neither big nor clever.  Right then. I suppose I'd better get on with it. x  ETA: Oh for the love ... it is now almost eight thirty AT NIGHT and I have done nothing. Literally. Think of what I could have achieved in the last twelve hours. Bloody hell. I am a big fat failure. Thankfully there is still Pimm's, so I am less concerned about this than perhaps I should be.  Dammit it IS the bloody Calvinists! That or the fact that I am bone idle. *gibbers*

      Oh dear, there is so much work to do and yet I'm not doing any.  Rather, I am wiggling my feet around to Benny Goodman and His Swingin' Band and considering whether I need to buy more yarn to finish this lacy number I am knitting. We also have Pimms, thanks to online impulse-grocery-shopping.  I seem to have turned into my grandmother.  What is to become of me? Come on!

      Is it just me, or was that the longest week in recorded history? It just seemed to go on and on.  Still wibbling, but dealing with it the only way I know: by getting my hair cut. Long time viewers will recall that I don't really like getting my hair cut due to the painful hour-long conversation with the stylist that it entails, but in this case I'll talk about pretty much anything to get the coconut shampoo and the head massage. Anyway, that's happening tomorrow.  We are having potatoes and wine for dinner. Culinary genius!

       Attn: Friends, family, lovers, children of PGCEers   It is too much. There is too much to do and too little time to do it in.  We are tired and cranky.  We haven't stopped since September.  Children shout at us all day and we shout at them and then we shout at you.  We are incapable of thinking of anything except Fuckarses of Standards and KS3 essays and WHAT IS A CEDP ANYWAY?!  We are sorry and we love and need you all if we are going to get to the end.  It is nearly over. We will all be back to normal soon, I promise.  We might even say or do nice things and not talk about teaching for a day or two.  Kisses and apologies in advance. x

      Sigh. Still no keys and a punnet of little Year 7 boys told me that there's been a wave of teacher-key-stealings of late. Ah well.   Collective nouns for teenagers:   A punnet of Year 7s A query of Year 8s A gob of Year 9s A wibble of Year 10s A fag of Year 12s A pout of Year 13s  There is no collective noun for Year 11. They are solitary creatures.  Pip pip! x

      Today some mean kids stole my keys. Am I SUCH a horrid teacher? I never got 'em back so I'm damned to stand outside of classrooms for the next fortnight. Hmph.  Chris gave me a voucher for iTunes music store. I just can't stop buying tracks!  It is late and I am tired. Goodnight! x

      Woo! I am in the midst of a mindbending standards marathon. Have got three pages-worth so far. Only another  -  bastard!  -  three to go. Can anyone think of a way I can prove that I respect children and am concerned about their learning?* Hm.  In related news, why don't you go on over to the copyright-hell that is my  urlLink online gallery  and marvel at Peter and his miniassociates?  My fingers are fine now, thanks. Do be careful when you are washing glasses, though.  Two weeks left! x  * Imagine if there were special government agents whose job it was to compile an  anti-standards  file. And they had photographic evidence of me disrespecting children and not giving a shit about their learning. And drinking too much. And making up lessons as I go along. Or don't.

      Hooray! The boy is home from Cannes with a vague tan and tales of corporate cash-spunking that would make you cry if it weren't so damned funny. I'm sure he will post pictures over on  urlLink his blog  sometime soon. Perhaps when I stop hogging the internet connection.  This afternoon we have been doing some pyjama-dancing to the frankly unnerving  urlLink Rodeohead  and buying tracks for 79p on the amazing new iTunes Music Store. You should get iTunes! It rocks hard.  We are having Sainsbury's moussaka for tea.  That is all.

      Oh dear. Carla is coming next week. She wants to see all of my files. Like, ALL of them. Yes, even that one. No, I don't know what I'm going to do either.  The other thing is that I got my contract for my job, which is great, but requires all sorts of documentation and form filling and police checking and I just don't quite feel like doing that just yet. My brain is locking down and bracing for impact. Jesus.  So the Boy called from Cannes a few hours ago. Apparently it is hot and the hotel is nice, although they were 'treating' the journalists to a big screen viewing of the football, rendering the poor bugger mute and glassy eyed for a couple of hours. I tried to encourage him to get excited by the running around and cheering; perhaps he entered into the spirit of things later on. Perhaps he is glassing some French people as we speak.  The exhibition business went off alright, considering. Good crisp selection. Jon, Rob and I turned up about two hours early to talk to the external examiner. No one else did  -  we are fools. Nothing else of note happened.  I have work to do for school tomorrow, but I feel I should be making the most of a night of singledom. At the moment I am having a floor picnic of cream crackers and cherries and drinking unfiltered water from a paper cup. Woo! I am clearly the most decadent and wanton lady south of the river. Next I think I will practice maudlin ballads on my guitar and experiment with my SHINY NEW CAPO.*  If you are bored at about 2am tonight, feel free to email or AIM or text me, as this is the hour timetabled for extensive wibbling over burglars/monsters/wiggins.  Bye now! x  *Boring guitar-spod interlude:  I got a new capo which is probably totally normal but utterly new fangled and futuristic for me as I have been using a pencil and bit of string for frigging years. Anyway, it is one of those springy metal clip-on varieties for, you know, quickly changing capo position mid-number (!) but it's actually QUITE RUBBISH. The bottom E never seems to be trapped by the capo. Am I doing something wrong? Does anyone else have one of these capos? Does it make all of your capo playing out of tune? Am I putting it on upside down? It was about Â£12, which I think isn't THAT cheap for a glorified clothes peg, really. Should I upgrade? Do these questions sound slightly rude for non-guitarists? HELP ME.  Also, if you have any good tab recommendations, do share: all of my books are Up North.

      The last two days have been spent on my knees, sweating and swearing like a woman possessed. For normal people, the word 'exhibition' conjures up an image of a clean white room and aesthetically stimulating artistic treats to drink wine in front of whilst nodding at a man in a cravat. For we grubby underachieving art-trained, it is another word for 'sweaty, panicked, sleep-deprived, laborious hell on a stick.'  Um, where was I? Yes. We have been setting up an exhibition of our pupils' work to be assessed by the external examiner. You'd think this would be fairly easy for a bunch of creative types with more sticky fixers than you can shake a metre stick at, but you'd be wrong  -  factoring in extreme exhaustion and greenhouse-level temperatures, we all became very slow and ham-fisted. Works were hung squint, boards fell off walls, portfolios were sticky-fixered to the floor and strops were had all over the place. Sigh.  Never mind. It's all over now and they are assessing as we speak. I'm sure it will be fine, assuming the spray mount hasn't given up the ghost entirely. The private view is tomorrow, which should be fun. Wish I had invited more people.  The most anti-climactic thing about all these exhibiting, interviewing and skills-getting achievements is that it is STILL not over. Jesus. Back to school tomorrow. Next on my agenda are standards and files and the KS3 essay, which is like the promised land of PGCE course work. Starting to doubt I will ever see it.  How many days left in the sidebar..?  x

      I'm not sure if it has to do with being brought up in a city battered by North Sea gusts or with just being a miserable sod, but I  hate  this hot weather. I am sticky and cranky and no matter how much weight I drop, I will never look like anything but a cartoon ham in summery clothes.  I guess I'll just have to sweat it out (literally) until the season of coats and scarves and proper tailoring.  Have left Chris at the Tate Modern drinking tea and come home to do my concerfuckingtina book. I have no idea where to begin. Current plan: find as many pictures as possible then print 'em out at A4. Stick down. Fold. Will that do? Also have resource board to make. Bugger.  Sport is happening on television. That is all I know about that.  Had row with Chris because he thinks I should phone all the PGCE people since Babs told me to make sure they all know that we start at nine tomorrow. But I can't be assed. I am crap rep but I don't care.  Goodbye x

      Oh dear. Everyone is having a go at me for being completely underwhelmed about job. I'm sorry. I am happy and relieved, yes. I am just slightly terrified and feel like I've just condemned myself to work like a fucking Trojan for another year. Plus it has all happened so suddenly that my poor addled synapses are stuggling to relay the information to my facial muscles and speech centres. I am squeeing inside, I promise.   Underenthusing with Mags McR   Guess what I've got, Mum?   A cat?   No, a job!   A JOB! But you haven't even done an interview!   Yes, I did one yesterday *outlines events*   Oh. Why didn't they want the other applicants?   I don't know ... maybe they were crap or something, it doesn't matter reallly.   Yes I suppose. But where will you stay?   Probably just in New Cross. I can get a train from here no problem.   *doubtful noise* Hm. I just don't want you getting mugged on the way home or anything. You know. And what about Chris' work?   Well if we stay in New Cross, it won't be a problem, will it?   Well ... and is it a  nice  school?   *losing patience* Well apart from the rival knife gangs and crack addled playground whores, yes it's lovely.   Yes, well that's good then. I'm just going to cut the grass. Write your grandad!   Yes I will. Bye Mum!   *shouts in the background* Ian! Where's the cat? Get her out of there! What? Okay then. Bye!   *click brrrrrrrrrrrrrr*  Sigh. Meanwhile, I am trying to summon up some energy for the final lap of the PGCE derby. Jesus. I still have the concerfuckingtina book to do, along with my two resource boards (might just do one) and getting my files back in order. Mr Bird, do we have to submit our files during the exhibition? If so I am utterly buggered as I have dismantled them to put in my folio.  OH SHIT WE ARE MEANT TO MOUNT LESSON PLANS TOO. I had forgotten. I also have to do the KS3 essay (yes, that one is still dragging on) and this really weird internet thing that I don't understand at all. And don't even talk to me about professional portfolios. Mine is non-existent.   O God! O Jesus Christ!   At least am not being burned alive in pagan ceremony while Britt Ekland takes her bra off.

      Come! Gaze in awe at my numerical genius! Truly I am the mightiest at the 7 times table! Would you like me to calculate anything for you now? Tax rebate? Monthly expenditure? Percentage of your pupils achieving grade 3 or above? *sigh*  So yeah, I'm not sure what happened, but I passed maths despite NEVER having passed ANY of the practice tests. Hooray! I now have a piece of paper verifying my numeracy skillz and plan on having it tattooed on my arse so that I never have to do another test ever ever again.  I also passed ICT which was surprisingly hard. Was so excited I almost asked to take literacy then and there since they weren't that busy, but thought I was pushing my luck enough for one day. Woo!   I met lots of people from other courses and things. Lots of them seemed really het up about the whole business  -  calm down guys! You can take it again if you fail! One girl freaked out during her mental arithmetic test and started crying. Jesus.  I am knackered. Only three days before a luxury two days off and two days bitching about the injustice of it all back at college. Do you like my 'days' counter in the sidebar? I know the ad is quite ugly, but I like that I can know the number of days left at a glance. Also, the ads are for Henry's Cat at the mo, which makes me laugh.  I am going now. I promise never to brag about numeracy ever again. x

      When I was a kid I had a  Henry's Cat  mug with the above motto on it which I hold true to this day. The motto, I mean. I'm not sure what is more disturbing; that I take advice from a piece of cheap-ass ceramic emblazoned with a long-defunct cartoon character, or the fact that I choose to boast about it.  The upshot of this is that I came straight home from school at 3.30pm and went directly to bed. Fully clothed. Which part of the day would you like me to whinge about first?  How about that DT girl got a job at my school and is strutting about like the teaching prodigy she is, making friends with the staff, talking about next term and about how 'everything's all serious now'. Yeah, because it wasn't before.  Or perhaps that  urlLink that Rob  is right. There are no jobs. None. There are jobs in Edinburgh! But no, no jobs to be had in London town. Am applying for things in Kent which is all hassley because of the boy's work. Otherwise quite good because of well-behaved children, leafy surroundings and affordable property. But still.  OR there is always the near-hysteria that accompanies my skills tests tomorrow morning. I am taking the well-worn revision route of 'If I don't know it by now ...' Always a winner.  And finally, in a heartwarming Newsround moment, my HoD stormed into my lesson today and gave everyone a bollocking for making far too much noise. Shit.  Yes, I know that none of this is entertaining reading. And I know that all of it is better than war, death, famine, divorce or a poke in the eye. But I am still wound up and frankly it's better to post here than to lay it on Christophe when he gets home. Poor old thing.  In other news: ARE YOU COMING TO OUR EXHIBITION? I HAVE NO ONE COMING! YOU CAN BE MY GUEST! Well, Chris might come, or he might be in Cannes. But you should come anyway. THERE IS WINE.

      The boy did indeed rescue me from the BIGGEST MOTHERFREAKING WIGGIN this side of the river. It was about to use its horrid pincery wigginy ass to take a chunk out of my foot and he manfully captured it in an ingenious trap made only from an iBook and a jar of houmous. Gra would have used a shoe to mash it nauseatingly but reassuringly into the bedclothes, but not the boy; he is a veritable patron saint to all wiggins. It is in the bin now, feasting on chickpeas and slowly suffocating to death. Soon it will fall into a painless garlic-scented sleep, never to wake. Damned dirty wiggins.  The only good thing about this incident is that it allowed me to say wiggin every hour on the hour for an entire day.  I have my TTA skills tests in ICT and numeracy on Tuesday. It will be nothing short of a miracle if I pass, considering I am almost completely innumerate. Seriously. You don't believe me, do you? Care to make it interesting? My spell checker says that 'innumerate' doesn't exist, which ain't great news for my literacy test. Wonderful.  I have taken v trippy Lemsip Non Drowsy Sinus Capsule analgesic. Now I can't get  Surrey with a Fringe on Top  out of my head. Wouldn't be so bad if I knew the words. Currently goes    Chicks and beans and ducks better hurry When I get you out in my scurry  Wiggin get you out in my scurry With the THING on top   But changes every thirty minutes or so. Nice. Chris fairly stoic in the face of nasally-intoned Broadway hits.  I think I should go to bed.   Bugger, back to school tomorrow. Goodnight. x

      ... and you go from sprightly LEGO punter to adenoidal snot monster in the blink of an eye. To be fair, I haven't had a cold this year yet which is a blinkin' miracle, considering.   Three expressions that may or may not be Scottish  Depending on who you ask. I'm sure many Scots would assert that none of the following are Scottish at all, merely the product of my addled mind.   Just now  Are you serving food just now? When did it happen? Just now!  This means 'right now' or 'this instant!' It looks kind of stupid written down, I guess I should try to phase it out. Or  phrase  it out. Ha! Oh dear.   Will we ..?  Will we go for coffee? Will we go to the pub just now and get food later?  I only found out that this was unusual last week ... It isn't a request for precognitive ability; rather an uncouth way of saying 'shall we?' It is trÃ¨s gauche and I apologise to all in retrospect. Will we move on?   Where do you stay?  Yes, I mean live. Screw you sideways.  Well that's everything I can think of at the moment. For the record, Scottish viewers, I was just considering expressions that I use every day, hence the exclusion of 'aye' and 'dinnae' and 'shitebag'.   That is a good one, though.

      Last night we went to a v nice place for dinner. I felt a bit out of place because the bar downstairs was full of the beautiful young people shouting over their music, but the eating bit was much quieter and had exotic continental waiters. It was good. We had wine and coffee and proper whisky with ice.  Today we are up very early because we are going to the Land of Lego. Where Lego is king! Yes, you know, the funny little bricks. That stick together! LEGO!  I wonder if they have a whole section dedicated to 'fours'? Gra and I always used to run out of them. And Lego-man hands. There might be a well full of those.

      Yes, stats fans, the rumours are true; the boy and I have been a  groovy love-thing for four whole years today. Rather shamefully, I forgot for the  second  year in a row. I am so so sorry. So while he has fabulous surprises up his sleeve for tonight and tomorrow, I can only offer this paean to our wildly romantic beginnings.  Note to the squeamish: I'll try not to be too simpering, but I can't promise anything. You might want to skip to the end.   How the boy and I met   or  Things to do in Dundee when you're not dead yet   The boy and I met through a mutual friend the day before Valentine's day in the year of Our Lord 2000. Actually, I needn't have mentioned the year there, since it's 2004 now and if you take away four years of non-marital bliss then the year would be painfully fucking obvious, non? Where was I? Oh yes.  So it was the day before Valentine's and I called Jim to find out if he wanted to go out for a spot of dinner as was our custom on Saturday nights. If you don't know Jim, his real name is Jamie and he is funny and Hobbit-like. He lives in London now and takes my mild obsession with his love life in good humour. Still single, to my knowledge. Come on girls! And guys! No, sorry Jim, that's not helping really. He's 100% straight and as rugged as can be. As a hobbit can be. No, I'll be quiet now.  Anyway, Jim was at The Rat and Parrot which, in the days before the DCA, was the height of sophistication due to the amazing curly fries and mini Twixs. Twixi. BUT! To my horror he had dragged someone else along! His 'friend' Chris. Why? Was I not everything Jim could want in a friend? And more? Was I being ousted by this upstart? Was it because I refused to watch scary films? Or actions films? Yeah, it was definitely about the films.  My irritation was compounded by the fact that I knew of the chap in question and had decided on sight that I didn't like him. He was outgoing and funny and confident and ballsy. He wore clogs to college and didn't give a shit. Instead of trying to hide his male pattern baldness he clipped his hair right to the scalp for all to see. And it looked great. Damn him! But I had to admit he was clever. You have to admire a clever man. In clogs.  That evening, Chris and Jim came back to my flat and watched telly and admired my new sofa. It was amazing  -  huge cushions, comfortable rolling armrests ... what? Yeah, so they wandered off in due course and I thought nothing more of it.  I had decided that the Christopher person wasn't so bad after all. He was actually quite amusing. And given to flattery. And old-fashioned manners.  He called that night and we chatted for a couple of hours. In fact, he called every night for a month. We quickly became a gang o' two, to the understandable chagrin of Jim. Sorry Jim. We shopped, we dined, we drank, we cooked, we sunbathed. We routinely stayed at each other's houses until 5am, chatting and listening to music and watching movies. People spoke, curtains twitched.  It was not until he went away to Milan at Easter that it became blindingly obvious. I was completely mad about him in every way.  On a Sunday evening after he got back, I met him in the deserted town centre when the sun was low in the sky. He gave me  The Penguin Book of Gay Short Stories  in reference to my devotion to  Queer as Folk . We had dinner at the Twin City Cafe, where he hated the chilli and I drank fizzy water instead of still. We held hands in the street afterward.  It was another couple of months before that fateful night in the cold when he gave me his jacket and walked me home. And never left.  Not a day goes by. x

      Thought I would feel more excited about finally reaching this week's deadlines. Hm.  The lecture this afternoon was tortuously slow and badly managed. I sat at the back with the usual suspects eating sugar-free Polos and drawing stick animals. Sally waxed lyrical about Andy's virility and Rob had a guffawing fit somewhere in the middle. I learned absolutely nothing about Career Entry and Development. I don't even feel bad.  Had a few jars in a pub somewhere in Kent for reasons that I still don't fully understand. Also wrote an introduction and essay plan for Jon while feeling slightly spinny; is terrible but I suspect he will use it anyway.  Feel pretty rotten now. Not at my most fabulous or verbose. Despite earlier protestations, I have no intention of going to college tomorrow. I need to go into town and buy some printing ink in exciting 'my turn Miss!' colours. Kids are so easily amused  -  a tube of pearlescent acrylic reduced my Year 7 group to blithering fools a couple of months ago.*  Barbara came up to me yesterday and whispered 'only four weeks to go, Jenny.' We are buying Barbara organic gin.  I am tired. See you tomorrow you lucky lucky people. x  * Sadly they remained blithering fools for the duration of the term. They should put that on the label really.

      This feels odd. Do I reference no-longer-posts? Do I literally start my online life again, having metaphorically stripped naked and waded into the sea like a virtual Perrin? Perhaps I should assume a new identity and try to trap the boy into a crazy web love affair? With his own girlfriend! That would be fun.  And so to business. *clears throat and intones in newsreel manner*  Today I wrote my entire 'school based action research paper'. Or 'armchair based inaction no-research paper' as it shall henceforth be known. Go me. Tomorrow we are in a lecture. Joy. I wonder what it will be about. Jim is the new new Andy.  It is well past my bedtime. x

      I had a blog. It was good. I wrote every day! I had about 20000 words, which I think is about novel-length. Wow. Sadly, stuff happened, I lost my blog-groove and deleted it all this morning. In many ways it feels good. In other ways it feels freaking awful.  I'm sorry everyone: I'm glad you liked my old blog.  xxx

      It is almost half past four in the morning. I can't get to sleep. I am tormented by visions of handicrafts  -  no, really. First I was thinking about whether or not I should order yarn online, then I was considering possible uses for the pretty woven wire I made whilst watching television. Then I wondered where I could buy more wire to weave and mused for a time on the benefits of magnetic catches. God, it's a sickness.  Now I am online looking at the  urlLink Walsh tools  website, which is like jewellers' porn. Hexagonal triplet loupes, standard pendant motors ... oh yes.  Sweet Jesus, the birds have just started dawn chorusing. I didn't know there  were  birds in New Cross.  In other news, the boy staggered in at half two this morning, almost entirely incoherent. Where the hell did  urlLink you   urlLink lot   go ? I tentatively asked what he ate for dinner and he replied '... vomit'. Oh dear.  Ah well, another thirty five minutes and I can listen to that amazing Danny Boy medley on Radio 4. Yay!*  * I know.

      Today I have to wear clothes that aren't pyjamas and say words in a logical order to make sentences. The reason for this folly? I am going to meet Lucy at  urlLink The National Gallery . Hooray! Lucy works at the gallery as a lecturer, so she got us tickets for the Russian Landscapes exhibition. I hope we get to go to the cafe too.  It is a nice day outside, which always presents me with the problem of What to Wear. When I'm on my own I will happily roam the streets in inappropriately warm clothing such as a scarf, balaclava, fur coat, wellingtons and so on, but it seems more ridiculous somehow when you're in the company of someone who is wearing a strappy vest and sandals. Hm. What? No, you don't have to listen, I was just thinking aloud.  In other news, the boy is going out with his work tonight, leaving me to eat dinner straight from the pan and drink wine until I can't get up. Ah, simple pleasures!  Goodbye.

      Like all Scots-in-exile, I spend many a gin-fuelled evening waxing melancholy about the Old Country; how blue the skies! how pure and life-giving the water! how cheap the property!  Thankfully, I only socialise with people polite enough not to ask why, if it's so bloody great, I don't bugger off back up there. Bless 'em.  Anyway, the boy has now booked tickets for our biannual jaunt North, first to his place on the beautiful  urlLink South coast , then to my parents in the  urlLink Borders .   No, it's not a holiday per se, but it is an excuse to behave like a teenager for a couple of weeks next month. Woo!  In related news, the excellent  urlLink Chris Cope  points out this hot Borders story -    urlLink The Devil, I tell you!

So I was wondering if I had an overdraft facility to use until then?  BANK:  Ha! Are you freaking kidding me? Um, I mean no, there's nothing coming up on the screen here.  JENNY: I see. Well, I was wondering how I could get one?  BANK:  *doubtful pause* Well you see the problem is that there has been no, er,  income  of any kind this year.  JENNY:  No, that's because I've been training, you see. Postgraduate teacher training; I told you about it this time last year. When I was calling about my overdraft, remember?  BANK:  Right. Well do you have a copy of the contract for your new job? If you  really have one , you bloody layabout.  JENNY: Yes! Yes I do! I can fax it to you!  BANK:  Yes, that would help your cause. Can you also give me your contact number?  JENNY:  Yes it's ... 0207 - 73, no 779, no ... actually, can I get back to you on that one?  BANK: Er, yes alright. Goodbye.  Jesus   JENNY: Goodbye!

      We are not going on holiday this year. It's okay, I've come to terms with it. Long time readers will recall that the boy and I have  never  been on holiday, unless you count that time we went camping in Cornwall. And we don't.  The reason we are not going on holiday is that we can't afford it. Yesterday, for the record-breaking 6th summer in a row, I was greeted by the immortal words  AVAILABLE BALANCE: Â£0.00 YOU MAY WITHDRAW: Â£0.00 UNDERSTAND? NOW PISS OFF, LOSER.*  at the cashpoint in Westminster Station. Bugger.  The bank have taken away my overdraft  -  the injustice! I may write an angrily worded letter. Or perhaps just phone them and beg.  Yes, I am feeling sorry for myself. Revolting, isn't it?  But! There are worse places to be stuck. London, for chrissakes! This weekend we have been throwing ourselves wholeheartedly onto the throbbing groin of our great nation. Yesterday we took a boat all the way up the Thames to Kew. Our cheeky Cock-er-nee captain showed us the street where Oscar Wilde lived, Michael Caine's fancy flat, beautiful Battersea Power Station, and the place where all of our rubbish is compacted and put onto barges. That bit made me feel strangely proud  -  that's our rubbish!  We spent the afternoon lying in Kew Gardens, marvelling at sunflowers and bamboo and reading all the dedicated benches.  Today we went to Greenwich, Where Time Begins. It rained on our picnic, but we stayed out like hardened Scotsfolk while all the namby Southerners ran for cover. Grr! After only-slightly-soggy sandwiches we went to the National Maritime Museum and saw menus, tickets and amazing silk slippers from the Titanic.  We are at home now, watching Bill Bryson being diplomatic about Scotland.  Tomorrow I have shitloads of schoolwork to do. Have given up utterly on finding somewhere new to live. All you summer visitors will just have to cope with the mouldy bathroom. At least the slugs have gone.  *In retrospect, I may have imagined that last bit.

      I am in bed again. There is really no reason to get up when you have forgotten to buy  urlLink Crunchy Nut Cornflakes . They really do Taste Too Good.   I checked the  urlLink weather;  today is going to be muggy and hot with 'thundery downpours'. For the love! No sunbathing for me. Unless I want to do that romantic comedy thing of getting caught in a deluge wearing only a thin vintage dress and fancy bra, and then trying to keep my head dry using a newspaper only it doesn't work and my hair falls engagingly around my face in damp curls which are in turn tugged playfully by a sensitive and wistful man walking a Dalmatian who is sheltering under the same tree as me.   Surreal dinner conversation #372    I wish there was more than one way to get married. Like, you know there's more than one way to have a funeral: you can be buried, you can be cremated, you can be put in a cardboard box with an acorn ... I wish weddings were like that.   Yeah. So do they put the acorn in your belly button or just in your hand or what?   I'd love that, to be buried with an acorn, not because it would be really humble and unaffected, but because I can't think of a more egotistical monument  -  A TREE!   Everyone shelter under me! Make way for my roots! Come, squirrels, tiny animals, nest in me!   Yeah, or a fruit bush and everyone could eat a piece of me   I wouldn't be a crappy  fruit bush , I'd want to be A MIGHTY OAK!   A GIANT REDWOOD!   But if we're both really big trees they'll have to bury us really far apart or one tree might strangle the other with its roots.   I could be a tree and you could be a climbing ivy then   Fuck off, I'm not being ivy. You be ivy.

      We have a plague. Of slugs. It is utterly vile. What is the point of slugs? I know that question could be aimed at so many creatures on this fair planet, ourselves included, but ... slugs. If I was a slug I'd sure as hell have serious existentialist issues. Blah. Drunkenly asked the boy last night what he would do if he woke up and saw that I had a slug on my face. He said he'd 'pour salt on it'. I somewhat hysterically informed him that the only thing worse than waking to find a slug on your face is waking to find an oozing, squirming slug dissolving in salt and its own juices on your face. Rest assured; there is now an agreed Slug Procedure should any such event arise.  Last night was fun although I ate and drank far too much and learned more about the internal workings of an IT publishing house than I ever wanted to know. To be fair, Jim let me talk a lot about teaching and wasn't too offended by my over-personal questions and grumpy swearing. We left the bar early-ish as Jim had to deliver a ring and this big eye kept looking at him.  In other news, DO NOT be fooled into buying  Onken Wholegrain Yogurt , no matter how enamoured you are of the other excellent varieties of Onken. Particularly the Mango and Vanilla one ... god, that's delicious. But Just Say No to wholegrain. It may seem like a bit of harmless frippery at first, with its jaunty packaging and promises of barley and oats, but in the end you just feel vaguely sick and disappointed, cursing the day you swore off refined carbohydrates and feeling like all the little live cultures are mocking you and pointing as they reproduce asexually.

      I am overexcited because Jim is coming all the way from the Shire to meet us for drinks in Greenwich. You may recall that the last time we saw him was for the boy's birthday, when we inadvertently offended the mild mannered patrons of a fine Greek establishment in Fitzrovia. Ah, the revelry of youth.  On Friday we had lots of fun at the theatre, not least because we got our seats upgraded to the very fancy dress circle. I used the little binoculars to look very very closely at what the extras were doing during party scenes. Afterwards we walked to a Chinatown restaurant and were served noodles by the Angriest Waitress in London.  Next week, I plan to knit like a bitch, work on school things, look for a new flat and work some more on Hollywood Blockbuster, which is rapidly looking like a post-apocalyptic episode of Hollyoaks written by a wine-addled till-monkey with a Wodehouse complex. Bloody hell.  Greenwich calls. And not a minute too soon.

      Please accept my apologies for my rather maudlin postings of late. There is no excuse.  I have only just woken up. At 12.07pm! Truly I am the queen of decadence!   After my afternoon bath and flatmess stressathon, I am off into town to get tickets for  urlLink Beautiful and Damned  which looks like the inside of my mind made flesh. I suspect this will not help my retro fantasy leanings.  Right then.  Take care.

      On my first day at school I was a bit late but Ms said it was okay as some of the other NQTs were even later anyway. Then they gave me a pain au chocolat which is like a kind of pastry with chocolate in the middle. And a cup of orange juice or water  -  I took water.  Then Ms gave us loads of paper and I had forgotten to bring a notepad so I had to write on the back of my papers but I suppose I can write it all down somewhere better later. We had a tour of the school it was good although some of the children stared at us. They are probably quite nice really I suppose I would stare too if I saw some people I had never seen before in a place that is full of people.  At break we got to go in the 'Staff Room' which is where all the proper teachers go. The teachers were nice except for one teacher who told me off for being in the 'Staff Room' until he realised I was not a Sixth Former. I was scared but I made a joke. The joke was rubbish but he laughed anyway.  Then I had Art, it is my best subject. They put me in a classroom with no other people. I was supposed to sit in the teacher's chair but it felt a bit cheeky so I sat at a pupil desk instead. I looked in some cupboards which were full of jelly moulds and things because they used to teach cooking in the art department. There was no paint or brushes or paper. Or pencils or glue. Or pens. Maybe they are somewhere else.  At the end of the day we had a talk about Pastoral Care, which is about when you have to go to assembly and things. We got biscuits and tea or coffee. I had tea. At the end of the meeting I went outside with a naughty American NQT who wanted to smoke a cigarette but had to do it in secret because it is not allowed in school. I did not smoke a cigarette though.  I went home on the train. I really liked my first day in school, it was good.  Then I woke up and it was all a dream ... or was it?

      I haven't been sleeping well again. Yesterday I tried to tire myself out by doing the Richard Curtis RomCom Walk of Whimsy (patent pending) along Bankside then wandering around the Tate Modern for several hours, but come nightfall I was still wound up and angsty  and suffering from substandard spinal support.*  The result of this is that I slept until about 1.30pm today and have achieved nothing. Ah well.  I have two days of induction at New Job starting tomorrow. Oh no. I don't mind the meetings and tours and so on, but I find the sinister two hours of 'personal planning time' on the timetable somewhat alarming. I suspect this will require me to hang about in the art department getting under everyone's feet and feeling stupid. Is there anything more cringe-inducing than starting a new job?   In other news, I was trying to find a link to the Barclay's ad when I found out that Gary Oldman is from New Cross. I don't know what to do with this information, but I feel it could be Important in some cosmic way.  We are having baked potatoes for tea.  * I genuinely think my head is too heavy for conventional pillows. The boy regularly buys me new and exotic varieties of pillow but within a fortnight they're flat as pancakes again. Does anyone else have a really heavy head? Just me then.

      Today has been spent shouting 'KISS MY FACE!' at the television every time that new Barclays ad with Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldman comes on. It's those glasses. I will never tire of it. Ever.  As well as obsessing over men twice my age, I have been exclaiming over the cuteness of the boy's  urlLink childhood recordings , arguing with my mother and eating far too many evil snackfoods. Bad Jenny.  Last night it rained like a bastard. x

Am struggling to adjust to a world that no longer involves raising my voice to be heard, looking stern, and substituting swearwords for Blytonesque alternatives such as  blimmin', shoot,  and my favourite;  flinging .  In other news, it's That Time of Year when tourist board ads, heather honey, Caledonian Spring, Glasweigan dads cuffing their kids on Westminster Bridge and lard-based bakery products in the supermarket can make me weep like a child for my Up North family.   It has to be soon, before I start moping around the Visit Scotland shop, eating black pudding and singing maudlin ballads and pouring porridge in their desk drawers.  In an unrelated story, the boy got me an amazing MIDI keyboard so I could mess about with the supercool GarageBand application. He seems to suspect I have dormant musical-genius tendencies. Might have a go.  It's not goodbye ... x

      Wouldja take a look at the time? This time last week this would've been a perfectly normal time to be eating Crunchy Nut Cornflakes and getting all wet under the crappy shower but today I feel just wretched. The middle of the frigging night!  Anyhow, I am off to take my literacy test. It will be great to have a piece of paper saying I am literate. I'm sure glad all that exam stressing all those years ago wasn't for nothing. I'd hate to think that the TTA itself was implying, by making me take a half hour pop quiz invigilated by a trained chimp, that it held no stock whatsoever in the QCA and the very exams they are training us to prep kids for.   Forgive me; I am sleepy and cranky. xxx

      Oh dear. As predicted, going from an eighteen hour working day to eight weeks of unfettered freedom has driven me slightly crazy.  Last night did not sleep one wink due to being merely a bit sleepy rather than exhausted to the point of collapse. This was compounded by the boy being mysteriously tired and going immediately to sleep in a very angular and pointy-elbowed way. Was forced to shake him awake several times and demand to discuss the day's hot news topics and/or where would be the best place to live in South London.  Am thinking maybe I should get an Insomniac Messenger Buddy; someone to be on call 24/7 for my conversational amusement just in case I can't sleep.   Yesterday was rubbish. I am sick of this flat with its poky corners and mouldy ceilings. And dust. I had promised myself I wouldn't go out for the day until I had transformed it into a veritable Cif palace, but frankly I couldn't give an arse anymore. I am going out. Behold! My Tate Modern membership card! Wonder! At Â£2.50 for UNLIMITED BUS TRAVEL! I feel I'm rather too excited.

      This week I have charged myself with one of my most loathed duties  -  looking for a new flat. Back in ol' Dundee, this was a case of swapping places with a friend of a friend's sister who'd recently split up with her boyfriend/fallen out with her flatmate/had an illegitimate child with her tutor/delete as applicable. In the Big Smoke it is an epic quest that drags on for months and requires the sort of paperwork and initial cash outlay that could be used in a less pompous region to start a small independent state or breakaway republic.  There is also a kind of selective deafness to the lettings agents I have spoken to:  'Hello! I am looking for a one or two bedroom flat near New Cross station please.'   'Hm. What about a studio in Peckham?'   'Ah, well you see that has no bedrooms and is in Peckham, thus the complete opposite of what I am looking for.'   'Does it need to be furnished?'   'Yes it would be best if it had furniture. Beds, at least.'   Well, there's a place in Nunhead. But there's no furniture. Or shower. Or washing machine. Or roof. Or walls.   'I see. That's not really so much a flat then, is it? More a set of ideals.'  And so it goes on. I wish they would just say 'To be honest we haven't got anything that would suit you.' It would make it so much quicker. Honest estate agents.  Honestate Agents!  A new chain of estate agents that promise to be brutally honest.   Strangely similar to my plan for  Intellidressers , where you can have your hair cut and coloured by a stylist with a masters in criminal psychology. Eschew the conversational world of clubbing for one of forensic evidence! Or astrophysics! Or 18th century French literature! You could request the stylist with the specialist subject of your choice. There must be some disillusioned graduates out there who would love a little comb-holster.  Anyway. I think it is time to tidy up the bedroom.

      Yes I know, it's tragic. All this time to myself, the whole of London at my doorstep, and I'm sitting in the dark blogging. I'm sure everyone else is lounging around in fabulously shabby bars being desirable and louche, but I am just hanging out here, clearing up the debris of a two month long housework embargo.  Am finding it hard to wind down into holiday mode and feel slightly frantic about the various odds and ends that need to be done before September. I think my brain is just looking for some displacement stress; you can't just expect it to stop suddenly like that.  Have spent most of today listening to '30s jazz and considering seaside holiday destinations. Seem to be slipping irretrievably into Wodehousian fantasy in which I have land and a sense of moral outrage.  Miss you x

      Just back from Sainsbury's, where people with no appreciable spacial awareness, motor skills or co-ordination were having some sort of wager on who could drive their trolleys the most spastically into the island merchandising areas. Jesus. No wonder they have to have those funny rubber bumpers in the fresh produce aisle. Additionally, I hereby promise to drop kick the next lucky toddler who runs into my basket at full tilt then dissolves in hysterical tears at my feet as onlookers are scandalised by my flagrant disregard for the wellbeing of fucking hyperactive children who should be handcuffed to their parents, put in the trolley seat provided or tied up outside the shop so help me God.  In more cheerful news, I am intermittently knitting, making cakes and grumbling at length about the state of the house. Hooray! Also: the Emma! The Emma is coming! Not for ages but I am very very very excited!  Being on holiday is great. x

      Once again you find me in bed. How slovenly. I'm not sure what to tell you today. What did I  used  to talk about? I can't remember. Anyway.  Some of you want to know How it All Ended:  We turned up on Thursday to have our files checked and to hand them in for final assessment. Of course, this sounds far simpler than it actually was  -  upon inspection, everyone had things missing which then had to be done at the last minute amidst much stressing and shouting and stropping around. I am ashamed to include myself in that bit.  I think we ended up running about like crazies for about six hours before the hand-in time came round. Then we each checked in our files with Barbara, who gave us a pink slip of paper with our names on. And that was it. Those of us who had finished went to the pub, but we left lots of other comrades behind, typing and photocopying like billy-o  in order to meet the final deadline of 8pm.  I hugged Carla. She was fragrant and huggable. I'm glad we will be seeing her again soon, it wasn't a great way to finish.  Yesterday I paid my fine of Â£16.40 (!) at the library and Lucy gave me a lift home with all my exhibition stuff. Thanks Lucy! She also invented an amazing new drink from the paltry contents of our fridge.  At night, I took Chris to see Shrek 2 at the Empire in Leicester Square. It was great.  I can do whatever I want today! It is too exciting.   Why not indulge me by considering a few PGCE thoughts for one last time:   We still don't know who has passed and who has failed (if anyone) ... angst!  I am an actual, real life teacher.  Carla's bracelets  -  are they the source of her power?  Would we do it again?  Probably.

      I am in bed. Can't really write too much at once ...  People went to the pub. The people were me and Lucy and Jon and Sally and Rob and Hav and Chris. I drank too much gin. It tastes like celery. Sally made puppets happen and said I was a beauty. Hahaha! My legs hurt, I don't know why. My head is really hot too.  I have to go to college soon to pay off my library fine and get my portfolio. Lucy will give me a lift home which is good but oh god our flat is shameful I hope she doesn't want tea because there is no milk. Or cups. Or tea.  I am sad to leave everyone. Being teacher is a bit alarming.  In other news, I would like to announce that for the next two months I am free as a bird. Place your bookings now for shopping, cinemaing, coffeeing, members' lounging and general larking. Woo!  Have a lovely Friday everyone. x

      Good morning.  I'd like to apologise for all the exclamation marks and caps-locking of late. There is no excuse, really.  I got up about half an hour ago because I woke up with all the tunes from School of Rock going round and round on my internal jukebox and because it was hot and irksome lying down. And because the boy was snoring like an adenoidal bandsaw.   touch me baby, ba-ba-ba-baa, Lawrence is good at pia-no! ba-ba-ba HHHNNNNNNRRRRRRRRK HNNNNN HHRRRRRNK   You get the picture.  I'm sure I'll regret getting up so mindlessly early and end up getting all cranky and being sent to my room before dinner, but never mind.

      I am tidying up the flat so that Emma won't think I am a slob. Obviously this is madness as she has known me for over a decade and knows full well the extent of my slobbiness. But I need something to do to stave off the crazy! I am so so excited, not JUST because Emma is coming, but because the boy is on holiday, and we are going to Scotland to have a surprise party with fireworks and cake! And after that I am going to my parents' to eat and drink and torment the cat and be told to shut up by my brother who, to be fair, calls it like he sees it as far as I'm concerned. Hooray!  It feels like a proper summer holiday now.  This post is rubbish but I don't care!  *expresses holiday joy through the medium of interpretative dance*

      Only three weeks 'til school starts.  And the next two weeks have been put aside for larking around. Leaving only ONE WEEK when I get back from Scotland to do preparation. What the hell have I been doing for the last month? I don't know either.  Suppose I'd better do some work then.

      Yesterday I was a gift-buying genius! I went to Hamley's and bought Wee Bead People for Alis' 8th birthday, then I went to the Contemporary Ceramics gallery and bought lovely Japanese stoneware for my in-laws' anniversary,  then  I went and queued for THE LONGEST HOUR OF MY LIFE at Cookson's to buy gold and silver wire for some impromptu jewellery making.   Studying in the wilds of Scotland means that I had never actually been to a bullion merchant before. It was very exciting! Everyone is behind bulletproof glass and the whole place can be secured and inescapable at the touch of a button. Wow. Weirdly, you also have to take a supermarket-style ticket before you can be served, giving the whole thing the air of a nuclear arms deli counter.   Do you think Scotland Yard will knock my door down at 4am for putting 'nuclear arms' in my blog?  This time next week I will be heading North to the land of milk and honey and coronary heart disease. Hooray! Also, the all-translating, all-interpreting, cow-loving, ankle-clicking, floor-sleeping karaoke giant that is Miss Emma is coming to stay on Saturday. This is more exciting than anyone can possibly imagine! I suspect my post on Friday night will consist entirely of exclamation marks.  In other news, the boy has signed us up for a free trial of an amazing DVD rental service where you go online and make a list of films you want to watch and one falls through your letterbox every couple of days. It's great! Also, you end up with bizarre combinations; tonight I have the choice of Schindler's List or School of Rock, for example.  And now I am going to Sainsbury's. x

      We had a problem with our phone that went something like this:   PHONE:  bbrrrrrrrrrrrrt-b-bbrbrrrt-br-rrrp- *wheeze*  ME:  *lifts receiver* Hello?  PHONE:  *eerie silence*  ME:  *replaces phone* Hm.  PHONE:  bbrrrrrrrrt-br-b-brrrrrrrrrrrrr-*splutter*  ME:  WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  After a couple of hours I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, so the boy phoned the Amazing BT Automated Phonechecking Robot. It really was! Amazing, I mean.   The robot finds out what is wrong with your phone through the miracle of fibre optics, then schedules a BT man to come to your house at the crack of dawn the next working day. THEN it diverts your landline to your mobile with no extra charge to you or your callers. It's an innovation in artificial intelligence! Part of a new hyperrace of beings! Switch to BT now before their dark army of Automated Phonecheckers take over the planet!  Right, I think that's enough BT pimping for now. Suffice to say I think you should all stick your phones in buckets of Tizer and call the 'Bot forthwith.*  Now I have to go and write a lesson plan on How to Draw a Portrait. Thrill!  Take care.  *Unless you're not with BT  -  that would be crazy.
