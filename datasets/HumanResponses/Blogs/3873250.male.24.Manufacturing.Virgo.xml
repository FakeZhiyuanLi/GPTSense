      Hey kids, I'm back.&nbsp; It's been a slow week for me to update this thing because it's been a slow week for me in general.&nbsp; Let's just say this:&nbsp; yesterday sucked!&nbsp; It started off just as any other day.&nbsp; No strange occurances, just the usual shower, drive to work, etc.&nbsp; Once I got to work however, life became hell.&nbsp; As I just sat at my desk, minding my own business my allergies decided to organize an uprising against me.&nbsp; Suddenly I was sneezing like a machine gun, my nose ran like a faucet and my eyes burned like a million microscopic matches.&nbsp; I was not pleased.&nbsp; I spent half of my work day in the bathroom blowing my nose, leaving me with Rudolf the Rednosed Reindeer syndrome.&nbsp; This was agony.&nbsp; Just when I thought I was ok, another sneezing fit would come over me or the incomperable river of snot would begin to flow again.&nbsp; So I took twice the recommended medication for allergies.&nbsp; Needless to say after that I was quite sleepy, so when I got home I plopped down on the catch for what I felt was a well deserved nap.&nbsp; Woke up still feeling like crap, so there was really only one thing I could do; I played Spider-Man 2 for the Playstation 2.&nbsp; There's nothing quite like saving civilians and beating the crap out of Mysterio to boost a guy's spirits.&nbsp; After that, I had some caramel popcorn (from Act II, get it at Wal-Mart, it's heaven in a box) and watched the Sopranos.&nbsp; Ah, but what's the better show?&nbsp; Sopranos or the Shield?&nbsp; A question for the ages.&nbsp; I didn't do much else yesterday.&nbsp; It's been a boring week for yours truly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, no news is good news or so they say.&nbsp; &nbsp; One thing of note this week is that it's exactly one week since I came home to the letter telling me that my wife had left me.&nbsp; How do I feel one year later?&nbsp; I feel like a new man.&nbsp; She was bringing me down and I couldn't see it and I've learned to live for me again.&nbsp; I'm the big, bad bastard I once was and then some, but I've also grown as a person and understand the human condition more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp; People ask if I regret having married Amy, but I don't, not at all.&nbsp; It was a learning experience if nothing else and I have to admit that most of the time it was great.&nbsp; Anyway, enough of me being&nbsp;serious. &nbsp; It's time for another trip to Josh's Comic Corner.&nbsp; So far I've only talked about&nbsp;"mature" type superhero&nbsp;books, today I'll talk about a more&nbsp;traditional book,&nbsp;&nbsp;Batman.&nbsp; This is one of those books that everyone you know has read at least one issue of and since they have read that one issue are now an "expert."&nbsp; It's really quite annoying.&nbsp; Now then, that's out of the way.&nbsp; Let's just say right now that Batman as a franchise is entirely sketchy.&nbsp; Some books are crap and some are mediocre, with the occasional title (in this case "Batman") being a stand-out book.&nbsp; Currently being treated more as an in-continuity anthology, Batman sees a new creative team per story arc.&nbsp; This began when Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee started their acclaimed "Hush" story arc.&nbsp; The art was absolutely fantastic and the story was solid with lots of shocks and surprises, but sometimes got caught up in trying to surprise and took you out of the intensity of the story.&nbsp; Personally, I preferred the next story arc featuring the work of Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Rizzo.&nbsp; While not the big, iconic story that "Hush" was, "Broken City" focused more on the elements that I enjoy in a good Batman tale.&nbsp; Batman is the world's greatest detective, he is also fairly ruthless in his treatment of the criminal element and the Azzarello/Rizzo team definately showed the gritty crime-noir side of the Batman mythos and I feel that this is really the characters strength.&nbsp; Currently, Judd Winick (Sound familiar?&nbsp; That's right, it's the guy from the Real World) and Dustin Nguyen are mid-story in an arc that feels somewhat like a mix of the previous two.&nbsp; This should be manna from heaven and not that it isn't a good story, but something just feels, I dunno...off.&nbsp; However, I respect both creators greatly and will wait for the end of the story arc to pass judgement.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Well kids, I'm off for the weekend and I hope everyone has a safe and happy one.&nbsp; I will return Monday and hopefully have done something blog-worthy.&nbsp; I will at least tell another sordid tale of my past, until then... &nbsp;

      Hey kids, I'm back!  I'm over my virus and as far as I can tell I'm no worse for the wear.  While I was sick I found myself watching hours upon hours of absolute crap on the TV.  A prime example is a show on MTV called "Room Raiders."  I'm oddly intrigued by the premise of this show.  A guy or girl is going to choose between 3 members of the opposite sex for a date.  Pretty standard stuff.  Instead of meeting the person and choosing the date the sane way, the person choosing a date gets to inspect the bedrooms of the 3 potential dates to "get to know them."  I realize just how much I hate young people when I watch this show.  All guys are diggin' in the girls panties and all girls say some innanely idiotic thing that bears no relevancy to anything (i.e. "Any guy with a sword hanging over his bed must have commitment issues."  Oh thank you little miss Dr. Phil in a tank top...SHUT UP!)  Guys are just as bad though, a girl owning a thong must immediately mean that she wants some hot, wild sex.  Okay, granted that everyone wants some hot, wild sex, but let's just keep in mind that girls see getting dressed as an art form and that a visible panty line would be a fate worse than death.  I must admit that I really do have to laugh when the girl pulls out a guy's large stack of porn magazines on television.  That's comedy right there.  You reap what you sow, Onan.  Not that there's anything wrong with that mind you, I mean it's proven that something like 98% of guys do it and something like 80% of women, but this is on TV...it's just comical.  Now, I don't want to sound like an elitist here, but I was watching this with a 102 degree temperature and was just frankly without the energy to change the channel, but appearantly there are legions of people in my generation that sincerely want to watch this crap.  Not that I spend alot of time watching CNN or the Discovery Channel, but I need something at least a little bit challenging or possibly even a touch socially aware.  These shows are making our culture retarded!  In twenty years, the idiots that were glued to the television for the junk that MTV is pumping out along with Survivor, Big Brother and the rest will be in charge.  It's frightening to me to think of how this country will be run.  It's screwed up now and the people in charge are marginally intelligent.  Have we run out of fiction?  Are we afraid of challenge?   Have people forgotten how to read?  I dare say that I've read more books in the past six months than three average people combined have read in a year.  I'm not saying that I'm the one that should be in charge because I wouldn't want to be, but hot damn it's looking like it may come down to it.  Okay, that's enough of my ranting.  Welcome back to Josh's Comic Corner.  I'm going to be talking about DC Comics' Starman written by James Robinson with art by Tony Harris among others.  The original Starman was Ted Knight, but this isn't his story, he's an old man at this point.  This is the story of Jack Knight, who has grumblingly taken up the mantle of Starman and carried on the family tradition to avenge his brother David, who was the Starman prior to Jack.  Confused yet?  It's not too complicated.  Jack just wanted to run his pawn shop and live his life, but then someone came after his dad.  To save him, Jack took up the role of Starman.  He's not a tights and cape kinda super hero though.  He wears jeans, a t-shirt and a leather jackets.  He's got 50's style hair (think Elvis) and is covered in tattoos.  So that's his "uniform" along with a pair of goggles and his cosmic rod, which allows him to fly and he can shoot bolts of energy from it.  Jack tends to get caught up in leftover fights from his fathers past, whether it's a former villian's child or the Shade, an ageless villian who's decided to give up his wicked ways...or has he?  It really reads unlike any other comic I've read and that's saying someting.  I'm only 17 issues into the 80 issue run, but so far it's a story about family.  Also a story about finding yourself.  It's really beautifully written and Tony Harris' art is absolutely wonderful.  People's expressions in the book are very bold and powerful.  Harris' compositions jump right off the page with energy.  This is really an underappreciated book and definately one of the ten best books of the nineties.    Well children, I think that's sufficient for today.  Hope you've had a good time and until next time....

      Well kids, I was hoping to have some wild, globe-spanning adventure to tell you about, but I really have nothing to tell you about unless it happened in my bed and sadly, nothing fun and/or interesting happened in my bed except for my fever going up and down.  So, yeah.  I was sick.  I slept alot.  Aren't you envious of my exciting life?  Thought so!  I'm still woozy today and not feeling terribly articulate, so I think I'll just wrap this up.  Adios, amigos....

      Well, if no news is good news, then you kids just hit the jackpot!  Nothing much happened in the wonderful world of Josh yesterday.  A typical day a work followed by hanging out with some friends after.  The YMCA is closed this week, so it's no gym for me and I can feel it.  Perhaps that's been my problem this week.  I've had a ton o' trouble sleeping, I think I got a solid one hour of shut eye last night and I'm blaming lack of exercise.  Ok, in the event that I ramble on incoherantly or perhaps leak the info on the locale of Elvis's summer home, please take my lack of REM cycles into consideration.    Since there's not too much news, I guess it's story time.  Snuggle in boys and girls, it's time for the most amazing thing to ever happen to me.  The year is 1999 and it's a dark and stormy night, and could there be a better setting for a story?  My friend Cam and I had just finished a late night meal at Perkins and were travelling the back roads of Gray, TN so that I could drop Cam off at his car.  If you've never been to east Tennessee, all you really need to know for this story is that the area is very hilly.  On the right side of the road the hill went straight up, on the left side it went straight down.  As I came around a blind curve on this road (I'm driving a Ford Explorer at the time) my headlights hit a pile of what I beleive to be trash about twenty yards ahead of me.  Now for whatever reason, there is male programming on a cellular level telling you that if there is something in the road, you absolutely must accelerate toward it.  I followed my cellular instinct and was rapidly closing the gap between the vehicle and the pile in question.  At about the time I was ten yards from the pile of garbage, I realized that this pile of garbage had a head, legs and arms that were pointing right at me (picture an olympic diver off the high dive, but laying flat in the road, waiting to die).  Well everything registers at once.  I cannot swerve to miss the guy because of the hills on either side...so I accelerate again.  Since the man is "diving" at me, I realize that I've got a shot at pulling this off so I line the Explorer up to try and pass over him.  There is nothing quite like watching a person's body disappear underneath the hood of your car at 35 miles per hour.  Being the dark and stormy night that it was, neither Cam nor myself could see if the body was in the road of not.  Now, the placement of the body was right in front of a train overpass and given that fact we assumed one of two things to have taken place.  One, the guy had jumped off the bridge and performed a lazy hari kari or two, it was someone trying to get a car to stop for a carjacking.  Cam and I had the opportunity to discuss these possibilities once shock subsided somewhat and we could speak English again.  When you drive over a person, you can mostly only babble and curse.  But I digress, we got to Cam's car and got his ball bat and returned to the overpass to look for the body, but there was no body to be found.  Was he hooked under the car?  We didn't know for sure until we rounded the corner and saw the guy walking alongside the road.  Imagine our surprise.  Cam wanted to stop the car and beat the guy, but me being the ever-level headed fellow that I am pointed out that while I've won my fair share of fights, this guy had just been run over by a vehicle and was now strolling down the road.  He gets a free pass in my opinion.  So we called 911 and reported what happened.  Our friend (who was a police officer) followed up on it the next day and the cop on the scene said that there wasn't a single scratch on the guy's body but even if I had nailed him he wouldn't have felt it because he was so high on crack and that the officer wishes I had hit him.  He would've paid for the carwash just to avoid paperwork.  Moral of the story, see a person in the road and you should hit them for a free carwash from a friendly public servant.    You know what I hate?  I hate that friend (we all have one) that says he/she will be somewhere or call at a certain time and then never does.  Next time you see said friend, there is no apology given, they just pretend it didn't happen.  I mean sure, we can all be absent minded but some people are just habitual. It's rude and stupid and these people must die!     Back to Josh's Comic Corner.  Let's talk about Miracleman.  Written by Alan Moore in the mid-80's, Miracleman was a totally new type of comic book.  A renaisance for a character from the 50's that was basically a rip-off of Shazam, Miracleman was reshaped into something original under the masterful guidance of Mr. Moore and a rotating roster of artist.  It was really the first "mature" comic book.  When I say "mature" I don't just mean that people have sex.  Sure, it's alluded to in some books, but for me "mature" comics means that the book is dealing with concepts that are just over kids' heads or are just far too violent for younger readers.  All of these statements are true of Miracleman.  A man's discovery of his super-powers makes him distant to his wife, who can't handle what he has become.  An ex-sidekick goes insane and (graphically) kills an entire city's worth of people before Miracleman catches wind of what's happening and the first really graphic superhero brawl in comics takes place.  After the horrors that took place there, Miracleman creates a utopia.  Then legal matters in the real world put an end to my fanboy dream.  Such is life.  If you can find it and can afford it, you should pick it up.    Well, have a great weekend everyone.  Until next time....

      Hey kids, welcome to my blog.  This is really entirely self-indulgent, but that's ok.  I really don't know what I plan to do with this, I'm thinking it'll mostly be your typical "well today: blah blah blah" type of blog, but I'm planning to sprinkle stories of my life throughout and not to worry, I'm sure I'll go off on my patented Josh-rants as I go along.    You know who gets to be professional atheletes?  Yeah, the guys/girls that score alot of point, but I'm talking about the real stuff here, the stuff that legends are made of.  It's all in how you look when you are playing.  This occured to me as I played racquetball with my friend, Josh.  I am still pretty much a novice at racquetball, but I love the hell outta the game, and I was on a hot streak!  Dashing to and fro across the court I was punishing the ball like a busted frat kid in Singapore.  However, as I lunged for the ball and pulled off a sweet backhand, I could feel the contortions of my facial muscles.  It felt as though they were trying their damned-est to all occupy the same square inch of face at one time and I can only imagine the sheer sexiness exuded by said expression.  At this moment reality came crashing down.  I will never be a professional racquetball player because I make the faces of the Elephantman when I play.  Now keep in mind that I'm not even sure that there are professional racquetball players, but that's hardly the point now is it?  Let's just pretend that we're talking tennis.  When I play, do I have that intense Andre Aggasi look?  No.  Do I have that wicked angry McEnro look?  Huh uh.  It's all ElephantMan, baby and I've got a one way ticket to the amatuers because of it.    Okay, let's talk about yesterday.  I've lived in my house for 2 months and I was living a lie.  I told myself that I didn't need cable.  What the hell was wrong with me and why didn't anyone tell me that I was being a retard!?  Hell yes I need cable!  I turned on MTV and there was a music video playing.  When did this happen, there hasn't been a music video on MTV since 1994 with the advent of "The Real World" (and boy, reality TV is another rant for another day) and I go away for 2 lousy months and BA-BAM! the world's turned upside down.  Now granted, I'm always at the gym, reading, playing guitar or doing something, but there's always time for some mindless entertainment.  I also picked up the Chapelle's Show Season 1 DVD.  I missed this show when it originally aired, and I'm really kinda glad.  I notice that there's only about 17 minutes worth of show, which means that I would've sat through 13 minutes of commercials and that would just piss me right off.  Whoa, got off track.  The point was I am addicted to the Chapelle's Show.  "I'm rich, biatch!"    I think I just decided that I'll devote a little time to "Josh's Comic Corner" every day.  Mostly I'm going to pick a comic book to talk about, whether it be about the series as a whole or one particular issue.  But why not start off with something a little different?  Let's talk about the movie, Spider-Man 2.  It's freakin' fantastic!  I saw it three times in two days, I am the uber-geek!  Kneel before my geekitude.  I am going to say what all us geeks know, Spider-Man 2 is the best comic book movie to date.  Going into the theater for the first time, I already had high hopes for the flick.  I really enjoyed the first movie, and thought that the creators had really learned for their successes and mistakes the first time around.  I was so totally right.  The opening credits had paintings by the great Alex Ross giving a summary of the first movie, so if it's been a while since you saw the first movie, you're up and running with no problem.  The characters are very well rounded this time around, well, all except for Harry but obsession'll do that to a guy.  The comic book that was most closely alluded to in the movie was Amazing Spider-Man #50 titled "Spider-Man No More".  The shot of Peter Parker throwing away the Spidey costume was straight off of the cover of that issue.  Nice touch.  Now, I love Spidey.  I really do, but the antagonists in this flick are the real show stealers.  Doc Ock is just a sight to behold.  Climbing walls, throwing people, arms flailing about beating Spidey silly, it's just all eye candy.  J. Jonah Jameson absolutely fits the comic to a "t" (what is that supposed to mean anyway?).  I would watch a movie adaptation of "The Pulse" starring him the cast from the Dailey Bugle, no question.    Well, I think I've written way plenty for my first post.  Hope it's not been too boring.  See ya next time...
