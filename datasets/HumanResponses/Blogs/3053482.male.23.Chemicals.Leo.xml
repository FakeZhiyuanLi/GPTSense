      its 5 am and something woke me up. normally i would just go back to sleep but for some reason i decided to go burn a cd on my brother's computer. blink 182's take off your pants and jacket.  last night was rather uneventful, as usual. i took my dog for a walk with my brother john and parents. john and i were supposed to go to nashville to check out some coffee place in hopes to find a place to hang out that isn't a bar. my impression of life in tennessee so far is that unless you live right in nashville, life can get pretty boring out in the 'burbs of franklin. not once have i seen a famous country star, and supposedly they all live in franklin. maybe it's not so much that i'm bored, but that i just miss my old life. which old life, i'm not really sure, because back in buffalo i don't really recall doing much of anything. the "nothing" that we did do seemed fun though. i think i just need to make some friends. on monday i start my orientation for grad school, so i'm sure the friends will be pourin' in.

      Two nights ago I buzzed my chest hair with an electric clippers. All that remains on my chest now is stubble. The odd thing is to look at me while i'm naked. My chest is completely bald, but my arms, legs, and butt are as hairy as a gorilla.   On a totally unrelated topic, I noticed today a small black dot on the side of one of my molars.

      Fred wants me to post on this so I decided I would. Here's what's new in my life:  Going to see Dawn Oct. 18. Going to see Elvis Costello Oct. 30 There is still a black dot on my molar My chest hair grew back Grad school is like Undergrad school except undergrads think you know everything. I have to pick my research advisor soon. It's a weird process because all the grad students are fighting over a few certain people and some kids will do anything in their power to get in the group they want. Basically it's a research group @#%$ blocking festival.   now i must go proctor an exam.

      I am finding it virtually impossible to study for my last two final exams. My brain has been unable to concentrate. I cannot actually remember the proper studying techniques.  Anyway, yesterday, after taking my first final, I went Christmas shopping. I went all over town looking for the wildest and craziest women's boutiques, in hopes of finding something for dawn. i was not successful in my search. after a day of discouraging shopping, i decided it was time for a haircut. Recently, I have been extremely unhappy with how my hair looks. I really don't know where to go to get it cut, because I don't want to have just a short boring style. I decided that the Regis Salon in the mall was good enough. I also decided that no matter what, I would get my haircut there, and if it looked bad, it would be ok because it looks bad before the cut anyway.   Upon walking in, I saw my future stylist. Steven. Steven was a balding man with a weird looking moustache. At this point I almost left. I did not want to get cut up by some bald dude, after all, what does he know about hair. Then I decided that there was no turning back.  I sit down in the chair and he asks how I want it. I reply, "If you have something in mind, go for it. I have been getting a series of bad haircuts and I'm sick of it. I guess if I wanted to look like anyone, it would be the guy in this picture." I showed him the picture of the model in the Structure ad.   "Ok, well I guess I could cut it like that. But I had something else in mind. This is how I cut it for some of the musicians that come in here. It's the cut that the guy in the Goo Goo Dolls has." Steven says.  "The Goo Goo Dolls! No way, I don't want to look like that guy." I reply.  "No, maybe it's not the Goo Goo Dolls, anyway, I think it would look good."  Not really knowing what he has in mind, I tell him to go for it anyway. When he finishes, he has my hair all messed up, kinda like the uncombed comb look, but its still pretty long. I decide that I like how it looks. It is at this point that he remembers the band dude he was thinking of. "Oh, the Foo Fighters, thats the guy I was cutting it like!"  "DAVE GROHL?!?!?!" I proclaim. Steven says yes. So then I left with a Dave Grohl haircut. _____________________________________________ "Kelly's her mother's daughter, she likes guys in bands." --Jack Osbourne

      yesterday i went to a pentacostal church ceremony with my brother and mom. my brother has recently converted to pentacostalism due to the fact that his girlfriend is that denomination. the ceremony was quite different from what i am accustomed to, it consisted of repetitious use of the words Jesus, Amen, Alleleuiah, and Amen. The basic message was that "Jesus saves." This message took 2 hours to deliver, in the form of boisterous preaching, upbeat songs about how "He takes away our sins", and the grand finale of superscreaming of how jesus is so great and how he helps us. The singing portion was most entertaining. Each song was accompanied by the same fast drum beat, so each song sounded the same to me. They were kind of like if wesley willis made up songs about God. Now I am not busting on anyone's religion, but I found this particular practice of Christianity not for me. I don't feel the need to repeat amen over and over again in order to feel enlightened. I believe in god and the greatness of him and all that, but I prefer a ceremony in which the priesst/pastor deliver in a more philosophical teaching style lecture instead of a loud, repetitious, repetitious, delivery of amens and alleleuiah's. also, there was a woman there who had never cut her hair. EVER. and she was like 45ish. i think thats part of the religion, i'm not sure i understand that either. i also felt as though the attendees were just a little too happy, to see me. They tried to hug me and stuff. anyway, i dont think i'll be going back.  "People go out and look for false hope, amen. They go and waste their money on lottery tickets, amen. That's just stupid, amen. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, amen. Stupid is as stupid does."  --The pastor doing a really good Forrest Gump impression

      today is saturday but i had to go to school at 9 am to take a graduate profeciency exam. the exam was hard so i didn't hand it in. its ok though, because i have two years to accumate 5 B's. (They give the test every month). Then i took a 2.5 hour nap in a cubicle in the library, which i would say is very difficult, yet quite refreshing. i justify my sleeping in the library because i need to learn to sleep in uncomfortable spots for when i go to europe and have to sleep on trains. then i graded lots of papers and listened to music and got a call from ed trying to pretend he was from united airlines and his flight was cancelled. i listened to bikini kill and liz phair. i don't think girls like the girls in these bands actually exist. here are some lyrics from their songs: i'm not sure if there's a point to this posting.  Carnival, by Bikini Kill:  this is a song about the seedy underbelly of the carnival The part that only the kids know about this is a song about 16 year old girls giving head to carnies for free rides and hits of pot I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go to the carnival  _______________________________ Flower by Liz phair  Everytime I see your face I get all wet between my legs Everytime you pass me by, I heave a sigh of pain   (background lyrics sung throughout)   Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to @#%$ you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll @#%$ you and your minions, too Your face reminds me of a flower Kind of like you're underwater Hair's too long and in your eyes Your lips a perfect "suck me" size You act like you're fourteen years old Everything you say is so obnoxious, funny, true and mean I want to be your blowjob queen You're probably shy and introspective That's not part of my objective I just want your fresh, young jimmy Jamming, slamming, ramming in me Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to @#%$ you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll @#%$ you till your dick is blue  Everytime ________________________________________

      This is an email I just wrote to Fred. Although I directed it at Fred, I think it displays that my brain is having difficulties functioning lately. I have any sort of mental edge that I once had and all I can do is watch tv and stare at the wall. I would also like to add that my new background really kicks ASS!  ________________________________________ dear fred,  due to the fact that i have lost the ability to formulate my own opinions, I am writing you this email to ask you a question. Are you familiar with the band Local H? They are probably best known for their song "Bound For The Floor", but you probably would know the song better if I refered to it as the one that goes, "And you just don't get it, and you keep it copasetic, and you learn to accept it...blah blah blah blah". Anyway, they are a "grunge" band whom came out it about 96 who kinda tried to catch the wave of grunge a little too late. its only a guy with a guitar and a drummer, and the reason why i mention it is because they just came to nashville and this kid was raving about how awesome they are so he had me listen to one of their CD's. although the music is decent, i find it unoriginal, and almost exactly like nirvana. what constitutes a good band, and what is a rip off? tell me! cuz i don't know. i have decided that i don't dislike this band Local H, but I don't like them either. I also have decided that I lost my ability to be creative and a free thinker and so i want you to advise me from now on concerning all musical matters.  Which leads me to my next question: What version of Proud Mary should I like better, Ike and Tina's, or CCR's?  I am going to copy this entire email into my blog.  joe

      Dear Fred,  Can you change my background to something else?  _______________________________ i will be traveling to europe in 23 days. that is really cool.  the only reason i post on this blog is an attempt to catalyze some sort of creative spurt. i have to intentions of keeping a log of my life like frederick does, although i would like to do that if i could be as disciplined as him. at this point i would like to ponder the question, if you had a choice between winnie cooper or topanga, who would you choose? I would choose topanga, she's got more meat on her and she isn't so quiet. but i think fred is the better savage. i also think fred is the better schrock. but if i had a choice between tim schrock and ben savage, i would definitely choose hannah.

      I just came home from New York City, but nevermind that.  There are these two kids in my class whom are both from Great Britain. They have really strong accents. By really strong, I mean they are type of Brits that use the word "wanker" quite often. When they talk to each other I feel like I am listening to Liam Gallagher talk to Noel. In other words, I could really use some subtitles. Here is a sample conversation they had today:  UK1: I borked some krumpets and marmalade from bork. UK2: No @#%$? bork bork bork bork wanker UK1: bork bork bork bork bork the queen bork bork bork UK2: bork manchester united bork bork bork bork UK1: bork bork bork chunnel bork bork bork UK2: bork bork we drive on the wrong side of the road bork bork bork bork UK1: bork bork bork stonehenge bork bork bork  UK2: BORK BORK BORK BORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  In conclusion, my trip to Europe has made me less tolerant of other cultures and languages and even more American-centric than I ever was.

      Today is my brother Steve's 17th birthday. Happy Birthday, Steve!  For an interesting discussion on my trip to Europe, go here: pub72.ezboard.com/fpubliusfrm2 or go here: pub72.ezboard.com/fpubliusfrm3  Well, anyway, I am now a student at the State University of New York at Buffalo or SUNY at Buffalo for short, or UB for shorter. Due to the fact that I did not meet the GPA requirements of Vanderbilt, I am gone and in a swift turn of events, now at UB. It's a very big school, and so far it seems ok. I have encountered the following Canisius alums: Jon Bona, Kristen Ondesko, and Tom Zabawa (Chem major '01)  Things I have quickly been reminded about Buffalo: 1) It's as cold as balls 2) People speak in a sometimes annoying, sometimes comforting, always nasally, Western New York accent. 3) UB is a really big school. 4) Everything you need is a short drive away.  So anyway, thats good enough for now.

      December 26: The flight from DC to Dusseldorf was about 7 hours. Fred sat next to me. He played his new gameboy advanced the whole time. The meal was subpar but the snacks were ok.   December 27: We have arrived at the Dusseldorf airport. Ed is there waiting for us. So far the trip is going without any hitches. Then we took a shuttle to the train station to get Ed's family. They are waiting at the train station, equipped with 90,000 pounds of luggage. Then we go and try to use the ATM. I successfully withdraw 200 Euros, but surprisingly, Fred's Bank of Akron ATM card won't work in Germany. So, with nothing but US dollars on him, we all take a train to Bielefeld, the town Ed is living in. On the train, a German girl gets on and sits next to us. She is listening to Avril Lavigne's Sk8ter Boi. This is the first time we hear this song, but definitely not the last. My assessment of the German train system is that they are very nice trains, and they are quite efficient.   In Bielefeld, it seems like everybody wants to be an American. They all wear New York Yankees hats, the teenage kids wear FUBU and Sean Jean and Wu wear, and they all listen to our music. Bielefeld has an interesting little shopping area with all these Christmas shopping things. So after spending the day in Bielefeld we take a train to Berlin. Meanwhile, Fred has exchanged his American money, so he's got some Euros. The hotel in Berlin, an ETAP, has a really weird toilet. It's got no seat. This theme is resounded throughout the trip, toilets with no seats.  December 28: Our hotel is in East Berlin, so we get the see the remains of the Communist state. East Berlin was a cold looking town, with nothing but really ugly buildings. Germany in general doesn't ever seem to have any sunny days, so that doesn't really help the mood of East Berlin. Anyway, the train system is still really awesome. So we saw a bunch of famous sites in Berlin: The Brandenburg gate, the famous TV tower, the former site of the Berlin Wall, some church that was bombed during WWII, the Reichstag(the government building), the Russian embassy (which took up a whole block). We also went to the Checkpoint Charlie museum, which was an interesting museum about the Berlin wall. Also, we went into the Ka De Ve, which is the second largest department store in the world. Scott Snyder bought a German DVD of Fred Savage's famous movie, The Wizard. In Germany, it's titled "Joy Stick Heros".   December 29: We are enroute to Amsterdam. But before we get there, we have an interesting run in with a disgruntled East German on the subway. he heard us speaking english and starting yelling at us, telling us that when in germany we should speak german. then he said he hated all foreigners  because they take his job. ed was the only one talking to him since we don't speak german but we could all tell he was really mad...he was punching the seat really hard and even crying. then ed told him we weren't foreigners and we  were all from bielefeld. he asked scott, "are you from bielefeld?" scott said in really bad german, "kein deutch" then he got really really really really mad. but he got even madder when ed's dad told him "sprechinzie english"'  thankfully, the man calmed down and got off, calling us all idiots. we didnt learn what he was saying until ed told us when he got off, but i think if we would have known we all would have peed our pants. So after that we all sighed a sigh of relief and started on our way to Amsterdam.   Amsterdam is pretty neat. It is below sea level so there are all these dykes and dams keeping the water out. The city is made of an intricate system of canals, so there are lots of houses and stuff on each canal. The Anne Frank house is on one of these canals. The infamous Red Light District is also along one of these canals. So, the most interesting part of Amsterdam is the fact that prostitution and marijuana are both legal. This is immediately obvious when you walk down the red light district. Prostitutes (mostly fat ugly ones), dressed in skimpy lingerie display themselves in their windows and try to entice a would be customer. It was weird because I saw men going in, I saw men coming out, and I saw men negotiating. There are also many places in the red light district where you can pay to watch live sex, and pay to watch women stick various objects in their orafaces. Then there are the Coffee shops, where people go to smoke weed. These are placed strategically in between the prostitutes, so it makes for one big road of hedonism. This place called Cannibas College was cool, because this guy had a mini greenhouse in his basement where he was growing lots of marijuana.  December 30: This was our second day in Amsterdam. We saw the Anne Frank house, we went to some modern art museum. We also saw a secret catholic church that was hidden in an attic. Back some time ago, practicing catholicism in public was forbidden in Amsterdam, so people had to practice in their houses. We did not see, however, the Van Gogh museum. We just walked around a lot, and we didn't really know what we were looking for. It was fun anyway.  December 31: In the morning we took a train to Paris. We got there at about 2 pm. Waiting for us at our hotel were a bunch of Ed's friends. One American, one English kid, and three Germans. So from the hotel, we took the subway, we get out, and BAM, there's the Eiffel Tower. That was pretty cool to just see it so abruptly. Then we walked to the Louvre to meet some more friends. Fred and I wanted to go inside the Louvre, but unfortunately it was closed for the holiday. So we waited and waited for the friends. Then when they all came we did some walking down the Champs Elyses, where all the expensive shops in Paris are. This led to the Arch of Triumph. Anyway, I am starting to get sick of writing so I will get to the interesting part, the New Year's Eve celebration.  no, nevermind, I will continue this later.

      There is this kid in one of my classes who really really really really smells awful. It's a Tuesday and Thursday class. Since the class started about two months ago, I have not seen him wear a different outfit than the one he wears everyday. I sit approximately 5 to 8 feet away from him, but I can still smell him. I know it's him because when he walks by I really get a whiff of it. I seriously think he never showers. I think he probably just licks himself clean like a cat. His hair is so greasy that I think he could deep fry chicken wings on his head if he had a high fever.   This makes me wonder, does he know he smells? If so, does it bother him? Does he realize that by smelling so bad he is jeopardizing all his potential friendships. I don't want to be his friend because I wouldn't be able to stand the smell when I am next to him.

      I went to see Wesley Willis tonight. He started the show with strong political statement, "Osama bin Laden can suck my dick. So can Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein can suck my dick." Then he rocked out with a new (I think) TEchnics keyboard. He played some new stuff but also a lot of classics (I whupped Batman's ass, Rock and Roll McDonalds, Cut the mullet). The show was originally supposed to be played at the mohawk place, but hte fire marshalls closed it down because it was too small so the show was moved to the continental. He also played a great song called "Michael Jackson.  "You should be ashamed of yourself. You used to be a pop star. Now you are a pediphile. Stop molesting boys you freak!!"  --Wesley Willis ________________________________________  In other news, we have begun the war against Iraq. I personally am sick of waiting. They cover it too much on TV, it gets kind of monotonous. I just want this thing to get on with itself already. Too much foreplay.

      This is an email that I sent to some friends about going to bars. We were debating stuff.  ______________________________________________ I would have to disagree with the fact that bar scene gets old after 45 minutes. I have been to bars while drinking, and while not drinking, and I think that it all depends on the people that you are with. If you are stimulating yourself in other ways, like going from bar to bar, walking around to see other people, etc, then it doesn't get boring. Maybe if you go to one bar and you just sit there and drink then I would agree that is boring too. And I don't like to pay covers to places, so I usually avoid those places. Going to IHOP is fine, but sometimes the late night crowd at IHOP is just a boring atmosphere. That is why bars are fun to go to because there are a lot of people our age and I find it amusing to watch people when they are drunk.   The problem that I had with Fred the other night was the fact that I got the feeling that he would rather stay at home and do nothing than do something. I understand that it's a long drive for him and he wants to make sure we've got something really awesome planned, but for me I don't really care what we do just as long as I am not staying in the house and watching TV. Since leaving the college life I have found that I have suffered from a certain social withdrawal that was otherwise satisfied by living on campus with a lot of people my age, so I didn't have that feeling of urgency to "go out" on the weekend. Now, however I live with my grandma and I don't really socialize with anyone all week, so when the weekend comes, I want to go somewhere. It doesn't really matter where, I just want to hang with my friends and get out of the house. This is why I wrote the original email to Fred in the first place. I know that he has no other friends, and he knows that I have no other friends, so we both know that on friday night one of us is going to call the other to do something. I don't understand why he needs to make these formal plans. So basically, just being with you guys makes me happy. I love you all. Let's never fight again.  On a side note, Dave called me last night wanting to do something. I had to tell him that I was in Nashville. It was kind of funny.  --Joe    Quoting TomServo0@aol.com:  > I think we have two distinct schools of thought on the issue: >  > Drinking >  > Joe > Jeff >  > Non Drinking >  > Fred > Ed >  >  > Dave has not stated his position, though it looks he will swing to > the  > Joe/Jeff camp.

      I recently purchased several beauty products from drugstore.com. I bought Nivea After Shave Balm, Nivea face wash for men, Pantene Pro-V 2 in 1 conditioner, Nivea Moisturizing shower gel. I also bought a new stereo for $200. It has Dolby Digital capabilities so I can get surround sound for my DVDs that I play on my computer. Now all I have to do is get someone to watch them with me. I also recently began actually buying CDs instead of pirating them.   My new CDs  The Donnas "Spend the Night" Weezer "Maladroit" Frank Sinatra "The Reprise Years" Red Hot Chili Peppers "By the Way"  Also, I auditioned for the show blind date. Hopefully I will get called back so Roger Lodge can make a fool of me.  Also, Fred stole one of his blog posts from Catherine's weblog. Also, Fred is gay.   later.

      I recently saw one concert featuring the following bands:  One World Tribe (a Reggae band from Buffalo (I think) Andrew WK The Used The Roots  My assessment of this show. One world tribe put on a good reggae show, I have seen them once before and they were good then too. Andrew WK was awesome. His music is straight up metal and his lyrics are very simple and usually deal with partying and having fun. You can't even understand what he says but it doesn't matter because he is such an awesome on stage presence. He stands about 6'4". He is white. He has stubble and long brown hair. He wears a dirty white t-shirt and dirty white jeans. It's clear that he hasn't showered in a few days. During the show, he encourages fans to climb up on stage. While on stage, he gives them the mic and lets them sing, and sometimes he even puts them on his shoulders. When he's not partying with the fans, he swings his arms all over the place, does a lot of cheerleader kicks and spins. He even did a song called, "I love Buffalo", which I think he wrote that day. The final song he allowed about 20 people on stage. It wasn't violent or anything, just a lot of energetic jumping around. The fans were just really excited to participate in the show.   Then the used came on. The suck my ass so bad. Your typical "suck ass alt-nu-rock-emo-bullshit I am gay music" that is being played on modern rock radio stations these day. Each song was sandwiched between a stupid little phrase about what this song means to him. For instance, "This is a song about being lonely, I know everyone in here has been lonely at least once." Plus the lead singer dated kelly osbourne which makes him even more annoying because he thinks he's extra special.  Anyway, then came the headliner, the roots. Whoever was running the soundboard was doing a terrible job. The appeal of the roots is that they are a hip hop group that has a real live backing band, with guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, and turntables. No drum machines or anything. So I was expecting a really smooth, jazzy, hip hop feel. For some reason, however, the vocals were cranked up really really loud and you couldn't hear any of the instruments playing. All you could hear was the percussiveness of the lyrics. It was like listening to the radio on a crappy boombox thats turned up way too loud. We left after about 4 songs, because the sound was that bad. I am going to see the roots again in the summer at field day fest, so maybe they'll put on a better show then.  Then the next night I went to akron, ny to fred's house. His parents were out of town so his sister threw a party. At this party, I met some of the weirdest people, EVER. This party had everything: it had a guy on the couch that slept the whole time, a guy that used "@#%$" in every sentence, a guy named, a guy that laughed at everything, and a guy that explained to us the fastest way to get out of being in the navy without saying you're gay. I don't think I'm really doing this party justice, because my primitive writing skills can't describe it. I will just say that I am convinced that Fred Schrock is the smartest man in Akron, New York...EVER.  PS Shout out to scotty. let's go to fuji grill.

      Last night I enjoyed the rock and roll stylings of Queens of the Stone Age and Zwan. QSA are the kings of stoner rock, whatever the hell that means. Highlights of the show were when the lead singer looked like Craig Kilbourne, when the lead singer said he wished he was drunk, and when the lead singer was no longer the lead singer because a new lead singer came out and Craig Kilbourne was reduced to just the guitarist.  Then Zwan came. Billy Corgan was bald. As bald as usual. And the band did a cover of the Beatles classic "Don't let me down". and they did an Alice Cooper cover. The show was good, but it wasn't like getting your ass rocked off by Wesley Willis.  In conclusion, my two friends from college are gay all of a sudden. It's like in Big Daddy when Adam Sandler's too friends are gay after college.

      So yesterday I was driving, and I realized from the noise that my muffler fell off. I decided that maybe I could go find it, if I just retraced my route from home to school. After retracing my steps and not finding it, I gave up. Then a series of antics ensued, which are summed up best by Frederick Schrock Fred's Blog  But anyway, today I was driving to school, and in the middle of the road was my muffler! It fell from the heavens. I nearly ran into it. Unfortunately, it was pretty mangled already, so it wasn't salvagable. New mufflers on '92 Buick Centuries cost about $86 for parts and labor.  Rock over London Rock on Buffalo, New York Meineke, it's the muffler store   Edited by: JoeFerguson at: 4/2/03 10:19:27 am

      Last night I saw the Foo Fighters in Cleveland. It was a rocking show. I attended the show with my brother John and my friends Fred and Dave. The first opening band was some ball buster crappy one that I care not to find out the name of. The second band was a band called Chevelle. They were a heavier band, but the dudes in it looked like a bunch of Abercrombie kids. They began each song with a stupid phrase like "This is about being true to yourself." Then they would bust out some heavy riffs and incoherent lyrics. I wasn't too impressed. During Chevelle's set, John left to go farther away from the stage. When I asked him why he did this, he said, "I don't want to stand here like the rest of these @#%$ drones listening to a bunch of guys that have IQ's lower than Shadow (our dog)." I told him that he wouldn't be able to get up this close once he leaves, but that didn't bother him.  Anyway, the foo fighters kicked ass. Dave Grohl told us that he was born in Warren, OH. That was something I did not know. So Ohio was him home state. Yeah and he had a lot of funny interludes in between each song. Before playing, "For all the Cows" he did a long little speech about how a lot of his family was here and Uncle Jesse requested this song or something like that. But what was funnier was when he pulled his guitar tech out on stage and had everyone sing happy birthday to him. And then he said that they got him a male stripper who was a cop and was "packing heat, if you know what I mean" When I got home and checked foofighters.com there actually was a picture of the guitar tech with a male stripper in a thong on top of him. Kinda funny. Ok, back to the show. So Dave Grohl is funny to see live because he screams at the top of his lung almost all the verses and all the songs. Or he will say something like, "ok, here we go!!!!!!" before the verse. Taylor Hawkins was pretty impressive on drums, I always held it against him for being Alanis MOrissette's drummer, but he played well. the other two guys in the band (Nate MEndell, bass) and Chris Shifflet (guitar, i don't know if i spelled it right) were just there. They weren't really as charasmatic as dave grohl and taylor.  Then we drove home from cleveland. we tried to find a place to eat off the 90, but at each exit everything was closed. we ended up stopping at this crappy gas station and I bought $10 worth of beef jerky. Then like an hour later we found a sweet gas station with an all night Subway shop, but it was too late because I already ate the beef jerky. Fred and Dave managed to find room for subs. We didn't get home until 4 am but it was worth it.

      This is actually being posted on May 30, but it describes the events that occurred on the evening of May 25. ________________________________________ My brother John is in town so we decided to go to the new Casino in Niagara Falls. It is run by Native Americans. Anyway, John came to Buffalo with all but $40. This money was given to him by our mom since he has no job. Nevertheless, he decided to see if he could have any luck at the blackjack tables. He sits down, and hands the dealer $30 (minimum bet $15). I don't want him to look like a small timer, so I throw in $40 more. The dealer hands John $70 in chips and then John puts down $15 to gamble. He is a dealt a Queen. Then a 6. So he has $16. I expect him to hold, but John orders, "Hit me." The dealer tells him he has to use hand signals to get a hit, so John taps his hand on the table. He is dealt a 2. So he has 18. The dealer then busts. John wins $15. Then he says, "Cash me out, I'm done." The dealer looks a bit confused, considering he just gave John $70 in chips 45 seconds ago. Then we contemplate whether or not to let the $15 ride or just pack it in. I blow $5 on the slot machines and then we go home. I should have learned a lesson from John.

      My recent purchases:   Guitar Slide 2003 Honda Civic EX (Black)  Yes. That is correct. Since we last spoke, I have become a man and bought a brand new car. So yeah so I priced insurance companies and I found GEICO to be the cheapest. So when you buy a car at a car dealer, they actually say phrases like "What do I need to do to get you to sign something tonight?" and "I want you to write a number down and I'll go talk to my manager to see if we can get your payments that low." I think the whole process of purchasing a car is outdated. I almost bought a used car, but then realized that I could get a new one for a really low interest rate because the economy sucks. Plus, car dealers can't jack up the price of a new car, they have to charge what it's worth. And what's great, is that you can look up the invoice price (What the car dealer pays before mark-up) on the internet. So I started my negotiating right at the invoice price. It cut the BS out of the process. Anyway, I still think the the purpose of a car salesman is obsolete. My grandpa sold cars all his life, and my grandma's brother also sells cars. But I still think that there shouldn't be the ridiculous negotiation process. Dealers should just charge one price, that includes their profit, and never change it...EVER. Cars will sell themselves, salesmen aren't needed. People need cars, they don't need to talk to dealers. That's why I like GEICO. You save money because you don't deal with insurance agents. You deal directly with the company. I am my own agent. Anyway....  So when I picked up the car tonight, my uncle Larry came with. This was quite fortunate, because he noticed a small scratch on the car that I never would have seen. They are going to fix this scratch free of charge. I have a feeling that they knew it was there and they were just going to pull the wool over my eyes. Oh well, they're not going to charge me to fix it.  So I'm sick of typing. Goodnight..

      I saw Pearl Jam May 2, 2003 at the HSBC arena in buffalo, NY. It was one of the best concerts I have ever seen. I think it was the best ever actually. It was so totally awesome. They played for like 3 hours. And Eddie Vedder was doing his Pete Townshend windmills and once he even did a Roger Daltry microphone spin. They did a cover of CCR's "Fortunate Son" and of course the Who's "Baba O'Riley" and The Police's "Driven to Tears". They dedicated a song to Buffalo's own Vincent Gallo (of Buffalo '66) and they played one song to a mask of Bill Gates. For the third and final encore, the lights were on, which I thought was an even more interesting touch. The band really seemed as though they were enjoying themselves, which inturn rubbed off on the crowd. Anyway, my friend Rob got really, really drunk and fell asleep in his chair during the concert. Before the first encore, he woke up, puked on the floor, and then left for the bathroom. It was still dark, so as people walked by, the kept stepping in the large pile of vomit that they didn't know was there. It was quite funny. By the third encore, Rob had returned. When the show ended, he proclaimed, "It was a good concert, but I've been to better. Billy Joel and Elton John were a better concert, so was the Tom Petty show." Rob, if you're reading this, you were sleeping! You were completey drunk during the whole show. I do not think you have a right to give a review. Also, in a related note, Billy Joel??!?!??!?! Elton John??!!?!?!?! I mean I think they're fine musicians, but better than Pearl Jam? Their music isn't really comparable, but Eddie Vedder is just so much cooler than Billy Joel and Elton John combined. I don't care if Billy Joel was married to Christie Brinkley, and I definitely don't give a rats ass how many pairs of glasses Elton John owns.   I also saw X-men 2 this weekend. It was excellent, better than the first movie. It was also better than Spider Man. Now, all I want to do is get an adamantium skeleton and learn to play guitar like Stone Gossard.

      Tonight I was really bored. I had nothing to do. All my friends were either working or too far away to hang out. I was feeling like I couldn't sit still. I was so bored, that I actually went to school and filtered a product of a reaction I did yesterday. This was at 10. I stayed at school till 11. Then I drove downtown. I went into the Spot and got a Cocoamocha for free (I had a certificate for a free one). Then I went outside on the deck to read Nine Stories by J.D. Salinger. Within about 10 minutes of my sitting, this black man in a wheelchair wheeled up next to me and said, "My man, put your head up, I know you saw me." So I did.   wheels: "Could you spare a dollar for me?" Me: What do you need a dollar for? W: to buy a beer Me: A beer? What do you need a beer for? W: it helps me sleep.  Now, this was the first time that a beggar was honest about what he was going to spend his money on...Booze. I found that admirable, but I continued to question him. The man was missing two front teeth and unshaven. Despite his physical appearance, he was quite articulate. We continued to talk, and he told me how he wound up in the wheel chair. He claimed he had osteodystrophy. At first I didn't believe him. Then he explained what it was. Then he lifted up his shirt and showed me his belly with a huge vertical scar that started at the bottom of his ribcage and went down a few inches below his navel. His stomach looked like it was trying to bust out his gut. At some point during the beginning of the conversation, I pulled out the copy of the Bible I had in my backpack, just to let him know that I meant business. He saw it and began explaining how it was a miracle that he was alive, because he had been shot in the aorta and was in a coma for two months. I didn't quite believe him, but then he showed me the bullet holes that were still oozing with pus. Some stranger walked by and gave the man a half opened bottle of Budweiser. He took it and drank as we talked. I told him he wouldn't need my money now, because now he had his beer. We continued to talk, for about 30 minutes. His name was Kevin. He told me a lot of things, some of them perhaps lies, but it was an interesting conversation. He told me of his crackhead girlfriend who he was unable to have sex with since his accident. He told me that he went to Buff state for two years and studied management. He told me he was thinking about going back to school. He told me that he wasn't sure if he had his pancreas or not (he couldn't understand his doctor's Indian accent). The only thing that I really am sure of about this guy is that he had been shot, because the wounds were definitely real. So was the brace he had around his stomach, holding his guts in place (His abdomen was a giant hernia from the surgery). He said he was a religious man. It was one of the most interesting conversations I ever had, whether or not it was completely true or what. He actually was the one who got sick of me, saying he had to go. He said, "Ok man, I gotta get going. You're not going to give me my dollar are you?" I gave him two, because I told him he had earned it. Then HE told me to never do drugs. I told him the same, and I made him swear on the Bible that he never would. "I swear on the Bible that I will try my best to make the best out of my life from now on and not do drugs." Usually I never talk to beggars, I just tell them no, but tonight I am glad that I talked to this dude, because he made my night. I think I am going to carry the Bible with me where ever I go. I think it keeps the beggars honest.

      Tonight I went for sushi with my friend Scott at Kuni's on Elmwood. I really like sushi, and Scott really likes sushi, so we have become sushi buddies. At times its kind of strange, because we meet specifically for this one reason, and that is to get sushi. Tonight we even went so far as to share a dessert. It seems the only people I hang out with lately are guys. Oh well, I'm sure our sushi affair will continue.  Also, I have recently discovered the Friendster.com service. It works on a six degree of separation basis. I sign up and then I have a friend list and I am "Connected" to my friends' friends, and so on. So right now I am connected to 152,000 people. It's really cool, but it's also quite addicting. Anyway, I have to go now. If you are so inclined as to sign up, use josephsferguson@yahoo.com as a reference.

      on june 10 i attended a "town meeting" on the future of buffalo at the canisius college koessler athletic center.   in attendence: mayor anthony masiello, erie county executive joel giambra, and a bunch of other politians. this event was televised live and open to the public. basically they discussed how they were going to turn buffalo around. then it turned into a free for all. this idiot with a green hard hat on who was representing the green party starting telling everyone why we should join the green party. there was also a moron with a red flag who just kept waving it around. later in the evening we saw this moron at panos.   i asked him why he had the red flag. He said, "don't you know history?" I said, "So you're a communist?" he said, "No, socialist." Then he proceeded to tell me the wonders of socialism, blah blah blah blah blah. how he has to work 55 hours a week and still have time for college and he doesn't have health care blah blah blah blah blah. Then I asked him if he knew that the old DDR train cars have two different classes and if he thought that was kind of ironic since it was supposed to be a classless society. he said it wasn't a classless society, blah blah blah blah blah. Basically, this guy was telling me in more words than he needed that it was somehow my fault that he didn't have health care and that he had to work 55 hours a week. I wish I hadn't spoke to him because he was really annoying. he reminded me of the east german that we came across in berlin who was also down on his luck. i think if lucian or micah were there they would have had a more fruitful debate. i just wanted to eat my chicken souvlaki.

      On June 7 I attended the field day fest at giants stadium in new jersey. Bands I saw: Liz Phair, Beth Orton, Spiritualized, Underworld, Blur, Beastie Boys, Radiohead. I attended this show with my friends Fred and Dawn.  First of all, this was supposed to be a two day thing in long island, but they cancelled that and turned it in to a one day thing at a stadium. It rained all day. Literally. We sat in the rain all day. My quick review of each performance:  Liz Phair: She only did about 8 songs and it was a set featuring her on electric guitar, a dude on an acoustic, and a bassist. No drummer. So she didn't really rock. She just played quietly. I was kind of dissapointed, but I am glad I got to see her live. She did some old songs like @#%$ and Run and Supernova and she did some new songs from her upcoming album.   Beth Orton: Some british chick with an acoustic guitar. She has a really cool voice, but being that it was really starting to rain, all I wanted to do was rock. then she told some joke about farting. This lady reminded me of a chemistry professor I had at canisius.  Spiritualized: 5 british dudes playing loudly. Their songs were very simple. I read somewhere that there music is "progressive blues". Well sort of. Either way it was very repeptitive. I guess like the other two performers, I didn't hate their performances I just wasn't blown away.  Underworld: Two techno guys. It was raining. we had to pee and eat so we went into the tunnels of the stadium. Didn't really catch much of his set but I heard the one song he has from the trainspotting soundtrack. Apparently he put on a good set but I couldn't tell. It felt like it was one big rave at this point.  Blur: Blur put on a very good show. they played boys and girls, and song 2 and a bunch of stuff from the new album and they also played tender. Damon Albarn threw ponchos in the crowd and said he was used to the rain being from england. and he ran around and got wet himself so it was fun. Dawn and fred made fun of me for not knowing the words to song 2.  Beck: oh wait, beck didn't perform. While waiting for beck to come on, this guy came out and said, "Ladies and gentleman, beck took a spill and was rushed to the hospital. He won't be performing this evening. The good news is, the Beastie Boys are up next." We were all kind of confused, but I already had seen beck live so I wasn't that dissapointed. I guess he got hit in the ribs and had to go for x-rays.  Beastie Boys: It stoped raining at this point. Ok so this was probably the band that I wanted to see the most. I had never seen them before and was really looking to get blown away by an unbelievable performance. What they gave me was a disorganized, unrehearsed set in which they had to stop about 5 songs because they couldn't remember their next verse. I think they got thrown off with Mix Master mike's remixes of the songs, but then they said they didn't even have a set list so i guess MMM was just surprising them. It was still fun to see one of my favorite bands perform live, but it was dissapointing.  Radiohead: This was the second time I saw them and they definitely did not dissapoint me at all. I think the best live performers I have ever seen are Danko Jones, Pearl Jam, and Radiohead. They are 5 really ugly english guys but for some reason all the girls in the audience want them. Each member plays with mixing machines in addition to their traditional instruments so it is really neat to watch because somebody is always tinkering with something. Very good show. __________________________________________ The next day we walked around manhattan. it was the puerto rican parade so that was interesting because we watched hundreds of large booty girls stuffed in jeans that were 900 times too small. We watched the puerto rican men gawk and stare at the women and some of them even brought their video cameras to tape the large backsides. then we saw pharrell williams and fabulous on a float. it was a cool weekend.

      For months I have been trying to cancel AOL. I signed up in January to get the free trial and just use it for checking email. Then when my free trial was up I tried to call and cancel. Instead, they gave me two more free months. Then I got sick of having a slow modem connection so I splurged for the cable modem. When I tried to cancel AOL again, I became very upset to learn that I had already been charged for the month I was trying to cancel for (I called a day late). Then I got very angry and told the woman that all I wanted to do was cancel. What ensued was 30 minute conversation that explained to me why I can cancel anytime, but that I should try AOL anyway some more to see what it's like. They gave me some more free months, but not the present month. So I was like, screw this, I don't want to pay for the month just because I called a day late. I called a few days later and another representative asked his boss to take the charge off the bill. So eventually they did. At this point, I was convinced that I would not be able to cancel AOL without having a 45 minute conversation with a representative. This of course was until tonight. I called, he asked my name, I told him. Then I said I wanted to cancel. He asked why. I said because I'm sick of it. He asked what I was sick of. I told him I was sick of having to explain myself everytime I want to cancel. He said "ok" and like that I was cancelled. Before I knew it he was telling me my confirmation number for my cancellation. I said, "Don't I have to give you my credit card info to verify that it is really me calling you?" He said no. I asked why not and he replied, "Because I am a different kind of person." That was the most awesomest dealing that I have ever had with a telemarketer. He was probably doing a bad job at his job, but he did me a great service. I think he said his name was Richard. Thanks Richard!  Also, the two day rock festival named field day fest has become a one day concert to take place at giants stadium instead of a huge woodstock like venue. Oh well, at least we'll get to see the beastie boys. And I better get all my money back from teh first one I paid for. If not there will be hell to pay.  later  joe

      A few weeks ago I ran into my wheel-chaired friend Kevin. He remembered me, despite the fact that he was drinking a 40 oz. beer. (I believe it was Old English)   Two nights ago, my band, Cucumber + Ginseng, filmed the performance footage for our first video. We did it for the song "Cucumber + Ginseng". The video, like the song, is essentially an introduction to our band's style, attitude, and image. I believe we will be shooting some other scenes for the video today or tomorrow, but it won't be completed until the director (John Ferguson) can edit all the footage and make a finished product. The only real problem that I see with the video is that the song is only one minute long, so the on-screen rocking has to be very concise.

      Right now I am going to speak of an ongoing problem that plagues our society. This probably is basically on the order of people being inconsiderate, but I will be discussing a very specific form of this inconsideration. I will be speaking of people's disgusting habit of leaving the toilet seat dirty after using it. Now, I go to a school where the enrollment is 25,000 people, but I consistently use the same public restrooms since I am always in the same building. Most men have come to accept the fact that urine will always be on the toilet seat of a public toilet. Women don't understand why men cannot simply lift up the seat before they urinate, or why they can't clean the seat off with some toilet paper if they do happen to sprinkle some on the seat. This aggrevates me so much, because I lived in a home where my own brothers did this. They would urinate on the seat and then leave it there. I couldn't understand why they would do this, especially since they will inevitably have to use this seat to sit on, and I am assuming will have to clean it. Unless of course they enjoy sitting in their own pee. Now, I would imagine any women would be amazed by this at this point, but it gets worse. In fact, I really can deal with pee on the seat at a public restroom, because it gets worse. On the end of the seat, I frequently find feces on it. Not a whole turd, but mushy pooh. Now, how the @#%$ does this happen? Pooh doesn't come out of the top of your crack, it comes out of your @#%$, @#%$! Why can't you keep the @#%$ pooh in the @#%$ toilet!?!??!!? And if by chance you do accidentally get some pooh on the seat, why the @#%$ don't you have the decency to clean it up for the next guy? Do you @#%$ in your own bed? You savage! I think anyone that leaves pooh and or pee on a toilet seat of a public restroom they should be shot. It is a matter of consideration. How would you like it if I left pooh on your desk. Or your shoe? Or your pants? I hate people like you. Why can't you just clean up after yourself?

      So today was the first day of classes at my school (The State University of New York @ Buffalo, aka SUNY @ Buffalo, aka UB). I only had one class and it was at 8 am so I got a good parking spot. I am looking out the window now and it's an extreme gridlock to get a spot. I want to go to the bank to cash a check, but I don't want to lose my parking spot. I'll probably just wait. Anyway, today is day one of Scott and Joe's Semester of Sushi extravaganza. Starting today, we will be getting sushi for lunch at least once a week, throughout the semester.  And Ed, thank you is 'shia shia', but the I still cannot pronounce it correctly. Have Richard teach you about the different tones for each word.

      I just sent this message to ticketmaster. I hate them more than I hate anything in this world. They have screwed me out of years of convenience fees and there is no way to stop them because they have a monopoly on the promotion business. Anyway, here's the message:  _______________________________________ I know that the August 1 White Stripes show in Pittsburgh is cancelled. I received an email stating that in order for me to get a refund I need to mail the tickets back to Ticketmaster. I believe this task is something I should not have to do, considering I already paid the $6.95 per ticket "convenience" fee. If this fee were truly keeping my convenience in mind, my refund would automatically be credited to my credit card immediately upon announcement of the show's cancellation. Please refund my money to my credit card.  _______________________________________________

      Here is an update on Dave's location after I left him in Canada last Friday night. The message is from the man himself. ______________________________________________  Hello,  I'm writing from the Wi-Fi station on the Dansberrys' farm in Moosepatch, Manitoba, Canada. After enjoying my favorite tipple at the Hard Rock Cafe over the weekend, I decided to whisk myself off to the great northern reaches of Canadian civilization and become a moose photographer. In fact, my first moose shoot is next Wednesday, you should come along. Her name is Bounce.  Anyway, what's up? what are you doing for halloween? maybe i could fly in for a few hours.  ~ Manitoba Dave

      One of my favo(u)rite bands, Danko Jones, just released a new CD in the U.S. called "Born a Lion". Unfortunately this CD is not new to me because it was released about a year ago in Canada, the band's home country. Since I live near the Canadian border we can just go and get the CD in Canada. My copy of "Born a Lion" was purchased in Toronto (I think) by my friend Ed/Fred (I can't remember which one) and I paid him back later. Danko Jones' real new CD, "We Sweat Blood" was released in Canada on October 21. In order to get it in the U.S. you have to special order it and pay like $24 for it because it's an import. To defeat this import price, I decided to take a quick trip to Fort Erie, Ontario to pick myself up a copy of it for a mere $15 Canadian (which is like $12 American).   Fort Erie is right across the border from Buffalo, so it's about a 20 minute drive from my house. Since I don't normally frequent Fort Erie, I brought my friend Dave with me since he is a Fort Erie regular (due to it's abundance of strip clubs and completely nude strippers). I figured it would be easy to find a place to buy CDs in this bustling border town. When we got there, my guide Dave was only able to direct me to the strip clubs. After about 30 minutes of searching, we found a super huge, brand new Wal-Mart Supercenter. We checked the CD department, but alas, no Danko Jones. The consolation was that we were able to purchase some Canadian Candy delights (Coffee Crisp and Aero bars). The female cashier at Wal-Mart (who was extremely attracted to our American accents and dress) told us there was a CD store right down the road called CD plus. "It's right next to the drive-in Tim Hortons and the Beer Store." Now if you know anything about Canada, you know that there exists a Tim Hortons donut shop for every 5th citizen in the country. That means there are approximately 22 Tim Hortons in a 1 mile radius. We drove down Fort Erie's "main drag", but were unable to find the CD plus. Disappointed, we stopped at a Wendy's and asked another female cashier (also turned on by our Americaness) where the hell the CD plus was. "Oh, that store went out of business." She told us the closest place to get CDs was at a mall in Niagara Falls, Ontario, which is about a 20 minute drive from Fort Erie. At this point it was 8:30 pm.   Knowing that we had little time, Dave and I leaped back into my super charged Honda Civic and hopped on the Queen Elizabeth Expressway. Speeding down the highway at 120 km/h, spitting in the face of the laws enforced by the OPP (Ontario Province Police), Dave and I knew we were destined to get this damn CD. We pulled into the parking at about 8:55, five minutes before closing. We ran into the mall, not knowing where the CD store was. Most of the smaller stores had already started to close their storefront gates. Still running, we approached a split in the mall. I went left, Dave went right. Fortunately, I went the right way. I ran into Sunrise Records, and while still out of breath, asked the clerk if they had the new Danko Jones release. Like the good record store clerk he was, he directed me to the CD and gave me one. I grabbed another and said, "I'm going to take two." (one for my good buddy Fred). The clerk asked, "Why not take three? Or Four?" I think he was a bit perplexed by me buying multiple copies of the same CD. As I was cashing out, Dave walked into the store and he looked concerned. I gave him the thumbs up to let him know that the mission was completed.  Dave then called his friend Tom, who had planned on meeting after our Canadian excursion. Dave found out that Tom was 10 minutes away from the Hard Rock Cafe in Niagara Falls (Canadian side). We arranged a meeting point, and I dropped Dave off right in front of the Hershey store. I didn't see his friend Tom anywhere, and I haven't talked to Dave since. I sure hope Tom made it to the Hard Rock and that Dave found a ride back to the USA.  I ended up going out with my friend Brad to some bars in Buffalo. We went to the Old Pink, and I saw my friendster Celeste again and I think she was wearing the same shirt that she had on the last time I saw her which is the same shirt that she has on in her friendster picture.  In related news, "We Sweat Blood" is a good CD. I like it better than "Born a Lion" but not better than Danko's earlier work found on the "My Love is Bold" EP. A few songs on "We Sweat Blood" even sound like songs by the Hives, probably due to the fact that Danko is on a Swedish record label.

      So I guess a lot of things have been going on, but this story I feel is the most "blog worthy". On Friday night I went out with some friends to some popular watering holes in Buffalo. After going to the most "popular" Chippewa entertainment district (where all the sluts hang out) we decided to hit The Old Pink. It is basically a dive bar in the Allentown neighborhood of Buffalo. The neighborhood is the closest thing Buffalo has to any cool hip beatnik Greenwich village type place. So to sum up, it is a place where all the wannabe artsy/musician types hang. They let you smoke eventhough there is a smoking ban in all the bars, the bathrooms have troughs instead of urinals, and the music they plays ranges from beat heavy techno to old school punk like the Clash. But the description of the bar has nothing to do with my story. So I was in there, and I saw this girl that I recognized. Looking more closely at her face, I realized that I knew her because she was one of my "friendsters". I had seen other friendsters in public before, but I never interacted with any of them, because that would make me a total loser. Well I guess now I am a total loser because I actually confronted this girl. The coversation went like this:  Joe: "Is your name Celeste?"  Celeste: {giving Joe the 'Please don't kill me you psycho' look} ".....Yes."  Joe: "You are one of my friendsters!"  Celeste: {laughs, her friend laughs too} "Oh yeah, ok. Which one are you?"  Joe: "I'm Joe. I'm the guy with the beard drinking the huge beer."  Celeste: "Oh yeah, I remember."  Joe: "Ok well, I didn't think I would ever actually meet one of my friendsters, because I thought it would be totally weird."  Celeste: "...yeah.."  Joe: "Yeah, ummmm, I have nothing else to say. See ya later."  After the conversation was over, I went back to my friends. They were like, "yo, who is that girl you were hitting on?" I shamefully had to admit that she was my friendster and I wasn't hitting on her. Anyway, the next day, I looked her up on friendster to refresh my memory. She had already written me a testimonial. Then I looked at the shirt she had on in her picture. It was the same shirt she was wearing at the bar! CRAZY!!! Ok. That's my story. Anything else that has occurred in my life has been inconsequential.

      Last night I ran in to my cousin. His name is Tom Angelo. I never knew how we were related, and I still am unclear on it. But he remembered me. And he remembered how we were related. I think running in to him is an omen. I got his phone number. Perhaps we can become best buds.

      Based on our blog backgrounds one would suspect that Ed is a beer guzzling German football (soccer) fan, Fred is an abstract artist and/or the Greek god of lightning, and I am a funky, African-American Outkast fan. The truth is, all three of us are just dorky middle class white twenty something white men whom spend far too much time on the internet writing musings that will only be read by the three of us. That being said, I have a few interesting stories.  The other day I caught my friend checking out a transvestite. We saw her(him) initially from behind, wearing a super tight tank top and sporting some extremely perky(fake) breasts. My friend began to drool and made a b line over to this woman (man) and tried to pretend he wasn't checking her out. When she(he) turned around, it became obvious that she was actually a he. This explained her(his) unusually large breasts and unusually tall height. I began laughing uncontrollably, but my friend, who I would speculate was quite aroused just prior to learning that the woman was a man, did not find it so funny. He immediately sported a half disgusted/half embarrassed look on his face and this just made me laugh harder. Anyway, the lesson is, never check anyone out until you see their genitals.

      To whom it may concern:   Specifically, the members of the band, Fred and Dave.  This is the mission statement of Cucumber + Ginseng. Perhaps it is my own personal vision of the band and not necessarily the views expressed by the band as a whole, but ultimately I hope we shall adopt this mission.   Cucumber + Ginseng is the artistic collaboration between David J. Hill, Frederick C. Schrock, and Joseph S. Ferguson. Specifically, but not limited to, Cucumber + Ginseng is the musical collaboration between these men. The entity of Cucumber + Ginseng was spawned from the inner creative souls of these three men, and it will exist forever as long as these three men associate with each other. When Dave writes a funny weekly update to his fellow members, that is in essence, the entity of Cucumber + Ginseng speaking on his behalf. When Fred writes an issue of Fredline News, once again, C + G has a voice. When Joe coins the term, "Schropper", C + G has a hand in it. Now, these specific creations were accomplished by the individuals, but they would not be entertaining without the approval of the two other members. Ultimately, my goal, is to harness this creativity into something more tangible than a mere catch phrase. Specifically, I would like this to be converted to music. Not the best music of all time, but music that the members can find entertaining. Rather than waste the creative energy of C + G on random musings, I would like to harness the energy into musical happiness. Every weekend C + G gets together to have fun, but time is usually spent wasting money on alcohol. Not that this isn't fun, but I personally would find it more fun to be playing music with my friends and maybe having the possibility of making something cool. We would accomplish something with our free time rather than wasting money on alcohol. This is why I have decided to buy a drum kit to be stored at my house for all subsequent C + G gatherings. The drum set will be there. The guitars will be there. It doesn't mean that we have to use them, but it would make it a lot easier to just start jamming. As long as you will be at my house, we might as well rock. And if C + G never becomes the band that I hope it can be, so be it. That is ok. I will have a drum set and a couple of guitars that I can give to my children and let them rock.   This, in essence, is my personal vision for Cucumber + Ginseng. Three friends, gathering at one house, and jamming at their leisure. If they produce hit records, great. If they don't produce hit records, that's great too. I think it will be more fun than wasting money on bottles of Coors Light and crappy food at Tom's.  Sincerely,  Joseph S. Ferguson Cucumber + Ginseng   Edited by: JoeFerguson at: 3/31/04 11:28 pm

      I went to New York city this weekend. I forgot deodorant. I thought maybe my dear friend Dawn would loan me some, being that she was using Degree, which is a unisex deodorant. All I wanted was a few rubs in my pits. Not the whole stick. She said she would not let my pits touch her deodorant. I was highly insulted. So I had to rub the deodorant on my fingers and then rub it into my pits. Today, I did not put any deodorant on. It's already 12:30 pm and I don't think I have sweat once. Maybe I don't really need deodorant or anti-perspirant.  Anyway, shout outs are in order to my brother Rob who was happy to loan me a few rubs of his Old Spice Red Zone deodorant the last time I forgot my deodorant on my trip home.

      March 12, 2004 Lee's Palace Toronto, Ontario, Canada  Performers:  Danko Jones C'Mon Death from Above  I think Toronto is my favorite city in the world. It's clean, crime free, big (but not huge), and most importantly it's fun. I always have fun when I go to Toronto. It also has an excellent local music scene. Last night I went to Toronto with my friends Hannah, Fred, and Dave to see one of my favorite bands, Danko Jones. Danko always puts on an intense show, and they did once again last night. I was also extremely surprised with the two opening bands. Death from Above was a band consisting of only of a bassist and a drummer/vocalist. It was really primal and raw but it was excellent. Then C'Mon came on. C'Mon was a power trio (guitar, bass, drums). The lead guitarist/vocalist had a super long beard and super long hair and looked like Tom Hanks in Castaway. We just thought he was a roadie, then all of a sudden he came out on stage and started playing. You would think by his appearance that he would play some sort of Willie Nelson type mellow southern rock. But he played some fast, hard rock. He was flying all over the place for the whole show. He knocked down his microphone stand during the performance and then he picked up the mic and was playing the guitar with the pick and microphone in his right hand at the same time, and then when he need to sing he just put the microphone by his mouth. This went on for about one song until a guy came out on stage and gave him a new microphone stand. Also, the bassist was an attractive female who could really lean back like she was trying to win a limbo contest, all the while playing bass. Anyway, their music wasn't really awesome, but their performance was so I was pleased.  Then Danko came on. He didn't play any old songs. Only songs from "Born a Lion" and "We Sweat Blood". I really didn't like the album "Born a Lion", but now that I have seen the songs live I think it is extremely amazing. Danko puts on an excellent show, and the song "Mountain" was quite impressive. I don't feel like describing it. Just go to dankojones.net at the media section and you can watch a live performance of his to see what it's like.

      After months of searching my room, I finally found my two wristbands. Although these bands don't really have any monetary value, they have a great deal of sentimental value. Not to mention the fact that it's really been pissing me off that I was not able to find them. I found them in the pants pocket of a really tight pair of pants that I never wear. My "rock" bands will now assist me in extreme hand sweat prevention which will in turn assist me in even extremer rocking.

      I just finished shooting my scenes for the film short "Brotherly Love". The director was really pushing the cast and crew. We were shooting the scenes in a car, and I was driving. I had to drive with a super bright light in my face. My eyes hurt. It's worth it though because this will be the greatest film short of all time. It's only going to be like a 5 minute short and John took the about 2 hours of footage.  MavBavButav Productions

      I just returned from Franklin, Tennessee where I attended my brother Steve's high school graduation.   urlLink      At the graduation party, my band, The Ferkleys, performed a short set of covers and a couple of originals. The Ferkleys are:   Joe Ferguson - guitar, vocals Todd Merkley - bass Karl Merkley - drums  The set list was:  "I believe in a thing called love" by the Darkness "Longview" by Green Day **featuring John Ferguson on lead vocals**  urlLink      "Brotherly Love" (a Ferkleys original)  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     ______________________________________ At this point, the band took a break due to the fact that Todd had to leave to go skateboarding. The Ferkleys returned for a second set, this time with Aren Gerdon as guest bassist. Scott Ferguson also joined in to play lead cowbell. The second set of songs were:  "Undone" by Weezer "Dead Leaves on the Dirty ground" by the White Stripes "Say it ain't so" by weezer "Hotel Yorba" by the White Stripes "Going to a party" (impromptu blues explosion by the band) "Nicole" to the tune of "Jolene" by Dolly Parton "Fell in love with a girl" by the White Stripes "Proud Mary" by Creedence Clearwater Revival "Steve It's True" (another Ferkleys original)   urlLink      _______________________________________________ About 20 people attended the show. The jam session was awesome. The crowd roared like a lion. The show was a success. Pictures can be found at Joe's Pictures

      Friday night I went to see  urlLink Michael Moore 's "documentary" Farenheit 9/11.  It was a bunch of propaganda.  He could have made the exact same movie about himself.  While the movie did bring me a few chuckles, I think Michael Moore is just your typical complainer.  He complains for the sake of complaining.  A  urlLink lot  of  urlLink people  don't like him.  I don't think I do either.  But this blog is supposed to read like People magazine, not the New York Times.  So here is a great picture of my bedroom:   urlLink     And here is another:    urlLink       Saturday I didn't really do much of anything.  I took back some bottles to get my deposit.  Then I ate some guacamole and fell asleep.  Sunday was a joyous day.  First I went to chuch.  Then I went to  urlLink Earl's Drive In  Restaurant in Chaffee, NY with my Uncle Larry and Grandma Lucille.  Originally, we planned on taking the journey in my Uncle's recreational vehicle.  urlLink       Unfortunately, the brakes gave out before our journey began.  Here is a puddle of brake fluid from the vehicle.  urlLink     Luckily, we had alternate transportation, my Uncle's Grand Marquis.  urlLink     I drove.  urlLink     At Earl's, I ordered two of its specialties:  A beverage served in a jar and a delicious slice of apple crumb pie.  urlLink     Just prior to departure, we made sure to get our picture in front of the famous sign.  urlLink     In the evening, I went to the Schrock compound to engage in band practice.  I consumed two types of liquid refreshment.  urlLink

      Tonight was a fun filled evening.  First I started it by playing basketball with my good buddies.  This time my good buddy Amber joined the other good buddies that I played with the other day.    urlLink     She is a great player.  The game was fun, but unfortunately I bumped heads with Kazu.  We both have lumps on our heads (picture to be included later).    urlLink     After basketball, I hung out with my good buddies Fred, Dave and Sarah G.  Sarah G is a long time old friend from Canisius.  Here she is in Dave's car:  urlLink     Then Fred decided to look like he was drunk.  urlLink     After Fred got that out of his system, my cousin Joey thought that we (my cousin Danny, me, Joey, and Fred) should start a barbershop quartet.  This is a picture of us singing My Evaline.  urlLink     The fun didn't stop there.  Then Fred, Dave, Sarah and I went to play an intense game of miniature golf.  Unfortunately, the game was rained out, but fortunately we got vouchers for a free game for next time.  Here is a shot of the action.  urlLink     The Fun explosion went from miniature golf over to Chili's, where we enjoyed salsa and chips and beers.  Except for Fred, he only enjoyed salsa and chips, no beer.  After Chili's, we snapped a few photos in the parking lot.  This one looks fairly normal.  urlLink     But this one looks like Fred is being erased from existence.  urlLink      Well then the night had to end, so I came home to my dear grandmother and my cousins.  Here's a great shot of my cousin Maria and my grandmother having a non stop TV watching fun fest on the couch.  urlLink

       urlLink    Yesterday I played an extremely intense game of basketball with my good buddies Kazu, Li, Xiaowu, Adam, and Aimin.  The teams were:  Kazu, Li, and Joe vs. Adam, Xiaowu, and Aimin.  Adam, Xiaowu, and Aimin won the series, three games to one.  This is a photo of Aimin basking in the post victory glow of the orb that we refer to as a "basketball".  Fun was had by all.  Basketball is wonderful.  Good buddies are wonderful.  Life is wonderful.

      Monday began bright and early at 6:30 AM.  My flight was scheduled to depart at 9:10.  I was saddened that I had to leave the presence of my dear friend Dawn.  I eased the pain of her loss with a Bacon, egg, and cheese muffin and hash browns from McDonald's (the #2 breakfast value meal).  The beverage I selected was coffee.  At the Buffalo airport, I was greeted by my dear Uncle Larry and my dearest grandmother Lucille.  We enjoyed roast beef on weck at Charlie the Butcher's for lunch.  Then I returned to the chemistry lab to catch some of my fellow chemists hard at work.  My good buddy  urlLink Frigid Waters  started a blog after being inspired by me, and I documented this joyous event by photographing it.  Monday night I spent a good two hours updating my blog.  At this poing, blogs are anything but wonderful.  But life is wonderful.  And joyous.

      Sunday began with a delightful breakfast at Clark's restaurant in Brooklyn Heights.  Dawn had a waffle and I had Eggs Benedict and a fruit cup.  Then we went to the United Nations building.  I wanted to go there not because it was going to be exciting, but because I had never been there.  We didn't go inside, we just took some pictures from the outside.  After that 10 minutes of fun was over, we were at a loss at how to kill the rest of the day.  We started by going to Starbucks, but that was only worth another 5 minutes.  Then I requested to go to Guitar Center.  The Guitar Center in New York is a lot bigger than the one in Buffalo.  It also has a lot of cool vintage guitars that are worth like $80,000.  I played some guitars.  I played some songs for Dawn, but she made fun of me.  Then we left.  That was about an hour.  But it was a joyous hour.  Then we went to Soho to do some window shopping.  It was wonderful to see American capitalism at its finest.  Consumers consuming for the sake of consumption.  Then we were hungry.  I was in the mood for Mexican.  Dawn knew of a good Mexican restaurant but wasn't sure exactly where it was.  She called 411.  We got the address, but that didn't help us because we were in the West Village which has some crazy ass crooked avenues that mess your sense of direction up big time.  We kept walking.  Then I called information to confirm the location of this place.  The restaurant was called Tortilla Flats.  We finally found it.  It was all the way over about one block away from the water on the West Side.  It was worth the walk.  I had the Enchiladas Verdes and a margarita on the Rocks, and Dawn had the Enchiladas Mole and a blended margarita.  When we finished our meal, the waiter asked us if we wanted free shots.  We declined.  Then five minutes later we changed our minds.  Unfortunately we had already left the restaurant.  I called my wonderful father for Father's day to tell him this story, and he proclaimed that I must have a beer in honor of him at his favorite New York city bar, Hogs and Heifers.  It is a biker bar in the meatpacking district that is known for its skimpy dressed bartenders that get up on the stage and dance in Coyote Ugly fashion.  Dawn and I both had a Pabst Blue Ribbon, which I can say is almost as bad as Miller High Life.  After one Pabst, we left the bar feeling bloated and sick.  We also felt wonderfully content and joyous.  We finished the evening off by watching a wonderful movie starring Kate Hudson titled, "How to Lose a Guy in 10 days".  The Sunday was grand.

      On Saturday my dear brother Stephen and his wonderful girlfriend Nicole drove in from Mountaintop, PA to meet Dawn and I for a Saturday's worth of fun and excitement.  Since Nicole had never been to New York, the first thing we did was take her for a walk along the Brooklyn heights promenade, which has an excellent view of downtown Manhattan.  Then we took the Subway to Coney Island.  Dawn and I were expecting it to be bigger, but it wasn't really that big.  A small boardwalk, a few rides, and some beaches.  We saw an interesting game called "Shoot the Freak", which you could shoot a man with a paintball gun.  We also hippity hopped in the Atlantic ocean, ate some Nathan's Hot Dogs, watched a man shove a spoon in his nose, and rode the Cyclone.    After only a few hours in Coney Island, we went to Manhattan to do some hardcore sightseeing.  We saw Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, a pile of carriage horse pooh,  urlLink Kelly Packard in a restaurant , Ground Zero, and finally an unbelievable fireworks display.  Unfortunately, I did not have my camera to document this awesome fireworks display.  It was awesome because they did it from two barges in the water between Brooklyn and Manhattan.  All the flashing explosions reflected off of the skyscrapers.  It was excellent.  Despite the fact that I was unable to document this, the day was still wonderful, my brother and his girlfriend are wonderful, my dear friend Dawn is wonderful, and the day was wonderful.  When it was over, Steve and Nicole drove back to Mountaintop.

      On Friday, my dear friend Dawn only had to work a half day, so we were able to meet for lunch.  En route to our lunch destination we ran into some of Dawn's good buddies from her hometown.  We conversed with them and made plans to meet with them later in the evening.  For lunch, we decided to go to the recently renovated Time Warner Center, which contains, among other things a mall called  urlLink The Shops at Columbus Circle .  In this shopping center is a Wegmans like grocery store called Whole Foods complete with a Wegmans like Market Cafe.  I had sushi and Dawn had a stirfry dish.  After eating our meals, we decided to get some Jamba Juice brand fruit smoothies.  These smoothies made us feel extremely bloated while we shopped.  I suffered from such a great deal of digestional distress, that I had to relieve myself in the Time Warner building's luxurious bathroom facilities.  In the stall next to me, I saw the shadow of a man's hand going back and force in a stroking motion.  This led me to believe that he was pleasuring himself.  The thought of this, combined with the sighting of a rat in the subway, gave me the urge to take shower #2 of the day.  Luckily, Dawn was willing to accomodate this desire so we went back to her apartment.  We then had dinner at a new trendy restaurant in the Lower East Side called Schiller's Liquor bar.  I had the hamachi fish and Dawn had the steak frites.  For dessert, I had sorbet and Dawn had some sort of toffee pastry.  I don't remember what alcoholic beverage I had to accompany my meal, but I think it was some sort of whiskey sour.  Dawn drank something green.  It was a wonderful Friday.  It was a joyous lunch, and joyous dinner, but not a joyous restroom experience at the Time Warner building.  Fridays are wonderful.

      Then on Thursday evening I traveled by a US Airways flight from the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport to LaGuardia Airport in New York City. Unfortunately there was a huge thunderstorm in New York City, so my flight was delayed by about 4 hours. I didn't arrive to my dear friend Dawn's Brooklyn Heights apartment until 10:30 pm. We then walked to a local diner and enjoyed a late evening meal. I had a the BLT sandwich and Dawn had some sort of chicken sandwich containing several zesty spices.

      Sunday I went to the  urlLink Allentown Art Festival  with my good buddy Dave.  We saw lots of people:  The Bull from 103.3 the Edge, Tommy Z, Kristen O, Marty the dentist, Paulie D, the Smiths, and Robin S.  We walked around, enjoyed the lovely weather, enjoyed the fine art, enjoyed the wonderful food (sausage, cinnamon nuts, kettle corn popcorn), refreshing beverage (water, smoothies) and intelligent conversation.  Then, to top the evening off, we saw the movie  urlLink Saved! .  It was a joyous Sunday.  Saturday I went to my cousin Maria's dance recital.  It was a joyous celebration of dance.  Friday night I rocked out with some of my good buddies and potential bandmates:  Fred, Tim, Ryan, and Aaron.  What an absolutely fine weekend.  Friends are wonderful.

      As the race for president heats up, I have noticed that the majority of people are not very wise when deciding on who they vote for. This is not necessarily because I disagree with their politics, it is because I disagree with the way in which they decide their views. I think far too many Americans rely on unreliable sources to inform them vital political information. Many young people erroneously rely on a song or musician's statement when making their decision on who to vote for. Do musicians and entertainers know more about politics because they are famous? In most cases, the answer is no. Most entertainers are famous because they are good at one thing, and that is entertaining. This does not mean that they are intelligent and wise when it comes to politics. I will take the Rolling Stones for example. They had a song called "Street Fighting Man" that encouraged you to go out and violently protest your government. It's a rocking song, I will admit, but it does not make me want to go out and violently protest my government. Let's face it, the Rolling Stones wrote some kick ass songs, but otherwise they were messed up people. Keith Richards was/is a drunken drug addict, Bill Wyman dated a 13 year old, and Mick Jagger was just an all around womanizer. So, ultimately, these aren't the type of people that you want to be taking advice from.   A modern example of performers that make political statements that lack substance are the Beastie Boys. Their new album, "To the Five Boroughs", has a great deal of anti-Bush sentiment on it. It's a great CD, but like most Beastie lyrics, they don't make sense. Well actually, they make sense, but they don't really lead us to any conclusions. They don't like George Bush, this is clear, but do they have a solution to the problem, no?   "We got a president we didn't elect / Kyoto treaty he did neglect"   So what? I guess the rest of that particular song says a lot of other stuff, but I'm failing to get the message as to what the Beasties Boys suggest we do about these problems. I'm not saying that it is wrong for them to make political statements. The problem is uninformed young people are going to listen to this CD, and say to themselves, "If the Beastie Boys don't like George Bush, then neither should I. I am going to vote against him, for any candidate that is not George Bush." Nobody even cares what Kerry's platform is, they're just glad he's not Bush. That is retarded reasoning. These are the same people that go to see "Fahrenheit 9/11" and then decide that they aren't voting for George Bush. That movie was a piece of bias propaganda, but a large amount of people are making their decision based on this garbage.   It's not just liberals, it's conservatives too. People who religiously watch Fox News and believe everything the network states are not using their brains, they are allowing Fox News to think for them.   So anyway, my point is this, don't let other people make decisions for you. Make them for yourself. Also, don't vote for John Kerry simply because he's not George Bush. Vote for John Kerry because you think he is the best man for the job. In the spirit of my message, don't read this post and then base all of your political philosophies on what I say. I am only a chemist. Finally, I would like to state that I have not decided who I am voting for.

      This weekend I went to New York again to see my friend Dawn.  This time, my good buddy Dave came along because he had only been to New York once.

Then we walked along the Brooklyn Heights promedade for the scenery.  urlLink    Dawn and Dave with the Statue of Liberty in the background.  Then we went to a Turkish restaurant in Brooklyn where we were lucky enough to be entertained by a belly dancer.  For some reason Dave had an excellent knack for placing dollar bills in her outfit.  urlLink    Turkish restaurant belly dancer.  Then the dancer liked Dave so much that she asked him to dance with her.

On our way to the subway from Fuel at Pheobe's (where Crystal's party was), we encountered the bar Coyote Ugly (inspiration for the movie of the same name).  We were treated to some girls dancing on the bar.  We didn't stay long because we were tired.  urlLink    Coyote Ugly.  On Sunday morning, we started the day with some group discussion of Tolstoy.  Dawn led the discussion with her new glasses.   urlLink    Dawn being intellectual.  Then went to Grand Central Station.  urlLink    Dave and the Chrysler building.   urlLink    Grand Central Station.  Then we went to the top of the Empire State Building, which is an awesome place to take pictures.

       urlLink Michael Moore, Ugly American (washingtonpost.com)   This is really weird that this news came out because today as I was driving to work I was listening to Led Zeppelin thinking to myself, "To compare Led Zeppelin to the Who is completely preposterous.  Their styles are completely different.  Led Zeppelin is straight up balls to the wall heavy blues rock and The Who is yippy skippy heavy pop/punk rock with a few cool synthesizer noises every now and then.  Actually, I think the Who is more like arena rock.  John Bonham and Keith Moon have completely different styles.  Bonham's playing is a lot more heavy and bass heavy.  Jimmy Page is more of a riff player whereas Pete Townshend is the songwriter of the two guitarists.  Robert Plant's voice screams as if his life depended on it, whereas Roger Daltry screams as if he had future plans of appearing on Time/Life infomercials for Rock compilation albums.  The only thing that is the same between the two bands is the appearance of their lead singers.  In my opinion, the only thing that made Keith Moon's drumming all that special was the fact that he blew up his kit with some dynamite.  But I could do that and I don't even play drums."  In conclusion, it's pretty cool that Pete Townshend doesn't like Michael Moore, because neither do I, but that doesn't make the Who better than Zeppelin.  Led Zeppelin kicks my ass whereas the Who just tickles it a little bit.

I went because my good buddy Tim (member of the  urlLink Empire Statesmen ) was playing after the game.  The game was glorious.  The Red Wings won 2-1.   urlLink      Fred enjoyed sitting next to me.  urlLink     So did Jerry.  urlLink     I enjoyed munching on nuts.  Here are the shells.  urlLink     Here is a shot of downtown Rochester from in the inside of Frontier Field.  urlLink     A shot of the Statesment.  Tim is the fifth from the left.  urlLink     Fireworks were displayed after the Statesmen performed.  urlLink     A shot of the Kodak building taken with a digital camera.  How ironic.  urlLink      On Saturday I celebrated my cousin Danny's seventh birthday.  He invited some friends over.  urlLink     This is my cousin Joe, being larger than life.  urlLink     The birthday boy with his brother Joe and sister Maria.  urlLink     Blowing out the candles.  urlLink     UJ stands alone.  urlLink     Joe and Joe rocking.  urlLink     Pinatas are great for parties.  urlLink     Danny got a drum set for his birthday.  This is a pic of him rocking it extremely hard.  urlLink     As the evening wound down, we sat and enjoyed a campfire.  urlLink      Sunday, July 4th was spent with family.  First with the Fergusons. Cathy and Al.  urlLink    Then the Priores.  Larry and The Blonde (Linda).  urlLink     LP Jr., LP Sr., and Joe.  urlLink      Monday I went to work for a little bit and then hung out with friends.  We saw the movie Spiderman 2, which was awesome.  Dave took a shot from the back seat of my car.  Look at my eyes in the mirror.  urlLink     This is another shot Dave took of my rear end.  urlLink     Dave contemplating the menu at Outback Steakhouse.  urlLink     Fred also took pictures.  urlLink      The weekend was wonderful.  Although I would have preferred for it to last longer, the weekend was refreshing and delightful. There was a lot of good food, fellowship and of course, a fair amount of movie watching.

      Last night I went to Buffalo's weekly outdoor free concert, Thursday at the Square.  The band that played was called Blue Rodeo.  I didn't really listen.  They were nothing special in my opinion.  For some reason there were a lot of motorcycles at this particular Thursday at the Square.  urlLink     I was with my good buddies Fred and Tim.  Bradley E found us.  Dave found us.  Then Fred found Elizabeth G (sister of Sarah G).  Then they posed for photos.  Here is Dave, Brad, Elizabeth, and Fred.  urlLink     Elizabeth and Fred.  urlLink     Brad found some people he knew and I observed their conversation photographically.  urlLink     We were surrounded by buildings.  urlLink     Tim was surrounded by women.  urlLink     Tim scored some digits.  urlLink     We then began a journey to the Pearl Street Bar & Grill.  On our journey, I observed this interesting bumper sticker.  urlLink     At Pearl Street we drank some beers, ordered chicken fingers, listened to Strictly Hip (a Tragically Hip cover band), and played air hockey.  urlLink      urlLink     Tim was still surrounded by women.  urlLink     While we were still playing air hockey.  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      Fun was had by all.

      Last night I went to the Schrock compound for some band practice.  After band practice, I began taking several pictures that I was taking for no other reason then to put them on my blog.  First I took a panoramic shot of Tim's room that we practice in.  urlLink     Then I took a shot of the drumset.  urlLink     Then I took a shot of some pictures on Tim's ceiling.  The one on the left is a shot of the Schrock children in 1996.  The portrait above it is of the famous Mike Slagor of Akron, New York, and next to him is a portrait of Eddie Van Halen.  Finally, the picture on the far right is the Schrock family portrait from 1996.  urlLink     Here is an Albert Einstein poster.  urlLink     Here is Tim's window sill.  urlLink     Here is a shot of Fred blowing his nose.  urlLink     The next few shots demostrate my ability to have fun without the participation of others.  These pictures all incorporated the use of the ten second timer feature on my camera.  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     This last picture is of Tim laughing extremely hard at the fact that I just spit out a whole lot of water out of my mouth.  I tried to get a photo of me chugging a bottle of water as fast as I could but what happened was that I put too much water in my mouth and started to gag on it and spit it out.  So instead of getting a shot of me chugging water, I got a shot of me choking on it.  urlLink     This is the post water embarrassment in all its glory.  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      That's it.  Fun with photography.  ADIOS.
