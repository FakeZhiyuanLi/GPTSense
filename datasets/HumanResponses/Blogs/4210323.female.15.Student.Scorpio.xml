      I can almost see the star Feel its light shining through Only a few more steps And I will be free, once more I can almost taste my freedom Relief from all the pain The pain which I, myself had created. I can almost hear the laughter The priceless gift, God gave I can almost smell the flowers, A new bud blooming each day.  But suddenly, all becomes black Everything is dark again Just as it was before I have lost the radiant star I can no longer feel its light I’ve lost my way, the path has gone Once again, I am hopeless I have no purpose, I have no use I am nothing but an empty soul, A body with no spirit within.  I am alone in this tragic place I am apart from my companions I am helpless, i am paralyzed I am cursed by this world! Am I ever to see my dreams? Am I never to feel happiness? Am I ever to taste freedom? Am I never to hear my voice? Will this agony ever cease?  Then, I realized, this was all me, i was never cursed. I was able to see the star Because I had opened my eyes, I had let them see me, I had set them free. Everything became black Because I had closed my heart, I had let fear overcome me, I had let fear keep them out.  Now, I am no longer alone. I have found myself, I have found my companions. The world is finally with me.

       The creature I fear the most has returned That neither Love nor Hate could ever destroy The creature that even in the face of Death, Will not shiver nor even sweat.  Wishing and praying will only prove futile For there is no escape and no where to hide I have sought for Ignorance and for Oblivion But both did nothing but disappoint me.  If its shadow is still lurking   Then I have no choice but to fight But I can never let it take Victory Or hell on earth will be my destiny.

        Ever since we met, Ever since we became friends, My life has been so much better. Yes, my problems are still here They’re still hard to face. And perhaps they'll never disappear But knowing that you’re here with me, Makes everything easier to bear. I realize, that if we have never met Right now, I wouldn’t be here You say that you never really cared Or that you never really helped But you also say that you’re useless And yet you’re always there when I’m a mess You also say you never do anything But you never stopped listening You also say you’re not a good friend But you always had a free hand to lend and a shoulder for me to cry on The fact that you were there and that you never left me Meant more to me than anything else If you still don't believe me Then there’s nothing I can ever say or do To make you believe this is all true But even if you refuse to believe, just remember That for everyday that I’m alive It’s all thanks to you, and that’s not a lie.

        It’s something I felt before It’s something I don’t want anymore It’s something that made me break The feeling I could never take The only thing that could touch my heart And make it as precious as art The only thing that could my buy soul And fill the growing empty black hole It’s confusing that I want it to stay Yet pray for it to go away The first time I felt it, I happily embraced it. Oblivious to what it could be I freely gave it to he. Once more, I feel it again. I should know what to do, But I’m much more confused. Should I tell you what I feel? Or should I keep it unrevealed? If I tell you would you accept? Or my offer would you reject?

        When we first saw you, We never liked you. But still we gave you a chance But you drew out a lance. If it’s a fight you want, It’s a fight you’ll get Because you’ve made us mad And we want you to suffer by our hand You caused others injuries To cover up your insecurities On us, you look down As if you’re wearing a crown Who are you to give us our place? Who are you to choose our fate? You will never be our fear. Challenge us and you will die by a spear.

       I was walking down the road of life Faced with hardships I wanted to end I was in the middle of a struggle I thought I could handle on my own Months passed and I was still stuck Not being able to move in any way When I heard footsteps behind me I turned around but saw no one. After a while, I started to ask. Where are my friends? Why were they not with me? Why am I alone? I started to cry, I couldn’t handle it anymore Hot tears rolled down my cheeks I decided I would stop loving, Stop caring for people who didn’t care about me Who was never behind me nor ever will I started to give up, I started to lose hope I got a knife from my pocket When I heard footsteps following me Once again, I turned around But there was no one behind me I looked at the knife then to my hand When I felt a soft tap on my shoulder I looked beside me and there you were That’s when I realized, you didn’t abandon me You were walking beside me all along It was only me, who didn’t see Because I refused to look beside. But I was right, you know, You were never behind me nor will you ever be Because you were and will always be beside me Just like I will always be beside you.

       Since the day I was born I have loved you I didn’t really know you back then But I knew you were somebody whom I loved Whatever you did to me No matter how much it hurt I could bear Because deep inside, I knew that you loved me And with that thought, I knew I could face anything You’ve criticized me, you’ve hurt me, you’ve cursed me But these things didn’t matter When you loved someone as much as I loved you A few years passed, And it’s only now I realize, That you were never really who I thought you were And you never felt what I thogught you felt All those times that we spent together Sharing smiles and laughing at eachothers stories Was all fake, nothing but a set up Thinking that, it hurt me It hurt me enough that I wanted to die I can’t believe I’ve been so stupid So stupid to believe that you’ve loved me all these years But still, I don’t hate you I mean, how could i? You are my mother after all. But just because I don’t hate you It doesn’t mean that I still love you Because I don’tAnd I never will, again
