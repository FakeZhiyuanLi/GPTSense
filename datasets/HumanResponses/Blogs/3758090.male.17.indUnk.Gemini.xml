      would you believe me if i said i love you even though i really don't would you laugh and spit at my face or cry full of damn shame  for all the times you hurt me how could i still feel for you now all i have is pain and hate let me just show it to you  i take something hard and long smash it hard against your face something, shiny, sharp and silver is what i use to half your waist  you scream for help, but none comes they can't hear you with a slit throat your blood's everywhere, on everything i laugh and shout, "how you gonna play me now bitch"  i sit on the floor, sweat mixed with blood looked at what i did, can't believe i feel none but wait... i feel it in my heart, only for you could it be that i am now falling in love with you?

      here it is again  don't know if it's right to feel this way again  cuz i'm fed up with all this  spinning inside my head   in the realm of craziness  i'm stuck here with regret  i have to pack this up now  cuz this will be the end   i'm holding on this tightly  but it's slipping off my hand  still full of confusion  will this be another end   i might never feel this way again  if doing this i will push through  i'll take a deep breath, hit my skin  slide it hard, until it bleeds   one moment of pleasure  can bring an eternity of distress  the depression that i treasure  in my hand i will caress   cuz i'm sick of all this inside  i wanna make it stop  not much else to think i'll do  than to slit my wrists and die   my palm's trembling  i guess this is it  i close my eyes, breathe in hard  till the pain sinks in   my heart's beating faster  i'm sweating all over  i hear my mom on my door  pounding, screaming, "please, no more"   i lose everything that i sense  concentrate on ending this  it is my time, i'll deal with it  cuz this is what i've always wished   for me to struggle with so much  is only i can take  AAAAGH!!!  i'll succumb to the pain  and let it take me to my final......................................

        i've been called a whore, a bitch, a slut    i've sucked off all the guys at school, fucked a couple dudes    i'm good at getting into guys' pants    but bad at keeping their hearts     &nbsp;   they worshipped me for my hand and my tongue    adored me for my sexy body, tight ass and big juggs    but no one has ever told me i was kind    no one has ever complimented what i was really like     &nbsp;   i'm always seen as this sexual object    which i know has been degrading    i guess it's fine cuz if not, i suspect    not one guy would ever, at me, keep looking     &nbsp;   and now, the prom is to start in a few hours    i sat by the phone all day and waited for any suitor    i'm hurting deep inside as i looked at my dress    cuz i can't believe no one has asked me out, in solace     &nbsp;   what's wrong with me? or what's wrong with them?    i gave them my body, the next day, they don't care    they'll be sorry, i know they will    cuz after i'm done with this, they won't have a bitch to fuck with

        i'm lying on my bed    a bottle of pills in my hand    think of what i'm about to do    is this what i want?     &nbsp;   i look at each and every picture    see how happy i once was    but look deeper than the smiles    you'll see the depth of my pain inside     &nbsp;   i take one pill, then three, then ten    i grab a glass of water and wash it all down    looked at the ceiling, this might be my last glimpse    i closed my eyes then relaxed    and waited for death to take me     &nbsp;   it's true, what people say,    "your whole life flashes before you when you die."    i see each and every memory, from childhood till my suicide    a white light flashed before me, but i ran away from it    the darkness is where i want to be    all alone, i will die
