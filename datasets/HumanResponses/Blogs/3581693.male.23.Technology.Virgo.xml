      Many of you are probably wondering how Bob got her name.  Well it's quite simple really - back in December of 2000 when she came into my posession - I wanted to call her the Silver Bullet.  Well that name was already taken by J. Salon's Toyota Minivan - so I had to come up with something else.  So I got to thinkin'... hmmmmmm ...   The Silver Bullet...  The Silver Bullet Band  Bob Segar and the Silver Bullet Band  Simply shortened to ... Bob.  And there you have it - her name is Bob.

      Alrighty - I think it's pretty safe to say that musical interests are probably one of the most diverse things about us as humans.   I myself have a very shallow musical interest. That is I don't like too many different types of music.   I find most music is tollerable to a certain extent.  One point of interest about my musical interests is the fact that I enjoy Elton John. For the longest time I was ashamed to admit it. Because he's gay. But then again so was Freddy Murcury - Queen - and millions of men sing along to his songs at sporting events each and every day.   So - anyways now that I'm nearly 24 - I think it's time I stopped being ashamed to admit that he is one of my favorite artists. He's very talented.  I went to one of his shows once. It was just him and a Piano at GM Place. It had to have been one of the best shows I've ever seen. 3 hours of just him and the piano - mind blowing.  So there you have it... I am self-confident... proud of my interests.   Hey after all it's me!

Girl "Yeah?"  Guy "Maybe we could do eachother."  Girl "What? You crazy moth*%$%!#$^!#$@^!#@$%!@#$ guy."  Guy "Oh - did I say eachother? I meant to say watch one another do someone else."  Girl "You must be out of your go#$%#@$%^@#$#!@#$%^^$$%$!@#$%."  Guy "Oh - did I say watch one another do someone else? I meant to say do something with some other people. Maybe go see the fireworks?"  Girl "Oh - okay."  The end.

      Last summer - my drunken escapades were indeed limited... I worked a lot and of course school - so sufficed to say when I got drunk it happened very fast - and the animal in me came to life.  So there we were - the guys out for a night of drinking downtown. There may have been 1 girl with us... maybe two...  Anyways I'm nice an' wasted - this time in my head I became a super athlete.   I ran off ahead of the group - and jumped over some bushes and hid behind them.  Then some loud mouth punks start yellin' out of the window of a cab at me - "HEEEY MAN!!"  I stand up - ready to fight ( Note: I've never been in a fight in my life ) - "You want some?!?! HUH? HUH?"  "No man - not at all - you're tree guy - we won't mess with tree guy"  Alright so now we're cool - and I'm tree guy... so I take of like a rocket - must have been going mach 40 up robson.  I could hear the ladies on the street saying "ooooooh - aaaaaaah - look at tree guy go - oh I want Tree Guy"  Well, honestly I can't remember whether it was the ladies or if it was the guys yelling at me "Hey tree guy - where you going?!?!"  Either way - tree guy was born that hot summer night in downtown Vancouver.

      I have recently noticed that I can't help but look at moving objects when they cross my line of sight. Is this normal?  I think the problem lies with the clarity of my vision. When I look away to see what it is that is moving - it takes me a while to figure out what I'm looking at / to get the picture in focus. Maybe I should get my eye's tested.  Or it could be the fact that the moving objects are tall leggy blondes and it takes a few seconds to get the whole picture. ;P  Maybe I'm just a people watching fanatic.  Or maybe I didn't want the person sitting across from me to think I was "staring" - but I guess that wouldn't have been an entirely bad thing - hmmmmmmm - something to think about.

      "My Maltese is SMARTER than your HONOR Student"  Being an Honor Student myself, I would like to challenge her Maltese to a battle of wits!  Now I know this will never happen - but still - what kind of person actually thinks that way - enough to put it on the back of her Suzuki Sunrunner.  I hollered out at them as I turned into my subdivision - I'M WAAAAAAAAAAY SMARTER THAN YOUR DOG!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA     Okay, no I didn't - but I thought about it - but I came to the conclusion that I would be a bigger dog if I didn't say anything at all.

      Baby I see this world has made you sad  Some people can be bad  The things they do, the things they say  But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears  I'll chase away those restless fears  That turn your blue skies into grey   Why worry, there should be laughter after the pain  There should be sunshine after rain  These things have always been the same  So why worry now   Baby when I get down I turn to you  And you make sense of what I do  I know it isn't hard to say  But baby just when this world seems mean and cold  Our love comes shining red and gold  And all the rest is by the way   Why worry, there should be laughter after pain  There should be sunshine after rain  These things have always been the same  So why worry now  - Dire Straits

      So I'm at my cousin's wedding last night - seeing family that I hadn't seen in a while.  My younger cousin Dakota - he's 11 now - used to idolize me when he was 7-8ish... never the less, he discovered a golf cart parked way off to the edge of the ranch. He had been trying to get someone to go with him to ride it. He couldn't get any takers - until he came to me.   Obviously the little man was afraid of getting caught - and he figured that if he had an adult with him - he couldn't get in trouble.  Always one for a little bit of adventure - I go along with him to the golf cart. He would like to drive - so I figure I'll be the passenger - not too many options.  Anyways, within two seconds - he had the thing in reverse and he just puts his foot on the gas peddle. The thing just rockets backwards - into a ditch.  I'm thinking - hmmmmm - no problem - first time should be a little rocky... let's show him how to go forward.  Nope - not happening - the golf cart is now stuck. The rear wheels just spin as if they are stuck in the mud. There's just some grass underneath them.   I say to myself - we need some friction under the wheels. There's not much around to choose from - so I get some rocks - and have him try again.  Left a nice burnt rubber mark on the rock. Then we tried some cardboard - dumb idea.  After about ten minutes of trying and getting all nice and sweaty - I decide to give up. It was a good effort - but the golf cart wasn't meant to be ridden.   Of course I have to take the blame for the whole situation - thank goodness it didn't come down to that...  Dakota obviously had no problem telling people that it was me who got the golf cart stuck - trying to save his own ass or something - he didn't need to - oh well, a couple more years experience and he'll learn that ignorance is bliss.  In the end the owner of the place had to get a tractor out to get it unstuck - and many people said to me waaaay to go Shaun.  Meh - all in a good day's work.

      Okay - I'm conflicted.  Recently I have gotten drunk on a couple of occasions - and well the first few or two times I think I enjoyed myself - those evenings went smoothly - everyone had a good time - I had a good time - no complaints. Afterwards I slept pretty well - I wouldn't even say that I was cranky at all.  Last night however - completely different story. I had a few beers - some awesome Chicken and Steak - who could ask for more? Cranky Shaun could - holy cow! I dunno what exactly it was but my attitude went down hill very fast. I became so moody. I was a little whinny baby. And for what? I dunno - and then today it just continues... I have a bit of a headache - I feel so upset about drinking last night - like it was the worst thing I could have done. I tried to fix it with some retail therapy - of course they have nothing in my size. The whole shopping experience was a bit of a chore - then I decided to get a hair cut - get rid of the black which is now just pissing me off - holy uneven dye job - it's all gone now - I'm back to my beautiful blonde! So it looks like I'm heading in the right direction - things are picking up - what else do I need - FLOYD! Pink Floyd - the Dark Side of the Moon - what a great album! Who needs mind altering drugs or alcohol when you've got floyd!   Anyways - I guess it's just good that I am aware that I am in a terrible mood - and I have found something to help me out of it. It's ok to be a baby every now and then!  Conclusion - Not To Drunk - the test is on!

      Is it getting better, or do you feel the same? Will it make it easier on you, now you got someone to blame? You say one love, one life, when it's one need in the night. One love, we get to share it  Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.  Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth? You act like you never had love and you want me to go without. Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light. We're one, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other, carry each other... one  Have you come here for forgiveness,  Have you come to raise the dead Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head Did I ask too much, more than a lot You gave me nothing, now it's all I got. We're one, but we're not the same. Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again.  You say love is a temple, love a higher law Love is a temple, love the higher law. You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.  One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should. One life with each other: sisters, brothers. One life, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other, carry each other. One, one.  - Bono

      I for one have had enough of Sleep Country's patronizing advertisements - do they think we're stupid or something? "Well you know, Serta said the more you buy the bigger the discount!" No Sh!t Sherlock - the more you buy of anything the bigger the discount the supplier is going to give you - have they lost all creativity in advertising? They have been running the same ad forever! I say it's time for a change...

      I think it's pretty safe to say that the best nights - the ones that are the most fun - cannot be planned. I like to call these "The nights where I fly by the seat of my pants!"  So it's Friday night - what are we going to do? - as usual we're a little indecisive - not a problem. Start rounding up the troops - and eventually something good is bound to happen.  A couple of friends - 8 or so "Brother's of the Cult" finally end up going to Moxies Bar and Grill. Damn drink specials! 710mL bottles of Corona and Heineken for $6.55 - that's insane. If this isn't trouble in a bottle, I dunno what is!  She said she didn't know me - she said I was sweet... but anyways...  I managed to finish half of one of the Heineken's - and I was gooned. I think the waitress laced it with something - she wanted me - baaaaaaaaaaaad - little did she know - that all she had to do was ask. But anyways - I manage to finish off 3 of the tall ones... and I could still walk. Then the leader of the cult gets me involved in some cult like activities in the parking lot. I played the fly on the wall for a bit - the wall was a window though - I think the girls inside dug the fly.  And now we're off to a party - at a very nice house - large back yard - that a bunch of Christians are hosting - Christians are fun people!  I go inside the house - to the kitchen. This beautiful girl spots me... pipes up - "Hi, how are you?" Completely blown away by her forwardness - she must be drawn to my new muscular physique - that's the only reason she'd be talking to me - of course - score. Little did I know that she was just bait - to the biggest Christian Venus fly trap ever! So I start talking to her - and she asks me "Who are you? Who are you hear with?" Oh I'm here with Justin - who knows Matt... little did I know that they were unsure of who Justin was. All of a sudden I'm meeting the rest of the people in the kitchen - somehow they're all family members - who'd have thought! Even mom was there - "Oh and this is Mom - why don't you go say Hi" Naturally drawn to the older types - I start telling her about the last time I was at her house - and she asks "Oh were you at the party where the chair came through the kitchen window?" PAUSE Hmmmmmmm - No, I don't remember that happening. You had a chair thrown through your window? That's crazy - but you know - kids these days eh - get a little wild at times. Anyways, at this point I've had enough fun talking to the old goat - so I make my way towards the door to go find my gang again. I'm stopped at the door - by one of the "family members" who looks nothing like the rest of the family. "Hey" he says, "I'm so and so" - I'm like yeah we just met - 5 minutes ago... he's like oh yeah - so who are you? I'm Shaun - I know Justin who know's Matt who's house this is - your brother I'm assuming. Wow this is turning into a game of 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon. He's like - who's Justin... I'm like - Justin - knows Matt - are you even listening to me? You're not going to win the game if you don't pay attention. He's like you better come with me. I'm completely shocked at how difficult for them this is to understand. He wants me to go talk to mama again... I'm now rushed into a back room where Mama is waiting for me. The room is basically filled by this huge bed - mama is standing beside it. Could this be some weird kind of cult initiation - a "Christian taking" as it were - little did they know I've already be taken by many Christians, so this would be nothing new. However, now I'm slightly frightened due to the fact that I'm now surrounded by two Christians next to a large bed - they just keep questioning me as to who Justin is - they need to find out who he is before they'll feel comfortable with me in their house - why not just ask me to leave - now I'm trapped until they find out who he is - I can't leave!!! They're like buddy you stay here - mama is going to go and find Justin... I'm finally reunited with my buddies - and Justin is nowhere to be found. Great - now we're all trapped!! Thank god there's no bonfire going - I'd have been burned for being an outsider. 15-20 minutes pass and mama never comes back... we decide to make a run for it - leave... the Christian guard is now gone. We find Justin and he's like "What did you do?"  Nothing! I did nothing... I just walked into the Kitchen and was taken aback at how friendly they were - the new me - trying new things thought I'd try talking to new people! Little did I know they were just policing the party - bunch of crazy Christians - you shouldn't open your doors to guests and then torture them!   Never again!

      I think I should say - that I'm almost done being a stuck-up male chauvinist pig... all this talk about my new body, and new attitude may seem a little much - but honestly I want to be a sweet and loving man - there are just some things that one needs to get off ones chest. So I hope those of you out there who know me and are women don't take any of this in the wrong way - just trying to have a little fun is all ... ...

      I was once told that I am good at everything I do - to which my reply was - well that's because I only do things I'm good at.  There are a lot of things that I suck at - I think I need to do more of them - well more often anyways.  I get bored so quickly with things - I learn how to do new things - pick it up really quickly - and then I get bored of it. This can obviously be quite a downer.  Take this week at work for example - I was logging cases like crazy - I was a case loggin' foo'... I then found myself sitting around with nothing to do (but blog)... but then I realized - the resolution to my problem was to take on new challenges - not to be so afraid. This is one of the things that I like most about myself - is my ability to pick up new things - so I just need to do them more often.  Earlier today I was faced with a problem - and the one person who normally fixes it - is off. I went running around trying to find someone to fix it. Of course - no one would - this was at first a little upsetting - and then I thought to myself - I'm going to fix this - and I got my nose into it and voila - I solved the problem - made some women very happy - and I even felt great inside.   I am a very capable person - I just sometimes fear the unknown.

      Now I've always been one to brag - I've certainly never been shy in this area - as a matter of fact I come fully equipped with an inflatable ego. Now I can't say that I came to be this way all on my own - oh no no no - you see, I come from a long line of excellent males who know how to blow their own horn - and rightfully so - in most cases. So I must say, I'm extremely fortunate to have been born into this family. That in mind - let me begin.   So I've been going to the gym now for a little over 8 months - and boy am I ever impressed with the results. Especially recently, I started doing a routine - focusing on certain parts of the body each time I go. Let me tell ya - this is contagious - I can't get enough of it. Well ladies and gentlemen - especially ladies - in about a month - my new nick name will be Shaunicus Maximus - God of Surrey and surrounding areas.  Anyways - me sleepy - I'll discuss egos further at a later date...  ... Lately, however, I've noticed that I have become a bit of an introvert. WHAT? Shaun is an introvert... this shouldn't come as any surprise - there have been comments dating as far back as grade 3 about Shaun being shy - thanks Jamie Fraser. So how can someone who is so shy and introverted have much of an ego - no one really knows. So do I have a huge ego? Maybe not huge - there's always room for expansion.   So that's what I'm going to do - EXPAND! - after all, I do have a lot to brag about. I think that if I start working with my ego in everyday situations I will become more successful. Friends and coworkers will enjoy being around me, women will fall head over heals for me - I truly will have it all! As one of my good friends put it - you need 3 things to be successful - Money, Attitude and Muscles - The MAM effect.   By nature, I am a cheap bastard - so this should help take care of the money issue - once I learn how to spend it of course. Muscles - as afore mentioned - gimme a month or two and I'll be trim, cut and ready to go! And that leaves attitude - I do need to work on this. Let me think - my introvertedness has caused me to focus a lot of my energy on inner thoughts - I tend to keep them to myself - and never act on impulses. Now I could go from one extreme to another here and act on every impulse I have - but that would leave me slightly unprotected. Of course - if that is my only fear - being unprotected - then maybe going to the extreme is what I need to do.  My way of conversing has become too reactive. I need to take initiative and become the person people think I am (upon first sight) - and start conversations. I have nothing to be shy about. So anyways... all that's left to do now is get started...

      OK, so some of you may have heard the story - but for those of you who haven't here it is - in it's entirety!  So the evening starts with a group of friends - enjoying some laughs at a downtown comedy club. Many drinks were consumed - many a gut was burst.  It was after 12 when the group of hott youngin's returned to a downtown hotel, where much more booze was consumed. The group embarked on a somewhat lackluster game of Truth or Dare. One by one they fell asleep. Alas, there was but two left - it's now 4 am.  One friend - we'll call him J - asks his friend S if he wants to go get some breakfast. Unable to sleep, S willingly obliges. So they enter the lobby of the hotel and ask the concierge "what's a good place for breakfast?" - "McDonalds serves a mean breaky he replies" - S & J decide to find something a little easier on the old tum tum - so off they go - out into the rain.  J walking slightly ahead of S. It wasn't but a second before a sharpely dress young man spoke up and asked J "are you Mr. Green?" Without missing a beat - J replied "yes that's me." "Okay, right this way sir." Up goes the umbrella and he's escourted through the door of a limo. S, not wanting to second guess J's judgement, hops right in after him.   Driver "Will you be bringing any bags?"  Mr. Green "No no, they'll be travelling separately."  Driver closes the trunk and hops in.  Mr. Green "Could you please put the divider up? We'd like some privacy."  Driver complies, starts the car and starts driving.  S looks at Mr. Green - simply starts laughing. It's too early to think.   S "Where are we going?"  Mr. Green "I have no idea. I'll ask him to drive through McDonalds"  S "No - you can't do that" (S always the voice of reason).  Mr. Green "How do I turn on the radio?"   They start playing with things. Eventually get the radio going, air conditioning turned way up. They sit back an enjoy the ride. Both of them completely relaxed at this point - no idea where they're heading.  Their minds begin to ponder - Mr. Green "I bet we're going to the airport"  S "Oh, I bet we're going to be taken right out on to the air strip - the jet will be waiting."  Mr. Green "Ok - if that's the case - we just keep walking - get on the plane and go - don't look back. This'll be like a chance for a new beginning."  S "Ok. But what if the real Mr. Green was a made man - and we're going to be taken to some mob bosses place and off'd?"  Mr. Green looks at S - "Ok Mr. Mustard let's not get carried away - I don't wanna have to ask the driver to stop off and get me some rope before taking us to the library."  Now a good 20 minutes have passed. This is about the time it takes to get from downtown to the airport. Sure enough they can see the airport.  All of a sudden there's a knock on the divider.  Mr. Mustard "Dude, he's knocking."  Mr. Green "No he's not."  Knock knock...  Mr. Mustard "Yes he is."  Mr. Green turns down the radio and opens the divider. "Yeah what's up?"  Driver "You're not Mr. Green. The Green party never got picked up. I just got a call from my boss."  Mr. Green "You're kidding me. That's impossible. I'm Mr. Green."  Driver "Well there's a Mr. Green who called my boss stating he never got his limo."  Mr. Green "So, wait. There's two Mr. Greens - expecting to get picked up at the same time. This is unbelievable. What are the chances. All I know is that my parents told me to get up, into a limo and out to the airport for flight 151. I don't ask questions, I just do it. Everything was prepaid."  Note: the car is still moving...  Driver "Nothing was prepaid. You have to pay for this when I drop you off."  Mr. Green "That's impossible. I don't have any money on me."  Driver "Well then I'll have to let you out right here" (Somewhere along the side of the road).  Mr. Green "I'm not paying for this thing. This isn't my limo. I don't know who you are or where you're from but you better let me out right now. If you go five more feet this will be kidnapping. Stop the car."  The care doesn't stop.  Mr. Green "Stop the car. I want to talk to the Canadian authorities. I'm an American. I want you to take me to the embassy."  Driver "You want to talk to the RCMP?"  Mr. Green "Yes - take me to the authorities. The RCMP!"  Driver "There's one right here."  Mr. Mustard "Oh Sh*t!"  The limo pulls into a gas station where there is an RCMP car being filled up.   The driver jumps out. Mr Green jumps out and follows him to the officer and they start talking to him through the window.  Mr. Mustard hangs out around the shop - talking to the locals - then dashes inside (for the warmth).  Mr. Green "This man has kidnapped me. He picks us up. Doesn't check who we are - just starts driving and taking us where he wants. Totally unacceptable. I have no phone. I have no money. I'm stuck."  Driver "Here, you can use my phone to call your parents and see what they booked."  Mr Green reluctantly takes the phone and starts dialing random numbers - with no success. "I've had enough - you're going to make me late for my flight - I'm going to get my friend."  Comes into the shop while signalling for Mr. Mustard to hide out of sight.   Mr. Green "I need $42 to pay for the limo." Now realizing that this is not just going to go away.  Mr. Mustard "I've only got $20."  Mr. Green "That's fine give it to me... take my wallet and phone - I've told them I don't have any so I don't want them to find it on me."  Mr. Green takes the money out to the limo driver who is all of a sudden his best friend again. "Now take us to the airport. You've nearly spoiled our honeymoon. I won't let you do any more damage."  They get to the airport and the limo driver opens the doors.  Mr. Green "Hey buddy let me ask you something. Is your job worth $40? Cause this just cost you your job. Say hi to your wife for me when you're stuck working at 7-11!" And the two young highjackers head inside for breakfest.  Unable to find what they were looking for near American departures they start heading for a timmies in Domestic departures. Uncertain of how they are going to get home they get on their cell phones and start calling friends. Who happens to be walking towards them but the RCMP officer.  RCMP "Gentlemen, American departures are in that end" Points in the opposite direction.  Mr. Green "Well you know what we missed our flight because of that whole ordeal."  RCMP "Oh yeah, well why don't you come with me and we'll get this sorted out. What flight were you on?"  Mr. Green "Oh 151... " Mr. Green continues to talk leaving the officer no choice but to suspect something is up.   Mr. Mustard "Ok I think it's time you come clean this has gone far enough." Not wanting to get arrested - of course.  Mr. Green "Ok Ok" - Explains the whole story to the officer. Officer now smiling. "Surely when you were 21 you did the same thing?"  Now he wants to check both Mr. Green and Mr. Mustard for warrants. (At this point they start using their real names).   S gets the 1010 all clear... and after some fixing of information - so does J.  Officer says happily (obviously going to bust a gut later) "Ok guys - Behave!"  Now S & J have to get a taxi (as they just missed the bus) back to the hotel to return the key... thus ends a wild night of good times!

      Times change. Music changes. Do we change as often as music does? I'm not talking about every 3 minutes on the radio. I mean the trends of music. It wasn't that long ago that MC Hammer was the biggest name on pop radio. He even did a show in Penticton. It was great... I mean... I heard some guys walking down the street once talking about it being great. Anyway - around that time I gained the self imposed nick name MC Shauny Boy. And this was super cool (in a ghetto Surrey white-boy rapper kinda way). In fact - it spawned a cartoon series - MC Shauny Bee - all copies of this have been destroyed... a tragic trash bin fire in the 90's. There was a rash of them around that time. Now I have a new name in the rap world... Shaundiggity. Still a little 90's - but with some black hair I make it work. Now the black hair is fading and it's time to come up with a new nick name. DigitalShaundiggity is kinda catchy but will it last. I need something a little more classic rock. Something that stands the test of time. Something that tells a tale of what an exceptional lover I am. OK maybe not that - that's something I sort of want to keep to myself. I need something that whispers sweet nothings into the ears of beautiful, young women as they lay on the sand under the scorching sun. OK - whoops I lost my train of thought there. I sort of enjoyed that, but I must continue. Is it fair for me to come up with my own nick name? Shouldn't my friends do this? I leave this question with you...

      So it's nearly summer. My favorite time of year. The temperature is rising. It's time to put on the shades and flip on some tunes. These thoughts and many more pass through my head as I sit in my dark room - doors closed - curtains drawn - at my computer. As I sit here with a tummy full of food - I look for inspiration. I want to follow my friend Amn's lead ( urlLink Kwyjibo Classic ) - and compose a blog so spectacular, so amusing, so thought provoking... but alas, such a blog can only be developed over a great length of time. Time which I will use to study the art of blogging. Screw the sunshine - I need to blog. I need to eat, sleep and breath boob... I mean blog. Come with me friends as I embark on a fantastic journey of a young and still somewhat impressionable mind. This is the start of something special, something new, something so totally Shaundiggity.

      Those commercials are such crap.   First of all - it wasn't FREE... they would only cover $3.29 of the total cost - and guess what - that's not how much they retail for... cheap bastards...   Anyways - so it cost me $1.05 - which compaired to FREE - well it isn't FREE!   So I'm very excited to use it... I have this mark on my wall from when they hung the curtain rod... and I thought perfect test... it's a little black mark - no scratches or anything... so I start erasin'... hmmmm it's not going away... but wait - what's that... oh - that's the paint... disapearing... WONDERFUL.   Ok - maybe it's my fault... maybe I put too much elbow grease into it... those of you who have ever seen me&nbsp;or even just my elbow for that matter - would know that I have a lot of elbow grease... so maybe I don't know how to properly use the "magic" eraser... yeah right!   It's a POS - end of story!

      I'm nearly 24 - and thus far I think I've lived a pretty fun filled, exciting life - but is it possible that I've missed something(s)?  Woah - that's not the question - well not entirely. See a friend of my pointed out to me today that maybe I should have gone skinny dipping before now - which brings me to thinkin' - if that's true then what else might I have forgotten to do in my youth? (Not that I'm old by any means)&nbsp;  So here's the question: Is there a (set) list of things I should have accomplished in life by now?   Just a basic set...  starting with Skinny Dipping....

      So one of my friends made me a bet about an Elton John song - and in an effort to win she fudged the lyrics! I of course thought (only for a millisecond mind you) that they were the actual lyrics from the website (which btw I had just found and sent to her - I'm not thick - I'm just a little slow sometimes)... anyway - at the bottom of the lyrics there was an Updated By:... with the e-mail address of the person - so I e-mail the person (Kayleigh) and said "What's this noise?" Of course she was perplexed - what on Earth was I talking about I naturally had to apologize to for such wild accusations as incorrect EJ lyrics... and now we've sent a couple e-mails back and forth for a week or so.  Anyways she had one of these on her website - we've all seen these before - but this is a different one. Let's get to know Shaun!   First Name:  Shaun   Were you named after anyone?  Yes... I believe Jesus' middle name was Shaun   Do you wish on stars?  All the time... usually for sexual favors - haven't had  many  com true   Which finger is your favorite?

When did you last cry?  I last cried at my Nana's celebration of life   Do you like your handwriting?  Sometimes it can be good - sometimes it can be bad. At least it's not girly.   What is your favorite lunch meat?  Honeyed ham   Any bad habits?  Hmmmmm - maybe 1 or two   What is your most embarrassing CD on the shelf?  I don't own any embarrassing CDs - since the last robbery, I've only been buying hugh quality music!   If you were another person, would you be friends with YOU?  Yes... but only because I'd be trying to get my freak on with me... always good to have a hidden agenda with all of your friends cause you never know!   Are you a daredevil?  I'm getting better at this... still not ready to jump out of a plane yet - but I'm getting there.   Have you ever told a secret you swore not to tell?  No - I'm trustworthy.   Do looks matter?  Hell yeah!   Have you ever misused a word and it sounded absolutely stupid?  No - I'm good when I'm talking - spelling unfortunately is not my thang - so I often resort to using the wrong word because at least I know how to spell it!   Do you think there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?  Of course... and being of Irish heritage I know where they all are...   Do fish have feelings?  Until recently I didn't think they did - they of course are cold blooded... which lead me to believe that they couldn't "feel" the hook going through their lip - but I guess I was wrong or so I've been told.   Are you trendy?  Hmmmm maybe a little   How do you release anger?  Recently I've started talking to people about the "issue". I haven't gotten really mad for a long time - no crazy gf around ;) I work out a lot - so that probably helps me clear my head.   Where are you second homes?  Justin's house - maybe my dad's house can be considered a  true  second home. I'm also very welcome at Amn's house. I do spend a lot of time at my own house - maybe I need to get out more?   Do you trust others easily?  Hmmmmm - that's a tuffy... I am getting better at it. Giving people a better change to prove themselves worthy ;) I only trust a few people with everything...   What was your favorite toy as a child?  LEGO!   What class in school do you think is totally useless?  CAPP   Do you have a journal?  I guess this would be my journal.   Do you use sarcasm?  Errr me? - No! ;)   Have you ever been in a mosh pit?  Yes at the White Stripes... Amn and I lasted two crowd sways before backin' out of it.   What do you look for in a girl?  Still trying to work on this one - she must have a sense of humor, personality, someone who enjoys hangin' out... someone who is easy to be around - talk to... someone with ambition - someone who wants to go places... someone who is getting a higher education...   What are you nicknames?  See previous post:  urlLink Nicknames    Would you ever bungee jump?  Yes, but I'd rather jump out of a plane.   Do you untie your shoes when you take them off?  Yes... I have also been tryin' out the never untied shoelace on my skater shoes.   Do you think that you are strong?  Physically - I'm getting there / Emontionally - I'm getting better each and every day - one can never stop growing in this regard!   What is your least favorite food?  Onions and Peppers!   How many wisdom teeth do you have?  None - they all got taken out at once!   Are you in love with anyone?  Other than myself ;) :P Nope... still waiting to find that special someone.   How many people do you have a crush on right now?  A couple.   What do you miss most right now?  Cheesecake... and sex - the cheesecake thang will be taken care of this weekend... the sex on the other hand... might be left to the right hand...   What CD is in your CD player right now?  I made my friends a DMB / Dave Matthews solo mix... going to make a copy of it with a cool printed label for her and keep this one for myself.   What was the last thing you ate?  Froot Loops (2 bowls - I'm a big boy - I needs my energy)   Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  Sherry - she works downstairs in business licensing.   How are you today?  I'm great... took a muscle relaxant last night and used our  body   massage machine  on my neck... feelin' loose...   Hair colour?  Blonde.   Eye colour?  Blue.   Favorite month?  Any one of the summer months.   Last movie you watched?  Walkin' Tall   Favorite day of the year?  Probably my birthday - followed closely by Christmas.   Are you too shy to ask someone out?  I have been - but now I'm becoming more forward. I still have lots of practicing to do.   Relationships or one-night stands?  Two totally different ball games - each has special qualities. Right now - I'm not in the mood for a relationship - I'd have to really get to know her before that happened... and I guess I could always go for a one-night stand - I'll have to start " packin' " though...   Favorite board game?  Monopoly.   What did you watch on TV last night?  I didn't watch TV - I chatted on the internet - and did somebloggin' - then watched a movie...   Favorite smells?  Home cookin' & The scent of a woman.   What is the first thing you think of when you wake up in the morning?

      I must admit - she was more of a lady than I was a gentleman.  Granted I had been drinkin' and she was just high...  But I stopped to a much lower level of insult than she did.  I did end up learning something about myself - in that I now know more about the kind of girls I "don't like" than about the kind I do.  It's just that it is a lot of fun pickin' away at people - and at times it can be very humorous.   I only say things sometimes - in a effort to be funn (all in good fun - what are we doing if we can't laugh at ourselves  and others ?)  That's ok rite?  'Cause we're here for a good time... not a long time...  However - we're not going to get along with everyone all the time - and sometimes it's best if we just stay away from the people that rub us the wrong way.  I personally have a lot of good friends that I can learn so much from - about how to deal with being around people that you don't necessarily like being around.  On the other hand, I do find it very difficult being fake - and well, there are certain types of people with which I have   great   personality conflicts.  Well, I think it's pretty safe to say that I am still in the learning process when it comes to bein' a true gentleman... I am wanting to be more of a gentleman though - that's got to be a good sign - and it's not just to get the pussy!

      Trouble Don't you see That in your bed I find no sleep I confess you came because of me Trouble get behind me now Trouble let me be  Cold wet stone Deep river bed Once so clean and clear now runs red You know too well Was me that called you here Trouble get behind me now Trouble let me be  Oh sweet day Leave me behind I will never call on you Until the day I die Pray your mercy shine on me Pray your mercy shine  Here I stand Head bowed for thee My empty heart begs you Leave me be But I confess You know too well That I have fallen Pray your mercy give to me Pray your mercy shine Trouble thou And trouble thee Let your mercy shine  Cold wet stone River deep and red Your cold heart beats inside my head You know too well It was me that brought you here Ohhh trouble get behind me now Trouble let me be I pray your mercy shine on me Trouble let me be   -  Dave Matthews

      Allow me to explain... and I warn you I am completely candid in this post. Please -no one take offence to this - it's all in good fun. You know I love you all!   So it's Friday night.   Work's all done - ready for a big party weekend!   It's time for a good ol' BBQ at Salon's place. Salon has played host to a number of spectacular parties. This past new years being one of the best ever!   Anyways... I put on my sexyist pair of shorts and my tightest t-shirt ever... hopin' the ladies would want to feel me up.   Get to the partay - and get the drinkin' started!   Doesn't take too long for people to start with the "Shaun's cut off" comments ("")... which is a little worrying because I'd only had 1 beer at this point - thus begins my feelings of bein' unaccepted. Note - Shaun can be paranoid and drinkin' intensifies this affect.   See I was trying a whole new let's be chatty and sociable thang - didn't go over to well - I think it mostly scared people. Aparantly I'm loud.   There are times when people tell me to be louder - and now it's "be a little quieter". It would seem that I can find no happy medium. Of course - this is my fault - no real attempt to find this happy medium has been made whatsoever.   So I leave the party - had an offer to go down to the states and hang out with a friend. Seeing as how I felt I was being rejected by the partiers - a&nbsp;little too rowdy if you will. I figured it would be good to get away and see this friend for a while - we'd have some laughs - I wouldn't be so aggitative to others.   I go and gas up - head home - throw on some pants - get back on the road - and it turns out that was a bad idea. It wouldn't be fun with just me - no one wants just me - I'm not roudy enough ;)&nbsp; Which obviously doesn't make much sense seeing as how I (felt I) was being rejected for being too loud at the party (sorry just needed a little&nbsp;bitch bitch moan moan complain complain - and I'm done!)   So now I'm back at the party - people start to miss the sexy outfit I had on (boy that sounds a little gay) - I can't win - but meh, whatever. There are some new people - so I figure I'll mingle with them - why not they're cute young girls!! I love cute young girls.   So I get a little tipsy - end up in the&nbsp;washroom with two of them :P and this part will be sensored... just kidding. Nothing happened in the bathroom - well it got a little hot so I took off my shirt. I'm going to do that more often - I enjoy being topless - I also encourage others to feel the same way and follow suit.   Anyways people want to use the washroom for its purpose - we move our partay across the hall.   I should say that our partay consists of myself, Tiffy, Court and Greg. Good kids. Anyways Tiffy starts givin' Greggy a back rub... so I get down and request the pleasure of a back rub from Courtney. She gives a heck of a good back rub - fella's, she's got magic fingers!   So this is going so well, I decide to roll over (I learned that from my dog). Court and I then proceeded to make out - it was hott and it was heavy ;)&nbsp; I love kissin' - it's fun!   Greg and Tiff wouldn't leave the room - wanted to be there to WATCH out for their friend -&nbsp;of course. So I then invited Courtney to go find another place to "get fresh" - she agreed. *Grin*   So we head upstairs - oh look - a footon... choice&nbsp;excellent (this phrase borrowed from the ex Sarah)...   Now as you may be aware - I get quite sweaty - I believe that some of the medication I'm on makes me sweat - a lot! So I asked if it would be alright if I took off my clothing - everything except my boxers. I, of course was completely ok with this - Courtney is a sweet young girl - I would not take advantage of her.   Harmless, nearly naked makin' out - that's all that was going on.   What's this I hear - key's jingling outside the door - people want to come in. I am in my boxers - not that I would have minded people seeing me - all of me - but still - I wouldn't want them to think poorly of Courtney.   I go to the door and open it - there's Xuan-thy, Patrick, Justin and I believe Justin's older bro Jeff was there (quite mad). In my drunken stupor I managed to pick his room - hehe - whoops!   They also had a camera - got some good pics I hope - maybe they'll send me some so I can share with you all.   The photo taking was all quite flattering... in fact I encourage more photos of Shaun and Shaun Jr.   So I get dressed - head out to talk to them - Jeff is quite angry with me - I can understand him being upset - but I'd hoped that we could work this out&nbsp;- only a little&nbsp;misunderstanding. Nothing worthy of a beheading.   So -  everyone   agreed  it wouldn't be a good idea for me to try and talk to Jeff at this point. Needs some time to cool down - I'm perfectly ok with this.   However... dun dun dun... I can't understand why everyone - even my closest friends, think it would be best if I left. I sometimes get the feeling like people disown me quickly when even the smallest little thing happens. Shaun? Who's Shaun?&nbsp;(I invite people to offer their comments on this one - an open discussion) don't get me wrong - I'm not mad at anyone for this - I just don't understand it. Maybe it's just the beer affecting my perception of things - but I thought that people enjoyed my unusual drunken hi-jynx - gives people something to laugh about. Am I not a quirky - wacky friend? I'm not questioning my friends love for me - I just want to know if my friends&nbsp;have genuine concerns about how I act when I get drunk? If it bothers people - I'll stop.   So I say ok - I apologize to Justin for upsetting his brother. I didn't intend to cause this trouble. I send a special invitation to Justin and his brother to my BBQ next month - it'll be a good time - we can bury the hatchet - literally even - I have a big back yard - a little diggin' would be fun!   So I head out to my car -  sad  that I have to go... Courtney comes with me - we stand outside of my car - chatting for a while. It was fun - I enjoy chatting. Kissing and chatting (hmmmm sounds like the making of a good hobby if you ask me! - which I know you would)   Anyways - Courtney and I end up inside my car. More chatting - and after a little while - more kissing - YAY!   Obviously distrot without me - Geoff and others come out looking for me. Excellent sneaking up on the car. One time Chris even played an sexcellent decoy (dropped his trousers), diverting our attention while Xuan-thy snuck up with the camera... many more excellent photo's takin' (kinda like paparatzi - I felt so famous even dropped the few inhibitions I had about being  "watched"  - there was many a moon and even some testi. Poor Bob had naked man body rubbed all over her windows. Some of those guys had really greasy asses too - kinda troubleling. There was some nice scratches left on the hood of my car - thanks guys - that's super! It's ok - Bob needs a good detailin' - might get some use of the buffer I have in the garage. I'll need some cut polish - I think?   Anyways - it's now 3:30 am and the party comes to an end - thus ends another adventure! Well - at least I had fun - did you?&nbsp;   **********************************************************************************&nbsp;   Afterthoughts -  Shaundiggity :   I feel so great about being young and free - and heck I even kept my cool about the whole bedroom thing - I'm proud of myself. I am getting better - not so moody - might even say that I'm not as much of a head case anymore. My apologies are actually sincere - I will make an effort to not cause the same problem twice&nbsp;- you have to admit it's getting better - it's getting better all the time - Just like Zellers,   it's getting better and better!

      We're going to meet.   Fall in love instantly.   Get front row tickets to see U2.   She'll get invited up on stage with Bono during With or Without You (2nd encore).   When she get's back to my side she'll tell me "Baby, this just ain't going to work. I've had Bono for 4 minutes. How could I possibly go back to you?"   She'll then follow Bono around the world. She'll get to dance with him one more time before being halled off to a chinese jail for life - charged with stalking.

      It was about 6:22 on Monday - I was working.   I had been cleaning up the helpdesk schedule (a Word document).   Made it nice an pretty lots of colour - go to print it and there's like 9 jobs in the queue ahead of me - all belonging to C Smith (she's a web admin, she is also wheelchair bound) - and as I'm sure you know, colour laser printers aren't the fastest machines.   So using my technical know how - I go into the queue (I have administrative rights on all printers) - I set the priority of my job to 99 (the highest - the default is 1). So I watch the queue to see how it works (this is my first time - I'm very excited) - sure enough as soon as the current job is cleared from the queue my job gets sent to the printer.   I stroll up to the printer - who do I find there, C Smith - waiting for her billion print jobs to come out. She says to me - "oh this is going to a while" - I swear she said it with attitude too.   I watched a couple of pages come out - all hers... and then bam - my two pages come out... she grabs them - "Oh - what's this?" - she was so shocked... I said - "oh those are mine" Big smile on my face...&nbsp;the crippled bitch&nbsp;was baffled - I could tell she was thinkin' "how could this be - I sent a billion jobs - I saw them all in the queue".   I ran away with an evil laugh... muhahahahahahahahahahaha!    Ok - I didn't really do that  - but I thought about it... and it was definitely funny - I got a good chuckle out of it.

Stand By Me says:  cut down on replacement parts cost   ken says:  but what about all the local corpses that are disenfranchised because of cadaver outsourcing?   ken says:  numbers show that many of these corpses live below the poverty line!  the large majority are homeless and exist in filth!

      Some things in life are bad, They can really make you mad, Other things just make you swear and curse, When you're chewing life's gristle, Don't grumble, Give a whistle And this'll help things turn out for the best. And...  Always look on the bright side of life. [whistle] Always look on the light side of life. [whistle]  If life seems jolly rotten, There's something you've forgotten, And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing. When you're feeling in the dumps, Don't be silly chumps. Just purse your lips and whistle.  That's the thing. And...  Always look on the bright side of life. [whistle] Always look on the right side of life, [whistle]  For life is quite absurd And death's the final word. You must always face the curtain with a bow. Forget about your sin. Give the audience a grin. Enjoy it. It's your last chance, anyhow. So,...  Always look on the bright side of death, [whistle] Just before you draw your terminal breath. [whistle]  Life's a piece of shit, When you look at it. Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true. You'll see it's all a show. Keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is on you. And...  Always look on the bright side of life. Always look on the right side of life. [whistle]  Always look on the bright side of life! [whistle] Always look on the bright side of life!  [whistle] Always look on the bright side of life! [whistle] Always look on the bright side of life! [whistle] Always look on the bright side of life! [whistle] Always look on the bright side of life! [whistle] Always look on the bright side of life! [whistle] Always look on the bright side of life!

      The big weekend adventure - destination: Kelowna - purpose: Wakefest (check out all the girls!)  Night 1 - we (Justin, Brett (my Aussie cousin) and I) arrived in Kelowna shortly after 10:30 PM.  This night didn't go so well - we were grounded by Justin's grandpa. He didn't want us to wake up the neighborhood with the hum of the mighty Ford V8.  We ended up staying in the motorhome for the evening - got laughed at by Tracy via phone (we were supposed to meet up with her and her friends - always nice to make other laugh)... in the end we did manage to finish off the rest of grandpa's beer. (Justin did replenish the supply the next day - as to not be completely vengeful). We did have a pretty good time - shootin' the shit and what not... and this made us have more energy for the next day's festivities.  Got the day started pretty early - went into town for some breakfast - must point out the hashbrowns in Kelowna suck!  We managed to find the venue and start drinking at 2ish... they only had Coor's light - meh - it's sort of a beer... so we made do.  Boys let me tell ya - Kelowna has a lot of beautiful girls! They were everywhere... wearing next to nothing.  There was a bikini contest - I nearly placed... I mean - the girls were ummmm - tanned... well worth the price of admission.   We only managed to see a couple of wake boarding runs - which were cool - some nice jumps.  I have to learn to stop obsessing about things... I spent a lot of time text messaging - trying to find some friends - this really took away from the trip... when it came down to it - I, and I'm sure the crew did to, had more fun when I was just concentrating on having fun.  I got up to my usual drunken hi jynx... I don't remember it all... I do know that I seemed to master the art of maintaining a steady drunkenness -   let's see - I booted for some 15 year old girls (in an effort to be cool - and crazy... nothing more - ok ok - I did give them my card - they'll call me in 5 years... oh yeah I'm a thinker!)  Then there was the fence incident - I went around beach side to jump the fence to get into the beer garden - and well - only made it half way... it's ok ladies - don't worry - my mommy and daddy bits were not harmed... I do have a kick ass bruise to show off... I'll have to remove my shorts to show it to you... I knew you'd be cool with that ;)   Then during the concert - a young man was puking behind us - I let him know that wasn't a good idea (for about 10 minutes) - then I policed the area - didn't want anyone to sit in the puke...   Oh and I did get involved with the mosh pit - and sent some kids crowd surfing...  I think I got upset at the dude in the Japanese restaraunt for selling Ogopogo roles... let's face it - that's just wrong!  Then later on in the night slightly before getting trapped outside of the club I was seen screaming she's bicurious into the streets of downtown Kelowna - that I don't remember at all.  I like the fact that people have memories of the weekend that I don't... hopefully I helped people laugh - I know they helped me...  So even though the night ended early and I had a nice Shaun hissy fit... I look back on the adventure with a smile on my face...  I have to say special thanks to Justin for suggesting the trip and Brett for coming along - couldn't have had two better travel companions...  And of course - thank you to Grandpa Sundset for the use of the motorhome!

      Just a short dialog...  Uncle Frank "Your Aunt has been viewing her e-mails with the oldest ones on top - so I suggested we change that so the new ones are on top and the ones from last October are on the bottom. She thought this was a great idea. Viewing the oldest ones on top is stupid really."  Aunty Annette "Yes - and now he's broken it. I don't know what he's done to my e-mails. They seem to be all over the place. Now I can't find ANY of them."  Dad (Brian) "I think I saw one of your e-mails in my car port."

      So I'm driving in my car - listening to a CD (one I made) with Dire Straits - Brothers in Arms on it and 4 other Dire Straits songs...  As I'm listening to it on random I notice that even though it is playing randomly - the 4 extra songs are played together (just not in the same order)...  On a separate occasion I'm listening to my Get your Rock on CD (including such hits as It's Over Now (my new theme song) by Coverdale Page and Elegantly Wasted (me on Friday nights) by INXS... at any rate there are exactly 5 Aerosmith songs on the CD... again I listen to the CD on random - et voila - the 5 Aerosmith songs (scattered randomly on the CD) are played one after the other...  Freaky - I think so...

      ... but here it goes anyway...  Ok - earlier tonight I visited my local Esso station. This was my first visit in over three years. There was some pretty convincing anti-Esso propaganda on the poster boards at my school.  Anyway, I purchased $4.85 of gas as that was how much spare change I had. Moreover, the main reason I wanted to go to Esso was to redeem my Esso-extra points.  For every dollar you spend at Esso they give you 1 point. I'm sure many of the other points programs work like this... seems very standard.  The total count of my Esso extra points was a whopping 667 (4 of which were brand new - the other 663 were accumulated sometime in the 2000-2001 time frame). So what does 667 points get you - well I'll tell ya... those points got me 6 regular sized chocolate bars - each worth roughly a dollar... or 100 points a piece.   So I gave Esso $667 of my hard earned dollars - and they gave me a single penny back for each of those dollars. I guess when you think about it - it could have been worse... I could have been given nothing.  But wait -  I'm sure Esso (Exxon) is probably a multi-billion or even trillion dollar company - doesn't anyone think that they could have given me a little bit more back?  I can't help but feel as if they don't really value the business I gave them in 2000-2001. I just wish they could have been more appreciative.  In the end - I even threw away my last 67 points ($0.67) - maybe that was a bad idea - with the gas prices now - another half a tank would have given me enough for another chocolate bar.

      First and foremost I have to say thanks to Julie for having us out last night. The best hostess we have had in a really long time! Julie's the hostess with the mostess...  I think it's very safe to say everyone had a good time.  The evening ended a little sadly though - which is unfortunate.  I believe his name was brad - he made the mistake of waving his hands around and taking out a light bulb. All that was left was the aluminum screw bit - don't really know what happened to the rest of the bulb.  Anyway - I had been having pretty good luck at fixing things even though I was drunk - a real technical guru. My CD had fallen off the tray inside the player and was blocking the tray from closing. I took the mother apart and fixed it - right on - I rule!  So I thought I'd apply the same technical wizardry to the light fixture. Having done the same thing with many a Christmas light socket - I thought it would be a breeze. Surprisingly all the tools were quite easy to find in Julie's garage.  So I busted out the needle nose pliers - we were working away at this thing - I say we because there was 3 of us... Kyle, Justin and I... we were doing pretty good - getting the thing out in 1 mm pieces.   Now it's my turn again - only I'm slightly blind (need to eat more carrots) - so I start ripping away at the aluminum part of the socket - big mistake - see it all looked the same to me... now the thing is totally destroyed.  We (Justin) cut off the socket - and left the wires hanging there. In theory it should be really easy to fix.  All things aside - Julie, if it costs more than $34.10 to fix let me know.  Now all we have to do is hunt down big handed Brad...  Funeral services for the light socket will be held at PMSS - with the reception to follow at the Barney this Thursday...

      (Words spoken over the phone)  We have to talk.  There's something I have to tell you.  There's something I need you to understand.  Please listen to me.  Please.  Listen. If this relationship between you and I is going to work, I have to be number 1. I have to be the first person ok.  I want to be your number 1. Not number 2.  Listen.  I'm looking at you, are you looking at me?  Look at me. Look at me like I'm looking at you.  Look at me in my right eye.  Are you looking at me in my right eye?  No don't look at me in my left eye, look at me in my right eye.  Look.  I want to be your number 1.  You can call me 1 eye.  1 eye'd Pete.  No, Petie right eye, not left eye.  Fine, Petie 1 eye.  I want to be your number 1.  Listen.  What am I?  I'm glad we have an understanding.

      As some of you may know - I have been deathly ill these past few days. What started out as a sore neck quickly spiraled into an inner body infection. I say inner body infection - because - to be honest - I have lied to some of you as to where the infection actually was. Partly to hide my own embarrassment - partly to shield your fragile young minds.  I am happy to report - there is now only minor swelling and pain, and I can eat some solid foods again.  Also, my mind (which was the second most affected part of my body) is now fully back to functioning capacity - thus the blog posts should start to pour out of me in the very near future!  I don't have any spectacular adventures to report on from this passed weekend - I did go to theatre sports as a 3rd wheel (always a pleasure when it's with Amn and Heather - heck I could even be her other boyfriend) - we all went out for gelato after the show - I was a gelato virgin - it was damn good... then I went to the fireworks on Saturday - which was awesome - however, I'm sure the walking only worsened my condition... I then followed this up with sleep on Sunday - mixed up with cold sweats and feverish head rushes... thank goodness Monday was a holiday - I spent the day watching movies on PPV and calling Shaw to tell them it wasn't working - and getting some of them for free!  Now I am back on track - still walking a little funny - but I am sure I will be ready to get my tattoo done on Saturday.  I would like to thank all of you for sending me the lovely cards, flowers and balloons. It brightens up my day having them all over my room. :)  I should also mention - to all the ladies out there... oddly enough - the infection has had the most wondrous affect on my manhood - when I get excited it now swells to 14 times it's natural size!

      A moment of Silence for a Great Man.  With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person, which almost went unnoticed last week. Larry LaPrise, the man who wrote "The Hokey Pokey", died peacefully at age 93.  The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin. They put his left leg in, then the trouble started...  -  Author Unknown

      Ok... it's pretty clear that Shaun has no game.   I mean let's be honest here&nbsp;- the only gf's he's ever had - he's had only because they wanted him!   Well - lazy Shaun is just about dead - and crazy Shaun is starting to come into his own.   Starting to get the feel for the kind of girls he's interested in. Certain likes and dislikes, etc., but here's the hard part...&nbsp;how to get the ball rolling.   Remember - Shaun has no "game" (this is of course the technical hip term).   In his last effort to hit on the cute girls&nbsp;workin' at West 49 - he cleverly said "Hey! So where's the big party at tonight?" - mmmmmmmm hmmmmmm - yeah not a good line!   His cousin was supposed to give him some pointers - but he got too involved watchin' the body massage G.I.JOE cartoon "Who wants a body massage? It's the body massage machine. Body massage!" ... so now he must turn to you...   Some of you are cute young girls - so you must know what you like...&nbsp;and how you like to be approached for the first time.   After that... it's a matter of finding some young ladies who aren't all about "clubbin' and gettin' high" - a true rarity in this day and age...   Anyways - your suggestions would be most appreciated - I can't get by with just a toit body and cute smile forever!

      For one millions dollars... would you screw 52 sheep in the course of a year?  You could do it all at once, or one a week.  And the only ones that know about it, are you, the sheep and the farmer.
