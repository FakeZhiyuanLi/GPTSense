      So.... Now  Jessica Simpson  thinks that she's a BRITISH pop star? Her latest video/single is a cover of  Robbie Williams' "Angels."  I hate to tell her...but Robbie William's career is one hell of a lot diferent from Jessica's. Thus I feel that they should not cross paths in ANY sort of way. It's just plain scary.  On another scary note...has anyone seen the dude from  "The Scissor Sisters"  ?? I love their song out right now "Take Your Mama"...but this guy is REDICULOUS!!! Can anyone say  Freddy Mercury ? Not to mention..their logo is a pair of scissors w/ legs. It reminds me of the movie "ANNIE" where Carol Burnett (Mrs. Hannigan) tells Daddy Warbuck's assistant  "Isn't that right my little scissor's legs?" ...Love it. So yeah, check this dude out:  http://www.scissorsisters.com/upload_files/image/1077019618_NEW_PRESS_SHOT.jpg   Any comments?

      Yesterday I encountered a major problem ya'll.  I woke up w/ the song "Rudolph the red nosed raindeer" in my head.  But then...I COULDNT REMEMBER SOME OF THE RAINDEER'S NAMES!  I had Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Something, Cupid, Donner, And Blitzen.  So, I decided that the missing raindeer's name shall be "Snavely" And that he will be "Snavely the missing raindeer"....  So tell me,  have YOU seen any missing raindeer lately? If so, what is it's name. Is it possibly related to my dear Snavely?  He's awfully lonely.

      GEMINI  Drinking style Geminis can drink without changing their behavior much -- they're so naturally chatty and short-attention-spanned that it's just hard to tell sometimes. They can amaze you by conversing with finesse and allusion, then doing something to belie an extremely advanced state of intoxication, like puking in your shoe. Geminis possess the magic ability to flirt successfully (and uninfuriatingly, which is very tricky) with several people at once. They like to order different cocktails every round -- repetition is boring -- and may create a theme (like yellow drinks: beer, sauvignon blanc and limoncello) for their own amusement.  Trademark cocktails Easily bored Geminis need some stimulation in their drinks -- those with two parts, like a black and tan (or just a double), are particularly appealing. Otherwise, they'll drink all over the map, ordering frou-frou drinks to add to their collection of cocktail monkeys or going for whiskey rocks because they're feeling rather noir. Gemini rules the herb anise -- make some home-infused anise vodka as a gift.  Drinking buddies George Bush Sr., Johnny Depp, Rupert Everett, Boy George, Allen Ginsberg, Angelina Jolie, John Kennedy, Ian McKellen, Kylie Minogue, Morrissey    Do you think that's fitting for me? Is it lying? Tell me what you think. Also. Let me know what YOUR drinking style is by going here:   http://www.livejournal.com/users/princesskaite/80110.html

      I don't believe what I'm about to say...But, I love lawyers. The nicest two lawyers in the whole wide world came to my aide today when I had to appear in front of a judge to attempt to reverse the misdemeanor I had been given for not having a California driver's license. I won't get into how awful going to the DMV was. I passed the test and got my license is all that matters. Now...These two lawyers decided my case was stupid...didn't charge me anything...and completely got my sentence reversed. All I had to do was pay the cashier $10 bucks! These guys ruled. If ever you get arrested...Call THEM!

      Jeff Jeff... Your band was great last night. Some of us had our doubts though we were there to support you. But those doubts were shot to hell b/c you guys ROCKED! (So did that crazy girl doing the jig in the orange colored dress...but thats a whole different kind of "rock.")  So...question of the day: In the theme of Jeff and his songs...If you were to be "turned on and lit up" in chemistry class.  What Kind Of Element/Chemical/or Mineral Would you Be?   I'm gonna say I'd be  Mercury . Frustrating (when put into those puzzle games)...Easy shaken and broken apart, but always manages to pull it all back together in the end...Spaztic (when slid around it is hard to control and is always going just a bit too fast)Plus it has a shiny quality. I'd like to think I could be shiny too!

      VH-1 is still giving the love to their "Bands on the Run" heroes & Ft. Worth party goers, Flickerstick. They play the beginning guitar lick to "Beautiful" during the countdown show (VH-1 and a COUNTDOWN show? Gasp. Unheard of!!)"Hot Hollywood Couples." It's nice to know the Fort's still gettin' some lovin' even though the Flicker-My-Sticker bunch are currently unsigned after being dropped from their label and are "shopping" to release a second full length. Nice.  Here's a fun game. Make a joke using "Flickerstick" in the title. OR Give me an alternate name for them. I call them "Flicker my sticker" and I've heard "Flickermadoo-doo" the options are endless...C'mon...Take your best shot.

      This is a repost from my old lost journal that no one read....lets hope someone read this one today:  I would like to take this time to laugh at one of MTV's latest cencored songs. The song is Avril Lavigne's latest single. A song that actually PROMOTES girls keeping their virginity and not being "loose" aka: Britney Spears/Christina Aguilara. The songs chorus is even "did you think that I was going to give it up to you? Did you think that that was something I was gonna do?...I'm not the girl to throw it all away." etc. GOOD message. Good job Avril. And there's only one swear word. And I want to share it with you...so you can see the way MTV decided to "bleep" it.  Here's the line: "Don't think the fact your arm is now around my neck, will get you in my pants, I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget."  Ok..so you'd assume if ANYTHING was bleeped from there it would be "ass" but noooooo not MTV. they're so confused they bleeped it this way:  "Don't think the fact your arm is now around my neck, will get you in my *BLEEP*, I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget."  PANTS? PANTS? MTV has a problem w/ PANTS? you can talk about rape, say bitch every 5 seconds..watch the osbournes mouth the f'bomb every 2 seconds and see more of a womans body exposed in 1 minute than you would in a strip club! Yet, they have a problem with PANTS. I'm baffled. And the word PANTS used in a manner that actually promotes classy behavior.  Does anyone remember the song (from I believe either 1999 or 2000) called "Discovery Channel"...Man who was that by? The Bloodhound Gang. Thats who it was. Anyhow...in their song that was played time and time again uncensored on MTV. Anyhow..they had a line that said:  "Put your hands down my pants and I bet you'll feel nuts"  Which I have to say still gets stuck in my head to this very day. But thats condones, um...how do I say this. I despise the word fondling (yuck, I said it.)...so we'll go with "touching." Anyhow..it condones touching and they didn't bleep it with "put your hands down my *BLEEP*" I'm sorry for the rant. They keep playing that video on MTV and it keeps irking me.    ...I digress.

      The legend of the lady of white rock lake is well known. But what tends to varry is the actual nature of the girl's death. Some say that in the 50's she and her boyfriend were driving home on prom night and swerved to avoid hitting a dog and plunged into the lake. Another says that she and her boyfriend were out on the lake on prom night when she died in a boating accident. The one that I wrote this cheesy ass poem about was that it is the ghost of a young girl. (I can't remember now..but her last name was Davis) She left her family a note and drowned herself in the river. So...here's my litle poem.  THE LADY OF WHITE ROCK LAKE  On a Friday night in '35 The girl was likely still alive  But when Mrs. Davis found the note She felt a lump swell in her throat  A full moon hung over the sky Her girl had gone down to the lake to die  She waded out into the water Wishing she'd said goodbye to her father  Her face was as pale as the gown she wore When the police found her on the shore  Her body was limp but her soul they say Has been seen by many still this day  Looking for a ride just 5 miles home If you pick her up when you arrive she'll be gone  Just a puddle of water is left behind From a restless soul trapped frozen in time  urlLink     urlLink
