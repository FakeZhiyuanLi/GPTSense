      Cassi, I read your post. I know that we have also grown closer, 'specially lately. Wed. we should make a new tradition, but not tallcakes every week(that'd be good though)I know that we have grown closer in light of all that's happened lately. And it is great to have someone to talk to about things on my mind, and things that just *happen*  It's great to have someone that i can call up on a whim, and just hang out with, who loves to be as spontaneous as me, and even if you don't, Thanks for acting like it! And with all the Paul ordeals, i'm glad I can be there for you to talk to about it all. I'm also glad that you'll listen to me when i have things to say as well.  Thanks for being here for me Cassi, and I hope that you'll stick around for a while  I love you -tori

      Okay, so talking with some friends yesterday at a restaurant, we got to talking about how Bre has pretty much broken up with me, which, at least in my opinion, SUCKS! Bre and I had been Best friends all throughout 7th grade, and 8th grade, although, yes, we did grow apart in 9th-11th, I didn't ever think that we wouldn't/couldn't be friends anymore. And then it occurred to me, we can't be friends, because she's become friends with Slectues.   So that sounds HORRIBLE, we can't be friends because of her friend, but I think that's really true. So wow. yeh  While talking with my friends I had a sad sudden realization, that's two time that Slectues has made it so that people have "broken up" with me. :*(. and now I know why we can't get along...at all. The whole Matt ordeal I spose she REALLY didn't do, she just went along with. And I didn't and couldn't be mad at her for that. Which, I wasn't. I guess we were okay when they were going out too. BUT when Matt broke up with her, and was talking with me again, she was really mean to me. And I didn't do anything, just went along with it.(breaking up with Jodye doesn't count here, if you had talked to me at ALL about him the LAST MONTH of school, you knew that I thought we were having a hard time anyways).   So that's when I really starting being mean to her. (it's really hard to be nice to someone, that's mean to you - - I don't care what the Bible says about it- - it's REALLY hard) SO yeh. after a few months of this, I told Cassi, to tell Slectues that I wanted to be cool with her, to be friends with her, to stop all the crap that was going on. The next day Slectues came up to me we talked about it, smiled, and then hugged.   People still kept coming up to me though, thinking I would diss Slectues. They'd ask me a question, and I'd give them an answer, but that was all(contrary to belief). I think when people went up to Slectues though, and asked a question, she's answer it, and well...continue to diss me. So I decided it wasn't worth it, and I pretty much tried to erase her from my memory.   Then, Bre started hanging out with her. One day I got on to my expage, and there was a message in the guestbook, from who I knew was Bre. It was the beginning of the "break up." I tried to defend myself, as did she, but she wasn't the one under attack, so it made the whole situation REALLY weird.   SO yeh my best friend of at least two years, and a friend(at least) for 2 more...isn't my friend anymore. and it's really tearing me up. I've told Cassi and Cassi's mom about this, and it tore me up so much, that I couldn't even tell my mom, until about 2 weeks after it happened. So I told her, and now she's upset too. oh well. I'll get through it. I usually do.   So I'm fine except I have the worst thought going through my head now, that could ever go through. and that is :  "Is Slectues better than me now? This is the only reason I could possibly think that;-she's made two people break up with me, to be with her- or am I just really confused? or pissed, or sad, or sick to my stomach with the whole Bre thing STILL tearing at me...and maybe even a little of fear, and she could take another one of my closest's friends from me? Or do I really have more than her, that I don't have to take other people's things? can someone help me with this?!"  so, the worst thought, has come out, and well. I kind of hope she reads this...  -tori

      Okay...so checking out the whole Blog experience thing...i find the "spell check button!"...Ashley OBVIOUSLY hasn't found this button yet. Because well...she REALLY can't spell! so ashley...FIND IT!   Anyways. i think i'm ready for my first time...that is first time actually posting a real post type thingy. ya know.   So this is Friday. And I am Tori. and here is Cassi. and we are hanging out. okay...now that we have the scene, we can tell the story.   Well Matt was gonna do something with his friends, and Paul never really called Cassi, so we decided to have a date. With the delectable three layer chocolate cake, with chocolate mousse, with chocolate sauce, and caramel sauce, and vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, one big bowl, and two spoons, and two suicide lemonades calling our name...we headed to Ruby tuesday! :), and it was fun. ;) Lots of jokes came out of this evening. and well it's not OVERyet! hehe! so yeh, we got asked for our i.d.'s....we are SOOO NOT 21, I thought i was going crazy 'cause i saw a truck that Cassi DIDN'T see (Hi! This is Cassi, please understand that my view was blocked by a pillar...tori didn't realize this...quite humorous), and then this guy...who's actually QUITE creepy...came out of nowhere *yes there is a story about the creepiness, but it's not that good...so i just won't tell it! ;)* and then...there was this family...with the domineering mother..."LISTEN TO ME!" she says as she smacks the table...quite humorous again. and then the dad...boring. the little kid...boring. but then....there was the older kid...and the baby, and well. We thought the older kid was, well...retarded. cause he was trying to get the baby's attention, for something like a picture. So the baby's name was Hannah/Anna(not really sure!) and well the older kid was TOTALLY asking for WEENA!...i thought he was CrAzY. *he probably was!*   Then we decided...it was TIME TO GO! considering we were pretty sure the people around us were tired of us laughing, but considering it was the weirdo family(WEENA'S family*) i spose it was okay.   So we came to my house. and in the process of taking my sweatshirt off, the little plastic thing on the end of the string for the hoodie part decided it would GO UP MY NOSE! so obviously i ask it why "out of all the places you could go, why did you go up my nose!?" yet again Cass and i Laughed...and that was that. So now we are here...sitting, It's friday night. This is Tori, here is Cassi. and it's the same scene. Pretty exciting, but i'm sure that once i'm done with this...we'll end up laughing again. probably about how all the people that read this won't find it funny...really at all...but i spose you just had to be there. 'cause IT WAS!   Enjoy!   -tori

      YAY! i finally have this Blog thing...TOTALLY figured out...*well that's exaggerating a bit i spose*   So time for a not real post...again. Just to prove to myself that i really am as cool as i think i am! which...is OBVIOUSLY true. so here's Blog post #3!  -tori

      okay, so i know i JUST posted one...but that was sort of...a trial run i guess. I suppose i'll figure out this blog thing by just clicking on things...and hoping it does something..;)! so aynways. once i get this thing tamed, and under control i might actually have posts on here that are actually WORTH reading, but until then...you'll have to bear with me.   So Expage...it works. but not well...it has a limit as to how long a dang page can be :(. not good...at least not for talkative people like me :). So i'll keep that one...just 'cause people know about it. but i have a feeling that this will satisfy me WAY MORE! which is GREAT. umm yeh. so still working on it. until then...SORRY!  -tori

      Okay guys. Does anyone know what's been happening to me lately? It seems like I'm always...not me or something. For instance: I received my Miss Tullahoma personal sheet or whatever, and I  thought about answering every question as if I were a stuck up B*tch!? that's not me, and we all know that. So maybe i have schizophrenia, but that would totally suck! Partly because i'm supposed to write a personal statement... and well...I can't write it for one person, so how in the HELL am i gonna be able to write it for TWO?!  Speaking of personal statement. I'm supposed to find out who "i am" and then write about it, but well i don't think *I* really know "who I am" ...that's where EVERYONE else comes in. ok...so since my comments DON'T work...GRRR...STILL!!!! i spose you'll have to email me...and be honest folks...if you have to...call me a b*tch...'cause i spose that's one thing colleges MIGHT wanna know. so do your thang. and i'll do mine....or try to. and *Maybe* go to college one day! :) that'll be cool! ;)  -tori

      so, wow. i lied in the title for my last post. not much to say. in my last post i think i said A LOT more than i was meaning to.   but i did end up signing up for Miss Tullahoma, and "thing" talk all the damn smack you want. It's not really a big deal to me, never has been. So here is your invitation to "talk it up"  So yeh. Today Matthew and I and his mommy went up to Franklin together, we had a good time. and I FINALLY got to eat at Matt's fave restaurant. So now i'm sitting at home on a SATURDAY night, because...yet again i wasn't invited to do anything...if there was anything to be done.   -tori

      So i got accepted to the "Festival of Winds and Percussion" do-hickey-ma-bobber at Tech! VOOT! but that's about the only BIG news.  Things have been a little shaky in my life lately, but hopefully that'll be over now that term paper is turned it.  yeh. um. so i could like go into detail about that  last thing...but i won't.   I'm beginning to get "spring fever" ALREADY and it's not even MARCH! i can't wait to pull out the flip-flops and the shorts and tank tops. I look so much cooler in the spring. Unfortunately i'm not tanned...so i'll need to do that too.   So the big question of the evening, is whether i'm going to bring in $10 to school tomorrow for Miss Tullahoma. I haven't really gotten much positive feedback from the idea though, so i doubt i will. Cassi and Ashli have pretty much been the only two that haven't laughed in my face. Oh well. I guess laughter really tells you who your friends are...  -tori

      okay...my last post about prom was...well...crappy. So i took it off. well more or less just changed it. totally. I ended up gettin my dress, but i don't have shoes, and since i now think i'm annoying to hang around i don't think i want to ask someone to go with me...because no one will wanna. so yeah, um anyways. I'm going to prom. :) but i'm not near as excited as i think i should be.  So i figured out today that Emily doesn't plan on going, and well I also think i'm going to be practically forced into do an after prom thing, that hell, my boyfriend prolly won't even wanna come to. Hell I DON'T EVEN WANNA GO TO ONE IF I HAVE ONE> so i prolly won't have one. Sorry guys. I just don't wanna. I wanna be able to stay out, and not have the fear of being totally embarrassed by my mom (she's cool and all, but sometimes...) I don't wanna really get sloshed or anything, but i mean going to a party where everyone else is that i can laugh at would be really fun. BELIEVE ME. i won't get sloshed, or hammered (no connection with my nickname there btw), or wasted...or tipsy *i think that's the new phrase* or anything else like that.   Okay so my cat is freaking me out right now...(random fact)  anyways. so this is my first post in a while that hasn't sounded depressed, but in reality i sort of am. I mean i'm on Spring break and either EVERYONE is gone, or EVERYONE isn't calling me...prolly the latter. I've done some stuff with Cassi, but i'm pretty sure even she's gettin tired of me. :( sadness.   it also had to freaking get really cold for spring break...which ROYALLY sucks.   "oh My goodness" -tori

      i hate the personal statement, i hate how it's my grade...i hate it i hate it i hate it.... Today was awesome though aside from my lesson...grr...that sucked. but yeh i was really really happy today, and so was Matt so we i'm sure we gross as in projectile vomiting beyond reason! which I love!. hehe. anyways.   my point of view on something other than how wonderful my life has been, aside from the damn personal statement, is the fact that i've totally drifted from all of my friends except Cassi and Emily Emadian, and it's not MATT'S fault no matter what anyone says, because in the past month he and i have only seen each other outside school like....7 times. So no one can blame it on him. They just never ask me to do anything anymore, and well, whenever i say we can do something it's OBVIOUSLY a STUPID idea to them...'cause i guess i'm not COOL enough for my friends...maybe they REALLY aren't my friends. so yeh. they can decide  -cherrieluck

      this is for you.   Okay, no matter how all my other things on here sounded...they were in NO WAY supposed to make anyone feel that i thought matthew was being a bad boyfriend. because he is most definately NOT. he is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo wonderful i can't really explain how wonderful. and i think i would most definately pour out my feelings on here if i knew that matt was going to be the only one to read them...and i'm sure he's not, so i'm not going to, but he pretty mch already knows how I geel about him and all that. So there really isn't any point in doing it. (sorry if that doesn't make sense)  but i most definately LOVE matthew standridge, and most definately DON'T think he is a bad boyfriend!  -tori

      Okay so Summer has started!!!  So i went to SCMI this past week...let me tell you...it was amazing(well most parts, but i'm only gonna divulge the good stuff) I got to hang out with Russell, Andrew, Tanner, Shalea and Tony again so that was cool.  I ALSO met Lindsey Jo, and Jesse. So i've got tons of awesome friends.  I got to know Logan better, along with his friend William and Thomas. so it was AWESOME  anyways we played in the concert and i was fantastic. At least *I* thought i was.

      wow guys, yeah it's been a really long time since i last posted. But i'll tell you all the stuff that's been going on in my life. Okay so, um.   This summer I am SUPPOSED to go to Cali with Cass, but after i tried to let her know that i cared about her, and i really still wanted her to graduate in MY CLASS. or, we could still go to Cali, instead of her going to summer school. I believe she called me a Fucking Bitch, and she wants me to apologize to her. So i guess i'll be apologizing for caring. BUt anyways. If i don't apologize, i'm not going to California.   I've also got my church's mission trip to Chicago that i'm going on. It'll be fun...ish. I mean i'm not really the BEST of friends with anyone going...'cept ashli, and well. My views on homeless people are a little bit different than anyone else's and well that makes me a really hostile person. so yeh. I'm also the oldest kid going...so that's kind of weird. But whatever.   So i'm really not here all summer. like i'm also going to a music camp, and soccer camp. and soccer state. so yeah i figured out today that i'm gone for all but 18 days of this summer...and not but one of those times is longer than 4 days...so I'm sad.  Mainly because of Matthew. He graduates this year, and well. I won't have the ability to see him everyday next year once school starts back up. So I'm really sad about that, and that's partly because these past few weeks of school he hasn't kissed me but once, and when he dd he said oops, because he thinks i might have mono. So therefore we haven't really seen each other out of school at all...this weekend or last. But i guess that just makes ME THE LOSER.   so yeah. i'm anxious and eager about summer. Just like i'm anxious and eager about next school year...but that comes in a later post, because this one is already a BUTTLOAD LONG!  -tori

      Most Amazing thing that i have ever done. That would be mission work in CHicago. let's just say I LOVE CHICAGO!!! I know that if there is a big city i have to live in...that will be it.   I Love God so much now, because I was able to see him in ways that i would never be able to see before. I loved God already, but I don't believe that is was unconditionally and that it was really really gonna be long termish or anything. Now i know he's staying there...  NOt only did i grow stronger in my faith, but i was able to see God in Chicago, of all places. I was able to be one of the ways that God was working in such a large City.  I was also given the opportunity to become great friends with Ashli a.k.a Mooney (who was already a great friend) Lauren a.k.a Almond (who was a good friend, but now is a great friend) and Elizabeth a.k.a Lefty Loosey Long-Legs-Lane. My youth group also grew.   I LOVE CHICAGO!!!!!

      Okay...This I think will be my first REALLY meaningful post...And more than likely...The one person that I want to really read it won't.   Throughout high school I've had some really cool people take me under their wing, my freshman year I really had my sister, Raena, and her friends, Paige, Amanda, and Allison looking out for me. Obviously I also had Matthew watching out for me, and when Matthew wasn't there Cory always was.  Sophomore year rolled around...Naner, Paigey, Manda, and Ally were still there for me, but shit happened...And Matt was no longer there...Neither was Cory, because of certain other circumstances, but I made it through...I'd had to do it before. And I wasn't really that upset about the shittiness of it all...I was coping. So I moved on, hung out with Brian 'brybry' McCoy, we started dating...But things didn't work again. The Mr. Jodye Morgan and I were both kind of sulking at a new years party and met, and I realized...He was a cool, and very adorable kid. So Brian and I ended, and Jodye and I started. Jodye and I REALLY had a connection, but deep down everyone...Knew that I still loved Matt. Jodye and I (in my opinion were also growing apart, but considering I SUCK at breaking up with people...It took me  long time to break up with Jodye) So yeah...Anyways When I did finally break up with Jodye he, and all his friends...And everyone else, seemed to think that is was so I could go out with Matt again, but in fact...I didn't start going back out with Matt until the middle of July, because...Honestly...I WASN'T READY TO.  Anyways...So Matt and I were back together :). But Cory was having problems with Emily. Well I get this note from Cory saying he went and read all our old emails to each other and found one that said "I'll always be there for him" and that "he needed me now"...Well...I wasn't there when Cory needed me...And it really make me hurt NOW to realize that I totally let one of my best friends down...Way down.   (right now...I can't really remember WHY I started this post in the first place...But I'm just writing away and it's making me feel really a whole lot better, cause all things are not that great right now)  So now I feel really bad. Because I had realized that there are so so many relationships that I could have let evolve that I didn't throughout my first 3 years in high school. Cory, Cory Hamilton, being the main one.   I've tried calling Cory a couple times this summer, but he's working the night shift, so it's sort of difficult. I really really just want to sit down one day though, and just talk to him all day about all sorts of random things...My yellow shirt, my really good phone reception, recycling, Empty Chair, his work, his life, my life, relationships, and anything else that's EXTREMELY random that we can find to talk about...Because I'm missing Cory right now, and I can't find a real way to just tell him so hopefully he will read this. Cory once said in a post on his site titled "The luckiest guys I know" that "Tori, is probably the coolest girl I've ever met." well I know that Cory is definitely up there on my list...And right now I'm missing him...And I'm not really sure why. But I know I am.   So Cory if you read this...You are the "friend I miss most"  -pink
