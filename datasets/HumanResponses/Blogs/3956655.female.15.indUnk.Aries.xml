To start off i went to church and sat with becca after church i went to golden corral with the skinners.   I just invited becca and laura to spend the night tonight after church and go to the zoo tomorrow with us.   Reagan is at jonathan's house and everythings going smooth.   G'daddy is at our house to pick up his  disc thingy he put in our garage.   Dudley is sitting in the middle of the floor looking  sad and lonely.    The hillars  joined our church today so they're gonna come every week now.  Man i'm really thirsty.....   This morning trying to get ready for church fast i scraped my ankle on the tip of a hanger it still is aching.                                 Lol dudley just stole a vacume cleaner attachment .    This year i got to pick out my own ciriculim  for school sense the ciriculim i was using  (  alpha omega )  is retarded i picked out calvert school for home.  well i guess this is all i'm gonna write for now.
