      and i thought that the olympic games would make the calls go away ... unfortunately not .... :-(  today is the last day taking calls for the next 3 weeks .... i was not able to escape my fate of becoming a cable-tv tech support as well as internet tech, so they send me in formation ...  i just hope that Fannie gives the class :-)
