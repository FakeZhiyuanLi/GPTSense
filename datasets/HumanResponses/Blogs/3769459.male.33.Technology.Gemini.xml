      I've started to put together this 80's tribute. I have Allan Dover from "The Ozzbornzz" on vocals and have a few guitar players lined up. I'm still looking for a drummer for the project. I'll be setting up rehearsals soon. And have a target date of late July or August to play live.  Allan and I have started to audition guitar players and drummers...  IF you are are either a guitar player of drummer and you want to play some bitchin' tunes from the 80's send an email to "scotty_saturn@hotmail.com".

      On Thursday June 17th, Scratch had played an afternoon show @ Carrefour School in Rockland. Chris Evans is leaving  as a music teacher and going to a high school in Orleans to teach another music program. Chris had been a teacher there for 7 years and it was his way of saying goodbye to his students. The performance was a surprise to the students. When we went on, the kids were screaming so loud it was Beatles-like. We only played a coulpe of songs, but it was quite a rush. It was weird to talk to the kids afterwards and sign autographs.

      I and Alan have not worked too hard latley with getting Jett Black going like we had in June and July. I have made Jett Black my main focus right now.    Also I have officially left Scratch. It was a hard decision, as I started the band almost 10 years ago and hated how things were going. The main reason I had quit is because, several of the members did not want to play many shows. I felt that since we had spent alot of $$$ recording a 3 song demo, we best work it out with shows around Ottawa and the surrounding areas.  Anyways...Onward and upward from here...Ciao
