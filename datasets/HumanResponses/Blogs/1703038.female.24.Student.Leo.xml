      I had a conference with one of my professors the day after my jaw locked up for four hours and she caught me sniffling in the music building restroom while I read over my completely inked in with obligations day planner.  I leaned against a hair-defiled porcelain sink and nodded mutely as Dr. Symes, whose ruthless efficiency in diagnosing and belittling her students' emotional traumas is well known and feared throughout the music building, lectured me about relaxing.  She was surprisingly receptive as I recounted all the stress-related melodies I've had over the years:  TMJ from years of horn playing and gritting my teeth while I'm class; a screwed-up back from catering and lifting way heavy bowls and platters of food in and out of vans; and the ever-present headaches from just being a highstrung, hypochondriachal, basket case.  Her remedy:  Find a way to either get rid of some classes or tell my supervising professor to kiss his ass when he abuses my time and sanity.  I'm not supposed to run his personal errands, but that's kinda what I find myself doing in lieu of finishing assignments or, like, showering.  If that didn't work, she said, get out of town for a while.  Take a semester off.  I'm no good to them if I can't even handle my own personal life.  Her destress or go home orders weren't completely devoid of incentive for me.  My ed. professors have  intimated that their retirement or promotions to the upper echelons of music school admin. (heh) are imminent and that maybe they'd want someone young and fresh to take over when that time comes.  They're worried that the youngness and freshness might be already sucked dry by the time I attempt a doctoral degree Since retreating home to the Bushwhacker Capital of the World and licking my wounds in the comfort of my parent's home isn't an entirely plausible option, I'm destressing.  I threw away all the refined sugars, coffee, tea, pop, and fatty stuff out of my cabinets and refrigerator in a nutrition blitz that left Jay silently mourning his grandmother's ginger snaps while he gnawed on baby carrots for lunch.  I have planned every spare minute of my day with every form of holistic exercise available in my town:  Tai chi on Mondays and Fridays at the armory, lifting weights early on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, running on the nature trails on Tuesday and Thursday, and I even managed to multitask quality time with Jay by getting in a leisurely walk with him on either Saturday or Sunday.  I bought herbal teas and smoothie ingredients, yoga books and Pilates tapes, and I'm looking into a spa day sometime before the wedding.  The problem with all my super-zen activities is...they're freaking stressing me out!  Tai chi at the armory conflicts with my usual gym time and it only leaves me thirty minutes before class.  Since all my coffee is making groundwater (well, groundcoffee) at some landfill, I'm having massive caffeine withdrawal and I fell asleep in class today.  I love the yoga books (well, at least the inside dust jacket) but I don't have time to read them since I'm behind on my chapters for grad sem, and that spa day...I'm going to have to save for weeks and weeks just to afford a pedicure!  Jay and I don't even have the same schedule on weekends, so scheduling a day trip to a scenic walking path for this weekend ended in a battle of our planners and a half-hearted promise to work something in. Dr. Symes suggested an online course in stress management but I checked into it and it has assignments.  With grades and due dates.  For people who already can't handle the due dates and grades they have in their normal lives.  Good thinking, MU.  One good thing, as I armed myself to the hilt with relaxation therapy at the bookstore today, I popped Jeff Buckley's Live at Sin-E into my shopping bag.  Mmmm...I think he's my new Chet Baker.

      I ran 1/3 of a mile and fastwalked a 1/3 of a mile back before the rains hit.  I sorta wanted to barf when I got done but at least the shin splints and the seeing black didn't happen.  I guess not too bad for the first exercise break in two years of inactivity.  Still, not too good either in a general sense.  Oh well, baby steps to acceptable health levels.

      I am not an athlete.  When I get back to school and find a scanner to post some self-indulgent pictures, you'll see why.  Short legs, shorter arms and well....I'm a little bit fat.  Which totally doesn't bother me that much, because I'm designed to be soft and curvy and comfortable.  The Mexican dishwashers at the restaurant where I used to work called me "La chica suave", and I was secretly proud of it even if Mexicans are disconcertingly fond of pasty white girls.  What bothers me is that jogging across campus to get to class is a big deal to me.  Moving fast will ultimately end in a lot of sweat and my inability to gasp out more than a few words in between recovery breaths.  Just from jogging.  Across campus.  Ugh.  A couple of years ago, after my stint at the Very Bad College and the resultant string of loser boyfriends, binge eating, and depression induced indolence, my body grew from endearing plumpness to alarming obesity.  A guy friend of mine got drunk one night and asked if I was "busting the deuce" yet.  I didn't know what he meant until I did my ritual scale check the next morning and stared as the needle quivered well over two hundred pounds.  I wanted to barf.  I think I would have, but back then I would have considered that an unnecessary waste of good food.  Instead I joined a gym and started eating Subways every day, just like that Jared Fogle guy.  And it totally worked, except I didn't become a thin Jewish man so much as an average sized white girl again.  The curves were still there.  They just weren't so...um...profound.  The most important part was the gym.  I started moving and perspiring and hurting myself a lot.  The big surprise was that I loved it.  I used to stare at Headline News for hours while I puffed away on the elliptical trainers and the treadmills.  At one point I even started running, or at least lumbering for about at a minute at a time.  It was torturous, but after the pains in my chest subsided I felt a wonderful glow for the rest of my workout.  Soon, I started adding time to my "runs" and my near death experiences moved from the beginning of the workout to the end.  The day that I actually ran a whole mile without stopping, I had to grab onto the rails to keep myself from throwing up my fists in triumph.  I felt like Forrest Gump.  One day I was a beached whale on a treadmill, the next I WAS RUNNIIIIING.  That was two years ago.  Since then, relationship complacency and lack of fundage for a gym has tipped my scale a little closer to dumpy than I'd like.  With the wedding coming up, my need to reduce the size of my ass and get rid of at least one of my chins has reached a fever pitch.  This time, I just can't seem to get started.  Before I met Jay, it didn't matter that the 1,200 calories I ate every day came from the exact same meal plan, but I gave in and began cooking real food after he started tearing up every time I pulled out salad fixings.  Likewise with the exercise...graduate students who are stupid enough to take twenty hours of classes don't leave themselves much time for personal activities.    Still, I want desperately to run.  I bought two books, a brand new super comfy pair of Saucony shoes, and I not only made a running schedule, but I started a running blog as well.  That was three months ago, and I haven't used ANY of it.  I'm not sure if I'm subconsciously reacting to how much it hurt before, how weird I looked when I caught my reflection in gym mirrors, or how much it sucked to see real runners effortlessly run circles around me on the track while I was still limping through my first lap.  I keep looking outside to see if these prairie winds will subside so I can at least make a try at it today, but I'll most likely watch E! True Hollywood Storys and paint my toenails.  Anyway, the Great Ass Reduction of 2004 has commenced, and if I get inspired in the next few hours to run, I'll let you know.

      While most college students go to Daytona or wherever for spring break, I go to Nevemo and do my mother's bidding and chaffeur my adorable little brother to all his school stuff.  I'm not complaining...I think it's pretty fun and completely relaxing.  Anyway...the Internet service in my hometown is less than reliable, so no proctrated ramblings for at least a few more days.  In fact, I bet the connection'll time out before I finish this post. (Actually posting it is another story)   Anyway, be safe where you are and tune in next week...

      Oh joyousness!  The student center replaced the Chick Filet with a sushi bar.  Screw grading papers...I HAVE to go try this out.  I wonder if food court sushi is more or less suspect than, say, McDonald's lobster rolls or gas station Chinese food.  I don't care if I puke up my own organs; having on-demand sushi access is worth it.    I'm off to go investigate.  Details at eleven. (heh)

      I spent Monday night (and part of Tuesday night) in my converted practice room/office.  I hadn't pulled an all nighter in years, partly because Jay is a farm kid and gets seriously perturbed if anyone discusses the idea of going to bed later than eleven and waking up after six and partly because I just don't care enough about assignments to waste my sitting around time on them.  I got slammed, with my dad and the cat and the tire and my own students taking  their  test and freaking out about it, so I wore my ass print into our ratty, pumpkin colored desk chair from 8 pm until 6 am fiddling with music engraving files and reports about tunebooks and outlines for my lecture tonight and...and it was lonely and horrible and at about three o'clock my jaw locked closed because I had been furiously clenching it for hours while I engraved music our windowless hole of office efficiency.  In the morning I went home, showered, snapped at Jay for not taking out the tower of trash and went back to work. Welcome to Grownupville, right?  Yeah...I know.  And I'm really not complaining, except during the whole day that I was bleary eyed and shivering  from the cold that always seems to partner up with fatigue and settle in the base of my spine, absolutely no one asked how I was.  It's not like I wanted the school to post  a memorial statue to me for putting off my assignments and doing them overnight, but it was pretty obvious by my four gas station coffee cups and the fortress of books I had built around the computer chair that something was up.  But...nothing.  Tayte and Marcus were just annoyed that they couldn't check their e-mail or post grades because I was still scrambling to write percussion parts ten minutes before class started.  Laira had a recital that day and brought in her fancy skirts for me to match an outfit, never noticing that I had lost my voice and kept dropping the pencil I was using to help her make her to-do list.  No one in my grad. survey saw the wan girl with black crescent moons under her eyes stop and squint through her double vision as she presented her project, but my professor did have time to take me aside and ask if I wouldn't mind penning a student letter to the editor about our school's recent legal battles and "could I get that done by tomorrow because a lot of people are counting on you to do this?"  That's the story of my life:  Capable at school but a wreck at home.  Interesting enough to be good at mindless chitchat, but maybe not interesting enough to warrant a conversation about what I really think or what's really happening in my world.  Maybe it's my fault for not trying.  I'm terrified of so many things right now:  money, my thesis, dealing with my dad's sudden, secret depression, my competition, the wedding, getting a job, that I'm afraid if someone really DID ask me how I was I'd just dissolve into the floor from the relief of admitting it.   Recently I've begun to think that if I become any more unremarkable, I might just vanish altogether like I did before I left the Very Bad School, pinned into a corner by the weight of other people's problems and the stuff that I'm going crazy trying to hide in my own world.  Scrambling like hell to maintain a facade of normalcy is hard enough, but letting my guard down and realizing no one really gives a shit what I'm thinking is worse.  That's why blogging, even in light of the privacy issues and the potential embarrassment, is still so seductive and why I logged in to Blogger every day to write and erase the writing even when I was waiting for months for my site to "cool off" and be forgotten.  When I spill out all this stuff (petty and melodramatic as it may seem to you) it proves to me that I'm still here.  I start to remember me before I became Jay's fiance or MJB's assistant.  Before I moved to the education side of music and became a joke for all my old friends in the Back East conservatories.  When I had a voice and a mind that wasn't full of politeness and educational jargon and minced words for all the stupid, political games we play at the university.  And even if those who visit my blog are only feeling polite or obligated, the fact that someone out there reads and actually responds to what I'm saying means more than twenty offices full of sympathetic grad students.  It proves that the person I used to like still exists and is worth finding again.

      I wrote a long and probably painfully boring entry about how I'm appalled that Westerners don't educate their children to be casual musicians for fun, but I pressed something other than publish and it vanished.  I think Blogger knows I'm out of writing practice--except for the piles and piles of presentations I write on learning styles--and it didn't want to subject you to the shit I just wrote.  That's nice of Blogger.  Thank it if you drop by.  I'm not guaranteeing that the post won't resurrect itself, though.

           Shit has been raining down upon Jay and me for the past few months...just really random, crappy stuff that normal people can handle and put behind them but we--poor, starving, maligned college students that we are--just seem to add to a stack of insurmountable burdens we keep putting off and off and off...       Jay had a series of unplanned financial obligations that just seemed to string along for months...busted tire: fixed, shady landlord: negotiated; hit and run to his poor car: totaled, but the parents are keeping the money to fix THEIR car.  The parents, who claim to fund Jay through college, also won't pay him back for some medical bills that they ignored and went to collections.  All told, Jay has bounced seven checks, been collected on once, and got a notice from the prosecuting attorney's office for a bad check to McDonald's (oh, the embarrassment) because he never saw a penny of his insurance money.   It never ends, and his bank, a mega-institution dependent upon their buildings of computers rather than common sense and human emotion, are powerless to stop the overdraft fees from piling up day after day.      This weekend started with the same amount of bullshit with which every weekend commences: car trouble and fighting.  It was my car this time--the same busted wheel that we hadn't had time or money to fix for the past four days--and the fighting was over the same tired stuff about how I don't trust his parents and he's offended.  While we were fixing the car, his jack broke and the car almost fell on his leg.  I held the lug nuts and shivered through the first truly March temperatures we've had all month. The Texaco regulars were all lined up against the wall by the payphones, slitted eyes staring through their blue Marlboro smoke as they assessed whether or not we were unlucky, or just incompetent.  Finally, we put on a spare.  I shoved past the smokers, and  called my mom and dad to get the proffered credit card numbers for the tires, and my mom answered with a low, stuffy sounding voice.    "Where's Dad?" I asked, assuming they were still sleeping off their 26-hour bus ride back from the Happiest Place on Earth.  "He can't come to the phone.  They're with Frances."  This was normal; our venerable relic of a cat still had the power to use all of her claws to convince whoever her lap human was at the time to stay put until she was ready to get up. My dad was her favorite lap.  "Can't you bring the phone to him?  This is important." "They're at the vet with Frances.  She has to be put down, and I'm really sorry."    The thing was, my mom really  was  sorry.  Frances transcended the normal pet role in our family for a variety of different reasons.  She and my dad used to have conversations back and forth while she watched TV with him on his days off work.  She used to sleep with her butt on my face at night and only leave whenever she knew I was all the way asleep.  Frances was everyone's best friend, and she ended her life suffocating to death on her favorite chair while everyone else was out of town.  My dad said her joints had already stiffened when they found her.  I came to Jay with red eyes and the hiccups--a sure sign I was about to lose it.  He bundled me in his car, and I spent the rest of the afternoon on my couch watching the sky turn overcast and the freezing rain fall on the plants I had bought for the balcony in a fit of springtime hopefulness.  When I finally got up, four hours later, I found an e-mail from my Dad.   He's managed to connect the symptoms from Frances' death with his dad's;  they both had a form of emphysema and basically asphyxiated to death.  He told me he feels like a murderer for putting her down, which is normal except he thinks he murdered his dad and my little brother, too.  I didn't know he was the one to turn off life support for my grandpa and Alex, and I don't know if my family knows either, but I guess my dad can't stop blaming himself for all this death.  I used to joke that the only time I ever saw my dad cry was when we buried an animal, but it's obviously more than  that.  He begged me not to tell anyone else.  No one is close to my dad like me, but knowing that he thinks he killed our family is too much for one person to know.  I can't breathe I'm so worried for him, but what's a poor, starving, maligned college student supposed to do when her dad's three hours away and a mountain of bills, professors, and broken vehicles is determined to keep them apart?  I guess what I want to know is when is this shit going to stop, and how am I going to make it until then?

      I can't believe I'm typing this.       I busted my right front tire while driving home from class today.  For the record, I'm claiming it's from one of the countless potholes that spring up, lurk around corners, and give birth to baby potholes during the night after the snowplows peform their annual exfoliation of city streets,, but really it's because I was trying to read some assigned chapters for my graduate seminar tonight while I was driving.  I heard the BLAMCAJUNKCAJUNK that I've grown accustomed to since I began honing my shitty, tire bursting driving habits and pulled over at a gas station to assess the damage.  I was bent over in front of my wheel, simultaneously inspecting the tire for salvageability and shielding the general public from an intimate view of my ass crack when a brown paper bag wafted, American Beauty-style, down to the gravel in front of my feet.         I looked up--and up--at a behemoth, Saudi Arabia-old field-subsidizing SUV and its diminutive driver sloppily pouring a bottle of something grain alcohol related into a Sprite bottle.  Her hands were shaking so badly I saw the alcohol splash out of the bottle and onto her Casual Corner-issue fur lined jacket.  I caught her eye, and she stared at me through the smoked glass as she chugged the first third of her booze.  Her waay too trendy clothes and hairstyle screamed, "I'm forty.  I swear it!", but the dark spots on her hands put her at fifty, maybe more.  They looked even more burdened the enormous diamond rings slipping off her vodka splashed fingers. Her  eyes, carefully ringed in kohl and silver eyeshadow, were ancient and miserable.  Society wife gone wild.        She peeled away and nearly caught the same curb I did on her way out of the parking lot.   As I waited for Jay to come rescue me, I threw around the idea of calling her in for the police.  She had out of state vanity tags, so IDing the car wouldn't be any problem, but oh my God what if I ruined her life?  She could've been anyone...a CEO, a mother, a minister....what if she got all Law and Order-esque and killed herself after she got a DUI?  What if I saved her life?  What if I saved someone else's (my) life?  I know a lot of drunks; my grandpa, my old neighbors at the homeless shelter, but those guys were cariacutures of drunks--pink faced old guys with Old Fart trucker hats who would give me gum and quarters before that last six-pack of Schlitz kicked in and they passed out, or the guys who would puke in my lawn and night and clean it up before I left for work the next morning.  Alcoholism was funny--a story for the next day-- but this lady...  I called the cops on her, but the dispatcher seemed bored with it all and in the end I felt horrible.  My parents are chaperoning my brother's high school band's semi-annual pilgrimage to Walt Disney World, so when I called them about the tire they had to shout over some Epcot-related calliope music and they didn't understand what I was saying.  I think my dad thought I made a citizens' arrest and he said that was stupid.  My mom pushed her credit card on me for the tire and begged me to come home and attend sure-to-be-scandalous wedding in Neveda this weekend.  I left them to the Laser and Light Spectacular and sat moping at my computer about being broke and idealistic and misguided and and and...  Anyway, I think I'm blogging again.  (yay!)

      My little brother and I slouched in our Ikea-trendy chairs at  urlLink Coldstone Creamery  and dug into our waffle cone creations.  Mine, a Sinless Sweet Cream with strawberries and whipped cream.  His, an imposing concoction of fudge brownie, gummie bears, and Kit Kat.  Consumed by our dairy binge, we talked only to comment on the ice cream or offer one-line bits of gossip about friends and family.  "Get this," Adam mumbled through chunks of brownie,"Mom totally told me you're the way more talented and smart one but you had no motivation in school which is why I"m going to Princeton and you're here in Missouri."   I bit my lip so hard when I pulled my spoon out of my mouth, I wasn't sure if I was looking at a strawberry or blood.   "Shut up, dude.  She wouldn't say something like that."  But Adam was insistent that she had, and I wasn't sure who on whose behalf I was supposed to be more indignant:  His, because he's completely brilliant AND a hard worker so he deserves everything he gets, or me because I'm not a complete slacker.  I've done things...I swear.  Still, the thought bothered me the whole rest of the weekend as I raced around the house, performing two days worth of house cleaning in three hours so I could entertain the onslaught of in-laws coming in for Jay's junior recital.  God, it was such a navel gazing train of thought, but I finally decided I was unmotivated.  I DO suck because I'm lazy.   Do you know how depressing this is?  I didn't fail my senior recital because my horn broke.  I failed it because I realized I wasn't getting out of Missouri, so what was the point in doing well?  I sabotaged my only fucking ticket out of mediocrity because I didn't want to have to face the scariness of dealing with grad school, or a new city, or new people.  What I've written off as epic bad luck throughout my life may have just been self-abnegation in action. What a depressing thought...  So now I'm waiting for this epiphany on how to be industrious and motivated.  Dowdy, fifty year old housewives have epiphanies all the time.  I see them on that Bible channel giving all the credit to God for helping them divorce their husbands or lose 25 pounds.  What's he waiting for with me?    I can't even write a good post.  I hate this.

      I am having the worst writer's block, partly because the two things I want to write about--Jay and this education thing that's happening in Columbia--start out as nice little examples of expository blogging but unravel into trite metaphors and circular logic so I stick them in my drafts folder, and also partly because of some unexpected IP addresses in my blog registry.  It makes me self-conscious, I guess.  I'll suck it up, though, and try to start my foray into this whole West Blvd. business tomorrow.  I know, bite back the anticipation...  I'll leave you with this, future educators and music ed. friends: we wonder why teachers are considered lame, ill-informed, and poorly trained?  Here's why:  While U.S. Secretary of Education  urlLink Rod Paige was in Columbia  for a seminar specifically designed to explain and try to defend the merits of No Child Left Behind, what were we--future educators and future subjects of this ricockulous initiative--doing?  Oh yeah, we were in a classroom watching a PowerPoint slide about NCLB at the exact same time.  How the fuck are we supposed to be advocates and activists for the integrity of the teaching profession when we aren't able to even meet our Biggest Boss Ever and grill the hell out of him about this?  Because the morons in our teacher prep classes couldn't pull their structure-addled heads out of their fat, chalk-streaked asses long enough to realize that it's OKAY to deviate from a lesson plan if it means your students will LEARN MORE.  I'm fucking ashamed to be a future teacher sometimes.

      As a general rule, I do not like shit.    I should clarify:  I love  joking  about it, and much of my inner monologue is peppered with variations on the word, but as an actual physical entity, I absolutely hate poop.  Imagine my chagrin, then, when I walked into the womens' faculty washroom last week and found three GIANT turds floating in the toilet.  Not resting, or lurking in the the little toilet grotto at the back of the bowl, but floating just as proud as can be...so high in the water I expected them to stand up and salute.  I quickly backed out of the stall area and spent thirty seconds dry heaving into the sink.  I reeeally had to pee, though, so I did the Desperate Girl Bathroom User maneuver of closing my eyes, sticking my leg out, and kicking in the general direction of the flusher handle until the poop retreated into its murky home.  Still, I had to hover  because I was so afraid the turds would come back.  Later on in the week, I returned to the same washroom and found MORE poop; this time in chai tea-diarrhea form and accompanied by the most breathtaking stench imaginable.  All I could think of as I did the same gagging foot-flush move was... this is coming from a WOMAN.    Again, the very next day.  More crap, but it had actually migrated up onto the toilet lid, where it literally coated the entire surface in a mocha-colored poop paint.  I think Doug from Trading Spaces would have been impressed at the texturing.  Obviously, I didn't use the toilet that time and ended up doing the peepie dance down the block to the next available public restroom.    I've started visiting the washroom more out of curiosity than a need to urinate, because the horrors I've witnessed will forever preclude my going in that stall again.  Yesterday, I was not disappointed:  the crapper has now managed to get her poop ON THE WALL.  Similar to the blood streaks in the  Psycho  shower scene, there are chocolate covered splotches and drips running the length of the wall above the toilet.    My question is:  who is this impressive pooper, and should I get her some medical attention?

      I have to fucking go to court for absolutely nothing.  TO COURT.  FOR NOTHING.  I keep ruminating over this and my heart starts itching because I get so mad...  Well, not really nothing.  See, I was driving towards 63 on Broadway by the hospitals (you mid-Mo types know the place) and someone upfront of our rush-hour slug of traffic decides at the last minute they want to go to the hospital on the left instead of the right.  Slamming brakes and lane changes ensue.  The Camaro in front of me screeched to a halt and tried to pull out in the other lane to avoid wrecking, but apparently my brakes are no match for the  massive increase in gravity that a 15-degree downward slope will cause, and I slid right into her rear bumper.  I lamented loudly in Greek chorus fashion and we pulled off to the side of the road.  I watched the back of Red Camaro's head shaking violently as she whipped out her cellphone and dialed a few numbers.  Shit...she looked pissed.   When we got out, though, she was extremely concerned about my well being, which made me wonder if it was a little bit her fault.  We called the police, who were already, magically, cognizant of the accident and who promised to meet us posthaste.     Thirty minutes later, we had run about things to talk about as the stuff she knows (highlightin hair and REEEALLY needing to get back to the Kappa house for chapter meeting) and the stuff I know (being a musician and REAAALLY needing to get to Jeff City to teach my lessons and make my sixty bucks) didn't exactly intersect.  Finally, one of the Community Service Aide cars (we didn't even get first tier service after our ass-long wait) blocked traffic and a hulking butch lady in the style of that one character on Girl, Interrupted who was committed for beign gay got out of the "squad car".  Here is what transpired:  Butch Cop:  "Ma'am (I'm ma'am) I'll need your driver's license, proof of insurance, and your version of what happened:  Me:  Fumbling with papers and dropping pin.  "Shit...sorry.  Uh, what I can remember involved someone turning left at the last minute, everyone slamming on their brakes and trying to avoid each other.  I was the last person in the mess and I just couldn't avoid hitting her.  I tried to swerve...I braked in time....it just didn't happen".  Sorority Girl: "I totally don't think she could have avoided hitting me.  No one could.  I think it was no-fault".  Butch cop:  "Unfortunately we don't have a no-fault rule here in Missouri.  Sorority girl, your license is expired, but feel free to go on your way in your Camaro with no repercussions. You, ma'am will need to show up in court for your hearing regarding obscure city ordinance 1-416".    Me: "Uh...don't you want to take an accident report or look at damage or anything?"    Her:  "I'll do it later.  I have a good memory."  So, seriously.  Butch Cop didn't even look to see what the damage was. (Camaro Girl's:  nothing except two paint scratches.  Me:  total annihilation of the front bumper.  I hate my car.)  And I have this ticket, whose ordinance refers to the following:  "Failure to take measures to avoid a collision".  WTF?  Do they think I just put my hands up, flipped off my insurance company, rolled down the hill and yelled, "Woooooo!" the whole way?  Utter bullshit, man.    So anyway.  I have this court date.  The fine can be anywhere from a dollar to a thousand dollars, quoth Butch Cop.  Can you do time served on traffic violations?  It might be fun...    Anyway, check out  urlLink the link  I added under Piss Off Your Boss.   Extremely funny and perfect for people like me who pretend they're New Yorkers in their heads when they're really looking for garbanzo beans in a Super Wal-Mart.

      Part of my Gal Friday job with my supervising professor (who will henceforth be known as The Badger because a)he resembles a badger and b)it's way more fun and easier to write than my supervising professor) is to make sure that human concerns get addressed between him and the students.  For example, when The Badger came to me in a snit because one student's baby's due date conflicted with our final exam, it was my job to talk to her and find out if her boyfriend/husband/whoever could proctor the exam for her while she was on bedrest, etc.  What I wasn't planning to find out was that she had been raped, too afraid and scared of AIDS to see a doctor, and that her monthly home pregnancy tests never indicated she was actually pregnant until she was six months along.  There was no one to proctor the test and there was no one to help her give birth to this stranger's baby.  Instead of a scheduling accommodation, I had a completely terrible, heartwrenching, and utterly human story to report back to The Badger.  At a certain point in the semester, usually when the weather is turning unmistakably arctic in the fall or when leaf is subsiding to leaf in the spring, and we're transitioning from our experimental jazz unit into the background of rock 'n roll, I stare at the 250 blank faces in the auditorium and start wondering about their lives instead of hating them for sleeping through yet another Ella Fitzgerald song.   I also panic, wondering if I've helped their grades or their grasp of a hundred years of music they've never heard before.  I agonize over every e-mail...every conversation, because I want to make sure they're all taken care of.  Even the frat guys.  Even though they don't know it, and they're all only five years younger than me at most, and they probably hate me because I'm just The Badger's flunkie, I think of them as my kids.  I've told them more than once that I'll do anything legal to help them pass the class: wake-up calls, rides to school, extra study sessions...anything.  I'm not bragging, I don't think, because I really care about all of them.  I really do.  I've been worried about one girl in particular.  Amber introduced herself to me the first day of class because she noticed I had a Nevamo t-shirt on.  She showed me her Eldo jacket and bubbled, "We're neighbors!"    We were, indeed.  Eldo's a quick twenty minutes away from my hometown.  We both decided it was refreshing to meet someone not from St. Louis or Kansas City, and we settled down in a comfortably restrained TA/student casual friendship.  I took notes for her if her kid was sick, and she wrote me reasonably chatty e-mails as a way of thanks.    As I stared at my kids from the front of the auditorium today, I noticed Amber's face was peculiarly red, like she'd dashed across campus or she had some bad allergies or something.  She came up to me after class, gaze trained intently on the stained carpet below our feet.  "Tyson's father and I aren't doing too well and we fought last night so I missed the review session.  Can I make it up?"  Of course she could, and after we made plans, she finally raised her eyes to mine as she  left the auditorium smiling.  I almost vomited when I noticed she grimaced every time she grinned and that the redness wasn't from being flushed. It was from being hit.  On the face.  I'm e-mailing her now to set up a time to meet and go over some music stuff, but my fingers are itching to tell her I'll help her.  I'll do anything.  But how weird is it to say "Dont' forget to read those articles on Chuck Berry and by the way, Stranger, if your husband's beating you like I think he is and you need a place to shelter yourself and your child I've never met, please feel free to use my air mattress at any time?"  Is it weird that I would even consider offering that?    The other thing is that Jay and I are poor.  Like REEEALLY po'.  We need mo' money.  It's ridiculous that I even have Internet at home because we're student charging Ramen noodles and gallons of milk at the campus convenience store.  If I offered my place to Amber, I couldnt' give her food or extra stuff like that.  How could I give her a place to stay if she doesn't have money to feed her baby or get herself anything to eat?  Ungh...it's too much to think about.  I can't decide whether to keep this e-mail within the confines of the class or extend something...anything to her to let her know that I'm aware of how hard it is to maintain a life and be a student at the same time.   It's a sad situation for Amber and Tyson (and maybe even the father, whoever he is).  But like I said, it's also a terribly human situation, and humanity is part of my job description.

      From my previous posts, it's probably obvious to you that I'm somewhat of a music dork.  A band geek.  An orchestra fag.  Whatever.  I used to play the horn.  Pretty well, and for a while I considered A Big Conservatory Back East for my grad. school plans.  Then, Jay came into my life and I ran out of money and soon my thoughts of Big Conservatories Back East turned into Big Schools in Colorado or Maybe Alabama which eventually ended up being Big School in the Same Place I Already Was.    So, here I am, and according to Mizzou, being a music ed. major is mutually exclusive to being a good musician, which is unfortunate but also the subject of a different post altogether.  The more I tried to fight against that stereotype, the more I fell victim to it.  Writing papers time started infringing upon practice time and my horn became just another object in my bedroom good for hanging lingerie out to dry.  The whole situation was disappointing not so much because I used to be good--maybe even really good--and now I'm really out of shape, but because putting aside the horn meant giving up on something I considered a great love in my life.  Maybe, secretly, even more of a love than I felt for Jay at one point.  It's difficult--and kind of dorky--to explain a love affair with twelve feet of metal and tubing, but there's definitely a particular kind of ecstacy that comes with getting everything just right...training your mouth and fingers to move precisely and intricately at the exact same time...it's almost sexual, but not.  I've heard it called "making special", because it takes a special kind of person to create music.   When I gave up the horn, I sorta lost what made me special.  I lost my mojo if you want to call it that.  Another thing that made my new career choice so bitter were two sophomore horn players named Andrea and Stuart a.k.a. Satan's Minions if you're a student here.  Stuart's a hipster in the defiant way that some people are racist; his rumpled clothes are always perfectly coordinated with a tragic hairstyle and a five o'clock shadow to let everyone in class know he overslept again because he was up late organizing his vinyl collection.  I think Andrea wears enough  urlLink Hot Topic  fake fur and polyester to warrant her own fire hazard warning and although dangerously thin, she still manages to find vintage pants tight enough to create backfat on her anorexic frame.   But that's not why they're evil...it's just fun to talk about.  They're horrible, horrible people because when the announcement that I got the history TA position for this year was released, they made sure to also announce that I was pathetic and a failure for not leaving.  When I performed in competitions or recitals, they sat on the front row and kept a tally of every missed note.  If I practiced two hours, they would stay for three.  If I learned a new piece, they'd have it the next week.  Eventually, the bitchiness just wasn't worth it; for the sake of my own sanity, I just gave up and let them win.   I ended up fulfilling that ed major prophecy: 'those who can't, teach."  I stopped practicing, and after a while, I couldn't play a note.  At all.  I had lost it--whatever "it" is.   I hadn't seen the Minions for at least six months, but they gave a recital yesterday and I went just out of curiosity.  They sucked!  They sucked big time, and the best thing was, they finally knew it.  I hate that I'm gloating about someone else's favor, but...woohoo!  They sucked SO bad!  I went backstage to "congratulate" them, but Stuart had already left and Andrea was crying in a corner with our professor, so I hung back.  As they left, I noticed a piece of her music had fallen out of her bag.  It was only a copy, so I kept it to give to my professor later.  As I walked back to my car, I kept looking at the notes;  it was something I had seen before, but somehow there was a clarity to the finger patterns I had never noticed before.  Instead of seeing a blur of black on the page, I started seeing...sounds.  I could actually hear what the music should do before I ever played it.  I doubled back to the music building, grabbed my horn, and played for three hours without stopping.     Something had changed in the last nine months since I gave up in despair:  while Andrea and Stuart were worrying about passing recitals and getting jobs, they started hating what they were doing.  It was always a competition...always another struggle.   Putting down the horn forced me to realize just how valuable it was in my life as something I actually enjoyed.   Without broaching After School Special territory,  the "making special" part of my life didn't come from winning medals or scoring master classes.  It comes from the absolute bliss of knowing that perfection is just around the corner.    Andrea and Stuart:  I'm sorry you two tanked yesterday, and I'm sorry I didn't drop out of school last semester.  On the other hand, thanks for being the two biggest pricks I have ever met.  I think I had to wade through your shit for a while to figure out what I was really searching for.

      When I graduated from high school waaay back sometime in the late nineties, I won a scholarship that guaranteed me ten thousand dollars a year for four years, a chance to shake the President's hand, and a supercool trip to Orlando where I would receive my money at a star-studded television special which would be broadcast on TBS and attended by such celebrities as....Trisha Yearwood!  NBC's Anthony Edwards!  Star of stage and screen Bernadette Peters!  and many more!  Okay, so I obviously wasn't invited to the Kennedy Awards or anything, but for a seventeen year-old living basically in Bumfuck USA this was a BIG DEAL.  In fact, my inner monologue began considering it THE BIG DEAL...the crowning achievement of my life thus far.  While I walked across stage...indeed, the very stage that former Miss Americas teetered across as they snuffed up snot and waved to 27 million adoring viewers...my information would scroll across the screen--National Merit!!! Plays the horn!!! Doesn't like pork!!!!--and I would be named an Admsvision USA Scholar!!!!!!      !!!!!!   !  Ahem.  One year later, our benefactor, Val Adms, was marched out of his office in handcuffs and convicted for fraud and embezzlement.  If we had checked, we would have determined that Val Adms had been indicted for more counts of fraud then I have fingers and was giving away his remaining millions as a last-ditch effort to sway the prosecuting attorney in his favor.  The TBS special never aired, and the money never materialized.  I was a minor celebrity in the Mid-Mo region for about a weekend.  I think I really only used up about seven of my fifteen minutes of fame, which is encouraging.  I got interviewed by a bunch of local journalists, and I even got to take a call from a Today Show producer concerning the scam.  He decided to use  the winners from Massachusetts and New Jersey on the show since they were paying for Ivy League schools and more of a pity case than me and my state university bills (and also probably cheaper to transport to Rockefeller Center).   Life was boring again until three large packages were left at my front door.  A company called Microworx give all the "winners" a free computer.  The next month, the president of Microworx declared bankruptcy and went to jail for...wait for it....monetary fraud and embezzlement.  (LIBEL DISCLAIMER:  I'm pretty sure that's what happened--I could be wrong)  So anyway, being a college student with minus $40,000 in the bank means that the same computer that showed up on my doorstep in 1999 is the same computer that is sitting on my desk in 2004.  The computer was five years old when the company liquidated their assets and shipped our pity machines to us.  The poor old thing is so crappy it's funny:  all the technology is called Pentium or whatever 2000  in that hopeful way that pre-millenium stuff was always called 2000.  Max2000 Technology!  Because 2000 will be way more kickass than 1994!  It also uses more obscure hardware than an Alfa Romeo; I have at least three different USB adapters plugging in new accessories to my ancient computer tower and trying to upgrade my sad old 32 MB of RAM?  Forget it.   It's pretty much a relic, but it was free and I never turn down free shit.  I've been praying my computer lasts until Jay and I finish our respective degrees, and I was in a state of panic all this week because Windows has been fatally excepting every five minutes.  On a whim, I opened up the tower cover to see if anything had fallen apart or if a small animal had crawled in to die.    THE DUST!!  Oh my Lord, the dust.  Dust bunnies weren't accurate for this mess...I think they had been obliterated long ago by the colonies of dust Rottweilers that congregated in every corner and cranny of the tower.  When I blew into it, My face was literally coated with ten years worth of dirt.  I also realized that everything inside the tower was white hot because the computer fan was so full of dirt it couldn't turn anymore.  I rooted around for an hour until I found an air duster thingie Wynton left behind and sprayed the crap out of my computer.  Really. Crap might have been in there.  So...computer crisis averted for now.  I'm really glad I didn't have to euthanize my old buddy just yet...mostly because it doesn't have enough memory to locate and delete all the porn files Jay saved on my hard disk and I wouldn't want it going to computer heaven with all those free facial pics on its conscience.

      And if you know what I"m talking about, you're my new best friend/BFF/LYLAS/HAGS.  I am three days away from completing the death march known as finals week.  I'll be back next week sometime after I have turned in all my papers, assed my way through several presentations, and burned my apartment to the ground because it's an atrocious heap and I can't afford a housecleaner.  Peace out.

      1) Watching my dog sneak five steaks off the grill and down them, charred fat and all, in forty-five seconds.  2) Getting a call from my grandma at 7:30 this morning--she wanted to know if I'd fold church newsletters since "Mary Jonson has diarrhea from the same problem that gives [my grandma] gas"  3) The town consensus that life as we know it will much improve once our very first Domino's opens for business  4) Satellite TV, obviously.  5) Getting heckled, while in the pool, by a cropduster in a bi-plane.

      Did you know the word "snowman" has been eliminated from standardized testing?  Neither did I.  According to  urlLink this article , though, it is and should be replaced with "snowperson" so no one's offended.  In addition to this, the article lists several other words potentital test takers may react negatively to, including "American".  The purpose?  Eliminating class and cultural biases within our testing.  Another example: testers don't believe children in Florida should be required to either write or read essays about snowstorms, while urban children shouldn't be held accountable for their knowledge of crop rotation.  Fine.  It makes sense on one level, and gosh...thanks Iowa Testing or Harcourt or whoever for cushioning my comfort zone so much I don't even have to pretend other cultures exist, but shouldn't testing maybe reflect also how aware the students are of things that are happening outside their county line, especially if the subjects are only adding a "picture frame" for the actual purpose of testing?  I mean, I've never actually experienced a hurricane, but I'm pretty sure I could pick out the parts of speech in a sentence about one.    Testers are also afraid of bringing up "trigger subjects", like bullying or poverty because students may feel bad about their crappy, crappy lives.  In fact, one state (unnamed in the article) has eliminated the term "mobile home" or its derivatives because so many trailer-dwellers take the test.  Is matter of fact real life so dismal that test makers want to pretend it doesn't exist?  I would argue the most compelling, truthful writing these kids could do involves the very subjects we've mainstreamed out of our testing.   On the other hand, with the written portion of the SAT looming in the future of high schoolers, a much more interesting problem is certain to arise: students in wealthy districts who have almost completely transferred note taking, paper writing, and even student-teacher commmunication to electronic forms will be at a marked disadvantage over their less fortunate, rural and urban peers.  I have no doubt when the testers figure this out five years down the road, they'll switch to electronic input immediately which screws the 97% or so of students who don't have laptops at every desk, but in the meantime, the trailer trash, bullies, and snowmen will have their day in sun.*  I just hope colleges and test raters are able to read between the rhetoric and the vanilla-bland subjects, because otherwise we're wasting a whole lot of the class of 2005's time if they can't.    *(Those of you in Washington state or other equally rainy climates may want to substitute a different figure of speech in case you aren't fully comfortable with the word "sun")

      I spent Saturday driving through southeast Missouri--a bizarre moonscape of torn up highway and somewhat reclaimed farmland.  I watched a construction worker hose down the side of a newly built exit ramp with fertilizer and green food coloring, which gave the roadside scenery a surreal, art deco look to it.  Six hours, one Quarter Pounder, and a catnap in the Mountain Grove emergency room parking lot, I ended up back home in the cornfield.  I'm here now, awaiting The Big Day like a convict awaiting her final walk out of Death Row.  Cold feet?  And how.  In the meantime, I'm planning on being a Lady of Leisure.  I've given up trying to find a job that's willing to provide full time employment for six weeks and am focusing mainly on being very healthy and very helpful around the house.  I already have steaks marinating in the refridgerator and I've renewed my ironing duties with zeal.  I've also picked up the books I left here last time I came home.  I picked up  urlLink Nickel and Dimed  and finished it in two hours while I played sentry in the church nursery yesterday morning.  It, like  urlLink Fast Food Nation  filled me with moral repugnance and self-disgust for contributing to this blight, but again...what can we do about it?  How can you convince the wealthiest five percent of America (those who own Wal-Mart and McDonald's and, and, and...) to maybe fork over a tiny fraction of their net worth to give their employees a chance to maybe eat AND pay rent?  A letter writing campaign, maybe?  Stronger union organization in and around towns that support mega-stores?  Maybe a boycott of those companies? Communism? Somebody tell me and I'll be all over it. I hate myself for living right in the middle of poverty and being so ignorant about it at the same time.  I work $6.00 or $7.00/hour jobs on top of my regular one to afford my gym membership and pedicures for the wedding while people twice my age are working their two jobs to make the daily rates on a squalid motel room because they can't afford rental deposits for a real apartment. I'm disgusted with myself now...but again, how can you help out a struggling person if you end up putting yourself in danger of poverty, too?    I'm just whining and being ineffectual...enough. I'll remain, in the meantime, a Lady of Leisure in my cornfield.

      There are two things in my life for which I am utterly ashamed of myself: my credit cards and my driving habits.  The credit card situation is immaterial now, as it's pretty much under control.  I'm still awfully pissed at myself every time i make out a big fat check to credit counseling instead of a Volkswagen dealership.  But the driving...  I am terrified of four things: slugs, clowns, stepping down from high places, and driving.  The first three aren't that important unless I'm in the basement of my old house, watching IT, or hanging Christmas lights.  The driving thing is pretty unavoidable, and I end up scaring myself to death at least 4-5 times a day.    I was in a fender bender a couple of months ago, which I didn't think too much of until last week.  I got a call from my insurance lady, who told me my insurance had risen from $600 a year to $1600.  Apparently my "undesirable record of traffic offenses" had put me in the worst offender category of driver.  If I'm in one more wreck before 2006, I'm uninsurable.    The thing is, I'm NOT really a bad driver.  I drive like an 82 year old man on his way to the Western Sizzlin' for Tuesday coffee.  The only time I had ever REALLY sped on the highway was for an emergency, and it was also the only time I've ever gotten a ticket.  Two of my traffic accidents were in parking lots where the person I hit was either parked illegally or crowding the white lines.  I even tracked down one of those guys just to tell him I had scratched his car and to give him my insurance.  He fucking cried, CRIED, over his Olive Garden tortellini because I was so honest.  My reward?  A $700 insurance claim for a whole new bumper.    One of the other offenses on my record was a wreck  my mother  got into.  I wasn't even in the same town when it happened, but it still goes on my record since I was a dependant in 1999.  Is that even legal?  I've decided, henceforth, to learn how to ride a bike and navigate the mean streets of College Town, USA.  I hear if you get hit by a driver in a University crosswalk, you automatically get $5,000 and free tuition.  If I play my cards right, maybe I can actually pay my insurance.

      This one time at band camp...  I got paid shit for working 18 hour days.  Seriously, two weeks of bitchy kids and bad, bad instrument playing, and it ended up being like $3.33 an hour. Still, well worth as far as hanging out with some pretty cool people plus we got some kickass cafeteria food.  I almost creamed my pants on Pasta Showcase night.  Plus a kid insisted I made the best snacktime Kool-Aid ever.  It washed down the generic peanut butter crackers just right.  I can't believe I haven't posted in so very long.  I just get lazy and try to pretend I don't have a blog. I also completely missed out on the whole Laynewatch thing because of band camp, but I guess it was better that way.  I got all the info. without wasting my own time on Google.  I still type in plainlayne.dreamhost.com out of habit every time I get on the computer.  No offense, Quiplash, but it's still kinda disappointing to see your page instead of her stuff.  Real or not, I dug the writing.  I hope that corner of the blogosphere stays alive, but for its own sake and not Layne's.  I had a problem pandering to Layne's style of writing since she was one of my four readers, and I used to give up out of frustration.  There was no way I could turn a phrase like her, and my life certainly isn't as interesting.  NO ONE can make teaching music lessons or being a TA for the Badger interesting, not even Layne.  Anyway, maybe her absence will be a good thing for the little people in the blogging world.  Maybe not.  Either way, I'll miss the drama and I'll definitely miss reading about the girl in the mirror.

      I've been debating the last few weeks whether, or about what, to write.&nbsp; I'm over the cold feet-ness of the impending nuptials, so no annoying whiny angst to deal with there.&nbsp; Do I tell you how bizarre our 50 degree weather is?&nbsp; How everyone except Jay forgot my birthday on Tuesday&nbsp;and my grandmother brought over a frozen tub of soup instead of the ice cream she promised?&nbsp; How I spent far too many minutes&nbsp;agonizing over willow green or fern green colored towels at JC Penney when we put them on the registry?&nbsp;&nbsp;   Nah...my Ladye of Leisure anecdotes are mind-numbing to me, so no reason to bother you.&nbsp;   Since I'm relegated to 28.8K technology in the cornfield, and my parents are taking the computer in anyway, I don't think I'll be blogging until after the honeymoon.&nbsp; Take care of yourselves, and please feel free to check back in after August 22 or so.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll have some honeymoon pics (not THAT kind) posted, and I'll have more to talk about than my doggie's tapeworm battles and how much fun it is to steal corn from my neighbor's pasture.  Or, then again, I may realize that typing about crap is fun and I'll see you all tomorrow.&nbsp;   Best wishes.

      I forgot...the new Domino's, right?&nbsp; I got our&nbsp;pizza and&nbsp;our Cheesy Bread free last week because someone called in a bomb threat while I was waiting for my carry out.&nbsp; The best part was, the woman who called it in had left the store, irate, ten minutes prior because the manager wouldn't let her use their phone.&nbsp;
