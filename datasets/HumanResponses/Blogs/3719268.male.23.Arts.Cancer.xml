      So when making a blog its best not to still be drunk cuz you might.... Well... MISS SPELL YOUR DAMN NAME!!....True story. And then to top it all off I tried to say all this last night, and the damn thing crashed. Last nights version was so much more clever than today's, I was in tears on the floor, take my word on it, it might have just been my opus and the damn thing is gone lost forever on the internet. Side note: When I was drunk I hear this knock on the door and who was there of all people? I'll tell you, Al Gore and he was all like " can I crash here tonight" and then like 6hrs and lots of gin later we made a clay version of what we like to call "E2"  yah  he says its going to replace the internet in like the next year or two . My Sarah is back from her trip, I love her so much! I almost all but forgot how she can steal all the light from the stars so that the night is black and all you can see is her. How soft her lips are, the scent of her when she is next to me. Words they never said anything before she had whispered "I love you Bryan". Ok, I know I know you all don't want to hear it. But its true!

      Ok so look, maybe in the end the 1.75l of gin was not so good after all.  We don't haftto drink the whole thing tonight.... "What ever makes you sleep better" I would tell my self that self control is the way to be... But I didn't get the memo. quotes from last night are in no order:"I'm on 2ndes who wants 3ezes? " gin is good coffee is good I wonder what gin-coffee would taste like?" " shit its getting light out MOVE THE RAVE TO THE HALL THERE'S NO LIGHT THERE" "the morning is good Bryan light is our friend I think I'm going to just stay up the rest of the day" there's more but for some very odd reason I don't rember them. Damn I miss Sarah. I want to join the work force again. Did I say that I miss Sarah? cuz I do. Ok that's enough for the first blog post of my life. Now I'm trendy, right? right? Can I eat with the cool kids at lunch now?

      So Saturday was all good like I knew it would be.&nbsp; Sometimes&nbsp; life can work out, all you need is time.&nbsp; Now all I need is some coffee, BLA! Never, never, and listen to me on this one it could save your LIFE! Drink "Rockstar cola" yha its new from rockstar, and its like the buttness of rockstarr mixed with diet non brand cola OMG it suckes for those if you old or hip enough to recall  "jolt cola" yha its like that but taste way worse! And that's the tip of the day.

      Today as of yet did not rock.&nbsp;I so hope tomorrow will, I'm starting to feel lost, alone misunderstood and not needed, not by Sarah&nbsp; just by the whole earth.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What am I to you?  That you would ever think of me,&nbsp; As anything or better yet as something,&nbsp; Or &nbsp;someone other than your self,  For even a day to step out,  For even a hour to see,  For even a minuet to feel,  That you would ever understand.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bryan&nbsp;B Bennett

      For the most part when we find anything, any thing&nbsp;makes us, and then takes us, we can lose control we never had.

      I have no idea what that title means, but it sounds funny I guess well today was a dark day,ohhh poor me! LOL well is was but I cant help feel a little dumb talking about it to think about it I guess this ant talking about it cuz nobody reads this shit. I feel alone and helpless,stuck in a sea of dark bullshit and the only shining light is my Sarah. But I can depend totally on her that would not be fair she needs a strong friend now not a lost soul. ya know? I love her more than anything more than love that has passed by... Kd was right all along if I wasn't mend to be with her, then the person I was meant for must be better and at the time I didn't believe that but now that's soo true. You cant find a better person than her...shh she's on the phone... Well I got to go I'll re post this later.

      My life with out me will go on, the sun will set, the day will began again, and all things I never learned, I'll never learn. People will live. My life with out me goes on every day, only now I see it, before I didn't before I was blind. Now I see. Before I was dead, now I'm dead but watching my life go by.  See your reflection in a mirror and for once see your self. Feal joy, feel life, feel sorrow. And when your life passes you by, turn your head watch it go.

      Its 4 am and I'm tired. But all in all it was a good day, Sarah, err, my Sarah got a new car! I learned how to swim... And  my milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard! WTF? i saw the sticker that's gor me at the adult book store, it said "crack is bad for you" LOL.  Reasons why: 1. why people are sheep? cuz most people aren't cool enough to know that to be your self, no matter how silly or dumb you might think you are being sheep is way not even cooler. 2. Why mornings suck?   For me cuz A. I never can seem to fall asleep and when I do I like to stay that way. B. Dreams are what make me still believe in life, cuz we make dreams and they provide for us most thing that we would or cant do other wise. Why love can be the best thing ever?  See even in the question I answer is by saying "can be" love is or can be great! But we must know pain to know pleasure and choose to love not just feel something. That means even when it hurts we should love if you never jump you never take any chances, and then you might just find your self old and have 30 cats and be on first name baisis with the dude that you buy your tubs of "Ben and jerks" from! And last but not least 3. Why I love Sarah? Shies my morning star, my every thought, my best day, my reason, my rhyme, the air right after the rain comes and splashes on my face, the rock'est rocker that ever rocked my face off! My love, the word falls short at the sight of  the sun and moon envy her, the stars shine to be her and the wind carries its tune just for her. And that's all I have to say about that LOL.
