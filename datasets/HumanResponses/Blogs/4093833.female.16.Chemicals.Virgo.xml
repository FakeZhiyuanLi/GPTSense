        I feel loved. Anyways, idk if you saw my comment on your post about Wes, but he's not coming back this summer. At least, that's what he and his mom told me.      Jeeze, I miss all you guys so much. It's stinky that I had to stay home when some of you are finally coming back to Matawa. Oh, well. Have fun in week 5, and I'll see a bunch of you week 6!          btw, I'm all for the whole Great America CIT reunion. We all need to talk about who's available and when. (ooooo... just a random thought... we should make T-shirts!) lol

      Hey, y'alls!  I just had to say hi.  I'm feeling a little awkward right now.  This is my first week off after being at Matawa for a month.  I would still be there, but my fam wanted me home for a week.  I'm gonna be back week 6, though.  All of you better shine around if you're not workin at camp that week.  Rock on! =P'

      Oh boy oh boy it sure is great to be back in stinky Milwaukee. I'm fresh off the camp/Colorado caravan, and things that welcome me aren't exactly perfect. I went babysitting today and this two-year-old that I was babysitting bit me! And it was hard too. It's all red and purple with three tiny teeth marks. I should take a picture of it. I'll take a picture of it and post it later.    &nbsp;

      Hey guys, I'm trying to start the whole t-shirt thing, so if you guys would give me your sizes that'd be cool. Also, if you could, donate like 3 to 5 dollars for the making of the shirts. Hopefully, if I get everything done, they'll be tie-dyed with the four core colors with 'C.I.T 2004' on the back. I beat you, Bri, I start school in 4 days. So unfair.

      something in South Carolina happened which i feel entitled to tell all of you. i pooped my pants. i was on a kayaking trip in the calibogue sound and felt a strong stomach pressure... so i paddled my little butt over to the beach and ran in to the woods... but before i could get to a safe distant out of sight of my colleagues i shat right in my pants... a good sized yule-log right in to my underwear... i just needed to tell you guys. i probably should have never put that in to writing.

        Wooo hoooo! I am soooo excited I could burst! I'm coming back to Matawa tomorrow! Let's see... I have about 15 hours and 23 minutes until I leave for camp. But who's counting? I am so happy that I get to finally see some of you for the first time in almost a month. EVERYONE better write or show up or something this week cuz this is it... Week 6...          We got the best camp in the nation. Right on!
