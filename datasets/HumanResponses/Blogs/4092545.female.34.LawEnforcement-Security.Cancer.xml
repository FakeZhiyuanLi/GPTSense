        Well, I decided to try my hand at BLOGGING. It's a little different journaling in a place that I know others can see. Usually I keep my journaling private and NO ONE ever sees it. So I guess I will just have to be careful what I write here. I do want to be able to express myself fully though, so anyone who reads this will know my inner thoughts. I really hope my BLOGGING doesn't bore anyone. I am sure it will though.        I guess I should start at the beginning.       I was raised, along with two older brothers, by my mom. She did a great job raising three kids on a single woman's salary, working in a sewing factory. I went through a pretty deep identity crisis I guess as a teen. I got married at 15, became a mother at 16. I don't know why I did it. I don't know if I was running away from something or running toward something. But I know I was running, and I wasn't looking to see where.       Of course the marriage didn't last. There was some abuse, but I won't go into great detail about that. I have put it behind me, healed and moved on.       I took a job working in a sewing factory. I wanted to be married. That's what I was SUPPOSED to do wasn't it? Grow up, find a man, CATCH him and live happily ever after. That's what good girls do, right? So I failed the first time. I was 19, and was getting married again. This time I didn't love him and I knew it. But he was willing to marry me. He had his own reasons, and I had mine. We talked about them, and decided to help each other out. A few months later, we divorced.       I was extremely upset. Everyone thought I was upset because I loved him and would miss him, but that wasn't it. I was upset with myself for failing again. I decided to just be single for awhile. So, now working at a different sewing factory, this time sewing garments instead of shoes, I found an apartment and was again raising my daughter on my own. I know this sounds cliche, but times were tough. I didn't have a car, I had very little money, and I now had rent and utilities to pay.       I suffered through the first year using baking soda to brush my teeth and wash my hair, because I couldn't afford toothpaste and shampoo. My daughter had toothpaste and shampoo, but I couldn't use hers because then I would just have to buy more, and foodstamps don't buy toothpaste and shampoo.       I remember the first year that I got back my very own income tax return! It was awesome!! I bought myself a living room suite, my daughter some nice clothes and a five-hundred-dollar car. I felt like I was on my way to becoming a productive member of society. All on my own.       I stayed single for about three more years, gaining monetarily but not in selfworth. I still felt like a big loser because I couldn't fulfill the obvious dream of catching a man.      I learned a lot during this time.  I learned how to change the oil in my car, and how to replace sparkplugs and an altenator.  I learned how to manage money.  I could pay all the bills and still have enough left over to buy things that I needed like toothpaste and shampoo.  I could even take my daughter to Wal-mart and buy her a new pair of shoes when she needed them, not when I could scrape the money together.  But I wasn't happy.  How could I be when there was no man to take care of me?            So, once I started having a little extra money, I started going out.  I didn't go far, I didn't trust my five-hundred-dollar Nissan too far from town.  Mostly, I just cruised around the town I lived in.  I knew most of the other kids who were cruising, but I was the only one who cruised with my daughter in the car with me.  Sometimes my mom kept her, sometimes I took her with me.  Let' face it, I was in the market for a new man.  I met several, but none of them wanted to date someone who had a child.  Most of them just thought I was easy because it was obvious I had already had sex.  They were after one thing and I was after another, and most of the time, they won.  I never got what I was looking for.            I decided to go back to school.  I didn't really know what I wanted to be yet, but they said I could decide that later, after my first two years of college.  I was 21, I had two divorces under my belt, I was a single mom, and I was miserable with my life.  I knew I had to do something.  College was the answer.  I signed up at the local Community College for some basic classes.  I spent less time going out and more time doing homework.  But I knew I was in the right place, because I could meet a college boy now.  That's right, it was always about finding a man.            Then one day, just before Thanksgiving, I ran into a guy that I had gone to highschool with.  He was a year behind me in school, and we never really talked much in school, but we had known who each other was.  He asked me out and I agreed, I was still looking for that someone to cling to.  After all, everyone knows a woman isn't worth as much if she doesn't have a man in her life, right?  This guy was a good catch, too.  He had a good job, a new truck and came from what you would call a prominent family.  So I had to do whatever it took to CATCH him.  Whatever I did, it worked.  He asked me to marry him.    We decided to live together first, I was scared.  I knew I was no good at this marriage thing.  When I told him that, he insisted that it wasn't me, that it was just that I had chosen the wrong person before.  He showed himself to be the perfect man.  He helped with the housework, and never complained when I wanted to go to yet another Home Interior Party with my family.  He didn't seem to mind when I spent a little too much and he always bought me nice birthday gifts and sent me flowers at work.  I was falling in love.    I was living every girl's dream.  I was getting what I had always wanted: a man with a good job and every one thought he was a good catch.           We decided to live together before we got married.  He said it would make me feel more confortable after being through so much in the past.  I thought it was a good idea for the same reason.  We were planning on getting married someday anyway, so it was the thing to do.  Things were going pretty great for me at the time.  He and I were becoming very close.  We did a lot of fun stuff together, and we shared a lot about our pasts.  He had come from a wealthy family and had no real problems growing up, so he didn't understand some of the thigns I had shared about my past.  He was very kind to me, and I was falling in love more and more everyday.            I was still in college and he seemed to be very supportive about it at first, but as time progressed, he started say he was afraid I was going to meet some college boy and then I wouldn't want him anymore.  I tried to explain to him that the life I had with him was all I ever really wanted, but he must have been very insecure.  He continued to make comments and it got to the point that he would show up at the college before my classes or during the break in between, just to say hi.  I, being young and naive at the time, thought that was very sweet and that he must really love me a lot to go through all that trouble just to see me.  Eventually, the pressure became too much for me to handle, and I just quit school.  It really didn't matter anyway, I had A MAN, didn't I?          Not long after I dropped out of college he shared a story with me about an ex-girlfriend whom he said he had broken up with.  Several months later he had found out that she had aborted his unborn child.  He had no idea that she had been pregnant, and had no say in that decision.  He claimed to feel like something was missing in his life now.  It became obvious to me that he wanted another child, so I happily agreed to stop taking the birth control.  I found out that I was pregnant on my 22nd birthday (remember that point, it will have significance again in about three years).  We were both very excited about the coming baby.  We moved into a bigger apartment, bought some new furniture and started buying baby items.  I was living a dream.           Well, I must stop the story there for now.  I am sure I have left out somethings that are would be of interest to anyone who is interested enough to read this BLOG in the first place.  I promise I will add the things I left out as I remember them.  I may even go into more detail of the abuse inflicted by my first husband.  But that will come later, when or if I become more comfortable publishing my story.  Until then, enjoy reading what is here, and I will fill in the blanks at some time in the future.  God Bless and thank you for taking time to read my story.
