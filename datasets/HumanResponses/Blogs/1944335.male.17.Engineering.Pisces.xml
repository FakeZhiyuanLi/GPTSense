      OMG OMG, I haven't updated my blog in like a week, I am the worst blog keeper guy in the world *suicide*.  Well let's see, what to talk about, ok, I hate band as usual, takes up too much time, had practice on Monday at standridge, that was the first day this week that my dad let me drive someplace by myself.  It was liberating, knowing that I could go anywhere I wanted, hit anyone I felt like... I had to though, because it was too late to call someone for a ride, and everyone was gone.    On Tuesday I went to Daniel's house and we made our egg drop project.  It was pimp because I got to drive there as well.  We made a pyramid out of cardboard and used duct tape to put it together.  We cut a hole in the bottom to put the egg and marshmallows in, then I drove him down to the field to drop it off of the tower, and it survived, twice.  Then we went back to his house, and played magic, of course.  It was sweet though, because when I went home I only had to do the English questions, and I was done.    On Wednesday, we got to test our egg drop, and it survived.  I was happy, but it weighed like 350 grams so it wasn't that great.  Next year, I hear we have to make our egg drop out of only straws. That should be fun.  Well, we had band after that, which was of course gay.  It is such a waste of time, god damn.  Well, at least I get a free drumline shirt since I am poor and all.  When I got home, I'm pretty sure I played dod, but I cant really remember, and I also had to do the 2 extra credit things for McKee.  The one quiz grade brought my grade up 8 points.  The other things added 10 points to a test grade, which should bring me to about a 94 or something.  I think that's what she told me.  Man, it is ridiculous how much extra credit we get in that class... Its a freakin AP class, and we get more extra credit than any of the classes we had as freshmen.  Im not complaining though, since I am a slacker and all.    On Thursday, I had to do out federalist song during tap, I don't really remember though.  It was to Ice Ice Baby, but it was so dumb.  We almost didn't go up there, until I asked her if we could go.  I wish I could remember how it went, but as soon as it was done, i threw my copy away.  Oh god the humiliation.  Anyway, we had band after that, and we sucked as usual.  Caleb finally quit, so thats a plus! And no I am not kidding.  Now we have to play our parts twice as loud, and learn new parts.  Gay.  The best part of Thursday, however, was when I realized that I had no homework in any class.  That was great, and I played dod for a while, as usual.  I also found a program to make an ftp server, but for some reason, it stopped working.  Megha helped me test it. and it worked, but it stopped working when I got to school.  It was gay, I wanted to get all my music and shit from school...  On Friday, nothing special happened.  I had band, then english, and in english we talked about our narrative thing.  Man, english is soo easy.  After english I had cisco, where we just copied curriculum to the computers all class period.  It was so pointles,but at least we got to play magic.  After cisco, we had physics, and all we did was learn learn about acceleration and stuff like that.  Easy as usual.  I then went  to the bandhall to load the truck, then went home to play dod.  When it was time to leave, I convinced my dad to let me drive to school, and drive back after the game, by myself.  It was fun, but I got to the band hall to early and there was no one there.  I sat there for about 30 minutes, and the Jessica walked in.  I played magic with her for a while, then we changed into out uniforms and left for the game in Grand Praire.  On the bus, I played some number game with troy, which i lost everytime, because he knows the pattern, and I was just throwing out random numbers.  Well, we did our show, but the field had no track,and we were tight for space.  We fell apart in the beginning, but recovered and did okay for the rest.  Our team ended up losing 49-17 or something like that, but I could care less.  It's pointless to get caught up in something that has no bearing on your life.  It makes you feel miserable for no reason, and there is no way to remedy it, so just dont worry about it.  Thats my philosophy.  Anyway, we got back at like 11:30, I took Daniel home, then I went home.  I downloaded freeciv, but didnt pay it, because I fell asleep.    On Saturday, I again, conviced my dad to let me drive myself somewhere.  This time, I drove to Creekview for SAT class.  OMG, I did so badly.  I got like a 186 for my index and a 1200 on the SAT....  *suicide*  WEll, I will do better, I dont even think I could get into a Texas college with those scores...  Well, I played dod with some people, i think, then watched the matrix reloaded to finish the night off.  It was good.  Now for today, I did nothing except blog.  I will post more later, but I promised my clan members I would play dod with them, i have been neglecting dod a lot, and now I really suck and yeah... I am starting to not get my skill back so I am screwed.     P.S.  I hate band :)

      Man, i was just reading Troys blog, and I realized that I haven't updated mine since Thursday.  well, went to the Mirrodin pre release on Saturday, it was great.  I went 2-1, and on the last game, the guy and I were 1 and 1, and the judges had called time, so we didn't have time to play another match.  It was either split the packs or no one got packs.  We decided to flip a coin and whoever lost would take a loss and would get 3 or the 5 packs.  I lost the coin toss, but I got a foil Luminous Angel in one of the packs, which I predict will be worth a lot in the near future.  Also, there was this deal where we could buy 1 tournament pack (75 cards) and get another for free.  I did, and I got an Exalted Angel in one.  So i went right around a sold it back to them for $8.  Now to recap.  Went there with no cards except the ones I had before and no money, sold some cards to get $9, borrowed $1 from Matt to buy those 2 tournament packs, sold the Angel for $8, got 3 packs from that guy, got a foil rare, sold one of the other rares for $2, left with 300+ new cards and $10.  I think I will make a living from going to magic pre releases and selling and buying cards. heh...  And I also have to do that egg drop project.  After the pre release, Daniel and I went to his house and tried to work on it, but we only got like 10 minutes in on it and spent the rest of the time either trading, watching this old AMAT movie made by the seniors from 02, or playing magic.  yeah, really productive...  Oh yeah, and I forgot to tell you gus that I hate my life.  This song like sums up my life Sometimes I wish I was brave I wish I was stronger I wish I could feel no pain I wish I was young I wish I would try I wish I was honest I wish I was you not I  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, just mad I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  Sometimes I wish I was smart I wish I made cures for How people are I wish I had power I wish I could leave I wish I could change the world For you and me  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, just mad I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  'Cause I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, just mad I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over  I feel so mad I feel so angry I feel so callous So lost, confused, just mad I feel so cheap So used, unfaithful Let's start over Let's start over   And that is like the worst song I have ever heard...  Oh, and I hate band :)

      AHHH, its 10:40 and as usual, I have not done any homework.  Now for recap, went to precal, failed the test, went to comp sci, coded a thing for karel so that he can get out of any maze, went to Spanish, left Spanish... And finally, I went to US History, where sadly enough I think I failed the test we took.  Well maybe not failed, but did tn do so well on.  Anyway, played magic with Daniel, Jessica, and Casey after school, but ran outta time.  Then band...i hate band.  After band I came home and watched The Patriot so I could write a bullshit report on it and get 10 points on one of my test grades, preferably the test I just bombed.  Well, it was about 7 or 8 when I started playing dod.  This week has been a good week for dod for me, as well as for matt.  Today, i went a solid 2:1 with like 120 kills and 60 deaths.  DoD is starting to bore me now, I need to stop playing it so much.  Well thats it... i hate my life!

      Okay, now to recap the entire day.  Woke up late today, got to band at 7:20, I hate band...After band, went to English, got a 0 on grade, then to tap and Cisco.  Got another failing grade in Cisco and then I went to physics.  Physics was fun, did vector stuff, made fun of Hurst.  Good times.  Got home at 3 and played DOD with matt, PWN3D everyone with a friggin 4:1 score.  That means I killed 4 people for every one death I had on average.  It was great.  BLAH, I hate school, I hate band, I hate people, I hate everything, I hate you most likely.  End...

      Currently Listening to: NIN - Heresy  Just got back from drumline, now I am working on book report for extra credit in US History.  I don't really have anything else to do today, I might do some precal and a little history reading though.  I also have to submit an online quiz for History.  Im not even sure if it is due tomorrow, but McKee had "11/1" written in red marker on the board, and that is a Saturday...  I just thought it woudl be better to be safe than to not turn it in and get no credit.  So yeah.....  Man I love the song Heresy, it makes me want to go out and shoot up a bunch of defenseless women and children   And no, I am not kidding, i would seriously like to shoot someone point blank with a desert eagle, obliterating their face 2 feet away from me...

      Currently Listening to: nothing  I am bored, there is nothing to do, I have no homework, and blah!!!!  No band today so thats a plus.  I guess I could play dod or something, or maybe I could taunt megha about me keeping her birthday present, thats always fun...  Lets recap the day, started off with precal where all we did was a benchmark.  Was somewhat hard, but not too much.  In computer science I got on the American pageant website to take some online quizzes, but i was only able to do like 2.  In tap, i was able to finish the hardest part of the precal project and reduce the time it would have taken me to do it at home to 10 minutes tops.  In spanish we did this composition about where i would be in 20 years.  I wrote some bullshit about living in the suburbs of Boston with a wife that is a doctor, 2 kids, a dog and a cat.  I would be an engineer or something and we would be pretty well off.  Psh, like thats ever gonna happen....  Then in US History, we took the unit test, which wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.  I missed a few, but it probably was not that bad.  At the end of the day, I stuck this illegal parking sticker on some persons car, but they were able to take it off! it was gay. but oh well....  I dont feel like going to ac dec today, so i wont.  I will just stay home and be even more bored, that way I can go and hang myself in a couple of hours...  I also want a job, like matt.  I have a car now, and band is almost over, so why not.  Plus, it will help me keep the gaming to a minimum, as well as earn me money for Christmas presents, or maybe even computer parts for a new computer!!!  YAY

      Currently Listening to: NIN - March of the Pigs  Hey, guess what, I am bored as usual.  I just got back from some place called CD Addict, on Josey and Trinity Mills near Target.  I was looking for "The Downward Spiral" by Nine Inch Nails, but they didn't have it.  I also looked at CD Warehouse on Beltline in Addison, but they dont have it either.  Oh well....I guess I will just download it :)    Right now I have to type something for my dad, study for the Ap US History Unit test, study spanish verbs, and do a Comp Sci worksheet, and thats after I did all my precal and some spanish on Friday night....I hate school  Well hey, at least I dont have a sectional tomorrow! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh wait, I have Ac Dec, dammit....

I didnt go very well in the first game. but I was like 14-4 in the second one.  Not bad for not having played for a while.    I just finished watching Battle Royale, that was a crazy movie.  Its about 42 kids and how they have kill each other to get off some island.  thats all i will say, because i am lazy.    Blah, I am so bored...

Just came back from CiCi's, it wasnt as bad as I thought it would be.  Ate a lot of pizza, got drunk, and reminisced of old times back in middle school and elementary school.  Also, Megha decided she was gonna take me to see The Matrix Revolutions, and get the ticket for me since she will be 17 next Wednesday.  w00t!, now I dont have to take my mom like I had to, to see the Matrix Reloaded. :)   Ah yes, and dont forget, "It wont give up, it wants me dead, goddamn this noise inside my head!".  .....sorry troy

      Currently Listening to: Nirvana - Come as you are  omg, IE crashes everytime i open it, and i couldnt update my blog until today, since my sisters are finally out of the house and not using this computer.  i think i have some crappy spyware on my comp and that is causing IE to crash.  i need to find someone that has Adaware so they can give it to me over AIM or something.  anyway, i have band from 530-730 today.  after that i might go to CiCi's to hang out with mah peeps.  uh yea... but i really dont wanna go to band.  i have a bad feling i am getting kicked out since i was 1 hour late yestarday.  oh man that was a bad day.  my mom left the light on in her car and the battery died, so she used my car to go to work.  well, when she got back home, she took the crappy van we have and took my sisters to gymnastics, but she also took my keys, so i had no car.  i had to get the battery of the white buick, my moms car, and take it to autozone to get recharged, then i had to install it, get dressed, and finally i got to the game just as everyone was heading up to the stands.  anyway, i didnt call mashbun because all i had was his home number, and i didnt even think about calling matt until it was like 6, but by then his cell was in his hatbox and he couldnt get to it.  i got cut mainly ebcasue i didnt call msahburn to let him know i was gonna be late the first time back in the summer, so yeah... either way, im fine with it, except for the fact that i still have $120 in my band account and i wont be able to get it....man i am stingy....

      Currently Listening to: nothing  Wow, first time blogging in almost three weeks.  Working on the scarlet letter thing right now, but family guy is about to come on so I think I will watch that. I have one thing to say to end this blog, and it is not directed to any one person.  It is just something a lot of people need to incorparate into their lives  People need to be at least somewhat modest.  Not all the time or anything like that, but if you can be modest once in an while, it wont make them look like complete assholes.  I swear, I know some people that are so arrogant that I come around to almost hating them for a while...    that is all

      Currently Listening to: nothing  I finally figured out the problem with my ftp site.  Comcast changed my god damn IP for some strange reason.  Kyle says that they do that every so often for security reasons, so I will just believe that.   Blah, nothing has happened so far today.  I got a 100 on the history quiz, and I got an A in that class for the six weeks.  I am happy, since I dont try that much.  I think I wont try that much from now on.  :)  Now I have to do some precal and spanish since I wont be home for a while tomorrow, it's All District Tryouts.  Also, I have band today at 5:30.  Bah.  After band I iwll probably work on region music and maybe do some history reading...  My life is so boring.....

Damn, and it took me forever to find that one.  Heh, it was cool, when I was reading megha's blog, i went right  over to troy's, and it was like they were talking to each other.  OR maybe its the half gallon of vodka I just drank, i dont know.  meh...  Heh, I just checked how much I could sell some of my cards for, and it got up to like $70.  The best part was that I wasn't finished putting all the cards in, IM GONNA BE RICH!!!  I just got through playing dod with rickey.  Man I sucked today.  I just barely broke even and it was like 2 minutes before the game ended.  At least I did better than rickey, heh jk.    Man, I am listening to some of the NIN mp3's I got the other day.  NIN is so much better than I thought they were originally.  Unlike other bands, they actually play music and not some droning, monotonous techno beat.  Sometimes I really hate that.  But yeah... I am going to go and do some precal and history reading...

      Currently Listening to: NIN - Eraser  Yay, I just finished downloading 17 NIN cds from bit torrent.  It was almost a gig, but I dont care.  Now I have like 200+ more mp3s.  If you want to check them out, they are on my  urlLink FTP server .  IM me for the username and password.  Also, I have decided that I will stay in band provided that I make honor band this year.

      Currently Listening to: nothing  HAHAHAHAHA.... We got 0 point at the programming contest this morning...and the worst part was, we spent 1 and a half hors of 2 hours working on a 2 point problem and we didnt finish.  If we had started on a differnt 2 point one, or even an easy 5 point we would have had at least 9 points.  This was our first contest though, and all they asked about were array's, which we hadn't learned yet... oh well, it was still really fun, and we got a lot of free food.  YAY!!  When I got home, I came to the horrible realization that the cable internet and tv were out all over the neighborhood.  I cried and cried.  I was about to commit suicide, but I fell asleep for like 5 hours.  I woke up just now.  I am bored. Die.    [adultswim]

      Currently Listening to: Audioslave - Like a Stone  Damn Megha, I was just saying that troy said it in his blog, granted I said it like 5 times, but geez.  You know me, always senselessly making fun of people  Anyway, it was an okay day today.  Precal was hella-easy, but it felt like it took forever.  In computer science, I finished my lab like 30 minutes before everyone else, so I got to slack off for 45 minutes.  I am glad I finally get how to create and use object methods.  In TAP, I slept a little, and afterwards, went to Spanish.  In Spanish, we are supposedly learning the "HARDEST THING WE WILL EVER LEARN IN SPANISH", which is the subjunctive mood.  Basically, its used when one talks about hypothetical situations, and its pretty easy...  The worst part of my day was US History, mainly because I hate McKee and the retarded people in the class.  I slept through a lot of the class though, so that was good.    When I got home, I got a call from Albertsons to go to an interview tomorrow, afterschool.  w00t!!! If I can get a job, I will be able to pay for Comcast Pro, which is increased bandwidth.  I will also start saving for a new computer, which should take a while.  It will be my first computer building project, so it should be fun.    At 6, I went to Ac-Dec where we practiced our impromptu speeches.  My first one sucked a lot, mainly because I had absolutely nothing to say.  I mean, come on, "do you support indian casinos?".  What the hell kind of topic is that?  I hope I dont get a crappy topic at HP, because I am gonna suck enough as it is..  I might just end up skipping it if I dont think of a speech topic soon... AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111111  Thank you megha for getting me to blog again  [end]

      Currently Listening to: NIN - Head like a hole  Okay, many cool things tha happened today.  First off, I finally got my permit, so only 6 more months until I can legally drive.  Also, after I got my permit, I went and picked up my first real paycheck of $62.65.  They took out about 7.23 (it was 69.88 originally).  I worked a total of 10 hours and a couple of minutes, so it isnt that bad, especially for a bag boy... So when I got home, something eles happened.  I was done downloading some cd's from bit torrent, which finally put me over the 1000 mp3 mark, the 4 gig of mp3 mark, and the 3+ days of straight music in my playlist mark all at the same time. w00t i win

      Currently Listening to:    Avoidant  Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by extreme social anxiety. People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.  That is just about dead on.  Well, just thought I'd try to get a blog in before the day is up

      Currently Listening to: NOFX - Please play this song on the radio  Still feeling depressed today, seems to be the trend this week... Come home, sleep, wake up and stare at my computer, drowning in my own self pity.  Meh, whatever.  Anyway, kinda excited about tomorrow, our first B day for a long time and stuff.    I am still so out of it.  Today, I had totally forgotten about the car accident until lunch.  I also came home and was surprised to find this second monitor near my computer.  I really need to fix it, because I cant imagine this is very healthy.    I did the Marine Biology Case Study, well most of it, today.  It's on the server if you want to take a look at it.  Right now, I need to do the practice AP Computer science test and read Gatsby, so yay.  Hopefully tomorrow will be the day.  If not, I will have to wait about a week, because of AP tests.  God I hope I can do it.

      Currently Listening to: Nine Inch Nails - The Becoming  Wow...haven't been here lately.  Last blog was over 3 months ago.  I guess I just really felt that I had something to tell.  Today, my dad got into an accident after dropping my youngest sister off at school.  He got broadsided while on Beltline by a huge car by the looks of it.  They had to cut the door off to get him out of the car.  Luckily, he was okay except for a few bumps and bruises.  He went completely unconscious and he doesn't remember if the police got the other guys information.  Well anyway, the car was completely totaled and the police report will not be done until Friday, so until then I will not know if I can get to school in the mornings, if my sister can get to school, if I can still go to work, or if I will be able to get around next week for the AP tests.   This whole incident has brought a few things to my attention.  First off, we do not live forever.  You can't just think that you are invulnerable to everything, you just cant.  People are always telling me how they speed and dont get caught, or how they do something completely stupid and illegal on the road, and it makes me cringe to hear that.  I really dont want to here about any of my friends dying in a car crash because they were speeding or something stupid like that.  My friends are probably the only thing keeping me sane, and although I'd rather not say this, alive, right now.  At this time in my life, I dont think I could stand to lose someone I really care about.     Also, with the whole mortality thing, you never know when it is your time to go.  We have such a short time on this earth, and we need to make the best of it.  Since saturday, well since 8th grade really, I have these feeling for someone, and as of lately I can hardly get myself to talk to her.  I know I have to at least talk to her in real life(as opposed to AIM), but I cant bring myself to do it.  As weird as this sounds though, this whole incident might help me out with that.   After looking back on what has gone on in the past few days, I cant help but feel something missing.  So many things feel so trivial to me right now, school of course, video games, my life.  The only thing I seem to find meaning or worth in is that girl and my family.  I just cant help but feel that I have wasted my life thus far.  I mean, what have I got?  A computer.  Thats it, that is all that I felt had any worth a few weeks ago.  But when I got home today, before I heard about the accident, I didnt even remember I got that second 17 inch monitor the day before.  I dont seem to want to play games anymore, even though that was my refuge from reality.  Hell, I don't even listen to music anymore.  It all seems to pointless.  School is even worse.  How can anyone appreciate something that cant even challenge some kids, while leaving others in the dirt.  We have to sit there and dig what knowledge, we feel we should have, out while other kids are wasting their god damn lives not doing anything.  Everyone is complaining that are education system is so bad, but they fail to see is that most of us have a mind of our own.  Some of us realize that we wont ever need to analyze a poem or write an essay on the impact of Jefferson's embargo on the US in 1812, when we are going to be doctors, and programmers, and computer technicians.  Why waste the time learning it for so it can be forgotten a week later.  The way I see it, if we had specialized schooling, schooling designed to teach one every aspect of what ones career would soon be, kids would be more interested in school and the education could be challenging.  Sure there would be room for english and history and such, but not to such an extreme extent as we take it to at school right now.  So many countries do that right now, and that is why their educations systems have been so successful.    I also have to quit my job because of the whole transportation issue.  That doesn't really seem to bother me much though, so I think that I am okay with it.  I am just glad that all of this didn't happen when I had a decent job or something, not to be selfish.  So.. not much to say about that.  TAKS is the going on this week, and it infuriates me that we could spend so much time studying for the math part, and close to no time going over the science concepts that we were taught over 2 years ago.  I know for sure that I didn't do well on that test at all.  I past it alright, but I didn't do as well as I thought I was going to do.  Tomorrow is the social studies test, and I figure that should be a little easier since it is a little more interesting to me.   Last Friday to Monday was the band trip to Corpus.  That was probably the best bandtrip I have been on so far even though the only time it was sunny was about 30 minutes before we left to come back to Dallas.  We played chess, we talked, and we were so open about it all.  That kind of thing is so refreshing, and for me rightfully so since I had never been open to anyone in my entire life.  Most of the food sucked and the places were boring, but at least I had a good time with my friends.   When I got back, the first thing I had to do was get a haircut.  I didn't mind it that much, but when it gets windy, my head gets really cold.  From Monday till now, I have had this persistent feeling of depression and anger.  I know I have to talk to her, and maybe I can do it this week, I don't know.  I also came to the realization about some things I didn't like about myself.  Luckily I am already trying to fix them, as well as my other problems.  So wish my luck.  And of course...the quiz:      Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    High       urlLink Schizoid :    High       urlLink Schizotypal :    High       urlLink Antisocial :    Moderate       urlLink Borderline :    Very High       urlLink Histrionic :    High       urlLink Narcissistic :    Moderate       urlLink Avoidant :    Very High       urlLink Dependent :    High       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Moderate       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --

      Currently Listening to: Green Day - Basket Case  So I just realized that maybe, just maybe, if I actually blogged, people might read it.  So here it goes.    Today was my last day of school.  I am exempt from all my exams, so yay for me.  Today, I woke up at like 10:40 and went to school.  In Cisco we took some feedback exam to graduate.  Then I took this voucher exam to get a discount on the CCNA, but I got a 52... Meh, I basically guessed on everything, so whatever.  In fizzix, Hurst was reviewing for the final while Troy and I were yelling out random crap.  Then we watched an AMAT movie about geeks.  So what was my last day of school; exciting, I know.  After school, I came home, then left for Brookhaven to sign up for Government and Economics for the summer.  Apparently we were supposed to do that 3 weeks ago, so he said that there are very few classes available.  Tomorrow I have to go up there and take that Accuplacer test since I don't have my writing TAKS scores yet, and since I haven't taken the SAT.    Holy crap, my blog is so boring.  I get this weird feeling that as long as I am not typing about something deep or introspective, it is boring.  That is how I feel about others peoples blogs anyway.  Good thing I have such interesting friends though :)  So, for something a little deeper, I am still feeling like crap.  I think I totally blew everything, so I pretty much am through with it. [To be honest, I lost my train of though here, so I will continue it in a different blog if I can pick up on it later.]  Anyway, today Matt and I were talking to the band directors about how Angel was the drumline captain.  Basically, it was like this.  If Angel is the drumline captain, I am quitting, because there is no way I am going to go an entire year under the rule of someone with the mental capacity of a retarded 4 year old.  Not only does he lack proper grammatical skills and vocabulary, he lacks common sense.  I am not interested in taking orders from someone that will most likely fail every one of his AP classes next year and someone that can't play worth shit.  And for Cansler to call us hypocritical because of not displaying leadership skills is total bullshit.  Four other people felt the same way about this, and for Matt and I to be the first ones to confront the band directors about shows leadership, at least in my eyes.  I don't see how taking a stance for something we feel strongly for is both not taking leadership and hypocritical.  It's weird though.  After I left Moen's office, I realized that I was a little happy.  I think that I really like it when I make people mad, or when people are pissed at me.  I don't know, that sounds really weird.  Maybe I am like an emotional masochist or something.    So, to sum up, YAY, I love dumping my scattered thoughts into blogger for the whole world to see!!  I'll try to blog later, and for those unanswered question most of you will undoubtedly have, I am saving the answers for the comments.

      Currently Listening to: Colours Movement 4  I seem to be able to hide my feelings really well.  I think about how I have been feeling for the past couple of days and realize that the things I do don't reflect upon how I feel.  It's that old coping mechanism doing its thing again.  I cope with my depression by acting weird and retarded.  And when you think about it, I do that a lot... hmmmm....I just discovered something.  Anyway, I have been listening to Colours 4 a lot; it seems to bring me comfort.  It is probably the most uplifting song I have heard in a long time, and it seems to make me happy.  It feels weird listening to it though; the whole making me happy thing.  I haven't been truly happy in a very long time.  Well, since last summer and the stuff that went on then, anyway, but its still around a year ago.  That seems like a long time to go without being truly happy.  Because of it, I feel somewhat uncomfortable, yet drawn to that piece.  Man, this feeling is getting worse and worse everyday.  I am so confused, and I sometimes think that I may need psychatric help or something, like maybe I am slowly going insane.  I have been overly paranoid and scared about nothing lately, so maybe I am going insane.  Hell, at least it would be a change to the rut I have been in for the last couple of months.    So anyway, it's like 12:45 and I am incredibly tired, so I am going to bed.  I guess I won't ever blog when I say I will, so I'll just do it randomly.  Check my profile sometimes and see if I did or not, and leave comments if you want to.

      Currently Listening to: Weezer - Island in the Sun  Decided to get in a quick blog before I forget again today.  Took the AP Physics test on monday, and it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.  I knew a lot of the multiple choice, and the free response that I knew how to do were pretty close to what Hurst's tests are like.  I'm pretty sure I didn't pass it though, because I skipped every question having to do with light waves and lens, so coupled with the questions I got wrong and the free response that I didn't know how to do, I'll be lucky if I get a 2.  It doesn't really matter though, because now I have experience with the test, and I am also exempt from physics. :)  That makes every class except for precal and cisco.  If I keep the 91 that I have in precal, I'll definitely be exempt, but we can't be exempt from Cisco.  Blah.  Anyway, later today, I have the NHS induction, then I have precal homework, so no games for me today.  Thats all for now, I will try and blog after the induction

I will use this template probably for a week or so until I have enough time to modify it.  And yeah, see Megha, I got the comments up there!  Not much to blog about, as usual.  Tomorrow I have the AP Physics test, then I have to do like 3 god damn projects before I am dome with school.  YAY!!!!

      Currently Listening to: Switchfoot - Learning to Breathe  When I look back on my life so far, I find it hard to believe that I have kept such a straight face about it.  My father hates me, my sisters see me as a pathetic and talent-less loser, and my mom honestly cares more about what she is reading at the time then about what I do.  I cant blame them though; I don't do anything for them.  I cant even tell if I care about them or not.  I have so many secrets, and I don't tell them anything, much like my friends.  There are so many things they don't know about me, but if they knew...They would hate me.  That's the reason I hate myself so much.  There are just so many things...And I probably wont be able to tell anyone for a long time.  I cant.  But in doing so, its killing me inside.  It feels as though it is slowly eating away at me and its painful.  I don't do anything to stop it because I know I deserve it.  Sometimes I think that I create situations in which I will definitely experience some sort of physical or emotional pain.  The things I have done, the things I think, I deserve what I get.  Then I find myself complaining about it, and can only think one thing, hypocrite.  You do things to hurt others, and you cant even take pain.  I am just now coming to the realization that everything I tried to tell myself was all futile.  I am spineless, I am despicable, I am all of it.  And it all disgusts me.  My entire life disgusts me.  I hate it.  I cant help but wonder what the point is.  What am I going to be capable of doing in the future?  I cant think of anything, and those of you that think you know me and what I can do, forget it.  One thing I know is that I will always fall short of any goal I set for myself.  It has always happened and I don't see any reason for that to change.  I don't just want to become one of those people that doesn't contribute to society, that which I hate with a passion.  And most of all I don't want to be a hypocrite.  I cant hate those people and them become one of them.  I would rather die than do that.  But I feel that my life is inevitably leading to that.  I feel that I will never be able to free myself from that which makes me hold back.  I don't even know what it is.  Is it a fear of being different?  A fear of rejection?  Or maybe its the simple fact that if I were to break free, to show my true self, that something might be expected from me?  I honestly don't know, and I think my only goal in life would be to figure it out.  Of course, Id just fall short, naturally.  I honestly don't know.
