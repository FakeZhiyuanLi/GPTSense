      Ok so I got my new lucky magazine today gosh its about time!I really want to buy this yellow leather clutch! so cute, but that can wait=)  Not much going on here, today I am going to clean the rooms upstairs, that should keep me busy until tonight, I have to vacuum early though because the people here sleep early!I don't want to hear any complains about us. My aunt got home this morning vomiting, I think she really needs to get her esophagus dilated again, I don't think nexium is helping anymore =( she's kind of ok now she took some phenergan, it knocked her out!, hopefully she feels better soon.   I was supposed to go to Spartanburg yesterday, and hang out with some friends, this girl kimmy been calling me to see if I wanted to hang out, I'm just so not in the mood! I dont know why, I guess because there's really nothing to do in Spartanburg, and oh gosh constructions everywhere! very annoying, you have to change routes, too much of a hassle!  I'm not looking forward at all next semester, I cant stand the people in my class, so many haters!, I mean some are extremely nice the ones that are not from redneck towns, but the other ones omg! unbearable, prejudice people but what can I do? Ignorance!!!, they refused to look outside the box they think the world revolves around them, sad... I'm just gona go to class and get out, at least I don't have to socialized with these people to pass! whew, I just cant wait to graduate!!!, isn't that scary though, prejudice people going into nursing?

      Well so today I talked to my friend, just wanted to touch base. She said she's been busy with work at the hospital lucky girl!!!, I wish I'm doing something like that, so we were talking and she told me she had to bathe this 19 year old guy who had a jet ski accident, so in other words she saw his manhood hehehe,the guy was cute with this to die for body according to her, naughty naughty girl, yep these are the future nurses of america!. Well we're still not used to the idea of seeing a naked body, we're working on it, I'm still not comfortable asking personal questions about sexuality sometimes, like "do you still do it?" I have no choice I have to know these things=) it's fun though!. Well I'm planning of cleaning the rooms upstairs, but I cant get to stand up and go for some reason, I keep saying 5 more minutes next thing I know it's 8 already and I'm still here in front of the computer, procrastinator! well later, gotta burn some calories!

      Ok so I'm starting a new blog today, feels weird. So I've been in emotional rollercoaster for the past few months now, so many problems, so many issues that I need to solve but I'm just exhausted. Sometimes I just try to block everything, go to sleep for the whole entire day and hopefully when I wake up everything is normal again, yeah right, in my dreams!, my life will always be filled with dramas and there's nothing I can do about it. As if my life is not stressful enough I found out something, gosh it cuts like a knife!!!. Why is this happening to me?, I'm a good person I do believe I am, not perfect but I always put others before me, maybe that's the problem maybe this time around I have to think about ME first what I really want because most of these people don't even know I exist sometimes. My aunt is selling her house, sad very sad, despite of what is happening you would think that my other aunt would sympathized a little bit, but gosh no, she's more worried about the grandfather clock!!!, she wants to buy it see, she keeps saying horrible horrible things, people can be so cruel, regardless of their history, this is the time that family should come together and help each other out gosh!, no wonder my cousin put a restraining order on her, she cant seem to stay away from other people's business, she makes it her business, I'm having second thoughts about coming home, why?, lets just say I feel like I'm in this bubble when I'm up north, they want me to be isolated from the rest of the world, stay there until I'm thirty. They're always watching me like a hawk and I'm not just talking about my parents, my aunts!!!!!!! Parents I can understand, but my aunts??!!?? They wont budge, what is wrong with these people??? Not that I'm disrespecting them, but its really not right anymore. This is my life and I am taking charge. So then changing the subject the issue this week is "cheating", my friend who is about to leave for her training is worried that her boyfriend is gona cheat on her, she's in a dilemma of whether or not she should stay with him or not?, afterall why put herself in emotional agony, constant wondering of whether he is screwing someone or not, but you know what I learned this week?, I learned that you cant tell people what to do and what not to do, because chances are they'll still do it, this is something out of our hands, that's what conscience is for right?!?? I do believe that what goes around comes around, so why do something that can hunt you later on??? I used to be so scared of being alone, but you know what if being alone can bring me peace of mind then I would rather be alone, and for the other person they're not gona have that peace of mind knowing that they fucked up, so why shed tears??? We all have choices, there's no such thing as "it just happened" we let things happen, its just a matter of being brave enough to accept that we messed up and take the consequences of our actions, instead of blaming it on the situation. I think I have said enough for today....
