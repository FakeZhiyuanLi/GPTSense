      Im still a minor which means that when i get hired anywhere that i have to get a new work permit.  i dont see why i have to since i will be working for my school.  I woke up this morning and had 2 pepperoni pizza pockets.  one before i let out the chickens and one after i got back in the house.  it was a mess when we went to my school.  my coordinator told us that the permit would be all filled out and that all we had to do is take it to my doctor and then back to the school and we'd be done with it.  but it turned out that it wasnt even close to being filled out so we took it to my doctors and we have to take it back to the school tomarrow morning.  after my doctors visit i got an oreo cookie ice cream from the store and ate it as my under 250 calorie snack.  Then i talked with my dad and ate 2 hot dogs for dinner.  i ended up eating a reeses cup and some chips and dip after that.  i hope that i start exercising soon so that my clothes will start to fit again.

      Today i had two slices of pizza for breakfast.  i really love the food.  We went to town and on our way back we stopped at the lucky wok and i had an order of the chicken and broccoli which came with pork fried rice Yum! Then later on i ate 3 small slices of italian bread fresh from market basket.  Then for dinner i had 2 mamwiches.  They were somewhat filling.

      I had an ice cream bing today.  I had about 5 scoops total today.  I really need to get my bike fixed so that i can ride up to tipp. and talk with linda.  I love country music but its so sad to listen to when you are by yourself.  Everywhere you go people are in pairs.  I think that my mom might be right that im just too picky about my boyfriends. Its not that i cant attract one because im not a dog but im not a gorgeous supermodel lookalike.  I guess all im looking for is a guy that is honest.  Im looking into someone that lives close but i dont think that it would work out. But in reality who knows what relationships will work out and what ones will be destroyed.  I think that i just need to go back to school. It will be better then because i will have my secretary job to keep me busy. im really nervous though.  but i think this job i will do anything to keep.  what will be great is that i will be working next to the ymca.  i think im gonna get a membership there and work out after work then ride into tipp and continue to be a teenager.  my parents told me that i dont need a second job but it will feel so weird going to school for only two classes and then leaving for work.  But im gonna just write my total food garnishes for the day:  The ice cream, a pizza pocket, can of spagettios, and most of a chicken breast dinner from wendy's, i wouldnt count the salad because it was icky, after two bites i got sick.

      A few days ago i started taking the green tea diet pills.  Today is my third day taking them.  so far today i have eaten a turkey sandwich on white with tomato and eleven oreo cookies.  i am excited about losing weight but i still have the cravings i really like the green tea pills because they dont make you feel sick or anything.  but they do give you more energy.  i think i will fix my bike and maybe go for a mile ride to tipp. tomarrow.  my goal is to lose about ten pounds and tone up my body.  i dont care about the weight as much as the toning up.
