      It was about 5p.m. in the afternoon and I had received an sms from Justin,telling me that he had a surprise in store for me at the canteen.Wondering what it was,i rushed down after 2 long hours of G.P. When i reached the canteen,i sure got a little shock.Justin was sitting in front of her at a canteen bench..Yes her.. the girl ive been adoring for months and had yet to take any action on .. Justin rushed to me and said " Sze Wei, Now's ur chance." I was confused."What am i supposed to do,i have no idea what u are talking about."I asked. "I tell u what,u just go upstairs and come down from that stairs over there.Then when u walk past our table,just wave and say hello to us and at the same time her.."Justin Said. "Wah wait,wah kao, u never inform me earlier about this,im not mentally prepared"I said shockingly. "Never mind la Oi.. Just Do what i say,u dun wana lose this precious chance"Justin said before nudging me to go. "wah lao eh.. ok ok i go la"I said.With that, I rushed up to the 2nd level and began to walk down the stairs leading the the dessert stall. When i reached the base of the stairs and walked past their table, I waved and said hello to Xin Wee and Justin who waved back and said HI LOUDLY(Damn obvious they were up to something).But ALAS!!I walked past and didnt even give her eye contact or much less smile!!Omg .. i am the greatest wuss in the world... After that,Justin and Xin Wee came to me.. "SZe Wei!! What you doing,u blew everything up.. u didnt even look at her!.. See what u've done.. everything is gone!"Justin said. "Wah lao i dunno.. I really very nervous.My hands super cold and my heart almost exploded.."I said .. Xin wee tapped my arm and exclaimed."Wah!really very cold leh!" "wah lao see what u've done.. no more such golden opportunities already.."Justin said "wah lao.. i cant believe i didnt even look at her.. what was i doing.."I said  "aiya,nevermind la.. try another day,i have to go alreadi"Justin Said.. "Ok..i think i go too.."I said reluctantly. We walked down the stairs,through the side gate and to the bus stop.There,we saw Frankie and Justin told him everything about what had just happened. "HaHa.. Why u so hum one.. just say hi to a girl only what,why u so nervous"Frankie Said. "wah lao i dunno y also..ive never done anything like this in my life,i swear my heart almost exploded when i was less than 1 metre away from her."I replied. I then bade farewell to justin and went up the bridge with Frankie to the other side of the road. Each step i took made me think more about what had just happened..What was wrong with me..Why didnt i even look at her..smile at her..tok to her..I was very angry with myself..I had let Xin wee and Justin down..most importantly,i had let myself down. By then,i had reached the other side of the bridge.There,i paused and turned to Frankie. "Frankie...this cannot go on.. i think ill turn back or ill regret forever.."I said. "Haha good good ,we go back now"Said Frankie. When i returned to the bus stop,Justin saw me and was quite surprised. "Why are u back,what u gonna do?"he asked. "I think im gonna go back in again,im gonna try this one more time"I said. "okok..go for it,gd luck"Said Justin. With that,I started to walk back into the school compound..Past the track..Up some flight of stairs..And finally ,i reached the base of the main stairway leading to the canteen.It is now or never..It is now or never i muttered to myself..I musn't lose this chance i thought to myself. I started to climb the stairs.Each step i took seemed heavy and difficult,as though i was wading through resistant water(Seriously..No Melodrama intended here..) Finally..I reached the top of the stairs,and turned to look.. There she was..still sitting at the bench.. there it was.. my last opportunity to salvage the situation... (To Be Continued)
