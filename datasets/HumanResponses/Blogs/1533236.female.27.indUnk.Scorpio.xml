      I like finding shit. I like keeping the shit that I find. My newest obsession is found grocery receipts.  I just decided to collect them, at 1am while at the Walmart Neighborhood Market.  Does that make me odd?  Would it be more interesting to scan them in? Probably. But that's not the point.   #1  Walmart Neighborhood Market Broken Arrow, oK Self-check lane   Great Value Chicken Broth Great Value Chicken Broth Med Noodles Tampons (generic) Ramen Beef Ramen Beef Ramen Beef Gogurt St Bn Oreo  Total 9.91 Cash 20.00 change 10.09    someone is having their princess time..   I like that everything was off brand except for gogurt and Oreos. We have our priorities.

      Walmart Neighborhood Market Self Check Lane  6/17/04  18:19:01 (found 6/17, 9:30ish)   Folgers           3.86 Chicken Stir Fry  4.96 Chicken Stir Fry  4.96  Total 15.02 Cash 20.00  Change 4.98   ********  That seems awfully high for chicken stir fry, presumably frozen. I think they could have bought some chicken breasts and some vegetables for much less.  hmm.  I think they are single.  It would have been much more interesting if it had been instant coffee.  **********   This is a pretty boring hobby, really.

      The problem, of course with having such a collection is that new pieces are few and far between. I'm looking, just not finding.  sigh.

      Dear Sweet Zombie Jeebus, I'm going to be 27 tomorrow.  How the fuck did this happen?    Not that 27 is old. Far far far from it.  Really I don't think I mind being almost 30.  not really anyway.   I know many fine women who are in their 30s.    I just don't feel it.  Mentally I feel like a little kid, playing house. Is that weird?   I think maybe it is normal.   When I am around people, my age or a little older, I still feel like a little kid sitting w/ all the adults trying to understand their world.   no baby. no college degree. a suckass job.  rent house.  a month away from  bankruptcy.  This is not what my life was supposed to be.  Not at all.  I hope there are presents.

      I want my fucking wedding ring back.    I don't know why the fucking hotel maintenance worker chose to come into our room while we were at the beach. And I don't know why he chose to steal my ring.  I don't understand why I couldn't just take the risk of wearing it to the beach and I don't know why I didn't just leave it at home like my intuition told me to do. I don't know why I can't stop crying and I don't know when I'm going to feel better about this, if ever. I just know that if I ever come face to face with the man who did this, I will break his neck.  Some people might think I'm being overly dramatic about this. It's not as if anyone died.  And it could have been worse, certainly.  But I have lost something that was so so important to me. And even if I get it replaced, it won't be the same.  It won't be the ring that we picked out together when I was a newly engaged bride.  It won't be the ring that he slipped on my finger four years ago. It won't be at all the same.  I'm afraid it will always be just a ring.  I want the man to fry but I know he won't.  I want him to confess. I want him to see how stupid it was to use the key card that was registered to his name to come into our room.  I want him to return the ring.   It makes me sick to think of some skank wearing my ring.  Whether she belongs to the fuckass who did this or whether she got it at a pawn shop, I don't care.  I hate her.  Does she see the inscription? Or has it already been buffed away? Does she know that it will never be her ring?  Does she love it as much as I do?  Does she know what the man did to me? does she even care?

       Part of the problem of my giving the boards the big fuck you is that there is just so much stuff in my house to remind me of them. There is something in practically every room of my house to remind me of my old friends.

      I've spent the past few hours preparing a fine fine dinner.&nbsp;  I made:&nbsp; Boursin stuffed Chicken breasts (a tara specialty) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panzanella, featuring a variety of tomatoes from my garden &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Apple Carmelita (apples baked w/ crumb topping to be served w/ vanilla bean ice cream and topped w/ caramel sauce)  Plus I made key lime pie to use up the last of the key limes.&nbsp; But that won't be ready until tomorrow because I let it cook overnight in the fridge.   The funny thing is that Daniel is probably working until close so it will be probably midnight before we eat.&nbsp;&nbsp; And knowing him, he won't be hungry anyway.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Nothing is cooked yet, just ready to cook so it can always save until tomorrow.

      Four years ago today I stood in the winner's circle of a horse race track*&nbsp;between the 8th and 9th race to marry my best friend.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am oh so happy to be married to such a person as Daniel.&nbsp;&nbsp; He brought me Del Rancho for lunch even! (yes, the best chicken fried steak sandwich of OKC has finally come to Tulsa! Hurray!)  &nbsp;  &nbsp; *i have taken to saying horse race track now instead of just race track. Lest anyone think I got married at some nascar thing. heaven forbid.

      So I'm apparently far sighted.&nbsp; I have had glasses envy for a few years, thinking that glasses would look so cute on me. I was apparently right because 50 million pairs and a few tears later (I am a crybaby of the highest order), I have found the frames for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now just have to deal with the dizziness and headaches for two more weeks until they are ready.&nbsp; Crap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good news though, that my recent&nbsp;illness be attributed to my eyes rather than a mysterious tumor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, you know, a baby.  I don't know why I took the whole morning off.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;done w/ my appointment &nbsp;w/ plenty of time to still go to work.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I don't know that I mind.&nbsp;   I should go register for fall semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking two internet courses (can't be bothered w/ showing up to a classroom) and one saturday class.&nbsp; Finally back in school though I am worried since I haven't gone since 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eeek.

      I have been lightheaded, dizzy,&nbsp;nauseous and headachey for five days now.&nbsp; I have convinced myself that I'm either pregnant or have contracted some weird and fancy disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I realized I probably just need glasses.  &nbsp; Tomorrow I go to the doctor (yeah, on a Sunday. I'm odd like that).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      How could I possibly be depressed when we have booked our vacation?!&nbsp;&nbsp; From December 11-18 I will be on the Sea.&nbsp; It's not the S-S Norway, which is my idea of heaven, but it will do in a pinch.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The S-S Norway was for sale. Why doesn't anyone want to give us $28 million so we can buy it?  &nbsp;  So, we will be going to:&nbsp; Cozumel, Cancun,&nbsp;Belize City, and Bay Islands, Honduras.  &nbsp;  Yay!&nbsp; It has been too too long since I've gone snorkeling in the Caribbean.&nbsp; Maybe should buy our own gear instead of renting?  &nbsp;  **  &nbsp;  Tonight daniel got the idea to rearrange the living room.&nbsp; We have too much furniture for this to work out well.&nbsp;&nbsp; His original idea was to have the sofa sticking out in the middle of the room, effectively cutting the room in half.&nbsp; I'm sorry but no.&nbsp; It looks weird just plunked down in the middle of the room.&nbsp; And I am so bothered by sitting there and having half the living room and the rest of the house behind me. No. Just.. No.&nbsp;   So we've decided to stick the sofa against the other wall. This means I think that I'm not getting my loveseat.&nbsp; I don't think it will work w/ our new set up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bah.  &nbsp;  **  &nbsp;  I'm still not feeling well.&nbsp; Dizzy and short of breath and I can't seem to think clearly.&nbsp; Today I had the added bonus of nausea.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should go to the doctor but I don't want to. So there.  &nbsp;

       the first and last post about the message board thing I promise      I have been there for 3 years, have over 6000 posts, and was a moderator.  They should know me well enough to know that I am not a bitch.  I was raised w/ manners and class (a fuckload more than some of the girls on that board I can assure you)  so why do the girls that I considered friends for a long time now judge me as of poor breeding, with bad manners, etc.  In case you're wondering, it is all conveniently written in a half-assed internet advice column  urlLink here    Except not in great detail and not really very accurately.  She certainly wasn't the sole reason we went to visit that city. We went to see each other. The cookout was a "hey everyone's going to be in town, why don't yall come to my house for dinner" casual thing. Certainly not a party held in our honor.  And the level of dirtiness and crazy in Ms L is far far too much to detail.  You wouldn't believe me. Trust me. No one else did. But we could not have eaten in that house. Could not do it.  I have a big problem w/ potlucks and such in general. You just never know how clean someone's house is.  But to see something in person and then willingly eat there? No. Plus this girl seems a bit crazy.  I always read her website thinking she was hilarious, nutty in a fun way.  Everything taken separately is funny and just a tad weird.  Everything taken together and in real life is just too much.  So Jen, who I'm strongly suspecting is insane as well, was the first one to decide that we weren't going to the cookout.  But she is blaming me and another girl.  She has apparently been emailing anyone and everyone to tell her made up fantasy land version of what happened.  So everyone on the boards blames us, even maybe hates us.  So we've left the boards.  I didn't feel I had a choice.  Now a former stripper/heroin junkie and current cokehead/prelaw student has referred to us as the "two founding members of the sullen homely fat girl army"  Fat girl. ok. bitchy, but true.  Sullen? Homely? I don't fucking think so, bitch. And no one stepped up to defend us or to say hey that was harsh, etc.  No one.  I wish like hell I hadn't read that.  My natural curiosity (read: nosiness) got the better of me.  I really really wish I hadn't sent the link to the other girl that the post refers to.  I keep thinking about an old saying "the one who repeats an insult is insulting you"  And I don't want it to come across that way.  I don't want her to be hurting as much as I am hurting.  I read that last night and started crying. And somehow I didn't want to be alone in this horrible knowledge.  I'm selfish I guess.  So I'm sad. mourning the loss of the refuge that I've had for three years. Mourning the loss of good (well, I thought they were good) friendships.  Internet friendships true, but some of them I've talked to on the phone, or met in person.  Women that I thought I was happy to have in my life.  My husband says that what can I expect when a bunch of women get together? women are catty. Women are backstabby.  and I try not to believe that but am wondering. I've always been friends with men more than women. These were some of the best female friendships I've had in awhile.  I hate to lose that.  It's really really over though.  Before the fat girl army comment I thought that I could go back and post every once in awhile. but I can't do it.  I left junior high a long time ago and have no desire to go back.

      So I left work early today because I was dizzy and feeling like I was about to pass out.  Fun! There is at least one ambulance/fire truck call a week and I am not about to be the reason for the call this week.  I was feeling like this yesterday too.  So of course, everyone around my desk is now convinced that I am pregnant. I hope they shut the hell up about that very soon. Because I am not. I know I'm not. But if they keep mentioning it, I am going to start thinking I am and that's where I get into trouble.  I start to forget that I only have 3/4 of a poorly functioning left ovary and an empty spot where the right one is supposed to be.  Well. I assume it's an empty spot.  Unless a different organ decided to take up residence down there.  So I forget this fact and get my hopes up. But not this time. I promise.  I don't share these things w/ my coworkers of course.  I'm not one of those people.  Maybe I just hate my job.  I can't figure out why there are so many coworkers dropping dead or having asthma attacks or heart attacks, etc at their desks. Do my bosses only hire sickly people? Is our building cursed?    I never want to live in a house that doesn't have popsicles at all times in the summertime.  Bomb pops are preferred but I'll take those twin pops too.    I have said goodbye to an old internet crutch.  I'm not going to go into it here becasue my lord I think I have rehashed it enough.  It is enough to say though that I am happy, finally, after a few weeks of being down about it. And I think it was a long time coming.  So I'm back here at my old blog named after a weird Dolly Parton song.  Hurray for me!

      I really like my glasses.  I can actually see things!  I didn't realize how blind I was.  Plus, no more headaches and dizziness. And no more coworkers suggesting that I might be pregnant.  Plus, I must say it.  I look fucking cute in glasses.  I have decided that my declining eye sight is not an indication that I am getting older.  Damnit.  I have also decided to skip my Cruise ship facial this year and instead have a hydrotherapy bath! Someone remind me in December when it comes time to book my appointment in the spa.   urlLink http://www.ncl.com/more/spa_menu1.htm#bath_glory   It sounds much nicer.   I also just realized it's cheaper!  I paid $117 plus tip for my facial last time.  Ok that's settled.   Why am I deciding on this four months in advance?  Because my job sucks and I have to have something to think about when getting yelled at by new yorkers.
