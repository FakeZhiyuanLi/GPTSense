      This is the second week of sch....  Stress manz....there's soo much to do ... n there nvr seem to b enough time n energy to do them....i end up delaying them when i intended to complete them....haiz...  Then, haiz....  In my previous blog entry, i wrote about wat happened on sat right?? .... Well, i caught up with Adam yesterday...he told me that my manager was puzzled about my absence on Sun...n that he wanted to talk with the assisstant manager abt it...is that gd or bad?? Well,i dun care so much abt it...so...heck care!!  And also i heard from Adam that the two old witches had been called into the office to have a meeting with the manager n Ms R...it seems one of the old witches,the younger one came out in tears...or rather she looked as though shes abt to cry...haha, they got feelings meh?? if they do...its a miracle!! lolzzz....  Now, this is wat s been on my mind these few days...:  now, ppl....ive to apologise...it might seem irritating to some that i seem to write nothing but abt HIM...Theres no one i can really talk to...no one seems to truly understand....this the only place i can write my thoughts etc...n perhaps...think of ways to make my life easier...  I havent seen him ever since the 7th...although i just chatted with him on the 9th...  Although i chatted with him, it still doesnt beat seeing him in person...n talking face - to - face...I miss him....i cant get used it...i mean not seeing him everyday...n hearing his voice....etc...  n I messaged him a few times during past few days...but i got no response from him...Haiz... NO IDEA WATs GOING ON....I really wish i knew...  Then....remember i wrote abt Ms R liking the guy i like??  Now heres wat has been happening in a nutshell...:   She liked this guy 10 yrs older than her... Shes 22 i think...N whenever theres anything shes upset abt or happy abt with regards to the guy she has a crush on... I was always there...Hey, this guy doesnt know abt her crush on him...now changing target to the guy i like...  To me, i would nvr joke abt snatching someone away from my fren...I would nvr dream of even saying that...and needless to say flirt with the guys my frens like...  In short....she intends to snatch him away from me...

      Haiz....  I didnt turn up for work today....there are a few reasons for me doing so...  1) I havent completed my homework...n reading up of my lectures...  2) My Mum dont think i can cope with everything- meaning; my sch work n working life...n wanted me to rest well b4 the coming week....(first week of sch was kind of tiring for me)   3) The duty supervisor... (i d rather not mention her name...lets call her R)...She s a useless supervisor i must say...As u all know...ive been bullied v badly by two old witches, she has nvr told them off or anything neither has she showed any signs of standing by me...she knows very well whos in the wrong n whos in the right...n all she does is to try to please them...What the heck manz...!!   Just the other time...last week rather...last Saturday to b exact...One of the old witches...the older one kept picking on me...i tried v hard to control my anger ...Ive nvr showed my temper till that day...I really wanted to blast her off...but wat held me back was that I didnt want my fren...the supervisor to b in a spot,n i witheld my "blow up".... My fren didnt try to calm me down watsoever...instead she kept showing the "caught in the middle " kind of look...it really made me angry...n not just that, when the old witches told her rubbish abt me...she didnt defend me...n she even agreed to please them... Wat happened was that for the first time in my working there...I slammed things ...cos i couldnt scold them, neither could i "throw" things in their face to shut them up...guess thats the only way i could have retaliated back...The old foxy hag of a witch tried to come as close as possible to accuse me of hurting her when i slammed things, that was wat happened to my fren...haha, i wasnt so silly manz...when i slammed things, and she came near i siamed straight away...  I thought if this kind of lem bei supervisor dont do anything , then wats the point of me working there....Even i tried v hard to control my temper...she still gave me that kind of look n try so hard to please them... Wat if i blew up?....wouldnt the situation b worse?? N perhaps,who knows i might lose a fren in the process....  I really wonder y nobody said anything or told these witches off!! No one can stand them...heard they quarreled a few times with other collegues...  So...the whole day, i tried studying...but couldnt study much as i didnt understand much of the lectures...  Then, my collegue cum fren Yin Xin called me...n asked if i wanted to join her to buy a bag for sch purposes....as i needed one too...i joined her...n subsequently we met up with Adam...another fren...He told me that R was fed up with me...  Haiz....guess another "war" is brewing in the process.....  She, Miss R is also interested in Mr L....the guy i like....  Guess she has some kind of an excuse to complain abt me...not being cooperative etc...

      Nobody pays  Much attention  They misuse their time  Maybe it’s better to mention  Moments passing by   A secret to tell  I got something  They don't have  And baby it's you that  Is lifting me high   I just wanna be close to you  'Cos I understand  The strength of your hand  Oh and love that you  Put me through  You're more than a friend  So love me again   Baby you're full of affection  People stop and smile  Maybe they see my intention  To make life worthwhile   A secret to tell  Now there's nothing  Holding back  'Cos baby it's you that  Is making me fly   I just wanna be close to you  'Cos I understand  The strength of your hand  Oh and love that you  Put me through  You're more than a friend  So love me again   I just wanna be close to you  'Cos I understand  The strength of your hand  Oh and love that you  Put me through  You're more than a friend   A secret to tell  Now there's nothing  Holding back  'Cos baby it's you that  Is making me fly   Oh baby oh yeah  Love that you put me through  Love that you put me through

      I'm not looking for someone to talk to  I've got my friend, I'm more than O.K.  I've got more than a girl could wish for  I live my dreams but it's not all they say  Still I believe (I'm missing) I'm missing something real  I need someone who really sees me...   (Don't wanna wake...) Don't wanna wake up alone anymore  Still believing you'll walk through my door  All I need is to know it's for sure  Then I'll give... all the love in the world   I've often wondered if love's an illusion  Just to get you through the loneliest days  I can't criticize it  I have no hestitaion  My imagination just stole me away  (Still...) Still I believe  (I'm missing) I'm missing something real  I need someone who really sees me...   (Don't wanna wake...) Don't wanna wake up alone anymore  Still believing you'll walk through my door  All I need is to know it's for sure  Then I'll give... all the love in the world   Love's for a lifetime not for a moment  So how could I throw it away  Yeah I'm only human  And nights grow colder  With no-one to love me that way  Yeah I need someone who really sees me...   (Don't wanna wake...) And i won't wake up alone anymore  Still believing you'll walk through my door  You'll reach for me and I'll know it's for sure  Then I'll give all the love in the world  (Don't wanna wake up alone anymore...)

      Late at night, when all the world is sleeping  I stay up and think of you  And I wish on a star that, somewhere, you are  Thinking of me, too   'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight  'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight  And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be  Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me   Wonder if you ever see me, and I  Wonder if you know I'm there  If you looked in my eyes, would you see what's inside?  Would you even care?   I just wanna hold you close; but, so far  All I have are dreams of you  So I wait for the day and the courage to say  How much I love you  Yes, I do   I'll be dreaming of you tonight  'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight  And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be  Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me   Ah, ah  (Corazón)  I can't stop dreaming of you  (No puedo dejar de pensar en ti)  I can't stop dreaming  (Cómo te necesito)  I can't stop dreaming of you  (Mi amor, cómo te extraño)   Late at night, when all the world is sleeping  I stay up and think of you  And I still can't believe that you came up to me  And said, "I love you."  I love you, too   Now, I'm dreaming with you tonight  'Til tomorrow and for all of my life  And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be  Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly   Dreaming with you tonight  (With you tonight)  'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight  And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be  (Rather be)  Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly    Dreaming  (Of you tonight)  Endlessly  (And I'll be holding you tight tonight)  Dreaming  (Dreaming)  Endlessly  (With you tonight)   Endlessly  Endlessly  Dreaming

      In a time  Where the sun descends alone  I ran a long, long way from home  To find a heart, that's made of stone  I will try, I just need a little time  To get your face right out of my mind  To see the world through different eyes   (Chorus)  Every time I see you  Oh I try to hide away  But when we meet it seems I can't let go  Every time you leave the room  I feel I'm fading like a flower   Tell me why?  When I scream there's no reply  When I reach out there's nothing to find  When I sleep, I break down and cry   (Repeat Chorus)   Fading like a rose, fading like a rose  Beaten by the storm  Talking to myself, getting washed by the rain  It's such a cold, cold town  Oh, it's such a cold town   (Repeat Chorus 2X)

      Ocean's apart  Day after day  And I slowly go insane  I hear your voice  On the line  But it doesn't start the pain  If I see you next to never  How can we say forever?   (Chorus)  Wherever you go  Whatever you do  I will be right here waiting for you  Whatever it takes  Oh, how my heart breaks  I will be right here waiting for you   I took for granted  All the times  That I thought it would last somehow  I hear the laughter  I tasted the tears  But I can't get near you now   Oh, can't you see it baby?  You've got me going crazy   I wonder how  We can survive  This romance  But in the end if I'm with you  I'll take the chance   Oh, can't you see it baby?  You've got me going crazy   (Repeat Chorus)

      What a girl wants, what a girl needs  What a girl wants, what a girl needs  Yeah, c'mon   I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe  Like a rock, you waited so patiently  While I got it together  While I figured it out  I only looked, but I never touched  'Cause in my heart was a picture of us  Holding hands, making plans  And it's lucky for me you understand   (Chorus:)  What a girl wants, what a girl needs  Whatever makes me happy sets you free  And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly  What a girl wants, what a girl needs  Whatever keeps me in your arms  And I'm thanking you for giving it to me   What I want is what you got  And what you got is what I want   There was a time I was blind, I was so confused  Ran away just to hide it all from you  But, baby, you knew me better  Than I knew myself  They say if you love something, let it go  If it comes back, it's yours; that's how you know  It's for keeps; yeah, it's for sure  And you're ready and willing to give me more  Than...   (Repeat chorus)   (Bridge:)  What a girl wants, what a girl needs  Somebody sensitive, courageous, sexy, cool--like you  What a girl wants, what a girl needs  What you got is what I want  What a girl wants, what a girl needs  It's all right, it's okay  You let a girl know how much you care about her  I swear you're the one who always knew   You knew, you knew, you knew  Ooh, oh, I'm thanking you for being there for me  What a girl wants, what a girl needs  Whatever keeps me in your arms  (Whatever keeps me in your arms is what I need)   (Repeat chorus, ad lib, and fade)

      Oh...  I feel like I've been locked up tight  For a century of lonely nights  Waiting for someone  To release me   You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way  But that dont mean I'm gonna give it away  Baby, baby, baby  (baby, baby, baby)   Oh whoa...

      No Mountains too high, for you to climb  All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah  No rivers too wide, for you to make it across  All you have to do is believe it when you pray   And then you will see, the morning will come  And everyday will be bright as the sun  All of your fears cast them on me  I just want you to see...   I'll be your cloud up in the sky  I'll be your shoulder when you cry  I'll hear your voices when you call me  I am your angel  And when all hope is gone, I'm here  No matter how far you are, I'm near  It makes no difference who you are  I am your angel  I'm your angel   I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry  All you need is time, seek me and you shall find  You have everything and you're still lonely  It doesn't have to be this way, let me show you a better day   And then you will see, the morning will come  And all of your days will be bright as the sun  So all of your fears, just cast them on me  How can I make you see...   I'll be your cloud up in the sky  I'll be your shoulder when you cry  I'll hear your voices when you call me  I am your angel  And when all hope is gone, I'm here  No matter how far you are, I'm near  It makes no difference who you are  I am your angel  I'm your angel   And when it's time to face the storm  I'll be right by your side  Grace will keep up safe and warm  And I know we will survive   And when it seems as if your end is drawing near  Don't you dare give up the fight  Just put your trust beyond the sky...   I'll be your cloud up in the sky  I'll be your shoulder when you cry  I'll hear your voices when you call me  I am your angel  And when all hope is gone, I'm here  No matter how far you are, I'm near  It makes no difference who you are  I am your angel  I'm your angel   I'll be your cloud up in the sky  I'll be your shoulder when you cry  I'll hear your voices when you call me  I am your angel  And when all hope is gone, I'm here  No matter how far you are, I'm near  It makes no difference who you are  I am your angel  I'm your angel

      For all those times you stood by me  For all the truth that you made me see  For all the joy you brought to my life  For all the wrong that you made right  For every dream you made come true  For all the love I found in you  I'll be forever thankful baby  You're the one who held me up  Never let me fall  You're the one who saw me through through it all   You were my strength when I was weak  You were my voice when I couldn't speak  You were my eyes when I couldn't see  You saw the best there was in me  Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  You gave me faith 'coz you believed  I'm everything I am  Because you loved me   You gave me wings and made me fly  You touched my hand I could touch the sky  I lost my faith, you gave it back to me  You said no star was out of reach  You stood by me and I stood tall  I had your love I had it all  I'm grateful for each day you gave me  Maybe I don't know that much  But I know this much is true  I was blessed because I was loved by you   You were my strength when I was weak  You were my voice when I couldn't speak  You were my eyes when I couldn't see  You saw the best there was in me  Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  You gave me faith 'coz you believed  I'm everything I am  Because you loved me   You were always there for me  The tender wind that carried me  A light in the dark shining your love into my life  You've been my inspiration  Through the lies you were the truth  My world is a better place because of you   You were my strength when I was weak  You were my voice when I couldn't speak  You were my eyes when I couldn't see  You saw the best there was in me  Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  You gave me faith 'coz you believed  I'm everything I am  Because you loved me   (bis)  I'm everything I am  Because you loved me

      Oh, oh  How to get me hooked on you  I like that   Honey you can have me  When you want me  If you simply ask me to be there  And you’re the only one who  Makes me come running  Cause what you got is far  Beyond compare   And it’s just like honey  When your love comes over me  Oh baby I’ve got a dependency  Always strung out for another  Taste of your honey   It’s like honey when it washes over me  You know sugar never ever was so sweet  And I’m dying for ya crying for ya I adore ya  One hit of your love addicted me  Now I’m strung out on you darling  Don’t you see every night and day  I can hardly wait for another taste of honey   Honey I can’t describe  How good it feels inside  Honey I can’t describe  How good it feels inside   I can’t be elusive  With you honey  Because it’s blatant  That I’m feeling you  And it’s so hard for me  To leave abruptly  Cause you’re the only thing  I wanna do   And it’s just like honey  When your love comes over me  Oh baby I’ve got a dependency  Always strung out for another  Taste of your honey   It’s like honey when it washes over me  You know sugar never ever was so sweet  And I’m dying for ya crying for ya I adore ya  One hit of your love addicted me  Now I’m strung out on you darling  Don’t you see every night and day  I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

      I don't need your sympathy There's nothing you can say or do for me And I don't want a miracle You'll never change for no one And I hear your reasons why Where did you sleep last night? And was she worth it, was she worth it?  Chorus:  I'm strong enough to live without you Strong enough and I quit crying Long enough now I'm strong enough To know you gotta go  Chorus 2:  There's no more to say So save your breath and walk away No matter what I hear you say I'm strong enough to know you gotta go  So you feel misunderstood Baby have I got news for you On being used, I could write the book But you don't wanna hear about it  'Cause I've been losing sleep And you've been going cheap And she ain't worth half of me it's true I'm telling you, that  (chorus)  Come hell or waters high You'll never see me cry This is our last goodbye, it's true I'm telling you, now  (chorus) (chorus 2)  (chorus) (chorus 2)

      When you walk by every night  Talking sweet and looking fine  I get kind of hectic inside  Baby, I’m so into you  Darling, if you only knew  All the things that flow through my mind  But it’s just a   Sweet, sweet fantasy baby  When I close my eyes  You come and you take me  On and on and on  It’s so deep in my daydreams  But it’s just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby   Images of rapture  Creep into me slowly  As you’re going to my head  And my heart beats faster  When you take me over   Time and time and time again  But it’s just a   Sweet, sweet fantasy baby  When I close my eyes  You come and you take me  On and on and on  It’s so deep in my daydreams  But it’s just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby   I’m in heaven  With my boyfriend  My laughing boyfriend  There’s no beginning and there is no end  Feels like I’m dreaming but I’m not sleeping   It’s just a Sweet, sweet fantasy baby  When I close my eyes  You come and you take me  On and on and on  It’s so deep in my daydreams  But it’s just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

      I've been standing out in the rain I've been calling your name Got that lonely feeling again  Do you hear me? Do you want me?  Chorus:  Baby it's all or nothing now Don't wanna run and I can't walk out You're breaking my heart if you leave me now Don't wanna wait forever Who do you think you're fooling? Who do you think you're fooling? Baby it's all or nothing Baby it's all or nothing now  I've been trying to get to your heart But I'm chasing shadows We keep falling further apart So near and you're so far  Do you care now? Do you know how?  (chorus)  Sometimes, when you touch me I just can't help myself [Can't help myself] Desire makes me weak Desire makes me weak  Do you care now? Do you know how?  Baby it's all or nothing I don't wanna run and I can't walk out You're breaking my heart if you leave me Don't wanna wait forever  (chorus)  Now

      How can I just let you walk away,  just let you leave without a trace  When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh  You're the only one who really knew me at all   How can you just walk away from me,  when all I can do is watch you leave  'cause we've shared the laughter and the pain  and even shared the tears  You're the only one who really knew me at all   So take a look at me now,  oh there's just an empty space  And there's nothing left here to remind me,  just the memory of your face  Ooh take a look at me now,  well there's just an empty space  And you coming back to me is against all odds  and that's what I've got to face   I wish I could just make you turn around,  turn around and see me cry  There's so much I need to say to you,  so many reasons why  You're the only one who really knew me at all   So take a look at me now,  well there's just an empty space  And there's nothing left here to remind me,  just the memory of your face  Now take a look at me now,  'cause there's just an empty space  But to wait for you, is all I can do  and that's what I've got to face   Take a good look at me now,  cos I'll still be standing here  And you coming back to me is against all odds  It's the chance I've gotta take   Take a look at me now

      Well, here we are again;  I guess it must be fate.  We've tried it on our own,  But deep inside we've known  We'd be back to set things straight.   I still remember when  Your kiss was so brand new.  Every memory repeats,  Every step I take retreats,  Every journey always brings me back to you.   CHORUS After All the stops and starts,  We keep coming back to these two hearts,  Two angels who've been rescued from the fall.  After All that we've been through,  It all comes down to me and you.  I guess it's meant to be,  Forever you and me, After All.   When love is truly right  (This time it's truly right.)  It lives from year to year.  It changes as it goes,  Oh, and on the way it grows,  But it never disappears,   CHORUS   Always just beyond my touch,  You know I needed you so much.  After All, what else is livin' for?  CHORUS

Wouldn’t you agree, baby you and me,  we’ve got a groovy kind of love...?  Anytime you want to, you can turn me on to  Anything you want to, anytime at all.  When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver  Can’t control the grivering inside...  Wouldn’t you agree, baby you and me,  we’ve got a groovy kind of love...?  When I’m feeling blue, all I have to do  Is take a look at you, then I’m not so blue  When I’m in your arms, nothing seems to matter  My whole world could shatter, I don’t care...

      I would give up everything  Before I'd separate myself from you  After so much suffering  I've finally found a man that's true  I was all by myself for the longest time  So cold inside  And the hurt from the heart it would not subside  I felt like dying  Until you saved my life   Thank God I found you  I was lost without you  My every wish and every dream  Somehow became reality  When you brought the sunlight  Completed my whole life  I'm overwhelmed with gratitude  'Cause baby I'm so thankful  I found you   I would give you everything  There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do  To ensure your happiness  I'll cherish every part of you  Because without you beside me I can't survive  I don't wanna try  If you're keeping me warm each and every night  I'll be all right  'Cause I need you in my life   Thank God I found you (I'm begging you)  I was lost without you (so lost without you)  My every wish and every dream (every dream, every dream)  Somehow became reality  When you brought the sunlight (brought the sunlight) Completed my whole life  I'm overwhelmed with gratitude  'Cause baby I'm so thankful  I found you   See I was so desolate  Before you came to me  Looking back I guess it shows  That we were destined to shine  After the rain to appreciate  And care for what we have  And I'd go through it all over again  To be able to feel this way   Thank God I found you  I was lost without you (lost without you baby)  My every wish and every dream  Somehow became reality  When you brought the sunlight  Completed my whole life (whole life)  I'm overwhelmed with gratitude  Sweet baby I'm so thankful  I found you   Thank God I found you  I was lost without you  I'm overwhelmed with gratitude  My baby I'm so thankful  I found you   I'm overwhelmed with gratitude  My baby I'm so thankful I found you

      When I'm lost in the rain, In your eyes I know I'll find the light to light my way. And when I'm scared and losing ground; When my world is going crazy, You can turn it all around.  And when I'm down you're there; pushing me to the top. You're always there; giving me all you've got.  CHORUS  For a shield from the storm; For a friend; for a love To keep me safe and warm, I turn to you. For the strength to be strong; For the will to carry on; For everything you do; For everything that's true, I turn to you.  When I lose the will to win, I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again. I can do anything, 'Cause your love is so amazing; 'cause your love inspires me. (Yes it does)  And when I need a friend, you're always on my side; Giving me faith that gets me through the night.  CHORUS  For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain; For truth that will never change; For someone to lean on; for a heart I can rely on through anything; (you can rely on me) For that one who I can run to.... I turn to you.  CHORUS   I turn to you...

      No New Year's Day to celebrate, No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away,  No first of spring, no song to sing,  In fact, here's just another ordinary day.   CHORUS I just called to say I love you; I just called to say how much I care;  I just called to say I love you,  And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  No April rain, no flowers' bloom,  No wedding Saturday within the month of June.  But what it is is something true  Made up of these three words that I must say to you.   CHORUS   No summer's high, no warm July,  No harvest moon to light one tender August night,  No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,  Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.   CHORUS  No Libra sun, no Hallowe'en,  No giving thanks for all the Christmas joy you bring,  But what it is, tho' old, so new,  To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.   CHORUS

      You know everything I'm afraid of You do everything I wish I did Everybody wants you, everybody loves you I know I should tell you how I feel And I wish everyone would disappear Everytime you call me, I'm too scared to be me And I'm too shy to be me  Chorus: Ooh, I got a crush on you (crush on you) I hope you feel the way that I do I get a rush when I'm with you Ooh, I've got a crush on you (crush on you)  You know I'm the one you can talk to And sometimes you tell me things that I don't want to know I just want to hold you And you say exactly how you feel about her And I wonder, could you ever think of me that way  Chorus  Ooh, I wish I could tell somebody But there's no one to talk to Nobody knows I've got a crush on you A crush on you, I got a crush You say everything that no one says But I feel everything you're afraid to feel I will always want you, I will always love you  Chorus

      I used to call you my girl  I used to call you my friend  I used to call you the love  The love that I never had   When I think of you  I don't know what to do  When will I see you again   I miss you like crazy  Even more than words can say  I miss you like crazy  Every minute of every day  Girl I'm so down  When your love's not around  I miss you, miss you, miss you  I miss you like crazy   You are all that I want  You're all that I need  Can't you see how I feel  Can't you see that my pain's so real   When I think of you  I don't know what to do  When will I see you again   I miss you like crazy  Even more than words can say  I miss you like crazy  Every minute of every day  Girl I'm so down  When your love's not around  I miss you, miss you, miss you  I miss you like crazy

      Don't go changing, to try and please me  You never let me down before  Don't imagine you're too familiar  And I don't see you anymore  I wouldn't leave you in times of trouble  We never could have come this far  I took the good times, I'll take the bad times  I'll take you just the way you are   Don't go trying some new fashion  Don't change the color of your hair  You always have my unspoken passion  Although I might not seem to care   I don't want clever conversation  I never want to work that hard  I just want someone that I can talk to  I want you just the way you are.   I need to know that you will always be  The same old someone that I knew  What will it take 'till you believe in me  The way that I believe in you.   I said I love you, and that's forever  And this I promise from the heart  I could not love you any better  I love you just the way you are.

      I dunno y... whenever Im bullied by the old hags...they dun really bother him as long as he's there...   Many girls like him... the latest one i heard abt was yesterday... Tang said that he tried to date Yuet Lin an ex-collegue...n her response was to ask Tang to bring Mr L along...Tang said that she seems interested in him... =  Besides people at my workplace being attracted to him...  there are customers... regardless of age would flirt with him...Haiz...  And u know something?? There ARE married aunties interested in him leh...They knew abt my crush on him n r v hostile towards me...  Im feeling more worried that...due to the shortage of manpower, they might employ more people...Im ok with that, but Im scared that...pretty gals around his age would come along....and he would kind of "forget " me?? Or worse still, he might think that I would probably have gotten to know some guys in my sch n forget him ...n he ll just give up on me if i didnt keep in touch with him??  At the moment, things seem to b going smooth if i can say that... but how long will this last?? guess it wont b long b4 he forgets abt this childish, immature little gal bah.....  Im really v worried...   Oh ya...I forgot to update abt wat happened on the 1st...  I had Mac for dinner...n he noticed it n said ae, these few days u ve been eating Mac not sian meh??  Then as usual, i offered him my fries...n suggested that dipping fries in curry sauce was great... he tried it soon aft i suggested it..  then i noticed that he didnt eat it with the sauce after the first try...so i asked him if it was because he didnt like it...n his response was cute!!! he said...no, I like it!!!  Rallen he came up to me during work...and asked me weird questions ...Y do i like Mr L...etc...N also said things like I ll definitely find guys who r much better than him in poly...n told me not to give up the whole forest just because of one tree...n told me that i should also give other guys a chance...  The whole time he was talking to me abt that... I cant help but think...Hey brother! Y r u telling me all this??   N theres something i noticed... The gal- friends i have who knows abt it ...gave no comments abt the age thing...but its the guys who keep discourging me abt the age stuff n things like i should give others a chance etc...blah , blah , blah....  Haiz...  Feeling v sick n tired hearing all those "kind-hearted" words...  N theres more to that... I felt kind of good when i gave Tang a piece of my mind yesterday...  He n cch were talking abt computer games..n so happened that they were talking abt Red Alert or command and conqeuer i cant remember...but i chaipped in saying that i know how to play those games too!...then Tang went on saying that Oh, those r v old games...n he pissed me off when he said u play old games, no wonder u like old man...  Damn ! I really got kind of pissed off when that comment came out of his mouth...  At first, i didnt want to rebutt him...but when he carried on saying that, y u like Mr L ...hes a n old man, old enuf to b ur father...  Gosh, i got relly mad at it...  I began saying   Hey, i dun think there s any 12 yr old father...n hey, i like him...it's I who like him, not u...n i dun think i asked u for ur comments...Thank you...but i didnt ask for them...so pls keep them to urself thank u...  He was dumbfounded when i finished speaking...  felt great manz...  I just hope he ll stop giving me his nonsensical comments n i ll b v grateful...  It was just yesterday i saw him...n i'm beginning to miss him...I sound crazy manz...

      2/06/04.... Started work at 2pm... I wasn't suppose to work today...but because Rallen couldnt make it,i had to stand in...guess ive to thank Rallen ...cos i get to c him one more day...  I dunno y... at the start of the day at work, i didnt want to talk to him...mayb because i thought he didnt like me or watever... but somehow, i kind of "melted" the moment he spoke to me...  Actually, the reason i didnt want to speak to him was that i msged him last nite...i asked him...  Wat type of gals do u like? Do age matter to you??  Huh? Why ask me this?  Erm...just asking...juz pretend ive nvr asked...  U wanna matchmake me issit?  No,I just wanted to know...  I see...Gd nite!  I dunno, but after those msgs i thought, either he was trying to b kind...perhaps the kind of gals he like was totally diff from me...or...he just wanted to show that he didnt like me?? I just got v sensitive....n somehow, i felt v stupid ...n tears kind of rolled down my face ...I dunno, i find that ever since ive got this crush on him...I ve became v v sensitive to the things he says n do....n guess im getting paranoid???  When i went to work today, i didnt say hi to him like wat i usually do...n walked past him like i didnt notice his presence...  I somehow couldnt remain "stone" to him, the moment he spoke to me, i instaneously forgot wat i was upset abt...strange isnt it??   As my collegue Tang, was sick n tired of repeating wat he does everyday ...asked me to help him top-up the drinks in the fridge,as i had nothing to do...i just helped him along...  Then, Mr L...was clearing some tables, walked past me n said, ae, y recently whenever u come, i always c u topping up drinks?? I was thinking, hey, u noticed my silly movements...=P  Then, he was busy talking to one of the cutomers... they were steated infront of the sandwhich bar...I was bz cleaning up things for the sandwhich bar...n guess wat, he kept looking at wat i was doing...n had a smile on his face when i was joking around with my collegues.... ^.^  Then, He had to go to the market place to do I.B.T...er...it is shopping for cafe use...like marketing...I was playing n joking with my fren Rien, then, i kind of "scream" cos, my fren joked abt snatching him from me...He was quite faraway, n guess wat?? my fren saw him looking at me v concerned .... then my fren said hes so in-tune to ur voice eh??...one little scream from u, he looks at u immediately...^.^  Then when he was back from the supermarket, he signaled me to help him unpack the items he had in the trolley...then, there was this carton of milk he asked me to place in the fridge in the kitchen...as i didnt have enuf strength, i opened the box to take them out one by one...but then he said y not take the whole carton to the back?? I said, er i dun have enuf strangth to do that... upon hearing that, I tried to carry the box to the back...then , he expressed concern by asking me if i can manage... but before i could answer, he took the boxfrom me and unloaded the box himself.... ^.^   N then, when he had to get things done...he would call my name n ask me to help him... even though theres others around who r free...like today, there was a pick-up order from a customer which required one person to wait at the taxi stand for the lady to pass by n pass it to her.... I was quite surprised when he called my name to do that task...as there were others collegues who were idle near him...   Then, he had to clear cum arrange certain things ... and guess wat ? he asked me to help...it was rather strange as wat he wanted me to help didnt require two people to do it...i was washing dishes when he called my name...he signaled me over, then he asked me to pass the glasses in the box to him , one by one... It was kind of cool doing things with him...he sat on one box n me squating near another passing him those glasses while he commented on the cupboard n the glasses... Then, after helping him ... Tang said...so had a nice time helping him??  Then, it was time to have my break...i went for my break soon after Rien told me to go, but i didnt tell him.... After i came back from buying my dinner at the Mac...I went straight to the office to have my meal there... N guess wat manz...He came in,n looked kind of "surprise" to c me there... I dunno, but had this feeling that his look of surprise was made up...Then, he began arranging the schedule ... And he was so cute when i offered him fries...he said Ofcourse,i want...so cute...  Then, i was dipping the fries in the curry sauce...then, he said, ae, the curry sauce is for the nuggets right? Then, following that...he dipped the fries in it...the way he did it was so cute!! ^.^  while i was having my meal, he went on saying that he wun b doing nite shift until 25th... :  my blog entry so long sia today... ;P

He was on morning shift... n so, i managed to c him...heez.... whenever he ask me to do things...n when i reply with a "orh" he ll always have a slight smile on his face...hehe like to c him smile...  Then, Im kind of dead yesterday, i blurted something i shouldnt have said...when i saw the july schedule..i was curious, as i saw that he seldom worked on weekends...so, i asked him...ae, u seldom work on weekends in july liao ar?? then, his response was that actually hes not suppose to take any shifts but because theres only two supervisors, he has no choice but to take them if one of them aint free...Then, he said he works on Sundays though...then...after a slight pause of silence on both sides...I blurted out...huh? so, that means after Thursday, the next time i c u will only b on 17th ar??  ( that means...after Thursday working nite shift with him...it would b my last same shift with him before i get to c him again , cos sch's starting for me...n im going to work only on weekends)   Then before he left for home...he walked past me at the sandwhich bar, n chit-chatted with me for a while...  30th...today....with him!!! yea...^-^  I was suppose to start work at 4pm today and was there v early today...n guess wat?? the moment he saw me...he said, ae, ure here so early ar?? heez, he noticed wat time im supposed to cum...  Guess wat i heard from my fren today...aiyo, so pai seh sia... An aunty at my workplace...her name's Julie...asked my fren Rien who would b working today during nite shift...n my fren listed a few names e.g Mr. L ( hehe, let's call HIM that k??) ...Noraini...Azlina...Then, Aunty Julie said where's L's girlfiend??   When i heard it from my fren, i was thinking...eh...he n i havent reach that stage leh...girlfiend?? pai seh manz...  some of the more elderly ppl would refer to me as his girlfriend...when im not around... then, some younger frens of mine would tease me saying ur husband leh??   more n more ppl r teasing me abt him...  another collegue Tang...said Ur L's outside leh...sure can handle...when i asked him to help out with the customers at the sandwhich bar...

      HAiz....  Guess wat I'm most afraid of is going to happen le....  Heard from one of the old witches that he's gonna leave....wat i man here is that he's resigning....  I dunno y but the moment i heard abt it .... i almost ended up in tears.... I curbed myself....but tears just kept welling up.... When i asked Tang abt it.... the qns that poped out of hes mouth was that y are u so concerned if hes leaving not?  Then the next thing i knew was that i saw him confronting the old witch as to y she told me abt it...the reason she gave was that it was better th sooner i knew the better.  Haiz....  that time when i knew abt it was on Sun.... till now i m still not over the shock somehow...  SO SAD!!  I asked him abt it.... is it true that ure leaving on the 18th? I got so down n disappointed that i kind of threw myself into nothing but work.... n refused to look or talk to him for a few hours...  And know wat?? he seemed to understand n let me work out my frustration...  Then when he asked me over to sign for the cashier stuff.... i was kind of ok n asked him if he was coming back to Singapore anymore.... then he began saying that he actually wanted to tell me that very day.... n was very puzzled how the old witch knew abt it....He said that he would be there for at least 3 mths....kaoz....3mths leh....!!!! i missed him loads liao when i dun c him for a few days leh....now that i hear 3mths i wonder how i'll b able to cope with it....  He told me that he ll speak to me later aft work but becos we ended work late....there wasnt a chance to do so...  Now thinking back... i think that that day he wanted to meet up with me was to tell me personally abt his resignation...  When i was home, i msg him to ask if i could go out with him b4 18th not.... his response was v positive but still i was v sad abt the news.... haiz.... guess i kind of took it for granted that he ll be working there forever....  Haiz....im scared of crying during work when i dun c him there...  Though i must say that this cannot b considered the end but .... to think of it manz.... already when hes in Singapore, it is so hard to meet outside of work....wats more hes overseas??  Is it possible to stay in touch??
