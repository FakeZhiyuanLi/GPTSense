						   Another blog to see. the next blog button is good for when your on a vacation and board. ive seen a lot of blogs and they belong to kids and men that are right out of state colleges. but this one is good. this woman is happy about her life. i think shes a single parent but she keeps busy with her daughter and writes provoking ideas. i wanted to comment like ive been doing to all the other blogs i went to but theres no room for one. read her post about being a bitch. for the three or four of you who read my blog Gio made a new blog for diferent users so we can all write in it. im going back to work next week so Sanne and Gio can write something for me to read not the other way around. ill send the link in email.  heres the link to the blog i told you about  urlLink becoming ex

						   Our last day before we headed back to finish out my vacation at home. we played on the ps2 for almost 3 hours and ate out for dinner. the kids were acting out at the restraunt and got in trouble. my sister in law overeacted to it though and caused a scene and was mad at the kids during the whole time. past all that we had a good time and we started for home later that evening. so now were back. Gio thinks I should delete the post about teenagers. the girl i had written about started spamming me. Gio is making a blog too so i'll let the rest of you know

						   We saw open water. it sucked and was a waste. we went back and thought about renting goodfellas but the special edition didnt come out until tuesday and we wanted to wait for it. Gio didnt want to watch it he hates those movies that portray italian americans as violent and bad. we had a fight over it and we rented 13 going on 30 instead. it was a cute movie it was kind of like big. so the rest of you skip seeing open water and go rent 13 going on 30.

						   Were back. we drove down to lawrenceville in nj. its a town a little north of trenton where some of my relatives live. we made it to my brothers house and i was so tired from the trip i fell asleep on the couch for 2 hours untill my sister in law woke me up for dinner. i have three neices april karen and christina and a nephew aaron. aaron likes Gio so he talked his ear off most of the evening untill he had to go to bed. we ate a lot and talked about going to see open water.

						   After reading other people's blogs for a month, I finally decided to get one for myself. the four of us tried to get tickets for chicago. Its playing at the ambassador theatre on west 49th if you're in the area. We didn't get them so we went out instead. Gio got the great idea to cross the bridge and go around little italy where he used to live before his x kicked him out just for some albachiara. for those of you that dont know it's a pizzeria and its real good &s but the rest of us didn't want to be out there so far but we went anyway.
