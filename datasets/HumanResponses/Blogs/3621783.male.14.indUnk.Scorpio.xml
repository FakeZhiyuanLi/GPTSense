      me and tristan have this assignment due on friday and we're like 20% through it and we've got heaps more to do. errrr, mite be dropped from set one cos i got this test to do to see how my level one grade is like. soccer was tiring, played the thirds and drew. but we're getting pizza which is pretty cool cos we drew against wesley. these blogs are totally pointless. i must be really bored or something, go ipods and i want an ngage. nearly bought one yesterday cept my bank card was demagnatized so i had to get money off mum to buy some cd's. got an lcd screen for the comp today. thats pretty awesome, way better than the last one, this is starting to sound like my life story or something. ok i'm going to go now.
