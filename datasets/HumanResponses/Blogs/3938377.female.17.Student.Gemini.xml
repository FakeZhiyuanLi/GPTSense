      I really miss talking to Mike. I really need to call him. But everytime I call him to see if he wants to hang out he wants to go to Corey's house. And it's like dude what about some one on one time.  &nbsp;  Not to like dis my man but, you know who is like really hot??? Nick Marnell !!!! I like want to have his babies...like no joke. But he has a beautiful girlfriend (man she so lucky). Why are all the good ones taken?  &nbsp;  But hey we all can't be as lucky as she is. I guess I'll just have to settle!!! JUST KIDDING. Mike is definately an upgrade and not a settlement. But I really do mis him. I'll call him later on today since it's like 12:50 in the friggin' morning.  &nbsp;  I should have called like days ago. But I like already know what our conversation is gonna consist of like... -hey Mike sorry I haven't called in a while-  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -it's my fault I should have called- (well duh!!!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - how are ya??-  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - good, so you like want to hang out at Corey's tonite and chill in the hot tub-  &nbsp;  and that is always how our conversations go. "Dump him" you say. but when you look like me your like not getting enough attention.  &nbsp;  But hey whatever.&nbsp; and there is this really awesome&nbsp;website I think that ya'll should check out,  urlLink http://filebox.vt.edu/users/mfeid/vtpage/milkmovie.html  Milk and Cereal. &nbsp;  And so....

      What the hell man!!! It took me so friggin' long to figure out how to use this god forsaken site. Like c'mon man. I wasted my whole friggin' day trying to figure out how to link xanga and blogger.&nbsp; I just gave up.&nbsp; Like why do they make these sites so hard, and for people like me who are completely computer illiterate.&nbsp; But hey what the heck!!! Like honestly I don't have time for this. But N E Wayz!!! &nbsp; On a lighter note... there is this one movie that looks so incredibly stupid but I feel the need to watch it...."Napoleon Dynamite" (sp).  &nbsp; And so....

       I haven't written in this for like ever. It seems like ages ago... But anywayz, yesterday I had a runway show. At first I didn't want to do it, but it turned out to be pretty fun. The make-up artists were like the best I've seen. So I hope I get to work with them again.  So what's going on with me and Mike??? I really don't know, right know it's like stagnant, and like nothing is going on but, that might change. It frustrates me that I never get to see him. Whenever he's not working, I am really busy, and when he's busy, that's when I want to see him. And soon he'll be going to college and I'm still gonna still be stuck in Algonquin.  I like really have no life. For the simple fact that I am here writting in a weblog instead of talking to friends, that goes to show you how pretty lame I am. But hey... after a while you kinda get used to it.  Oh hell. I have to get ready to go back to school. NOOOOOOOOOO!!! I definately dislike that idea.   And so....
