						   I'm so proud, last night i created a door cover from a white bit of material and a black poster pen. Cos i have a glass window in my bedroom door, you can look through and see things you're not suppose to.   So now i have a door cover that has a black lattice work and a chinese proverb on it. Plus, john's and my names in chinese characters.  OOH OOH. I'm so proud, it actually looks quite good.

						   My new love is battlefield 1942, i get to run around shooting people while the com or the other players actually so all the stuff to win the battle. Apart from the stupid tanks on Wake Island, they were just lining up one behind the other and it seemed no matter how many i killed there were always more.  yeah yeah that's it...

						    Disappointed to hear that the summer epic of King Arthur had been hacked to pieces by reviewers, I have decided to write my own. Let me clarify, this is not a rebuttal as I have not read any of the reviews (I never agree with them). This is just an expression of  my own opinion.  I must admit that I was reluctant to see King Arthur. In my opinion it’s a tired story that has been done so many times in so many genres. Yet this new stray holds something new. Instead of writing a fantasy film, David Franzoni has opted for a realistic version of events set in 500A.D. England. Though the story is not the tale everyone knows today, it can be seen how the story passed on by word of mouth gave rise to the legend. Subtle events in the film can be exaggerated over the centuries into the legend of Excalibur being pulled from the stone and Arthur’s rise to the throne. Even the ‘love-triangle’ between Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere is there. Why would someone die for a person if they did not love them?  The acting, though not spectacular, was certainly not wooden as certain reviewers have described. Today’s audiences and reviewers have been hurt by the over-acting in recent years. Where actors have strained their voices and elaborated gestures to bring that tear to the eye of the watcher. Clive Owen gave a believable performance, portraying the combination of aloofness and camaraderie between Arthur and his knights outstandingly. Arthur as the Roman Commander had to maintain a certain amount of detachment, yet these knights are his only companions on this remote isle. I must admit there were points where Owen seemed to slip into the monologues of theatre. Nonetheless, it was an impressive performance.  The boyish banter between the knights was magnificently written and executed. Conversations that are still witness within modern day circles of male friends. Even, Keira Knightley, who every word out of her mouth in the trailers made me cringe, pulled it all together in the main event. Yet I doubt that playing this version of Guinevere was a difficult role considering her previous films. My favourite bit was when strong-willed Guinevere had to take the lead in bed over the high morals of Arthur. A lesson for today’s women?  In all, King Arthur is an epic of one of the few stories to survive the dark ages in Britain. This film is definitely worth seeing, though it may not be to everyone’s taste being very much a boy’s film.

						    Backpackers.   "Backpackers are know-it-all morons that feel the need to impart their great journey on to very single person they meet."   As you can probably tell, i don't like backpackers very much. If they're not trying to tell everything they've done, they're trying to get into your pants. As a good friend said, 'what's so great about people that can't hold a job and don't wash'. But that could have been the responsible doctor in her coming out. Yet, to a certain extend, i agree, backpackers seem to have the mistaken believe that their journey has given them wisdom and they are superior to others. However, in today's small planet, travelling is extensive.  Just some people do not feel the need to brag.

      I was reluctant to see "I, Robot", because I had heard that it was nothing like the book and I have read quite a bit of Asimov`s stuff.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Although it is true that the film is not the film of the book (apart from anything, it is extrapolated from the 2000s, not the 1940s), there are plenty of fragments from Asimov`s stories, both from "I, Robot" itself and other of Asimov`s works: the film is sort of a collage.  The result is actually an enjoyable film, with several nifty moments, occasional laughs and enough of a plot to keep the attention of someone with an I.Q. higher than a robo-vac.  Look out for when the rogue NS-5 is drawing a picture (in a very clever horizontal and vertical lines way).  The paper under the one he turns over to draw on bears a circuit diagram.  There is a thermionic valve in the middle of the circuit - a nod to the fact that Asimov`s laws of robotics predate the transistor?

      Well i'm now in 'burgh. I'm debating whether or not to actually do my real work (I hasten to add to any of my collegues that may read this...I will do it...) or whether to wander off and go "cover" the Edinburgh Games Festival. That said the first day here has been a little mad, what with missing buses, and I've stared the whole love/hate thing with the City.  there was a moment last night in which a couple of police cars tore down Princes Street, one of which barely missed a young couple with a push chair. I would have followed them to see what the rush was about but I didn't think that I could keep up with them.  I'm also sitting in starbucks using their wireless connection, and I'm suddenly wondering (after having shelled out the £16.50 for the connection) whether or not it'll work in other starbucks? Otherwise I'm gonna have to come back to this particular every single day...Gonna sign off for now, we'll start some "proper" reporting or photography tonight or tomorrow.

      Some news from the West which I was quite shocked to hear, but it appears that there is a chance that Tchai Ovna (?Czech? for "Tea Oven") may end up going the way of other notables like Insomnia (the old 24hour opening one, not the restricted opening one we have now). According to an article buried in The List (Jul-Aug edition) Glasgow city council has granted planning permission for a block of flats, to be put up next to/in Tchai's garden (which used to be wasteland and not strictly part of Tchai Ovna).  Just what we need more luxury flats in Glasgow's West End, where you'll pay in excess of £100,000 for a nice 2 bed flat, and at the expense of one of the most charismatic places and venues in the whole of Glasgow.  Tchai Ovna (http://www.tchaiovna.com/) was started by Martin Fell and his brother 4 years ago, whilst they were students at Glasgow Uni and since then has become focal point of community, playing host to gigs and poetry readings. And no one would ever be derided for spending some time (or even foregoing a whole night on the piss) in this haven of non-alcoholic beverage.  My experience of Tchai was back when a friend of mine used to run an acoustic open mike night (well a little warning was appreciated), and comprised of about 8 of us trooping down to hear another friend play. We sat about and drank tea...lots of tea.

      -Update- Was talking to Sammiches, who expressed a little ?annoyance? about the prospect of moving this, especially after people signed up to Blogger, so I'm not gonna invoke  any draconian measures and just up and move us....anyway I'm having problems with the template for it (only that site however) -PSB   yeah Ok I know that this one has only been going a couple of days now, but we're moving....partly cos i've just shelled out on upgrading my server. So new url will be  urlLink http://www.phoenixproductions.org.uk/someonesgotitalready/   At least until I buy a full domain....which might be next week!  So to inaugurate the move I've put up a post about Tchai Ovna which is facing some problems from annoying developers...Check it Out!  -PSB

      Today, central Edinburgh was shut. Sure enough, the shops were open and there were enough people in the city centre to populate a decent-sized archipelago, but if you'd tried getting anywhere on a mode of transport you weren't born with, you'd have been in trouble.  Today was the day of the annual Festival Fringe Cavalcade which marks the beginning of the Fringe and the proper start of the festival season. Over the next three weeks, the Scottish capital will host no less than six major international festivals - the International Festival, the Fringe, the Film Festival, the Book Festival, the TV Festival and the Tattoo - and countless less important ones, amongst them a computer games festival (at the National Museum of Scotland, no less) and the pick of last year's offerings: the "Czech It Out" beer festival. There will be many thousands of performers of every colour, creed and profession, from every continent and hundreds of thousands more tourists and visitors.  All this is set-dressing. The experience of being in Edinburgh during August is hard to describe to people who haven't done it. At its most basic level, you can look at it in terms of the things you love and the things you hate.  For example, I love the fact that, on my way in to work today, I saw a man walking through the Meadows with a cat on his shoulder. A real, live, purring cat. On. His. Shoulder. At the same time, I hate people who want to "do Edinburgh" but are unwilling or unable to recognise that this will, in fact, involve actually spending money. It may be a cliché to say that there's no such thing as a free lunch, but right now, you won't even get a continental breakfast.  There's more, but I won't bore you. But I'm beginning to think that even the things I hate about Edinburgh at the moment add to the feeling that I wouldn't want to be anywhere else on Earth right now.  For all its flaws - and the Festival brings each and every one into sharp focus - Edinburgh never feels as alive throughout the rest of the year. It's almost as if the city needs hundreds of thousands of outsiders to come here before it can truly be itself.  It's almost as if the city is just waking up.

      I was reading an archive of BoingBoing (in relation to Google buying Blogger actually) when I stumbled upon this  urlLink acticle  about the establishment of an "Eruv" in NW London ( NWLondon Eruv ).  Under Orthodox Jewish law, you are not allowed to carry anything outside of their homes on The Shabbat, this includes medication, books, clothes, pushchairs, prams etc. An Eruv is a Jewish device that allows Jews to carry items by "extending" the boundaries of their homes. Its a "hack" for Jewish law (some things are still not permitted to be carried, like mobile phones).  It makes me wonder what other "hacks" are there for other religons to circumvent restrictive laws/conventions in order to make life a bit easier. Comments below! Tips on how to circumvent restrictive drinking laws & how to go out drinking for 24hours don't count!

       Consider an IRC bot.  Although it may be given the rudiments of a human presence, it will, in all probability, never achieve the state where it may hold a real conversation.    However, the present author would care to propose that, were an IRC bot instructed as to how to detect a question and its corresponding answer, then that bot would eventualy "sound" like it could talk.  The essence of the technique is that the bot hold an array of challenge-  responce pairs: that is to say a structure containing replys referenced buy their arguments.  while listening (to several channels), the bot takes note of what appears to be the answer to a given question (generaly identifiable by the trailing questionmark).  By storing what amounts to a histogram of questions and answers, the bot may be able to determine the most popular answer to a question.  In this manner, the bot will fail to exibit apparent intelegance, but will be able to say who is the biggest buttmunch on big brother.     - Sammiches, 2004/8/7  I've kept in any spelling mistakes -PSB

      The Internet, the last bastion of free speech, free software, and of course free pr0n. And once again some dumb ass lawyer is wading in for a fight. One Stephen Galton (Lawyer-Calif) is sueing Yahoo over the abuse (flaming) that he received on their message boards, after he responded to a critisism of one of his clients.  Now most normal net users, and especially ones who use Usenet and forums can expect that if they say something stupid or something that goes against the general feel of the thread, to get some sort of scathing response (well unless the point is so genius that everyone has an about face...but I doubt it here), so why exactly was he disturbed when he as a lawyer got flamed? Especially when the general opinion of lawyers isn't very high? Most people would let it go and resign themselves to the fact that they're wrong (even if they're not, but the majority thinks they are), but not Mr Galton. He was onto Yahoo asking for, wait for it...the Names, Addresses  and  Phone numbers of the users who flamed him.  Of course Yahoo being one of the best known internet portal & services company turned round and said..."Err WTF? Err ok...no" and provided partial information, afterall can you imagine the stink if they went around giving out peoples names and addresses when simply asked.  Unfortunately for Yahoo (but fortunately for us) this wasn't enough for Mr Galton who has now launched his class action suit on the basis that   Yahoo does nothing to give redress to people who have suffered abuse via its message boards."   Now unless the remarks are slanderous there shouldn't be a problem(lawyer required) everyone is entitled to free expression and free speech, and certainly as far as I'm concerned being flamed in a forum or group is a perfectly good example of free speech and an appropriate response for people who are just being stupid.  I'm sorry but I have no sympathy with Mr Galton, for being a complete IDIOT.And if anyone can find out what Yahoo! message board this happened on let me know!   Links    urlLink Galton And Helm    urlLink Yahoo    Oh and one last thing, this whole incident has led to Mr Galton's email address and telephone number being spread round the internet. So his spam content probably has sky rocketed...serves you right

      Currently don't know what's happening but there are current(1040am) about 6 fire crews sitting outside the Andersonian Library on Cathedral Street in Glasgow, and the building is shut for the rest of the day. And apparently there was an ambulance there earlier.  More news as I hear it.   -Update 11:19-  spoke to one of the security guys, apparently its a gas/chemical leak

      I've added a link to Johnny's  urlLink Newsbomb  site on the side bar. He's got some recent stuff, and a couple of photos of the protest march in Edinburgh about the  People's Army of China  Chinese People's Liberation Army taking part in the  urlLink Edinburgh Military Tatoo .  Personally I don't see what the fuss is about but hey some people protest about stuff. And according to the banner in the top picture its 1.3billion victims...which is roughly the current population...so are they saying that (basically) everyone in China is a victim....hmm is that just generalisation or is there some sort of Anti-communism bend going on there? People may not like the way the Peoples Liberation Party got into power, but hey its pretty much how most fundamental regime changes take place (Boston Tea Party, US Civil War, Russian Revolution, French Revolution, War Of the Roses, English Civil war etc). They just had the gall to do it in a "civilised" age. But then Liberia, Congo, Rwanda were allowed to do it because they're still only "developing" countries.  Anyway hopefully we'll get some stuff from the Edinburgh Festival on here, reviews and the like...And maybe a D!SGIA trip to the fest.

      Not to sound a too callous about this story, but I do have to say "the irony". I turns out that Warren LeBlanc wasn't the owner of " urlLink Manhunt ", it was Stefan Pakeerah the boy who was murdered. This comes after Stefan's parents claimed that the game caused LeBlanc to kill Stefan.  I find these arguements that violent computer games make violent people kinda tedious...yes its true that there is a percentage that may become violent as a consequence of computer games, but then there's a much higher percentage of people who become violent driving a car...does that mean we should ban cars, or sue the makers of cars?  Of course as the article points out, the game is 18 rated, so how in the first place was a 17year old allowed to buy it, but more importantly how did a 14year old get their hands on it, and is there not an issue on the responsibility of the parents here?  I somehow suspect(hope?) that any case that  urlLink Jack Thomson  might want to bring against RockStar North might hit at least a little snag with this news.

      It's the place where we can all be what we want to be.   urlLink Joshua wanted to be an alien .      I never had another "encounter" or "abduction" since that day, but I feel like in the joining I had imprinted the Grey's identity on myself on some level � much like how many Native Americans describe their relationship with their totem animal. When I thought of myself, I never was able to picture just Joshua again... I mean, I was still Joshua of course, but I was also that Grey being at the same time.    I think people have an "internal image" of who they are... When you close your eyes, you know where your arms are, where your heart is, where your mind is, what you look like, and all that. I had that, but it was overlaid with the Grey. Since that encounter I've not been able to think of myself as just human any more.   I think this qualifies Joshua to be the world's first bona fide Transient (as found in Warren Ellis'  urlLink Transmetropolitan ).  So, welcome to future.   If you don't like the skin you're in, get a new one.  (Thru  urlLink Die Puny Humans ).

      I thought that this might be quite interesting to put up here, especially as two of our contributors are Editors of Student papers. Its a little background into how comic syndication got started.  Why it all began... As Michael Jantze was kind enough to explain, the newspaper comics feature was invented as a tool to sell more newspapers. At the time, there were huge newspaper wars in almost every city as more than one paper would compete for readers. If your paper had a cartoon feature that the other didn't, you could draw more readers to YOUR paper. It was big business and the syndicates made a LOT of money from cartoon features. It was shady and handled in back-rooms sometimes. Michael says the term Yellow journalism was coined because of the sneaky things people did to get a hold of the first cartoon: the Yellow Kid.   Over the years, things calmed down some, but competition between papers in the same city was still strong. The syndicated played an important role. They were there to guarantee that cartoon features were edited, family friendly and always delivered on time. The syndicates OWN all the cartoon feature, not the creators themselves. Should a cartoonist crap out, they could just hire someone else to draw it. The papers could buy 10 features and only have to write one check. It was a good system. The syndicates got money for their features and in turn offered something that other newspapers didn't have. Some papers would buy a strip and never publish it, just so the other competing paper couldn't have it on their funny pages.   Today things are very different. The days of two paper cities have long past. Now there's one city per paper and competition is dead. In fact, sometimes the papers of many neighboring cities are all owned by one large corporation. Simply put, newspaper competition is over. Newspapers no longer need comic strips to help them sell papers. The comics page has simply become another expense for them.   Michael Jantze told the crowd at our panel that a 20 comic funny page could cost a newspaper 150,000 a year. Now think about this, because this is the key to my announcement: newspapers are PAYING the syndicates for the privilege of developing their cartoon brands. Think about this. If Coca-cola wants to use newspaper advertising to strengthen it's brand, it has to pay for that kind of exposure. The syndicates makes millions from their comic features via books, television, movies and merchandise. The only way they are able to sustain that kind of income is due to the exposure and advertising that the newspapers give them. But the syndicates offer nothing in return. The funny pages are full of retreaded old strips that have lived way past their prime. Entertainment wise, they provide nothing. The syndicates really got a sweet deal. But that's about to change.    -From  urlLink PVPOnline
