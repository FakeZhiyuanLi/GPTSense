      I spent two years at B school. But this isn't really about B school and how hard it was to get in, or how i let my project mates complete all my assignments.  B school, meant hostel life.. It was the first time that i was living outside my house, and to tell the truth, it wasn't that much fun to start with. My neighbour was a lungi clad (when he didn't have classes anyway) mallu who liked smoking in his balcony at four AM. i don't mind people smoking around me, but just imagine waking up in the middle of the night and thinking that something's burning in your room!   The summers in Lucknow are searing hot and the college administration refused to allow students to install air conditioning or even water coolers, not even at their own expense.. The logic being, that since not all students can afford these, nobody should have them.. Only in India can you have socialist B schools!  Our hostel water tank was on the terrace. If, God forbid, you woke up late one summer day, having a bath was out of the question as the hostel water tanks were on the terrace and by noon, the water was at about the right temparature to cook a pot of rice. Of course, only if your stoned or drunk can you sleep till late when the temparature is over 40 degrees outside the hostel gate (and it feels hotter in your room!)  Cut to home. The sea is about 50 metres away from my house. The weather is decent, the food is great, i don't need to worry about my laundry and best of all, somebody else makes my bed!        and i don't want to go home right now..   So how come this one line from the goo goo dolls song is running through my head non-stop!   Simple. That's because i don't want to go home to a discussion about whether Jassi's saas is really a good person (am i mixing up my soaps here?).   I don't want to be told to have a banana because it's good for blood pressure, and 'son, high blood pressure runs in the family you know?'.   I don't want to have to turn off my music before i go to sleep because it would disturb the family.  I don't want to be told that 'bacche, you can't wear slippers out of the house, it doesn't look nice'.    I want to be able to wear rubber bathroom slippers to class again.   I want to be able to call that pretty exchange student over to my room at midnight (just to study, honest!) and not have to worry about what my grandmother would think.   I want to be able to read till 6 AM, wake up the next afternoon and not have to answer the question 'are you unwell son? how come you are sleeping till so late?'   I want to feel hungry at 1 AM and be able to walk down to the Nescafe outlet and ask for a maggi.   I want to decide what i will wear, where i will go, what i will do and i dont want to have someone talking to me all the time.        and i don't want to go home right now..
