      I really want to get the crap scared outta me...and I finally found a movie that might do the trick.  I rented  The Exorcist ....which is supposedly one of the scariest movies of all time.  My counselor also recommended  Candyman ...which I also got.  Then to top it all off I rented a scary video game:  Silent Hill 2 ...I played the first one...and it was pretty scary...so i will try this one out...I am gonna watch the movies tonight...man...this is gonna be great...  My mom and sister came back from New York.  My mom said ground zero was very depressing...they call it the "footprint" cause it is so big. They visited the restaurant that is pictured in Seinfeld!!  you know the one they always goto?  They just used the outside for the show tho, not the inside...they obviously used a set for the inside....and my mom got a Seinfeld script, and she got me a shirt that says "New York Police Department".  So that's all cool...  well, I am gonna go scare the piss outta me...scary movies time!!...bye bye  "I think I'm turning japanese, I really think so." -Skankin' Pickle

      I saw this movie with my dad....it has Jack Nicholson in it.  Jack Nicholson is a great actor....it is an older movie but it was still amazing...it's about this guy in jail that gets put in an asylum even though he isnt that insane....it was good i recommend that you see it...go rent it now...  lol I just had like a break-down....I got pissed over something....I forget what....and I started hurting and crying....that's never really happened to me...i just got really flustered....ugh...that wasn't fun....crying over nothing....i was actually doing pretty good...i was very happy lately....i guess i was just overdue for some depression....but why should i be depressed lol.....am i supposed to be depressed or something..?

      *sigh* I got the Suicide Machines new cd:  "A Match and Some Gasoline."... you must be thinking  why aren't you happy?....I thought you liked them? ....well...i don't like this cd....I am very disappointed....this cd...is way too hardcore....i mean......i like some hardcore....but some songs are just all screaming...nothing but screaming....I loved in their other cd  Destruction of Definition  they mixed screaming into the singing...and there was more singing....and this new cd.......there are way less ska chords....and it isn't cheery....they got a ton of depressing songs in this cd.....I still like some of the songs (ex : Did You Ever Get a Feeling of Dread? ) but....I am just disappointed....I hope they don't stay like this....too much screaming thats all....and even at some parts it seems like they are rapping...yuk....but....I still love the Suicide Machines...I just like  Destruction of Definition  more....it might even be my favorite cd....  Oh, my sis' rabbit died :(...she was just gone one morning, and there was a hole in the cage.....we thought she chewed out but...we found some brown fur in there...and snowball is all white...so we concluded that a animal chewed thru...and got her....yea....pretty gruesome...well...that rabbit was near its death anyway...it was 8...that is really old for a rabbit....but...everything dies anyways....  hmmm...i think that is it....bye...

      No I am not whacking off.....I am imitating a person I hate....P. diddy....I mean god...he is so sad...not only is he a rapper, but he is also a  very  bad one....all he does is show up in other people's songs and goes, "Uh....yea....uh uh....(insert name of rapper he is with here) is in the house....uh....oh yea...."...I know i shouldn't judge rap cause that's not what i listen to...but i mean i hate rap and i can  still  tell that this guy has no talent in the field of rap whatsoever....Geez man...make your own damn songs....stop feeding off of other people.......man.....I shouldn't really act like i know about rap cause i don't but....man....this guy sucks doing music that  already  sucks....and that just.....sucks....  Anyways, a wierd thing happened on my way back from the gas station (I usually go for a walk to the gas station at night...get a slurpee....and some candy....bring my cd player...sorta get away from it all....).  So, I was walking down the pathway and there is woods on both sides of the pathway....and I saw this thing moving in front of me...like 10 feet away....and it was a skunk....so I started backing away...and i noticed there was another one 10 feet further down....so i backed off and waited.....and then i sort of hung to the right and kept walking once i knew they were outta sight....and then another one came walking across the pathway!  3 skunks?  I was like walking thru a fucking migration or something....or maybe just a momma and here babies.....so i just played it safe and took the long way home which is going al the way to school craft and then walking into my sub on ashurst..........but yea....that's the closest I ever got to a skunk....and that is the most skunks i have seen at once....i believe.....  It is late....my mom has been bugging me about what time i goto bed....but....i shouldn't matter....i would just lay in bed till 2 anyways....cause i am just not tired....  I am redesigning my room....I am gonna have a water theme....one part of the wall will be blue (water)...then the other yellow (sand)...and i'll put like waves in the water and stuff.....I also got a new bedspread.....it has like a water theme on it too.....oh and i got a spongebob alarm clock that plays the spongebob squarepants song for the alarm.....yea....that is a water type theme.....but the best things i got were these lamps....ok you fill them up with water....and then you put plastic fish in them...it's like a tank you fill up....and then air gets pumped into the tank from the bottom and bubbles come up so the plastic fish move all around...and there is a light on the bottom that changes different colors....its hard to explain....but at night i put those on and my lava lamp...so there are all these colors....it would be a good place to have sex *laughs*...dim lights....different colored lighting...wierd lamps....oh yea....ok....i am going off into daydream land again heh.....  but yea....thats whats been going on lately...also been working on the band and-wait i cant talk about that in here....go into my band blog and check it out!....well....i am gonna go....to bed....with all the different color dim lights....and wierd lamps.....wishing i had a girlfriend....to do....in that room that would be good to do stuff in....yea....daydreaming....again.....tired...man....i shouldn't be writing about that stuff.....oh well...it's my blog....i can write whatever the hell i want.....so there.......well....bye  "You say that you love me but you aren't in love with me." -The Vandals

      *Laughs*...I had a good day today...my sister was being nice and she took me along to hot topic where i bought a "Me First and the Gimme Gimmes" record and wristbands and new shoelaces....I just like hot topic for the music and wristbands...i don't like that is is the abercrombie of the punk scene...yea the shoelaces I got are pink and black striped...sweet...and they macth with my black converse...Then we went to wal-mart and we were sifting thru this pile of old bargain dvds and we found "Batman: the movie"!! *Laughs* It was made in 1960s and it had the cast from the tv show....you know the real cheap costumes...and when they hit the guys words popped up on the screen saying "Bap!" and "Zocko!"....So i bought that...because i love batman....and i love old corny movies...  So then I got home and went to Ben's house, where we watch Batman: The Movie.....and I am here to say...that Batman: The Movie....is my favorite movie now.....It is so corny and unrealistic *laughs* it is funny just to laugh at!  Robin acts like priest and every time something happens he says "Holy (insert random word here)!" Here are some examples: "Holy Sardines!" "Holy Merlin's Magician" "Holy Polaris" and there were even some where we couldn't figure out what word he said....and in that movie there were so many ridiculous convieniences....oh man....you have to see Batman: The Movie....it is the best!  Here is how ridiculous one of the scenes were:  In this scene they are trying to figure out who is behind the attack on batman: Batman-"I was attacked by an exploding shark...shark...fish....the penguin!" Robin-"and it happened in the sea...sea...c....c is the first letter of Cat Woman" (Geez!  How did Robin deduct that??) (uhm...they somehow threw the joker into all of this...i forget how they connected him into it) Sheriff-"Man...it's like they threw all this together like a riddle....riddle...er.....The Riddler!"   *Laughs* oh man...here is another:  In this scene Robin and Batman are stuck to a bouy, with a torpedo from the penguins sub heading towards them: *explosion* *villains prance around in celebration* Penguin- "lets see the fruits of our work...." *peers into periscope* "what?? they are gone?" (switches to scene with batman and robin riding away in boat) Robin-"Boy, we sure got lucky..." Batman-"Yes, good thing that porpouise got in the way of that torpedo...he did a very noble thing to give his life for us...." Ok...first of all...why the hell would a porpouise run into a torpedo... and second of all how did you escape from the bouy???  Alright here is another scene where they are trying to figure out one of the riddlers riddles: Batman-"read these riddles robin...and see if you can deduce what i thought when i read them." Robin-"What does a turkey do when it flys upside down?....It gobbles up!" (I personally don't understand that one...) Batman-"Good! and the next one!" Robin-"what weighs six pounds, lives in a tree, and is very dangerous?  A sparrow with a machine gun!" (I swear to god that is what Robin said.....a sparrow...with a machine gun.....how..?....how did he..?....nevermind...) Batman-"now put the two together" Robin-"gobbles up....a sparrow.....what gobbles up a sparrow? a cat!...Catwoman!"  So there is a nice preview for you of the loads of fun Batman the movie is....please watch it...you will laugh....i didn't even mention some of the really funny stuff....well...I think I am done...adios!

      STOP ASKING ME THAT!....I hate the phrase..."what's up"....everybody uses it...instead of saying "How are you?" or "How's it goin?" we say "What's up?"...and everybody says, "Nothing much, you?"...and then the conversation is continued as normal....so what use is it to even ask, "what's up?"   If something is up, I will tell you! ........It seems less caring...asking "what's up" instead of "how are you?"...and we are so lazy we have to cut back on the "what's up?" so now it's just, "sup"....  So if you want to know what is up with me...don't ask...don't worry...be pacient....you just say hey, and then I say hey...then we skip the whole "sup", "nm" crap...and I will tell you if anything new is going on....instead of asking "what's up?"  why don't you ask me how I am doing....  kind of a stupid thing to rant about....well, at least I am starting to rant a little bit more...nothing else to say on that issue....adios...

      Yea...I can't sleep...I don't feel like sleeping...  I had a very odd feeling today...I was riding home from my dad's house....it was dark out, and there was this song playing that i don't remember the name of, but i liked it.....but what i mainly remember was how dark it was...I dont know why....but I felt extremely humbled...yet I felt very anxious at the same time (anxiety not anxiousness)....it was very odd....so I just sat there-arms crossed because my dad always blasts the AC-waiting to get home...well...to my mom's house I should say.....  I was kinda mad...because I was in a pretty good mood because I was talking to my friends when I got home...and then I had to get off cause my sister wanted to get on.....and that makes me mad cause I look forward to talking to some of my friends....just being around people you know care about you...even if they don't tell you......eh....I don't want to get all mushy because I think mushiness can get  really  corny....  No band practice till tuesday....Ben is at Cedar point....last I heard from him he got in a fight with his girlfriend....I hope everything is okay with that...I'd hate to see him all stressed over that....i never seen him go out with somebody this long....he really loves that girl...  I just took out the trash....and it was very surreal outside....I never been out in my neighborhood at 1:30 in the morning...and it is extremely quiet....almost in a humbling way......but I saw flickers of light...at first I thought it was the street light flickering or a bug zapper....but it was in the sky, and I guess it was lightning...but there was no thunder....and the sky is an eerie red right now....and it seems too bright to be 1:30....I hope it does rain.......the pitter patter of rain drops lull me to sleep....ugh that last sentence was very....uhm...can't remember the word.....but I am gonna go back outside and sit on my porch...because the silence is very comforting.....well...that's all for now...later...

      Good news...I realize I am not depressed as I was before....wanting to die...bad appetite...lacking sleep....it all seems to be in the past.  Maybe it's the medication I am on...or maybe I am just heading to better times...  For those who don't know, I hit an extreme low spot in late may-early june....it was alot of things....then I just blew up cause the stress was too much, and i threatened to hurt myself.... I went into therapy, and just a couple weeks ago I was started on Zoloft (an anti-depressent) and I also switched therapists (the first one wanted to send me to a mental hospital *sweatdrop*).  I got a new therapist...a young guy that went thru a divorce himself, so he can relate to alot of issues I am having...and he also plays guitar like me!  The only problem I hit so far was last week....I hit that low again...and I got close to doing something really stupid...now I am more chipper than ever it seems....but I still feel like myself...which is great because I was afraid the meds would make me feel like I wasn't myself...  well...i thought I would just get that out that....I just hope I don't hit anymore low spots....it seems it's all easy sailing from here...

      Ah...it's sunday, and I still love the fact that I don't have to get up early anymore to goto church.  I am watching the British Open...it's wierd I used to hate watching golf, but now I don't mind....maybe because I golf more now.....I hope Tiger Woods wins...I always was a Tiger Fan...He really hyped up the sport and got more people involved.  2 more days till the new Riverdales Album comes out!...I still have no idea where I am gonna buy it...it is probably going to be kinda hard to find....I might get lucky and find it at Best Buy...they have Ben Weasel's other albums....but if all else fails I can get it offline at Look Out! Records.com....  I smell cinammon rolls!....mmmm....I guess that is it for now....sorry if you have been searching for more controversy like my old posts, but I haven't had much to rant and rave about lately....later!

      I  am going out of my mind sitting here...i want to go out and do  something ....I got my driver's permit...yay for me......i like driving...it's fun...  So yea....I have nothing to do....nothing to talk about....I am just really bored....I wrote a couple songs.....I finished  "I Am In Love With A Girl Who Has Narcolepsy" ...the guitar parts and everything...I can't wait to work on that...it's a funny song...I wish I could type the lyrics out on here, but I am afraid some asshole will steal the lyrics.  Me and Mike were hoping to practice today but we couldn't get ahold of Ben....he was with his girlfriend...but he hasn't seen her in awhile and he wont see her till tuesday...so that's ok...  So, I am just running around the house playing with my cat while I blast The Suicide Machines on my computer....I have to admit, in the past couple days I fell in love with the Suicide Machines...They are so great!  You know Nike bought Converse?  Yea, it happened like a week ago....I hope Nike doesn't put a damn nike logo on the chucks....that would look stupid.

      Oh, yea.....we had a great practice we accomplished alot.  We have a name!....it's....*drumroll*... Los Chicas!  *laughs*  We got the idea because there is a store named Chicos and it is a store for girls, but in Spanish, chicos means boys.  So, for our name we did the reverse, and just to screw things up we added a "Los" which is masculine, instead of "Las"...*laughs* I know...it's confusing....it's stupid...it's perfect....we don't want a normal name...we want a stupid name so people will be curious and have to check us out *laughs*   We also have all agreed that Ben will be the lead singer (our bassist).  We found out that I cannot sing....long story....has to do with volume and stuff.....and Ben has more balls than I do....So we are all set to go....we are gonna start getting serious now.  We also have our stage names: Ben Peters- Ben Jamin Mike Sochalski- Murhur Andrew Schultz- Shizults (I hate it, but...everybody else seems to like it)  We have 2 songs pretty much down.  First is  "Stupid Naive Little Boy" ...I wrote it about myself, and Ben is singing it, and if anybody asks, it's about me....I wrote it...Ben is just singing it...The only thing we need to do to finish the song is that Ben has to memorize the lyrics so he can play and sing at the same time. Second is the first song we learned....it never had a name...and we could never seem to apply lyrics to it...so it is an instumental song....we are going to add horn parts later to spice it up....and it will be called,  "The 1st Song."   Clever huh?  That's all for now....but man, I am totally stoked to see this crummy band finally starting to get somewhere.....Los Chicas are in full throttle!

      I saw that movie with my friend Mike yesterday, and I liked it.  I thought I wouldn't but I did.  It had good special effects, and good acting (Sean Connery is old but he can still act).  The only problem was that it had one of those endings that left you hanging......I  hate  it when they do that!!!  So there will definitely be a sequel.   Good movie though, recommend you see it.  I am ungrounded today, so the band is gonna practice today!  I am stoked for that.  I am gonna sit down and work on some songs after I finish blogging.  I also need to pick up my room....but I don't know if I can lift it...*cymbal crash*....sorry....i know that was  really  corny.  I had a longer post, but my computer messed up and it erased it >_

      I am bored....I am going to be ungrounded tomorrow, so the band is gonna practice...and i have written lots of lyrics, when we get started we will have such songs as  "I Want Beyonce To Be My Fiance", "Skank Till Ya Drop",  and  "I Am In Love With A Girl That Has Narcolepsy"  (last song is obviously fictional).  I would post the lyrics to these songs, but I fear somebody will steal them....and i shouldn't even put the names of the songs down cause people might steal those.   "Skank Till Ya Drop"  will probably be the funnest to work with but also the hardest because I never wrote a song with upbeat ska chords.  I will figure it out eventually.  We should also think of a name too...that would be good.  Right now I am listening to The Suicide Machines,  I had one of their previous albums (their self-titled one) and I just got Destruction by Definition.  And the two cds sound as though there are two different bands playing in them.  The self-titled has slower songs, not many ska chords, and 2 very hard songs...almost hard rock.  Destruction of Definition has a ton of ska chords and alot of fast songs.  Very hardcore.  But I still like both cds so it's ok.   I also got a Nerf Herder cd....Ben suggested it to me before.  and I am pleased with it....its a good cd also.  My e-mail is up at top if you like my blog.....or even if you hate it.  I like some feed back.  Also I could use some ideas for a band name...so just give me a buzz if you have any ideas.

      I was born and baptized into catholicism.  There is the first problem.  I had no decision over what faith I chose.  I was forced into believing something that I might not have been OK with.  And I am not OK with it anymore.  Catholicism is a corruption.  It always was.  When you go into World History in High School you will find out how corrupted it was.  Money hungry nobles and secular ideas....sigh....not only that but what is so great about a religion where old perverted preist molest little boys and get away with it?  I don't go to church anymore....

      Math is the most stupid subject ever.  I don't mean the basic stuff like multiplication and adding.  I mean geometry and algebra.  Who needs to know the area of a kite??  Oh yea I bet in 30 years I will be wondering,  hmmm I wonder if these two shapes are similar or congruent.   Or maybe in college I will be trying to figure out which pizza is a better deal by finding the area of the pizza and then comparing the price to find out how much each damn little piece of pizza is worth.    And finally I have proof that not even the math teachers don't know when we would use these subjects in our lives.  We were doing some theroms or whatever and it was boring so we asked, "when will we use this later in life?"  The teacher replied,"in college courses."  We said, "No, when will we use this outside of school."  You know what she said??  NOTHING .  She couldn't think of anything so she changed the subject lol.    Here is my idea.  We should be taught what we actually need in life.  Like how to do taxes, and other finances that we will actually need to know to get through life.  But no....that would be to convenient wouldn't it?

      As a children, some of us dream of being giant rock stars.  And still at this age people think,  wow, that would be so cool if I were in a band.   I was watching VH1 and they showed interviews of random people and they asked, "How would you like touring around the world as a musician?" and most of them answered they wished they could and it sounded like a lot of fun.  I laughed at that because I have heard what tours are like, and they suck.  Being in a band sucks.  The only reason you should be in a band is if you love making music....and i mean  love  it with a passion and if you do it for any other reason....you are insane.  Money.  Why does everyone believe that you become insanely rich as a musician?  You are actually very poor.  Using all your money to buy equipment.  Also, musicians have to benefits (ex: retirement benefits).  People think musicians are rich because they watch MTV and believe that is every band in the world right there.  There are actually thousands of bands dying everyday.  Getting on MTV is like winning the lottery.  You have a very few chance to get big, and when you do get big you have fans that don't want you to get big.  Which leads me to my next topic.  Fans.  Think about it.  Your life is in the hands of a obsessed teenage music fanatic, you just hope to god that they keep buying your cds .  Then when you do something wrong (ex: sell-out, change your style of music) they will flip out.  Hating you in an instant.  I do this not when a band sells-out, I hate a band I used to like when they change how they sound to make money.  I read in Ben Weasel's  Punk Is A Four-Letter Word  (great book everybody should read it) about on tours fans would chuck beer bottles at the band, and scream at them to play faster.  Which leads me to the next thing:  Tours.  Ah, yes.  The scenery.  The people.  The cities.  It all seems so glamorous.  Here is the truth:  1.Scenery:  The inside of a van, crammed with your other band mates and equipment, and every once in awhile stopping to sleep at a hotel.  2.The people: most likely assholes.  I don't just mean the fans.  Sometimes the people that you were supposed to play with don't even show up.  And sometimes the problem is a lack of people.  Nobody shows up.  And you play with no pay.  3.The cities:  You won't have time to see the cities and all the fun it has to offer.  It isn't a vacation, it's a job.  The good things about touring is seeing people really get into your music, and being in front of a large audience, and them liking it.  Oh, and as for being with your best friends for a couple weeks...it isn't fun.  By the end of the tour you will hate your bandmates no matter how good of friends you were.  But a little break from eachother usually fixes that.  As Ben Weasel once said, "Whenever somebody comes up to me talking about making a band, I say 'Don't do it.'"....or something like that....it was in his book.   (Note: I know I haven't experienced all of these things, I gathered this information thru many sources)

      Damnit.  What have we become??  Can humans simply not  lift up your pants  (this is more for guys than chicks)?  I don't understand that these preps can go out and buy and outfit for more than 100 dollars, and yet they don't seem to have enough money to buy a damn belt!  So then they walk around all day holding their crotch trying to keep their pants from falling down.  Doesn't that look sophisticated? Then they do that funny waddle, which I love to laugh at.  What confuses me further is how the pants can fall down that far, but not all the way.  I mean the pants are at their knees, are they hanging there by a thread?  I almost feel sorry for you dipshits in the winter time having to cope with the elements with you pants hanging off your knees.   Belts are so simple to use.  Why don't you use them??  You slide it thru the loops on the side of your pants, put the end though the buckle, slip the bar through a hole in the belt, and you are ready to go.   Oh and also, why do preps buy abercrombie stuff and american eagle crap for like 50 dollars each.  It's just an ordinary t-shirt with abercrombie written on it!  You idiots!  Don't laugh at me for going to the thrift store.  Look at yourselves!! I laugh at you cause you all look the same!  And you buy overpriced shirts that aren't even that great.  You get one shirt for like 20 bucks.  I can get a sack of clothes-a whole wardrobe- for just 10 bucks.  And you laugh at  me ??  I hope you don't love your money because you won't be seeing much of it in the future if you spend money like you do now.   You make me sick.

      I never really thought much of the 2000 election and the recount thing in Florida until I recently bought War on Errorism by NOFX.  It is an enhanced CD that included a preview of movie called Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election.  This preview shocked me because it gave evidence of the election being a scam.  That Bush cheated in winning, and other injustices, here is what I got from that preview:  *Thousands of ballots were purged because they accused some of the people being criminals, but in each county of Florida, at least 15% percent of the people were innocent of any crime.  That is 1,000 voters.  Half of them were black, and 93% of black voters voted for Al Gore.  You do the arithmetic....there’s the presidency.  *Of 6,137,938 ballots cast in Florida, Bush was still ahead by 1784 votes, and on November the 10th it was announced that Duval county in Florida, 27,000 ballots were thrown out.  16,000 of them were from places that voted 98% democratic.  *Manuel recounts have been done thousands of times and have been known to be more accurate than machines.  A bush spokesperson, James A. Baker III, came on before the manual recount and said “The nation [should] leave manual counting because it was more prone to human error or mischief.”  The Republicans did everything they could to stop the manual recount, a demonstration was led to stop the manual recount.  Can you guess who led it?  National Republicans.  * On December 8th,The Florida Supreme Court ordered all of votes not picked up by the voting machines be recounted.  The next day the recount started.  A couple hours later Bush’s supporters stopped the recount.  The Supreme Court turned a blind eye to the actual disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters.  *The Florida Supreme Court had a governing principle for 75 years: “The intent of the voter prevails over technicalities.”  They completely ignored  it; they made believe it didn’t exist.  Vincent Bugliosi, an author, said, “In a fair world, these five people [Florida Supreme court], and I am going to say this with every fiber of my being... These people are criminals in the true sense of the word .”  To buy the full length video of Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election or see the preview I saw, goto  urlLink www.unprecedented.org  or buy NOFX's new cd War on Errorism, which you should get anyway because it is sweet.

      Finally, a place to write about my thoughts and (possibly) get heard.  First issue I want to address: downloading ( stealing ) music off the internet.  First off here is to all you people who say, "musicians got money, I can just take it from them cause they are rich."  This is true for bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, and i recommend stealing all of their music so you can put them out of business.  But this is not true for the good stuff that isn't on MTV.  What?  There are bands out there that aren't on MTV??  I mean bands like nofx and the riverdales....they don't have money!  The only 2 reasons to download music from bands such as these are:  1. That you want to get a sample of their music, but once you download, and like the band, then you  go out and buy  the cd. 2. You are downloading punk covers (like I do) because those songs were just made for fun, and the bands aren't making any profit off of those.  And I laugh when people download music from there favorite bands because they are  killing their idols careers!   See here is the record industry in a nutshell....  1. Record company gives the band money to make a cd 2. Band uses that money to make their cd 3. Band gets money to pay back record industry through cd sales and if the band doesn't have money to pay back the record company says, "screw you, we are through with you." and they drop them like yesterdays news.  So, if you steal songs off the internet the only thing you are doing is taking money from the band and which in turn sends your own band into a slow downfall, and then eventually dying off completely.  So, if you hate a band steal the songs and hope they go out of business.  But if you love a band then you should buy the cds, so the band can prosper and love you back too.

      I am so fuckin upset :( :(....I was really lookin forward to maybe recording on Monday...that would have been so fun...I know I am not supposed to talk about band stuff in here but this really affects my mood...I feel like just not going up north so maybe we can record this weekened...but then my dad would be really mad...maybe I can just come home saturday night and record sunday...wait...I just called my dad lol while i was typing this...He said no...and asked if i wanted to go and I said I didn't know anymore and he got upset and said, "let me know when you do know good bye."...I tried calling ben to see if maybe we could record on the weekend so I could decide if i wanted to go or not but he is with his dad... FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I wanna record so bad, I wanna be heard....dammit....I don't even think Ben cares, I ask him if he wants to practice or record or something and he always says, "I dunno..." I don't think he ever knows what he is doing a certain day until that day comes...which doesnt help me at all...  "That producers with computers fix all my shitty tracks" Ben Folds

      alright...not all the guys...but I just wanna clear up a bunch of stereotypes for you ladies out there:  1.  Guys Prefer Virgins . False, for me it is anyways....I am not sayin I want a whore, but a girl with some experience would be nice...cause then they wont be all nervous...  2.  Guys want girls so be like their mom . False, I want you to love me and nuture me like a mother, but moms are fuckin' naggy and annoying...and dont have much in common interest wise....don't be like mom's like that......  3.  Guys like girls with humongous boobs . In my opinion...false...ugh...big boobs like the size of fucking watermelons...turn me off...too big...I just like a handful...It all has to do with proportion for me...like a proportional girl...  i can't think of anything else....i am reading this over and it seems pretty stupid...oh well...

      I think people that hate the All American Rejects just cause they are "crybabies" is fuckin stupid. Here are my 2 main points of why they are still good:  1.) Lyrics aren't everything.  Their album is pure genius music-wise.  When I first got the CD I mainly listened to "Swing, Swing" and I saw them as mediocre musicians.  I told that to Ben a few months ago, and he laughed.  Then I listened to the whole CD...I went behind all the normal stuff and there are so many small tiny additions...timpanis...chimes....and they fit in perfectly....When I first got the CD I listened to a song like Track 8 and then skipped it cause it just had an acoustic guitar going and it seemed boring.  But if I was a little more patient and waited for the other stuff to come in, I would find out that this was a very good song.  Sure, many of their songs have very simple guitar riffs, but simple doesn't mean suck.  Some people don't realize that.  Having complicated music doesn't make you any better.  A simple riff could be an extremely musical experience when put together with other simple parts.  The second track on their CD is a fantastic song yet the guitar is so simple to play.  The bass line is also easy, but extremly addicting in the begining.  Some people are so ignorant to never look behind the fuckin lyrics.  It's called MUSIC for a reason.... THERE IS MUSIC IN IT ...If you want to be amazed by lyrics and such goto a free form poetry club where they bang on bongos and say very deep poems that barely anybody can understand.... LISTEN BEHIND THE WORDS TO THE MUSIC.   2. Just cause they are crybabies doesnt make their their lyrics suck.  Not only are there music good, but some of the metaphors and sayings in the lyrics are so deep they boggle my mind.  Sure they are bitching about lost loves and such, but they change how they say it from other bands by making it extremly deep.  I am a songwriter myself (I write much of the lyrics to the punk/ska/ and maybe some emo band, Just For You[not that the other boys in the band don't do any work...they are very good musicians themselves and edit much of my songs and we make them sound better])....anyways...I am a song writer myself and I wish I could begin to write as the All-American Rejects write their lyrics....I mean fuck...they are good...here are some examples  * Please speak slowly, my heart is learning, teach me heart ache stop this burning...   Too Far Gone   * Your lips are a shelter for the things I don't know   Too Far Gone   * one boy, one girl, two hearts their world, time goes by,secrets rise, one more sad song, tears shed she's gone, she'd take it back if she only could, and all the perfect words they seem so wrong  she's gone,  you wish you could learn to see,  the door is closed and you wish you could be, alone with you alone with me   One More Sad Song   * please just dont play with me,  my paper heart will bleed,  this wait for destiny won't do, be with me, please, I beseech you, Simple things, that make you run away, Catch you if I can   My Paper Heart   * So bottle up old love, And throw it out to sea, Watch it away as you cry.    My Paper Heart   Sure, they aren't the best lyrics...but they are still really good...I mean...I wish I could write lyrics like that...'cept about other things besides broken hearts and such...these guys could be poets...  Well, that's why you shouldn't hate the All-American Rejects for being crybabies....love hurts alot of the time in my opinion...so if you don't think they should be bitching about it, then you probably never experienced it.   No lyrics this time cause there are plenty in the rant I just wrote

      I'm sick of hearing, "The blackout brought our nation together...closer...people didn't loot anything and the nation didnt go crazy...we are such a well-behaved country..." No!...god doesnt it seem sorta low to think that as soon as the power goes out we are supposed to turn into homicidal cannibals... "Oh that man is helping at traffic lights that arent working...I'm so glad he is doing that instead of bashing my head with a brick." and looting is actually a good sign of optimism...the person is basically saying, "the power's out but I am absolutly sure the power will come back, then I will be happy I have this new microwave oven..."  But seriously folks...the blackout didnt bring Detroit into happy little friendly town where everybody gets along...the  FUCKING LIGHTS WENT OUT!  that's it!...sure, some people were helpin give water to people and such, but for every person that would do that there would be another person passed out drunk in alleyway in Detroit cause that's how Detroit is...and always will be...

       The following was found  urlLink here  .....  Seppuku is the ancient art of killing yourself if you get super pissed and can’t find anybody else to kill.  Ninjas use all sorts of crap to kill themselves—guns, ropes, knives, lasers, spears, etc.—and don’t even think twice about it.  These guys would kill themselves for just about any reason and often for no reason at all: that’s why we there are so few ninjas today.     But if you want to commit Seppuku and you’re like me, you don’t have access to stuff like lasers.  But there’s hope.  I tried to kill myself by swallowing a frisbee a couple of times—and believe me, it’s pretty cool.  The only catch is you have to be  really  super pissed to do it.     Step 1    Get a frisbee from the store or friend.  Step 2    Clean the Frisbee.  Step 3    Make sure your parents aren’t around  Step 4    Put something slippery on it, like butter or cream.  Step 5    Get  really super pissed.   Step 6    Fold the Frisbee hard  (this is crucial)   Step 7    Keep folded and insert Frisbee into mouth  hard.   Step 8    Push hard until you can’t see it.  Step 9    Wait.  Step 10  Die.      If you succeed, everybody will be like  “Holy Crap!”

      Found a totally sweet site on Ninjas...and it is so hilarious here is an example:  "If you don't believe that ninjas have REAL Ultimate Power you better get a life right now or they will chop your head off!!!  It's an easy choice, if you ask me.    Ninjas are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are totally awesome and that's a fact.  Ninjas are fast, smooth, cool, strong, powerful, and sweet.  I can't wait to start yoga next year.  I love ninjas with all of my body (including my pee pee). "  LOL...including my pee pee...that is so great...you can find this link under the "Other" Links...also made a new section..."Web Comics" where you can find cool web comics to read when you are bored...

      Through out the years I have been doing a vast research of Scooby Doo...going behind the scenes and finding out the dirt on everybody...Here is the truth of each character:  Shaggy-The biggest hippy of all of the bunch...he never bathes and can usually be found passed out in the back of the Mystery Machine from ODing himself with alot of drugs.  He has a very bad eating habit but takes so much drugs that he stays skinny.  And yes his name Shaggy does have a meaning to it...His real name used to be Walter...but now he is a pimp and he sells his bitches right out of the mystery machine...  Daphne- A huge whore...one of Shaggy's more favorite bitches....She will screw for anybody that has money.  She is crawling with herpes and several other STDs from the orgies Shaggy plans in the back of the mystery machine...no that isn't a mole on her face.....and lets just say she is so used up she can't keep her legs crossed....  Freddy-A raging homosexual...he wears a neckercheif, isnt that enough to prove it?.....and his lover is the guest star Robin, Batman's sidekick...When they join forces to solve a mystery they usually end up...well...y'know....  Velma- Nobody is really sure if Velma is a girl or a boy...only Shaggy knows cause when he is messed up he screws anything that moves...She needs glasses cause one time she got maced when approaching a lady for directions while the gang was stuck in the middle of nowhere...which is where they always seem to be...."Jinkies!" really means "Holy shit!" in Velmanese...  And finally the dog himself...  Scooby Doo- is Scooby Doo real?  Why, yes he is an actual dog that goes along with the kids on their trips...he was raised by Shaggy when found abondened on the streets...Shaggy hoped Scooby could provide protection that was need to live in the world of hookers and drugs...Can scooby talk? Nooooo....Scooby talking is only a hallucination the gang has when they use too much LSD...  The monsters- all LSD hallucinations  Well...that's the truth behind Scooby Doo....I may find more on this scandal later...

      Yesterday was really crazy fun...Mike came over and we went to Moe's Arcade...somebody i know from band works there I guess...and i wasted 2 dollars on a pinball machine only to realize the balls were stuck...then I went to the south park pinball machine...I totally kicked ass on that one...we walked home and went to Mike's block party his neighborhood was throwing...We were bored so we rode bikes up to Media Play where I bought  Fade to Bright  by  Squirtgun ....Dan Lumly the drummer from Screeching Weasel and the Riverdales is the drummer for Squirtgun...and Mass Giorgini the bass player also is from Screeching Weasel...and then Ben was tellin me about this Ben Folds CD...so I got that...it is pretty sweet...anyways...after media play we went to the thrift store...but i couldnt find any cool shirts...or hats...or anything...i was disappointed...but then we went back to the block party and ate some more...good cheeseburgers...then there was a box of sparklers that they were handing out to the kids...we took about 20 of them when they werent looking and set them off at once...but that really didnt satisfy my pyro tastes...as I said to Mike, "Sparklers are like the gay cousin of the firework." and the adults were actin like pricks and wouldnt let us go near the good shit......the bottle rockets and such and they were playing Motown and got pissed when we played our cd....so me and mike went for a joy ride LOL...we got in his dad's explorer and mike drove me around the neighborhood...and no he doesnt have a liscense...yes he is only 15....and yes he is supposed to only drive with his parents....so we drove around his sub blaring,  "Rockin the Suburbs" by Ben Folds LOL.......fun shit....and we didnt even get caught like we usually do when we do something wrong....So then Me and Mike came over here and watched Pi...a very creepy and odd movie about a mathmetician on the brink of insanity trying to figure out patterns in the stock market and in pi (you know....3.14) ....it sounds like it should be boring but it is very odd and creepy...and now I am just chillin here today....Me and Mike hope Ben can practice when he gets home...that would be sweet...well I am gonna go...adios  "i'm rockin the suburbs." -Ben Folds

      Last night was very eventful...I was bored so I decided to walk around for awhile it was around 10 o clock PM.  I was walkin down Hix road and a car pulled up in an empty parking lot....no reason to really be there...it was like a school parking lot...so this guy gets out and is talkin to somebody thru the passenger side window...I pass them...and then the guy starts walking behind me...I turn off my headphones in case the guy is sneaking up on me trying to kidnap me or rape me or something...and there are these construction signs leaning against a pole on the corner of Hix and Ann Arbor Road...right next to my subdivision...I turn around and look and the guy is takin the stop sign...and I am wondering if this guy is from the construction...then suddenly this voice comes from my neighborhood across the street,  "HEY!! I ALREADY GOT YOUR LISCENCE PLATE NUMBER, YOU BETTER PUT THAT SIGN BACK BEFORE I CALL THE COPS!!"  The kid is stupid and drops the sign and takes off when the guy probably was lying about having his liscence plate cause it was practically pitch black and the car was across the street...the guy would need fuckin binoculars...so I just kept on walking....Now I am on a mission... I want that stop sign ...that kid was stupid trying to get it at 10 o clock when people are still awake...I am gonna go out at midnight...risk gettin caught by cops....and get that sign...and there is another one across the street close to my neighborhood...I'll probably get that one...but I want that stop sign...  In other news...and more importantly... I took a warm shower today!!   I am so happy to have everything back to normal with electricity and running water....well...I am hungry..and I might see Freddy vs. Jason with Mike and maybe one of his girlfriend's friends...I dunno why they hang out...i didn't hang with my girlfriend's friends...cause she would probably get suspicious and jealous...oh well....all that matters is that I am gonna see a movie today...  One more thing before I go...I am finding myself listening to the Clash alot and MUstard Plug...I know a weird mix...but I just started gettin into them...even tho i got their CDs a couple months ago...but thats what happens when you have too many CDs...

      OK...I am really starting to get pissed off...listen to how bad Bush is with America's Economy:  "And I've got to tell you something: I'm worried about people being able to find jobs. My economic plan is based upon this word: jobs. I want to ask that question all around the country, what do we do to create work? There's a lot of good people who want to work, and we've got to help them find work. And so I'm asking Congress, when they come back, to keep in mind one word: jobs." President George W. Bush, January 28, 2002  So...you are thinkin...oh he must be true to his word...I bet millions of more people have jobs thanks to George Bush... WRONG!! ...In January 2001 about .7 million people were long-term unemployed...around the time Bush was put in office...what is the number of long-term unemployed americans now? Almost 2 million....that is more than double since Bush started!!! DAMN! man... BUSH SURE STICKS TO HIS WORD.... .... yea and I got pigs flying out of my asshole...   Not only that but stocks are plummeting and consumer confidence is on the downfall...I got this info from  urlLink here ....  What about these tax cuts he is making? how much are we gonna save? The White House says that the average American will receive $1,083 under President Bush's 2004 Re-election Tax Scheme.  The reality? The vast majority of Americans won't get nearly that much. Here's what the Bush tax scheme really looks like: *20 percent of the americans have an income of 0-16,00...they will save only about 6 dollars...practically nothing *20 percent of the amercians have an income of 16,000 to 29,000 dollars...they will save about 99 dollars *another 20 percent has an income of 29,000 to 46,000 dollars...they will save about 289 dollars *and another 20% has an income of 46,000 to 79,000 dollars...their tax cut will be about 657 dollars *15 percent of americans have an income of 77,000 to 154,000 they will save 1,841 dollars...ok...so we finally reached around where bush said we would save... *4% of americans have an income of 154,000 to 374,000...they will save a  3,542 dollars *1 percent makes more than 374,000...their tax cut will be a whopping 30,127  so...only about 20% of the americans will be getting as much as or more than Bush promised....does 20% seem like the average american....no...we are talking upper class people...rich people...not the average american...so...how much will Bush save on his own plan? Bush would save  $16,511 ....and Vice President Cheney? His tax cut is a whopping  $104,823  on Bush's tax scheme....so is Bush's tax scheme for the average american or for  himself ?   So how is this effecting michigan...I would like to thank democrats.org for supplying me with this info...and all the other info...:   59,700   Michigan workers who have lost jobs since Bush took office    128,500   Michigan workers in danger of losing unemployment benefits    $7.6 billion   401(k) benefits lost by Michigan workers    $116 million   Lost in the Michigan state pension funds due to corporate scandals    10.4   The percentage of Michigan's population currently without health insurance     besides in michigan, Bush has presided over a 94 percent decline in the federal budget surplus -- that's $5.3 trillion gone in less than 2 years.  If you live in a different state then Michigan feel free to find out how Bush screwed your state up the ass by clicking  urlLink here ....this is all a sample you can find in Democrats.org....there is so much info against Bush on that site...I can only give you a handful of info....I would love to type more...but I am far to lazy...why don't you just go there yourself...

      I received an e-mail from democrats.org....I get one weekly I believe with more information of Bush lying about nuclear weapons:  Washington Post Exposes White House Deceptions Dear Andrew Schultz,  As the recall circus in California dominates the headlines, we wanted to make sure you knew about an important development in the story of President Bush's deceptions leading up to the war with Iraq.  Americans have known for months that President Bush used weak evidence of weapons of mass destruction to push for an immediate, unilateral war with Iraq.  But in a devastating report this week, the Washington Post showed how the Bush administration systematically distorted the evidence, continuing to mislead the public after learning that the evidence contradicted their statements.  Throughout the fall of 2002, and into the weeks preceding the war in Iraq, Bush and his aides repeatedly cited intelligence that experts considered doubtful, or even untrue.  As Bush's public warnings grew more and more dire, the evidence supporting them grew more and more flimsy.  Bush's Statements Contradicted By Facts Read on to see how the Post's August 10 report picks apart Bush's claims that Iraq's nuclear program presented an imminent threat to the United States.   Bush's Statement    "A report came out of the... [International Atomic Energy Agency], that [the Iraqis] were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need." Camp David, 9/7/02     The Washington Post says....  "There was no new IAEA report... Bush cast as present evidence the contents of a report from 1996, updated in 1998 and 1999. In those accounts, the IAEA described the history of an Iraqi nuclear weapons program that arms inspectors had systematically destroyed."     Bush's Statement  "Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon." United Nations, 9/12/02    The Washington Post says...   "Gas centrifuge experts consulted by the U.S. government said repeatedly for more than a year that the aluminum tubes were not suitable or intended for uranium enrichment. By December 2002, the experts said new evidence had further undermined the government's assertion. The Bush administration portrayed the scientists as a minority and emphasized that the experts did not describe the centrifuge theory as impossible."     Bush's Statement    "Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud." Cincinnati OH, 10/7/02     The Washington Post says...  "What Hussein did not have was the principal requirement for a nuclear weapon, a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium or plutonium. And the U.S. government, authoritative intelligence officials said, had only circumstantial evidence that Iraq was trying to obtain those materials."     Bush's Statement    "The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group of his 'nuclear mujahedeen,' his nuclear holy warriors." Cincinnati OH, 10/7/02     The Washington Post says...  "Bush and others often alleged that President Hussein held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, but did not disclose that the known work of the scientists was largely benign. Iraq's three top gas centrifuge experts, for example, ran a copper factory, an operation to extract graphite from oil and a mechanical engineering design center."    There is more of a reason to hate Bush...that's it for that...oh yea...power is back!!!....I am so glad...I don't need a fuckin generator to go on the computer...

      I hate the president...yes....I truly do...and here are some reasons why:  1. He can't read  2. He bought his way thru school  3. There is still no proof of "weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq, here is a recent column in  urlLink punk voter.com :  "For those of you not in the know, it has been recently discovered that Bush cited documents that "proved" Iraq was actively seeking materials for making a nuclear weapon. It turned out that the documents were forged. The fact that our President used false information to spur military action is unsettling to say the least; and there should be some serious inquiries as to what motivated the use false information. Clinton was fully investigated for lying about a sexual relationship, shouldn't there be an equally thorough investigation of Bush for lying to Congress about the urgency of attacking Iraq? No one ever got killed from a blowjob, but hundreds of Americans and thousands of Iraqis died as a result of Bush's fictitious war. Things have gotten so bad that even the corporate media is starting to wonder about Bush Jr.'s credibility. Here's what CNN has reported:    urlLink click here  "  -taken from  urlLink Punkvoter.com   4. He says some pretty stupid shit...for example:     "Arbolist...Look up the word. I don't know, maybe I made it up. Anyway, it's an arbo-tree-ist, someone who knows about trees."  Crawford, TX 8/21/01   "It's your money, you paid for it."  La Crosse, WI 10/18/00   "The Bob Jones policy on interracial dating, I mean I spoke out on interracial dating. I spoke out against that. I spoke out against interracial dating.

Dallas, TX 5/10/00    (Note: Yes, everybody says stupid things...but you got to admit...this is all stuff that got caught in the media...imagine how much stupid shit he says off cameras...)  5.He cut a half a BILLION dollars from the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. Who needs to look after the environment when there’s all that oil drilling going on?   6.He approved a bill that denies financial aid to students convicted of misdemeanor drug charges (though convicted murderers are still eligible for financial aid). ...it's kinda ironic seeing that he did drugs....  7.He wouldn’t sign the Kyoto Protocol agreement on global warming, which was ultimately signed by 178 other countries. He also told the entire European community that he would listen to their arguments, but he would not change his mind, effectively treating Europe like an 8 year old child. This may have something to do with why most of the world hates the US.   8.He provided every member of the Bin Laden family living in the U.S. a chartered plane shortly after 9/11 to fly back home to Saudi Arabia without questioning them. One of GW’s first petroleum venture was partnered with the Bin Laden family and George Sr. has been getting filthy rich selling defense contracts to the Bin Ladens. These are just some examples of the many ties the Bush family has with the Bin Ladens.   9. He recently sent a delegation to the UN children’s summit to declare that the use of condoms is not a valid way to fight AIDS and that abstinence is the only solution. This is the view shared by some other countries such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Syria, and the Vatican.   10. International Plan for Cleaner Energy: G-8 group of industrial nations (US, Canada, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, UK), July 2001: the US was the only one to oppose it.   11. September 2001: he withdrew from International Conference on Racism, bringing together 163 countries in Durban, South Africa   12. He refused to join 123 nations pledged to ban the use and production of anti-personnel bombs and mines, February 2001   I may be editing this with more reasons....I can't wait to see this guy out of office...I wish I could vote...Note: I got much of this info from   urlLink punkvoter.com  a site created by Fat Mike from NOFX...this has got to be the most in depth rant I have had yet....Much thanks once again to punkvoter.com.....I would be very happy if all of you that read this blog(...and that means just about nobody I bet...) learned something today...and maybe you hate the president at least a little bit....I mean c'mon...the dude can't even read....

      Me and Mike were bored, so we called Ben's house, and he wasn't home...but Rachel (his sister) invited us to hang out with her...It was fun! :)...We watched some videos on funnyjunk.com and then Brandon even came over too.  Then me, my mom, Rachel, mrs. peters, Larry, mike, and brandon played Uno.  Then we played Trivial Pursuit and me and Mrs. Peters won! *laughs* good times...good times....oh yea and being the klutz that I am...I managed to break a  plastic  cup (it cracked ok...) then I knocked over a little statue of some naked guy, and broke his head off....that was not cool...but still funny......  I quit marching band...my dad said it was ok if I got a job and started takin guitar lessons again....he just doesnt want me layin around the house all day...but thats ok...cause i wanted to do that stuff anyways....my mom says that the marching band only has one trombone player now...oh well...not my problems....why did I quit?  I got sick of it...not worth all the trouble...lost the fun that it once had...  Finished painting today!...this is the last night I am gonna sleep on the couch...woohoo!....thats uncomfortable......all that is left is rearranging my furniture in my room...and puttin on the new bedspread...well thats all thats been happenin...fuck....school is only 3 weeks away!!!!!!!!

      As I was saying before, I have been trying to scare myself silly...Nothing seemed to do it...The Exorcist didnt even do it...I wanted to jump out of my seat...feel my heart jump...Silent Hill 2 did that a little...some monsters jump out from under cars...but not really catch me by suprise and make my heart sink...so then Ben showed me this one clip and it scared the pants off of me...and it was only like 10 seconds long....You want to see it?...too bad...that would ruin the whole suprise...so maybe in the next week or so I will randomly post it...just to scare you...   But while I was at the site with the scary movie on it, I did stumble across this great film...it is very relaxing... urlLink make sure your volume is on so you can hear it.... ....It is so relaxing....  well thats all for now...adios...

        NO IT'S NOT!  .....I hate these whiny assholes that go around saying shit like, "Punk died with Sid Vicious."  No, stupidhead...punk started with Sid Vicious.... YOU CAN"T KILL OFF AN ENTIRE KIND OF MUSIC COMPLETELY .  It is impossible...there will always be some there...deep underground somewhere....Yes, punk hit the fan and now people think punk is the shit on MTV...but that doesnt mean punk is dead...that just means it is misunderstood....people don't know what punk is...they just aren't aware that the stuff on MTV isn't it....So there...I stated my point and I am done with this subject...it's so fucking stupid, it shouldn't even be argued about...its not dead!!   Punk's not dead it's sleeping...

      I had one last resort to scare myself...I rented Silent Hill 2 along with the movies....I tried it out a little while ago....turned off all the lights....get myself in the mood to be afraid....the story is quite intriguing....a man receives a letter from his wife that passed away that reads something like:  I am waiting for you in Silent Hill...in our special place.... ...so he goes out there to look for her.  The controls are weak, but the creepy noises make it worth it.  I love the idea silent hill had that a radio made a static noise when a monster was close....cause it adds such suspense...you here the static...and you are just waiting for a monster to pop out-BOOM! there it is....creepy as hell....i love that....so...the game is doing good for me....  I am sleeping on the couch tonight cause I started painting my room today! My mom and I got the sand color done...needed two coats....tomorrow we start on the bigger part...the water color...i am going for a beach theme...the sand color is rolling along the bottom ...about a foot and a half off the ground.....then there will be water color....and then use a lighter blue to make waves....it will look really cool....cause i got those water lamps i was talking about before...that have different color lights...it'll be very relaxing...  Well I am gonna wrap this up cause I have something I want to ramble about!  "Don't call me white!" -NOFX

       Song of the Day:  Flossing A Dead Horse by NOFX  Mood: pooped  Sorry no bloggin' in awhile, lots of stuff has happened, but I don't feel like typing it....I am only gonna type 'bout today.  I thought it was gonna suck today, but it turned out ok.  First, I had a conference with my history teacher and mom for my....less than perfect grades....well....that was boring, but then i had to work at the rummage sale which I thought was really gonna be boring.  Then, Marty showed up!  So, the fun started.  We did little work, and we would mainly take stuff that was sittin around and play with it.  I got a pogo stick!!  dude, and it was only 2 bux...and i am really good....Marty still needs some practice.  Then we got laser tag thingys at the rummage sale, and we ran up to Walgreens to get batteries.  My mom drove us back to his house, and we played laser tag in his yard for a little while, and then I went home.  after that, some bad stuff happened, but i dont feel like typing it, i am tired...i am gonna get something to eat, and then talk to some people...  good day today  "Why must we stay, where we don't belong?" -NOFX

All my friend's aren't going to Pajamarama...so i think i am just not gonna go as well...  I need my counselor now....  "You're not the boss of me! I'm the boss of me!" -The Vandals

      hey, long time no see, finished my Personal Narrative for english class, and I would like to share it with you...from the people that have read ot so far they said it was pretty funny.  please note that this narrative goes into the future...some of this stuff doesn't really happen...but I kinda hope it does...oh and also note...the tab button doesnt really work on this site, so thats why the paragraphs are seperated   Andrew Schultz							   Personal Narrative 1    Mr. Hebestreit English 10, 5th hour September 15, 2003                                                                               Prologue 	In the year 2077, A man turns on his TV, “let’s see what crap is on today…” He surfs through the endless reality shows including: Bachelor: Hopefully It Will Work This Time; Survivor: Mars; Fear Factor: See How Many Pig Rectums Playboy Stars Can Eat In One Minute; and the infamous, (not-so) Real World: Moscow Edition.  The man continues to flip through the channels, “Same old, same old…” Something catches his eye on the channel: E!.  He listens to the introduction:   “Next on: E!: True Hollywood Stories!  Andrew Schultz: friend, musician, and family man tells his life story once and for all, on a newly found tape he recorded before he died.  Listen to his story next!”   	“Alright!  Old what’s-his-face!  I remember that guy!  I think I got one of his old CDs up in the attic…” The man says.  He yells up to his son that is playing in his room, “Hey, Son!  You want a real history lesson!?  This guy they are doing a thing on TV was really cool back in my day!”  The man’s son yells back down, “No thanks, dad!  I am busy playing Playstation 26!”   The son says to himself, “Yea right, like I would want to see something that my lame dad was into when he was a kid…Grown-ups are so  out-of-date .”  	The dad runs into the kitchen and grabs some popcorn.  He hops down in his chair, “Oh man, it’s starting…this is going to be  ghetto-fabulous !”                           E!: True Hollywood Story:  The Lost Tape of Andrew Schultz  	I came into this world on June 10, 1988.  Supposedly, it was a “beautiful miracle of life” that was actually quite gruesome.  My mom was probably begging somebody to hit her with a bat to distract her from the pain of her “most beautiful experience of her life”.  This, I bet, was my first traumatizing experience of my interesting life.  I was born in Providence Hospital in Southfield.  However, I grew up in the boring, inescapable, h-e-double hockey stick hole we like to call: Livonia.  	I attended Hull Elementary School.  It was a very odd school that was full of teachers that either owned framed pictures of Bates, or they smoked pipes outside during recess secretly, or would chase you around the room trying to kiss you (I was actually kissed by this crazy teacher, sad to say).  I did well in school for the most part, getting A’s and B’s.  My mom-being a teacher- and my dad-being a part’s auditor for GM- made me feel the need to be a perfectionist because my mom expected good grades, and my dad just yelled a lot.  	Around the age of eight, we got a pop-up camper.  Ah yes, family bonding…(*vomits*).  We went on many trips including Yellowstone National Park and Maine.  A few of the highlights were: being cramped in either a camper or car with my sister and parents, ten hour car rides, and having to sleep next to my dad that snores a lot at night and finds much humor out of releasing of internal gases.  	I wasn’t really in to music in elementary school until I picked up a guitar in sixth grade.  I played in the elementary school band as the only guitarist.  The rest of the band included: ten clarinet players, eight keyboardists, three percussionists, three or four trumpets, one trombone, and one ukulele (yes, the little Hawaiian guitar-type instrument).  That’s right, we were a ghetto band.  I soon found myself and my other classmates moving on to middle school.  This was the time frame in which I was searching for my character and style.  	Throughout middle school, I wanted to be prep, sadly.  I followed this witty, sarcastic, self-centered bunch for a month or so until I realized they probably weren’t even smart enough to prepare a Pop-Tart© without having to read the instructions on the side of the box.  Meanwhile, I continued on the path of music by starting to play trombone in the middle school band, and I continuing to play guitar outside of school.  	My good friend, Ben Peters, played bass guitar outside of school (also the lad that played the ukulele in the said elementary school band, but he gave it up though).  We came to a conclusion that our musical talent (or lack of it) would get us nowhere fast by ourselves.  So we decided to join forces, and make a crummy band that might get us somewhere, and hopefully some girlfriends.  We had a drummer at one point, but he got kicked out for undisclosed reasons.  (As I progress through the story, keep in mind Ben and I are still trying to form a band through out it.)  So, middle school passed like a flash.  Boys and girls start turning from kids into kids that are a little taller, have cracked voices, and have curly hairs in new places.  	The summer after middle school I did marching band (big mistake).  Standing at attention for twenty minutes, marching everyday in the heat, and having to wear those stupid uniforms in front of your friends that now have pop shooting out of their noses from laughing at you were always fun experiences.  Around this time I got horrible news. 	               My parents got divorced.  Eventually, under all the stress of school, the divorce, and relationships, I drove towards the path of sex, drugs and rock and roll, without the drugs, and, unfortunately, without the sex.  I got very involved in punk, emo, and ska music in my freshman year.  I also started going to the thrift store and got my own style of clothes.  Then, some good started coming back to my life.  	Late in the freshman year, Ben and I recruited Mike Sochalski as our drummer.  We got ourselves a name for the band as well: Just For You.  As we started writing songs, I started going to counseling.  No, I wasn’t crazy (maybe a little); I was just a little overwhelmed.  	Summer came once again after ninth grade of course.  I found my first love, but promptly got dumped at the end of the summer which is always fun, as you would expect.  I also quit marching band (I loved marching around in full uniform until my feet hurt really bad, but I decided it was just time to call it quits).  With the extra time, Just For You continued to practice hard through the summer, and we got lots of songs done.  	With the sophomore year starting, I continued to distance myself from my parents.  I was convinced that if it wasn’t for my curly head of hair that I share with my mom, I was probably either adopted or dropped down on Earth by aliens (I am still trying to contact them to see if they will take me back).  I was nothing like them; I couldn’t really stand them either.  I am sure every teenager feels this way about their parents because everybody has that one parent (or both parents) that is either very odd, annoying, strict, not street smart, inappropriate, corny, embarrassing, not accepting to new technology/customs ( remember hearing this: “we don’t need digital cable!” or the classic, “Your own car?!  When we were kids we would walk fifteen miles to school, uphill both ways!”),  ill-tempered, non-internet savvy, or over-protective.  Some teenagers, like myself, have parents that have more than one of these qualities.  So, I just tried to find as many excuses as I could to get out of the house.  	In fall, my band finished our first CD.  We also started performing at small music halls, and local record stores.  People went insane for our band.  Our shows would be packed, people even having to sit outside because the fire marshal wouldn’t let anymore people in because we went over the maximum people limit of the buildings we were playing at.  Girls loved us, and guys wanted to be like us.  At school, we would be chased down for autographs, and girls would faint whenever we looked at them (and they weren’t fainting from how ugly we were like it used to be).  After sophomore year, we went on our first tour.  It was a huge success.  We covered most of the east coast of the US, and soon everybody was talking about Just For You.  	As junior year started, we opened for bands like NOFX and the Suicide Machines.  We were getting really well known, and as the junior year ended we were invited to play on the Warped Tour.  We were the youngest group to ever be on the Warped Tour, but it was because we were so good.  On the warped tour at one of our last stops, Comerica Park, I met a real cool punk chick when I jumped off the stage into the crowd, and she was one of the people that caught me and pushed me back on stage.  I met with her after the show, and we really hit it off.  	Years pass by and we got married when I was twenty-five.  We moved into a house on Lake Michigan, and started a family.  Just For You took a short break for us to get our lives together, but with the fans getting anxious for us to release another album, the band members and I finally met together, and started making music again.  	Life for me pretty much stayed the same for a long time.  Writing music, recording it, sending it out, and going on tours is all we did.  Soon, we realized we were getting to old for this when at one show I threw out my back while jumping in the air.  To the horror of our idolizing and loving fans, Just For You called it quits when I was thirty-seven.  I took the extra time to start writing books.  I wrote on politics, current events, and basically anything I had a strong opinion on.  Of course, the books sold like crazy.  While writing these books, I started my own record label: Warped Records (I don’t know if this is an actually record label already).  Many bands signed up to be on Warped Records, and it became one of the most successful record companies ever made.  	So, here I am sitting at the age of seventy-nine recording this audiocassette tape still in the house on Lake Michigan.  My life as you can now see, was very well lived and fruitful.  I hope someday somebody will hear this, and everyone will know my story.  Whoops, there goes my alarm for me to take my pills, good-bye!                                                        Epilogue The E! True Hollywood Story sums up the personal narrative:   “Then at age eighty, Andrew was driving my Corvette down the highway, speeding as usual.  He was returning from the mall where he shoplifted many things.  He knew that nobody would suspect an eighty-year-old man would steal something, and besides he didn’t have much to lose anyways.  Anyways, he was driving along on a  highway in Michigan.  Then, he hit a pothole (No, they never did fix the pothole problem in Michigan) doing about ninety miles per hour, and then he flipped my Corvette.  He died instantly.  	Millions of people mourned the loss of him that day.  His fans, his friends, his family, and even his ex-girlfriends that wished they had never dumped him back when they were teenagers.  That day was also made an international holiday, and there was no school on that day either.  Nobody ever did forget him, and all of his accomplishments.  	So, there you have it.  That is how Andrew Schultz turned from a nobody to a somebody just because he decided to pick up that guitar in sixth grade.  Feel free to go grab a tissue now to wipe away your tears of amazement.”   The man said, “that was a great documentary, and that tape of his personal narrative was amazing.”  He paused to eat more popcorn, and then he added, “I bet if Andrew Schultz turned in something like that for an English paper, he would have gotten an  A+!  Ha ha!”  (*Wink, wink, nudge, nudge*).       Please give me your thoughts on this narrative, and if there are any errors tell me ASAP, cause....it's due tomorrow...

      Everybody loves it...but it really does more bad than good.  I wish I knew how people thought I was...lol...that would be funny.  Guys would have much less of a problem asking girls out if there wasn't gossip.  I don't hate asking girls out cause of rejection,  I'm afraid of what rumors will be spread after I admit it... ...cause relationships have got to be the juiciest of the things to gossip about.  People should just stop making a huge deal of a person asking another person out, it would make things a shitload easier.  But no, we have to get involved in everybody's lives, and share opinions and usually add in stuff that probably isn't true.  Even best friends gossip about eachother...it's kinda sad really....  All I got to say to sum this rant up in one phrase:  People's crushes and love lifes are their own damn business, keep the fuck out unless you are let in.

      My mom doesn't seem to believe in this.  She has given me 3 choices for tomorrow morning:  1. Goto her church 2. Goto my sister's church 3. Goto a church of my choice  Uhm...something is missing...how about...  NOT GOING TO CHURCH ??  SHE ALREADY KNOWS HOW I FEEL ABOUT GOING TO CHURCH.  I don't like catholicism, I don't believe in going to church.  I don't need a church to pray, or know there is a god.  I have my own beliefs.  So, I left her a message on my door:   "Don't wake me up!  If you force me to go to church, you are not only unconstitutional, but you will also be disregarding my beliefs!"   Hopefully she will notice it and leave me alone.  I haven't gone to church in a long time, and I plan on keeping it that way.  Yes, it would be unconstitutional for her to make me go...it's called  freedom of religion , mom...I don't really have a set religion.  I just know there is some dude up there that is controlling things....and according to one of my counselors i went to,  that is all i need .  So, I hope my mom just leaves me alone.  Or  I am gonna have a fit.   "It's not like I don't believe in Jesus Christ, it's just I care about other things." -NOFX

      Many of the people who support Pro Life want a constitutional amendment to be passed stating life starts at conception (when egg is fertilized) and that a fetus is a human being.    Also, they believed in no exceptions for abortions.  Then, some of them changed their minds, and decided abortions were wrong  except  when the life of the mother is in danger.  Later, they changed their minds again and decided fetuses were human beings  except  when the life of the mother is in danger  and except   when she has been raped  and except  when she is the victim of incest.  Pro Life people can't seem to make up their minds on when a fetus is human or not.    Anyways, I decided that if this amendment is passed Pro Lifers (and everybody else) must agree to the following terms:  1.  Everyones age will be calculated from the day of  conception  :  So, if we are human the day the egg is fertilized then that is our birthday!  After the amendment becomes a wall we will no longer count the day the baby comes out of the womb as the birthday.  Instead, we will count back 8 or 9 months to the day of conception, adding 9 months to our age.  Well, after all we are considered "human beings" to you Pro Life people on the day of conception.  This shouldn't be a problem for you.  2. Social Security #s are issued immediatly to all fetuses:  self-explanatory.  3. Capital Punishment for all women who have abortions :  A life is a life, you should get same punishment.  38 states all ready have the death penalty for premedicated murder.  So, if fetuses are "humans" than moms that have abortions should get the death penalty...isn't that right, people that believe Pro life?  4.   Doctor who performs abortion also gets capital punishment :  He is in even deeper shit cause he is murdering "humans" for profit.   If the Right to Lifers are not willing to adopt the above proposals, then is it possible, they don't  really  believe life begins at conception and the fetus is  not  a human?  Is this whole anti-abortion movement actually not about "abortion" at all?-  but instead  about  controlling women  and  their bodies  and keeping them "in their place"?  Could it be?  I'll let you to decide.  I bet you people that are Pro Life are really thinking right now...     Downsize This! by  Michael Moore  was used as a source for this rant...a very good book   "I've got something to say, I killed your baby today." -NOFX

       First off, I am aware that doesn't rhyme well.   Haven't blogged in awhile.  What have i been up too?.......I saw Identity...very good movie.  John Cusak is a sweet actor.  It was one of those movies that has all those twists...god I love those...  Uhm...what else have I been doing.  I am of course never doing homework...not off to the best start...I find myself putting my homework aside until like...11 o clock at night.  Then, I will fall asleep before i ever get started.  So then, I am doing homework during other classes.  But, I usually don't get all of it done.  So, I really need to get off my lazy ass and start workin...  I bought two books:  Downsize This!  by  Micheal Moore  ( I felt the need to pick up one of his books after I saw  Bowling For Columbine ) and  The Bush Dyslection   by...uhm...I forgot who...and it is in my bag which is in my sis's car, and I don't feel like getting it, quite frankly...I am reading   Downsize This!   right now...It is very good so far.  What am I listening to alot?    The Queers, The Real Mckenzies, Squirtgun, Ben Folds, and The Suicide Machines  ...The Suicide Machines have been one of my main cds I play when I go out for my daily walks for several months now....I really got hooked to them.  Yes, I take walks...I get bored...so I just grab a water and my cd player and walk to the gas station or...wherever i feel like.  For my English Class we have to write a person narrative.  I am having alot of fun with that (No sarcasm...and no sarcasm in the "no sarcasm" and no sarcasm in the "no sarcasm in the 'no sarcasm'" and no sarcasm in the- *is shot*).  I really am having fun tho.  From people that have read it so far they think it is funny.  I will post it on here as soon as it is finished, k? OK.  Blah blah blah...still looking for love...blah blah blah school is stupid...blah blah blah sameoldsameold....  "It's all about money!" -The Suicide Machines

       Simply phenomenal ...all I can say about the movie:  Bowling for Columbine .  It's a documentary on why the U.S. is more violent than other countries.  It is a Michael Moore movie; a man I deeply respect for his opinions on George Bush that are much like mine.  Go rent this movie now, it will be in the new releases section.   I GOT MY REAL MCKENZIES CD!!!!  :) :)....I was takin a nap when I got home from my vacation yesterday, when my mom came upstairs and held up an envelope.  All I saw was "Fat Wreck chords" stamped on the front, and I snapped awake and ripped it open.  I got much more than what I thought I would get.  I got my Real Mckenzies cd which I ordered (and it is really good).  I also got the two posters I ordered; Nerf Herder and The Riverdales.  Then the two extra things I got was a free Comp disc of people from Fat Wreck Chords, Pink and Black Records, and Honest Don's Records.  Then I got a catalog containg a cool little comic in the front and some more stuff on George Bush in the front.  So, I was psyched about getting all that stuff :).  But I am still waiting for my Riverdale's CD to come in...  "They are droppin' like flies, all these punk rock guys." -The Real Mckenzies

       Song of the Day:  Jacket by Nerf Herder  Mood:  Stoked  I had a pretty cool weekend...in friday Just For You had a practice, and we had lots of fun like usual.  And got a shiiiiiiiiiiitload done.  Then on saturday, I went to Great Lakes Crossing with Mike, and we met his ex-girlfriend (Aly) and her friend (Kristen) there to see a movie.  But it took forever to find them LOL....while we was waitin I bought a gnarly pair of slip-on Vans. >_ _  sorry...i have been doing no rants...I have been blogging less and less...i dunno...i will try to post more often...but yea...i'm doing pretty good...HALF DAYS ARE COMING UP...I can't wait...I love having less of school...but then again..who doesn't?

       Song of the Day:  My Own Flag by Less Than Jake  Mood:  Sleepy  Thanksgiving day weekend...would have been anxious for it to come if I had anything cool planned, I did't so it sucked.  On Thanksgiving I visited relatives and stuff...then Friday I went and saw The Missing with my dad (probably the highest part of my weekend).  Then the crazy drama started.  Marty liked the girl I liked, then I thought she liked him as well...I wasn't very happy...I did nothing all saturday, and then Sunday came and I found out she didn't like Marty.  That was cool.  Then me and Marty got talking and we decided we didn't want a girl to get inbetween a good friendship and possibly break up Just For You... again ...so we decided to forget about her...but it turns out she liked this other guy more than me so...it all worked out...except Marty and I are back at square one with no girlfriends...  Oh well, looks like I'll have to go searching again...Oh wait I have more good news.  I got my tickets to the Suicide Machines concert! I can't wait :)...and my mom said I could go if I showed her my math homework from now till the concert (my math grade isn't too hot).  I also can go to my cousin's new band's 1st concert this friday under the same circumstances...that won't be too bad, better than not being able to go at all...yea, I think I can do my math homework for once haha...

       Song of the Day:  Kill Your Name- My Friend Ehab  Mood:  Looking Up  yea, haven't blogged in a long time.  I tried the livejournal thing for a little bit, but I ended up liking blogger better.  Anyways, a shitload of stuff has been happening.  I am probably going to my cousin's band Designed by You first concert on Friday.  It should be intense...his other band 9 Miles 2 Go got on an Asian Man Record compilation awhile ago, and it has sold over 20,000 copies.  The guitarist quit, so the bass player moved to guitar and vocals, and my cousin filled in the bass spot.  They haven't updated their site in awhile so my cousin isnt on it yet.  There producer wants to send them to New York to record and he will pay for everything...lucky...Their producer is the same guy that made Verve Pipe big, they had that song on the radio awhile ago that went, "we were merely freshman" or something.  Then on the 20th is the Suicide Machines concert that is gonna be the concert  of the century! Fordirelifesake is gonna be there, and they are pretty good, but The Suicide Machines will kick ass.  As for the band, Mike got kicked out, and Marty Layne is now the bass player and Ben moved to drums.  We are gonna record and EP soon, and hopefully do a small show in 2 weeks.  check out the  urlLink site.  and sign the guestbook.  This weekend I might see this girl Aimee from Novi, she's really cool.  The girl I was talking about in my last post from like a month ago, turned out to be a whore/druggie.  And you know...that isnt too good...  Me and my dad are gonna go see The Missing soon...so cya!  "Life gets harder everyday, I'll do my best to show up." -Nobody Care

      Great cd.  If you are a real fan to Screeching Weasel this is a good collecter's cd.  It is simply a compilation of Screeching Weasel's greatest songs after they broke up.  It features songs including "I wanna be a Homosexual", "Hey Suburbia", and "Girl Next Door".  If you like Screeching Weasel, but you are unsure of what CD to get, this is a great cd to introduce you to them (this is my first Screeching Weasel cd).  And if you already have a thriving Weasel collection this cd includes live songs and several pages of their history in the pamphlet included.  Plus, wouldn't you like to listen to your favorite Screeching Weasel songs without having to switch CDs?  Overall Grade: A

      I decided to start reviewing music CDs I get, cool huh? anyways, on with the critiquing!  I wasn't too excited when I got the Blink 182 cd for X-mas, I haven't listened to them in awhile.  One thing is for sure, they definitly turned to their emo side.  A really interesting about "Feeling this" is that Mark went into a seperate room and wrote the chorus, and Tom went into a seperate room and wrote the verses, they had no idea what eachother was writing about...it turns out they both wrote about sex, and Tom wrote about the physical part, and Mark wrote about the romantic part, so the song is very interesting.  I must say that is a very cool idea, and the outcome was a very good song...quite addicting as well...  One of the things I am pleased they did was the exploitation of Travis's drumming abilities.  There are several drum solos through out the cd.  Travis is god on the drums.  To me he seems like he would be to a drummer what Flea would be to a bassist.  I am displeased with the lack of any just plain funny songs.  There attitude in those songs just make you want to laugh, and there are none of those on this cd.  I am also displeased with Track #7 which was produced by some rap guy, and all it is is a rap beat over and over again...it sickened me...  If anybody dares scream sell out at Blink 182, they should should shoot themselves because they sold out awhile ago, and not in the bad way.  Some people seem to forget that musicians do not stop learning once they are in a band.  Blink 182 shows that they have gained much talent during their long pause since Take Off Your Pants And Jacket.  If you want to use the "Sell-Out" card, lean towards Good Charlotte, who have no music ability and..well...that's a different story...  Overall, Blink 182 has gained a new sound, but not necassarily a bad one.  There lyrics are still addicting as ever, but they lost the funny attitude they once had.   Overall Grade:  B

      holy shit, my mom got a juicer for X-mas, and I cannot stop juicing things...the juice itself tastes like shit, but the process is very amusing.  Shredding things into nothing but juice (and the pulp all stuck to the sides of it...gory...>:)  ) is very exhilirating...  excuse me, i must juice more things...

       Song of the Day:  Hey Suburbia by Screeching Weasel  Mood:  Bursting with joy  Ignore my last entry, this may have been one of my best X-mases to date.  Sorry, I haven't posted in awhile...Just haven't felt like it, but let me update you on everything that has happened.  Just For You broke up :(.  But me and Marty are starting a side project called A Burning Reason (see links).  We really need a drummer though...  On Saturday I went to The Suicide Machines annual X-mas show...it was no doubt the best concert I have been to.  First, Half the Battle and Fordirelifesake played.  They were both amazing.  Everybody was hardcore dancing in the pit though...I don't like hardcore dancing too much...Then a band called the Rivercity Rebels played.  Imagine the Clash with a trombone and tenor saxophone.  Despite what some other people said, I really liked them.  Then, the highlight of the evening...THE SUICIDE MACHINES... they are better than I imagined live.  I crowd surfed 4 times (dropped once lol :P )...I can't remember to which songs, but I think Break the Glass was one of them.  Before I surfed, I was up front, and Marty and I yelled into the microphone and stuff when Jason Navarro leaned over the crowd.  The pit was very fun and friendly, lots of skanking, lots of love...  Here was the highlight of that evening...afterwards I discovered a couple of unguarded doors leading somewhere from the side of Clutch Cargos, me and marty went in, and found ourselves in the backstage area...we talked to the bass player from Fordirelifesake, and then I saw my cousin Kevin back there who already had a backstage pass because he has known the Suicide Machines for like 6 years.  He lead me to all the members of the Suicide Machines and I got all their autographs!! :)...(the ticket stub with the autographs are already framed lol)  I got a lot of cool shit for X-mas:  -Tony Hawk's Underground for PS2  -XIII for PS2  -The Greatest Story Ever Told by the Lawrence Arms  -Washed up and Through the Ringer by Catch 22  -Dinosaur Sounds by Catch 22  -Kill The Musicians by Screeching Weasel  -Nokia Cell Phone (734-968-2200) :-P  -SOCKS!!! YES!!!  -A calvin and Hobbes book  -An Onion book  -sour patch kids  -batteries  -pencils lol  -A cool circle like chair (space style thing, i cant describe it...)  Then there was today when Kate came over at 12 :)  We hung out till 8:00.  I love that girl like...like...alot...I couldn't think of anything sweet...sorry....so now I am just sitting here reflecting on the good time I had :)  Tomorrow Marty is gonna spike Alana's hair I think...I told him to tell me when so I can come watch...and maybe take pictures :P...That would be insanely tight if she went through with it...  Well...I am having a very good vacation at this point...let the good times roll! bye bye :)  "Hey suburbia, hey surbia, hey suburbia, we're in love with you..." -Screeching Weasel

       Song of the Day:  I hate everything by the Suicide Machines  Mood:  Pissed  I’m pissed, this week sucks, this month sucks…I got all this fucking homework, and I just don’t want to do it anymore, but my fucking parents won’t ease up on the grades, I can’t get a C even.  Now I have nothing to do, the one thing I enjoyed most was band practice but now we are going on a break…I forget why….now I got nothing going, so I sit on my ass not feeling like doing anything…I called Ben to see if he feels ready to practice yet, and he wasn’t home yet, and his sister said she would tell him.  This isn’t the first time I left a message for Ben and I never got a call back…in fact there are more times that I never got a call back then when I did get a call back.  Whose fault?  I have no idea…but it is fucking stupid.  Now Marty is being a jerk, I asked if he could call Ben  cause I didn’t want to pester him, but “that would mean he would have to get up to get the phone”…god…sometimes I don’t feel like I got anything to live for, well, ever since Ben decided to take this break….I got a lot of math, and biology…DAMMIT I hate Richardson soooo much.  Sometimes I just want to yell out in her class, “BOOOORING!!!!!”  She just drones on and on and on, it drives me insane, and I can’t sleep cause she yells at me.  But I guess I am happy cause X-mas is coming…  Not really…I don’t want anything, if I could have anything it would be for Just For You to plan something, and then actually follow through with it…all that happens is pushing back, pushing back, pushing back…..  Oh and a girlfriend would be nice, but whatever…  Oh yea, and this is gonna be my first Christmas with a broken home…many tears to come…  Merry fucking Christmas…  "I hate everything, fuck you." -suicide machines

       Song of the Day:  Perpetua and Felicitas by Alucard  Mood : The good kind of achy  Wow, last night was a blast.  Me and Marty headed out to a Knights of Colombus to go see my cousin's band's first show.  They are called  urlLink Designed by You .  Up first was a band called Based On A True Story, and then Flatline, and then Silence of Wake.  They were all really good.  I think it was Flatline that copied off of the Suicide Machines, i dunno, but one of them did, they split the crowd into two and then when he counted to 4 we rushed at eachother braveheart style.  I was up front.  It was a blast.  My cousin's band was up then.  They were sweet.  Nice stuff to skank and then mosh too.  Then there were two bands after them that werent that good.  Then there was Alucard.  They are so good, I got one of their CDs.  In their mosh pit I got a fat lip.  It was so sweet.  The bad part of the show was that there were these gay kids jumping off eachother into the moshpit.  One of them hit Marty right in the face with an elbow.  I saw that and scooped Marty right up and got him off to the side.  He was shaken but OK, he's like an ox, he moshes like crazy haha...but we were pissed at those kids cause they would hit you from behind running full blast when nobody was moshing.  We wanted to hit the guy that was jumping off his friends in midair so he would fall flat on his face, but they didnt do it anymore.  My fat lip is gone, but there is a sweet scab there. heh...just relaxing this weekend now I guess. peace  "With looks so good but flaws so bad." -Alucard

       Song of the day:  Don't Say Goodbye by From Here On Out  Mood:  weary  I forgot to mention my uncle Bob moved in with us.  He is staying in the basement on a fold-out bed. He is staying with us cause he is going through a divorce...but here's the really sweet part: he's been playing guitar since he was even younger than i started, and he has a whole collection of guitars.  Right now he has a Tacoma acoustic here, and it is a very rare one.  And the other day he just brought over a Regal acoustic.  It has a metal grill type thing where the hole on the acoustic would be, and then there are two metal holes near that, sorat looks like two very small metal speakers built in...it's hard to explain, but it has an amazing tone.  Also he brought his very first acoustic/electric 12 string with him.  It is an old Medallion, and he said if I could fix it up I could have it!  I just need to hook the pickup back on and change the strings.  It's only Tuesday, and I am swamped with homework.  We have a history test coming up and that is when we have to turn in our notes we did on the 2 to 3 chapters we covered....too bad nobody does the notes.  It's hilarious we all do the notes a day or two before they are due.  But it's gonna be hard cause I got a concert tomorrow.  Our first band concert...god...it's at a fucking mall....it's gonna be stupid....i really don't want to go...but i have to or else I will lose alot of points.   Thursday I think I will be over the stress I have from pre-history-test homework  cause that is when the test is, and that is when Just For You is gonna practice probably.  I was really bummed about not having practice today...I really look forward to Tuesday practices cause it keeps me happy throughout the week.  That's why I feel weary and weird today...I want this week to be over...X-mas vacation is soon...oh shit and I am going to my cousin's concert this Friday! it's gonna be sweet.  Well, that's what's been going on....I am gonna go work on my history notes...get a head start...and maybe study for biology...I really hate biology...well just the teacher...Richardson...she's such a bitch...her voice is unbarable, it's like nails on a chalkboard, and she repeats everything 1843021940295702 times, and the only people she likes are the stupid preppy pom pom whores, cause that's what she probably was in high school.  anyways, history now, cya  "why should I even try to tell you it will be alright?" -From Here On Out

      Song of the Day: Raw and Searing Flesh by The Lawrence Arms Mood: Silly     My life is rated R.  What is your life rated?    lol, I am as suprised as you are...trust me, it is barely R, like if a couple scenes were deleted my life would be PG-13...  so yea, not much happening...my uncle moved in with us completly which is cool.  He has a PA system and a bunch of guitars.  He is also extremly anti-Bush.  He went to an anti-war thing the other day, and in a couple months he is gonna do some sort of march to DC against the war.  We got to talking politics and guitars and stuff, and it was pretty cool.  Just want this damn week over, and stop snowing agh! lol I opened my sis's car door today and all this snow came on my head :( I wasn't happy.  Oh yea, and I went to Kate's on Tuesday and me and her and her sis and her mom played Scrabble.  It was really fun, and I think I won (I am a Scrabble veteran cause my grandma is like a scrabble junkie and it affected everybody, she knows all the two letter words and shit.  Like "xi" yea, xi is a word, it is a type of sloth.  She is nuts, I tell ya).   Kate was very proud of her add on to my "tan" to spell "satanic" even though it only got 10 points lol.  Good times.  that's all for now.  "I'd never want to see you in the raw and searing flesh." -The Lawrence Arms

       Song of the Day:  Stockholm Experience by Blink 182  Mood : Walking on clouds  "You seem like you are riding on clouds now" My counselor said, "When you first came in here I never would expect that you could act like this"  yea, I have been happy lately, I guess I am finally getting a break....  Here is a summary of each of my new teachers for the new Semester:   Teets:  My dear lord, what an uptight, conservative, strict, predictable person.  This is gonna be a hard class.  I dropped down to Algebra hoping I would get a better teacher, I think I got a worse one.  The material is so easy, but she makes it very hard with homework formats and hw quizzes...hw quizzes?? christ...I think i will make it though... Overall Grade for teacher: D+ Required Grade to keep my ass: B- or higher Expected Grade: anywhere between a C to B…I hope I can pull off a B  Meloche: I always did good in science classes, this class should be easy.  Homework is laid back…only problem is required organization.  I think I can pull it off though.  Meloche seems like a nice guy.  He talks a lot though, and he sometimes starts screaming for no reason…like he talks extremely loud….I don’t think he notices it.… Overall Grade for Teacher: B+ Required Grade to save my ass: B- or higher Expected grade: B to an A, I do decent in science classes as I said before  Sheperd: Good atmospohere…I like the piñatas.  She seems sort of old. But she is full of energy, and she seems sorta linient on stuff…I do good in Spanish too Overall Grade For Teacher: B Required grade to save my ass: B- or higher Expected Grade: B or A  Eddy: Had her last semester, hard class, but I have a good time in her class. Overall Grade for Teacher: B+ Required grade to save my ass: C or higher Expected Grade: C or B  5th hour I have wind ensemble…easy…  Windle: Windle actually isn’t there…we have this substitute, but Kate tells me she is better than Windle.  She does seem better.  I have some kids I dislike in the class, and some I don’t mind…but she seems lenient on hw and such… Overall Grade for Techer: A- Required Grade to save my ass: B- or higher Expected Grade: B or A, I do good in English  Yea, I was pretty bored lol….  Kate was in a bad mood today :( It wasn’t my fault for all I know, but I still felt bad that she was feeling upset.  I went to Westbourne market and bought her a pink rose, and wrote a little message in it for her, and I went to her house and surprised her with it :).  She is feeling better to say the least :). Yay!  Oh I also bought some peanut M&Ms because her little sister was on the computer one time, and I really wanted to talk to Kate, so I told her I would get her any candy she wanted if she got off.  I called later after I left her with the rose and M&Ms and when she gave the M&Ms to her sister she said she was very excited and she said “I like him” lol…cute…oh yea, and Kate looked really cute in her pajama bottoms ;) lol I really did catch her by surprise when I came over…I know it’s past 9 which should be DKT, but she has soccer :( so she isn’t home…pooh…  No real plans this weekend except for doing something with Kate, I hope I can have some sort of band practice on one of the days…that would be fun….bye bye  “This is the first! (thing I remember) Now it’s the last! (thing left on my mind)” -Blink 182

Then sunday nothing happened, and then on Monday nothing really happened again.  Then today me and Kate went to the coffee bean.  I got some black cherry italian thing that tasted bad and she got a peach smoothie that tasted good so i kept stealing it lol.  There was a puppy there too loL! he was cool.  Then we went back to my house and watched TV and chilled...It was a good way to finish off the long weekend...yea...we had no school today or yesterday.  FINALS ARE OVER, HOLY SHIT THANK GOD.  yea, so much stress is off of me now.  Music? well, Sam (a drummer I sent an e-mail to awhile ago about joining A Burning Reason) contacted me today, and I think we are gonna set up a jam time, if that is ok with Marty.  Also, I have another project that is not going to be advertised at all...all I am gonna say is be prepared to see alot of old faces, and it is gonna be a very fun time.   Shit, it's 9:09, After 9 is my DKT (Designated Kate Time) since my cell phone gets free minutes after 9.  So, I am gonna go call her, and then a new fresh semester tomorrow...things are looking up! :)  "Why don't you admit? You don't have the balls to be a quuueeeerr."

      This is my first Pennywise CD and the reason i got this one cause it came with a free DVD of them, and it wasnt 18 bucks, so i went for it....anyways...now I am gonna tell you what I think of it...  First off, the front cover is so great...I really like it (see it  urlLink here )  Basic political message...I like those...which leads into the next thing...  Politics...this cd has a strong view on each song...I think only 1 or 2 are not about the government...however...there is only so much songs you can write on the world...some songs to be the extremely similar...one thing is clear...the war and 9/11 hit these boys hard...  The sounds is pretty good, fast palm muting minor scale songs with more of a poppy type vocals...I think it would be better if there we some screaming hardcore type stuff...it would fit in more....  Some of the songs I particularly liked were "Yesterdays" (addicitive melodic intro...nice piano part in the middle...solid song), and I also liked "God Save the USA" (good lyrics...sometimes a little to broad...nice background vox)   It's a pretty good CD, I certainly don't regret buying it, but I get sort of the feeling they threw this CD together real fast...some songs sound similar thats all...   Overall Grade:  B-

        Your soul is bound to the  Solitary Rose : The Alone.   "When I wake up alone, the shades are still drawn on the cold window pane so they cast their lines on my bed and lines on my face."   The Solitary Rose is associated with loneliness, melancholy, and patience.  It is governed by the goddess Merope and its sign is The Sword, or Unrequited Love.  As a Solitary Rose, you may be summed up as a hopeless romantic.  You desire love and have so much love to give, but thing just never seem to work out the way you want them to.  In life, you can be very optomistic, even when things are gray and nothing works out to your expectations.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      I usually label myself as somewhat of a hopeless romantic.

      Song of the Day: Aborted by The Rivercity Rebels Mood: Tired  I found a shitload of my cds I have been missing, I thought they were at my dad's but it ends up they were at my mom's.  I didn't have my Rivercity Rebels cd, or my Squirtgun cd, or any of my Suicide Machines cds :o.    Check this out: benihana856 (8:22:27 PM): and Mark, Mike, and Chris ( the label runners ) all said that there gonna make us the next big thing  Yes, there has been something secret going on, a littler project.  And we already are in the process of writing songs that may be on a mix cd of a record label  before the end of the month.   I don't want to say much more about this project untill we finish the recordings.  I went to a Before I Go/Half the Battle concert last night.  It was pretty cool.  I saw some people I knew and some people I hated.  The floor was all wet, so the pit was dangerous, so I didn't stay in it for long.  Somebody threw up in the sink of the bathroom. yuck!  The first band was scary.  They had face paint and a red light for the background and played really hardcore shit.  I didn't like them too much.  But I got a Before I Go EP which came with a poster.

       Song of the day:  Flossing A Dead Horse by NOFX  Mood:  Bored  I don't know why i am even writing something, nothing has happened really, life's been dull.  Somebody noticed one of my flyers and called, he said he was 23 and looking for a guitarist (I didn't put my age on the flyer, that seems like the only way I will get replies).  I told him my age and he said it was "irrelevant" and to call on Tuesday to have a practice.  I called yesterday several times and nobody picked up, and today as well, still no one picked up.  So once again my efforts turn into a disappointment :(.  I hope something turns up, I'm getting sick of shit not working.  I saw Secret Window with Kate, and it was a good movie.  Depp's character sleeps thru like the whole thing and he has bed head alot and it is funny...well...at least we thought so...  Oh yea, I got a weird IM, some girl IMed me and said, "you dont know who i am but i think you are really hot"  That's a first.  It turned out to be my girlfriend's bestfriend's cousin that just happened to see a picture of me.  Kinda creepy.  My dad yelled at me about the phone bill.  It doesnt seem like i am using that much minutes up though on my phone.  But I am gonna try to cut back.  He said I had 3000 minutes this month.  No, not 300, 3000 minutes.  I dont know where those numbers came from, but I think he is reading the thing wrong.  I'm gonna go, adios.

        You are the grammar Fuhrer. All bow to your authority. You will crush all the inferior people under the soles of your jackboots, and any who question your motives will be eliminated. Your punishment is being the bane of every other person's existence, because you're constantly contradicting stupidity. Everyone will be gunning for you. Your dreams of a master race of spellers and grammarians frighten the masses. You must always watch your back. If only your power could be used for good instead of evil.    urlLink   What is your grammar aptitude?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla        Your wings are  BROKEN  and tattered. You are an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for one reason or another - possibly, you made one tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't commit. In any case, you are faithless and joyless. You find no happiness, love, or acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most days are a burden and you wonder when the hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching picture. You are the one that few understand. Those that do know you are likely to love you deeply and wish that they could do something to ease your pain. You are constantly living in memories of better times and a better world. You are hard on yourself and self-critical or self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved, you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite your tainted nature, your soul is breathtakingly beautiful.

       Song of the Day:  Catch 22 (cant remember the name)  Mood:  bored  Nothing....same shit, different day. well...maybe to me it is, but I will share some  occurences   to you, that just so happened to come into my life.  Go to Vans.com,  urlLink bitch  and design your own custom slip-ons.  I did, and I ordered them, and they will be here in 3 to 5 weeks! :)  They are pink and black checkered. so hell yea to that.  Well, as I said before nothing has been happening in my...erm...musical career?  So I decided to go out and look for a band instead of trying to form one with friends.  I started putting flyers up and I grabbed a few numbers as well.  The first one didnt work out, but I called this guy in Jeremy from Bloomfeild Hills, and he is a drummer looking for a pop punk type band (listed on his flyer were: NOFX, The Descendents, Blink 182).  I had to ask marty if he was up to it, but he also asked if we were serious about this, and I said yea, and that I have been trying to get serious for the past couple years, but alot of previous band members were just too....well...I don't want to get mean...anyways...I said yea, and then he said he is currently leaving another band and he just needs to finish recording things for his producer (he is 15 I will add, so this kid is serious).  He said not this week but next week he will be able to practice.  So me, marty and jeremy are gonna practice next weekend, and hopefully we will have more luck than previous bands.  Mine and Kate's 3 month is in two days :) and congratulations to ben and megan to making it to the big one year :-O.  adios  "Chin up, Chin up, until it touches the moon, it's you i'm talking to" -Catch 22

      (Note: I wrote this one awhile ago, I couldn't publish it till now >_   Song of the Day:  Hello, Goodbye by the Beatles  Mood:  Sick  There is a bug going around and I guess I caught it.  Stuffy nose, sinus infection, scratchy throat, and headaches is what I got.  Woohoo! Fun… >_  Haven’t blogged in awhile, cuz I just haven’t, so there.  Catch you up on some shit:  I went to Florida for the band trip.  That was really fun, but the rides were pretty lame.  However, everynight we saw some type of firework/laser show and those were spectacular.  How do they do that!? That must take a really long time to time everything perfectly, and none of the fireworks go off early by accident, it’s crazy.  It was nice to get somewheres warm.  Getting off the plane back in Michigan in shorts really stunk >_  Music outside of school has been really slow for me.  I haven’t touched my guitar in at least 2 weeks.  I think I might have mentioned doing something with Ben before, yea, that is still happening but it is going really slow.  We can’t fit eachother’s schedule’s so it is tough.  Kate n’ mine’s two month was yesterday.  Thought I would throw that out there.  She is at her friend’s house now, and we probably are gonna do something Sunday, but I guess you don’t really give two shits about that.  My academics are rising.  I raised my math grade to an 87  O_O  yea, ms. Teets is being a bitch and giving detentions out if homework is not finished.  Well, at least I am getting my homework done now.  Last time I checked I had a 97% in Biology, and I am proud of that.  The only grade I am really worried about is History, I am too scared to even check what it is.  I missed a lot of homework, plus the tests are hard as hell…  I might have mentioned this before, but the people that write the tests are college professors and they make it so that they try to trick you.  You know how in multiple choice there usually is one obviously wrong answer, two answers that are similar to the correct answer, and one correct answer?  Well for these tests they usually have one wrong answer, two answers that ARE correct, and one answer that is the MOST correct.  So you have 3 right answers of the 4, and you need to know which one is most correct.  So you can come out of the tests thinking you did great, and then realize you were right, but you actually were wrong…get it? No? Me either.  My mom is getting the vaporizer for me and cough medicine (yuk) for me.  Then I am gonna go to bed and get lots of rest and hopefully get better.  “You say goodbye, and I say hello…hello, hello! Don’t know why you say goodbye I say hello.”

       Song of the Day:  MINE!  Mood:  Sad (Dreary Sunday)  I was on Newgrounds bored, and I stumbled upon this thing: urlLink Punk-O-Matic .  I clicked on it thinking it would be shit, but this game is amazing.  Ok, you make your own punk music from a selection of sound clips (good clips).  You choose what the drums do and what two guitars do. (No bass, but hopefully this guy will make another one with bass in it).  If you are a guitar player you will see how in-depth it is.  The characters playing your music don't just move repititionally, they move to the chords you hear in each clip.  Plus, after you are done, you can save your songs and also share them.  Here are two songs I did, all you need to do is hit the 'load' button, and put one of these in the space provided:  Song 1:   --680---0---6-5-5-5-573---9-5-9---9-6-0---0---2---2--701280---0---9---9--------------1---1---1-----------6-5-5-3-3-4---4---0---0---2---2-------1---1---a---c------------------3-3-2-4---3-3-2-4-3-3-5-4-a-------3-3-2-4-a---a-------3-3-2-4-a---a--------------  Song 2:  780---0--73---3--80---0-6-9-----6-1---1---6-9------------------------------------------9---9---a---a---9---0---------6-9---9---a-c------------------------------------------6-5-6-5-a-------6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-6-5-a-a----------------------------------------   Also while you create your songs, the game plays bands like Lagwagon, NOFX, and Bad Religion in the background.  This will definitly keep you busy when you are bored.  This has to be the most in-depth music generator I played online.  Besides that, nothing much has been going on.  I have a feeling Ben doesnt really want to do the band anymore.  I am desperate to get there and just have some fun.  I have been trying for years to get a band started.  I put a flyer up in Joe's Music advertising myself.  Hopefully something will come up.  I need something to do in my free time. And I have been wanting to do this for a long time.  I got alot of homework to do :( My mom wants me to do all the asignments i was too lazy to do :( I have to make up like 8 assignments in History...Damnit...  I'm at my dad's, this is the only place I can blog now with my madre's computer fucked up. So I havent been able to blog in awhile.

      Song of the day: Franco-Unamerican by NOFX Mood: Excited but sad  Tomorrow is gonna suck and be fun at the same time.  Suck: Practice AP test at 7:30 in the morning, till 11:30.  I think I am gonna hate this more than the actual test.  No motivation, i would be pumped if it were the real test, but it will jsut be really really dull tomorrow  Good: See Kate afterwards and then the 9miles2go concert  We got a new drummer Evan Beck, and he seems enthusiastc.  He wanted to practice today but I had work, also, his brother has a pro studio. Sweet.  And Marty says he is really good.  Tank (guy from work) is in a band called The Distance Between Stars, it is a pretty odd name, but here is the  urlLink site  anyways.

Mike quit the band...I kinda saw it coming though so...yea...now I have bit of a dilemna, I need a drummer...again...Marty is gonna ask Evan Beck and I will ask around.  I really have bad luck with bands I guess...maybe I should give up...  of course I wont tho...  or will i..?  "The world is spinning out of control!

       Music:  Avenged Sevenfold  Mood:  Lost and Frusterated  Marty let me borrow his Avenged Sevenfold cd for my Destruction of Definition by Suicide Machines cd, they are hardcore/metalcore.  Did a band practice today...we accomplished some I guess.  By the way, the name of the band is After Hours.  I am very frusterated at how we get distractred so easily.  I probably need to cut practice time to an hour or an hour and a half.  We know the songs pretty much, but sometimes we fall apart.  I really would be embaressed if we went to my cousin's and we didnt have these songs down.  When we start practiocing we usually get about a half hour of some good work down, but then everybody goes off on these tangents for ideas for new songs, or changing new songs.  I'm trying to get the guys to understand that we dont have time for that.  We might have time to work on one more song, but we really need to work on these songs and get them like the back of our hand so we dont look like idiots.  I tell them this too, but i cant seem to get them to listen...I dont really want to push it either, cause then the whole thing will fall apart, and I am sick of bands not working and breaking up just when we are about to get something done.  So far I have a couple of solutions:  1. short 1 hour practices, short, but gets us time to get stuff done, and not get distracted.  2. after the AP test, two practices a week, and of course short practices  These are only ideas...I want to have some fun, but still get stuff done.  If you have any ideas write a comment.  Dont freak out band members and quit and shit, I'm just kinda frusterated, and I want to share some ideas....

      How come I have the feeling my friends are running around back-stabbing me, talking about me, and just plain hating me..?  I look around and I see eyes looking at me, no respect or love in them, smirking and looking at me...as if i am a joke...

      Well, all you livonia suburbanites must know about Bates and how they make the tastiest fast food burgers in town, right?  Anyways, there seems to be a growing problem there...There isn't enough space for people...usually if I go there on a saturday or something all the seats are taken and I have to wait till some people get up to get some food.  If you havent been there, there is about 15-20 seats there, which is hardly enough to accomodate the customers, but I am not really mad at Bates, there is no cheap way they could solve this problem.  But I think some people should really wise up, notably the stupid asses that feel the need to bring their whole 6 member family to bates and take up about half of the seats.  If you have a large party that wants Bates, do us all a favor and order it to go.  Also, after people are done eating they cannot seem to get their asses up.  I know, everyone should be comfortable and take their time, but think about the people who want to eat and have to wait for people to get up.  If you are done eating please finish up the conversation so we can get a chance to eat.  Anyways, I've written way too much on something that is really stupid.  But it's not like anybody reads this anyways...i dont think...

       Song of the Day:  Letting the Hate Speak For Itself by Daniel  Mood : Sore  This weekend was pretty eventful.  Hung out with Kate till like 6:30, then walked over to the rec center for the battle of the bands.  OK, here were some things that sucked about it: 1. The damn little kids thinking they are so hardcore.  Then they freak out as soon as the big guys jump in.  2. The first band, Literi Fatali or something, they sucked and they had a stupid ass shirt that had a pic of a bloody wrist and under it says "cause chicks dig scars"...sick fucks...  3.  The reprocessed crap screamo band, Fool of Fortune  4. The security people not letting me and marty have any fun cause of the little kids.  We could mosh.  There were some very good highlights of the evening though:  1. The band Daniel, they were good  2. Fool of Fortune not even placing  3. Paul Knorp falling in the mosh pit and then curling into the fetal position  4. When this huge ass kid knocked down three kids at once.  5. teaching little kids a lesson in the pit  Yea, anyways, it was a decent show, but definitly not worth 7 fucking dollars. At the end me and marty rolld down the hills outside and asked the cops what time it was and they said 12:10 but later on when my mom picked us up it was only 10:30. What the fuck?  Anthrophobic Youth (winners of Battle of Bands in october or something) did not play.  I have been hearing alot of stuff about Derek McMullen lately, supposedly he went to a Faith meeting (christian after school gathering thing) and they hypnotized him and now he morphed into this pure person, church every week, cut his mohawk off, the works.  I dont know if I believe it, but I think that is funny as hell if its true.  After that I went to bed and woke up and went to work.  I have several nicknames now.  The dishwashers call me Jerry.  The waitresses call me Afro Joe and one girl calls me Jack because I guess I look like Jack Osbourne? uh ok...  This weeks schedule: monday: after school study thing tuesday: something with kate like usual wensday: after school thing, and then practice around 4 or 5 thursday: work friday: work saturday: 9miles2go concert? sunday: probably work  my schedule has been so fucking tight latly, once this AP test thing is over I will be more open though...  Ok, apparently my cousin was waiting in line for the Suicide Machines concert last night early.   Jay (lead singer of SM) comes out and Ben (my cousin) follows him to his car and asks him to listen to his Designed By You cd and possibly consider him for the annual X-mas show if he likes it.  Jay says, fuck that, lets listen to it now.  So he plays it in his car and says he likes it and sees no reason why he wouldnt be able to play in the X-mas show....is that insane or what?  Ben is pretty lucky, that would be a dream for me to play with the Suicide Machines.  But if he gets in for the X-mas show, I definitly am going.  Also, I guess my mom's friend's Cousin is the lead singer of Less Than Jake.  My mom's friend is a teacher and she is 23 and she likes the Suicide Machines (would that be a kick ass teacher to have in elementary school or what?).  My mom told her how I liked Suicide Machines, then she told my mom to tell me about her cousin who is the lead singer of Less Than Jake.  Pretty cool.  Anyways, it is late and I still have homework to do.  Also, if you want to see some possible logos for the band I am working on IM me on AIM.  Peace.

       Song of the Day:  Sayanara, Senorita by Reel Big Fish  Mood:  Relieved  Today my mom kept the air conditioning off and just kept the windows open.  I liked this alot even tho it was uncomfortable because it reminded me of the summer, and that the cold was finally gone (I hope).  I realize how close summer is now and I am excited.  Like two more months >_  Spring Break gave me lots of sleep.  Today was the last day to sleep in, and I slept in till 3.  Once this AP test is over with, it will be smooth sailing.  I am also relieved cause I dont have math homework.  yes!!  I have to catch up in math tho, I slacked off as soon as I got my report card cause I did so well, so I stopped doing homework again....stupid I know....  If I get a band practice for tomorrow my week will be full, the first time that has happened in awhile.  Here is what I would be looking at: Monday- Band practice  Tuesday- Review foir AP test after school and seeing  Kate  Wensday- Another After school review  Thursday- work: 5-8  Friday-work:4-10  I get my first paycheck this week, and I am excited, I really want the money I am so glad I got a job, now I can easily pay my phone bill, and I can start saving up for some real hot shit. Perhaps a PA system?  Sounds good.  Suicide Machines concert this saturday, and I just confirmed that Marty wants to go and can go if he can ride with me.  All I need to do is get my ticket and I will be ready to rock.  Then on May 1st there is a 9miles2go concert I want to go to, at that concert I guess they are releasing their new EP with the song   urlLink "Bitter Ending"  .  So, I would also like to go to that concert.  Well, I am just gonna relax and savor my last day of Spring Break.  Peace.

       Music of the day:  Alucard  Mood:  wiped  Went to the detroit zoo today with Kate :).  The red pandas were really cute and so were the monkeys :).  We went on this motion simulator ride for 4 bucks and it sucked.  Also the train wasnt open for the season yet :( I still had alot of fun.  Tomorrow I got no work so I am going to Peking Buffet with her.  There wasnt a band practice at all this break.  My schedule was fucked up cause of work.  Sorry, but I will schedule something next week (talking to bandmembers).  Plus, Marty wasnt home yet.    Work is cool.  It's not hard, and it isnt too bad of an environment.  My nickname is Jerry cause when a guy gets a perm it's called a "Jerry curl"  I told them it was natural, but it stuck.  It's cool, I dont mind.  Some of the other guys have nicknames...well one...his nickname is "Tank"...I actually dont know his real name. And I get free food on my break too.  I got off early today cause it wasnt as busy and I am working Thursday and Friday next week.  I am exhausted from the walking at the zoo and work.  So I am just gonna sit back and listen to some music and take a shower.  Later I might go for a walk.  "Good morning, my rival." -Alucard

       Song of the Day:    urlLink Bitter Ending  by 9mile2go  Mood:  Sleepy  Suicide Machines concert is next week, and i need to find somebody to go with.  If Marty can't go then maybe I could get Kate to go.  It should be really insane.  Suicide Machines really know how to rock socks.  First day of work, easy.  Alot of the guys play stuff.  One plays guitar, and another plays drums...one guy said the father of the old drummer for suicide machines (Derek Grant) came in one day.  Apparently this guy was talking about the concert he went to with Alkaline Trio in it, and the guy said his son played in that band.  I did not know Derek went on to play with Alkaline Trio, it seems like a very odd change.  This is the same guy that was on  "Destruction of Definition"  by the  Suicide Machines , with all the insane ska beats...and he went from that to the slower beated alternative type music of Alkaline Trio.  Well, most drummers will play anything as long as they get to rock out.  Tomorrow I am going to the detroit zoo with Kate :).  That will be fun.  I hope they have monkeys >_  Oh yea, I added some more bands on the side bar for your browsing pleasure.  Tomorrow I will work on the "other" section, which is a tad dated.  I'm gonna go catch some Z's, I'm tired. Cya.  "scream if you want to,  that i never really loved you, you set me up to take the fall. you tell me that you loved me, and that you'd never leave me, yet im the one who's all alone." -9miles2go (download the song up at the top, and post a comment on it...just an idea...)

      My cousin who was previously in Things About Nothing has been doing alot lately and is in two killer new bands.   9miles2go  is a band he joined up with and they previously were on an   urlLink Asian Man Records   compilation.  They are working on an EP with my cousin on it, you can download  "Bitter Ending"    urlLink here .  I like it.  They are also going on tour in May.     Designed By You   is more local and is pretty new,  I managed to go to one of their concerts a little while ago, and they were good.  They call themselves "skacore" a mix of ska (no horns) and hardcore.  You can download their song  "Happyness to Sorrow"    urlLink here  that will be on their split EP with My Friend Ehab (local hardcore band).  As I said before, he is going on tour in May and coming back in june, and he said he would record our band in his finished studio, so that gives us about a month and a half to get our songs together which will probably plenty of time.  The only bad part is that school will be ending just as it comes out so we will have a harder time getting word out because school would be a really good way to get people's attention.  Just wanted to fill you in on some local news, check out those songs and download them.

      The band Squirtgun has some interesting things going on:  4.08.04 - The "Burn for You" video premiered on MTV Latino last night on their "120 Minutes" program.  MTV Latino is aired all over Latin America, and is also available on several satellite and cable packages in the U.S.  Go to the  urlLink Squirtgun  website to see the video, I saw it, and it was pretty good, it guest stars Kris Roe from the Ataris  Also another punk rock musician has made a blog...The bassist for Squirtgun: Mass Giorgini.  THere will be a link to that on the side right after I finish typing this post.  Also listen to this: 4.03.04 - Flav's main guitar from the early days of Squirtgun in being auctioned on  urlLink ebay . This guitar was used on Squirtgun's debut CD in 1995. It was also used on Screeching Weasel's Wiggle and Anthem For A New Tomorrow, and several other sessions. Flav bought it new in 1989 and used it in Rattail Grenadier and Squirtgun. Bid here on a piece of punk rock history!  That would be really sweet to get that guitar...I mean it was on a screeching weasel cd...lol this is what it is called on the bidding site:   Epiphone SG Squirtgun Screeching Weasel Guitar      Well that's all for now, i found alot of good music news today :)

      I almost peed my fucking pants when I got ahold of this information.  They got a new website and everything, it is down right now, but when you read this it might be up.   urlLink Click here bitch!! .  The gods of pop punk are back, and guess what?? They might be coming to detroit in the summer!! For more info go to Ben Weasel's blog on the side bar, and go down a little ways and you will see what he wrote about it all.  Unfortunatly here is what Weasel said about them making a new record:  "With this band? Not bloody likely, unless the earth starts revolving backwards and dogs and cats start living together."   However, he says he would like to do regular shows and tour again, but staying true to his unclear ways here is his summary of the whole matter on Screeching Weasel: Okay, so to sum up:  1. I have no idea what’s going to happen.  2. I kind of like it that way.  3. I don’t give a fuck.  4. It’s fun not giving a fuck. Trust me. Try it – you’ll see.   5. Fuck you (see #4).  That was a true Ben Weasel statement...well...we are all just gonna have to keep our fingers crossed, but we are on the list for the "rough" list for the tour that will go down most likely this summer, this is the list anyways: Detroit Cleveland New York Boston Philadelphia D.C. Pittsburgh Cincinnati St. Louis Chicago  Once again for more info, check out Ben Weasel's blog over there.  And I really really hope they come here...but still this is some great fucking news...

       Song of the Day:  Long Good Night by the Get-Up Kids  Mood:  waiting for the fun to start  I was going through music I hadn't listened to in awhile and I found myself in my emo stuff, now i'm in a stupid emo mood. Dammit.  I got a job!! Hope's Fish and Chips, I wash dishes...exciting i know...at least i am getting money...I need it pretty bad.  Spring break has sucked so far.  I said before this week the fun would start when we would have our band practice today.  Brandon wasnt home or something so we had to cancel, and i had a really boring day.  Maybe I can do something when Kate comes home tomorrow, I really miss that girl :(.  Where are my Vans? its been 3 weeks, so they should be coming any day now...I hope I get them before school starts up again, that would be nice.  I'm so bored, and I am waiting for something to happen...maybe i should just go to sleep...

      I found this in somebody's profile:   Ode to the Nice Guys    This rant was written for the Wharton Undergraduate Journal    This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girl’s every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style.  This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back from parties and never take advantage once they’re at her door, for the guys who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow don’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for you.  This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldn’t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree you’d ever orchestrated in GTA3 to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she didn’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: “oh, but we’re just friends!” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you went anyways. Because you’re nice like that.   The nice guys don’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the nice guys don’t seem to get laid as often as they should. And I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I can’t. From what I have observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he’s too nice to date” or “he would be a good boyfriend but he’s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much from me, I couldn’t possibly ask him out!” or the most frustrating of all: “no, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (I’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!). But one thing I can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesn’t last forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted. The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones that are single.   So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You know who you are, and I know you’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your well deserved vindication is coming.  Fu-zu Jen, SEAS/WH, 2003  A-fucking-men  I was one of those guys, but now I got Kate :) So I got what I deserved- a good girlfriend.  The other guys that are still waiting, you will hopefully get what you deserve to.

       Song of the day:  Before I Go  Mood:  satisfied  Yea, havent written in awhile.  But does anybody care? Exactly.  The new band is doing pretty good, we have had two practices and have about 4 songs in production.  BY the way, the new band is me, marty, mike and brandon, and it is a ska band.  I am happy I am actually practicing once again and feeling motivated, and writing songs.  We can't decide on a good name though, some are:  -Peeping Tom and the Private Eyes (me and brandon like it, marty will accept it and mike doesnt like it)  -Four Fingers and Their Time (FFATT) This name can be taken many ways, i like the fact it spells out FFATT so people can just say fat.  I know Marty likes it, and I am ok with it, but I am unsure of mike and brandon  -The Corporate Skulls- Name of Marty's old band we can use.  I like it and the icon is cool (skeleton with briefcase, tie, and hat running)  I dont know who else likes it  Those are the major ones anyways.  Still unsure of what to go with, if you have any ideas or anything, you can talk to us.  We practiced today, so i feel accomplished.  Kate wont pick up the phone :(  but i bet you dont care.  Bye  "Stretch my wings to fly, you can fall on me." -Before I Go (Good name and the letters form BIG heh)

       Song of the Day:  Darko by Slick Shoes  Mood:  Procrastinating again  I found an MP3 of Darko while surfing around Suicide Machine's Label's site (Side One Dummy).  I liked their name, Slick Shoes.  You want to know what else I like?  urlLink This!  These guys look pretty cool, and I would really like to hear a song of theirs just to see if they are good.  I think all bands should have music on their website so people can have a listen to see how they are like.  I saw The Day After Tomorrow today with my mom, and it was good.  Good special effects, funny at certain moments, suspenseful, and even has a nice little moral at the end.  For some reason I thought of Mr. Friedrichs when I saw this movie.  The best part of this movie had to be when (get this) Americans started crossing the border into Mexico illegally...hahaha.  It was like bizarro world.  Anyways, I have to go my sister is bitching at me to get off and I have a shitload of homework to do yet. adios

      Song of the Day: Broken Down by Mike Felumlee (The Turn) Mood: Bored and unaccomplished  I downloaded the song above and a couple others from  urlLink this  website.  I like them.  I actually might think about checking out this concert as well.  I took a walk tonight at around 10, I havent taken a walk at night in awhile.  I listened to my Ben Folds CD cause I havent listened to it in awhile.  It was pretty dark, but for some reason I am not scared even though I am surroned by woods, I am just so familiar with the place I feel fine.  It also might be that whole "invincibility" feeling you get as a teenager.  Maybe one of these days it will catch up with me and I will be killed by some psycho on one of my walks.  But until then I will keep enjoying them.  I didnt accomplish anything I wanted to do this weekend.  I didnt see The Day After Tomorrow, practice with Marty, go fishing with my dad (he never called), or do some filming with Nick and the others.  I slept alot, and Kate hasnt called yet from her cottage, I guess she must not be getting a reception, I know I couldnt at my cottage, and she doesnt have a phone at the cottage either.  Well, at least she gets home tomorrow.  Tomorrow I will have to get started on alot of homework.  My birthday is closing in, and I am not really sure what I want.  My mom is thinking of a TV for my room, that would be nice.  I think what I really want is to start being happy with my life this summer, just have some fun this summer.  Work on the band, maybe record, go to concerts, spend time with friends, go to the spree, spend time with Kate and just try to truly be happy again.  Maybe I can start eating healthier too and working out, I heard exercise helps people with stress.  Eh, I always say that I will start eating healthier and working out, but I never seem to do it...maybe I will have enough free time this summer, and really get determined.  That would be nice, and I would feel better about myself.  Well, I am gonna go for now, I will see you later whoever reads this.

      I woke up about an hour ago. It feels good to sleep in on a Friday.  We have a 4 day weekend.  From the Simpsons: Marge: Homer, the plant called and they say if you don't come to work today, don't bother coming in on Monday. Homer: Woohoo! 4 day weekend!  Yea, but anyways, I got work today and I really wanted to see the Day After Tomorrow which comes out today.  If anybody wants to see it contact me, cause I want to too.  I made an "Other" section on the sidebar.  You can have some fun clicking around there, more links will be up.  A note about the Michigan Hardcore link though: it isn't just hardcore, it features alot of people in different types of bands.  You can check out classified ads there for people looking for bands or musicians for Michigan bands, and some other stuff.  I got to take a shower bye.

      If you were in my AP History class last semester you might recall a trailer for a movie called the Blair Chicken Project at the end of a project we had to do.  We are gonna actually make the movie for fun.  Right now, Matt Guibord, Nick Kehn and I are working on a rough script.  There will probably be alot of people involved in this little project which will probably turn out as a Comedy Horror movie, if you have any ideas feel free to post, as long as they arent negative.

      OK, work first sucked then rocked.  It sucked for the first couple hours cause I forgot to take my medicine until late into the day, so I felt kinda woozy and not feeling much like working.  We didnt have much to do so we just talked and messed around near the end. At one point all the guys were in the freezer trying to punch holes in the frie boxes, it was one of those you had to be there moments, then one of the pussy waitress girls turned off the lights to it from the outside, and Tank started screaming like a girl which was funny even though he was joking.  Afterwards, I called my dad and asked if he would pick me up a half hour later cause I wanted to listen to some music Tank had in his car. It was a hardcore festival. I have renewed appreciation for hardcore. Alot of people hate hardcore cause either they here the stupid shit or they are mad at the screaming. You really have to look behind it the insane musicianship behind it. There are some points where I dont know what time measure it is in but it isnt like just a bunch of random noise, it has a time signature I just cant figure it out some of it is so complex. Some songs were in 5/4, some in 3/8. It was pretty crazy. Some people call it "Math rock" because you need to be very mentally prepared to play some of the stuff it has so many different time signatures. Tank let me borrow two CDs:  Fordirelifesake: it is an earlier cd, they soun so fucking raw and unproduced but they still manage to pull off some dope break-downs. They are really tight.  The Mars Volta: Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers is the bass player in this band, they are extremely talented. Sometimes the vocalist sounds like a pussy singing really high and shit, but othertimes it sounds really good.  Anyways, I am gonna watch the 4th volume of the Sopranos and then go to bed and then work on the history project

      After school today was awesome.  After Hours practice.  Josh came and jammed with us.  He loves classic rock: Jimi Hendrix, Led Zepplin, the works, and he is kick ass at guitar.  You ask him to put a sweet solo somewhere, and he will, he just loves to play.  We have about 3 songs now, and we want 2 more before we record, and hopefully we will make it there this time.  Then I went to Nick's to finish up the video.  It is really insane.  He does such a good job on editing.  We can turn a history video into a riot.  bye

      how some people decide to make fun of people if they are depressed...sort of like just sitting on the shore and watching somebody drown.  Actually, that would be more like if you didnt do anything at all or abandoned them, but making fun of would probably be more like laughing while the person is drowning...pretty sick.

      After school today the sky was green and we had to go back into school for safety, it was stupid, but the sky was cool.  After Hours isn't fucked anymore.  Marty is back in and he is coming over to write stuff with me tomorrow, I am also working on a purevolume site.  We found out Brandon's trombone has a warranty, so when we do shows we can do crazy shit with it at the end, smash it, throw it, light it on fire...and he can get it repaired/replaced for free...ah, dont you love loopholes?  I'm at my dad's, i havent been there in awhile I missed Bo and Milly.  Milly ran off today but we found her a couple hours ago, she was out in the neighbors yard meowing, we think she might have picked a fight with the neighbor's cat.  Sunday we are working on a history video, and with Nick's sweet editing it will be really tight.

       urlLink    GTA San Andreas&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    A drive-by with 4 guys hanging out the windows, sweet shit.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Check out the nice red low-rider in the back&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Bicycles are one of the many new vehicles...bitchin'&nbsp; urlLink      Hey, I am just trying out the photoblogging thing, the only complaint I have is that you can't post the pics all at once, so you have to go one at a time, and then put all the posts together and shit...  Anyways, GTA San Andreas comes out in October and if I could discribe this game in one word is "depth".  This game will be so realistic, it will blow all the other GTA copiers (True Streets of LA and what not) out of the water.  Let's get the stuff you probably already know out of the way: More weapons, but not too much, the makers of GTA refuse to add shit like lasers into the game and I agree.  What they are going to mainly focus on is fixing the feel of previous weapons and targeting.  There will be a couple new weapons though.  New vehicles of course. To correspond with the 90's LA type thing there will be many low-riders, not much has been said about that motorcyles and other two wheelers except the fact bicycles will be a new vehicle, which will probably turn out to be a very fun time.  Now for the crazy stuff that will blow you away.  You now don't have to go solo on your machines, you can recruit yourself a gang and go out and shoot the place up, also you can do drive-bys with 4 people hangning out the windows shooting away.  Interiors to houses is now in GTA, a prime part of this GTA will be breaking into houses and stealing things.  More areas to tear up.  There are restaurants to eat at which they began to do in Vice City but this is way more in depth.  If you eat too much fast food, you will actually get fatter.  People will call you "fat bastard" as well, and your stamina will decrease accordingly.  How do you get back in shape?  Just like in real life, go to the gym, and tone your body.  There will be 3 seperate cities just like before, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Francisco (different names will be used in the game).  The difference is that there is countryside between these cities.  Think about it, driving out of Los Angeles, past smaller and smaller rural areas, over a MOUNTAIN (yes there will be mountains) and eventually into Las Vegas.  You may realize now how huge that San Andreas's world will be.  There will be so much to explore, it is mind-boggling.  Ok, that's all I have to say about that, I am tired...

      After Hours is in a sort of fucked up stage right now.  I guess Marty quit cause he was fighting with Evan or something, we have another guitarist who I havent met yet, but Evan still wants Brandon to play trombone when I thought he should go to bass.  Evan says he can easily find a new bass player, but still, it would be odd having two guitars and a trombone in a ska band...  I think we are temporarily fucked at the moment.  I'm really sick of bands not working.

      Mars is what we played at the concert tonight, It's a really cool piece...the first time you hear it..yea I am weary of Mars...  Anyways, right now I am downloading this Photoblogging thing so you can actually see pictures on here! cool huh? hello? oh yea nobody reads this...  Anyways, me and marty are gonna get together on Saturday and work together on writing music and lyrics, when we write lyrics we seem to think our own is stupid, so maybe if we work together we will have more self confidence.  I think this will really help just sitting down me and him.  Also, we have another guitarist all of a sudden who is really good? I dunno, I just found out today, but I think we have enough problems as it is.  It might work, I always wanted to try having two guitarists.  So, I am going to do some homework, I feel better than I did when i had that earlier post.

      I obtained this via Weasel Manor (Ben Weasel's Blog).  It is on the sidebar if you would like to visit it.    If you want to make a name for yourself in punk in 2004, do the following:  1. Be from an upper middle class or wealthy family. If you can't tour constantly nobody will sign you and you can't tour constantly if you have to worry about things like holding onto a job in order to pay bills.  2. Move to California.  3. Copy the crap on the radio. That's what sells. Don't forget the choreographed jumps, hair dye and gel, tattoos, and strategically ripped clothes. But make sure to hedge your bets; don't start getting a lot of tattoos until you've really made it and go with a Safety-Hawk until fame permits you to shave the sides of your head.   4. Kiss a lot of ass. In fact, just to be safe, kiss every ass you see. Fake enthusiasm for the shittiest bands, 'cause they'll be the ones to hit it big, at which point you'll be well-positioned to ride their coattails.   5. Get your wealthy family to funnel you some cash so you can hire an entertainment lawyer, a manager and publicist, for starters.   6. Make sure your politics are correct. Be as rabidly left-wing as possible. If you're ambidextrous, you can write anti-Bush songs with one hand and rake in the profits with the other. The wealthier you grow, the louder you should be in complaining about the wealthy. And don't forget to remind everyone that you're still a punk rocker.   7. Upon gaining fame and fortune, forget where you came from as quickly as possible. The people in your past should consider themselves lucky to have been graced by your presence. Since they can't do anything for your career now, forget them, unless it's to drop their name when you're in need of some punk rock credibility.   8. Never forget, there is no such thing as enough money. When the people you surround yourself with to manage your career tell you to be worried, as they always will, be worried. That way you'll make as much money as possible, and the only others who will benefit will be those keeping you paranoid about not having enough money.   9. When people point and laugh at you for being a ridiculous performing monkey with no character, balls or talent, just tell yourself they're jealous. That's what Kevin Costner does and it seems to work for him.   10. Having made a fortune parading around like a cartoon, start making "serious" music.

      I'm having a real hard time writing music, I keep feeling its shitty or not right.    I think the main problem is I have these limitations, Marty hates emo and pop punk and pretty much anything that doesnt scream now, and now I have to try to make sure everything I am writing he is ok with.  I remember how it used to be fun, and sometimes words would flow out of me, now it seems like chore, and I just sat in my bed today and thought how fucked it all was and what I am gonna do.  I fell asleep before I could think of anything.

      I was bored so I did a bit of researching, and looking for some upcoming tour dates:  The Real McKenzies sre coming on the 22nd but they dont specify where they are it just says some garage festival in detroit, thanks alot, i would like to see them live, but they dont feel the need to say where they are! >_  They are coming back to Michigan 2 days later but it is all the way in Kalamazoo: May 24th Kraftbrau Brewery 402 East Kalamzoo Ave, Kalamazoo   Less Than Jake is coming July 26th at the DTE Energy Music Center, cool huh? I am not going though, why not? Here is who is with them: Linkin Park, Korn, The Used, and (get this) Snoop Dogg  That should be a fucked up concert, but Less Than Jake has done this before, some other people they have toured with are P. Diddy and Bon Jovi. Sick.  Reel Big Fish is coming to Freedom Hill on June 29th with Catch 22, The RX Bandits and more, that might be a decent concert, but isnt Freedom Hill the place where you can sit on the grass or get those seats up front and it is outside? That would be weird.  The Lawrence Arms return to Michigan on August 2nd with Tsunami Bomb and others, they are at the Shelter, I'm going to try and go to this one.  That's all I found for now, I know, not many people are coming for awhile, it sucks, hopefully my cousin will have a shitload of concerts I can go to when he returns from tour in June.  Oh yea, I did find this though:  urlLink Click .  It is a Japanese animation of the "I Believe I Can Fly" cover by Me First And The Gimme Gimmes, there are a lot of cute animals :).  that's all for now.

      I forgot to mention I got Worms 3D for PS2 awhile ago, and it is keeping me busy.  I have done like 30 missions and I am only like 25% done, so yea, it is a good game.  Some people are pissed that it is in 3D, but I like it, also the Bazooka is easier to aim in 3D.  There are also a couple new weapons, a more in-depth landscape generator, lots of missions and more.  However, they got rid of the Suicide Bomber and Kamikaze weapons...probably because of the shit happening in the middle east...don't want to get certain people angry.  Oh well, I barely used those weapons anyways.  I am currently going through the long process of putting all my links back up, I really should have copied my template, but now I have to go and find all the band links and other links again >_  Also, the 9miles2go site is finally up, some parts are still under construction, but the tourdates and guestbook and some other stuff are running, so  urlLink check it out .  They are currently on a large scale US tour, I think they are just going out west to california and back doing shows along the way.  Sounds fun, I am gonna go to one of their concerts when they come home.  Well, that's all for now.  peace

      I haven't been on here in only a week or so and it has changed alot!  They have new templates so I changed my old one to this fresh looking one.  Also, they have profiles now.  The bad thing is that I need to put all the links back there, if i can remember them -_-'. So, I will be fiddling around alot with this...  Other news: band is slow, havent practiced in awhile, Evan is on vacation and I got grounded.  Hopefully this week I can sit down with Brandon and write some trombone parts, and work on new songs, we are ditching alot of the old.  There have been a number of school band concerts, I'm am growing weary of band, I really dont like the warm-ups we do everyday, but hey, its an easy A.  Persuasive speech on tuesday...Im not even sure what I am gonna do mine on yet >_  School is almost over, god I want it to end.

      This is worth the money, you get so much for only 9 dollars, that's right, i got a new cd from media play for 8.99, a cd that includes a dvd as well, and the cd has more than 26 songs most of them new.  Why is the price so low?  It says right in the packet:  This compilation is not about making a profit; it's about making a difference .  Followed by this: It's not about "let's be punk rock and hate the government"; it's about "let's be punk rock and change the government"  and   It's not about who's a sellout or who's more punk; it's about uniting against a common enemy.   I watched the DVD and from what I saw, I had the same feeling of when I got War on Errorism by NOFX about a year ago.  I felt renewed anger, which isnt always a bad thing.  The DVD holds trailers to documentaries you can buy, music videos, and even a short comedian clip.  The pamphlet also contains a nice little forward by Fat Mike.  Don't forget some of the allstar bands that are on this comp, to see who they are go back to my old entry about a month ago when I first found out about this cd.  This is a solid comp with a raw message, dvd with extra fun, and 26 different bands, and dont forget, it is only about 10 bucks.

      I was gonna talk about this before, but I had some hold-ups.  First band that played didnt really get the crowd rocking, everybody seemed dead.  The Most was up next, they were ok.  They are skaish, they have a keyboard player and stuff, it was ok.  The crowd started to loosen up after that.  I think Then Came Silence was up next, they were good and I got their cd, they are more of a hardcore band, they are from New Jersey and they were really desperate for money, cause they didnt have enough to get home.  I donated some, and I bought their cd and some pins.  Then 9miles2go came up, and they were good, they are on the emo side and I dont think Marty liked them that much.  I got their cd and a shirt.  Designed By You was actually the highlight of the show, they crowd went crazy including me and marty.  They are skacore (mix of hardcore and ska), so you can skank like a wild man and then go straight into a mosh for the fast section.  Some people were crowd surfing, so I joined in on the fun and jumped off a speaker into crowd.  The crowd wasnt that big so I got dropped off at the end. Oops, no harm done.  Me and Marty like hardcore, but we dont like hardcore dancing, cause its pretty stupid.  It's sorta like pretending to do kung fu and beating someone up.  The Before I Go singer was there and was hardcore dancing and he spin kicked a girl in the face by accident.  She got a free sweatshirt and an apology though.  Anyways, My Friend Ehab was next.  A hardcore band which I had been waiting to hear.  Most of the people that liked to hardcore dance were up front where the band was, so it was nice to not  have to worry about them.  During this part, somebody ripped my shoe, which I fixed with staples today cause I cant find duct tape.  Then I realized that there was a gaping hole going down my crotch  and up my ass exposing my boxers, but I didnt care, and continued on my way.  By the end of the show the mosh pit was getting vicious and i was starting to get kinda pissed.  Some people were starting to swing punches, so I swung back. and I think that pissed on girl off and shit hit me in the shoulder.  Also I got my ankle kicked out under me alot, so its kinda sore today.  I got a Designed by You shirt and stickers and pins.  All in all it was a very fun concert.  Unfortunatly Designed by You wont be playing for awhile because my cousin Ben is going on tour in California with 9miles2go.  Im gonna do homework.  bye

      I deleted the gay rights post because frankly I was kinda tired of being bashed.  Also, I was confused as to who wrote what.  All I know is that I was right about my paranoia: there are alot of people I know that hate me secretly.  Anybody that reads this and hates me please comment on why you hate me and who you are. please stop the anonymous bashing...  I just want to say to whoever said I labeled myself different things different days, I dont do that, I dont recall it at least.  I like lots of music, and some months i listen to certain stuff more than others, and I just talk about what I am listening to at the moment.  Jessi, I'm sorry, I dont know much about colleges, and I am sorry I didnt feel like getting involved.  But I wish you didnt see my actions as temper tanrums, I have problems too, and I wish you would recognize them too sometimes, I go to counseling and I take medicine too.  Maybe we both need to be more open to eachother's problems.  I love you.  So, just lay it on me, all my friends and enemies, post why you hate me, its a free-for-all.  I dont want to sound more like a crybaby, but I have to go cause I am bursting.  Sorry.

      The following lyrics are from  Floater by Everytime I Die .  First time I read them and listened to the song, I got chills.  To my mistress the bridge, I don't feel well. I'll be leaving, and you can't stop me. We've been carrying on to long, I'm sorry, but I'm gone. I've got a bad reputation to think about. I've been dirty, I've been wrong. Maybe someday they'll find that I've washed up. I'm stepping out, to clear my head. I'm breathing in, to fill my lungs. We're all dead. Farewell scenic highway overpass. It's better this way anyways. My lover the river makes  a better soldier than a bride. But I left my suit at the side of her bed, and she's got the warmest body I ever had.  Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love.  Bring the children to the water, and let them see what what heartache did. This matrimony needs a witness, and you can teach them to swim. Don't let your dreamers, grow up to be dead men. Drown us at birth, and save her some time. drifting on on romantic holiday, breathless as her cold arms carry me.  Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love.    What I interpreted it as, as you probably have, is he is commiting suicide by jumping off a bridge into the water below because of heartache.  His dead body is the floater.  As for the line "Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love."  That probably means if you were to drag a net through the lake as if fishing you would find dead bodies from lost loves.  It's pretty chilling, but I really like alot of their lyrics, and no, they arent all about suicide.

      Song of the Day: Romeo A Go-Go by Everytime I Die Mood:alright   Everytime I Die  is a hardcore band, I decided to pick up their cd after I was sent a link to a video of theirs.  The cd is  Hot Damn!  and it sounds pretty good.  I got it at media play while I was preordering my copy of  Spider-Man 2  which I will get tomorrow.  I was watching the Daily Show and was delighted to see  Brandon from The Lawrence Arms  featured in one of the segments.  It was about right-wing punks and Brandon didnt believe in it.  I kinda agree with him, but they really made him look like a asshole which made me sad.  That's what the Daily Show is really good at, taking an issue, taking a side, and pummeling the otherside.  Oh well.   The Suffering  is actually a good game. I am almost half way done, because i was stuck and had to look at a walkthrough.  It is gory, and very thrilling.  The makers love  the Shining  and incorporated alot of things from the Shining into it.  You will constanlty see flashes of usually gruesome images and sometimes time slows down and you see something that isnt really there and it will act out something from the past to help you piece together what happened.  It's complicated but I suggest you check it out.  Ta ta for now.

       Song of the Day:  Worms Make Dirt by the Aquabats  Mood:  happy, but still missing Kate  My mom got back from Paris and brought some cool stuff home for me.  For any of you who dont know  Champ Elysses     (pronounced: Shamp El-lee-say-s...i think)  is a street in Paris.  And she got me a shirt that said that.  It works out perfectly because it is a very cool  NOFX  song too!  She also got me some   crazy french candy  .  I rented  Driver 3 .  It was...okay.  I played for a day and then got bored with it.  It is insanely difficult in that once you fail you dont really feel like trying again.  So, I decided to just use a cheat to unlock all the missions, and I watched all the cut scenes and called it a day.  However, the graphics were amazing.  Today I returned it and got  The Suffering.   So far it is ok, but I dont know why I got it cause I never really had a thing for horror/survival games.  I have been renting these games from Chart Hits Video (previously was Video Jack until it closed a month or so ago or something)  I am very happy with this new place, Video Jack had very outdated games and rarely picked up new ones, so they barely had a selection.  Also when my mom renewed our membership at this new place, she forgot to put restrictions on my membership, so I can get whatever I want when I go by myself >:) muhahaha.  I went to the spree on wensday and it was fun.  I saw ben and brandon and nolfo there, but I couldnt stay long after Kate left because I had to clean up my house.  We are gonna start filming another movie this week, one with an actual storyline, and if it is good enough maybe we can send it into an independent movie thing or something.  It will be fun though.  Kate left for a week today :( and I miss her already.  yesterday was our  6 month  though yay! wow, half a year :D  I m  g o n n a  g o  n o w , b y e

       urlLink    Spider-Man 2&nbsp; urlLink     I am very excited about this game, and it hits the shelves June 29th.  Instead of me talking about it though, I will let you read a previer from  urlLink  Game Informer . .  The movie looks good too.   "Spider-Man wowed us in his first feature film adventure a couple years ago, and likewise, gave gamers the opportunity to swing through the air once again in another console adventure. Well, with the upcoming release of Spider-Man 2, Activision is once again getting geared up to send the web-slinger to home consoles in a game of the same name. If you got sick of the persnickety camera of the last game, as well its somewhat linear and constricting adventure, prepare to enter Spidey heaven. Taking careful notice of what didn’t work in the first Spider-Man game, Activision and developer Treyarch has overhauled the arachnid hero’s next game with some truly innovative and addictive features. But as with any sequel, the question remains: is it better than the first?  While we haven’t seen the latest Spider-Man film, we can say that the game will include quite a bit of content drawn from the feature film. Spider-Man will take on Doc Ock following his ill-fated experimentation with mechanized arms, as well as follow the on-again, off-again relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. But to extend the life of the game, Activision has taken some freedoms in adding quite a bit of different Spider-Man universe content. During your adventures you’ll face off against some classic villains, such as Mysterio and Rhino, as well as run into some unlikely allies like Black Cat. These additions work pretty well in the game, but do seem a bit odd so far since they aren’t directly tied to the film. But if you look at the game as more of a general Spider-Man title, these inclusions are pretty fun and it’s neat to step outside the bounds of the film to take on some classic Spidey villains.   While the first Spider-Man game was a bit linear and featured a lot of “going from point A to point B” navigation, Spider-Man 2 blows the idea of linearity out of the water. First of all, Activision has created an entirely accurate scale model of the island of Manhattan. Nearly every aspect of the island has been recreated in the game, from the Empire State Building to the World Trade Center lights that shine straight up into the sky. If you take the time to climb up onto any tall building, you’ll be faced with a spectacular view. The most amazing thing about that feature is the fact that you can travel to pretty much any area that you can see. Want to snag a web to a helicopter and ride out to the Statue Of Liberty? How about swing through Times Square on your way to Central Park? Well, all of those things are possible.   Fans of mission-based gameplay don’t burst into tears quite yet. The game still does feature a main storyline that involves playing through mission-based levels. The game is essentially broken down into different chapters. At the beginning of each chapter you’re given requirements to fulfill in order to progress to the next one. While there are a ton of chapter-based objectives, the real meat of the game comes in the mind-boggling number of secondary missions. Since you have the freedom to swing about Manhattan at your leisure, you can run into and take part in a wide number of different missions and sub-games. These range from things like taking out pickpockets, delivering pizzas, rushing through the city to meet up with Mary Jane within a certain amount of time, as well as trying to uncover all the hint markers in the game or climb every major skyscraper. If you’re a particularly skilled gamer, you may be able to run through the regular missions in a reasonable amount of time. But it’ll take a truly dedicated gamer to actually complete the game 100 percent.  The game’s mission structure isn’t the only thing that’s gotten a makeover. Swinging through the city has also gotten a facelift, now allowing you to swing more intuitively and with far more control. Web swinging usually begins with a jump, which can now be charged up. Pressing the X button will cause Spider-Man to crouch on the ground, his jumping power increasing the longer you hold it. Letting go of it will send him skyward in a spectacular leap. While in the air, a press of the R1 button (or right trigger on the Xbox) will shoot out a string of web. To keep your momentum going, you need to actually hold down the X button while in mid-swing to build up your swinging momentum. At the peak of your swing, you can let go of the X button and Spider-Man will carry his momentum into the next swing, at which point you need to press the web string button again. It may sound a bit confusing, but after a few minutes, you’ll get the hang of it. Spider-Man is also capable of shooting out two web strings at once, one for each hand. Doing so will cause him to hang in mid-air, which can prove handy when you’re trying to swivel around to face a certain direction. And, Spidey can attach his web to things like light posts and stop lights to hang upside and catch an upside down view on the world.   While handy for getting around, web slinging is also essential for combat. Web can be used to ensnare enemies, making them virtual sitting ducks to take your punishment, as well as used in conjunction with hand-to-hand combat to create some slick attack combos. And this time around, Spider-Man is sporting a virtual arsenal of attacks and moves. When it comes to hand-to-hand combat, Spider-Man is capable of unleashing a widearray of different attack combos, both ground and air-based. The game uses a special “hero points” system of purchasing additional combat moves. Pretty much every mission or objective in the game will reward you with the points, which can then be spent at special stores scattered through the city. In addition to melee combat, Spider-Man can also use his special Spidey sense to slow down time, making it easier for him to put the hurt down on his enemies. I have to give it to Activision; they’ve really spruced up the combat in the game, making it quite fun to bust out some spectacular moves. Ensnaring an enemy in web and then swinging him through the air to knock down his cronies is a blast and something that you didn’t see in the first Spider-Man game.  Visually, the game is looking pretty good and is a noticeable step up from the first game in the series. Spider-Man sports some impressive detail, as do most of the bosses. Regular enemies, however, seem to have gotten smacked with the generic stick. You’ll spend a lot of time beating down baddies that look exactly the same, which is a bit disappointing. Most impressive are the visuals of the entire city itself. While the detail isn’t revolutionary in any way, the technology itself that renders the city without any loading whatsoever deserves commendation. When you do swing in close to buildings, the detail level on them will increase, which is a nice touch.   Audio-wise, Activision and Treyarch have gone the extra mile, enlisting the voice talents of Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, and others from the film. Tobey puts forth the most impressive effort, delivering corny one-liners with a particularly nice panache. Kirsten Dunst, however, seems to deliver her lines with some lackluster enthusiasm, which was a bit disappointing. But, fans of the ever sarcastic Bruce Campbell will be happy to hear that he’s back and providing the voiceover work for the game’s training mode, and dizzying number of hint markers.  Overall, Spider-Man 2 is shaping up to be a nice companion to the upcoming film. Not only does it allow you to take part in key scenarios from the movie, but also lets you take part in some non-film Spidey action.  The new combat system, the sprawling city, and the top-notch voice talent help to ensure that the game is a nice companion to the film. And it doesn’t hurt that the game features some user-friendly controls and a pretty competent camera. So even if you’re planning to wait in line for hours to see the new film, make some time on your calendar for the game. You won’t be disappointed."  -Chris Cook

      The premier was great.  There was fantastic editing done on this piece.  Nick and Matt stayed up all nite working on it, and it looks great.  The video was synced with the music and there were several special effects used: illusion of the same person being in the shot at the same time, slow motion, fast motion, backwards...and everything fit in perfectly.  My favorite part was when me and marty battled on the merry-go-round, and I think Nick set it so it played twice as fast so it looked even better.   You all can buy a DVD for like 7 bucks, and I suggest you do it.  I am really into the Sopranos, I'm on the 3rd season now.  But one of the last episodes just disturbed me.  Ok, so Tony (main character, pretty much head of the mafia) has a therapist and she gets raped, and they show it, and this is an HBO series so they really show it.  It was revolting.  Then to make things worse the fucker gets out of it after being caught because of some technicality.  So she is at a fast food place and sees the rapist's picture as the employee of the month.  Then she gets this dream.  She gets her hand stuck in a vending machine, and a rottweiler is there and she thinks its gonna hurt her.  then the rapist shows up in the dream and starts touching her and the rottwieler jumps on him instead of the therapist.  So, she analyzes the dream.  The vending machine is her guilt for parking in a empty shady-looking parking garage and not gettin escorted to her car, she is is "caught" in her guilt.  The rapist...is the rapist.  The dog is Tony.  Even though he is a hostile mob guy he can actually help her.  SO, later on she meets with Tony for one of his sessions, she starts crying and Tony asks what is wrong and if there is anything he can do.  And she says No.  Then the episode ends.  I was so pissed, I really wanted the rapist to die.  It was so goddamn sick.  People are sick, this kinda shit happens everyday, I dont mean the mafia shit, but just the rape.  Seeing that, even though it was just acting, really struck something in me, but in the wrong way.  What the fuck is wrong with people.  If your that horny and lonely go to a whorehouse.  All women should be equipped with mace or kung fu, so that doesnt happen anymore.  Hell, even guys to, when they are born, strap a friggen belt on their diaper and a holster with mace on it, let them carry it around to protect themselves till they die.  No more rape goddammit.

      Bush sucks, I think we have proven that throughout his rule, but now it's time to focus more on the good than the bad.  Now, I'm gonna spend less time showing you how bad Bush is and how good John Kerry is (even though it is fun to make fun of Bush, but don't worry, I still might do it along the way).  Here is John Kerry's Plan for the first 100 days in office:   1) A New National Education Trust Fund    We will propose a National Education Trust Fund to make sure that, for the first time ever, we fully fund our schools so they have the tools to assure our kids can succeed in the 21st century economy.  We will make a new deal on education – if Washington is going to mandate something for our schools, then the funding should be mandatory.      (2) A New Era of National Service    John Kerry will call on Americans of all ages – from students to America’s seniors - to serve in our classrooms, after school programs, nursing homes and nursery schools.  We will fight to allow students to earn four years of college tuition in exchange for two years of national service.     (3) End the ‘Era of Ashcroft’    John Ashcroft has launched an all-out assault on individual rights, allowing for a wholesale invasion of attorney-client conversations, e-mails and telephone calls. Immediately after the election, John Kerry will name a new Attorney General whose name is not John Ashcroft. We will also fight to protect women’s rights, civil rights and workers rights and enforce anti-trust laws.    (4) Repeal Bush Assault on the Environment and Make U.S. Energy Independent    We will rollback the George W. Bush assault on clean air and clean water and work to strengthen our nation’s environmental laws.  Kerry will also put forward a plan to make the U.S. energy independent of Middle East oil in ten years—and create 500,000 jobs by investing in energy renewable sources, such as ethanol, solar, and wind.      (5) Rejoin the Community of Nations    We will immediately declare the Bush policy of unilateralism over and work to rebuild our shattered alliances all across the globe. We will launch a successful war against terrorism and also restore trust here at home and abroad by making sure that America always tells the whole truth.     (7) Reward Companies that Create Jobs not Phony Corporate Profit    We will work to reward companies that create jobs by helping with health care costs, a new manufacturing jobs tax credit and new assistance for small businesses. We will also close every single loophole for companies that take jobs offshore and apply new criminal penalties, such as RICO penalties, on companies that defraud their customers and workers.    8) Create a Middle Class Economy and End the Privileged Class Economy    We will fight to repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so that we can invest in education and health care.  We will also protect middle class tax cuts, such as the child credit and the elimination of the marriage penalty and propose additional tax credits to help middle class families make ends meet.    (9) Cut the Deficit in Half in Four Years    We will put forward a budget to restore fiscal sanity, eliminate corporate welfare, and cut the deficit in half in four years. However, we will keep our compact to seniors by securing Medicare and Social Security and protecting our children and veterans.     (10) End Influence Peddling and Secret Deals    We will reinstate the five-year ban on lobbying so that government officials - like Bush’s former campaign manager and FEMA director - cannot cash in by peddling influence.  We will also shine the light on the secret deals in Washington by requiring every meeting with a lobbyist or any special interest deal inserted into a bill by a lobbyist be made public.   That's it, and if you want to learn more just go to  urlLink JohnKerry.com , which is on the sidebar as well under "Other".  Expect much more updates on this in the future.  Also view my John Kerry Volunteer site thingy which is right above the John Kerry site.  Please watch Farenheit 9/11 when it comes out too if you want to see more "Bush-bashing", I think it came out at the perfect time, right near the elections.  Bush will probably lose alot of votes from this.

       The Suicide Machines  are currently off the road and working on new songs. A few select U.S. Midwest and Canadian dates are being planned for September as well as a San Juan, Puerto Rico date slated for late August. They will post the specifics at the  urlLink website  when they're closer to being confirmed. A new album will be recorded this fall and released early next year.  In other news, Brad or whoever runs the Before I Go website apparently bought a tortoise:  "I also bought a tortoise. He will grow to be 200 lbs. and live for over 100 years. It's the best thing I've ever done."  I'm not sure if its true or not.  As for our bands news, quite frankly, we are slacking off badly.  We haven't practiced in god knows when.  It has to do with everybody going on vacation.  Anyways, a break is good, I need time to write stuff.  We are unsure of a name, but we might go with Step 12.  It means like, you know those step 12 programs from AA and etc? They all are pretty much the same and step 12 is always something like: "Take the things you learned and share them with people around you".  So in a way you can see our music as being step 12...  Anyways, the PA system is amazing and I can't wait to see it in action even at practice which I hope will be soon.  Well that's all for now I guess, bye.

      9miles2go (cousin's band) is going to play at Blueprint 76's CD Release show.  Why is this band so important?  Royce Nunley is the bass player for it ( EX: SUICIDE MACHINES  aka the bass player that was sweet before he left and the new gay guy joined SM, also the guy that was featured on  Destruction of Definition and Battle Hymns ).  That show should be seriously awesome and I really want to go.  More details are at their site.  Before I Go, a growing in popularity band from here in Michigan will play on the Warped Tour this year just as they did last year (On the local stage, just for the Michigan show),  In their recent mail sent via their mailing list, they had this to say:  "all im saying is get ready. if we're playing at the same time as NFG or some other douche bag band, we told you first. so show some love."  In other news Hanson is coming to town on August 11th.  Holy fuck guys, let's go.  MMbop ahfjsdkl akdjsfhl

      This was taken from a recent South Park episode where immigrants from the future were taking everybodies jobs in South Park.  That's all you need to know I guess to listen to this clip.  It is the end of the show, and just a final note that during the goofy hippy type song all the citizns of South Park are doing community work and helping the environment and joining hands and stuff.  Well, Enjoy.    urlLink

      Ok, I wear these bracelets that are nice and colorful, but I have been asked by people if they have secret meanings.  People tell me there is this thign going around where they have sexual meanings.  I was clueless, I just wore them cause they were around the house.  Well, I did further research and it turns out there is an uproar about these sex bracelets.  Well, first let me tell you how this all works:  Different colors mean different things.  When you snap a certain color your partner has to perform the sex move, and you each take turns doing this.  Apparently this all started in the 80's and began with Madonna and now is making a comeback.  Adults all over the US are freaking out and some schools are even begining to ban colored bracelets.  This is absurd, I mean, if a kid is gonna have sex, he/she is gonna have sex and it isnt going to be caused by little colored bracelets.  If a kid doesnt want to sex he/she is not going to have sex.  It's that simple.  Bracelets or no bracelets it wont change a thing.  I doubt it is even as widespread as people believe, I bet only a couple kids actual perform this sexcapade (hehe, I made up that word).  This is just another classice example of adults freaking out over nothing.  I think instead of focusing on colored bracelets they should focus on belts worn on pants that are obviously too big for a guy.  Now that is provacative and disgusting.

      A recent rant by Lewis Black on the Daily Show  "In America, we always seem to find a way to turn something into a way of making money.  This came up when a certain president passed away this week, and being the free market capitalist, he is breeding a new form of "Reaganomics" by the sale of crappy memorabilia."   "This T-shirt is all black and has text in white lettering that reads "mourning in america"...A formal mourning shirt!? c'mon!...This next t-shirt shows the passed away president and the words "The Original American" Idol surrond him.  This is true though, he was indeed a true American Idol by floating along on charm, triumphing with style over substance and idiots all across america seemed to keep voting for him!"  "Other Merchandise includes: hats, mouse pads, coffee cups, oil paintings for 600 dollars, and of course the Reagan bobble head.  Ah yes, remember our old president and fling his head when you are bored!"  "Don't worry I saved the best for last.  A Reagan support group is pushing to put Reagon on the 10 dollar bill, here is their spokesperson on a news show:  Spokesperson- 'Alexander Hamilton has gotten a long period of respect and recognition and was indeed very good at his work, but we think it is time to move on.  Also, Alexander is the only person on our currency that has not been a president.'  (Lewis Black)- The only person on all our currency that isnt a president, are you sure?? I bet you a hundred dollars you are wrong! (100 dollar bill shows up on screen featuring of course Ben Franklin who was never a president)  Idiots!"  Lewis Black is a funny guy.  I like when he shows up on the Daily Show.

       Song of the day : Pool Party by the Aquabats  Mood : Bored  At the concert I got two cds and a shirt which I forgot to mention.  I got the new Aquabats EP: Yo! Check Out This Ride! and the one with Pool Party on it: Myths, Legends and Other Amazing Adventures Vol. 2. The shirt I got is the one that says Aquabats and has the monkey guys on it.  Well, we are gonna have a band practice maybe thursday, we havent had one in awhile.  That's good though cause I need the time to write songs.  I'm looking for a new job, somewhere closer to my house.  I applied to Meijer's today, and I might get in at CVS cause my neighbor is the pharmacist there.  We are gonna start filming the movie I have been talking about before pretty soon.  That will be fun.  Ugh, Im gonna go do stuff    urlLink

      The Suicide Machines X-mas show was the best show I have ever been to because I knew and loved all teh songs played, and I got to meet them and etc etc. But The Aquabats put on a performance nobody could beat.  But before I get into that I have to talk about the other bands.  The only bad part was the first two supporting bands: Downtown Brown, and s(ome name I forgot).  The lead man in downtown brown sported a mullet, and was actually a pretty funny guy (he reminded all of us of Jack Black) but the music just sucked.  This lady dressed in old fashioned Swedish clothes came up on the stage while we were waiting for the next band to go.  There was  Yamaha piano there for her.  She also had a very strong yet fake Swedish accent (She's from Montreal).  She started talking in swedish and english mixed and then she hits a button on her keyboard and some really fake sounding drum beat comes in.  That's when I realize this is the next band.  And I actually have some clips of her:    urlLink

Also, this weekend is the Aquabats concert, I heard some of their stuff and I like it. ( it's Travis from Blink 182's old band) I heard they put on a good live show too. I know Ben wants to go, and maybe we should carpool?  I can get Marty to go too i bet, as long as he has a ride, he'll go to any concert.  Ben, post a comment about ideas.

      I got these from FoundMagazine.com, they are my favorites and I am seriously thinking about getting a subscription to this magazine.  Anyways, its just random stuff picked off the street, and alot of the times the stuff is funny.  Here they are: (Note: Captions in quotations are captions from the website, and the ones without them are my comments)    urlLink    Haha, that's classic&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    "i used to work at a bookstore in bellevue, washington.  last february i discovered this somewhat frightening/intriguing to-do list in an empty shopping basket" &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    First time I saw this, I got scared...very very scared...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    weird&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    "found in the hands of my 65 year old special needs aunt  who picks up everything she sees, especially the shiny things. she picked it up during a walk to the park in mesa, arizona." &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    "this polaroid is one of our favorites. i unearthed it from down deep  in the couch cushions. since our couches were purchased at a  second-hand store, the photo's origin is shrouded in mystery.   it's hard to tell the year, but the cars in the background and  the little girl's outfit suggest the 60's or 70's. they're most likely  just getting out of a wedding. the old guy's expression is classic--  that or he's sneezing from her perfume. "&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    "i found this note on the ground in a subway station in brooklyn.  here's what i love about it:  1. it makes one queasy to see someone with fifth-grade writing skills talkin' nasty. now, i pray she isn't actually in fifth grade but the loopdy-doop handwriting doesn't plead the case she's not. spelling-error-prone sex talk reminds you that these people are procreating, not you.   2. we're chugging along in the letter-- friends, friends, want to be friends-- and then she drops the bomb. awesome surprise ending.   3. it's 2003 and the little ladies are aggressive. this note is evidence that today's young females are finally making their presence known in the previously male-dominated field of beggin' for it. damn.   4. like many great works, there is room left for interpretation. the debate rages on in my own office. now we know she wants him inside, yes, but all the only-friends part.... is she really asking for no-strings-attached sex? or was the friends-only assertion one that subsequent paragraphs negate? was all that just a clever literary technique to draw the recipient in, a nod at innocence and protocol, a set up for the revelation of her true intentions? does she, in her heart, want to date this boy or does she truly only want, you know, to feel him inside of her? we will never know.

       Song of the Day:  Intro to the Sopranos  Mood:  confused  I'm watching the 5th volume of the sopranos, fun fun.  Walked into my moms house after work to get clothes for my dad's.  My mom was watching a movie with a guy.  I felt very awkward, cause this hasnt happened yet, I guess I knew it would happen...I just didnt expect it.  He is the guy that put in our dishwasher, I thought he was married...maybe he is, maybe he really is just a "friend".  I went back in the car and my dad asked who was over, and I said a guy.  And I could tell that wasnt good to him.  I said he probably was married and he put in our dishwasher.  My dad cried quietly, I tried to make him feel better, and asked him for a hug, and he gave me one later.  I still feel like an asshole, maybe I should have lied and said it was just another one of her girlfriends.  I hate it when my dad cries, cause you always see your dad as strong, and I never really seen him cry until the divorce.  I would be really ripped apart if i were him...I mean, your ex-wife, you once loved with another guy...doing god knows what.  I hope my dad is ok.  This is all too new, and I feel awkward.

       Song of the Day:  Ban the Tube Top by Reel Big Fish  Mood: can't wait till school is over  It's June! 10 more days till my birthday :D!  Well, Mr. Bill is our bus driver, and I must say he is the coolest bus driver I have had.  He is a black dude, and he doesn't act all ghetto.  He sometimes brings us food cause we are good, and one time he let me try these cheese pringle things and I said I liked them and a week later he gave me like a full pack of them.  He talks to us on the ride home, but I am usually listening to music though.  However, I listened today.  He was talking about how when he was on one of his tougher routes, a boy said that he wanted sex from a girl, and she said something like c'mere boy and I will show you what is coming for you, and so he got up and Mr. Bill said he heard a click and he knew she had a knife, and he decided not to do anything.  He says that if a guy touches a girl and it isnt wanted and he has a warning she has every right to "stick him" (cut him up).  And I like that philosophy.  His sister got raped I guess, so now he is really defendent of girls, and he is very respectful towards them I noticed even before this incident.  He said rape is probably the worst thing you could ever do to a lady and any man that even thinks about that has something wrong with him and Mr. Bill is right.  Anyways, the boy backed off, and the girl thanked Mr. Bill not for intervening but she would have "stuck him" if he touched her.  Some guys are just assholes.  I dont like those touchy feely types, that go around hugging every girl they see, and when I ask them for one they get this weird look on their face.  I thought they were friendly that's all, so then I know what they are really up to.  Her are some summer movies I wanna see:  Shrek 2, might see that this week  That dodgeball movie with ben stiller, that looks hilarious  Alexander- movie based on Alexander the great, featuring Colin Farrel (good actor from such movies as SWAT, The Recruit and Phone Booth) as Alexander.  Also features Angelino Jolie and a couple other peoples  Troy- I dunno if I will get around to seeing it.  If any of you people have seen it or have an opinion on these feel free to comment.  I got to unload the dishwasher. bye

Also excited about Green Day, man..where have they been?  I hope this Volume is better than the last was music wise, there were a couple songs I liked on it but the rest kinda stunk, but this also comes with features such as:  videos from bands like Alkaline Trio and NOFX  Comedy pieces from Will Ferrell and others  and six informative political shorts.  Sounds nice, plus it is gonna be not too much money, I think its either 6 or 10 dollars like before...  Speaking of the  Lawrence Arms  they are coming to the shelter on the 2nd.  Brendan says  "we are leaving on our final tour in support of the Greatest Story Ever Told on Friday. After this, kids, it's gonna be a long time before we come around. So please, if you have any desire at all to see us, please come out, and we will rock it. For real."   Coming along with them on the tour are  urlLink  Music For America     to try to get people to vote for Kerry, or at least just vote.  Thats all for now.

      I was having an interesting conversation with a viewer of this site.&nbsp; I forget how it got to this but we were discussing alien life.  Apparently there are 3 theories to alien life (Forgive me DV, if these arent fully correct):  1.&nbsp; There are no aliens from other planets,&nbsp; They are simply humans from the future that mutated due to nuclear radiation, or evolution or what not, and they found a way to travel back in time.  2. There are aliens from other planets,&nbsp; somehow they found a way to travel faster than light, which would disprove Einstein's theory of relativity.&nbsp; So they could make it here.  3. Aliens are beings from another dimension, sort of like a parallel universe.&nbsp; And they found a way to break into different dimensions.  That is over course excluding if you simply dont believe in alien life at all.&nbsp; I'm not really sure which to believe.&nbsp; It sounds very interesting though.  What do you all&nbsp;believe?

      Anchorman was so stupidly funny it was hilarious.&nbsp; My favorite part by far is the brawl with all the anchormen and Brick stumbling around holding a grenade and screaming.&nbsp; Brick definitly stole the show with such lines as:     "I heard bears can smell periods.&nbsp; They are attracted to menstration."   "I ate a red candle"   "I don't know what we are yelling about! LOUD NOISES!"   Ron Burgundy- "I thought you said this was a shortcut Brick?"  Brick- "Fantastic!"  Ron- "That doesn't really answer my question"  Brick- "OK!"     Don't forget Ron Burgundy's lines:     "San Diego...which is German for a whale's vagina..."   "Anchormen!....ASSEMBLE!!...*Blows on random seashell*"   "I'm Ron Burgendy?"  Ed-"Who put a question mark on the teleprompter?"   "GO FUCK YOURSELVES SAN DIEGO"  (somebody tricked him by writing that on the teleprompter)     They had a suprising amount of other funny movie stars scattered throughout the film.&nbsp; Ben Stiller, Jack Black...that guy from Dodgeball....

Then I decided not to be stupid and I went to the bonfire thing at Julie's even tho I was late.&nbsp; We watched   Objects In the Mirror   again.   And of course people did what I was afraid what they would do    "Where's Kate?"     &nbsp;   "How are you guys?"    They don't seem to know yet, and I didnt&nbsp;have the desire&nbsp;to explain to them.&nbsp; I just told them we werent together at the moment.&nbsp; I havent heard from her since she talked to me online that one time.&nbsp; Hopefully she is having fun in Hawaii ( >_ *  green with envy*  ) and takin a break and thinking about things...   The band practice seemed to excite Evan, he told me once he gets back on wensday he wants to do two more practices and then jump into the studio that weekend!&nbsp; Well, I'm excited too, but I dont know if that would possibly work, so I said maybe we'd be better off leaving it to the following weekend.   Tomorrow, I'm pretty sure me ben and marty and brandon and maybe some others are gonna see Anchorman...   Toodles   If you want to listen to&nbsp;a hot track may I suggest  "Overexposure"  by  Blueprint 76    or  "Tomorrow and Today"  by the same band...that ones a nice cute dorky pop punk love song

      This movie&nbsp;looks god awful.&nbsp; It looks extremely cheesy.&nbsp; I dunno about you but using "pur"  (ie: that's puuuuurrfect)  &nbsp;in a sentence when the person saying it is related to a cat was used up for me the first or second time I heard it. &nbsp; I have a feeling the only thing bringing sales to this movie would be Halle Berry dressed in a racy leather suit.&nbsp; And the sad thing is, it might work.&nbsp; If you are so interested in seeing Halle Berry nude, you might as well pick up   "Swordfish"   cause I guess she took off her top for that, so do yourself a favor and watch that instead of encouraging people to make more bad movies like this. &nbsp; This really is a sad state of affairs.&nbsp; and I have reason to believe there are 10 or so different bands that have used that name (Sad State Of Affairs) as a song name.&nbsp; I see it alot.&nbsp; There should be some hardcore sueing going around...

      Back from the Blueprint 76 cd release party, ok, lets walk thru it. &nbsp;   9miles2go   was good, no movement by the crowd, and not much movement by the new guitarist either.&nbsp; He'll loosen up in a bit hopefully. &nbsp; Bruce sucked.&nbsp; I didnt like them at all.&nbsp; The lead singer went barefoot which I found odd. &nbsp; Blueprint 76 was great, but still no movement by the crowd due to the low amount of people there.&nbsp; There was a better turnout at the Knights of Colombus and American Legion shows I have been to with groups of not well known local bands playing.&nbsp; I would say about 50 or so people showed.&nbsp; Royce reminded me of someone as he flailed about on the stage and ran about.&nbsp; Jay, yes, he reminded me of the lead singer of the Suicide Machines.&nbsp; Looks like he took some style with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a shirt, and that came with a cd, and i also got their new cd.&nbsp; I really like "1984".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There cd was good and so were they, but I wish more people came so it would be more suitable to mosh, some of their songs seemed perfect for it, and me and marty were itching to run around. &nbsp; If you guys go to the  urlLink Blueprint 76  site, it will lead you to a list of where you can buy their new cd, which is really good. &nbsp; All in all, I guess it was worth it cause I got a killer cd and got to experience them live and see 9miles2go.

      Detroit news did an article on Blueprint 76 as the artist of the week. Here is that article!:  &nbsp;   Artist of the Week: Blueprint 76   &nbsp;   Band is following it's prescribed plan   by Melody Baetens  &nbsp;   The Detroit News   &nbsp;  Redford Township-based rosk musician Royce Nunley had been a bass player and songwriter for well-known Michigan band  The Suicide Machines  nearly 10 years. Then he took a bold step and broke away from that band a few years ago after their split from Hollywood Records. He wanted to experience something different, so he formed Blueprint 76.  &nbsp;  Now with his new group, Nunley has taken role of singer and producer. Within the first month of it's inception, the fresh-faced punk band took advantage of it's home studio, Ringside Studios, and recorded an EP, helping Blueprint 76 start the touring machine.  &nbsp;  "We've done the West Coast, and we've played the midwest like a million times," Nunley says. He says the band would've toured more, but they were waiting on the release of their first official full-length album.  &nbsp;  Recorded at Ringside where Nunley has recorded other local bands, such as the Bomb Pops and Brad Jendza. Blueprint 76 on Tuesday released "Better Late Than Never". Immediatly after, the band hit the road. On Sunday, Blueprint 76 returns home for a few days to celebrate their record release at the Shelter in Detroit.  &nbsp;   Name:  Blueprint 76  &nbsp;   Lineup:  Royce Nunley, vocals; Jon Burz, guitar; Dan Powers, bass; Joe Reilly, drums  &nbsp;   Sound:  Aggressive punk rock  &nbsp;   Discography:  "Better Late Than Never" CD (2004, Broken Spoke Records)  &nbsp;   Next:  Blueprint 76 will hold a CD release party and performance Sunday at the Shelter, 413 E. Congress St. Detroit. Doors open at 6pm and cover charge is $7 for all ages.  Nine Miles To Go  and  Bruce  also will perform. The following weekend, the band will head back to the road for shows in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula. For more info visit  urlLink www.blueprint76.com   &nbsp;   urlLink     Record Release Flyer&nbsp; urlLink       I got my tickets today, me and marty are going. If you guys wanna go to the release party I suggest you get tickets early cause 9miles2go has a pretty big fan base now and Blueprint 76 has a bigger one probably, also the fire marshall reduced the amount of people allowed in the Shelter. If you guys don't go then I still suggest you check out Blueprint 76, I listened to them and they sound good.

      I just got  "The Oncoming Storm"   by  Unearth  from the suggestion of Tank.  They are another insane hardcore band.  They were featured in the same issue of Guitar World as  Every Time I Die  because they are attending Ozzfest as well.  I'm not gonna write the article up though cause I don't feel like it.  One of the things I love about them right now is the insane drums.  The drums all over the place with double bass madness and such, and different time signatures and stuff.  Track 9 titled  "Aries"  may possibly be the first song with low pitch screaming to be able to slow dance to.  The CD was only 10 bucks at circuit city which isnt much, i suggest it.  In other news, I got another e-mail for Metro detroit shows and...what's this?   The Queers ? August 7th?  sweet!   Queers Alvins, Detroit, MI Sat, Aug 7, 2004 07:30 PM     I have heard of Alvins, The Suicide Machines did a secret show there the day after the X-mas show, but I couldnt go to that.  I could possibly go to this, but its awhile off so we will see.   Forfirelifesake  had to pull out of their nationwide tour due to dificulties with their van and lack of money.  Bad news for them, but good news for us michiganders cause now they get to play lots of shows in their homestate of michigan :)  ta ta for now

       In the September 2004 Issue of  Guitar World , I was excited to see Every Time I Die have an article in it, because I was just getting into them.  Here is the article:    Every Time I Die    Punk'd   By Jim Derogatis  Andy Williams, guitarist for Buffalo, New York's southern rock-meets-speedcore quintet Every Time I Die, got the shock of his short life when he learned his band had snagged a slot on Ozzfest 2004.  "We were on tour in England with Chimaira when I got a call from our manager," says Williams. "He said, 'The label has some news.  I don't want to tell you what it is, so give them a call.' So I called our label, Ferret, and they said 'Some girl is calling here and saying you got her pregnant.  She wants to know how to get ahold of you.'       "I started freaking out,"Williams continued,"But finally they said 'No, dude, you got on Ozzfest!' We were outside at the time, standing next to this dumpster, and we started breaking bottles and screaming.  It was one of the most chaotic and surreal moments of my life.  To go on tour with Ozzy!- it's a dream come true!"      Every Time I Die  formed in 1998 after their members-Williams, guitarist Jordan Buckley, singer Keith Buckley (Jordan's brother) bassist John McCarthy and drummer Michael Novak- kept running into one another  at underground punk and metal shows in the Buffalo area.  "We just liked the same music", says Jordan. "I guess it was fate we wound up jamming together."      The group made it's recorded debut  Last Night in Town  in 2001-"It wasnt very good," says Buckley-and followed it up last year with the much stronger   Hot Damn!    (Cups: that's the cd I got, and it's really good guys, it's what I am listening to most now.) , winning raves from fans on the hardcore punk/metal scene.      "We had about three weeks to write the record, so we decided to lock ourselves in our practice space and go at it," says Williams,"it was insane, but I couldnt be happier with the results.  We definitly work well under pressure."  Fin

      Everywhere I go there is something that reminds me of Kate...  I just found out Aimee's birthday is the exact same day as Kate's...who would've known?  Kate is gonna think about all this crazy stuff while she is gone on vacation.  In the meantime, I have to go do stuff...I just need to keep busy so I dont get down.

      I'm back from the cottage, and it was fun.  I am very grateful for this place which we get to goto because of Mrs. Randall, the lady who had kids my dad grew up with, and she also considers him one of her sons.  So she is like an extra grandma to me.  She is very funny, we were talking about my grandma and the senoir community complex she lives in,and its library and she asks "Are there any good sex books?" lol, she is just very fun, open, and outgoing you would never guess she is 75.  She is up and about and very healthy.  Anyways, she has a cottage where we visit her and that is where she lives in the summer (she lives in San francisco in the winter)  and it is a beautiful place.  You walk about 50 yards down a path through a meadow in the back, and down some stairs and you are on her private beach on Lake Michigan.  Each sunset, lemme tell you, you have never seen a sunset until you have seen one from her deck.  Pink and red and orange across the clouds, the sun peeking over Lake Michigan until it finally goes under the horizon, it is quite a site.  Mrs. Randall is quite generous too, just like a grandma, if I take a liking to something she tells me to keep it, she is constantly giving me random things and when I weeded her yard today for about an hour she gave me 50 dollars.  Yup just like a grandma.  The water was a tad cold, but you just have to dive in and get used to it.  And nothing beats a midnight swim.  Go out pitch black, the water is very warm from being heated up all day by the sun, the air is cooler than the water usually, so there is a strange mist.  Go out and wade out there, kinda creepy if you are by yourself.  Look up at the stars, its great.  Maybe someday, when I am older, she will be nice enough to let me use the cottage, and I can invite some of you up there.    On a side note, the whole Kate thing may not be over yet, I'm working on it.  I still want to do everything I said tho, so, im working on that too, Im doing alot of working I guess.  And I dont want to be like Peter Griffen and his soup that got away. (eh, a thing from family guy, some may have seen it some may not)

      Kate and I arent together anymore.  I feel very empty but full of sorrow.  This long dull pain that won't go away.  A part of me wants to lay in bed forever, and another wants me to try to enjoy things and get out.  Today I went to Julie's house and gave her a second guitar lesson, just something I have been doing for fun.  But I stayed there from 2 to 10:30, and just hung out and talked and reflected.  We watched Pi, a brilliant movie that I felt like watching again after seeing that same director's other movie: Requim For A Dream the previous day.  Which was good.  and we made cookies lol...  It was nice being with company.  So I think I know which side i want to be.  I am reaching out to friends now and I just want to start seeing them again.  I want to start writing music again.  I want to be creative, I don't want to be what I was after my last relationship.  I could never survive being like that.  I am also going up to my cottage tomorrow for two days.  When I come home, I hope you guys are willing to go out and see movies and stuff cause I still want to see Spider-man 2 and Anchorman.  The problem is, I will never forget Kate, and I loved her deeply, and I don't know if I can get over it.  We were together for 6 months, and all I can think about is all the things we did...  This will be difficult, gimme a call if you wanna do something (734-968-2200), anytime, I dont care, i just need to get out...

       Song of the Day:  A new  urlLink Designed By You  song  Mood:  Bored  man I love that commercial, its when the guy takes a drink of that starbucks coffee and this band comes out of nowhere and starts chanting his name to "Eye of the Tiger".  I love it.  Spider-man 2 for PS2 is intense.  I got it 3 days ago and I beat the storyline, and I was sad at first and thought that was it.  But there is so much more to explore and do.  There are over 200 mini missions scattered all over new york, 150 skyscraper icons to collect, 125 bouy icons to get off of the bouys (spider man cant swim either) and the 100 or so secret icons to search for.  The map is enormous and it covers all of Manhatten from the ground up.  Nothing beats climbing to the top of the Empire state building, running off, then shooting a web out right before you splat on the ground.  I could spend hours just swinging around New York.  If you dont want to do all the exploration I still suggest you rent it and beat the storyline cause that is fun.  The narrator is also funny and Tobey McGuire provides funny lines as well.  I finally talked to Evan today (drummer) cause we havent practiced for months, its really hard to get everybody together during the summer cause we never see eachother.  Anyways, we are thinkin about doing something next week and we thought of a new name that is disclosed for now untill everyone agrees on it.  i guess that is it, Im very bored and I think Im gonna turn in soon.

       Music:  Take Me Away by  Plain White Ts   Mood:  sorta disappointed  I just downloaded the Take Me Away song from their purevolume site.  I kinda like it.  The chorus is addicting.   NOFX  was ok on Conan O'Brien.  I was right though.  They played Franco-Unamerican.  When Conan first came out you could see NOFX's equipment set up, and there was a huge pic of George Bush as a clown draped over the keyboard (keyboard is used in that song).  So, it was funny to see that as Conan did his monologue.  Conan is by far my favorite late night host.  He is so goofy and funny.  But NOFX played at the end, and supported their newest album even though its a year old now:  War On Errorism.   They didnt support the new Rock Against Bush compilation which came out that day at all.  Fat Mike of course was sporting his "Not My President" shirt.  Melvin and Hefe and the keyboardist had a shirt that had a stop sign but instead of "stop" it had "bush", the keyboardist had an extra small one exposing his stomach which was pretty funny, and when he played he twisted his head about like he was doing the robot.  They switched the words around in the song, for a more anti-bush sentiment, and Fat Mike was probably drunk because by the end he was trying to sing without laughing.  Yea, they were decent, it was kinda funny though...  I need sleep night night.

       Music:  American Idiot by  Green Day   Mood:  Stoked  You may notice if you listen to Lawrence Arms, I use alot of their lyrics as titles...I really like their lyrics.  and I suggest "The Greatest Story Ever Told" by the Lawrence Arms to anybody. It's so good  So I trained yet another person at work today. He is going to churchill next year, but he looks alot older than a freshman. He plays guitar and is sorta in a band with a drummer, but just lost their bassist. They were thinking about another guitar player, so maybe I will jam with them sometime. He likes alot of stuff I like, and he is going to warped this year too.  I'm excited to see  NOFX  on Conan O'Brien tonight, it should be fun...I wonder what song they will play. Perhaps  "Franco-Unamerican"?  I would assume it's from their newest cd...or maybe that song they did on Rock Against Bush vol 1?  Well, somebody put 89x on at work and they did the whole "people's choice" thing and  Green Day  apparently has been holding strong as the champion with "American Idiot"...they went up against  Korn  with their new song "word up" (a cover)...the Korn song was  so bad ....ugh...I can't believe people even voted for it...so Green Day won by a landslide, and I am happy for them. I can't wait to get ahold of their new cd. Oh yea, and their new  urlLink site  design is awesome, I love it.  Tomorrow I dont have anything to do till like 7, so if you wanna do something contact me!  "You tell me you love me, and I know it's a lie..." - The Lawrence Arms  (GO BUY THAT CD NOW!!!!!)

       Music:  Raw and Searing Flesh by  The Lawrence Arms   Mood:  tired  I forgot to mention, tomorrow..errr...well today... NOFX  will be on Conan O'Brien, which is at 12:30 am on channel 4 NBC....wait...I guess that counts as tomorrow because it's after 12.  Yea that's right.  They will help promote  Rock Against Bush vol 2  which coincidentally comes out on the very same day....hmm...  I ripped half my finger nail off my index finger...its all bloody and yucky. >_  The new Green Day   urlLink site  should be running soon, today is the day its supposed to be changed. So, look for that.  I'm gonna drink some water then go to bed, nite nite.

So, I started listening to them again, and I forgot how fun they were.  It will be cool to see them live.  Grandma's b-day party was alrite.  There are a shitload of new babies.  The next generation of the Schultz Family is upon us! O_O  besides that life's been dull...tomorrow work...nothing thursday i think...friday work...gah...

       Music:  Ebolarama by  Everytime I Die   Mood:  excited  Well, I trained the new guy at work today, that was new.  Mike pulled me off to the side to tell me I was gonna start frying soon since I have seniority over all the other dishwashers.  But the catch is I need a hairnet or an extreme haircut.  I could never cut it to the length he wants it, so it looks like I get to be the fashion statement at Hope's with an insanely hot hairnet.  So, tomorrow is my grandma's b-day so I will be visiting her and such tomorrow.  also, I'm getting warped tour tickets tomorrow.  Nick wants to do hardcore filming, so my schedule is gonna be tight this week.  preview the  urlLink new greenday song , I still need to hear it, I will get on that after this.  comment if you please

       Music:  The Fabrication of Dreams by  9miles2go   Mood:  blah   I get to work tomorrow!!!!!!!!! YESSSSS!!!!!!!! Note, the sarcasm.  There are only like two available dishwashers so we have to work alot, but the good news is we finally hired a new guy who I will be training tomorrow.  Side note, one of the bus girls broke up with her bf who she had been going out with for awhile, and he is pretending to still be going out with her....thats  creepy .  So, finally decided that I will goto the warped tour, all i need to do is get tickets and stuff.  What else...hmmm...  Here are the upcoming concerts I am going to or hoping to go to:   Warped Tour  Aug. 15   Before I Go, Designed By You, Alucard  and more Knights of Colombus Aug 21   SUICIDE MACHINES  w/  Planet Smashers ,  Just Ask , and  The Transfer  Sept 18 Clutch Cargos  Sounds fun.  adios

      Well, I checked out who was playing at the Warped Tour this year in detroit to see if i maybe wanted to go. Here are the bands i would for sure go see:   Bouncing Souls      The Casualties      Avenged Sevenfold       Planetsmashers      Silence The Wake      Bowling For Soup      Half the Battle      From Here on Out      Before I Go      The Rivercity Rebels     It really makes my day to see bands like Silence The Wake, Half The Battle, and From Here On Out, and Before I Go hit the Warped tour. These are bands I saw at the Knights of Colombus or other local venues, just trying to get heard. I am really happy to see them getting on the Warped Tour, they deserve it. :)  So now im thinking about it, and if i can spare the cash i think i might go.  Oh yea, I caught a glimpse of the new Rivercity Rebels site, and wow, at first on the home page the pic is racy and funny, and I didnt think much of it, but if you get further into the site...i cant believe they dont have an 18 and up disclaimer haha, watch out little ones!

      I went to Murray Lake today, which I havent been to in awhile.  Me and my dad fished, I caught like 2 and he caught about 9327123879012879359812305.  So, I got disappointed and just said "screw it" so we went back to the other lake (Murray Lake is two lakes), and went for a swim at around 8:30.  I have been going to Murray Lake since I was in my mother's womb, so there are alot of memories there.  So, it was fun.  My mom always seems to be out late, she is probably partying or something haha.  I notice nobody comments anymore.  Feel free to comment on anything, maybe even right now just to see if anybody even reads this :/....

      9miles2go concert:  I met Aimee and her friend Heather there :) . The first band was decent (called Vegas, from Ohio), but the vox sounded like a mix of New Found Glory and Dashboard. 9miles2go was good as usual. What they played first was the intro to  "Hey"  by  The Suicide Machines,  then instead of going into the ska part, they switched to one of their songs, which was pretty neat. Afterwards, aimee and heather left then this goth kid kept looking at me so I asked "what?" and he asked who was the girl i was talking to with the black tank top (Heather), cause his friend had the hots for her. Then his friend said "No that wasnt me, he's the one that likes her!" So it was awesomly mature, as you can see....  So, I finally got ahold of the actual copy of Fill In The Blanks by 9M2G, I had the test copy but they never sent me the real one.  My cousin said his other band was having a sweet show on the 21st with  Before I Go  and  Alucard  (I really miss Alucard, they could really bring the mosh, same goes for Before I Go) and some others at a Knights of Colombus. I really like the local hall shows at the Knights of Colombus, a suprising amount of people show up for the bands maybe 100 or more...and it is really fun, cause you encounter alot of new bands as well. But yea, I'm gonna go to that.  That's all for now.

      There is a concert tonite at 8 at the music go round in the novi town center, it's the closest so far 9miles2go has played to Livonia, it's about 15 minutes away, and its only like 3 dollars...so go!  Need directions call or something. pretty much take 96W till you get to the Novi/Walled Lake exit...its somewhere around there....  I can't take any people cause I get off work at 8 and I need to shower and then I am leaving, but it will be ok cause they dont hit the stage till 9 or so.  It's not far away so if you got nothing better to do, you should go!

      If it wasnt for the damn fire marshall reducing the minimum amount of people allowed in The Shelter I would be at the Lawrence Arms show right now...>_  I am debating going to Warped Tour...if there is no other concert this month then I will go...but next year I want to go out of state so I can see NOFX, because Fat Mike hates michigan for some reason.  It's a shitload of money though, and 90 percent of the bands suck...eh...I'm gonna think about it...Marty said he would go, and Nick wants to too I think...  I went to the aimee's house today.  We watched Anger Management and Forrest Gump...haha..."I got bit in the butt-ocks"...It was a good time :)  Well, Evan never called because he was busy...gah...  peace

      Well, remember in the Rock Against Bush Vol. 2 post I mentioned how Green Day hasn't been up to much?  Apparently they are, I just never took the time to check.  As a matter a fact, you their new cd is coming out Sept 21, and they will hit the radio this Tuesday august 3rd!  I really missed those guys...That was the second concert I went to, the Pop Disaster tour with Green Day and Blink 182.  And of course I lost my concert virginity to Weird Al.  haha.  Well, from the sounds of the music snippets they sound like the true blue pop punk songs like Green Day always stuck with.  For more visit their  urlLink site , which will be changed into a new one in a few days.

      well, I am doing some cd copying for friends.  I'm having a hard time sleeping.  So I fall asleep at like 4, wake up at 2....to awake to fall asleep earlier....cant fall asleep till 4....wake up at 2....and so on.  Somedays I get up earlier and it still doesnt help.  I just cant sleep.  Lawrence Arms tomorrow, it is looking kinda doubtful :-/   The March Of The Elephants  is one of my favorites off of The Greatest Story Ever Told by The Lawrence Arms.  Actually, I like alot of that cd.  Still no call from evan about practice...blah

      Well, today since band practice never gained momentum, marty, aimee, amber and I went to the movies, at Emagine. We saw Napoleon Dynamite. aimee and i liked it but marty and amber didnt. I thought it was really goofy and funny, and reminded me of high school.  Afterwards amber drove us back to aimee's house and then she left to take a nap. Meanwhile we went to blockbuster, and got Gothika despite aimees strong dislike of scary movies. Amber showed up back at her house and we watched it.  I barely pulled off getting home at my curfew, but it was fun. Just to prove to you how  hot  it was, here is a very nice pic taken via a picture booth thing at the movie theater    urlLink    Marty and I going into uncharted territory...  urlLink     Can you feel the  love  tonite?      Man, if I have a tumor or something growing from that spot or like a rash....well...then i know where that came from...
