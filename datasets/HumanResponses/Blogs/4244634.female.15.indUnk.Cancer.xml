        sooo...kevin calls me @ like 11:00am today & expects me to be awake, hahah right. then tara calls @ 1:00pm (smart girl) &amp; we make plans to meet & such &amp; such. we ended up going to lower & running into kevin &amp; john & clay &amp; sean & james &amp; some hippie...pretty cool..they got a bunch of weed then ditched us for an hour then came back & we all smoked a lotta weed &amp; it was good, then just me & tara &amp; kevin went up the hill, met up with ace, ohh man chris was there & he was so mad cuz he thought he was gonna get some pussy from me that night but i shot him down &amp; went out with kevin ahhahahahahahaha loser so yeah he didnt really talk to me or kevin much, just said hi, but he wasnt there long so yeah good. then we went & smoked another joint behind the mall & then when my mom got off work she was like all looking @ me funny &amp; then she goes "you're eyes are messed up.  i know you have been smoking marijuana cigarettes." like dude whaaaat the fuck. who talks like that!? but whatever, i went home then todd makes me go out & smoke more weeeeed hahah so im baked right now, HOWEVER. dont get the wrong idea. im not a harsh chronic. just a normal person who likes to indulge in a little grass once in a while  (more like almost everyday)  its not like i 'need' it  (i get all twitchy when i havent smoked up in a few days)  and i could stop whenever i want  (IM NEVER GONNA STOP) . ganja's bad for you, it wrecks your childhood memories &amp; your brain cells & it fucks up your lungs. dont buy into peer pressure!!! i wish i hadnt tried that first hoot with JC in the back forest behind the mall on june 28th '03. but i thought maybe, for once, i could be cool.  (((k kids, bottom line, all that shit i just said, was shit.    Smoke Weed Everyday.)))
