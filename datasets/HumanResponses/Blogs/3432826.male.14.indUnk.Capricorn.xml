         Our group has lived for a long time, never given up. Some people might of quit, but we still got some back-ups. You feeling me? Been in this group for about two and a half years, wow, never thought ill be interested in this crew.    This group perform in a traditional time of year. FALKLIfE!!! Yes, Falklife, the month of laughter, fun, and music. Every summer we have this place, where all the dance crews in every country in the world, perform in one place, to entertain our peers and us. Without this, life would be nothing but sand in the beach. ahaha!^_^    Not only in Falklife, places like B-day parties, regular parties, and even the holidays we perfrom! It's great to meet new people and represent our hood from our cultural dances. HEHE.    This group captures everyeones eyes, asking how we do it, asking why we do it. It's all about the FLIPS! We represent AZNPRIDE! Amazing what we can do, lol.  [fixing]

      A WISH  I lie on the ground, and stare into space, the stars start to move, into the shape of your face.  I see you there now, looking down at me, with the cute little smile, that i like to see.  You say "close your eyes" "tell me what you see" i see only two people, just you and me.  We're walking the shoreline, with our feet getting wet, the horizon turns pink, as the sun starts to set.  We make love through the night, on that white sandy shore, then i hold you while thinking, I could want nothing more.  Oh I wish I could be, in that one special place, as I lie on the ground, and I stare into space...  As Long As You're Near  The first time we met I could see, That you and I were meant to be. Your eyes were so gentle, Your smile so true, When you first held my hand I just knew.  Now the time has gone by Through laughter and tears, These days I shall cherish for years upon years.  Those memories we have shall never fade, For those are the steps that we have made. That was the past, The future is near, I anxiously wait for what will appear. New homes, more laughter, children so dear,  Everything will be wonderful as long as you're near.    -for, you see, each day i love you more, today more than yesterday and less than tomorrow. -grow old along with me the best is yet to be -i love you not only for what you are, but for what i am when i am with you -as we grow older together, as we continue to change with age, the is one thing that will never change...i will always keep falling in love with you. -as i stand here today with the world as my witness, i pledge to you my undying and everlasting love, i will stand beside you as your partner, i will stand before you as you protector, and i will stand behind you as you solace, pleace spend and end our life together.   you wouldn't listen even if i told you  who the fuck am i to say  you to busy with the lies they sold you another cure to fix you day  open wide for all the shit they feed you  while the the defecates  and blindly walk where ever they will lead you  while the edges slowly fray...

      I don't know what i was thinking 'til i was thinking of you I don't remember a thing before i opened my eyes And you came into view I don't know what i was doing When there was nothing to do Must've been waiting for someone, e86 Now i can see - i was waiting for you  I'd give up my sight just to see you I'd beg, i would borrow and steal I'd cut off my hands just to touch you And tear out my heart so you'd know how i feel There's nowhere that i wouldn't follow There's nothing that i wouldn't do 'cause i wouldn't wanna be me If i didn't have you  Driving myself to destruction Until you got in my way I was just whistling dixie 'til you struck up the  band And they started to play I don't know how i was living Until you came in my life I always knew there was something wrong Then you came along baby, you made it right  I was alone in the silence 'til i was hearing your voice I couldn't see my way clear until you parted the  clouds And you gave me a choice I couldn't pick up the pieces 'til i was falling apart I didn't know i was bleeding 'til your love fixed this hole, baby, here in my  heart  I'd give up my sight just to see you I'd beg, i would borrow and steal I'd cut off my hands just to touch you And tear out my heart so you'd know how i feel There's nowhere that i wouldn't follow There's no place that i'd rather be This life without you would be hollow This love is a gift, and you gave it to me All that i am, you have made me And baby, i know that it's true I'd give it all up in a heartbeat Just to spend every moment with you There's no place that i wouldn't follow There's nothing that i wouldn't do 'cause i wouldn't wanna be me If i didn't have you  ....i enjoy the knowledge that we will make it  through, no matter what happens ....the words come so easy now, i love you .... and i always will. eightysix
