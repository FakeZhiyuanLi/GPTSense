      mood: *blowing nosey listening to: nothing  Shall not say what I might want to say about the band only that hello? Liz? I can play guitar too? BAH HUMBUG. Anyway I'm trying to be a more quiet and less mean person. Although that may be quite impossible...ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.  Number One on To-Do List: Get a tagboard up.   I think the band idea is good. Only if everyone is willing to commit. Then we gotta find a place and a time too. I think it will be fun...as long as everyone contributes. Wheehoo.   I take mardi to mean monday and mercredi to mean tuesday? what language is that, greek? (hahaha)  yes, friday! i shall take the liberty to post details! well we end school at 2 PM earliest...hoping nothing goes wrong with our progress reports AGAIN...we'll go to Suntec or Great World City (as they are more ulu places and we'll have more of the place to ourselves) to watch Shrek2, The Day After Tomorrow, Troy (again) or whatever movie that looks favourable. Okay? Can't wait.  And...I love that pic of us!! It's, wow, RECENT!! Hahahaha. Now everyone can see why we're the rectangular table of ladies. Plus I love the cups and the one ton of mee bowl there. HEEHEE.

      mood: stoning listening to: There is None Like You  Okay actually Michelle was supposed to do the first part, but since she hasn't, I'll do the first part and you do the second part okay michelle?? I can't hold it in any longer. _____________________________________________________________________  The date is the twenty-sixth of June. The day is Saturday. The time is 6.00 PM. He sits in the MRT that has just reached Changi Airport MRT Station. The doors have long since opened, leaving the way for him unobstructed. The only obstacle in his way now is making the decision.  He has made it thus far, out of his house and down the entire MRT line to get to the airport. And now, it is so difficult just to take the few steps out of the train. His mind is in turmoil. He is struggling with his feelings. What should he do? Sitting right across from the open doors, he toys with his handphone. He knows all the details: Terminal 1, Gate 16, Flight QF 6. All he needs is the willpower to get there. It's so easy. He just has to stand up and march out of this train which is going to close its doors at any minute.  Why did he ever come? It was so stupid. He didn't care anymore. She'd never notice if he was there or not. All he would accomplish would be making a fool of himself. But he'd admitted to himself, he was still madly in love with her. He couldn't let her go just like that. She was still very much a part of him.  Just remembering how much she meant to him gave him renewed courage and boldness. Adrenaline flooded his body as he stood up and made a dash through the adjoining carriages and out the door.  I'm coming,  he thought to her,  wait for me.  ___________________________________________________________________  For part two, BUG MICHELLE TAN FOR IT!!! The true story will be revealed after part two. Stay tuned!

      mood:perfect 10 listening to:stewed beef haha.. i just a great inspiration to write an article abt the most happening stuff going on.. guess.. oh anw.. its the hunk array.. EURO2004!!!!  here goes: crazy abt euro2004 but the irony of me having the inability to catch any of the soccer mania. How frustrating!!! oh ofcourse i have to admit part of the desire of watching it is to fulfill every girl's satisfaction.  the HUNK APPETITE! hahaha... i mean, face it. a girl will always be a girl at heart. you see a suave-looking guy, u get a bit a tipsy. isn't true?? uless you're abnormal swooning over the wrong gender. oh don't u fid euro200 a reality show for choosing the most all rounded perfect model guy for choices of husband. awesome looks! deeeeep pockets for you enjoy the exqusite treasures and pleasures of the world (pls be reminded these articles are to taken lightly. Christian value: store our treasures in heaven not earth hor...) and lastly a stable income. if you're jobless, no fear. you have a huge bank acct behind you. and with your hubby's excellent soccer skills (i.e ronaldino), you don't have to further frown over your boy's future.  Just ask him to hone the skills from his father and wa-la u've produced a line a of superb soccer players. this applies for any marriage between you and a famous sport personnel hor... but euro2004 isn't only abt the hotties. it is also abt enjoying the thilling action and the intense anticipation of the heart-pounding football matches.  Once a striker is on fire, you start to slowly lift your butt of the couch and cheer and chant"goal goal goal" but usually 85% of the time its a false alarm.  Then let's say that Owen scores for England, the crowd automatically makes a joyful din. you'll hear things like" YES!" "GOAL Ah!! or the most annoying " YAY!! Money Come..." hahahaha.. don't you quite agree with me? especially the ah jeks, always say " ai seh! sui sui sia!" "hao qiu! da de hao! lai he jiu he jiu!" i have then termed euro2004 a hypertension-giver, heart-atacker-starter and a world of fantasies.  euro2004 makes people go boloney!! However i have to strongly reccomend euro2004. if u're looking for some good clean action-packed enjoyment, switch on the tv late at night tune to channel 5 and pumpthe adreline.  and a word of unholy advice, place your bets on any england germany and france and germany matches, they play well.  soak into the fever of euro2004 dears!!!  editor, cowwie

      mood: thoughtful listening to: n.e.r.d - she wants to move  Hey people! I sent this to your inbox too, but just for public preview, here's another copy. It's really worth pondering!  Why do you believe in God when you have never see, touch, hear, feel and smell God?  An atheist professor of philosophy speaks to his class on the problem science has with God, the Almighty.   He asks one of his new Christian students to stand and.....  Professor: You are a Christian, aren't you, son?   Student :  Yes, sir.  Prof: So you believe in God?   Student : Absolutely, sir.  Prof: Is God good?   Student : Sure.  Prof: Is God all-powerful?   Student : Yes.  Prof: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to God to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But God didn't.   How is this God good then? Hmm?  (Student is silent.)  Prof: You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?   Student :Yes.  Prof: Is Satan good?   Student : No.  Prof: Where does Satan come from?   Student : From...God...  Prof: That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world?   Student : Yes.  Prof: Evil is everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything. Correct?   Student : Yes.  Prof: So who created evil?   (Student does not answer.)  Prof: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don't they?   Student :Yes, sir.  Prof: So, who created them?   (Student has no answer.)  Prof: Science says you have 5 senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Tell me, son...Have you ever seen God?   Student:   No, sir.  Prof: Tell us if you have ever heard your God?   Student : No , sir.  Prof: Have you ever felt your God, tasted your God, smelt your God? Have you ever had any sensory perception of God for that matter?   Student : No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't.  Prof: Yet you still believe in Him?   Student : Yes.  Prof: According to empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your GOD doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?   Student : Nothing. I only have my faith.  Prof: Yes. Faith. And that is the problem science has.   Student : Professor, is there such a thing as heat?  Prof: Yes.   Student : And is there such a thing as cold?  Prof: Yes.   Student : No sir. There isn't.   The lecture theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events.)  Student : Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don't have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.   (There is pin-drop silence in the lecture theatre.)  Student : What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness?   Prof: Yes. What is night if there isn't darkness?  Student : You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light....But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and  it's called darkness, isn't it? In reality, darkness isn't. If it were you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?   Prof: So what is the point you are making, young man?  Student : Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed.   Prof: Flawed? Can you explain how?  Student : Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good God and a bad God.You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure.Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?   Prof: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.  Student :  Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?   (The Professor shakes his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.)  Student : Since no one has ever observed the process of  evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavour,  are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher?   (The class is in uproar.)  Student : Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor's brain?   (The class breaks out into laughter.)  Student : Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor's brain, felt it, touched or smelt it?.....No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir?   (The room is silent. The professor stares at the student, his face unfathomable.)  Prof: I guess you'll have to take them on faith, son.   Student : That is it sir.. The link between man & god is FAITH. That is all that keeps things moving & alive.   God bless you!

YAY! but i'm leaving for camp tomorrow .. grrs! and i'll be rushed off for the next one on monday.. can't even get a decent rest.. this one the yLC ends on suday.. late afternoon and the st john's lsland one on monday.. :|  today went out with sharon! want to really thank her.. she's really ice you know. though she had to meet her friends but she still accompanied me and tried to make me feel included. TQ sharon! haha.. ate at yoshinoya.. quite yummy but i was full the rice's really filling. i bet sharon will agree with me :) then we went on to but my 1litre water bottle.. it's transparent with a bluish tinge.. i love it! haha and it's really reasonable - $4.90.. better than the expensive ones at the sporting shops. hehe. i'm thrifty. :) anyways. we went to marche's for awhile to join her friends.. they are ex-ny .. 6H really lame and crappy and funny.. the usual. but it's weet that they still have class gatherings. my class doesn't anymore or not that i know of :P  wells got to go maybe i will go and swim.. the water looks really inviting.. bye!

      mood:a poached potato listening to:* u guys wldn't believe* Josh Groban  hahaha... this is the first time i have posted something eversince this blog has been set up. pretty cool~ dadada... oh well somehow i never seem to catch the action at the tagboard.. pretty disheartening.. dotz.. anyway i just told jia hui to shut up online as this post marks my prescence in this blog rather than existing there as cowwie.. oh man guess what i just the groban cd and have ben listening to it for the 5th consecutive night.. very soothing.. to all those who think i am a die-hard rock and pop fan.. music is music... a very exquisite formof art that is very and widely appreciated globally.. well well don't i feel like a philosopher here... hehehe... just want to make a an obvious comment abt the days.. it is bloody hot *british slang* these feel days.. my mood describes it all..actually i don't think a potato describes it all.. it's like being barbequed or grilled to perfection. well a slab of meat=sharon.  oh last night i have made a very life-changing decision.. i've decided to marry a Japanese CHEF!!!! i figured i am so in love with the Japanese cuicine and i am dead set on marrying a  chef of rich Japanese culinary skills.  Oh then in exchange i will just buy the ready-to-make mac-cheese. it's an all-time-favourite!!! then to continue.. i will also teach him many other dishes of mine.  like the simple steamed brocolli with braised oyster sauce with meat chips in it. take note my husband has to an authentic japanese chef.. strictly japanese. the respoosibility of introducing mew styles of dishes will be selfidhly mine. then withmy vivid ad wild imagination/creatvity together we will set up a restaurant selling fusion food trying to pry open the tight doors of japanese fast food.  then i figured we will be the next Mcd or Burger King or KFC or maybe defeating the champions of local japanese fast fod oulets such as Mos Burger and Yoshinoya.  my ideas are flooding my head.. there are of course more dishes stirring within my brain other than the 2 silly diishes of vegetables and macaroni.. although i may seem to appear wonderously ignorant to the cooking world that all women are supposedly to explore it once.  i also learn from my best companion my mother. she cooks well only to a dismay of mine that i am like that. so uninterested in doing the preparation and cleaning up. i am only well trained in messing things up therefore my special cullinary skill is stir-fry.  it's like tossing and turning lifeting the pan abit just to show off.  getting the fire onto the food only ends up in the food being badly burnt.well that's why i need a chef as a husband. well this very short "article" only goes to show my business-like mind.  and my business i have set up such as the make-shift tampons and pads cart-shops have failed terribly due to negligence and over-sight.  before i end i have something very important to annouce. i will hereby appoint myself as the editor of wacky and absurd news of this very prestigious blog of the royal LADIES OF THE RECTANGULAR TABLE. aiya i cahngedthe order but it makes sense. that's all for now. signing off!!

      mood: hyper and very, very happy listening to: silence  hey guys!! i just went for the soweto gospel choir concert and it just about rocked!! the africans were so enthusiastic in their dancing and singing it just about made me want to jump out of me seat and dance with them! (which, in fact, i did, which caused a lot of embarrassment, but if you want, i can tell the story.)  anyway i'm honoured to be the almighty saver of springy onions!! they're victims worthy of saving!! because they add flavour to tofu!! and once again, happy birthday sharon!!   for all of you who missed it..."nyeah nyeah nyeah" - quote lizlaw.  hope you all are doing fine and please pray for Louisa as she jets off to Thailand...sawadika!!

      mood: anxious listening to: bye bye bye - nsync  people please pray for the sky and that it won't rain tonight or my church youth and me are gonna get soaked when we go night cycling and then we'll all just fall sick and everyone will be upset because we were all looking forward to this night so badly so let's just pray that it doesn't rain and that God blows all the clouds away yarh?  anyway haha i shall say everything in ultra long sentences today without punctuation for which the english teachers will murder me but what do i care anyway so glad sze finally got in and yeah it's true i was pretending to be enraptured in the music by closing my eyes and frowning slightly to feign intensity - but really i was just trying to sleep discreetly mwahaha and somehow sze was in love with soursop last night soursop drink and soursop desert and then when she ordered she asked for sourSOAP so the cashier was like huh and we were laughing so badly so that was last night.  so now we're only pending sharon michelle christine louisa and grace you guys better hurry up and join this blog before your invite expires yeah hope to see you all at sharon's party on the third till then take care!

      mood: *blowing nosey AGAIN listening to: some dumb holly valance song  very dao mei. everytime got english exam (midyear, new south wales and oral) i get a stupid nose problem. i need a nose transplant. anyone wanna offer?  updates about the ACJC Choir Concert...holey moley (our juniors' nickname for s.ho) tied up her hair and wore contacts so we didn't recognize her at first. she bought us seats so close to the front we suspected she wanted to keep an eye on us (THIRD ROW FROM THE FRONT). teachers that went: miss lum, miss ho wai yu, miss shen, mr chan, mr soh, miss yeo, the cheena woman and our Grace conductresses. yeowch.  it was okay larh...miss ho sang so damn high and loud you could hear her distinctly...and coz i was in an anti-s.ho mood i thot she was so damn showing off. but all in all it was quite a good performance. acjc choir does have a good reputation...and it was worth the money.  so! we're going for sharon's birthday bash?!?! too bad no hairy potter and POA. hope u all are going. coz i am. mwahaha.  have a good day people!

      mood: terrible listening to: the silence in my room. for once without feeling any akwardness &nbsp; People, this is gonna be a hurtful post but theses are the things and feelings I've kept pent up inside myself for long enough. I cant put this at my blog because it is under CONSTANT scrutiny for posts like this. Finally I've found someone who's more in love with my computer than me! WOW! And what more who LOVES my email account more than me! Maybe it was an accident or maybe it was intentional. For all of you who don't know, I have this thing on my com where all you have to do to sign in on msn is to click on my add. So after her ROYAL HIGHNESS finished with her daily hogging of my computer, I found the msn signed in to MY account. Like ok... Some of you may think I'm being childish some of you may think I'm being immature but Im really tired. For 2 days I've been trying very hard but no, all I get is SILENCE. That's IT! I can't tell you all this in school nor do i think I can keep this in till next week without going mad. So here's it. all you guys have been seeing for the past few days is just a facade. Anyway I cant blame her for using my com so often coz maybe thats the only way for her to stay in touch with hong kong but yeah. She's extreamly homesick so someone give me some solutions. God, help me.&nbsp; Sorry guys if this looks like a private blog post but as i said, my blog is being visited EVERY other hour... Even when Im in the room. Like freaky. For more info on why i said that, go read my tag board. I'm too freaked to reply....

      mood: dazed listening to:maroon5 alb its been a long time eversince i published any articles.. today i'll treat u ppl to one.&nbsp; i just met with an accident on the way home.&nbsp; i just finished speech day rehearsal and doddled my way home.&nbsp; just when i finished crossing the bridge i saw this cement truck approaching.&nbsp; i knew that big monster machine will bring along flying sand and dust particles&nbsp; whirling right into my face and legs. i decided to take cover under my arms.&nbsp; i stood there rooted to the ground face tucked under my shoulder crunching up the left side of my body.&nbsp; i felt the tagling sensation of sand rubbing past my ankles.&nbsp; suddenly, WHAM!!! there was this big explosion in my head!! i was totally shocked stunned.&nbsp; it was like a hollow rock had just hit me like a slow-motion meteroid.&nbsp; hahaha... at this point i shouldn't be laughing but as i write this recount i really find it funny.. pardon me my ladies.&nbsp; i had delayed reaction and exclaimed a loud "ow!!" heard above the roaring truck rumbling by.&nbsp; i looked up to see who the hell was that imp!!&nbsp; to my utter amazement, it was this short woman looking equally pale holding the top of her head! hahaha.. the sight was so comical!&nbsp; my face, i guessed it was screwed up by the unexpected 'bomb'.&nbsp; i think i might have looked pissed and angry but at that time i was like going "who is that stupid kid??"&nbsp; but it turned to be an adult.. -_-'''&nbsp; so i just stared at her as she continued her way to the bus-stop rubbing her crown!! hahaha... *pPppPpPpp..&nbsp; so i didn't what to do either having being knocked on and made my way home.&nbsp; i too had sub-consciously left my hand on my right side of my head and walked on. at the bus-stop the st. francis kids had eyes that were dyingto know what the hell had just happened to cause me in polka dots to rub my head.&nbsp; there was this guy or girl i couldn't make out shim had breast but none.&nbsp; shim was following my every movement finally i felt so awkward and said this in total embarrassment "please stop looking at me like that. thanks"&nbsp; and just strode off.&nbsp; and the last thing could happen did.&nbsp; don't i didn't fall, not that 'suay'..&nbsp; my bottle hanging from my bag hit the pillar causing a big clang!!&nbsp; it startled me and i jumped.. i mean like being frightened by myelf making a mistake.. oh no.. i AM so humilaited today but i guess things like that do happen to everyone.&nbsp; i think i am not the only one to have done such a silly thing.&nbsp; i mean like how many people collide with each other by one just standing and walking??&nbsp; its so weird and unusual.. then it was like i don't know.. oh well i figure i am the only one who make such accidents happen.. like the one at hereen bus-stop. oh that one.. it will live with me for life!! =\ but let this be lesson to stop further into the side ofthe path just in case someone knocks right into you.. scary..
