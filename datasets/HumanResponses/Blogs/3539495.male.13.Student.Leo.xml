      Bob Dylan's concert ticket sales went on sale Saturday. Get them at www.ticketmaster.com  Did you know that AC/DC's latest concert (which was a couple months ago) sold out in three minutes?

       urlLink    Spent Saturday listening to this at my Grandma's cause I had nothing else to do. It's actually a pretty good CD. Lots of people are yelling about how 1/4 of the songs are covers, but they're good covers. Also has one original song ("Don't Cry") and a version of "November Rain". But, I think that "Appetite for Destruction" was a better album. Too bad they basically disbanded...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Now these are good headphones. Made by Sony these cans cost 90 bucks. Thats really the only setback to them. Lots of money. But aside from that, the come with nice comfy ear pads, the sound quality is supposedly excellent, and they're light. They are also foldable, small enough to fit into a jacket pocket easily. The bass is a little lighter than most headphones, but an equalizer solves that problem. Sold at www.audiocubes.com . Sony discontinued making these, so they're in limited stock. Which reminds me I need money soon...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    My new CD player. Really cool. Gleam black. 50 Hours of battery life, Bookmarking, digital mega bass, 23 mm thick. The clip on remote is handy too, but the upgrades and look compared from the old Psyc really makes it worth the fifty dollars. But the headphones...they suck. So...&nbsp; urlLink

      Hmmm, havent written in a while. Just to clear things up, i bugged my mom long enough to let me go to Canobie. That was fun, got wet, got ditched, got bored. You know, everythings so much money there. I swear to god, you can buy a cup of ice cream for the same price of half a gallon of ice cream from the supermarket. Cousins came over, we talked for a while. They never come... but anyways. Missed Alex's party, that was supposed to be fun. But at least i skirted another encounter with death. I burned so many cds over the weekend, Guns n Roses, Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Bob Dylan. Now my cd case's heavier, makes me feel good. Which reminds me... BOB DYLANS COMING TO BROCKTON!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tickets arent for sale yet, but the European tour tickets are. 52 dollars, quite a bargain if I do say so myself. So, I might just go on the Germany tour. Just wont understand what the announcer person is saying. But i really cant wait. Bob Dylan is the man. Heres the site to get the info, http://bobdylan.com/live/. In fact, I'm listening to his cd right now to commerate this joyous day. WHOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      You know, when we had homework, everyone was like "Argghh i hate homework, i wish i never had any" and we were occupied the entire day. Now that we don't have any homework, its like "Argh, i wish i had something to do". I mean at least thats what im feeling right now. I have a feeling that this summer is probably going to go byreally really slowly...

      woohhooo, todays the last normal friday of the skool year. ohhhh yahhh. ms. tozzi's last day today. shes a good teacher (my best math teacher), but you know wat that means? NO MORE MATH!!!!!!!!!!! yayayayayay! but you know, the substitues probably just going to go "well, lets take a look at the ap calculus book just for kicks. hey, this doesnt look to hard. 1-50 for homework tonight!". i completely screwered up my computer today. i was looking through it (i mean, inside the tower), and then when i turned it on, it just wouldn't load up. queer. so i just activated a system restore point and now everythings ok. wahaha. i know this is against my ethics, but the only show that i will ever watch that is exclusively owned by G4 is gphoria, and thats only because it has a lot of interviews with developers. all those other shows suck ass...  listening to: Smells Like Teen Spirit; Nirvana

      wow, im really tired. went to sleep at like 1:30 last night. at least theres no more projects! woohoooo. Anyways, i just lost so much space on my hard drive, like 700 megs. Thats what u get for installing illegally downloaded stuff thats supposed to cost 500 dollars. i hate french so much. i mean, its just so pointless. yah, like im going to go around in Sudbury talking to everybody in french... i hate tech ed too. its boring pointless and all we do is make drawings. but we had a sub at least  marc: you know, you could have said no! (marc referring to a kid who got asked out by a girl) ******:welll... sub: heres some advice, never say no to a girl marc: well, what if its a fat ugly sped girl who bitches all the time? sub: NEVER SAY NO!  yup. sub giving out dating advice. at lunch patrick was treating his red frozen juice pop that had melted like a weapon and threw it at people. then, after he had his fun, he opened it up, drank a little and started to go to the bathroom. alex grabbed him before he walked into the door squeezed the little plastic tubing. most of the red stuff landed on his patch like on his crotch. it looked like he attempted to screw a woodchipper. so, whenever u see gogan, call him woodchipper or pms.

      Whether your left wing or right wing, republican or democrat, conservatism or liberal, almost anybody can agree that Ronald Reagan was the best President. He led one of the best times that our economy ever had, handled war with ease, and negotiated for American hostages like it was a walk in the park. He gave a stunning and moving speech to the survivors of D-Day and was just a guy that you really could relate to. The fact that he had alzheimers makes his death seem even more sadder. So, here's to the number one President of the United States of America. Here's to Ronald Reagan! *clink*  http://apnews.myway.com/image/20040607/RONALD_REAGAN.sff_CACC101_20040607145156.html?date=20040607&docid=D832BKSO0

      You know what i hate? When you go to dinner or have lunch at school or somwthing of the like, and someone takes ur seat! Its so freakin annoying and weird too. And its even more annoying when the person refuses to move, no matter how many death threats you give out. Yah, I like fell out of my seat at dinner today. I dunno, maybe somethings all messed up with me...  Stuck in my head: Another Brink in the Wall-Pink Floyd

      you know what pisses me off? G4. Sure they have everything about gaming and stuff that you really don't need to know, but now they have to suck one of the most prestigous tech channels, techTV, into their grips. They've stripped the channel of their best shows, ie Call For Help (Call For Help was by far the best show that techTV had ever aired and Leo was the man. Check out his blog  urlLink here ), taken down all the archives of the channel, and refuse to air new episodes of the shows that were on the original techTV. Geez, this makes me mad. And seriously, who wants to watch Girls Gone Wired? G4's turned techTV into something else entirely.

      Been in Germany for three days now. Flight over here was nice, there was a tv and some movies to watch, so it went by pretty fast. I stopped in London for like four hours. Really really bored. So I just passed the time listening to my walkman. The guys that were supposed to be escorting me because I was a minor didn’t look very happy. Aparently he had better things to do. But it makes me feel special when u got a person in a suit walking with you . Anyways I slept on the flight from London to Germany. Didn’t even get up while we were landing. So my ears hurt after I woke up. Like when I sneezed, they hurt and I was like “Jesus fucking Christ!” When I was waiting for my uncle of course.     The weather changes like every hour. Im inside and I look out, and its sunny. Then I want to go out for a walk, its raining. Then we go out to buy some stuff from the supermarket, and its sunny. Pisses me off.     Yup. And when people talk to me in German I have to go like “No German” and shake my head. Then they go, “Oh, you American, u Bush”. And then I either walk away or go ”No Bush”. So it gets kinda awkward.    Theres no one my age around here either. Everyones either under ten or like eighteen. I mean, not like i would be able to communicate with them.     We went swimming today. It was fun, there were water slides and stuff at the outside pool. Thank god it was heated. The temperature here is like fifty degrees. Really cold. But you know what I don’t get. Why cant kids go into the sauna. Seriously theres always a rule that says kids cant go there. I mean jeez, we’re not retards and going to get suffocated in there. Well, some people might. But survival of the fittest right. If you get yourself killed in the sauna, you’re just too stupid to live. Just joking. But there is nothing to do here after dinner. I could watch tv, but people yelling in a language I just don’t really understand makes me turn it off. Watched the euro cup finals though. Great match with Portugal against Greece. Dial -up connection and its going really slow. so im gone.

      Went to Six Flags yesterday. That was fun. Went on all the coasters except for Superman (my brother got scared) and most of the dizzy rides. The water park was pretty cool too. Wave pools are the best! You feel like you get drowned, then you come up, then you go down, then the lifeguard yells at you, repeat until you get kicked out (happened to me once). Speaking of lifeguards, i had a conversation with one. This was basically how it went:  Me: Hey Mr. Lifeguard, thanks for guarding over... Him: We're not opening the pool for another fifteen minutes dippy.  Today i figured out how to rip Velvet Revolvers "Contraband" CD. Its copyprotected, so Im really proud of doing it on the first try. Take that SunnComm! Muahahaha no one can stop pirates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       urlLink    Watched a couple movies this week. First: The Village. Really really good movie. Its a kind of schycological stuff, plays with your mind a lot. There are a lot of twists in the plot, and the end result is completely different from what the original story began with. The Village isn't scary like Signs, instead there are some shocking moments that might make you jump, but there is a lot of talking. I think that its better than m.night's other movies, but thats just me. A very excellent movie. In fact, you should go out and watch it right now... Second: The Last Samurai. Another good movie. This takes place in Japan where the Emperor wants to industrialize his country. The agreement is shaken by a rebellion of people in the mountains who have stuck to the old traditions. The man character (played by Cruise) is captured by the samurai and he eventually joins them. The cinematography is excellent, the slow motion in some scenes helps the mood and the landscape is beautifully chosen. The acting is pretty good too (better than average for cruise). The ending though does spoil the tone of the movie. But there were Asian people in it, thats gotta count for something. The last movie I watched was Fahrenheit 911. Its not actually a movie, but it was interesting. Personally, I think Michael Moore is crazy about putting a movie like this out, but its gonna hurt Bush's votes and im done pretending to be a movie critic.  urlLink

       Havent written in this for a while. Keep putting it off. Figured out how to put links in the side! Yay, im so happy. Got  Contraband  and  AC/DC Live  from the Gooch. Great CDs. Velvet Revolver shows real rock, and  Live  is better than I expected of a, well, live CD. Went to Chinatown today, there was this festival and traffic was a bitch. But the show was pretty cool, with the dancing dragons and some stands selling pirated and fake stuff. Got my computer too. It's a pretty good one from Dell. hehe now i get this one for myself. Whooo. Hope my dad doesnt install a netnanny thingy on it. I dont wanna get caught again... Modded my entire system. Now everything looks like hitman. Hitman windowblinds, hitman clock, hitman logon, hitman bootscreen, hitman screensaver. Super cool. But its all is black. So it hurts to look after a while.  Thats all...
