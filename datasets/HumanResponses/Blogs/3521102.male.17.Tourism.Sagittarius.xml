      Geez....I nearly forgot that I had this blog like 5 minutes ago I was like oh yeah I really should post a new blog so....here I am. I want to go and paint the Bat Cave tonight but I don't have a ride home so I'm porbably gonna have to stay here all day. I've recently started skateboarding and I'm not very good at all but if I want to get better I have to keep on looking over my shoulder for the cops, because its now against the law to skateboard without a helmet FUCK I HATE THE COPS!!!!!!! whats next? You can't play soccer without chin guards? No Baseball without cleets? I mean what the fuck all a helmet is, is opional equipment if I want to risk brain damage for a good time then it should be my fucking choice.....CHRIST!!!!! oh well now that im all pissed off I'm gonna go shoot something.

      Yep....Here is the first post of many....probably....not. Today I went to Marks and we cleaned up the Bat Cave some, and Mark wrote The Super Duper Bandits next single...Frank the Manitee.I've nearly   got the ollie down pat. I think tomorrow we are gonna go and get a stereo and get Dave to hook up some sort of stereo system in the Bat Cave.We are all gonna go camping in a couple weeks so that will be pretty fun, fires and alcohol don't normally mix but we'll have to see what happens.It rained again today so tennis was out of the question.....Jesus its been more than a week since I've played and I really want to hopefully Thursday.

      The Warped Tour is a go...with a few slight changes, Instead of Mark and I staying with Sean his parents are gonna come to Montreal with us, I guess they couldn't trust Sean around thier son lol. I didn't post yesteray cause I forgot but I'm glad that I'm actually sticking to something. I'm not sure what I'm doing today I haven't gotten ahold of anyone yet so we'll see what happens..but fuck its foggy again!! everyday day this week I can't believe it I hope its sunny everyday next week.

      Well it was a pretty boring day I went to Marks then we went to the fruit stand with Chris after that we went to the mall and then back to the stand and I had some ice cream...After that we went to Marks and we had some Cajun rice stuff that was pretty good but I think that the beams looked like rabbit shit...Oh well its all good. After that we biked to Bunkers Peninsula ....Its not a fucking island..lol. Then I biked home and now here I am I'm gonna go and shower cause I feel gross from biking all day.

      It's Tuesday and I feel like posting......Today Sean called me from Montreal and woke me up at 12:45 which is earlier than I'm used to but I can handle it...I went to Marks again today, he got his iBook today 14 inch its sweet I'll hopefully get one some day soon. Mark said that I can have the Triumph its a beast...lol. Didn't get to board much today because of the weather but hopefully tomorrow. It's looking really good about going to the Warped Tour as long as Marks mom lets him go her friend was telling her some stories about his shady past so she's gonna have to talk to his parents...lol good stuff. I hope to figure out if we are going to the Warped Tour by the end of the week we just need to work out the details now. Well I'm gonna go and get some watermelon.

      As I sit here at 3:54 in the morning drinking Hawaiian Punch I realize it has been awhile since my last post......nearly a month. But not too much has happened I've been listening to ALOT of punk lately and because of it I am becoming very politically educated and I think that its really cool. I also hurt my leg skateboarding like two weeks ago and haven't started skateboarding again until today and I fell a lot...lol but I was so happy to FINALLY get back on that it didn't really matter. I've noticed that skateboarding has toughened me up quite a bit I used to be afraid to fall but now it doesn't bother much at all. I'm pretty sure I'm going to the Warped Tour in Montreal on August 13th it's gonna fucking rock I can't wait to get in the mosh pit and just giver. I got new trucks today for my skateboard and I didn't put riser pads on them at first so if I turned to sharp then my wheels would hit my board and I would hit the ground basically lol. Tomorrow I'm gonna go to Marks early because he's getting his iBook and I'm gonna set it up with him and if it doesn't rain we'll get a good solid day of skating in. Well that's pretty much it...I hope to start posting more soon but I guess we'll see what happens.
