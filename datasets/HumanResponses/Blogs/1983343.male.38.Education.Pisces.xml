         a low  price  product may need frequent service which will increase its effective  cost . a good quality and moderate priced object may have a low  cost  because of reliability. hence we should see the  price  and imagine the  cost .

       internet advertisements can build your brand    advertisements can build your brand, even if a visitor does not click, if he sees the product summary or even the name a few times he may buy that brand, when he goes to the shop, as he would have heard of it. but good advertising for a shoddy product will work in building a long term rejection of that product brand, so if you are still in alpha do not show off. So when you advertise do not look at clicks but unique page views.

       It is important to be honest and adopt fair business practices,  if you cheat you will see success for some time,  but sooner or later that wealth or progress will be eroded.     honesty alone pays, it may pay less, but it will sustain. never encourage the build up of virtual money.    whatever is false will collapse one day. this will cause hardships and pain to everybody. newton's laws govern most everything even finance.

       variations of products    just like in TV or Tape Recorders all products must be in three variants. this applies to software, hardware, services etc.. the most important variant is the low cost durable variant, uses time proven technologies, this is sold in large numbers, it streamlines the manufacturing and other processes, it announces the product-brand-company far and wide. the second variant is priced higher, has more advanced features, uses new technologies, needs more customer support and serves the purpose fully in a cost-effective manner, this is the standard product. The last variant has many bells, whistles and flashers, this is priced very high, personal human customer support will be involved, it has many luxurious features which may be decorative but may serve no useful purpose. it could even be custom altered or designed. it will also serve as a status symbol for some. the idea is all types of customers are served, the company makes decent revenue, and a company can be built and sustained on long term basis.

       phone numbers are getting longer and longer as population grows and users also increase. long numbers cannot be in memory and difficult to key in.    The telephone instrument should have a alphanumeric keyboard and phone numbers should be like  tom.phone   or  chang.phone.china  this is easy to key in and numbers are 10, alphabets are 26 you will get 36 char. per position instead of only 10, infrastructure will be different, but there is no other way.  anyway my phone string is  ananth.delabs.india

        Virus ? : Today I turned on my XP-P4 and then.......   computer came up slowly right clicked taskbar clicked task manage-performance-CPU usage was 100%. no wonder all applications slow or just stopped. now in task manager in processes tab CPU column searched who was it that was 99%. he was KNETOUPSQRVR.exe -right click -end process- then only i could work on comp, then my comp-c:-right click -search-advanced-select system,hidden,sub-folders then put above file name in filename text box and searched, it was in c:\windows,   then cut and pasted him into d:\caught_virus then restarted system ......then one more chap was there. repeated above on him also,  then went to c:\windows caught all fellows of same date and put them away. now computer is ok, all of them have landed 2 days ago, i still do not know if it is virus or a buggy program. i still have not restored registry or restored from norton ghost, because i want to see if he comes back.  i have to understand to tacke them, anyway my antivirus program does stay in the system tray. these virus or buggy programs enable me to learn about windows -xp. i think windows-xp should not allow any process to take over 50% usage. the other day i put an animated gif as tiled wallpaper for desktop and CPU 100% comp just went cold.     these are the chaps caught redhanded sending my cpu to a tizzy   PPJQRO.exe&nbsp;	                73,728 WQXUYPTOQQQOS.exe&nbsp;	73,728 KNETOUPSQRVR.exe&nbsp;	73,728 precontrol.exe	&nbsp;                  2,560 new.exe	    &nbsp;                            73,728 inst.exe	   &nbsp;                           139,264 DNSErr.dll&nbsp;	                94,208     if you the virus maker then why not use the power to be creative and constructive, i am sure you can do it. if this was a buggy program then my apologies, consider this my bug report.

      xml-html FM radio   [b]FM radio enhancements[/b]     FM radios consume less power and are affordable,  now we should add a small LCD display like you have in cellphones.     xml should be frequency modulated and transmitted by FM stations in adjoining bands.     xml is demodulated by fm radio and displayed in the lcd display on radio. this way news can be transmitted to many people without internet or TCP/IP. this is just one way broadcast of xml or html information, it need very less freq.    even html, jpeg, png and flash can be broadcast by FM radio. Product Advertisements can also be sent in this format. just tune into your xml FM radio station with your color LCD portable radio and presto news, ads, pictures, semi static but can reach millions. the radio tuner can Tab over different stations.

      I was testing some software on xp/p4 with winamp playing a mp3 song, then to go online i turned on the dial up networking DUN, as it was dialling the number, the mp3 song slipped on the same line again and again many times just like a gramophone needle slips when the spiral ridge breaks. The problem is multitasking and multithreading will have no meaning till hardware IRQ remains, when I insert a CDROM all other applications stop and resume only after that has settled down. what that means we have to network the hardware devices and not IRQ them, then i do not even understand what i am writing.  The only OS i wrote is for 8051 in which all the devices will just wait for the processor to call on them, the processor would go around and ask each one to give the data if he a sensor or tell him what to do if he was an actuator. but when too many devices exist then we need one processor to attend and service IRQ (interrupt requests i think) and another processor to continue the threads or processes that are alive.

      if you get a text ebook from  urlLink Project Gutenberg  it may be big like 2 mb. then use  urlLink NoteTab Text Editors and HTML Editors  to read it as notepad will not work, you can rename big (500kb and above) text files from 'history.txt' to 'history.btxt' and associate extension '.btxt' in 'NoteTab' options then you can double click to open the big text files in notetab. I liked a text file aesop's fables i got from  urlLink portal5  then i pasted the text to Mozilla composer wysiwyg  urlLink mozilla.org  then colored the text, and all titles were made to 'H1'  and used  urlLink HTMLDOC  to make a pdf ebook which has a contents pane with the list of stories. Get the aesop's fables from my website.

      search within files.  I have a folder with bloggger templates, i edited them, and i used xp search for text string "file://" (as this is my most common error (absolute-relative-urls) when i cut and paste links in wysiwyg and other things.), the search results were none, then just to make sure i put a string i knew was in the file, even that did nor come, this had happened before now it was confirmed that the 'search for text strings in files and folders' does not work properly. then i used  urlLink TextPad   it has a powerful inbuilt grep for entire folders and sub folders, this amazing software was able to do it, this software can also compare text files, good to catch errors when editing existing code. and it has regular expression find-replace.  Then even the xp zip integrated in the os could be buggy, some of my 400Mb zip got corrupt, i use zipgenius now, it is good, i can use it for tar and gz as i need that for lamp.    urlLink ZipGenius 5  freeware zip unzip software. File compression is finally easy and free, with no adware, no spyware, no ads, no money. ZipGenius is free and handles many archive formats.     urlLink TextPad - the text editor for Windows   i used  urlLink urlbase 5.1 introduction  my bookmark manager to make above links, you just right click on a URL and 'copy as HTML' it gives full code to paste, yes i know we can type it but that is prone to error.

       how to cache lamp cms websites.  when you use html pages we have only apache load to consider, but when php and mysql is added for dynamic websites, we have php load which is not much and mysql load which is a bit more. according to reliability theory more parts-components means less reliability, so when mysql fails the whole website is down which is not so good. a html alternative site has to be given when mysql fails so that downtime is reduced. now what i tried is simple and it works for small sites. this can also be used by people to use cms to build the website in their pc and generate html to upload in a html only website. 1. in my windows computer - 'wamp' localhost i have a mirror of my remote 'lamp' website. 2. i used  urlLink wysigot  to download-cache entire cms site in html from localhost. 3. exported the folder that i cached (export only in paid version) and the html version was there. 4. the exported html was just like the original only it is not dynamic, (login- search will not work).   i tested this with mambo open source and pmachine and it works well.   urlLink Lamp, php, mysql, apache, applications, scripts, tested, free.

       AI or artificial intelligence applications could be used to generate the search string to the search engines, this may help simple people get what they want in the internet, without having to rack their grey matter to improve their search results. but the strength of a AI application (like some simple AI spell checks in some software i use) depends on a human built database of knowledge with a capability to learn thru internet or by collaborative computing.  Then i have a small AI - DOS based program made by greg leedberg which works pretty well, it is called daisy, i taught it many things for over a year, now it comes up with shocking things i have never heard about, it may be that a Martian may have got control over it  (Martian :- small life form about the size of a flea that used to inhabit mars, now Martian refugees have landed all over the planet earth and have formed colonies on many dogs and puppies, the exodus from mars started after many space probe Robots from earth landed in the red planet, if your pet dog is behaving in a strange manner contact the space enthusiast close to home and see if you can establish communication with these small people for your future depends on them, these minute purple flea like creatures have some technologies which could help us go beyond puny things like globalization to macro inter galactic expansions)        oh my god i got carried away, i am sorry, getting back to AI here is the link to daisy  urlLink Greg Leedberg , simple, down to earth.

      Money as binary objects.   I feel we should do trade in the internet with binary cash. then it can only be done by technologies and governments.    a binary cash say a 100 note is a encrypted file with serial number. it will have a history of transactions written into it. every transaction will be tracked and validated by government computers. transaction is complete if payee, payer and government approves it    people can carry in USB thumb drives any amount of cash. it can be uploaded or downloaded to effect a transfer with security key.    we can spend according to the cash binary objects we have on CDROM.   (this has worked with martians, it might work with us, who knows?)

      i have a very bad memory and once in a while i play with visual basic, so i found a way to organize my code snips in a tree form with a very fast program called aldensoft's snippet urlLink Aldensoft Software . put your code three deep in this text snips organizer, you can also search, also store all the example vb forms you collected, a simple fast database, this database will not get corrupted as each text snippet is a separate file. and backup every day into another folder using  urlLink Swoosie backup . I do not use source safe etc. what i do?, every project has two sub folders called 'archives'  and 'name_x', and after every stage i zip the 'name_x' folder and put into 'archives' as 'name_1' ,'name_2' etc. end of the day back up all on CDROM-RW floppy and end of week on a CDROM-MS-16X all my webpages and others also backed up like this, a MS multi session CDROM can be used for months as it is incremental burning, a CDROM-RW is only for very short term like USB flash thumb drive.

       valuable webpages lost    many useful websites just disappear overnight, they may have data that is very valuable, some social non-profit organization could mirror the copyleft or open source websites with the webmaster's consent, i mean the pdf, images and html that are free to copy, this with proper screening may be just a few gigabytes of data, but priceless for the world, if such archiving is done and kept available to the world, education will be much more easier and the world will be a better place for all of us.

       website validation   if you have hundreds of pages to manage in a website and pages have many local and remote links then a single modification in one page may cause problems to entire site due to bad links. so the solution is........  a. use a grep like "findstr" in xp or Textpad has a powerful grep to search in folders and sub-folders, windows find phrase in   files is not ok. use grep to search for "file:" for relative URL errors. b. cache the entire website in wysigot once, cache also sites you link just once, check all links, then when you change a page, cache that page again and verify all links in wysigot, lot of bandwidth saved and 100% no broken links. c. use copy and paste for URLs, typing it can be risky, and you will make mistakes if you are in a hurry or too many links. d. have the entire website you are building in one folder called say "mysite", after work is done, rename "mysite" to "xxmysite" and open index.html in opera at 800*600 and test the pages which were changed, this will catch all errors. or best use some CMS like websmill or blog.   urlLink TextPad - the text editor for Windows   urlLink Wysigot - browse, capture and monitor the web   urlLink Opera Internet Browser   urlLink Web development (CMS) software based on XML - XSL - Xtreeme WebsMill   urlLink The Developer's Corner blog

       Thousands of years ago when in the whole world there were only cave men, in china the people were making complex gadgets and inventions. many of which we use today unaware of the chinaman's contribution. the pants and shirts you wear also came from there. there were no patents then, if there was patents then  the world would owe zillions of dollars to china.     very soon china will amaze the world with devices never seen before. they alone have that potential, they were just held back by time. if you are not a friend of china, its not too late, become a friend now. it is Buddha's own country, bow to the great chinaman.

        secret of immortality :: the elixir of life.     those people who think only of themselves. those who work only for personal benefit. those that lead a selfish, greedy or lusty life. these people are mere robots or zombies. they have no soul in them. when they die, nothing remains.     but.....     if you care and love all beings. if you work for the welfare for all mankind. if you put others well being above your own. then you are invested with a soul. Which is immortal. your body may perish, still you will recur over every cycle.      why........    the reason is simple, just like a gardeners plucks the weeds and throws them away. but he tends carefully to the plants bearing flowers and fruits. he even collects the seeds of the useful plants to sow  the next year.    your soul is the seed, it is not matter, it is like the data on a CD-ROM, harddisk or floppy.

       The Ant and the Grasshopper    In a field one summer's day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content. An Ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest. "Why not come and chat with me," said the Grasshopper, "instead of toiling and moiling in that way?" "I am helping to lay up food for the winter," said the Ant, "and recommend you to do the same." "Why bother about winter?" said the Grasshopper; we have got plenty of food at present." But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil. When the winter came the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer. Then the Grasshopper knew:    "It is best to prepare for the days of necessity."    aesop's fables

"I am contented with my lot," said the Reed. "I may not be so grand, but I think I am safer."  "Safe!" sneered the Tree. "Who shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my head to the ground?"   But it soon had to repent of its boasting, for a hurricane arose  which tore it up from its roots, and cast it a useless log on the ground,  while the little Reed, bending to the force of the wind, soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over.

         all things bright and beautiful        by  Cecil Frances Alexander       All things bright and beautiful,  All creatures great and small,  All things wise and wonderful,  The Lord God made them all.   Each little flower that opens,  Each little bird that sings,  He made their glowing colours,  He made their tiny wings.   The rich man in his castle,  The poor man at his gate,  God made them, high or lowly,  And ordered their estate.  The purple-headed mountain,  The river running by,  The sunset, and the morning,  That brightens up the sky.  The cold wind in the winter,  The pleasant summer sun, The ripe fruits in the garden,  He made them every one.   The tall trees in the greenwood,  The meadows where we play,  The rushes by the water,  We gather every day.   He gave us eyes to see them,  And lips that we might tell,  How great is God Almighty,  Who has made all things well

       The mystery of mind body and soul.    now we can understand robotics, computers and internet. so it is much easier to explain the nature of the human being.    analogy between man and computer robot.     body - like - computer box, hardware with sensors and actuators which is gross. mind - like - software, operating system and applications which are subtle. soul - like - data, database, files, registry, documents, spreadsheets you have created.  god - like - server, internet, distributed computing, network, search engine, repository.  the data you generate is mirrored in the repository and when computer goes bad it is reloaded in a new upgraded model, the old hardware can be disposed off, because of wear and tear.  the internet (soulnet) is connected to many comps thru a wireless lan and a bit of tuning you can get connected. some comps are actuators, some sensors and some both.  the hardware can breakdown, the software can be corrupted, but the data is very safe. The aim of each person is to build a nice and clean database of himself with nice attributes.      i know it may be hard to understand, difficult to believe, all that matters is have love for god the rest will happen by itself, the love for god will come by selfless service to all humanity.  for that to happen you have to understand that the entire universe is one organic life form called god. In a human body if the heart fails other organs are affected, so we are interdependent.    all the above are not my ideas, they just happen and i have to write it down, it is what the ancient saints said.

        what is cancer.    suppressed emotions and desires are not good, gratification of every desire is also dangerous.  one has to be content and happy with whatever comes our way.  this can happen only when you believe that god has a plan for one and all, an obstacle in a persons desire or goal can lead to cancer if the mindset is wrong.  cancer is the rebellion of the cells,  the expression of the state of the mind, the objective in life is not money, assets, fame or power but knowledge and evolution of the soul to higher planes.    but even the most noble and divine souls have been unable to manage this, and even they do get cancer.         so also ...........  kidney problems - due to wrong type of food - eat simple natural food. heart problems - overeating drinking and less physical activity - eat less be more active. aids etc. -  immoral behaviour - be committed to the institution of marriage. plague etc. - lack of sanitation - good water and sewage system.  if you try to bypass these problems with tricks new problems will come. try to eradicate the cause of these problems so that they never grow to that stage when they become incurable.

       what is good ? what is bad ? who the hero ? who plays villain? everything is relative, good for one is bad for another.   sometimes the lord uses the good to get his work done. sometimes he uses the bad to get his work done.   all are puppets in the hands of his angels. Only the true devotee of the lord is free. they hang carrots before greedy and power hungry people only to execute his will.   when man believes in 'each one for himself' and hurts others, what else can the angels do. if all would learn to share and care, then all would eat and sleep in peace. then there would be no chaos, no war, no earthquakes and no disease. even if a few understand this the world will become a better place.

       The Goose With the Golden Eggs   One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering. When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him. But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.

        gold is a relative standard for the economy of a country. the true standard for economy is the productivity. gold is good for plating and for thin wires in electronics. it is very rare and a symbol of wealth and power. diamond is dense carbon sparkles and very hard. it is great as a cutting tool for engineering. take great care about these two. it can hurt you sometimes.

        pride is due to ignorance and absence of true knowledge. true knowledge is to know that " god  is everything".    when you are proud of caste, race, wealth, youth, power or fame. you are under the spell of an illusion which is bad for you.    what is that which matters? what is the substance? it is your deeds, your attributes, your love for god.  there is nothing to say beyond this, and many will not understand. truth is strewn on the floor, but only few will imbibe the facts.

      insecticides and pesticides are not very safe to use within the home or garden. these affect the respiratory system of humans and will affect animals too. it also hurts some harmless insects and animals which are needed for ecological balance. they also contaminate the drinking water systems and weaken human immune system.   avoid pests and insects by keeping place clean, these are nature's cleaning agents. without  these insects and pests mankind would have perished long ago.    meddling with DNA and RNA, cloning will lead to dreadful mutants and diseases. farming with natural means will give healthy and nutritious vegetable fruits or animals. many of the food items we get have insecticides and pesticides which is very bad. use natural ways to control pests and insects, by preventive measures not by killing.

       the environment has to be saved. this is more important than industrial progress. even economic development is not important before this.    where are we going to live if we make the planet barren. the rains will stop, the rivers and lakes will dry up.  the summers will be harsh, the winter unbearable. the oil will be gone, you cannot use your vehicle.  electricity will go, no way to run your gadgets. food cannot be produced, diseases will be rampant.    be very frugal in the usage of fuel, electricity and paper. being frugal is not for your savings but for the environment. plant more trees, restore lakes, rivers and streams. big trees will enable precipitation, better rainfall.    if we do not take some action ourselves, nature will cause correction. the way nature corrects may be very painful for all of us.

       urlLink GNU Operating System - Free Software Foundation (FSF)  GNU Operating System - Free Software Foundation Free as in Freedom Welcome to the GNU Project web server, www.gnu.org. The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete UNIX style operating system which is free software: the GNU system. (GNU is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not UNIX”; it is pronounced “guh-noo.”) Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as “Linux,” they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.  This is also the web site of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). FSF is the principal organizational sponsor of the GNU Project. FSF receives very little funding from corporations or grant-making foundations. We rely on support from individuals like you who support FSF's mission to preserve, protect and promote the freedom to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer software, and to defend the rights of Free Software users. Last year, over 67% of our operating funds came from individual donors. That ongoing support is the primary way we can continue our work. Please consider making a donation today, becoming an Associate Member of FSF, ordering a copy of Free Software, Free Society, and/or encouraging your company to become a Corporate Patron of FSF.
