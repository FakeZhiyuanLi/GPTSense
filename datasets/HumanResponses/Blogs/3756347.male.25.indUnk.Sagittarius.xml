                 My life has been an amazing journey,rather a roller coaster ride.The Best life has to offer.25 years.....OH MY GOD.......25 years thats what it's been full of FUN FUN FUN....My childhood has been so awesome that i have so many memories.I grew up in a joint family which is till date very loving and caring.Eveyone gets along so well that there are hardly any disputes.Yeah i know you would think it's a perfect family....trust me it is.I have the Best Grandma,Parents,Brothers,Sisters,Uncles,Aunts.Ok now as said my family is too big for a person brought up in a nuclear family to handle(no offence meant for ppl living in nuclear families).Just that i am very lucky.I have only one real brother,no sister.My brother who's married this very lovely woman who has given me the gift in the form of my nephew Aaryan.The sexiest kid alive on this planet.We are gujarati's and my sister-in-law(BHABHIJI with love and respect)is a christian who is the best thing to have happened to our family.She's always smiling(can never forget that smile).            Well again i wandered off..Getting back to my life.My teen life was also awesome.Much different than my childhood.In the sense that i moved into a wider world,where i met numerous people and all different kinds.Took me a while to get adjusted to the world outside my family circle.I made lots of new friends,most of them later on moved out to some other groups.In junior college i was this very straight and simple kid who was not very much aware of the corrupt world outside.By the time i got into my degree college i was an enlightened being.All that i know about in life and the things i believe in today are due to what i've learnt in college.I had very few friends in college who stayed with me even after.We all were very alike.After getting my graduates degree i was searching for a job and had almost got thru to CITIBANK.That was the time my Best Buddy called me to join him at work and i said yes.Work here has been so much fun and i've learnt a gr8 deal.My friend believes and trusts me a lot and i intend to keep it going forever.Last year at around this time my life changed a full 360 degrees when i met this amazing woman who within a few meetings made me sure that she's the one,and i thank god that he gave me the vision to take the right decision at the right time.Now she's in my life and LIFE as i said is like a bed of roses.She always tell me that she loves me more than i love her but one fine day she'll realise that i love her,if not more than her than atleast as much as she does.more about her and all others in detail later when i blog about all the important people in my life individually.In short SHE'S the Best.Right now life is looking good as my love life,my work life and my family life is in perfect harmony and looking to progress even further.It's about 21:30 right now and am still at office.Just stayed back to get my dad's work done and Mainly to blog.This is fun,i think i can do this more often and am loving it.So after reading this blog if you feel that your life is better than mine then please comment on my blog and gimme that details of your life.I'm sure mine will score a point over yours. wink wink. Love all and spread peace not terror.Love all kinds be it man or animal.LOVE is the Keyword.

Well i work in a diamond manufacturing unit(WOW, I KNOW) where i am looking after the total administration in the office as well as am actively involved in the planning and decision making.Most people are either impressed by the word Diamond or think that it's too boring.Well if you actually spend a day with me in office you'll realise what i meant before.Ok now i know by now you are bored and don't wanna go further.Well i think my first blog went pretty good considering just a few mins back i didn't know what to blog about......I'll end my blog here and bid  ADIEU.So long until next time...  P.S: Feel free to comment on my blog and am sorry if my english is not up to the mark as i have read a few blogs and people can really write.

      It’s still not raining in mumbai as expected. Seems like another year with water cuts….I sure hope that it rains soon enough so that we can again waste water like we do every year. I was really busy the last whole fortnight and was not able to logon. Well I’m back today and have some spare time to write. Have several thoughts and ideas to write about but too tired to pick one….that’s me lazy as always. I really wanna start writing about all the events of my life( That would take a zillion years). I think I’ll blog today about one person atleast so that the chain starts….....Here we go...........

      Hey people finally it’s fixed…..the day we get married.The auspicious day is 26th December 2004. It sure feels great and am very anxious now. Got lots of work to do for the wedding to go good. Have to book a hall,caterer,shopping for clothes and accessories.Today the day went by thinking how everything is going to work out. It is pretty stressful and consumes a hell lot of energy. Now it seems like 6 months is just around the corner. The day after Christmas. Yesterday our parents met and talked for quite some time. They jumped from one topic to another. At one point of time I thought that the main topic of discussion has been sidelined and it’s as if they have met moreover on a casual basis. Well but at the same time it seemed that they were pretty comfortable by themselves. Yesterday I left early from office so that I could make it there before time so as not to miss out on anything important. You see I do have a habit of reaching late at important functions. When I reached there I saw her dad sitting and watching television,he noticed me and welcomed me inside. By now she knew that I had arrived and she came out of her room in her favourite yellow pyjama’s and the OM kurta with the handsfree hanging from the phone. She gave me a big broad smile and offered me water( 2 glasses as I am always very thirsty). We then sat down with her dad and spoke for a while about which dates would be convenient for my brother to attend the wedding. Then we watched television for a while till the time she and her mom prepared food. In the meanwhile her brother came back from work and was in his room for a while so that he could freshen up. Then dinner was served,she sat right next to me and had her dinner. She was cracking jokes on me and her mother and having a gala time. She was looking absolutely stunning( SNOW WHITE  is the right word). Then after dinner we waited for my parents to arrive. They did in about 15-20 mins time and we all sat down to talk. She touched my dad’s feet for his blessing’s (which she always does and my dad runs away as he feel’s I guess a little shy or maybe embarrassed- But I’m totally proud of her for that ). They both eventually have a laugh at it afterwards.We all spoke for about 1 hr . In between that her brother asked her and me if 26th was alright with us and I immediately replied that any auspicious day is fine for us, and she smile from one ear to the other. I noticed that she took every opportunity to look at me and smile.Then came the time to say goodbye for the day and we walked out of the house. She and her mom accompanied us till the end of the lane. My car was parked in th opposite lane and I forgot to go and get the car till the time Elders spoke.Then she reminded me to get the car and I left for it. Didn’t know she was right behind me and calling me as at that time I was calling up my Best Buddy TEJAS. Apparently he had gone out with my one time friend Amish and his friends. But he was glad to hear about the dates and congratulated me. It felt good. Then next thing she did was call up her best friend and let him know of the dates. She also felt elated. Then we sat in the car and left to pick up mom and dad. To our surprise parents were still having a chat,so we sat in the car and had our chat. She asked me if I could take her out tomorrow to a place  called DANA PANI. Well I didn’t know if I would have the car to go there as the place is pretty scary. There are lotsa drunk men there.they come there to enjoy the beach,it’s just that I don’t find it secure enough.Well I drifted away from the topic again. We then said bye to one another and headed home.So that was the day yesterday,definitely an awesome one.More to blog later.
