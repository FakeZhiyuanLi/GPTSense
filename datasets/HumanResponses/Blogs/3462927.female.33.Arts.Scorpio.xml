      Reading through this c-razy midwesterner (oxymoron? methinks yes.)  urlLink Kevin's blog  (Thanks Kev!) I found a bunch of great Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handy ('member those?):  Here's a few good ones for you old farts:  That crow seems to be calling my name, thought Caw.   (y'all know I got a Crow thing)  ***  When I die, i hope they say of me, Damn (s)he owed me a lot of money.  ***  If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away.  ***  I told my nephew I would take him to Disneyland. We got in my car and I took him to a burned out warehouse. "Oh no!" I said, "Disneyland burned down!" He cried and cried, but deep down I think he thought it was a pretty good joke.  ***  I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy---something like that.  ***  If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look. He's carrying a soldering iron!" and started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, "That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free drink.   ***  Isn't it sad to think that families can be ripped apart by something as simple as wild dogs?   ***  If trees could scream, would be be so cavelier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, and for no good reason.  ***  If you ever fall off the sears tower go real limp, like a dummy and someone with catch you because, hey, free dummy!    ***  Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someone's neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing?!"   ***  To me, it's always a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a hand?" you can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."   WANT MORE? Blow through this link!       urlLink ">Link     (you greedy americanus)

      1,000 pages of cat litter.  it's grey. it's a GREAT pee catcher. it keeps the windows clean so i can stay vigilant in my Hawk-watch (Eeeeat the birds ... tuppins a head ... tuppins ... tuppins ... tuppins ... a head!).  Also ... she tends to ignore my pleas for lap-time when she's reading.   Finally, if she's really really busy, I can sneak food off of her plate.  *****  Now, speaking of food, who does a cat have to lick to get them to put Haagen Daz on the f'in Atkins Diet? It's my FAVORITE!

       urlLink    Bumpin in on Sheeba�s space (cuz she�s chillin at the window winding up her aim for tonight)  So much to write about, right? How about a doggy-style black girl with a big question: What's Behind Her? (hmmm... gee ... )  http://www.boomspeed.com/ljfade/3.jpg  Uh ... wow ...  THE EDITORS! THE EDITORS! Are ad dollars so few and far between?  1) First of all ... there's that ... then the whole "what's behind brandy" ... well ... VIBE seems to be fuckin' her pretty royally from behind (see mast)  2) The horror is that the ladies at the office seem completely unoffended...  3) I shoulda NEVER gone to college ... this whole "critical thought" thing'll be the death of me one day soon I tellyawhat.   4) I mean, let�s flow for a minute: Caption a) malegazeatwoman (skeetskeetskeet=sexy (perfect segue into �hip hop meets porn� I suppose); Caption b) malegazewishfullyatself (raw&uncut--clearly phallic + HIPHOP meets porn); Cap c) WHAT'S BEHIND BRANDY? (is that an invitation?); Cap d) mobb deep -- recalling the male-gaze-lesbian-fantasy; Cap e) heads up (do i really need to comment? i think not ... but they threw in �groupie� in case you missed the head ref); Cap f) a list of a buncha overtly macho references and a white girl sandwiched inside -- like uh -- can we attempt to enflame the whole black-male-assumed-direct-route-to-testosterone thing a teensy bit more?  Now, I need to say a few things:  A -- It is DAMN HARD (no testes-laden-pun-intended) to offend me (I tend to have a rather offensive sense of humor myself).  B - I�m not even sure I�m offended, just �troubled� ... perhaps it�s the continual crossing of lines these days ... who knows.   C -- One of the many reasons for that may very well be because my brain needs something non-Iraq-related to be troubled about (whew, what a break! Skeet on my brothas!).  D -- Another of the things that�s also got me most is that the basic response from the ladies in the officina is �She looks pretty� (with due flack to whoever needed to tighten her weave) -- dang.   D -- My American-ADD-addled brain may forget this whole thing as soon as I post it (what -- American Idol? (really, just kiddin)) But I look forward to your thoughtful thoughts world. (Sheeba�s due later).     Skeet On!  (p.s. rave on FANGS!)

      Mama This Week:  SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): The Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai wrote that "The soul is a search; the soul is a dance of searches for whatever is lost." Let that be your guiding thought in the coming weeks, Scorpio. The astrological omens suggest that it's high time for you to go looking for a missing treasure. The best way to ensure that you find it is to feed and praise and give free rein to the part of you that you call your soul.   Yeah. High time indeed. Samiya here ... Sheeba's off puking somewhere (she didn't tell you she was a TOTAL bulemic, did she. mmph.) So I'm definitely in search of ... not this year, I don't know if I want to say all that right now, but perhaps it's true. Searching. So, perhaps this week I'll do some feeding of my soul.   If anyone out there (you know how you are ... freaks...) has got something to feed my soul, hook a sista up!   Went to the LIberty game tonight. Ironically enough (if ya know me) we played Detroit. Spanked 'em actually. Okay, that's not true. Barely made away w/ our hats, but made away we did.  The girl in front of my seat is a young whipper snapper name of "Maddie" ... like the Liberty mascot dog. Kinda cute really. She needs a $75 shirt.  John McCain is currently kinda reminding me of my Uncle Ken.  Go ahead ... tell him that. I think it was a compliment. Well, really just a statement of fact. I tend to give compliments face to face. I suppose it was the serious earnestness mixed with that goofy sense of humor we all love. The Daily Show (again) ... repeat (see previous post of Sheeba's)  QUESTION -- WHAT IS "NATURAL MALE ENHANCEMENT"? I mean ... really. All they sell on the tube these days is sex and drugs. And then they blame us for partaking. Nutso if you ask me.  So anyway ... just a note to self: I've notably recommited to a certain search today. Thanks, Rob, for the reminder :-)  I'll put another dime in that tip jar!  Hey, if you wanna join me world, do so here (you get a "personal" thank you!):  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr  and if, after reading about my own certain enlightment, you wanna check for yours, click me baby!  www.realastrology.com

      oh, wait. if that's your situation then rest assured: you did it already.  nah, i'm kiddin. but i gotta say, if you haven't read Susan Sontag's piece in last weeks' NYTimes Magazine ... yr missin some pretty purrrr-licious commentary.  if you missed it, check it out:  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/magazine/23PRISONS.html  Speaking of "if you missed it" ... whatever happened to THE DAILY SHOW? what's up with the week's worth of re-runs.  Let me tell you the deal: samiya comes home from whatever the hell she does all day. i bug her while she pees. i bug her while she takes off her "street drag". I bug her until she feeds me. then i bug her to sit on her lap 68 times until she finally screams at me to stay on the floor -- or gives in. How you like them odds? Me, I can live with 'em.  but ... then what generally happens is, she does whatever she wants so LONG as she turns on The Daily Show (comedy central -- best news ever -- haha) while she does it.  I'm happy. She's happy. The freaks at Comedy Central are happy. One more reminder to pay the cable bill. But now ... I've seen them all before.  I did see this ... crazy Jon Stewart's commencement speech (it's the grand year of the commencement speech, so long as you're not the president's kids I suppose):  Jon Stewart's ('84) Commencement Address  Thank you Mr. President, I had forgotten how crushingly dull these ceremonies are. Thank you.  My best to the choir. I have to say, that song never grows old for me. Whenever I hear that song, it reminds me of nothing.  I am honored to be here, I do have a confession to make before we get going that I should explain very quickly. When I am not on television, this is actually how I dress. I apologize, but theres something very freeing about it. I congratulate the students for being able to walk even a half a mile in this non-breathable fabric in the Williamsburg heat. I am sure the environment that now exists under your robes, are the same conditions that primordial life began on this earth.  I know there were some parents that were concerned about my speech here tonight, and I want to assure you that you will not hear any language that is not common at, say, a dock workers union meeting, or Tourretts convention, or profanity seminar. Rest assured.  I am honored to be here and to receive this honorary doctorate. When I think back to the people that have been in this position before me from Benjamin Franklin to Queen Noor of Jordan, I cant help but wonder what has happened to this place. Seriously, it saddens me. As a person, I am honored to get it; as an alumnus, I have to say I believe we can do better. And I believe we should. But it has always been a dream of mine to receive a doctorate and to know that today, without putting in any effort, I will. Its incredibly gratifying. Thank you. Thats very nice of you, I appreciate it.  Im sure my fellow doctoral graduateswho have spent so long toiling in academia, sinking into debt, sacrificing God knows how many years of what, in truth, is a piece of parchment that in truth has been so devalued by our instant gratification culture as to have been rendered meaninglesswill join in congratulating me. Thank you.  But today isnt about how my presence here devalues this fine institution. It is about you, the graduates. Im honored to be here to congratulate you today. Today is the day you enter into the real world, and I should give you a few pointers on what it is. Its actually not that different from the environment here. The biggest difference is you will now be paying for things, and the real world is not surrounded by three-foot brick wall. And the real world is not a restoration. If you see people in the real world making bricks out of straw and water, those people are not colonial re-enactorsthey are poor. Help them. And in the real world, there is not as much candle lighting. I dont really know what it is about this campus and candle lighting, but I wish it would stop. We only have so much wax, people.  Lets talk about the real world for a moment. We had been discussing it earlier, and II wanted to bring this up to you earlier about the real world, and this is I guess as good a time as any. I dont really know to put this, so Ill be blunt. We broke it.  Please dont be mad. I know we were supposed to bequeath to the next generation a world better than the one we were handed. So, sorry.  I dont know if youve been following the news lately, but it just kinda got away from us. Somewhere between the gold rush of easy internet profits and an arrogant sense of endless empire, we heard kind of a pinging noise, and uh, then the damn thing just died on us. So I apologize.  But heres the good news. You fix this thing, youre the next greatest generation, people. You do thisand I believe you canyou win this war on terror, and Tom Brokaws kissing your ass from here to Tikrit, let me tell ya. And even if you dont, youre not gonna have much trouble surpassing my generation. If you end up getting your picture taken next to a naked guy pile of enemy prisoners and dont give the thumbs up youve outdid us.  We declared war on terror. We declared war on terrorits not even a noun, so, good luck. After we defeat it, Im sure well take on that bastard ennui.  But obviously thats the world. What about your lives? What piece of wisdom can I impart to you about my journey that will somehow ease your transition from college back to your parents' basement?  I know some of you are nostalgic today and filled with excitement and perhaps uncertainty at what the future holds. I know six of you are trying to figure out how to make a bong out of your caps. I believe you are members of Psi U. Hey that did work, thank you for the reference.  So I thought Id talk a little bit about my experience here at William and Mary. It was very long ago, and if you had been to William and Mary while I was here and found out that I would be the commencement speaker 20 years later, you would be somewhat surprised, and probably somewhat angry. I came to William and Mary because as a Jewish person I wanted to explore the rich tapestry of Judaica that is Southern Virginia. Imagine my surprise when I realized The Tribe was not what I thought it meant.  In 1980 I was 17 years old. When I moved to Williamsburg, my hall was in the basement of Yates, which combined the cheerfulness of a bomb shelter with the prison-like comfort of the group shower. As a freshman I was quite a catch. Less than five feet tall, yet my head is the same size it is now. Didnt even really look like a head, it looked more like a container for a head. I looked like a Peanuts character. Peanuts characters had terrible acne. But what I lacked in looks I made up for with a repugnant personality.  In 1981 I lost my virginity, only to gain it back again on appeal in 1983. You could say that my one saving grace was academics where I excelled, but I did not.  And yet now I live in the rarified air of celebrity, of mega stardom. My life a series of Hollywood orgies and Kabala center brunches with the cast of Friends. At least thats what my handlers tell me. Im actually too valuable to live my own life and spend most of my days in a vegetable crisper to remain fake news anchor fresh.  So I know that the decisions that I made after college worked out. But at the time I didnt know that they would. See college is not necessarily predictive of your future success. And its the kind of thing where the path that I chose obviously wouldnt work for you. For one, youre not very funny.  So how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire? And the honest answer is this. You wont. And accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience.  I was not exceptional here, and am not now. I was mediocre here. And Im not saying aim low. Not everybody can wander around in an alcoholic haze and then at 40 just, you know, decide to be president. Youve got to really work hard to try toI was actually referring to my father.  When I left William and Mary I was shell-shocked. Because when youre in college its very clear what you have to do to succeed. And I imagine here everybody knows exactly the number of credits they needed to graduate, where they had to buckle down, which introductory psychology class would pad out the schedule. You knew what you had to do to get to this college and to graduate from it. But the unfortunate, yet truly exciting thing about your life, is that there is no core curriculum. The entire place is an elective. The paths are infinite and the results uncertain. And it can be maddening to those that go here, especially here, because your strength has always been achievement. So if theres any real advice I can give you its this.  College is something you complete. Life is something you experience. So dont worry about your grade, or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, and you will find it, and people will no longer be grading you, but it will come from your own internal sense of decency which I imagine, after going through the program here, is quite strongalthough Im sure downloading illegal filesbut, nah, thats a different story.  Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in this day and age. And let the chips fall where they may.  And the last thing I want to address is the idea that somehow this new generation is not as prepared for the sacrifice and the tenacity that will be needed in the difficult times ahead. I have not found this generation to be cynical or apathetic or selfish. They are as strong and as decent as any people that I have met. And I will say this, on my way down here I stopped at Bethesda Naval, and when you talk to the young kids that are there that have just been back from Iraq and Afghanistan, you dont have the worry about the future that you hear from so many that are not a part of this generation but judging it from above.  And the other thing.that I will say is, when I spoke earlier about the world being broke, I was somewhat being facetious, because every generation has their challenge. And things change rapidly, and life gets better in an instant.  I was in New York on 9-11 when the towers came down. I lived 14 blocks from the twin towers. And when they came down, I thought that the world had ended. And I remember walking around in a daze for weeks. And Mayor Giuliani had said to the city, Youve got to get back to normal. Weve got to show that things can change and get back to what they were.  And one day I was coming out of my building, and on my stoop, was a man who was crouched over, and he appeared to be in deep thought. And as I got closer to him I realized, he was playing with himself. And thats when I thought, You know what, were gonna be OK.  Thank you. Congratulations. I honor you. Good Night.   http://web.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=3650  So, hey, listen. This lady wants a bike. She's cheap though and doesn't wanna pay more than $200 for it.

      Ah ... and now I get to one of my favorite little bits of:  (drumroll please)    FUN IRAQ TRAGICOMEDY!   (insert high-pitched, giggly laugh track here)    urlLink We've run out of bullets.   Here's a quote: "Winning a war without bullets is like trying to educate kids without any books. Oh, right, I guess we're doing that too."  Okay ... no first of all, neither I (nor my Feeder, I must say) endorse anyone that we don't go "WE ENDORSE THIS MADNESS" to.   But really ... these freakin' Hawks (pause for licking of drool from mouth-fur) go to all kinds of trouble, waste billions of dollars, bomb the hell out of entire families, wedding parties, villages, ensure that -- oh -- thousands of years worth of priceless artwork and and cultural artifacts are destroyed and/or lost for centuries, send in scads of untrained, improperly armed, unprotected, unshielded weekend warriors to do the job of, well, full time ones ...  AND NO ONE TAKES A MINUTE TO STOCK UP ON THE AMMUNITION?   Come on folks. The original GW rowin' up the Delaware had better forethought then that ... and he had to measure powder from a leather bag for every shot he wanted to take!  This is where the insane meets the ridiculous people.  This is where cats and dogs have to take paws (pause? i can never spell that one) and say: hmm ... what's the point of the chase again? Can't we all get along? If we can't ...  can I at least get some freakin' bullets for the battle?!   Even Jon Bon Jovi (and yes, later on I'll allow Feeder to bore the hell out of you w/ her story of how she was forced, in her formative teenage years, to spend the night outside of the Michigan Union so that underage baby sister could get tickets. Oh, the shame to her high school rep. -- a story i've long grown bored of) had the sense to cut hair and act when the time came.  Got gun? GET A FREAKIN BULLET! The Hawks who have the nerve to spend entire lifetimes planning wars should take this one little hint from HAWKERY FOR DUMMIES: if you plan on hittin' it ... you'd better come packin' (generously reprinted in "So You Wanna Be A Dyke Top?"

       urlLink Turning the Tide: Humanitarian Interventions?   Check out Noam Chomsky's li'l ol' blog ... he has a bit on Somali / Rwanda talktalk on there which is worth a quick read. There's much more in there.   He's so serious ... does he never take a moment to just give the Grey Lady a good ol' piss on? I say he should.  However, serious or not, he can be pretty on point.   Any hey, in deference to The Feeder, anyone who even so much as MENTION'S Somalia (and the ridiculous Operation Restore Hope ... haha! That's like the renaming of Abu Ghraib "Camp Redemption"!

      American Liberalism's Achilles Heel   urlLink American Liberalism's Achilles Heel   Okay, so while my Feeder is putting in 30 million hour shifts at the so-called "office" (read: Abu Times Square), I'm just going to go ahead and log on here from the window sill and break a few things down (with all due thanks and pointy-eared head nods to her (p.s. where's my Friskies?!).  So, she had a lovely weekend (so I observed from afar) hanging w/ the various and sundry lovely doyennes of Aztlan.   First: The North.  A&C came through for a little vacationary trip. She got to hang w/ A & C & L a few times having a lovely dinner, checking out this fantasmagoric Philipino joint in SoHo (go figure). It's right next to the new Toys in Babeland, so if the food don't getcha, the "pinwheel" (figure it out and get one) will.  She sometimes neglects to tell me the names of things in her sleep (that's where the best chisme comes from) so you know ... check back.  Hung out in the park on Saturday -- gorgeous -- walked a million blocks through the park, from west side to east side (hail to the Met!) and back. Tried to buy a bike. Failed. Giving big-ups to the neighborhood willie who just may come through with a hookup.  Next: The South.  Sunday, had another hang out in the park day. Full of lovely ladies (Viva la freakin' Raza homes!) and sunshine sunshine. A (a new A), J's friend from L.A. (J has all the best LA friends, in case you were wondering) and she's (a) FINE, (b) sweet as hell, (c) cool and dope and interesting. So they did the whole hang out in the sun thing, then split out to the BK for a fiesta they were too tired & lame to enjoy for long.  Finally, Headed Back Up North like Jim Crow:  Monday, once she realized she'd completely forgotten most of her Spanglish (KWKW-La Mexicana ... donde estan?) she went back to work. Been there ever since.  Actually bucked out for a few ours w/ the Northern Cali ladies ... hung out w/ various & sundry literary folk and had various and sundry literary conversations. However, was a bit ill and couldn't enjoy as much as she wanted. Came home all cranky and pissed at about 3am (after going back to the office like a f'in drone).  For those who haven't heard the ridiculous dramas of the Barbara Boxer / Dianne Feinstein ritual backstabbing of the California electorate ... do a bit of research. Anecdotal evidence makes me cry for my home-cats.  SPECIAL NOTE TO BACK-SLIDING, PSEUDO-LIBERALS: If you're a self-proclaimed, leftist, democrat, black/women/gay-vote-bating, woman running for office in an imaginarily democratic state (medical marijuana meets arnold schwartzenegger, nee reagan ... all in one spot? nuffsaid) ... COME CORRECT! This is the shit that had me clutching at the bars of my pound/prison/guantanemo-mesh walls screeching to aunti-mina: GET ME OUTTA THIS PLACE! (I had yet to me Old Man Winter. harumph.)  So, today. I got to watch the thuderstorms. That actually kinda rocked. They were banging up the sky like my Detroit Home Slices the White Stripes! Like a Seven Nation Army (everyone on the damn UN team except for the U.S. of course -- cuz they like to go it alone) to hold back the rain! Rain on storm clouds!  SPECIAL NOTE TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE JAZZ ON THE PARK HOSTEL:  SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!  AT 3 IN THE MORNING, EVEN  *I* , laissez faire tabby extraordinaire am ready for some f'in sleep!  Now, today, despite the construction on Janet's new spot across the way, I enjoyed thunderstorm watching, Ellen re-run viewing, 360 (hey AC/JR/kathleen & tommy!) viewing -- do vote on their polls, I watch. I want you all to agree w/ me -- www.cnn.com/360.  Now ... The Feeder left me this morning w/ her standard so-long "Goodbye Sheeba! Have a great day! I'll be home this evening!" She says this every day upon leaving the house ... like some sort of Bahston Red Sox twitcher. Like if she didn't say it she wouldn't come back. I ain't complainin' though. Once she's gone I fire up the Powerbook and get my fill of the news of the day.    SPECIAL NOTE TO FOFIE: I GOT THOSE FREE TIX TO THE CHAD VS. URUGUAY SOCCER MATCH YOU ASKED FOR!   Some woman (DC ... tsk tsk tsk. The Feeder, while having no love for the District, attempts a fair amount of compassion for those who (For some reason) choose to live there. I have no such loyalties. All those bitches can kiss my furry striped ass. I hate that "town" and all it represents. I hated every minute I lived there. Just thinking about it makes me wanna go piss on her chair or something. So ... Some woman had the nerve to sound surprised at my "acerbic wit" ... like, cat's can't be witty. AND THIS WOMAN'S MET ME! Trippin. I piss on you and your limited understanding of the true gravitas of the feline class. I bite your ankle. I leave you to your lame non-ascerbic cats. This is exactly why civil rights have yet to arrive ... let women be women, let blacks be people, let dykes get a fuckin sex scene ... let cat's be their witty ascerbic selves ... (this blog has been temporarily interrupted for the following public service announcement: the views in this blog are solely Sheeba's and do not represent the feeder.)   Now, where was I?  Ah, yes. The news of the day.   Didja hear that KERRY is pulling "let america be america again" as a possible new campaign slogan? Check out my fave old gray broad's side on it:       urlLink ">Link     I say yes ... let the bitches revel in poetry again! Langston rules, and poetry keeps me in Fancy Feast and scented litter ... so I ain't hatin.  I actually spent a week-day w/ no Air America. I'm feeling MUSICOLOGY. Prince rocks. Don't let the haters hype you away from the truth.   Of course, I like Guns-n-Roses. So go figure. I'm a f'in bloggin, cursin, spitting out the window screen tabby cat. I can be eccentric.  I also liked the piece about Grey's plays. (look it up you lazy fucks)  Now ... I'm out for now. Maybe I'll share some words of not-so-wisdom later.   Right now, I see a piece of very important paper I have yet to chew up. I'm off the sill.  --Sheeb  (CHECK BACK SOON! and if you punks don't comment soon ... i tell ya what ...)

Kinda funny ... the oh, how we love him, oh how we're like him, oh how he was such a good guy that Gipper! (see the pinching cheeks) is falling right into place.   The good news: Kerry's poll points keep climbing. I honestly believe that MOST of the country (despite wherever the camera's are rolling) was sick of this story by Sunday. The Dubya's vote-for-me! site has been taken over by Reagan-ass-kissing. He seems even more gleefully ignorant of Nancy's straight-up-dis of him then he is of the 'we-love-torture' memo's Ass-crack is trying to hide from Congress.

      (title stolen from Steven Colbert, The Daily Show)   So, as a 10-year-old tabby cat, I wasn't even born when Reagan was in office. You'd think that would keep me safe and sound. But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I spent my first, formative weeks in The Pound. So listen ... I know all about livin' la vida welfare. Reagan? His dirty, bloody hands were all over my cage. Yes, even then. (No, he never remembered it.)   One who does not take alzheimer's lightly (family troubles ... personal issues ... the ol' Feeder's greatest fear lies somewhere scripted in the movie IRIS) ...  I do tend to think that people's evil karma takes many forms. Reagan's ... well, he had his. Reagan's family? Doesn't the family always suffer the sins of the father? It's all a bit too typical to even comment upon.   However ... I'll attach the appropriate links as my own protest to: THE WEEK OF SUCKING REAGAN'S DEAD WHITE DICK ... (insert echo chamber sound f/x).   From what I hear ... everyone from Nicaragua to Botha's South Africa has a little ditty to add to that song. Here's The Feeder's during-his-lifetime input from the visage of 1980's Detroit Rock (i.e., Motor) City (with nods to the following: Michael Moore for keeping it real from Flint, Darlene @ NBC for bringing the cool cat crispies):     A THURSDAY NIGHT HAUNTING OF RONALD REAGAN’S DREAMS    Listen:   all i’ve ever known how to do is build things. spent the last 20 years of my life making cars for a living. spent the last 20 years of my life buying bread the day after it wuz baked, buying water which ran free in the river not far from home, buying cars i built with my own two hands yet still could never afford. i sang that song, dreamt that lie, awoke to the whistle of the coffee brake bell.   my sweat becomes oil. my pistons take your families wherever you want to go—at least i remember when they did. i wuz born in this town now heavy with the ghosts of all our children who could not afford to stay. i wuz never bookish though, content to fix bikes and brake pads, to see my creations go. but my greatest creation also went.   my daughter was bookish enough for the both of us. yet, after 18 years of sweat, i still couldn’t afford to send her to school. it got so i had even to beg for bread—things weren’t supposed to be like this. whole cities built by people creating life washed away by the swath of a pen. so much mightier was the profit than our souls. spirits wasted, frozen cold on the old northern streets where once we bled for what you hastily bought and sold. we believed in our work, our livelihoods, never once thought what we were building could be so disposable.   and we will chase you. I will. chase you into sepulcher nightmares. we won’t let you awaken. and we will make you sit quietly, listen to our stories without interruption, watch exhaustive, poorly edited trailers depicting beautiful children destroyed, pictures of devastation all over the nation you sought to rule. there will be no toll free number, no address where you might send a check.    I’ll begin when the moon is high, work my way into high noon, capture you slowly. you will give us our nuremberg. quite soon you too will wish you could die. We are merciful. We love our children. We will make you sit quietly, listen to our stories without interrupting. We will allow you to keep your wife’s concerned smile close at hand. We will not allow you to reach it. Sit quietly.   Listen.

However, that humanism -- the love, the giving, the togetherness, the prayer -- seems (and, check out the Reagan-deification to understand the whole Things-Are-Not-Always-What-They-Seem -- DAMN. I WAS GOING TO SEE HOW LONG I COULD GO W/O MENTIONING REAGAN. I guess I picked the wrong week to keep listening to even minor media.) overwhelmed by fundamentalism.  Ah ... check it out folks.   Me?

He's screaming his catchphrase (Fuck Bush! Fuck Bush!) and passing out leaflets with the above statement emblazoned on the front, and tons of info on the back.  Now this would ordinarily be enough to brighten my day. But it gets better.  It's mid-day on a Wednseday. Everyone is running around from lunch or to meetings, appointments etc. The street is filled with conservative, mid-town suits. I'm walking up to him, standing by him, and walking past him for all of about 5 minutes and everyone I see (EVERYONE I SEE) is smiling, laughing, happy to see him. Walking up to him and taking his leaflets and *thanking him* for them.  This is New York people. Folks don't (a) take leaflets, /OR/ (b) thank people for them.   The response was outstanding. Unbelievable. Exciting. Hope-inspiring.  Now ... take that Bush / Cheney!  LIIIIAAAARRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSSSS!

When she graduated it seemed she was probably the 5th last black person to do so there. However ... the poor bi-racial dude they let in for fall who is being forced to rep for the en-tire race sho'nuf has some hard times a'comin.   He's never gonna get a quorum at the black student union events. he's gonna have to rap for street cred like, all day dude, and serve on every damned diversity committee on campus! How he'll get any studying done is anyone's guess. Then, of course, his abyssimal grades will be the perfect excuse to go searching for the anachronistic "octaroon" to admit for 2005.   Sigh.

      Okay ... so here's the list of women to listen to:   1.  urlLink Laura Flanders . Pretty self explanatory. She's dope. She's coast to coast. Daytime on Working Assets Radio with  urlLink Farai Chideya  who would also be on this list but ... it'd be redundant now.   2.  urlLink Randi Rhodes . Now, the top three here are all Air America, and The Feeder has her own input on why that is. Me? I don't care. Plus, I still can't work the remote control much, so it's what she leaves on for me to listen to  all day . I gotta say, Randi is the highlight of my day.  NOTE TO RANDI: IF I COULD CALL IN, I WOULD! This no opposable thumb thing sucks some times. But hey, I can lick my own ... (p.s. I'm in New York. I'll be your friend!)      This is from the Feeder: I got hooked on talk radio back in the 80s w/ NPR. I was in bed w/ my last boyfriend, the amazingly well endowed Trini-boy whose parents were *so* glad we were together ("Thank God s/he's dating someone black in this snowy village!") My dear ol' ma wanted to wed me off quick ... how quickly she'd become even more depressed that she'd failed.    Anyway ... A.M. Homes' first book,  urlLink The Safety of Objects , still among my favorite books of all time, was being promo'd. They had her on giving a reading. I was wedded. I was hooked. I thought ... well, fuck my family. If she can do this, so can I! And here we are.    Unfortunately, NPR sucks Republican/Exxon/Mobile dick now. So,   3.  urlLink Janeane Garofalo  & Sam Seder on The Majority Report.      Submit to my willl. You know you want to listen.     DO. IT. NOW.

      So I'm feeling a little miffed by the seeming Tony-award-esque apathy (go Phylicia! go Audra! Go Other black girl! go Puppets!) of "those meddling kids" (a/k/a american youth) toward our political system today.    Of course, I could substitute just about anything into that sentence in place of "political system". Now, I'm only 10 years old (This November-ish), and I'm not even human, but dammit  I'd  vote if I could! Now perhaps it's because The Feeder's black and came of age during the whole Jesse Jackson for president, Ferraro for VP age of the icky-dickly 80s (we're not mentioning any names here. It's been done (see last week)), but this whole "If Kerry doesn't pull some saxophone playing Arsenio stunt it's all over for him" cry for style is getting to be a bit much.    Now I don't remember the '92 election, but The Feeder does. She was an idealistic UC Berkeley College student and yeah. She voted for him. She wanted to   l-i-v-e.   Same deal today kids ... New Bush, New Life-or-Death election. Sigh. My 9 lives are all being threatened here kids ... I'm counting on you to, uh, make it clap.   Now it's time for me to give a shout out to Lizzie ... my fornication-loving, voyeuristic sister in Brooklyn. Yes, it's true. Cats love to watch people get it on. We're spayed for heaven's sake.

Green vs. Gold? Foot vs. Ass? (oh yeah. we've already got that one)   I'm Sheeba Baby, and I will be a commander in fur who will NEVER mislead us into war!

       urlLink    Yes ... we've already flipped 5 out of 8 states from red to blue.  Let's keep 'em comin!  Bring on Arkansas, Nevada & Ohio! Join your brethren/sistren in Florida, Missouri, New Hampshire (by 8.9pts!), Tennessee & West Virginia & let's kick some elephant ass!  Eh, hem.   My name is Sheeba and I approved this message while choking down a particularly fuzzy hairball.

      This is another interesting Brit perspective ...    urlLink ... but is Kerry the answer? - [Sunday Herald] :   "Al-Qaeda sees Bush as its best bet for a continuing jihad and would only launch another terrorist atrocity in the US this year if the president looked like losing the election. By rallying Americans around the flag, George W Bush might be bombed back into office, but that is not an outcome for which anyone in 10 Downing Street will be praying. "  MY QUESTION: If we blitz Bush, will they blitz Blair? (Sheeeit, at this point, I'd even trade.)
