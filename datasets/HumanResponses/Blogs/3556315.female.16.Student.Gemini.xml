      [ OsT : World Filled With LoVe - craig david ]  Reborn. From failure. From sadness. From bad past. From disappointment. From deep sorrow. From depression. From grief. From misery.     The sun'll come out  Tomorrow  Bet your bottom dollar  That tomorrow  There'll be sun!   Just thinkin' about  Tomorrow  Clears away the cobwebs,  And the sorrow  'Til there's none!   When I'm stuck with a day  That's gray,  And lonely,  I just stick out my chin  And Grin,  And Say,  Oh   The sun'll come out  Tomorrow  So ya gotta hang on  'til tomorrow  Come what may   Tomorrow!

      [OsT : Tamia's Officially Missing You]  I don't feel to write something these days... Especially today. It seems that everything goes wrong and sad, plus teary. Bad day, i may say. Really. I'm not in mood to write more. It has been hours and I still feel it's just only another bad dream, and I'm going to wake up soon.  But it's really not. It's a reality. I must face it. He must, she must. I don't want to describe who 'he' is, and who 'she' is. Life goes on, life never stops only for waiting. Failure is only a delayed success. Don't you ever give up.  *Ganbatte for 2 persons i love much!*  [ m i t a ]

      [OsT : Un-Touch-Able -- M / Lee MinWoo]                                                                      ---XXX---  what does flash through in your mind when you hear triple x / XXX ?? Vin Diesel? Or ,,,some dirty minds ...?? Weekekekeek ¬.¬ Just admit it!  Mmm... it's not about those things. Triple X at my school is kind of  workshop that my school hold for spending our spare time properly before our holiday start.   Xplore,Xperiment,Xperience -> yah dunno the right order, but it does contain those words! Wekekekeke   (We've finished our final exams last June 2) Our principal thinks it's a very good way for us to study some more, something different with general studies we have in class like math, social studies, physics, or chemistry isntead of wandering in malls.  At first, i thought it's going to be a boring one, just like our journalism workshop. But it was't boring at all, yah.. it wasn't very interesting too, but it's good i say.  I'll tell u more later on, a skirt to be bought now by me at GaLeri Keris wekekekekekek!!  bayyyyy!!! MwAcKz! --mitoy--

      HULLOW !~ [OST : Dong Bang Shin Ki's Hug]   -> ost is the song i listen when i write some postings, kekekekekek... Original Soundtrack of Mita's Bloggieeee.... hohohohoho!   hiii... this is my first posting on my 'new' blog.. wekeekek... i forgot my old username and its password... and after I tried to figuring them up for 15 minutes, i decided to make a new one... kekekekekek...   SIMPLYMITA  is actually like this -> SimplyME(mi)Ta, kekekekek... nice address, isnt it?? yes it is of course! hohohho =) the idea popped up when i had a chatting with  urlLink Evita .   hmmm.. i chose  MiLky Way  coz it sounds so yummmmiieee... and more, it one of my most fav song from BoA.. the Korean Pop Diva. . . YEPP! I'm a big fan of Korean Pop Music, or aka. Kpop...!!!!~ i began to fall in love with Kpop around a year and half ago, i guess..  Now, i'm really interested to Korea, their pop music, their language, their culture, their TV channel (hahahaha) and everything related to Korea. And I fell for their famous group-singers :  SHINHWA!  They have everything u know...   1. great voice  (They can SING! they're not just an ordinary boyband...) 2. very nice songs plus very meaningful lyrics  3. good faces  (at least, they make me and other fans to fall in lub for them.  Most of my friends keep bugging me like this "where's the point for calling them handsome ?? i can't even  tell them apart!" hahahaha... I'm not going to argue. They have a lot of fans yelling their name everytime, it's a big proof, that I'm not the only one who say that they're DEADLY HANDSOME ! kekekekekek =P)  4. they're great dancers too!  5. and more more more more...   Kekekek.. most of them don't understand why I like Kpop very much, but yah.. everyone has their own interest, rite? I found out Kpop is so good, so i love it very much, just like others love Britney, Maroon5, Black Eyed Peas and more... hahaha! I was successful  to influence several of my friends to fall in love to Shinhwa... WeKekekekek, i think i'll make a good Shinhwa's Promoting Manager...!  Wahh.. i think it's quite long for a fist posting, so i just stop here, k??  annyong, ---mitoy---
