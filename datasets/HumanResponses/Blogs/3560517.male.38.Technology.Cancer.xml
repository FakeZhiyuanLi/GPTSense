      I saw this exchange on TV this morning.  Brokaw was totallly dismayed with the PM.  I could tell he really wanted to say "Don't you understand Bush lied.  There wre no WMDs, no ties to al qaeda, he rushed to war. What's wrong with you !!!"  It was very amusing to watch.  Kevin   Brokaw Raps Iraqi PM for Linking Saddam to 9/11   NBC "Nightly News" anchorman Tom Brokaw was so dismayed Tuesday night when Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi linked Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks that he actually reprimanded him during his interview.  When Brokaw asked the new Iraqi leader if he could "understand why many Americans feel that so many young men and women have died here for purposes other than protecting the United States?" Dr. Allawi responded: "We know that this is an extension to what has happened in New York. And the war [has] been taken out to Iraq by the same terrorists. Saddam was a potential friend and partner and natural ally of terrorism."  Plainly miffed that Dr. Allawi hadn't accepted the U.S. media's attempt to cover-up links between Saddam, al Qaida and 9/11, Brokaw reprimanded him as cameras rolled:  "Prime minister, Im surprised that you would make the connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq. The 9/11 commission in America says there is no evidence of a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and those terrorists of al-Qaida."  But Dr. Allawi refused to back down, telling the top TV anchor:   "No. I believe very strongly that Saddam had relations with al-Qaida. And these relations started in Sudan. We know Saddam had relationships with a lot of terrorists and international terrorism. Now, whether he is directly connected to the September atrocities or not, I cant vouch for this. But definitely I know he has connections with extremism and terrorists."  In December Dr. Allawi commented on a recently discovered Iraqi intelligence document placing lead 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta in Baghdad two months before the attacks.  "We are uncovering evidence all the time of Saddam's involvement with al-Qaeda," he told the London Telegraph. "But this is the most compelling piece of evidence that we have found so far. It shows that not only did Saddam have contacts with al-Qaeda, he had contact with those responsible for the September 11 attacks."

       More ties between Iraq and al qaeda the "mainstream media" continues to ignore    CBS, CNN & NBC Skip Iraq Outreach to bin Laden Over Saudi Arabia  Spiked by CBS, CNN and NBC again. Exactly a week after the CBS Evening News, CNN’s NewsNight and the NBC Nightly News ignored Russian President Vladimir Putin’s disclosure that Russian intelligence warned the Bush administration after 9-11 that Saddam Hussein planned to attack inside the U.S., the very same newscasts managed to skip over a Friday front page New York Times story about how top operatives in Hussein’s regime approached bin Laden in the mid-1990s about working together against the Saudi ruling family and foreigners in Saudi Arabia. Friday’s CBS Evening News, however, had time for hyperventilation about how “partisan bickering in Washington” supposedly reached “a new low as the Vice President lets loose with...'the' four-letter word" and for a story blaming the war in Iraq for a polio outbreak in Nigeria.

       The NYT/CBS Poll follows the LA Times poll by over sampling Dems.  I guess if your candidate can't pull ahead on his own, it makes sense to stack the poll to make it look like he is winning.  Kevin   Generally speaking, do you usually consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what?  Republican = 29% Democrat = 35% Independent/Don't Know = 36%   Over the last month, Bush has gained ground in all major polls except Wash Post.  Somehow, while other polls show Bush gaining, their poll shows Kerry surging.  I wonder how much they over sampled Dems in their poll???    Poll Dates Net Gain   CBS News & CBS/NYT 5/20-23 vs 6/23-27 Bush +7  Fox News/OpDyn 5/18-19 vs 6/22-23 Bush + 6  CNN/Gallup/USAT 5/21-23 vs. 6/21-23 Bush +3  WaPo/ABC News 5/20-23 vs 6/17-6/20 Kerry + 6  Rasmussen and Battleground polls also showed Bush gaining ground in the last month.

       So, the leftwing journalists are now resorting to calling Bush the Devil.  Not sure if that is better or worse than Hitler.  Unbelievable !!!  Kevin   Why did the mostly liberal crowd at last week's Washington premiere--people who like to think of themselves as thoughtful and fair-minded--applaud so unrestrainedly?  They applauded, I suspect, for much the same reason so many members of the black Christian middle-class applaud the harangues of Black Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan. Some of his facts may be wrong and some of his connections strained, but his attitude is right. What's more, he'll say in plain language what nice, educated people cannot bring themselves to say: The man is a devil.

       The same objective reviewers who slammed the Passion of the Christ, applaud Fahrenheit 911 for the same themes.  Kevin    A.O. Scott, New York Times:  "Fahrenheit": "Mr. Moore's populist instincts have never been sharper. . . . He is a credit to the republic." "Passion": "Gibson has exploited the popular appetite for terror and gore for what he and his allies see as a higher end."   Ty Burr, Boston Globe:  "Fahrenheit": "Should be seen because it takes off the gloves and wades into the fray, because it synthesizes the anti-Bush argument like no other work before it, and because it forces you to decide for yourself exactly where passion starts to warp point of view." "Passion": "If you come seeking theological subtlety, let alone such modern inventions as psychological depth, you'll walk away battered and empty-handed."   David Edelstein, Slate:  "Fahrenheit": After the screening, a friend railed that Moore was exploiting a mother's grief. I suggested that the scene made moral sense in the context of the director's universe, that the exploitation is justified if it saves the lives of other mothers' sons. "Passion": "A two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie--The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre--that thinks it's an act of faith."   Eric Harrison, Houston Chronicle:  "Fahrenheit": "[Moore] is an indispensable treasure, and his imperfections are part of the reason, because they mark him as real." "Passion": "It's awful because everything he knows about storytelling has been swept aside by proselytizing zeal."   Geoff Pevre, Toronto Star:  "Fahrenheit": "A plea for America's deliverance. . . . It may not be an argument one agrees with, and it may be unbalanced and propagandistic, but it is both convincingly argued and sincerely motivated." "Passion": "A work of fundamentalist pornography."   David Sterrit, Christian Science Monitor:  "Fahrenheit": "Is the label 'documentary' appropriate for this openly activist movie? Of course it is, unless you cling to some idealized notion of 'objective' film." "Passion": "The highly selective screenplay includes only a few of Jesus' words, spoken in occasional flashback scenes."   James Verniere, Boston Herald:  "Fahrenheit": "At a time when the film industry is turning out sugarcoated, content-free junk, Moore has given American viewers a renewed taste for raw meat." "Passion": "An exercise in sadomasochistic bullying."

       If there was any doubt left about whether or not the press was totally partisan...read the below.  While the press spent all last week mis-reporting what the staff report supposedly said about links between Iraq and al qaeda, they completely ignored what the report said about the impact the war on terror has had on al qaeda.  They should be ashamed at how blatantly corrupt and partisan they have become; for no reason other than to try to sway the election this year.  Kevin    9/11 Commission: U.S. Terror War has Stymied al Qaida   The Sept. 11 Commission has found that the Bush administration's war on terror has severely impaired al Qaida's ability to organize another spectacular attack against the U.S. homeland by capturing or killing the deadly terror group's key leaders, drying up their financial resources and severely limiting their ability to "strategize, plan attacks, and dispatch operatives worldwide."  The bombshell finding, buried at the end of the Commission's Staff Statement No. 15, should have been hailed in the press as evidence that we've at least turned the corner in the war on terror - and may indeed have the enemy on the run. Instead, reporters have ignored this particular Commission finding since its release on June 16.   "Since the September 11 attacks and the defeat of the Taliban, as Qaeda's funding has decreased significantly. The arrests or deaths of several important financial facilitators have decreased the amount of money al Qaeda has raised and increased the costs and difficulty of raising and moving that money.  "Some entirely corrupt charities are now out of business, with many of their principals killed or captured, although some charities may still be providing support to al Qaeda.  "Moreover, it appears that the al Qaeda attacks within Saudi Arabia in May and November 2003 have reduced - perhaps drastically - at Qaeda's ability to raise funds from Saudi sources. Both an increase in Saudi enforcement and a more negative perception of al Qaeda by potential donors have cut its income."   "Prior to 9/11, al Qaeda was a centralized organization which used Afghanistan as a war room to strategize, plan attacks, and dispatch operatives worldwide." But now, says the Commission, "Bin Ladin's* seclusion [has] forced operational commanders and cell leaders to assume greater authority; they are now making the command decisions previously made by him."   In other words, whether dead or alive, the prime mover behind the Sept. 11 attacks has been taken out of commission, with operational authority handed over to allies of convenience like Abu Musab al Zarqawi.  And while Zarqawi has mounted dozens of operations throughout the Middle East in recent months, including a deadly chem-bomb plot foiled by Jordanian authorities in April, his focus these days seems to be pretty much on Iraq - not America.  And even there, Zarqawi seems to be feeling the heat lately. According to the recent communique he sent to bin Laden, published on Islamic web sites earlier this month, he complained about being "squeezed" by U.S. forces.  "The space of movement is starting to get smaller," he told the 9/11 chief. "The [U.S.] grip is starting to be tightened on the holy warriors' necks and, with the spread of soldiers and police, the future [for our side] is becoming frightening."  To be sure, the 9/11 Commission did not attribute any success in the terror war to the president by name, though as its leader and chief strategist, that conclusion is inescapable.   Still, when the 9/11 Commission reports: "Al Qaeda today is more a loose collection of regional networks with a greatly weakened central organization," it's hard not to conclude President Bush's war on terror is making significant progress.   Unless you're a journalist.

       These speak for themselves.  Kevin   "The Iraqi people made history today, and so did John Kerry with his unprecedented pessimism about today's progress in Iraq, Kerry revealed his cynicism when he  complained that not enough of the money he voted against is being spent  and that the contributions of NATO and our allies aren't 'real.' " Bush spokesman - Steve Schmidt  "The hard Left in America has gone European. They live in a fantasy world in which dictators are virtuous as long as they're anti-American. They care nothing for human rights or women's rights — unless Washington can be blamed for abuses, real or imagined. As far as the Left is concerned, America is always wrong. When making strategic decisions, ignore them entirely" Ralph Peters - NYPost

       The party that demanded campaign finance reform has outraised Republicans by 10-1 in 527 soft money.  So much for money corrupting politics.  Kevin  Only one of the top 25 donors to political 527 groups has given to a conservative organization, shedding further light on the huge disparity between Democrats and Republicans in this new fund-raising area.  The top three 527 donors so far in the 2004 election cycle - Hollywood producer Steven Bing, Progressive Corp. chairman Peter Lewis and financier George Soros - have combined to give nearly $24 million to prominent liberal groups. They include Joint Victory Campaign 2004, America Coming Together and MoveOn.org.   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks 527 data,  liberal organizations have amassed nearly $80 million in donations compared to a mere $8 million for their conservative counterparts.  Groups are categorized as 527s for the section of tax code that regulates them.  The liberal-leaning groups' big advantage is expected to benefit Democrat presidential candidate John Kerry, according to campaign finance watchdogs. Even though the 527 groups are prohibited by law from consulting with the Kerry campaign or Democratic National Committee, they can air television ads supporting him and criticizing President Bush.

       Now USA Today exposes Kerry's lies about college tuition and exposes the higher tuition scam. Kevin  USA Today blows a big hole in one of Kerry's biggest rhetorical points:  What students pay on average for tuition at public universities has fallen by nearly one-third since 1998, thanks to new federal tax breaks and a massive increase in state and federal grants to most students and their families.   Contrary to the widespread perception that tuition is soaring out of control, a USA TODAY analysis found that what students actually pay in tuition and fees — rather than the published tuition price — has declined for a vast majority of students attending four-year public universities. In fact, today's students have enjoyed the greatest improvement in college affordability since the GI bill provided benefits for returning World War II veterans.   What made the difference: a $22 billion annual increase in grants and tax breaks since 1998.   That 80% jump in financial aid — targeting middle-class families earning $40,000 to $100,000 a year — has more than offset dramatic increases in tuition prices.   "College still takes a big chunk out of most families' income. But the average student is much better off today than headlines would have you believe," says Sandy Baum, an economist who co-authors an annual report on college costs for the College Board, which oversees college entrance exams.  For months, John Kerry - while insisting he is an optimist - has been saying that higher education is absolutely out of reach for the middle class in America. Which is about as accurate as his claim that we're in the worst economy since the Great Depression.  From Kerry's issues page on his web site: "While George Bush gives tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, students are struggling to find the support they need to succeed.   Back on April 12: A Kerry release stated, "George Bush’s reckless fiscal policies have led to the largest state fiscal crisis in fifty years.   Back on April 14: Kerry charged that "the administration's domestic policies have put the cost of college out of reach for many young Americans  Kerry said Bush's economic policies have squeezed middle-class families. "College tuitions have gone up 28 percent in the last three years.   At public universities, students are paying roughly 27 percent of the official tuition price. Students pay more at private schools, but private tuition actually paid has gone up only 7 percent during the past five years, less than the 20 percent rise in the official price.  It is positively raining college aid, meaning students are in a tight competition with the elderly over who can be more pampered by government. Eight new federal tuition tax breaks have been created since 1997. Total federal and state financial aid hit a record $49 billion in 2003, according to USA Today.  The game for universities is obvious — hike official tuition rates ever higher. Then everyone thinks students cannot afford college and plies them with more aid, which ends up lining the pockets of the schools. It's one of the great scams of our time, and Kerry has been happy to play along by hyping nominal tuition increases and promising yet more aid. He is the dream candidate of greedy college administrators.  The problem isn't that students hungry for knowledge are being frozen out from college, but the opposite. Marginal students take their generous aid and go to colleges that don't teach them. Eighty percent of universities aren't selective, e.g. more or less happy to accept anyone who shows up with a check. Only 37 percent of first-time freshmen graduate in four years, and only 60 percent graduate in six years. Universities are happy to take money from unprepared students and fail them right back out, or dumb down their standards to stay on the government-aid gravy train.

       More interesting items from that new New York Times poll:  "Nearly 40 percent of Americans say they do not have an opinion about Senator John Kerry, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.  Among those who do have an opinion, Mr. Kerry is disliked more than he is liked (35 percent!). More than 50 percent of respondents said that Mr. Kerry says what he thinks voters want to hear...  The 35 percent have a negative opinion of Kerry factoid is buried in the next to last paragraph, with 36 percent having no opinion. If my math is correct, this leaves a mere 29 percent of the respondents having a positive opinion of Kerry.    EVEN BAD POLLS DESERVE BETTER HEADLINES [06/28 10:58 PM]   But even shaky polls deserve accurate headlines. From the AP we learn that in the May CBS/New York Times poll, Kerry led Bush by 8 percentage points in a two-way matchup, and by 6 points in a three-way matchup. The headline was "Kerry Surges Ahead og Bush".  The newest one shows Kerry had 45 percent support and Bush by 44 percent in the poll. In a three-way matchup, Kerry and Bush were still running even while independent Ralph Nader is at 5 percent.   So one could conclude the big story is Bush pulling even, right? An eight point lead has evaporated into a one-point lead. Big news, right?    The New York Times headline? "Bush's Rating Falls to Its Lowest Point." The head-to-head numbers are in the 11th paragraph.

       In his latest rant, Gore made the below quote referring to Bush supporters as "Digital Brownshirts".  The brownshirts were the Nazi SS troops that rounded up dissenters in Germany.  Real nice.  I guess when you have nothing of substance to offer you resort to name calling.  Kevin    Gore:  The [Bush] administration works closely with a network of "rapid response" digital brownshirts who work to pressure reporters and their editors for "undermining support for our troops."   "brownshirts"--i.e., Nazi storm troopers   PS  The Kerry campaign is all upset about a Bush internet ad that uses images of the foaming at the mouth liberals and uses clips from the Bush is Hitler ads Moveon.org made earlier in the year.  They didn't make a peep at the time.  Now that Bush is showing the ads as an example of what he is up against the Kerry camp is offended that anyone would use an image of Hitler.  Guess he hasn't been paying attention to how his party campaigns lately.

       Check out the below headline from today's Wash Post.  According to them, the choice is health care or tax cuts.  (anyone want to guess which side they are on?)  Also note they label Bruce Bartlett "conservative", but do not label Reischauser or his think tank "liberal".  Nope, no bias there !!!  Kevin    The Choice for Voters: Health Care or Tax Cuts   Policy Costs Crowd Out Other Initiatives   "These are pretty stark differences," said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and former head of the Congressional Budget Office. "Kerry is expansive and wants to preserve and strengthen the role government has played in the economic and social life of the republic, and Bush would like to scale back the role of government to the most basic services of protection of life and liberty and a safety net for those who really have no ability to care for themselves."   Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist with the National Center for Policy Analysis, offered a similar analysis. "Maybe that should be the campaign slogan: If you want slightly higher taxes and more federal spending on health care, vote for John Kerry," he said.

       A front page story in the Financial Times today confirms the British claim that Iraq was in the market for yellowcake uranium prior to the war.  This of course will be ignored by all US media outlets !!!  Kevin   Illicit sales of uranium from Niger were being negotiated with five states including Iraq at least three years before the US-led invasion, senior European intelligence officials have told the Financial Times.  Intelligence officers learned between 1999 and 2001 that uranium smugglers planned to sell illicitly mined Nigerien uranium ore, or refined ore called yellow cake, to Iran, Libya, China, North Korea and Iraq.  These claims support the assertion made in the British government dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programme in September 2002 that Iraq had sought to buy uranium from an African country, confirmed later as Niger. George W. Bush, US president, referred to the issue in his State of the Union address in January 2003.  The claim that the illicit export of uranium was under discussion was widely dismissed when letters referring to the sales - apparently sent by a Nigerien official to a senior official in Saddam Hussein's regime - were proved by the International Atomic Energy Agency to be forgeries. This embarrassed the US and led the administration to reverse its earlier claim.  But European intelligence officials have for the first time confirmed that information provided by human intelligence sources during an operation mounted in Europe and Africa produced sufficient evidence for them to believe that Niger was the centre of a clandestine international trade in uranium.  Officials said the fake documents, which emerged in October 2002 and have been traced to an Italian with a record for extortion and deception, added little to the picture gathered from human intelligence and were only given weight by the Bush administration.  According to a senior counter-proliferation official, meetings between Niger officials and would-be buyers from the five countries were held in several European countries, including Italy. Intelligence officers were convinced that the uranium would be smuggled from abandoned mines in Niger, thereby circumventing official export controls. "The sources were trustworthy. There were several sources, and they were reliable sources," an official involved in the European intelligence gathering operation said.  The UK government used the details in its Iraq weapons dossier, which it used to justify war with Iraq after concluding that it corresponded with other information it possessed, including evidence gathered by GCHQ, the UK eavesdropping centre, of a visit to Niger by an Iraqi official.  However, the European investigation suggested that it was the smugglers who were actively looking for markets, though it was unclear how far the deals had progressed and whether deliveries of uranium were made.

      Webster's defines alliance as an "association to further the common interests of the members." The camaraderie on display at today's opening of the NATO summit in Istanbul notwithstanding, the past two years have seen little evidence that the organization still fits this definition.  The summiteers can be expected to make much of NATO's deployment of five more "provincial reconstruction teams" to Afghanistan--teams that were promised months ago but never delivered. Similarly, NATO's European leaders will congratulate each other for agreeing to train Iraqi security services, a job France and Germany somehow intend to accomplish without sending any troops to Iraq. If that's all the help the U.S. can get from our partners, it may be time to rethink the underlying premise of this "alliance."   The excuse offered by the Germans and French is that they disagree with the U.S. on what constitute "common interests." But it is not plausible that Europe has a lesser stake in pacifying terrorists and terrorist regimes than does the U.S. A more honest explanation is that America's security umbrella has allowed Europeans to underfund their military services to the point that even if there were a trans-Atlantic consensus, they would have little to offer.  Even in Afghanistan, which Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer calls NATO's "number one priority," the allies' record is abysmal. The actual fighting is still being done by some 20,000 American-led troops outside the NATO structure. All Washington asked the alliance to do last August was to help pacify and rebuild the country. NATO was able to muster a mere 6,500 troops, most of which are stationed in the relative safety of Kabul.   Thousands more are needed to bring stability to a country the size of Texas. Instead, the member states are stalling, forcing the Secretary-General to go begging for a chopper here and an airplane there. And as NATO fails to expand from Kabul, the security situation is deteriorating. Elections originally planned for June have been postponed until September. One of the Bush Administration's minimum goals for the Istanbul summit is for NATO to commit a larger force to Afghanistan for 90 days around the time of the elections. The hope is to secure the registration of voters and provide security from terrorists who will surely try their worst to prevent Afghanistan's transition to a full democracy. But even such a temporary commitment is unlikely.  Germany insists that it is not a lack of political will that prevents it from doing more in Afghanistan, where it has 2,000 troops. It says that with missions also in Kosovo and Bosnia, its forces are stretched thin. But if the world's third biggest economy is already exhausted by deploying 7,500 non-fighting troops abroad out of a total force of 270,000, what other than a lack of political will can account for this sorry state of its military affairs?  According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, last year the U.S. spent $417.4 billion on defense or $1,419 per capita. France's total spending was $35 billion or $583 per capita, while Germany spent $27.2 billion or $329 per capita and is planning to freeze defense spending at current levels over the next few years. The French have some 15,000 of their 350,000 troops deployed abroad, though with only 700 serving in Afghanistan. The biggest French foreign mission, 4,000 troops, is in the Cote d'Ivoire--which speaks volumes about the difference between U.S. and French interests.  This sorry NATO record should also bring a dose of reality to American politicians who invoke "multilateralism" like a mantra. Both John Kerry and Joe Biden, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, are demanding that Mr. Bush give NATO a larger role in Iraq, but the President would surely do so if the Europeans were willing. The two Democrats are either out of touch with current European opinion, or they are using NATO as a political club to beat up Mr. Bush, or both. At least Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Richard Lugar is alert to the problem, warning the Europeans last week that "NATO's reputation will stand or fall" depending on its assistance in Iraq.   Earlier this month, the U.S. and Europe commemorated the sacrifices of American soldiers on the Normandy beaches to liberate Europe from the Nazis in 1944. For the next 60 years, American taxpayers footed most of the bill to protect Europe, most recently deploying forces to stop the Balkan wars. Somehow Europeans appear to believe Americans will continue doing this indefinitely, regardless of European behavior and attitudes. They are badly mistaken.

       The "Mainstream Media" has totally ignored this story since it broke and the Dems are making a mockery of the hearings on capital hill.  Guess they don't want anybody to know how screwed up the All Mighty UN really is; since it is the Dems answer to everything.  Kevin   WHAT are the Congressional hearings to discover the truth about the United Nations' oil-for-food scandal? According to some of the committee's Democratic representatives, the hearings are a "misguided effort to discredit the United Nations."  In other words - according to House Reps. Tom Lantos, Howard Berman and Gary Ackerman - it apparently doesn't matter what happened to the $2 billion worth of bribe money paid to 270 diplomats and politicians, or the $10 billion allegedly stolen by Saddam Hussein.   Why? Because the truth about France, Germany and Russia's opposition to the war in Iraq might not be helpful for Democrats in the 2004 elections. The party and their presidential candidate, who worship at the altar of "U.N. solutions" for world problems (including terror) might be forced to admit that the object of their continuing affection is a cesspool of anti-American, bribe-taking liars. Liars who are perfectly willing to stonewall any investigation - apparently with the blessings of certain Democratic committee members.   Once again, like the 9/11 committee before it, the truth will take a back seat to partisan politics. Once again, Democrats will likely dishonor themselves in the process of trying to dishonor the president. And once again, Americans will see right through the subterfuge.

       Once again, the Dems play the Hitler card.  The NYTimes, which railed against Scalia for appearance of conlfict of interest, has no problem with a sitting judge openly calling for the defeat of a candidate, which is against the judicial code of conduct.  Kevin   A few months ago the New York Times was among those who tried to brew up a kerfuffle over Justice Antonin Scalia's decision not to recuse himself from considering a case involving the office of the vice president. The argument was that because Scalia is a personal friend of the man who currently holds that office, his opinion would somehow create a conflict of interest, or at least the "appearance" of same--never mind that whatever precedent the court sets would apply to all future vice presidents, regardless of party.  Now a New York-based federal judge is openly campaigning against George W. Bush, the New York Sun reported Monday:  "In a way that occurred before but is rare in the United States . . . somebody came to power as a result of the illegitimate acts of a legitimate institution that had the right to put somebody in power. That is what the Supreme Court did in Bush versus Gore. It put somebody in power," said Guido Calabresi, a judge on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which sits in Manhattan.  "The reason I emphasize that is because that is exactly what happened when Mussolini was put in by the king of Italy," Judge Calabresi continued, as the allusion drew audible gasps from some in the luncheon crowd Saturday at the annual convention of the American Constitution Society.  But Calabresi didn't stop there. He was just getting started: "The king of Italy had the right to put Mussolini in, though he had not won an election, and make him prime minister. That is what happened when Hindenburg put Hitler in. I am not suggesting for a moment that Bush is Hitler. I want to be clear on that, but it is a situation which is extremely unusual," the judge said.   Well, of course he's not suggesting Bush is like Hitler! He's merely comparing the two; likening, equating, paralleling, relating ... but he would never say Bush is Hitler. Of course not.  According to the Sun, Calabresi "declared that members of the public should, without regard to their political views, expel Mr. Bush from office in order to cleanse the democratic system."  But while Calabresi's remarks themselves are inconsequential, his position as a federal judge makes them highly improper. Blogger Eugene Volokh notes that the  Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges stipulates that "a judge should not . . . publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office."   Well, fortunately, the vigilant defenders of judicial propriety and independence are on the case. The New York Times has an editorial denounc--oh wait, sorry, actually it doesn't have an editorial. Two days after the Sun's scoop, the Old Gray Lady, which supporters call a newspaper, hasn't even bothered wading in with a news story. As we write, a search for "Calabresi" on the Times Web site turns up zilch during the past 30 days. We'll keep you posted.  But gee, you don't suppose all that complaining about Cheney and Scalia was partisan, do you?

       Give USA Today cudos for honesty and joining the Wash Post saying Kerry if full of hot air on the economy.  Kevin   USA TODAY REJECTS KERRY'S ECONOMIC ARGUMENT [06/23 02:25 PM]  Looks like the editors of USA Today have had enough of John Kerry contention that the economy is the worst since the Great Depression. In an editorial titled Kerry's gloomy notes about economy ring hollow, they write, "Kerry has not offered answers for all of the problems he cites. While he would steer more federal money into health care and college education by eliminating part of the tax cut Bush pushed through two years ago, he has no realistic plan for tamping down gas prices, boosting wages or preventing companies from laying off workers. In fact, presidents have little control over short-term economic trends.  By talking down the economy, Kerry may hope to pick up votes in economically struggling states where the November election may be decided. But in doing so, he risks sounding out of touch with millions of Americans who see signs of an improving economy — and want a president with a sunnier outlook. The recent death of former president Ronald Reagan recalls just how powerful an optimistic message can be.  Exaggerating the nation's economic misery is not wise policy or politics. The nation is looking for an upbeat problem-solver, not a gloomy

       Congressman calls on Dems to show same outrage for beheadings they showed for prison abuse.  To date not one Dem had given a speach denouncing the murders, but 45 times spoke against prison abuse.  Kevin    Rep. Mark Foley, Florida Republican, yesterday called on his Democratic colleagues to end their silence on the beheadings of American civilians Nick Berg and Paul M. Johnson Jr. and show the same outrage they showed in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prison incidents.      Mr. Foley, in a floor speech, said no Democratic member of Congress has spoken on the floor of the House about the cruel slaying of Mr. Johnson, yet more then 20 Democratic members have mentioned Abu Ghraib more than 45 times since April.      "Mr. Chairman, I stand here amazed and disappointed in the self-righteous, politically motivated diatribes coming from the other side about Abu Ghraib," Mr. Foley said, adding, "But, what I find especially appalling is the near-deafening silence from the other side following the savage beheadings of American civilians Nick Berg and Paul Johnson."

       Just like they ignore all other anti Dem stories, like voter fraud and illegal campaigning, the major newspapers are ignoring this story. But, hey, it must be a coincidence, there is no liberal bias in the media afterall !!!  Kevin   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - A Democratic group crucial to John Kerry's presidential campaign has paid felons - some convicted of sex offenses, assault and burglary - to conduct door-to-door voter registration drives in at least three election swing states.  America Coming Together, contending that convicted criminals deserve a second chance in society, employs felons as voter canvassers in major metropolitan areas in Missouri, Florida, Ohio and perhaps in other states among the 17 it is targeting in its drive. Some lived in halfway houses, and at least four returned to prison.  ACT canvassers ask residents which issues are important to them and, if they are not registered, sign them up as voters. They gather telephone numbers and other personal information, such as driver's license numbers or partial Social Security numbers, depending on what a state requires for voter registration.  A review of federal campaign finance and state criminal records by The Associated Press revealed that the names and hometowns of dozens of ACT employees in Missouri, Florida and Ohio matched those of people convicted of crimes such as burglary, forgery, drug dealing, assault and sex offenses.  Although it works against the re-election of President Bush, ACT is an independent group not affiliated with Kerry's campaign - federal law forbids such coordination. Yet ACT is stocked with veteran Democratic political operatives, many with past ties to Kerry and his advisers.  Ed Gillespie, the chairman of the Republican Party, issued a statement calling the policy "disturbing" and questioned the use of felons "to go house to house and handle sensitive personal information."

       The Dems were the ones demanding for campaing finance reform and then formed soft money slush funds before the ink was dry on the law.  Now they can't even comply with the law they wanted.  This story came out Tues afternoon and as of 4:00 Wednesday there has been no mention of this in the NYTimes or Wash Post.  Kevin   WASHINGTON – A pro-Democrat group that criticizes President Bush in its fund-raising letters is breaking the law in the types of contributions it uses to finance the mailings, campaign finance watchdog groups said in a complaint.  The three groups said America Coming Together should be using limited "hard money" donations, not unlimited contributions, to pay for the solicitations. The groups - Democracy 21, Center for Responsive Politics and Campaign Legal Center - planned to file the complaint on Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission.   ACT has financed the mailings, possibly up to $1 million worth through March, with soft money, the groups say. Such unlimited donations can come from any source, including unions and corporations, but aren't supposed to be used for federal election activities.  "When Election Day is over, we will have defeated George W. Bush and elected progressive candidates all across the nation," ACT told prospective donors in one recent fund-raising letter. "The extraordinary effort we're undertaking is in response to the extraordinary damage Bush and his allies do, on a daily basis, to values we believe in and to people we care about."  The mailing also notes ACT's desire to defeat Republican members of Congress and GOP lawmakers at the state and local levels.  The watchdog groups contend that because no state and local candidates are named, and Bush, a federal candidate, is the only person on the ballot who is, such solicitations must be funded with hard money.   ACT "has illegally spent soft money on direct-mail public communications that attack and oppose President Bush," said Fred Wertheimer, head of Democracy 21.   ACT was created after the campaign finance law took effect in November 2002 barring the national Democratic and Republican parties from raising soft money. The group is focused on pro-Democratic get-out-the-vote activities in presidential battleground states, efforts the Democratic Party had used soft money to finance.

      THE FUROR OVER "offshoring" of jobs to countries such as India, so pronounced during the Democratic primaries, seems to have faded. With good reason: Last week the Labor Department published the first government effort to quantify the impact of offshoring, which tentatively suggested that it may be responsible for just 2.5 percent of the job losses in the first quarter of this year.   Moreover, job creation, which appeared surprisingly weak a few months ago despite strong economic growth, is now healthy -- and statistical revisions suggest that it was robust as far back as March and respectable in January -- just when the gloom from the Democratic primaries was at its fiercest. After suffering a net loss of 2.7 million jobs between March 2001 and August 2003, the economy has gained 1.4 million jobs.  Now comes the next round of political gloom-mongering. Sen. John F. Kerry, the victor in the Democratic primaries, has been telling voters this week that although job creation may have recovered, wages are the real problem. "In the last year, wages have gone down, and prices have gone up," the candidate told an audience on Tuesday. Actually, hourly wages for non-supervisory workers have risen this year by 2.2 percent as of May, so they kept pace with consumer price inflation. Precise statements about whether the new jobs being created pay more or less than average are not possible, because it takes months for these data to be assembled. But it is possible to say that new job creation, which in the early stages of the recovery was concentrated at low-paying employers such as restaurants, has now broadened to include manufacturing and other sectors where wages are higher than average.  If Mr. Kerry's message seems exaggerated now, it will seem even less convincing soon. Job markets recover in three phases: As the economy picks up, employers ask workers to put in extra hours; when they've exhausted that option, they hire new workers; when new workers become hard to find, labor scarcity pushes wages upward. We are now well into the second stage and may be entering the third.   In any case, there is not much that President Bush -- or a President Kerry -- can do to influence this process. On Friday, Mr. Kerry proposed an increase in the minimum wage, and this could help; but it would only reach workers at the very bottom, and if this policy were pushed too far, it could slow new job creation.   Mr. Kerry has clearly decided that voters want him to feel their pain, and he's willing to deliver what his audience expects from him. This may be sound politics, but it distracts from the serious criticisms of Mr. Bush's record that an opponent should be making. Mr. Bush's tax cuts have created a fiscal crisis far bigger than the nation appears to understand. Fixing it will require a style of leadership that faces tough choices -- which is not what Mr. Kerry is providing.

       Why is it that Dems never met a vote fraud scheme they didn't fight for?  How does asking people to show ID before voting discriminate?  This is one of the most important things we do and they want NO CONTROLS what so ever on ensuring only legal votes are cast.  Kevin   The level of suspicion between the two parties is greater than ever. John Kerry says he believes Al Gore "won" the 2000 election and has assembled a team of 2,000 lawyers to "challenge anyplace in America where you cannot trace the vote and count the votes." Republicans have their own legal team to combat fake voter registrations, absentee-ballot fraud and residents of nursing homes being overly "assisted" to cast votes. Maria Cardona of the New Democrat Network dismisses such concerns, saying "ballot security and preventing voter fraud are just code words for voter intimidation and suppression." Liberal legal groups are suing to set aside laws in some of the 11 states that require photo ID at the polls on the grounds they discriminate against the poor and minorities.

       This is unreal !!!  The Philadelphis Daily News not only endorsed Kerry last week, they published a link to Kerry's website and urged people to contribute to him.  What's next, the NY Times hosting a Kerry Fundraiser.  So much for a non partisan press !!!  Kevin   On Wednesday the Philadelphia Daily News became, by its own reckoning, the first newspaper in the nation to endorse John Kerry for president in November. The paper went beyond the usual endorsement and vowed to take an active role in winning the election for Kerry:  Kerry, who fought in the swamps of Vietnam, can lead us out of the quagmire of the Bush administration--but for that to happen, he will need your help.  Past presidential election strategies focused on the "undecided" or "swing" voters. This election, we're pushing a different strategy: We're focusing on the people poll-takers call "unlikely" voters.  The paper goes on to exhort readers to register to vote and to "get others" to do so. It provides Kerry's Web site address and urges readers to make a donation. "You can help Kerry win Pennsylvania," the paper says. "Act now. The commonwealth--indeed the nation--cannot afford another four years of George Bush."  We believe in free speech, so we have no problem with this. But if a company other than a media conglomerate (the News is owned by Knight Ridder Newspapers) undertook such an effort on behalf of a political candidate, surely the Federal Election Commission would be all over it. Perhaps the FEC should take up the question of Knight Ridder's electioneering for Kerry. It'd make an interesting test case.

       Partisan media uses lies and distorts commission's report to try to make president look bad.  Ignoring the truth and distorting what the staff report said, the media was salivating over the chance to attack the president once again.  Tne report never said there were no links between Iraq and Al Qaeda.  They said there was no "credible evidence" Iraq wa involved with the 9/11 attacks.  The media twisted this for their partisan agenda and then even refused to report when the chairmen refuted what the media reported.  Kevin   "Panel Finds No Qaeda-Iraq Tie" went the Times headline. "Al Qaeda-Hussein Link Is Dismissed" front-paged The Washington Post. The A.P. led with the thrilling words "Bluntly contradicting the Bush Administration, the commission. . . ." This understandably caused my editorial-page colleagues to draw the conclusion that "there was never any evidence of a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. . . ."    What a bunch of crap...below are several links documenting ties between Iraq and al qaeda.   http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2004-06-17-hadley_x.htm  http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=39025  http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/5/27/100047.shtml  http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1156035/posts  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/opinion/21SAFI.html?ex=1088395200&en=6def8ee2f0b48d06&ei=5006&partner=ALTAVISTA1  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/248eaurh.asp

       Why is it that the Dems always have to exploit the race issue to try to win elections?  From saying Reps would take away their rights to, running commercials re-enacting the dragging death in Texas to saying electing Reps would cause more black churches to be burned.  It never fails.  Kevin   Yesterday we noted that John Kerry had claimed, in a Columbus, Ohio, speech, that more black Americans are in prison than in college. It turns out that KERRY LIED!!!! Blogger Clyde Middleton has the numbers (links below in PDF):  The US [Department of Justice] tells us the number of blacks incarcerated at mid-year 2002 (page 11, Table 13): 818,900 black men; 65,600 black women; total 884,500 blacks.  The US Census Bureau tells us the number of blacks in college during 2002: 802,000 black men; 1,476,000 black women; total 2,278,000 blacks.  It's true that among black men the number of prison inmates was slightly higher than the number of college students. But as the Statistical Assessment Service notes, this is a meaningless comparison, since "you can go to prison at any age, but are most likely to be in college between the ages of 18-24." A college-age black man, it turns out, is 2.5 times as likely to be in college as in prison. Also worth noting: A career criminal can easily end up spending decades of his life behind bars, while only the laziest student stays in college that long.

       The media completely ignores the 9/11 chairmen when they question the way the media is portraying the commissions's own findings.  Unbelievable !!!  Kevin   In the “Grapevine” segment on Special Report with Brit Hume, Jim Angle explained:       “9-11 Commission Co-Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, said today there is no disagreement between the commission and the administration over links between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. But most news organizations last night said the commission’s conclusion, that there was no quote, ‘collaborative relationship’ between the two was evidence the administration deliberately misled the public. CBS Evening News said the commission quote, ‘directly contradicted one of President Bush’s justifications for going to war against Iraq.’ ABC said the report quote, ‘unequivocally’ disputed the Bush administration’s claims of an al-Qaeda-Iraq link. NBC reported that the commission is ‘sharply at odds with what leading members of the administration continue to claim.’       “A front page headline in today’s New York Times reads quote, ‘Panel Finds No Qaeda-Iraq Tie.’ And the Washington Post says quote, ‘al-Qaeda-Hussein Link is Dismissed.’ But commission members said today there were links, just not a working relationship and no evidence of any Iraqi involvement in September 11th.”   The Republican Chairman and Democratic Vice Chairman of the 9-11 Commission on Thursday rejected the media’s widespread reporting that the commission’s report issued the day before had directly contradicted Bush administration statements about connections between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Yet on Thursday night ABC’s Peter Jennings declared that there “continues to be a discrepancy between the commission’s findings and the President’s on whether al-Qaeda has a link to Saddam Hussein,” and CBS anchor Dan Rather repeated how “the commission yesterday said it had found no credible evidence of a quote, 'collaborative relationship’ between al-Qaeda and Iraq.” NBC’s Tom Brokaw reiterated the same no “collaborative relationship” finding. But, Brokaw intoned, “despite that conclusion, President Bush insisted there was a relationship between the two.” NBC buried what should have been its lead. At the very end of his report, David Gregory informed viewers of how “Lee Hamilton said today that he does not see much different between administration statements and the commission’s report.” CNN barely mentioned Hamilton while the New York Times and Washington Post ignored him.

       Another glaring example of the media distorting the truth to make Bush look bad.  Kevin   For an example of just how dishonest the partisan press prepared to be in its effort to discredit President Bush's wartime leadership, look at this passage from yesterday's USA Today:  Bush and Cheney also have sought to tie Iraq specifically to the 9/11 attacks. In a letter to Congress on March 19, 2003--the day the war in Iraq began--Bush said that the war was permitted under legislation authorizing force against those who ''planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.''  Here's what the letter, a prerequisite for the commencement of military action under the bipartisan Iraq war resolution, actually said:  Acting pursuant to the Constitution and Public Law 107-243 is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.  That is, the president's letter did not claim, as USA Today implies, that Iraq was culpable for the Sept. 11 attacks, only that Iraq's liberation was consistent with the effort to fight terrorists, including those who were behind 9/11.

       The Dems real Energy Policy.  What they don't tell you is that a new oil refinery has not been built in this country since 1976.  The other big driver is all the variations of gasoline, each state has legislated, causing difficulties in getting gas produced.  You can't sell gas made for CA in IL and on and on...  Kevin    Gas conspiracy       It's been exactly one month since Brian J. Kennedy, communications director for the House Resources Committee, suspected that the Democratic Party was nearing completion of a four-part strategy to obfuscate simple supply and demand principles and obstruct passage of President Bush's national energy policy.      "Here is how it works," he said.      •"Step One: Avoid directly addressing problem at all costs. If confronted on solutions, vote No."      •"Step Two: Bloviate about the evils of 'Big Oil' and SUVs (Yes, even though [senators and congressmen] drive one, are driven around in one, or have a private Gulfstream jet)."      •"Step Three: Call for investigations on price gouging, point fingers, and assign blame."      •"Step Four: Repeat steps one, two, and three until issue goes away (prices temporarily decline)."      The third step was completed the very day Mr. Kennedy issued his prophecy. Seven Democratic state attorneys general joined a Democratic senator in asking authorities to investigate whether oil and gas companies have colluded to drive up gasoline prices.      Now, Inside the Beltway has obtained "daily talking points" provided this week to Democratic congressmen, cheat sheets of sorts instructing them what to tell the public about gas prices. As Mr. Kennedy predicted, all 10 points call for probes of gas price gouging, blame the Bush administration for being "in the pocket" of big oil companies, and blame House Republicans for "doing their dirty work."      Sure enough, as gas prices drop nationwide this week, step four is complete.

       The media continues to only report about US abuses, not reporting on abuses by Sadaam.  By only reporting things that makes the US look bad, the media hope to sway international opinion and the election in November.  Kevin    The Saddam Torture Videos   The American Enterprise Institute held an unusual video screening yesterday, and hardly anyone showed up. One who did was the New York Post's Deborah Orin:  The video only lasts four minutes or so--gruesome scenes of torture from the days when Saddam Hussein's thugs ruled Abu Ghraib prison. I couldn't bear to watch, so I walked out until it was over.  Some who stayed wished they hadn't. They told of savage scenes of decapitation, fingers chopped off one by one, tongues hacked out with a razor blade--all while victims shriek in pain and the thugs chant Saddam's praises.  Saddam's henchmen took the videos as newsreels to document their deeds in honor of their leader.   But these awful images didn't show up on American TV news.   In fact, just four or five reporters showed up for the screening at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, which says it got the video via the Pentagon. Fewer wrote about it.  We saw part of this video a few weeks back, and indeed it is every bit as horrific as Orin's fellow reporters describe. Our computer crashed about a third of the way through and we didn't have the stomach to start watching again after rebooting. So we can certainly understand why television news outlets would see it as unfit to air.   As Orin notes, this "raises a very complex problem in the War on Terror. It's worse than creating moral equivalence between Saddam's tortures and prisoner abuse by U.S. troops. It's that we do far more to highlight our own wrongdoings precisely because they are less appalling."   As of yesterday, the New York Times had written 177 stories on Abu Ghraib — with over 40 on the front page. The self-proclaimed "paper of record" hadn't written a single story about those seven Iraqi men who had their hands chopped off by Sadaam.    Part of the problem may be that the press hasn't quite figured out how to deal with such "asymmetric propaganda," as Orin calls it. Yet it doesn't seem that it would be that hard to provide context--to make sure that every story about American abuses at Abu Ghraib also included graphic descriptions of what went on there before Iraq's liberation.  Why does the press harp on American abuses and ignore Saddam's? Orin quotes AEI's Michael Ledeen as saying it's because most journalists "want Bush to lose." Reporters, of course, are at pains to maintain an air of fairness, but surveys have demonstrated that most lean to the left.  If you listen to prominent Democrats like Ted Kennedy, Robert Byrd and Al Gore, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that they'd rather see America lose the war than the president win re-election. It's bad enough that one party is willing to engage in what as a practical matter amounts to anti-American propaganda. Surely we have a right to demand better from the news media.

       Here's another story the "Mainstream Media" is ignoring.  Kerry has missed almost every vote this year and most last year.  According to the law, he is supposed to give up salary for each day he misses.  Not to mention, at the prodding of the media, Bob Dole stepped down from the senate, in June of 1996, when he ran for president.  Apparently, the media doesn't hold Kerry to the same standard.  Kevin    Kerry's absences      A Hofstra University Law School student wants to see Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry return most of his Senate salary for the past two years to cover the days he has been absent campaigning.      Law student Johnathan M. Stein, 28, filed a complaint against Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts for cashing the pay checks and Senate Secretary Emily J. Reynolds for not deducting pay for his absences.      "I learned about the issue by accident," Mr. Stein said.      "Mrs. Reynolds has knowingly and willfully" violated section 2 paragraph 39 of the U.S. Code by giving Mr. Kerry his salary without deducting daily wages for each day that he has been absent from the Senate, Mr. Stein said.      Mr. Kerry began his day in New Jersey facing questions from reporters about Massachusetts Republican Gov. Mitt Romney's request that the senator resign his seat so the governor could appoint someone with the time to fill it.      "It's not fair, it's not right, and the public is not being well-served," said Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey.      She said Mr. Kerry has missed 64 percent of roll call votes last year and 87 percent this year.      Mr. Kerry refused to resign, saying: "I believe I am serving the citizens of Massachusetts and the country in the proposal I've laid out about health care for all Americans, which George Bush has not, to balance the budget, to be fiscally responsible."

       According to a Drudge, a report on Roll CAll yesterday, showed that the LA Times poll did in fact use 13% more Dems in their poll than Reps.  (Roll Call is a pay site so I couldn't read the article.)  The Wash Times picked up the below story when Bush's pollster called the poll bogus.  The "mainstream Media" will stop at nothing to try to sway opinion in the election.  Kevin   Matthew Dowd, who does the polling for President Bush's campaign, called last week's Los Angeles Times poll, which showed John Kerry leading the president 51 percent to 44 percent, a "mess."      In an e-mail to NBC and ABC, Mr. Dowd said that "Bush is leading independents by three, ahead among Republicans by a larger margin than Kerry is ahead among Dems, and we are down by seven. Outrageous. And it gets worse. They have Dems leading generic congressional ballot by 19. This means this poll is too Democratic by 10 to 12 points."      Mickey Kaus, in his Kausfiles column at slate.msn.com, writes, "Who's right? Ask Governor Gray Davis! OK, that's a cheap shot. But LAT-watchers have been skeptical of the Times Poll ever since it alone showed Davis closing to a virtual dead heat in the recent California gubernatorial recall -- a report that virtually everyone else (including rival campaigns and the rival Field Poll) scoffed at" in the run-up to the recall of Mr. Davis and the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor.

       Comparing the Clinton (Best Economy Ever) and Bush (worst Economy since Great Depression)  Oh wait...the numbers are better under Bush  Kevin :-)  Apparently, the Kerry camp has rolled out former Clinton economic advisor Gene Sperling to tell selected reporters how bad the economy is going. The only problem is, it's doing better than it was when his old boss was reelected in 1996.  Average monthly payroll growth Jan-May of the election year: Clinton in 1996: 233k/month Bush in 2004: 238k/month  Broadest measure of unemployment (U6) Average Jan-May: Clinton in 1996 = 9.8% Bush in 2004 = 9.7%  Number of manufacturing jobs created Jan-May: Clinton in 1996 = -9k* Bush in 2004 = 81k  * Note: over the final two years of President Clinton’s first term, the economy created just 67k net new manufacturing jobs.   Back in 1996, Sperling told the New York Times, "If they want to go head to head on the economic record, let's rock and roll."     New York Times Highlights Criticism of Economy by Sourcing 4 Dems and 2 Reps - Guess thats their view of Fair & Balanced    Take a look at who is quoted or cited as sources in the New York Times article about Kerry's attacks on the economy, and how voters agree more with his negative assessment than with the Bush team's focus on recent big growth: John Kerry; officials with the Democratic challenger's campaign; Gene Sperling;, economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and is now advising Kerry; Bush spokesman Steve Schmidt; Kerry again; Mark Mellman, the Kerry campaign's pollster; Kerry campaign officials; Kerry advisers; Mary Beth Cahill, Kerry's campaign manager; Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Kerry campaign; Sperling again, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans.  I guess Schmidt and Evans should just be glad there was any room in the story left for them, amongst all the "we're right where we want to be" lines from the Kerry folks.

       From the Wall Street Journal yeaterday on how the media refers to the economy.  Too funny !!!  Kevin    Signs of progress       "Here's a quick primer on how to track an economic recovery: When the media fret that the U.S. is heading for a decade of stagnation like Japan, that means profits and investment are picking up. When you hear that profits have risen but we're stuck in a 'jobless recovery,' businesses have started hiring. And finally when the cry goes up that American workers can find only low-paying menial jobs, that's the tip-off that the economy is booming," the Wall Street Journal says.      "Congratulations, America, the return of 'McJobs' rhetoric signifies that an expansion is in full swing," the newspaper said yesterday in an editorial.

       Sadly, once again, CBS proves it is nothing more than the media arm of the Democrat party.  This Sunday they will have a full hour on 60 Minutes with Clinton, as they did with Hillary, when her book came out and several double segments to anti-Bush authors.  They never even interview authors who write anti Dem books or write about media bias, those books are ignored by CBS and the rest of the media.  And now, they have ordered all their radio stations to carry a 60 minute propaganda/book promotion session on Thursday.  But, hey, they don't have an agenda !!!  Kevin :-)   CBS RADIO HEAD ORDERS 'MUST CARRY' TO STATIONS FOR CLINTON BOOK SPECIAL   **Exclusive**  Move over Rush Limbaugh!   Bill Clinton is set to hit the talkradio waves with a live special promoting his new book -- one that CBS has ordered a "must carry" directive for all of its news affiliates, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned.  Each and every one of CBS's news and talk stations will be required to take the Clinton book radio special, now scheduled for next 6 PM ET Thursday -- whether local programming management wants it or not!  "It's going to be like one big commercial for the book! Why didn't Mr. Clinton's publisher just buy an hour," one angry executive for a CBS news station said late Monday. "This is not news, this is marketing. I already feel dirty!"  Other CBS radio excutives are excited about Clinton finally appearing on live talkradio.  "I can't wait for the callers," said one CBS radio suit.   The one hour session titled "CLINTON CONNECTS WITH AMERICA" will be moderated by CBS EARLY SHOW host Harry Smith.  The program appears to be part of a larger cross-promotion platform package with Clinton and CBS parent VIACOM.   The former president is set to sit with CBS's Dan Rather at the Clinton library in Arkansas for Sunday's CBS 60 MINUTES.

       Another story the "Mainstream Media" is ignoring.  For all of those who said Bush lied...even though every other country with an intelligence agency said he had WMDs and all the Dems agreed when Clinton was in office.  Click on the title to read the whole article.     Friday, June 11, 2004 The United Nations has determined that Saddam Hussein shipped weapons of mass destruction components as well as medium-range ballistic missiles before, during and after the U.S.-led war against Iraq in 2003.  The UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission briefed the Security Council on new findings that could help trace the whereabouts of Saddam's missile and WMD program.  The briefing contained satellite photographs that demonstrated the speed with which Saddam dismantled his missile and WMD sites before and during the war. Council members were shown photographs of a ballistic missile site outside Baghdad in May 2003, and then saw a satellite image of the same location in February 2004, in which facilities had disappeared.

       According to a poll, abuzz in the media this week, Kerry pulled ahead of Bush by 7 points !  Hmmm...let's look at the numbers.  Bush leads in Independants by 3 points and leads in Republicans, by a greater margin than Kerry leads in Democrats.  The country is approx 40% Rep/Dem and 20% Independant.  If that was the case in the poll, Bush would be ahead as shown below.  Sorry for the allignment problems...you can't paste charts into these boxes.    If poll used make up of the country Bush would lead 50% to 46%:  	     Dem	 Ind	     Rep		 	40.00%	20.00%	40.00%	Totals	 Total	468	234	468	1,169	100.00% Bush	37	115	430	582	49.80% Kerry	416	108	14	538	46.00%   Actual poll results:  	All	Dem	Ind	Rep Bush	44.0%	8.0%	49.0%	92.0% Kerry	51.0%	89.0%	46.0%	3.0%    To get the numbers they came up with:  	Dem	Ind	Rep		 	48.75%	15.50%	35.75%	Totals	 Total	570	181	418	1,169	100.00% Bush	46	89	384	519	44.39% Kerry	507	83	13	603	51.59%   To get their percentages for Bush and Kerry, using the pattern of how each group voted, they would have to have almost 49% Dems, 15.5% Ind and only 36% Reps.  So, they grossly over represented the Dems in the poll.  Its no wonder that their poll showed Kerry out front !!!

       Interesting...how can it be that, when the economy has created 1.2 million jobs in the last 6 months, 57% of Americans think we have lost jobs over that time?  Could it be that the "Mainstream Media" refuses to report the good news?  Could it be that they only want to report bad news, prior to the election?  I report...you decide !  Kevin   An Associated Press survey of 788 registered voters conducted Monday through Wednesday shows that while they may be gaining confidence in the economy and Bush's performance, 57 percent said the nation has lost jobs in the last six months. The Labor Department has reported just the opposite -- nearly 1.2 million jobs gained in half a year.

       Poor Dan, Tom and Peter...they are upset because for a few days they couldn't rant 24/7 about how bad things are going in Iraq.  These guys make me sick.  According to polls, over 65% of Americans think the news on Iraq is too negative and the prison stories were over reported.  Not so says Dan, Tom and Peter !!!  They are mad that the Reagan coverage is pushing time away from them obsessing with Iraq stories.  Just shows how out of touch with america they are !!!!!  Kevin   June 9, 2004 -- DAN Rather and Tom Brokaw work for dif ferent networks but agree one thing — coverage of Ronald Reagan's death has been excessive, they say.  "Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president, life does go on," Rather told the Philadelphia Inquirer.   "There is other news, like the reality of Iraq," said the "CBS Evening News" anchor. "It got very short shrift this weekend."   Networks have been going almost wall-to-wall with coverage since Reagan passed away Saturday at the age of 93. The former president was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease nearly 10 years ago.   "Once the herd starts moving in one direction, it's very hard to turn it, even slightly," Rather said. "Nationally, the herd has grown tremendously."   "I think just about everything is over-covered these days," said Brokaw, who anchors the "NBC Nightly News." "The spectrum is so crowded. With all the cable networks, it begins to have a 'video wall' feeling to it."   Jennings said he had mixed feelings about the Reagan coverage.    "I'm more inclined to spare coverage — come on [the air], do something meaningful, then get away," he said.   "The last time I had to do it was with O.J. Simpson [during the 1994 car chase], and I had nothing to say after a certain period of time."   Coverage of Reagan's death will continue through Friday's funeral on all the news networks (broadcast and cable). — Post TV Staff

       From Opinion Journal Online.  The "Mainstream Media" continues to ignore members of the new Iraq government thanking the US and its coalition for liberating their country.  Kevin :-)   Iraqi Gratitude The new government is thanking America and Bush. Why are the media silent?  Tuesday, June 8, 2004 12:01 a.m.  A myth has developed that Iraqis aren't grateful for their liberation from Saddam. So it's worth noting that the leaders of Iraq's new interim government have been explicit and gracious in their thanks, not that you've heard this from the U.S. media. First in Arabic and then in English, Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said in his inaugural address to the Iraqi people last Tuesday that "I would like to record our profound gratitude and appreciation to the U.S.-led international coalition, which has made great sacrifices for the liberation of Iraq." In his own remarks, President Ghazi al-Yawer said: "Before I end my speech, I would like us to remember our martyrs who fell in defense of freedom and honor, as well as our friends who fell in the battle for the liberation of Iraq."   Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told the U.N. Security Council much the same thing last Thursday: "We Iraqis are grateful to the coalition who helped liberate us from the persecution of Saddam Hussein's regime. We thank President Bush and Prime Minister Blair for their dedication and commitment."  We thought our readers might like to know.

      BAD APPLES Give some Democrats credit: many of the comments released by party factotums on the death of President Ronald Reagan at least attempted to be gracious. But, while some of the words may have been magnanimous, the actions of some Democrats was not.  In California, according to a Democratic House leadership staffer, Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi's office refused until late in the day West Coast time to prepare any remarks by the leader on the passing of the President.  "A call went out around mid-day on the East Coast that Reagan might be in serious condition, and that party leaders should be ready. But Pelosi's people basically said they couldn't' be bothered. [Democratic whip] Steny Hoyer had to get them in line. We got the impression they just didn't want to say anything that would be construed as supportive of a Republican."  Pelosi's office also nixed sending flowers to the funeral home where the president's body was being prepared for burial.  Back in Washington, staffers at the Democratic National Committee stopped a couple of interns who were lowering the flags to half mast outside their headquarters.  "The interns were just doing what they thought was right," says a DNC staffer, who heard about the incident. "But somebody a bit more senior told them not to lower the flags until they absolutely had to, I guess when President Bush announced that all flags should be lowered. There was only an hour's difference. It was pretty petty, but that's how bad things have gotten around here."

       A perfect example of the trash the Dems are worried about offending.  They don't even have the decency to respect the dead and then cheer when this idiot says he wished Bush had died.  I say "screw the Eurotrash scum" !  Let them defend themselves for once...oh yeah, they can't.  If it wasn't for us, they would all be speaking German right now.  Kevin  :-)  'Bush should have died, not Reagan': Morrissey MANCHESTER music legend Morrissey sparked controversy when he announced Ronald Reagan's death live on stage during a concert - and then declared he wished it was George Bush who had died instead.  Thousands of fans at Dublin Castle, in Ireland, cheered when the ex-Smiths frontman made the announcement that the former American president, who had battled with Alzheimer's Disease, had passed away.  And an even bigger cheer followed when Morrissey - who is no stranger to controversy - then said he wished it had been the current President, George W Bush, who had died.  Fan Tony Murray said: "He commented about the death of Ronald Reagan and when he wished that it was George W instead the crowd went wild."  A spokesman for Morrissey's record label, Sanctuary Records, said: "We do not have a recording of the gig, but as far as we can tell, Morrissey was just alerting the audience to the fact that Ronald Reagan had died.  "He then simply followed that up with his comment about George Bush, which was his own opinion. He is no stranger to controversy."

       Even when writing a memorial to one of our greatest presidents, the NY Times can't help but take a few pot shots at him and the current president...see bolded sections.  Kevin   Ronald Reagan, who died on Saturday after his long battle with Alzheimer's disease, projected an aura of optimism so radiant that it seemed almost a force of nature. Many people who disagreed with his ideology still liked him for his personality, and that was a source of frustration for his political opponents who knew how much the ideology mattered. Looking back now, we can trace some of the  flaws of the current Washington mindset — the tax-cut-driven deficits, the slogan-driven foreign policy  — to Mr. Reagan's example. But after more than a decade of political mean-spiritedness, we have to admit that collegiality and good manners are beginning to look pretty attractive.  President Reagan was, of course, far more than some kind of chief executive turned national greeter. He will almost certainly be ranked among the most important presidents of the 20th century, forever linked with the triumph over Communism abroad and the restoration of faith in free markets at home.    He profited from good timing and good luck , coming along when the country was tired of the dour pedantry of the Carter administration, wounded by the Iranian hostage crisis, frustrated by rising unemployment and unyielding inflation. Mr. Reagan's stubborn refusal to accept the permanence of Communism helped end the cold war. He was fortunate to have as his counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev, a Soviet leader ready to acknowledge his society's failings and interested in reducing international tensions.   Mr. Reagan's decision to send marines to Lebanon was disastrous , however, and  his invasion of Grenada pure melodrama. His most reckless episode involved the scheme to supply weapons to Iran as ransom for Americans who were being held hostage in Lebanon , and to  use the proceeds to illegally finance contra insurgents in Nicaragua.   Mr. Reagan showed little appetite for power, even less for the messy detail of politics. He joked about his work habits. "It's true hard work never killed anybody," he said in 1987. "But I figure, why take the chance?" His detachment from the day-to-day business of government was seductive for a nation that had tired of watching Mr. Carter micromanage the White House.   The nation's 40th president was absent from the public eye for a long time before his death, but his complicated legacy endures. Although  Mr. Reagan did reverse course and approve some tax increases in the face of mounting deficits — in stark contrast to President Bush nowadays  — he was still responsible for turning the Republican Party away from its fiscally conservative roots.  The flawed theory behind the Reagan tax cuts , that the ensuing jolt to the economy would bring in enough money to balance the budget,  is still espoused by many of the Republican faithful, including President Bush.  One of Mr. Reagan's advisers, David Stockman, later wrote that the real aim of fiscal policy was to create a "strategic deficit" that would slam the door and reduce the size of the federal government. Such thinking is far too prevalent in Washington to this day, and helps  explain why plenty of conservatives don't seem all that bothered by the government's inability to balance its books.   When Ronald Reagan was elected, the institution of the presidency and the nation itself seemed to be laboring under a large dark cloud. Into the middle of this malaise came a most improbable chief executive — a former baseball announcer, pitchman for General Electric, Hollywood bon vivant and two-term California governor with one uncomplicated message: There was no problem that could not be solved if Americans would only believe in themselves. At the time, it was something the nation needed to hear.  Today, we live in an era defined by that particular kind of simplicity, which expresses itself in semi-detached leadership and a black-and-white view of the world . Gray is beginning to look a lot more attractive.

      Who says Bush lied???  "We conclude that, on the basis of the intelligence assessments at the time, covering both Niger and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the statements on Iraqi attempts to buy uranium from Africa in the Government's dossier, and by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, were well-founded. By extension, we conclude also that the statement in President Bush's State of the Union Address of 28 January 2003 that 'The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa' was well-founded." -- From "  Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction" chaired by Lord Butler, published yesterday by the British House of Commons

      Journalists 'Embarrassed' Bushies Cover Kerry Better Than They Do  When John Flip-Flop Kerry boasted to a group of fat-cat supporters in Boston that he and running mate John Edwards were  urlLink "proud" they had voted against funding the troops  they had voted to send to Iraq, you weren't supposed to hear that. Had it been up to the media establishment, you wouldn't have heard that.  So, why did you hear it? You can thank President Bush's re-election campaign.  The pro-Kerry New York Times fretted today that, taking a cue from "Bill Clinton's pioneering effort in 1992," the president's "operatives had somehow arranged for their own audio feed, they refused to say how, and were listening intently, ready to pounce on any opening for attack."   After the Bushies alerted the media to Kerry's latest gaffe, even the likes of the Washington Post, Boston Globe and the Times itself had to report the news or risk being upstaged by rivals.   Exposed and Humiliated   "Several journalists who cover Mr. Kerry later said they were too embarrassed to say publicly that it took the Bush operatives to spot what was notable in Mr. Kerry's remarks," the Times noted.  Don't worry, "operatives" of Big Media. The Republicans will keep helping you do the job you're too biased or lazy to do yourselves.

      This is classic...  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic candidate John Kerry ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ), whose campaign demanded to know on Wednesday whether President Bush ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) read a key Iraq ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) intelligence assessment, did not read the document himself before voting to give Bush the authority to go to war, aides acknowledged.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  "Along with other senators, he was briefed on the contents of the NIE (National Intelligence Estimate) by (then-CIA ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) Director) George Tenet and other administration intelligence officials," said Kerry spokesman Phil Singer.   Kerry's campaign has challenged Bush to say whether he read the complete intelligence report before deciding to go to war, or whether he just read a one-page summary, which Democrats say gave him none of the dissenting views included in the full version.   The Kerry campaign stepped up the attack on Wednesday, sending out an e-mail with the headline, "Did anyone in the White House read the full National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq?"   In a conference call organized by the campaign, Senate Intelligence Committee Democrat Richard Durbin said Bush should have read the 90-page report issued in October 2002.   Asked if Kerry read it, Durbin responded, "I don't know."

      "Mr. Speaker, leave it to the former head of the KGB to inject a little common sense into the American presidential race — and leave it to the partisan American media to ignore it," Rep. Joe Wilson, South Carolina Republican, said yesterday on the House floor.  "During the recent [Group of Eight] summit in Georgia, Russian President Vladimir Putin said to a gathering of the news media — and I quote — 'I am deeply convinced that President Bush's political adversaries have no moral right to attack him over Iraq.'  "I did not find this quote in the New York Times or The Washington Post because they refused to report it. I didn't find it broadcast on CBS or NBC or ABC News either. I found this quote in China Daily, straight from Beijing," the congressman said.  "You could have found the same quote in some Russian publications as well, including Pravda and the British-based Reuters news service. But you could not find that quote in the American media except for one outlet — CBN.  "It's a sorry day for American journalism when they find themselves out-balanced by their counterparts in communist China and Russia. It's also a new low for partisan media bias."

      Recognition of the obvious. The media “wants Kerry to win” and so “they’re going to portray Kerry and Edwards as being young and dynamic and optimistic” and “there’s going to be this glow about” them, Evan Thomas, the Assistant Managing Editor of Newsweek, admitted on Inside Washington over the weekend. He should know. His magazine this week sports a smiling Kerry and Edwards on its cover with the yearning headline, “The Sunshine Boys?” Inside, an article carrying Thomas’ byline contrasted how “Dick Cheney projects the bleakness of a Wyoming winter, while John Edwards always appears to be strolling in the Carolina sunshine.” The cover story touted how Kerry and Edwards “became a buddy-buddy act, hugging and whispering like Starsky and Hutch after consuming the evidence.”        Newsweek’s competitor, Time, also gushed about the Democratic ticket, dubbing them, in the headline over their story, “The Gleam Team.”            The Washington Post on Sunday well illustrated the media’s infatuation with Kerry and Edwards. “Kerry Vows to Restore 'Truth' to Presidency,” announced a July 11 front page headline. Inside, on page A-8, a headline declared: “Kerry, Edwards Revel in Brotherhood of Campaign.” The subhead: “Energy, Enthusiasm Infectious as Democrats Take Message to Battleground States.”             On Inside Washington, a weekend discussion show taped at and run by the Gannett-owned CBS affiliate in Washington, DC, WUSA-TV, and carried by many PBS stations across the country, Thomas pointed out the boost to the Kerry/Edwards ticket provided by the press corps:        “There’s one other base here: the media. Let’s talk a little media bias here. The media, I think, wants Kerry to win. And I think they’re going to portray Kerry and Edwards -- I’m talking about the establishment media, not Fox, but -- they’re going to portray Kerry and Edwards as being young and dynamic and optimistic and all, there’s going to be this glow about them that some, is going to be worth, collectively, the two of them, that’s going to be worth maybe 15 points.”        The week’s Newsweek, dated July 19, certainly backs up Thomas’ contention. Over a smiling picture on the cover of Kerry and Edwards, Newsweek ever hopefully asks: “The Sunshine Boys?”        Inside, at least in the Web-posted version, the headline reads: “Warming Up Kerry.” The subhead: “Blue skies: Their energy was infectious, but their numbers barely moved. Can Kerry-Edwards convert smiles into votes against Team Bush? Game on.” Howard Fineman and Richard Wolffe asserted at one point:        “Indeed, Edwards's ingratiating incandescence has already brightened Kerry. The two became a buddy-buddy act, hugging and whispering like Starsky and Hutch after consuming the evidence.”            “The Boyish Wonder” is the headline over a story on which Thomas shared a byline with Susannah Meadows and Arian Campo-Flores. The subhead: “Happy warrior: He was no superstar. But John Edwards's determination and ability to read the defense took him to the top.” The trio began the laudatory piece:        “In politics, self-made men seem to fall into two categories: sunny and dark. Both Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon began as farm boys, but while Ike radiated corn-fed smiles, Nixon seemed to be constantly brooding over some slight. In the 2004 election, Dick Cheney projects the bleakness of a Wyoming winter, while John Edwards always appears to be strolling in the Carolina sunshine...”

       The AP continues to put negative spins on their polls.  Of all the items in the below poll, they choose Arrogant as the headline where Bush and Kerry are within the magrin of error.  52% of voters say Bush is arrogant...barely over half and they choose to run that as their headline !  Since more people say Bush is wealthy versus Kerry I worry about where these people get their info.  Bush is worth about $15M and Kerry around a BILLION.  I would say that Kerry is the wealthy one.   The Associated Press has a new poll that lists seven adjectives and asks if they describe George W. Bush and John Kerry  "Decisive": Bush 67%, Kerry 45% (Bush by 22%) "Arrogant": Bush 52%, Kerry 44% (Bush by 8%) "Wealthy": Bush 90%, Kerry 85% (Bush by 5%) "Likeable": Bush 66%, Kerry 62% (Bush by 4%) "Honest": Bush 53%, Kerry 53% (even) "Compassionate": Bush 59%, Kerry 60% (Kerry by 1%) "Intelligent": Bush 63%, Kerry 83% (Kerry by 20%)   The poll also asked, "Who makes you feel more optimistic about America's future?" Fifty percent said Bush, 44% Kerry, 1% both and 4% neither.   So what headline did the AP put on its dispatch about the poll? "More Voters See Bush as Arrogant."   The wire service did change its headline on a later version of the story: "Bush Seen Decisive, Kerry Smart."

       While the Liberal Dynamic Duo rails against Benedict Arnold CEOs and other "rich" who don't pay their fair share, it appears that Edwards has been very successful in dogding paying his fair share.  Don't hold your breath for the media to report this one.  We alos don't know about the Kerry/Heinz taxes since she won't release her tax returns.  Imagine the uproar if the media discovered Bush pulled this dodge?  Kevin   Senator Edwards talks about the need to provide health care for all, but that didn't stop him from using a clever tax dodge to avoid paying $591,000 into the Medicare system. While making his fortune as a trial lawyer in 1995, he formed what is known as a "subchapter S" corporation, with himself as the sole shareholder.  Instead of taking his $26.9 million in earnings directly in the following four years, he paid himself a salary of $360,000 a year and took the rest as corporate dividends. Since salary is subject to 2.9% Medicare tax but dividends aren't, that meant he shielded more than 90% of his income. That's not necessarily illegal, but dodging such a large chunk of employment tax skates perilously close to the line.

The report says it was indeed Wilson's wife that recommended him for the job and his assertion that Bush lied, because he knew the documents were forged, was a lie because the forged docs didn't turn up until 8 months after Wilson's report.  The report also says the CIA did not brief Bush or Cheney on the Wilson trip.  Will the media apologize for all the stories about how Bush tried to kill his wife?  Don't hold your breath since they haven't even bothered to report on the findings !!!  Kevin   Former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, dispatched by the CIA in February 2002 to investigate reports that Iraq sought to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program with uranium from Africa, was specifically recommended for the mission by his wife, a CIA employee, contrary to what he has said publicly.  Wilson last year launched a public firestorm with his accusations that the administration had manipulated intelligence to build a case for war. He has said that his trip to Niger should have laid to rest any notion that Iraq sought uranium there and has said his findings were ignored by the White House.  Wilson's assertions -- both about what he found in Niger and what the Bush administration did with the information -- were undermined yesterday in a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report.  The panel found that Wilson's report, rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to Iraq, as he has said, bolstered the case for most intelligence analysts. And contrary to Wilson's assertions and even the government's previous statements, the CIA did not tell the White House it had qualms about the reliability of the Africa intelligence that made its way into 16 fateful words in President Bush's January 2003 State of the Union address.  The report turns a harsh spotlight on what Wilson has said about his role in gathering prewar intelligence, most pointedly by asserting that his wife, CIA employee Valerie Plame, recommended him.  Plame's role could be significant in an ongoing investigation into whether a crime was committed when her name and employment were disclosed to reporters last summer.  The report may bolster the rationale that administration officials provided the information not to intentionally expose an undercover CIA employee, but to call into question Wilson's bona fides as an investigator into trafficking of weapons of mass destruction. To charge anyone with a crime, prosecutors need evidence that exposure of a covert officer was intentional.  The report states that a CIA official told the Senate committee that Plame "offered up" Wilson's name for the Niger trip, then on Feb. 12, 2002, sent a memo to a deputy chief in the CIA's Directorate of Operations saying her husband "has good relations with both the PM [prime minister] and the former Minister of Mines (not to mention lots of French contacts), both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity." The next day, the operations official cabled an overseas officer seeking concurrence with the idea of sending Wilson, the report said.  Wilson has asserted that his wife was not involved in the decision to send him to Niger.  "Valerie had nothing to do with the matter," Wilson wrote in a memoir published this year. "She definitely had not proposed that I make the trip."  The report said Plame told committee staffers that she relayed the CIA's request to her husband, saying, "there's this crazy report" about a purported deal for Niger to sell uranium to Iraq. The committee found Wilson had made an earlier trip to Niger in 1999 for the CIA, also at his wife's suggestion.  The report also said Wilson provided misleading information to The Washington Post last June. He said then that he concluded the Niger intelligence was based on documents that had clearly been forged because "the dates were wrong and the names were wrong."  "Committee staff asked how the former ambassador could have come to the conclusion that the 'dates were wrong and the names were wrong' when he had never seen the CIA reports and had no knowledge of what names and dates were in the reports," the Senate panel said. Wilson told the panel he may have been confused and may have "misspoken" to reporters. The documents -- purported sales agreements between Niger and Iraq -- were not in U.S. hands until eight months after Wilson made his trip to Niger.  Wilson spent a total of eight days in Niger "drinking sweet mint tea and meeting with dozens of people," as he put it. On the basis of this "investigation" he confidently concluded that there was no way Saddam sought uranium from Africa. Oddly, Wilson didn't bother to write a report saying this. Instead he gave an oral briefing to a CIA official.   "Because CIA analysts did not believe that the [Wilson] report added any new information to clarify the issue," the report states flatly on page 46, "they did not use the report to produce any further analytical products or highlight the report for policymakers. CIA's briefer did not brief the vice president on the report, despite the vice president's previous questions about the issue."

       More on how France and Russia profited by the Oil for Food program and their motives for opposing the enforcing of the UN resolutions.  Kevin   WASHINGTON — Transcripts of secret U.N. Security Council sessions show that U.S. and British diplomats were constantly thwarted by their French, Russian and Chinese counterparts while investigating Saddam Hussein's dirty deals under the oil-for-food program.   Minutes of meetings of the so-called 661 Committee — the U.N. Security Council panel that oversaw Iraq sanctions and the oil-for-food program — have been recently turned over to U.S. congressional committees investigating the $10 billion bribery kickback scandal, officials said.   According to a top congressional investigator who has read the highly sensitive documents, the minutes confirm that there was widespread knowledge inside the United Nations years before the war that Saddam's regime was ripping off the $100 billion program by demanding kickbacks from oil traders and suppliers of humanitarian aid to Iraq.   The investigator said the transcripts reveal that U.S. and British diplomats repeatedly raised questions about suspicious contracts, but efforts to investigate corruption were blocked by Russia, France, China and, at times, Syria.   "The Russians and Chinese made clear their position was that they were against sanctions on Iraq and didn't like this program, so they were not going to help in any way," the investigator said.   "The French were two-faced about it. They would respond to American and British requests to halt contracts by saying there was not enough evidence, or more information was needed. In the end, the Americans and British were often forced to back down on these inquiries."   France and Russia were two of the biggest opponents of the U.S. war effort to oust Saddam, and Russian and French politicians and businessmen were the most numerous names published in the Baghdad newspaper al-Mada earlier this year of recipients of sweetheart oil deals from Saddam's regime.   Ihsan Karim, the Iraqi official heading the probe into alleged corruption, was killed last Thursday.

       So, Kerry thinks he can be a better president than Bush and protect us from terrorists, but doesn/t even take the time to get briefed on the threats.  He has the gall to say Bush is hyping the terror threat...maybe its because he has no clue since he hasn't bothered to take the briefings !  Kevin   KERRY PASSES UP TERROR BRIEFING: 'I JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME' Fri Jul 09 2004 09:23:56 ET  Just hours before attending an all-star celebrity fundraising concert in New York, Dem presidential candidate John Kerry revealed how he has been too busy for a real-time national security briefing.  "I just haven't had time," Kerry explained in an interview.  Kerry made the startling comments on CNN's LARRY KING LIVE Thursday night.  KING: News of the day, Tom Ridge warned today about al Qaeda plans of a large-scale attack on the United States. Didn't increase the -- you see any politics in this? What's your reaction?   KERRY: Well, I haven't been briefed yet, Larry. They have offered to brief me. I just haven't had time.

      So, the media is all up in a tizzy that Cheney dropped the F bomb on senator Leahy.  They can't believe how much the Republicans have destroyed civility in politics.  Guess calling Bush Hitler, a nazi, a miserable failure, a liar, a misleader, he went to war for oil, went to war for Haliburton, he is preying on our fears, he betrayed the country, he is trampling civil rights and on and on is a positive campaign.  I forgot, only Republicans can hurt civility, not Dems.  Back to Cheney.  The media and Dems are up in arms.  Funny, back when Kerry said, during an interview with Rolling Stone, "Bush F**ked up things in the Iraq war", everyone said he was showing his outrage, he was being hip, connecting with young voters.  The Wash Post didn't even mention the word...they said "Kerry used an expletive to describe Bush foreign policy".  When Cheney used the F word they spelled it out in the paper because they needed to "show the corsening of the debate".  Hmmm...double standard in coverage?  I certainly think so !    Per Cheney, it was something that needed to be said.  Leahy is one of the biggest A-Holes in politics.  The day before the F bomb, Leahy said "Men and women are dying in Iraq so that Cheney's Big Oil pals can benefit".  He then walks up to Cheney like they are old pals.  Maybe he should have thought how what he says corsens the debate.  Kevin

       A little perspective for the outcry about raising the minimum wage to save "working families".  Kevin   Sen. John Kerry's latest scheme to raise the quality of life for America's poor is to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7 an hour. Of the 1.5 percent of the workforce that earns the minimum wage or below (about 2.1 million people), more than half are under age 25. More than 500,000 of them are between the ages of 16 and 19, which means that they likely live with a parent or relative, are in school and work part-time for extra pocket change. Many of the rest of them are in entry-level or temporary jobs, which means they likely will get raises in the future. (Indeed, a study of minimum-wage earners revealed that 63 percent saw their wages increase over a year.) As the Wall Street Journal notes: "Three-fifths are in the leisure and hospitality industry, which means in jobs that often come with tips in addition to wages." Furthermore, unmarried workers are more likely to earn the minimum wage or less than their married counterparts. And finally, only 15 percent of those earning the minimum wage or below are lone earners with children.    (so, 315K people of the 2.1M have kids.  that's .1% of the total US population.  My question is, why do people making min wage decide to have kids in the first place?)     Still, Mr. Kerry insists, "I'm running for president to build a stronger economy that lifts up families and expands opportunity for hard-working Americans."       Instead of helping the poor, Mr. Kerry's minimum-wage increase, along with his other economic plans, would kick many of them out of the job market. Only John Kerry could view that as championing the poor.

       Like many other stories, the "mainstream media" ignored this story about Polish soldiers thwarting terrorists attempts to get Sarin Gas shells.  Must be because it goes against their hyping stories that the weapons never existed.  Kevin   About a dozen artillery shells found in Iraq by Polish troops are being checked for sarin after initial tests were positive for the nerve agent, U.S. officials said on Thursday.   Terrorists may have been close to obtaining munitions containing the deadly nerve agent cyclosarin that Polish soldiers recovered last month in Iraq, the head of Poland's military intelligence said Friday.  Polish troops had been searching for munitions as part of their regular mission in south-central Iraq when they were told by an informant in May that terrorists had made a bid to buy the chemical weapons, which date back to Saddam Hussein's war with Iran in the 1980s, Gen. Marek Dukaczewski told reporters in Warsaw. "We were mortified by the information that terrorists were looking for these warheads and offered $5,000 apiece," Dukaczewski said. "An attack with such weapons would be hard to imagine. All of our activity was accelerated at appropriating these warheads."  In May, a booby-trapped artillery shell apparently filled with the sarin nerve agent exploded alongside a Baghdad road but caused no serious injuries to the U.S. forces who discovered it. At the time, officials stopped short of claiming the munition was definite evidence of a large weapons stockpile in prewar Iraq or evidence of recent production by Saddam's regime.  The warheads all contained cyclosarin, said Polish Gen. Mieczyslaw Bieniek, commander of a multinational force.  "Laboratory tests showed the presence in them of cyclosarin, a very toxic gas, five times stronger than sarin and five times more durable," Bieniek told Poland's TVN24 at the force's Camp Babylon headquarters.  "If these warheads, which were still usable, were used on a military base like Camp Babylon, they would have caused unforeseeable damage."  The tests were done by U.S. experts, who were conducting more.  The munitions were found in a bunker in the Polish sector, but Polish officials refused to be more specific.

       Funny how the party that says every vote should count is always suing to not count votes that don't go for them.  Just like with disqualifying the military ballots in FL, the Dems sued to not allow Nader on the ballot in AZ.  Now Nader's camp folded because they have no resources to fight.  So much for counting every vote.  Kevin   PHOENIX (AP) -- Supporters of Ralph Nader on Friday abandoned their effort to get the independent candidate on the presidential ballot in Arizona after Democrats challenged the validity of thousands of signatures.  Nader's campaign had submitted more than 22,000 signatures to Arizona election officials June 9 -- far more than the 14,694 valid signatures required by state law to compete against President Bush and Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.  Two Democratic voters had filed a lawsuit last week, backed by the Arizona Democratic Party, questioning the validity of Nader's nominating petitions and other documents. The Democrats argued that more than 70 percent of the signatures were invalid.  As a judge prepared to hear arguments in the case, the campaign said a review by the secretary of state's office found that the campaign was about 550 signatures short of the number needed to get on the ballot.  ``We withdrew after elections officials came out with us being 550 signatures short,'' said Nader campaign spokesman Kevin Zeese. ``There's no question that deep-pocketed Democrats don't have much of a sense of fair play.''  He said the campaign does not have the resources to fight the aggressive legal challenge.

       Once again the Dems are trying to cheat to get illegal votes for the upcoming election.  Just like bribing homeless with cigarettes in WI, registering dead indians in SD, getting 102% of registered voters in Philly to vote, keeping the polling places open for hours after they close in non Dem strongholds, getting a different person on the ballot in NJ after the deadline, and on and on the Dems can't ever play by the rules when it comes to voting.  They know the only way they can win is to cheat.  Kevin   Liberal groups supporting Democratic Sen. John Kerry for president have been accused of fraud and of sending felons into people's homes in their efforts to register new voters in Missouri.      The massive drive -- concentrated in the heavily Democratic city of St. Louis -- has registered nearly 25,000 Missouri voters in an effort to take the battleground state from President Bush, who won it in 2000.      "They're going to people's doors, getting their Social Security numbers, birth dates and how many people live in the home," said Woody Cozad, former state Republican Party chairman and board member of the Center for Ethics and the Free Market, a nonprofit group that has raised questions about the voter drive. "That, by itself, could lead to all sorts of problems."      St. Louis election officials  rejected for a variety of reasons more than a quarter of the voter-registration forms  filed by America Coming Together (ACT) and other liberal groups committed to defeating Mr. Bush in November.          In the past year, the Missouri Secretary of State's office has provided ACT with 106,656 voter-registration cards. During that time, ACT and other groups have turned in 34,683 cards to the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners, of which 9,879 have been rejected for various reasons.      The majority were rejected as duplicating existing voter registrants, while others were rejected because the prospective voters were underage, had been convicted of felonies or couldn't be verified.      "In short, by inundating election authorities who are under significant legal and staffing constraints with such large numbers of non-verified applicants, the activities of these groups threatens to undermine the legitimacy of Missouri's electoral system," says the report issued by the Center for Ethics.      Under particular scrutiny are 16,000 voter-registration forms requested by Missouri Department of Corrections employees helping in the voter drive, Mr. Cozad said.

       Good news out of Iraq we never hear about.  Kevin  For the sake of American soldiers, a congressman is calling on news organizations to begin reporting the "other side of the story" in Iraq.     "It is one that demonstrates what can happen when people taste freedom," says Rep. Steve King, Iowa Republican, who has twice traveled to Iraq.     "And I can tell you firsthand that what is being reported by the mainstream media does not accurately reflect the day-to-day acts of goodwill toward the Iraqi people," he says. "I can tell you that what the troops told me did not sound remotely similar to the non-stop negative stories being promoted by the major media sources."     With Saddam Hussein no longer in power, the congressman cites more than 170 newspapers that are now being published in Iraq without restrictions on free speech. More than 3,700 schools have been renovated, he says, and more than 9 million new math and science textbooks printed and distributed "with the pro-Saddam propaganda extracted."     He calls attention to Iraq's new $1 billion healthcare budget — 25 times greater than the $16 million annual budget under Saddam's reign. Already, 85 percent of Iraqi children have been immunized.     "Why don't we hear any of this in the media?" Mr. King asks.

       Some reporters admit the bias in their reactions to the Kerry and Bush speeches was unacceptable.  Kevin   The historic Unity convention in Washington is over but what it is being remembered for, at least in some corners of the media, is not the huge turnout of more than 7,000, but controversy over the alleged partisanship shown by many of the attendees in responding to separate speeches by presidential candidates Bush and Kerry.Commentary on this issue continued over the weekend and into Monday.John Temple, editor of the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, praised the meeting overall and said he was "inspired" by it -- but noted in a column that the partisanship (evidenced by "cheering and whistling" during Kerry's speech) was "something I had never experienced in a crowd of journalists."Helen Ubinas, another attendee, wrote in The Hartford (Conn.) Courant that she was "in the minority, as it were" who acted like "a professional, not a partisan" in responding to Kerry. There was snickering during Bush's address and the crowd rose at the end, "but not for much longer than it took to head to the door." Ubinas' explanation: Kerry connects with the "advocacy side" of Unity journalists. But showing preference for one candidate, she added, "is the ultimate betrayal -- to everyone."Akilah Johnson, a reporter at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in Delray Beach, Fla., told USA Today, "It was a little awkward for me. I guess a lot of people were acting like citizens, not reporters." Unity President Ernest Sotomayer pointed out that many Unity members, including those who were covering the event or planned to report on it later, did not cheer. Those who did, he said, are "people who vote, and they have a right to express themselves" when they're not working. But Seattle Times reporter Florangelea Davila told her paper, "It was so offensive and awful, and I hated it. It was clearly inappropriate. It was ridiculous." Houston Chronicle Suburban Editor Pete McConnell said he was "embarrassed" by the crowd reactions to Bush and Kerry: "As a group we should have kept ourselves in check." Bob Steele, ethics expert at the Poynter Institute, called public outbursts favoring one candidate "unprofessional and unethical." Others pointed out that some of those cheering on Kerry were with his campaign or were attending the convention but were not journalists. And not all journalists at the Unity meeting work for the mainstream media. Some are employed by the alternative and advocacy press. Others are columnists who are paid to express their opinions.

       So, now we know that Jordan and Egypt both told us he definitely had WMDs...as well as most other countries, the UN and the Clinton Administration.  Who says Bush lied again???  Kevin   Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak personally assured Gen. Tommy Franks that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction within two months of the U.S.'s attack, the former Centcom Commander revealed on Tuesday. "The Jordanians have reliable intelligence and sources in Iraq that say, in fact, that Saddam Hussein has biological and chemical weapons," Franks said King Abdullah told him. The Jordanian king passed the WMD intelligence on to Franks during a face-to-face meeting in Jan. 2003. A warning from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was even stronger, Franks said. In his book "American Soldier," the ex-Centcom chief quotes Mubarak saying, "You've got to be very, very careful, general. We have spoken with Saddam Hussein. He is a madman. He has weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons. And he will use them against your troops." "A number of other leaders in the Mideast told us he had them, too," Franks told Hannity, adding, "If you were president of the United States, could you avoid paying attention to that?"
