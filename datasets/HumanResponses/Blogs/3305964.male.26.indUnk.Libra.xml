      I'm in the "let stand for one minute" stage of making lunch and this is the hardest part.  I'm have a President's Choice  urlLink Butter Chicken  Microwave Lunch of Excellence (or something like that).  I am no connoisseur but these things are the best microwave meals I've ever had.  I mentioned it's the hardest part because I have to sit here and smell the beautiful smells of tandoori goodness for a full 60 seconds before I can burn my mouth on the hot lunch  urlLink (snicker)  because I'm too impatient to wait or to even blow on it.  Of course, now I'm actually eating because it takes me longer than 60 sec to type the paragraph above and, for the record, I did pause at 60 and burn my mouth.  The weekend was good.  Went to  two  weddings on Saturday (two ceremonies and one reception).  Both were very nice but I'm sad we couldn't be at both receptions.  The second wedding (the reception we stayed for) was on a boat in the Toronto harbour where we toured around for about five hours.  I managed to get a good pic of the skyline at dusk and I'll try and post it here later.  I have a full week ahead of me... cutting parent's lawn, beer with best man, buying wedding bands, event planning meeting, (future) in-laws coming... somewhere in that mess I'm going to try to get back to the gym and start doing the school work that I haven't touched in a month and a half.  I think the almost three weeks I've been away from the gym are to blame for my lack of energy so I'm going to make that a priority for sure... we'll see how it goes.

      It's been a while since I've seen that much rain in one weekend.  We were at a friend's parent's place in the Kawartha's for Saturday and Sunday night, and we all stayed out in tents.  Problem number one - the fiance doesn't like sleeping in a tent.  Problem number two - the fiance doesn't like the cold  or  the wet.  We did get a break in the nastiness for about two hours on Sunday afternoon (long enough to sun burn my arms) but by dinner time the gods were mad at us again and took a piss all over our little camp site.    Almost everyone, including the fiance, left on Sunday.  My tent was nice and dry and I don't mind the cold so I decided to stick it out.  This was probably a big mistake.  Not because I didn't have a good time and not because I was cold and wet... In fact I was warm and dry and had a blast.  The problem is, and I guess I do this a lot, I chose my friends over the fiance.  This is a problem on a couple of levels... She doesn't like sleeping alone in the house. I should be choosing her over my friends at least some of the time (and probably most of the time... she is going to be my wife).  And, I think the biggest one, I chose  alcohol  over her (no one should ever choose alcohol over a person... unless that person is  urlLink Vin Diesel ).  Not that I really chose alcohol over her but that's how it looks.   The truth is I don't go camping anymore (see above about tents, wet and cold), I don't play Euchre unless I'm with the people who were there (the fiance doesn't like Euchre) and I look forward to spending the May 2-4 weekend with these people every year.  Sure, I like drinking, and probably did too much of it on Saturday night, but that's not why I stayed.  Also, I love the fiance very much and enjoy spending time with her, so that's not why I stayed.  I don't think the problem really is about the decision I made Sunday but more about the decision I make every time I'm out with my friends and the fiance wants to go home a little early... I'm going to do my best to be more understanding from now on.

      Been a few days since I've written.  The sickness hit me a little harder than usual.  My voice is still gone, my body aches all over and I feel light headed, almost drunk but not in a good way.  The long weekend is apon us... MAY 2-4!!!  I figure I have 20 hours to fight this shit off so I can go punish my body again.  Last year I came away with a broken foot and no memory of how I did it.  We pulled some CSI shit and figured I triped over some pipe or something in the ground but all I really know for sure is that it hurt like a son of a bitch.  Last year also brought us Beer-gammon.  This was a giant Back gammon board that I painstakingly drew on the ground and we used empty beer bottles as pieces.  The problem with that plan was that by the time I had finished drawing up the board I was too drunk to concentrate on the game.  But you should have seen how cool it looked.  This year looks like rain.  The cottage/summer home that we're going up to requires that the 30 or so of us that are going all sleep in tents.  I'm actually ok with this... just wear the right clothing and keep your wet stuff away from your dry and you'll be ok.  The Wife on the other hand is not the outdoorsy type.  Even if the weather was perfect she'd rather not be out in a tent... I guess we'll see how it goes.  I'll tell you about it later.

      Four crazy nights ago myself and ten friends left for Vegas.  This was a big four-way bachelor party for me and three others the idea being that the amount of money that we would spend at four stags would be about the same as an awesome weekend in the land of sin.  The other part was that it just seems that no one throws a good stag anymore.  I haven't been to many myself but I have found they are usually just an expensive dinner then off to the ripper's to get right drunk.  Don't get me wrong, that sounds like a great night out with the guys but it just doesn't sound different enough from something we might do anyway to really call it a stag.  The only real differences are everyone blows a lot more cash, the groom gets a ton of lap dances and everyone keeps quiet about what happened (as if the bride doesn't know anyway).  So, Vegas... This was my first trip to this adult playground and I guarantee it won't be my last.  Being as it was a bachelor party I can't discuss details but a few great quotes were    "Hey, that's my wife"  " urlLink "Right through your pants"   "Fuck the Bellagio"     A bunch of items on the "to do before I die" list were knocked off and I'll keep the list in a safe place until the next time I'm down there.  Now I'm sick (damn sore throat) so I'm going to grab a nap.  PS - Annu sorry about the phone ;)

      I submitted the last post ( urlLink Smooth criminal... ) by email and it has a ton of extra line breaks I can't remove.  Sorry.

      I picked up my passport this morning.  The picking up process was much nicer (read: shorter) than the application process.    The history - About a week ago, I went to apply at the local passport office at Yonge and Sheppard.  I had planned to be there right at 8am when they opened.  Anyone from the Toronto area would probably know what a mess the following are (a) west bound 401 traffic during rush, (b) the collector lanes near Yonge, and (c) Yonge, mostly anywhere but especially near Sheppard.  Well, after battling that travel, I made it there for 8:05am... not bad I thought.  Then I was given number 78 with the currently serving sitting at 3 or so... crap I thought.  The next hour plus of that visit was extremely uneventful except for the singing security guard that smiled at all the old ladies... they loved him.  Today - knowing the commute ahead I planned on leaving a bit early... then I sleep in.  I rushed out the door and somehow made it on time.  I was third in the pick up line and was back in my car in 10 min.  Much nicer, right?  Now I have an official Canadian document with a picture of what must be a terrorist that looks vaguely like me.  If you got this far you may be asking, "Why the passport?"... VEGAS, BABY. VEGAS.  I'll get to that later... right now I'm hungry.

      Well, here I am.  I've been thinking of setting up a blog for about a year and a half now hoping it would be therapeutical to just talk about the things in my life (even if no one is listening).  I guess we'll see how this works out.  If nothing else, maybe this will be a nice diary of my life to help with my less than perfect memory.  Myself, I don't read a lot of  personal  blogs (with the exception of  urlLink Wil  and  urlLink Jake .  In fact, it's mostly Wil's fault that I'm here typing this right now.  It seems to me that Wil has gained a lot, emotionally, through writing for his site and I hope I have even a tenth of experience with writing as Wil has had.  One last thing.  I know there are many magnitudes more bad writers with blogs than good writers with blogs and I fully suspect that I will fall squarely in the former camp.  If you do not like my writing or are somehow offended by the subject matter, please leave.  Please do not flame me for por speling (sic) or bad sentence structure or the occasional rambling thought.  Thanks.

      I really don't have much experience with Apple machines but I do dream of owning a  urlLink PowerBook  before my days breathing oxygen are done.  The reason?  It's things like  urlLink this

      I finally logged into my gmail account and, what do we have here, six invites!  I sent out an email to friends and family and I have never had so many replies so quickly.    Now that I have some emails in the inbox I'm really starting to like this Gmail stuff.  The conversations are taking a little getting used to but they are something I've tried to set up in Outlook before so I understand the concept.  It reminds me of something  urlLink IBM talked about  awhile ago.

      So I got my  urlLink gmail address  and I have not even been able to use it.  Over the last 5 days I wasn't able to log in and when I finally got in today I couldn't read my messages.  I know this is beta so I'm not holding it against them but I just really want to see how everything works, and I can't, so I'm bummed.  Anyone who wants to come to a rawking Stag n' Doe on July 10th (drinking/dancing/food and prizes) try the  urlLink gmail address  and hopefully I'll be able to read it.

      Not much new but I thought I should write anyway.  I received my  urlLink free copy of VB.NET  from Microsoft today... Hopefully I'll have time to play this weekend.  I may get some hate mail for this (and maybe some fan mail from LISP devs or something) but from what I've seen VB is programming for dummies.  Draw a box, pick a command from a drop down list, yadda-yadda-yadda and boo yah, a working program.  Speaking of Hate/Fan mail... That can now be sent to dave.mcgee@gmail.com.  I got an invite from a very nice person from the MozillaZine Forums.  Speaking of MozillaZine... I downloaded the new  urlLink Firefox 0.9 .  I used to be a nightly freak and would download a new copy every morning (all the way back to Phoenix).  After a few bad builds I just started reading about the new builds everyday (RSS feed).  I'm not sure which of those two makes me a bigger geek but it's probably the latter.  So, I'm trying the new release and I'm a little confused why it was released.  I was under the impression that Firefox builds were always bug driven, not release date driven.  I'm very happy with the new release with the extension manager and such but it's still very buggy and there are even  urlLink blocking 0.9 bugs  (at time of writing).  It doesn't matter too much as everything is really a drive to 1.0.  The fiance and I have a shower tonight... Yay gifts!  Speaking of gifts... I peeked at our registry a while ago and was excited to see that someone had bought us these awesome funky  urlLink lamps  for our bedroom (shit... I'm excited  about lamps ) then, yesterday, I was on the list while talking to my brother to give him some ideas and it appears that they were returned.  I don't want to sound selfish and/greedy but I want my fucking lamps.  Now I'm just rambling so I'll sign out... later.

      Last night the fiance and I went down to the  urlLink Royal Cinema  on College.  We were there to see a short film festival featuring films from (holy alliteration) York University students including one by our friend Elise.  The whole thing kind of reminded me of when I was in a band back in high school.  There would usually be about six to eight bands playing and each band was expected to sell a certain number of tickets to fill the place.  Usually one or two bands would bring a bunch of people each and the rest would have around five friends plus their parents.  After each band, the respective friends, and sometimes the band themselves, would get up and leave.  This kind of thing never made sense to me and I always did my best to stay for every band and listen intently to every song (even if it wasn't my bag) just to show my support and hopefully to set an example.    So, last night there were eight films in total.  As each film finished five to ten people would get up and leave.  I was proud of Elise's friends and family as they all stayed right til the end.  I asked Elise if she was happy with her film and it didn't seem that she was (there were some issues with the cinematographer and editor and Elise had to redo a lot of stuff herself).  For what it's worth, I thought her film was the best of the evening and I know she'll do really well in the future.  Which brings me to the title of today's entry... LVE LIFE.  As I was driving home I saw that on a license plate.  My first thought was "Is it LIVE LIFE or LOVE LIFE" and I quickly decided it doesn't matter.  Live your live and Love what you do with it and you'll always be happy.

      It's not a  good  preview but it is a  urlLink preview  and that will have to do for now.  The first Outlaw Golf (OLG) was one of the deciding factors when making the choice between game consoles.  I first heard about the first iteration sometime before  urlLink November 14, 2001 .  The idea of a golf game controlled with the analog stick that featured humour on par (completely unintentional, I swear) with my 9 year old maturity was just too good to be true and I had to have it.   Now OLG was a little short, but it was pretty challenging and a lot of fun.  The replay value was outstanding and the game would usually get popped in when a few buddies were over with a few too many beers in us.  OLG was also a "gateway" game for my dad who until this time didn't understand why, at 25, I was buying kiddy toys.  The humour wasn't his cup of tea but it was a great game for the two of us to play together.  OLG2 will feature all the fun of OLG plus the addition of Golf Cart challenges, five new courses, improved graphics and game play, etc., etc.,  and  will be on LIVE  AND  has been given a budget price tag to encourage impulse buying.  I now love Global Star (the publisher, a division of Take2) as much as I love  urlLink Hypnotix .  I encourage everyone to go pick up  urlLink Outlaw Volleyball  to see what a quality product Hypnotix puts out.

      Although I feel the total dominance of the NBC prime time line up for two evenings might have been a little bit of overkill I still absolutely love  urlLink Last Comic Standing .    For two hours Wednesday and two hours again last night NBC started the second season of one of my favorite shows from last year.  I've got high hopes for this year as well with the whole show resting on one  urlLink pasty little man 's shoulders.  Usually I would think Jimmy's comedy would be a little dirty and too offensive for prime time but even the fiance was laughing out loud at him last night.  One more thing, I'm truly grateful that I won't have to go to the "Buck Star" show anymore.

      Just wanted to make note of the  urlLink Mozilla Firefox 0.9  release candidate... uhm... release.  I'm not great at software reviews so I won't bother... there will be enough of them on the web in the next few days.  Just wanted to note that I've been with Firefox since around November 2002 (when it was Phoenix) and I'm extremely excited about approaching 1.0.

      I love it but I really can't believe they are allowed to sell  urlLink these things .  Here's some simple math incase you need some more 'splaining...   urlLink These beers  + this handy little  urlLink "key chain"  =  urlLink Goodtimes?

       urlLink    One of the weddings from the weekend.  I used to work with the bride... it was really beautiful but whenever the photographer walked by I thougt the floor would fall in.  It would be an understatment to say he was a "big man".&nbsp; urlLink

      I'm not ususally a flower guy but  urlLink these   urlLink things  are fuckin' cool.  Described at  urlLink about.com :  "SOMEONE ONCE SAID that the flowers of cyclamen look like butterflies stopped in motion above water lilies"  I don't think I could describe them any other way but I'll try:  "FUCKIN' COOL, UPSIDE DOWN, CRAZY PETAL TWISTING FLOWER!!!1!1!"  I'm just not as poetic as "someone".  I bring this up for two reasons - one, they're  fuckin' cool  and two, I just booked an appointment for the Fiance and I to pick the flowers for the wedding so flowers were on my mind.    Wedding stuff is getting just  crazy .  This weekend there is a stag and doe, a stag party and a stagette.  We can't go to any of them because the in-laws (or at least Mother) will be in town for the Fiance's shower on Sunday.  Add on to all that the invitations we would like to get out by Friday, the rings we are picking out/ordering on Thursday, the flower appointment Saturday.  Plus, we are going to shopping with the Mother in law when she arrives.  My head will probably explode before it's all said and done.  Oh yeah... wedding stuff plus  urlLink the sickness  made me forget to mow my parent's lawn for three and a half weeks.  I haven't seen it but apparently you needed a  urlLink machete  to hack your way through.  Basically I'm a dick for forgetting but I think I had a good excuse.
