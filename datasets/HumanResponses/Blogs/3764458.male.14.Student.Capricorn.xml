      OK. So today started out with my mom telling me that i can't go see 311, Incubus, or go to Warped unless i have a place to stay for 10 days. So if  anyone  can let me stay at their house for 10 days, i would be  much obliged . Anyway, our pool is coming along quite well. They are filling it up with water, and i can't wait to just jump in. I've been working everyday this week to earn enough money to buy tickets. My brother Ian is going to take me to the concerts, if i find a place to stay, so i have to buy him tickets too. And pay for gas money....damn...that doesn't sound very good on my part. Oh well. I just got my crappy dial-up internet turned back on at my mom's house. It is by far the slowest of the slow. I'm connected at like 1 kbps right now. We can't get anything else out here in the boon-docks. Anyway....I'm going on a diet everybody. And i'm burning 1700 calories a day. I've been on it for 2 days now. I've replaced 2 meals a day with cereal. So i only get about 500-600 calories a day. Which isn't healthy, i think. But hey, the weight should leave fast. Welp, i'm gonna go. Farewell everyone.

      Well, i got up this morning, went to church, came home early because my mom is sick, and slept from 11:00 to 2:30. The day has been so depressing, just because its all cloudy and horrible outside. I'm still at my dad's house, and i don't really want to go home, because we have no internet. I live off of the internet. I only get to get on every-other-weekend. We're planning on getting DSL out at my mom's place, though. We have an HP computer there, and it sucks like no other. It's only got like 4 megs of space left on it. Of course the computer is the only fun thing at my dads because we dont have cable tv. I kind of want to do something tonight. Just to make up for how depressing this day has been. Some people on AIM i just want to murder because they talk to you, and they like, have nothing to talk about, and they don't care about you at all, they just feel like talking to you because you one of the 4 people on their buddylist. I'm going to start writing the script for my movie, which i plan to come out with by January 2005. It's based on my livejournal called "The Diary of a Hitman." I can tell you one thing, i'm gonna need lots of fake blood and hot butter. I don't know what inspired me to write those. I based half of them on my nightmares. I have the creepiest nightmares. I die in every single one of them. Even if they are good dreams, i'll die in the end. I had a dream earlier today that i was fight Stone Phillips with one of those over-sized Q-Tip looking things that were used on some video game. I think it was like American Gladiators or something like that. Anyway, he knocked out of the ring and fell into a bottemless pit, and when you fall in a bottemless pit you die of starvation, but luckily enough for me, at the same time i fell, a murderer with a pistol jumped in with me. And as you can guess, he shot me. That dream kinda sucked. Well i gotta go. Buh bye all.

      Ok, it's 1:22 am, and i am wide awake. I'm sitting here, dreading church in the morning. It's not that i don't like church, but it's just the waking up early part. Yes, I call waking up at 8:00 early. Plus church is usually boring sunday mornings, and i get nothing from the message. Maybe because I am half asleep the whole time...i dunno.. Anyway, i'm home alone (except for my dad, who's sleeping upstairs) and I just noticed a new patch of Poisen Ivy on my hand. Ever since my slave-driving mother forced me to work at least two hours a day (I know, ladee freakin daa, but working at my house is horrible) i've been breaking out with the worst poisen ivy ever. My legs looked like raw meat for awhile, because scratching feels SO good. After a few days i decided to stop scratching it though, because it was even grossing me out, and i had to start wearing pants when ever i went out in public. But i still had scabby, bloody legs. Then i realized that i was scratching them in my sleep, so now i have scars all over my legs that will probably be permanent. I really wanted to go to the Guster show tonight, but i didn't....and that sucks.i can't wait for Warped Tour and Incubus in July, though. I'm gonna skip a 10-day "family" vacation for those two concerts. My family picks the most boring place in the world to go on Vacation, and that place is Asheville, NC. It's nice until about the third day. By the time the 10 days is up, we've done everything at least 4 times. The only things we do is go to Brank's (that is my step father's name) family get together, which blows, and go hiking, which is fun, and go to this thing called the Shindig. Why can't we go to Orlando like any other normal family? Because we're not a normal family. I would go into why we aren't but im sure i've bored you enough. So i'll change the subject. I watched "Vanilla Sky" today. It's one of the best movies i've ever seen. It's very clever, and i love clever movies. It's also got a lot of Radiohead in it...and i love radiohead. Radiohead reminds me of MUSE. And MUSE reminds me of this guy that me and Alex got into an argument about MUSE. He kept saying they sucked, and we kept saying that they didn't. That went on for about...oh..45 minutes or so. Then Andy came over and we went to Rickers and he stayed over till like 5 am. It was kinda boring because Andy wasn't as funny as he usually is. Anyway, i know this is getting long, but im going to keep typing until i go to bed. If you love me you'll keep reading ;) Nonothin for the winky-face. Those of you out there wanting to know what i meant by "nonothin," I shall tell you. When you do, or say something stupid, you say "nonothin" and if you don't then someone can call "hands" on youfor saying that, then you put your hands out, plams facing down, and let the other person slap the backs of them. My brother and his friends started doing it and it rubbed off on me. We've gotten to the point now where if someone calls hands on you that they dont slap you're hands, but you still feel just as guilty for saying the stupid thing and not calling "Nonothin." I was in the middle of a new flash animation when i started this, which is my new hobby. I submit all of my stuff to newgrounds.com, but it all gets voted off. People just don't appreciate my type of humor. I know this comes from nowhere, but i really strongly dislike that Last Straw, of First Straw or whatever it's called song from 311's greatest hits. It was unreleased, and i know why. It sucks. I'm starting to like The Love Song. I used to hate it...strongly. Im gonna take a break on writing now and watch all of the old Homestarrunner toons. Ok, I'm back. Welp, I think im going to bed. G'nite everybody.

      Incubus, 311, Warped, Steve Burns! I can't wait. Anyway, its been like 6 days since I last posted, so I felt that I should post something. I'm just sitting here, doing nothing, working on an animation called "Rice Cakes." I actually think that this one may be funny to the public and not just 4 or 5 people that understand it.   Anyway, nothing else exciting has happened since last time i posted, so I'm just going to go. Taa taa.

      YOU LEFT ME FOR SOME GUY! BUT HE'S COOLER THAN ME SO I WONT ASK WHY!........God, I hate that song. Anyway, I just got back from Church and it was kinda eventful. Today we had baptism, and it was fun watching all of the elderly slip and fall when trying to get out of the water. After church, me and Kris went over to the Georges' house to empty the kitty litter and things, since they are out of town they let Kris be the caretaker of their house. Then we went to CiCi's and ate. Now i am just sitting here rubbing my horrid sunburn on my back waiting for something exciting to happen. I might do something with Jesse. Welp, until tomorrow, buh-bye.

      Today was eventful. I started the day working for a few hours around the house, then I swam for a bit. Then we had a 4th of July party and i almost died. You see, we had these huge, illegal fireworks and me, Kris, and Jubal decided that we should tie 3 together and light them all at the same time. It was great, but  one of them exploded before it went in the air and its explosion was like 2 feet away from me, so naturally, i fell and did one of the those cool roll and then hop up really fast things. Then we all had a good laugh, got in the pool and we are now going to bed.  A real picture of what happened:
