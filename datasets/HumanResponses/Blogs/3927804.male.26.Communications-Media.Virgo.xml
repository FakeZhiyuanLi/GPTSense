      Of course you haven't heard any mention of the issues. Like all facists, an opinion contrary to yours is as audible as a fart in a tornado. We don't need to discuss abortion... we won. It's like listening to a Buffalo Bills fan talk about the missed field goal with this issue.  I understand the whole Kerry by the tractor thing. When your a northern Democrat in the south, they issue you a gun when you cross into Virginia.(just for your own protection.)  Let us turn now to our Commander-and-Chimp, who set all kinds of records at the Retard Olympics by snubbing the NAACP. Is he aware that African-Americans are a RACE of people, not an interest group? There is a possibility here that the electoral college vote may not come down to a state run by his brother this time, and he might actually have to win. Maybe he was on vacation that day and missed the short bus, but as I see it snubbing an entire population of people might not be the best plan. Keep up the good work Georgie.  Here's some fresh Bush Economics from  urlLink dubyaspeak.com  :  Pennsylvania's unemployment rate is 5.1 percent. That's good news for people who are trying to find jobs.                 -- It's not exactly good news until those people have found jobs, Dubya. Smoketown, Pennsylvania, Jul. 9, 2004  This economy of ours is steady and strong. It's steady and strong. It's steady and strong, which means people are going back to work.                -- You are getting very sleepy... Washington, D.C., Jul. 2, 2004  I feel so much better now.

      So John Kerry "re-enacted" his "heroic" actions during the Vietnam War so that he could video-tape the actions and save them, for posterity, of course...not for any sort of personal gain.   A new book out, containing quotes from Swift Boat veterans, alleges that Kerry used an super 8mm home video camera, purchased at the base PX.   Some veterans claim that Kerry left Vietnam early not because he received three purple hearts - but because he'd shot enough footage of himself to take home for his future political campaigns.   My question is why. Why take videos of oneself, even recreating the actual events (without putting any sort of spin on it, I'm sure). Why narrate one's own "heroic" actions on video? Why interview oneself about these events? Why masquerade around like an infantryman? For those who may not see the relevance of the last question - please remember that Kerry was in the Navy - not the Marines, not the Army. Kerry wouldn't have known the first thing about being an infantryman.&nbsp; Why attempt to use one's actions of thirty years ago in an attempt to sway voters into believing that you're qualified to be the Commander in Chief? How do the Dem's go from a draft-dodger to a Purple Heart recipient? Why do the recent Dem first-ladies have two stinking last names?   Perhaps we could convince Al-Queda to lay down all the real stuff and just act it all out in a Hollywood studio - special effects and all.&nbsp;   So - maybe we should just accept the Kerry saw himself as a big-time politician, even thirty years ago. After all, I can respect a man with goals and ambitions -&nbsp;I've got goals and ambitions of my own. So - forget the video tapes. Forget the Spielberg protege who's desperately trying to figure out which scenes are "re-enactments" and which are "real" from his introduction film.&nbsp;   I, like others, are just simply waiting to find out where these candidates stand on the issues. Where's the pro-life corps in this whole convention? How about the pro-gun control lobbyists? I'll admit - I can't stomach much of the convention coverage, so I haven't watched much of it, but I haven't heard anyone mention "the issues." The headlines haven't covered it, I haven't seen much of it in the commercials that I've seen. I do know that Kerry's gonna have a hard time convincing the gun-control group that he's in favor of gun control after his twangy commercial where he's wearing Levi's, toting a gun and standing near a tractor. All that's missing is Boss Hogg and a stem of hay sticking out of his mouth...he's just a good 'ole boy, never meanin' no harm...

      What we have here&nbsp; is the culmination of an idea that Kurt and I had while discussing the "benefits" of watching Bill Clinton's speech to the Democratic National Convention. We'll publically humiliate each other's points of view on whatever we feel is important content for you, the viewer.

      So, Joe Baca (D - Rialto, CA) is upset that the border patrol has been conducting inland sweeps to round up illegals in Riverside and San Francisco counties. The sweeps, which happened a few months ago, rounded up hundreds of illegals and deported them back to Mexico, or wherever they came from.  Joe's upset because the sweeps caused "concern" for his constituents.  I wonder how Joe's constituents feel about illegals taking thier jobs, collecting welfare, etc. etc.?  I wonder how they feel about just anyone being able to sneak across the border without fear of deportation or, in fact, of what they're going to do when they get here - because if they can't find work, they can always collect welfare.  No, I think that the border patrol's sweeps are a great idea, and I hope that they continue. The real question here is whether a person is a legal or illegal alien. If they're legal, they've got a reason to be here. If they're illegal, they've got no business here, and it's against the best interests of National Security and the United States in general to have them here - send 'em packing!

      This movie is amazing.&nbsp; Every actor in this movie does a great job.&nbsp; This movie has almost everything you could want.&nbsp; It has sex, a quasi-hott girl, fighting, gratuitous blood and gore, the whole psycho-analytical thing.... its great.   The movie is primarily about this insomniac, "Jack",played magnificently by Edward Norton, who just has a blah life.&nbsp; His life is filled with going to&nbsp;support groups even though he doesn't have any aliments.&nbsp; That is until he "meets" Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt.&nbsp; Tyler is an eccentric soap salesman who just does what he feels.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jack" is drawn to Tyler because he is everything he wishes he could be......&nbsp; They end up&nbsp;starting their own type of therapy, where guys get together and relieve stress by beating the shit out of each other.&nbsp; As time goes on Tyler isn't satisfied with all that, he wants to take it a step further.&nbsp; Pretty soon he forms a club&nbsp;where the members go out and do random acts of violence and mischief.&nbsp; Thats when "Jack" decides he needs to stop Tyler before its too late, there's just one twist.........&nbsp; You'll have to watch the movie to find out, but I will guarantee that you won't see it coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone I talk to about this movie says they need to see it again.... you will too.&nbsp; This movie is the man's "Steel Magnolias".&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&nbsp;don't like this movie you might as well cut up your man card.&nbsp; Just remember, ---You are not your job.&nbsp; You are not how much money you have in the bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not the contents of your wallet.&nbsp; You are not your&nbsp;khakis.&nbsp; You are not a beautiful and&nbsp;unique snow flake.&nbsp; The things you own end up owning you.&nbsp; Self-improvement is masturbation.&nbsp; Self-destruction might be the answer---.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure its no surprise, I give this movie *****.   LEGEND  *****&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to do&nbsp;Jennifer Aniston anytime you want.  ****&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having an alternate personality that looks like Brad Pitt.&nbsp;  ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beating the shit out of&nbsp;a friend.... and still be good friend when its done.  **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually watching Steel Magnolias.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having man-tits.

      I can't believe that no one has done this one yet!   I just watched the part where the pledges have the cinder blocks tied to their cranks and drop them off the ledge and the fat black kid's cinder block drop through the man hole cover - like a black man needs help in that department - I'm thinking that Blue might have gotten a bit more action that way...   Now we're at the part where the gay carrot-top is giving the BJ class - funny stuff!! I love it that the queer whoops the shit out of Frank the Tank.   Will Farrell absolutely makes this movie - he's hysterical, shooting himself in the jugular with a tranq dart, streaking, trying to molest Snoop Dog, and the doll.   In all, this is a hysterical look at the disillusionment that often goes along with marriage, work, kids, my life...   In all, I busted a gut watching this movie, every time! This one gets *****!!!   Legend:  ***** Being 90 years old and KY wrestling two college co-eds.  **** Banging Leah Remini - she's too freaking HOT!  *** Dying in a pool of KY jelly with a couple of large breasted college co-eds standing over me  ** Banging Elisha Cuthbert only to find out she's not quite 18 - DOH!  * Ever seeing Brack in a pool of KY - it'd be a train wreck syndrome, you know it's gonna be bad, but you've still gotta look.

      All right, it was Thug Life on Tuesday night...I started with this one - I'm in a hotel and I've only got HBO - what do you want, it was all that was on; I'm too cheap to buy porn.  So, this one's kinda stupid, ok - it's a lot stupid. So, this wigger (who happens to be the son of the man running for California governor) decides that he's going to help his dad's campaign; much to the campaign manager's dismay. So, the to-be governor and the campaign manager cook up a scheme to have the wigger "kidnapped" by a couple of hard-core thugs (Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson) who are actors from a commercial that the to-be governor shot about crime.   From this point, everything starts to go wrong, including the wigger wising up to the fact that this is a scam and going nuts - until the three of them really get jacked up by thugs!   In all, I laughed out loud a few times, but if I heard the word "shiznit" far too many times. *** for making me laugh out loud, -* for over using ghetto slang; poor Snoop Dog.  Legend: ***** TuPac's All Eyes on Me album **** Biggy Small's Big Poppa *** P Diddy ** Vanilla Ice * Kurt singing Ice, Ice Baby and doing the running man

      Great flick. If you've ever sold anything, you know these scumbags. Giovanni Ribisi, stars as Seth, a small time hustler, who gets invited to work for J.T. Marlin, a stock market "chopshop". Trying to please his emotionally handicapped father, played exquisitely by Ron Rifkin, he accepts the job only to learn he is lying and stealing for a gang of crooks disguised as stock brokers. Ribisi, whose acting credits unfortunately include  urlLink this crap , owned this shit. Vin Diesel plays a non-mongloid. Ben Affleck plays Alex Baldwin's character in "Glengarry Glen Ross", but mercifully isn't in that many scenes. Nicky Katt delivers a great performance as the shithead. In terms of hotties, this has Nia Long playing Abbie Halpert, the receptionist. I watched this on TNT so I don't know if she gets naked or not. In my mental version she plays a fuck machine. The film also allows you to follow the effects of Seth's treachery on the average "sucker", and unflinchingly shows the repercussions of his deceit. He is destroying people, and when he becomes hip to this fact, Seth makes a decision that destroys all those around him. Boiler Room has a "great moment" in it. (ex. The scar scene from Jaws, the needle scene from Pulp fiction, Obi Wan being struck down.) The story of his bike accident was riveting and followed through to completion by the end of the film. A great drama that doesn't try to teach a lesson, but looks long and hard at the nature of both losers and scumbags. I can't believe I've now enjoyed 2 Vin Diesel films: *****  ***** Daisy Duke  **** The General Lee   *** Cooter    ** Bo and Luke     * Enos

      Clint Eastwood and (shocker) Gene Hackman star in this above average thriller about a jewel thief who witnesses the President beat up and murder the hot wife of a powerful industrialist friend. Scott Glenn and Ed Harris rack up major acting points as a Secret Service agent and a police detective, respectively. Clint rawks as Luther Whitney,the aging jewel thief, and proves that even though he's old as dirt he can still play a badass.  Good Story. Good Acting. Gene Hackman plays an awesome evil bastard.   The love interest between Seth Frank (Harris) and Luther's hottie daughter (played reasonably well by Laura Linney) is not quite believable, but they don't try real hard to make it work, so it's not awful.  I hadn't heard of it, and had to look up the name before I wrote this.   I give it a ****.  Legend: ***** "'Shrooms" from Hoolihans served on the belly of a stripper  **** Costa's Mom's Guacamole smeared on a Sorority Girl   *** Pizza and non-alcoholic beer at a church function    ** a Chicken McNugget wedged in a plumber's asscrack     * A White Castle Slider propping open a toilet seat

      This was actually a very good movie, or so I thought.&nbsp; There might be people out there who disagree.&nbsp;   This movie is about a guy named Beck, played by, gets better every movie, The Rock.&nbsp; Ya know I wish he would just go by his real name, Dewayne....... on second thought.&nbsp; Beck is a guy who has had a few rough times in his&nbsp;life.&nbsp; All he wants to do is open his&nbsp;own&nbsp;Southern-Italian restaurant, but he can't until he is done&nbsp;paying his debt off.&nbsp; How does he pay his debt off you ask, by being a bounty hunter if you will.&nbsp; If you need something gotten, Beck will get it for you.&nbsp;   The movie takes place in Brazil.&nbsp; Beck is sent there to retrieve the son of his boss, apparently his son did&nbsp;some bad things that he must come back to LA to answer for.&nbsp; Travis, the son, played&nbsp;by Seann Williams Scott does a great job.&nbsp; Its nice to see he can play something other than that annoying kid we all knew back in high....right Costa?&nbsp; There are all sorts of cool things that happen in the movie, from cool fight scenes, pygmy militia fights, horny monkeys, even little parasites that will swim up your&nbsp;wing wang!&nbsp; It has some interesting characters.&nbsp; You have the hott heroine, played by Rosario Dawson, the crazy scottsman, played by Ewen Bremner, the crazy judo-monkey-flying ninja style fighter, played&nbsp;by Ernie Reyes Jr.&nbsp; and last but not least the man, Christopher Walken playing Hatcher.&nbsp; An American who took over this little town to make them mine gold for him.&nbsp; He does such an awesome job.&nbsp; There is this part where he tries to describe the tooth fairy to a buch of thugs.....very funny.&nbsp;   Anyway.&nbsp; This movie was great.&nbsp; Is has some action things that really haven't been done before, and as action hero's go I think The Rock is fitting nicely into the mold.&nbsp; He has a bright future in the action movie business.&nbsp; I give this movie&nbsp;****   LEGEND  *****&nbsp; A couple of drunk&nbsp;American drive into&nbsp;Canada with Hummers, stick a flag in the ground and proclaim it America North!  ****&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunk&nbsp;Americans being George W, and Dick Cheney.  ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money that The Rock made after Vince McMahon got his cut.  **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing who Vince McMahon is.  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking WWE is Real!

      "Everybody Loves Raymond" had sex with "The American President" and the baby was born with Downs Syndrome.   Not as funny as Ray Romano's stand-up, this is a tired example of the hometown-boy makes good formula. The addition of Gene Hackman as President Monroe "Eagle" Cole, didn't do that much to improve an average romantic comedy. Maura Tierney (hometown hottie) and Marcia Gay Harden (possibly dirty MILF hottie) don't get naked.   "Handy" Harrison (Romano)is a small town fix-it guy who accidently gets wrapped up in a mayoral race with the recently divorced Cole. Cole then asks Handy's girlfriend out, and (cue the laugh track) hilarity ensues.   The saving graces of this 90 minute sitcom were standout performances by Christine Baranski and Fred Savage (I know, I know...)  I want to see Maura Tierney naked. Imagining that help me get through this marginal comedy.  A star for each time I laughed: *** -1 star for each time a comic moment was blown by a half-assed "Raymond" bit. -* for a total of : **  ***** Maura Tierney in a Prison movie  **** Humor to be gleaned from the name "Marcia Gay Harden"   *** Christine Baranski's voice    ** Coming down from a Nyquil buzz     * Being Unemployed and watching mediocre movies

      Part of my Gene Hackman Weekend. David Mamet wrote this and the Dialogue sparkles brilliantly. This would have made a better book-on-tape, because the acting wasn't worth a shit. Hackman is lackluster as con-man / thief, Joe Moore. He supposed to be this awesome deceiver of others, but anybody fooled by one of his "cons", would have to be a retard. Sam Rockwell, who is usually awesome, was another non-actor, along with Danny DeVito. It would be easier to believe Bigfoot won the Kentucky Derby than the choppy love interest dialogue between Hackman and Sharon Stone look-a-like,Rebecca Pidgeon, was for real. Seriously, No way is she banging his geriatric ass. I would tell you more about the plot but I got up to wash dishes after 25 minutes, and then took a nap. Maybe not the best of Hackman's work. Watch  urlLink GlenGarry Glen Ross  instead for what good Mamet writing should sound like. I'll give one star for Sam Rockwell's moustache, and another for how funny DeVito looked standing around a crowd of "real-sized" people." **  ***** Sharon Stone's bush  **** Halle Berry's bush   *** Sam Elliot's Moustache    ** My Hair circa 1991     * Costa's hair now

      Bruce Willis stars as John Smith, a mercenary wrapped up in a prohibition-era gang war in...Texas. This was a cool odd-ball flick. Done in the stylings of a Bogart film Noir, with a gritty  urlLink  Raymond Chandler  voice-over, this is actually a western. Amazingly, it works really well. The two genres flow nearly seamlessly. The success may be partially chalked up to both types of film relying heavily on strong silent types. (so Willis does have to talk too much, saving him the anguish of having to act.) The chicks in this movie (Karina Lombard and Alexandra Powers)are not A-list hot, but they're better then Amanda Plumber (WTF does that mean?). Christopher Walken doesn't play an over-the-top sociopath in this movie, so why the fuck was he cast...rent King of New York. Micheal Imperioli must have had acting lessons between this movie and his Sopranos audition. His suckiness sticks out in a cast of character actors as catagorically bad. David Patrick Kelly (Jerry Horne from  urlLink Twin Peaks ), is unconvincing as a badass but delivers an interesting performance as a love-torn mob boss. John Smith is 1 part Terminator, 2 parts El Mariachi (before Bandaras fucked it up), and 3 parts  urlLink Vincenzo Coccotti . Bronson is a pussy next to him. Willis doesn't quite carry it. Watch this and you probably will remember it later. I give it ***1/2.

      Man, this one had to drive Kurt's commie-liberal animal-rights whacko's insane!   So, it's the basic Tarzan story with a twist - Tarzan  likes  being civilized! The Jane of the story is Lila Jute, played by the foxy  urlLink Patricia Arquette .  urlLink Tim Robbins  plays Nathan Bronfman, a slightly psychotic behavioral scientist who's obsessed with table manners. Nathan and Lila discover "Puff" (as they named him), played by  urlLink Rhys Ifans  living nekkid in the forest while hiking. After Lila gets naked and chases him down, she about gives him a heart attack, and probably a concussion (he's masturbating while sitting in a tree looking at her, and just as he reaches....he falls out of the tree - it's really quite funny!   So, the whole story goes on, and on - finally Lila frees "Puff," takes him back to the woods and has lots of sex with him (I'm thinking doggy style). Nathan comes looking for "Puff" to take him back to the laboratory and Puff ends up killing him. He testifies before Congress about the wayward-ness of the human race, blah, blah, blah...but in the end, the mistress lab assistant picks up Puff and takes him back - and the last cut scene in the movie is two lab rats that Lila also freed holding up a sign that says, "New York".   In all, I laughed out loud a couple of times, so this one will get a ***.   Legend:  ***** Romping nekkid through the woods following Patricia Arquette's nekkid booty.  **** Romping nekkid through the woods thinking about Patricia Arquett's nekkid booty.  *** Falling out of a tree nekkid masturbating to thoughts of Patricia Arquett's nekkid booty.  ** Getting caught masturbating in the woods and having to endure 315'er jokes.  * Catching Brackman masturbating in the woods - sends shivers up my spine....

      This is a Top 10er in my book. Jean Reno plays Leon, a "cleaner" who takes in a young girl (Natalie "Magna CUM loudly" Portman) who has just witnessed the murder of her shitty family by a bad cop (Gary Oldman). He takes her under his wing and teaches her to kill. Let's review... Natalie Portman looking hot as hell, and being way below the legal limit. Oldman at his most scary psychotic. Action sequences on par with "Die Hard" (the good one with Hans Gruber). It also has some top notch humor, and dialogue that sounds like Tarantino at his best. Leon is among the Baddest Asses ever to grace cinema. The DVD has extra footage that improves the story and makes this a grand slam action title. No Doubt about it: *****  Legend: ***** Punching Mimes  **** Watching People Punch Mimes   *** Imagining Mimes being punched    ** Being a mime     * Peeing your pants when Mimes approach

      This flick stars Dennis Quaid as Biff the Clown (also known as Wallace) who, along with his brother, posseses the ability to start fires with thier minds.   Now, I know that you're immediately thinking  Firestarter , but this is really a comedy. A really, really dumb comedy. But there was some funny stuff in it - mostly when Dennis Quaid tries to laugh maniacally and he's throwing fireballs at his brother, Wilder (Arliss Howard).  Actually, it wasn't that funny - but there weren't any other movies on and I'm waiting for my next shipment from NetFlix.   So, don't bother with this one, it gets a *.  Legend: ***** Wife and kids leave town and take the dog with them, so I'm the only one at home. **** Having a 32" TV and a PS2, with no wife, kids and dog at home. *** Brackman not being able to stand up to his wife and play Socom online. ** Not having a PC that I can game with Kurt on. * Not being able to stay awake long enough to be irresponsible while wife, kids and dog are out of town.

      If you love to smoke weed, whether you admit it or not, if you love big booty girls, if you just want to laugh at a pretty funny movie then this is the movie for you.&nbsp; Believe me, this movie isn't winning any awards.&nbsp; If you just want a brainless comedy to watch then this is it.&nbsp; I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.   The movie is about two guys, Craig(Ice Cube) and Smokey(Chris Tucker).&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole movie takes place on a Friday...... hence the name....retard!&nbsp; It starts out where Craig got fired from his job so he's going to be home alone all day.&nbsp; His friend, the neihborhood drug dealer, Smokey comes over to cheer him up.&nbsp; Smokey convinces Craig to smoke weed for the first time.&nbsp; Little does Craig know that Smokey isn't supposed to be smoking it, he's supposed to be selling it.&nbsp; Well Smokeys contact, Big Worm, finds out and says he'll kill both of them if they don't give them his money by 10:00pm.&nbsp; And so it begins, a day full of gut bustin jokes and a pretty hott soundtrack in the background.&nbsp; Of course&nbsp;the movie is funnier when you're high....&nbsp;or so I've heard.&nbsp; Believe me, even if you don't smoke, which you shouldn't, you'll enjoy this movie.&nbsp; I only talked about the main premise.&nbsp; There is so much more stuff that goes on.&nbsp; I give this movie ***.

      OK, this movie is, for lack of a better word... perfect.&nbsp; I thought this movie was fantastic in every way.&nbsp; It introduced us to new special effects, new actors, it revived the careers of old actors....(Joe Pantoliano), just a great movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Its starts with a guy named Neo, he's just your average office stiff by day, hacker insomniac extroardinaire by night.&nbsp; He knows there is something more out there but he can't put his finger on it.&nbsp; Well the movie continues with weird tattooed women, a girl named Trinity and agent named Smith.&nbsp; There's a freaky scene where Neo gets rescued from the incubator where he really exists.&nbsp; Its almost as if this pod is full of hate paste....pretty nasty.&nbsp; Neo wakes up and realizes that his life was just a dream.&nbsp; Morpeus, played by Larry Fishbourne is trying to convince Neo and everyone else that he is the ONE.&nbsp; A savior of sorts that is going to free humans from the grip of the Machines.&nbsp;   This movie has it all, fighting, car chases, hott women in dominatrix-ish outfits.&nbsp; This movie belongs in everyone's collection.&nbsp; In closing, just remember this, "There is no spoon"&nbsp; I give this movie *****   LEGEND  *****&nbsp; Getting your salad tossed by Carrie-Ann Moss while you get magic hands by the women wearing the red dress.  ****&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching Carrie-Ann Moss toss the salad of the women in the red dress.  ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realizing that Carrie-Ann Moss is the best thing Canada has to offer.  **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone from Canada reading this and being offended.  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually being Canadian.&nbsp;

      OK, First things first... I thought this movie was awesome.&nbsp; I liked it better then the first.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, the first one was awesome because it was new technology and special effects, but I moved on when the second one came out.&nbsp;   On a personal note; I don't get it when people get stuck in the past.&nbsp; You know the type, they think that older movies are better, they think that older music is better, that Lp's sound better than CD's..... come into the future, the waters fine.&nbsp; Thats the beauty of technology!   OK, I'm better now.   Reloaded starts out about 6 months after The Matrix.&nbsp; Neo is coming into his own, finally realizing the full capability of his powers.&nbsp; In short, he is one bad mofo.&nbsp; I thought 99.9% of this movie was absolutely fantastic.&nbsp; The fight scenes were awesome, the highway chase was just.......DAMN!!!!!!!&nbsp; I didn't think Trinity could be hotter...then they put her on a Ducati, oh how I wish I was the Key Maker.&nbsp; Just everything about this movie was great.&nbsp; There were a bunch of new characters.&nbsp; A few of the most memorable one were, Link, played by Harold Perrineau( think romeo and juliet), bad ass Seraph, played by Collin Chou.&nbsp; Niobe, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, the very cool Merovingian, played by Lambert Wilson.&nbsp; The totally awesome and freaky Twins played by Adrian and Neil Rayment.&nbsp; And last but certainly not least, the super duper hott, sexy, luscious, spank bank worthy Persephone, played by Monica Bellucci;   by the way you can see her in a nice teddy on Maximonline.com.     The only confusing part of this movie was.... you guessed it the Architect scene, by the way Will Ferrell played a much more convincing and hilarious Architect.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hated the " you know why",&nbsp;"you know who", "you know what".........WTF!!!!&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; In all this movie was fantastic.&nbsp; I give it *****.   LEGEND  *****&nbsp;Being able to see what happened in the bathroom with the Merovingian and the girl who ate the aphrodisiac filled piece of cake.  ****&nbsp;&nbsp; Being Neo when he had to kiss Persephone like he kisses Trinity.  ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the scene had been Trinity kissing Persephone.  **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Persephone made Neo kiss Morpheus.  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rubbing one out and not being able to get the vision of Neo kissing Morpeus out of your mind....... I can't believe I wrote that!

      So here's the thing - I was reading Brack's post about Revolutions and thinking of other trilogies - great and not so great.  In all of the trios that I've ever seen, the second one sucks by comparison to the first. Matrix wins a special prize because the third was even worse than the second!  Think about these:  Star Wars compared to Empire Strikes Back - Episode IV kills V! But then in Return of the Jedi - we're back to a great story and decent special effects.  How about the Fellowship of the Ring compared to Two Towers - Fellowship is simply a better movie. TT was a great movie, but when compared to Fellowship, I have to go with that as the favorite. Jackson does a great job with reviving the series in Return of the King, I must say.  I don't know - what do you guys think - am I wrong? Are there other trios out there that disprove this theory?

      I thought it might be nice to throw a shout-out to the site that I know we all use and love - especially when it comes to doing movie reviews; although, I'm not sure that Kurt's recent additions really qualify.   Kurt, when I said fuck-bag movies, I thought you were going to review porn - and I was rather looking foward to it - that being said....Stargate? Next, I assume you'll do Starship Troopers? C'mon - how about some REAL sci-fi???   I'm just bustin' your nuts - back to this post...   The  urlLink  Internet Movie Database   aka  urlLink imdb.com  is an invaluable asset to us, especially when it comes to filmographies and a who's who in movies.   This site is fantastic, and a great resource if you want to know what semi-intelligent folks think about movies - not us simple folk at movie reviews by us.   Thanks, imdb - keep up the good work!

      This is one of my favorite all-time movies...for those of you who may have enjoyed War Games, this one's right along the same lines.   High school kid Paul Stevens ( urlLink Christopher Collet ) finds a new research lab has moved into town. After the head research scientist ( urlLink John Lithgow , who, by the way, was born in Rochester, NY) begins mac-ing it with his mom, Paul finds himself invited to go on a tour of this secret facility. Being the bright kid that he is, he realizes that this lab is creating 99.998% pure plutonium - the best stuff on earth!   Paul and his girlfriend ( urlLink Cynthia Nixon , from "The Pelican Brief" and "Sex in the City") decide to steal a sample of this plutonium and create his own personal atomic bomb - for a science fair project!   John Lithgow gives a decent performance - certainly not Oscar material, but decent nonetheless.   This film was directed by  urlLink Marshall Brickman  who has been a long-time collaborator with Woody Allen - so there's a decent sense of humor throughout the movie. John Lithgow's got a funny line or two throughout the movie - my favorite - "You try to tough it out with them, they'll lock you in a room somewhere and throw away the room!" In reference to the Fed's chasing Paul.   In all, I'll give this one **** of *****.   Legend:  ***** Subscribing to gay porn with your ex-boss' email address  **** Subscribing to gay porn with the email address of a friend who likes to compare your wife to a 12 year old boy.  *** Seeing lesbians make-out in an SUV on your way home from Fourth of July fireworks, and no-one believes you - but it's good for a couple of number three's!  ** Realizing that your friend is gonna make fun of you for enjoying this movie.  * Realizing that you're friend who likes to make comments about your wife resembling a 12 year old boy is gonna thrash you on his next post.

      OK.....what?&nbsp; What just happened???&nbsp; Who?.......What????&nbsp; I know what?????&nbsp; Why?????&nbsp; Come again????--------&nbsp; This pretty much sums up this movie.&nbsp;   For those of you who still haven't seen this movie yet, either living in a cave.........or Iowa, its just ok.&nbsp; Its the last of the Matrix series of movies.....or is it?&nbsp; Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Co. return to do a final battle with the machines.&nbsp; The fight scenes were awesome, the special effects were amazing, but the story........ I wouldn't be surprised if the Wachowski brothers&nbsp;found a retarded prostitute, gave her some crayons and paper and told her to&nbsp;"be creative".&nbsp; Maybe I missed the point of this movie.&nbsp; I mean I know it was the end and it showed the final battle and it.......kinda answered a few lingering question from the first two but....&nbsp; I can remember walking out of this movie and looking at my friend and asking "where am i?", "whats my name?"&nbsp; This was one confusing ass movie.&nbsp; It could have been about 2 hours shorter.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I thought the first one was amazing, I really loved the second one but this one was like... huh??&nbsp; Was the movie in english...what?????&nbsp; If you haven't seen it you might as&nbsp;well watch it,&nbsp;kind of a means to an end... I guess.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;I just went cross-eyed trying to think of more to write.&nbsp; I give it ***.   &nbsp;  LEGEND  *****&nbsp; Hoping there&nbsp;is a deleted scene where Trinity, Persephone, and&nbsp;Niobe&nbsp; have a&nbsp;menage a trois aboard the Icarus.   ****&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubbing one out while thinking about Trinity, Persephone, and&nbsp;Niobe&nbsp; have a&nbsp;menage a trois aboard the Icarus.   ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishing that Neo would cowboy up and bang&nbsp;Trinity&nbsp;how she likes it, that dirty little whore.   **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask the architect, I have no&nbsp;idea.   *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rubbing one out while trying to think about&nbsp;Trinity, Persephone, and&nbsp;Niobe but Morpheous, the Merovingian, and the little asian dude keep&nbsp;sneaking in your mind....... this is hypothetical, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      OK, I am going to be pretty vague about this movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere thought of this movie makes me want to tie a string to my nut sack,&nbsp;tie the other end to a bridge and jump.&nbsp; This has to be absolute worst movie I have ever seen.&nbsp;   In a nut shell, its about a guy played by Chris Elliott.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know who he is, he was the freaky stalker with&nbsp;the pimple on his eye ball in Something About Mary.&nbsp; He is a papered little bitch who wants to prove to his dad that he can make it on his own.&nbsp; Well the movie mainly consists of him on a ship being made to do stupid ass things by the crew, only to be the hero in the end, all the while being aided by a mer-man?????&nbsp; Are you friggin kidding me!!&nbsp; I want to drive the point home that if you watch this movie&nbsp;after reading this, go to your tool box, get out a hammer and smack the shit out&nbsp;of your junk cause your a RETARD.&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't be more serious.&nbsp; I would rather look at photos of Kurt Cobain after he shot himself then watch this movie again.&nbsp; I actually lost the ability to form whole sentences after I saw this......still recovering.....&nbsp; I give this movie *.

      Okay, I know I'm going to have to eat shit for this one. Let me start out by saying I bought this DVD remembering how cool a movie it was. I LIKED it. Then I watched it. Perhaps I've seen enough good Sci-Fi since 1994, to recognize bad Sci-Fi... and lo and behold I do. It's Stargate. I remember thinking the special effects were awesome. They weren't (Think  urlLink "V - The Final Battle"  in terms of FX prowess) I remember thinking the story was original. Explorers from our time stumble across a relic that puts them in contact with another world. They fight the injustices of that world. They return home minus one who decides to stay. Hmm lets see... There's  urlLink This  and  urlLink This  and  urlLink This  and  urlLink This.  (just off the top of my head). In fact, that's pretty much every sci-fi movie from E.T. to Metopolis.  Kurt Russell does this thing where he adopts a kid from the alternate universe and protects him after seeing his own son shoot himself with an unsafe firearm. It is to true emotion what a lap dance is to sex.  James Spader played someone I didn't hate in this movie. A stunt he was unable to repeat until  urlLink 2002  and honestly that was just because of the spanking of the very hot ass of Maggie Gyllenhal.  So it all comes down to "Did this movie suck?".  I guess not. If it came on the Sci-Fi channel in 2 years I might watch if I'd already jerked off that night. I traded in the DVD I bought for a pack of smokes and a bag of twizzlers. I give it a ***.  PS: Fanboys need not comment. I understand your lonely...really I do.  Legend: ***** Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath  **** Ozzy Osbourne Solo circa 1981   *** Sharon Osbourne naked    ** Ozzy Ozbourne circa 1991     * Ozzy Osbourne cleaning up dog shit

      Here's a movie that is so bad it makes you punch the clerk that let you rent it.   Seriously, It's like taking a shit and finding 3 feet of small intestine looping out of your asshole. The roster is impressive. Vincent D'Onfrio, Cameron Diaz, Dan Ackroyd, Keanu Reeves... 2 minutes in and you hate the characters so intensely that you hope that its actually a health class filmstrip ( 15 minutes long...Everyone dies) instead of a feature length (FFUUUCCCKKKK!!!) movie. They are dirty, nasty, stupid and pointless. The story wanders around like a hobo that got clipped by a cowcatcher,after sleeping off a night of drinking isopropyl. Courtney Love is in it, playing a character who acts like Courtney Love. (and she's the most lovable).   They do all die in the end, so it has its high points.  8 years later, I'm still trying to get back the hour and a half I lost watching this wormy piece of shit. And I'm still pissed I haven't been able to.  I give it a * (duh)  Legend: ***** Cameron Diaz drunk and horny  **** Keanu Reeves getting his ass kicked    *** Courtney Love Horny (she's always fucked up, so why qualify)    ** That picture of Kurt Cobain after he shot himself     * Dan Ackroyd Horny

      All Right fuckers, you want obscure...You got it. This is a French movie, so you have to read subtitles (automatically eliminating Costa and Brackman as target audience members). It's a post-apocalyptic dark comedy about cannabalism, and it's one of the funniest pieces of celluloid I've ever seen. What makes it work is the main character, Louison (played by the incredible  urlLink Dominique Pinon ) is a mime, so a lot of the humor comes from expression not language.  The premise is this: Doomsday has come and gone in provincial France. The only real currency is food. Louison, an unemployed clown gets work as an apprentice butcher in this boarding house/ delicatessan. Here's the kicker... the butcher is always looking for help because his apprentices are killed and served as food to the freakish guests of the boarding house. The butcher's daughter however, falls in love with Louison, and hilarity insues as Louison is continuously being saved from death by his love, with the help of rebels who realize how fucked up it is to eat house guests.   Ha Ha Ha.  Seriously though, anyone who has ever even thought in the back of their mind that they might want to try a career in film should be required to watch the sex scene in the last half of the second reel. It is genius.  This is an easy entry into my top 20 comedies of all time. *****  PS: Despite having 81 credits under his belt Pinon has only starred in a couple English films. He played a wino in the Harrison Ford movie  urlLink Frantic  and had a bit part in the awful  urlLink Alien Resurrection   Legend: ***** Movies where French people eat each other  **** Movies where French people are humiliated   *** Movies making fun of the French    ** Movies with Jerry Lewis     * Gerard Depardieu

      This movie was suggested by the Isaac Asimov book by the same title, although, it is really not true to the book at all.   Nevertheless, this is a fantastic movie! My contention remains, Will Smith doesn't make a bad movie! There are a couple of twists in this flick, that  if  you're observant, you'll see them coming.   The synopsis is like this: In the world of the future, robots are a part of everyday life. Robots perform those duties that humans feel are beneath them, like dog walking and garbage pick-up - but they are also trusted with children's lives and as personal assistants. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a techno-phobic cop that has spent much of the past few years looking for a reason to believe that robots are bad news - regardless of the three laws that robots are hard-wired with:  Law 1: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow&nbsp;a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law.  Law 2: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.  Law 3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law.   Eventually, Spooner (Will Smith) is the only man alive that has seen the worst coming - now he's got to stop an Armageddon between humans and robots.   This movie is one of the best I've seen recently (albeit, it's been a bit slow since the last Lord of the Rings), but the special effects are AWESOME, Will Smith drives a futuristic  urlLink Audi&nbsp;Sport RSQ &nbsp;that it simply fantastic - but eventually he's forced to rely on his old standby, an  urlLink MV Augusta F4  with a wicked paint job! There is a great cycle chase scene, and the F4 gets toasted! Another great prop is Will Smith's guns - if anyone knows&nbsp; what the pistols and the automatic are, I'd sure be interested!   One interesting about this movie is that Will Smith (Spooner) so hates technology, that he's wearing Converse All Stars (circa 2004) and has an old JVC CD player that confuses Spooner's partner in the film, Dr. Susan Calvin, played by the hot  urlLink Bridget Moynahan , as she attempts to command the CD player with voice commands and it sits dumbly on a shelf!   In all, this is a ***** of ***** - well worth the money for tickets at the theater!   ***** Buying a new 32" Sony TV  and  a PS2 in the same week.  **** Playing PS2 on a 25" Sony - Jeff...  *** Having a really small 25" Sony TV  ** Not having a Sony TV at all  * Being the last guy in the world to buy both a Sony TV and PS2

      Tonight I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of The Bourne&nbsp;supremacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically the movie took off where the last left off.&nbsp;   A quick synopsis: Jason Bourne is finally living a good life with Marie,&nbsp;his girlfriend from the last&nbsp;movie.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden all hell breaks loose.&nbsp; I can't go into much detail because it would spoil the movie.&nbsp; This was&nbsp;great movie.&nbsp; Not necessarily Oscar material but&nbsp;definitely worth paying the money to see it in&nbsp;the theatre.&nbsp; I can say that all the characters who survived the first movie&nbsp;return for this one.....and all of them don't&nbsp;survive the second.&nbsp; There a few excellent car chases and hand to hand combat.&nbsp; It gets a few marks for cheese in a couple of spots but all in all a&nbsp;great movie.&nbsp;   Its just a shame that Ben Affleck isn't as convincing&nbsp; an action hero ie.

      Well - it's the three of us...  &nbsp;  And to date, there's only eight posts, with sporadic comments throughout...  &nbsp;  I'm a bit disappointed in you guys...I picked what I thought were the best and brightest guys that I knew at the art of fuck-offery...it appears that you've got better things to do with your time than watch (and blast) movies...  &nbsp;  Sigh...I hate it when you guys get your priorities screwed up...  &nbsp;  I'll expect better in the future. I'm seeing "I, Robot" tonight, and Jeff's going to see "The Bourne Supremacy," so that's at least a couple of more posts.  &nbsp;  Just as an FYI,&nbsp; the movies that we talk about here aren't necessarily only those that are the newest movies - Kurt, I know that you've got a shitload of movies in your head that you could write about...plus, it's ok to just put random thoughts and/or jabs on this blog as well; it's always a good pick-me-up!&nbsp; &nbsp;  Talk 'atcha!

        This is the odd story of a grieving mother, a terminally-ill man and a born-again convict that are all brought together by a unnerving accident.  &nbsp;  The cinematography in this movie is a bit disturbing, as it all comes at you out of order - it seems to start at the end, jumps to the beginning and then goes all over the place during the movie.  &nbsp;  This movie stars   urlLink  Sean Penn    - whom I particularly hate as an individual, but I think he's a decent actor - as the terminally ill man. He finds himself in need of a heart transplant; one that is granted to him after   urlLink  Benicio Del Toro    (tell me he doesn't look like Brad Pitt after being rode hard and put away wet in prison for a few years!) runs over a father and his two daughters with his huge pick-up truck.   urlLink  Penn    becomes obsessed with finding the donor of his new heart. After finding the truth,   urlLink  Naomi Watts    (who's pretty friggin' hot)&nbsp;convinces   urlLink  Penn    to kill   urlLink  Del Toro    in a vendetta to somehow justify the death of the father and daughters.  &nbsp;  In all, it's not a bad story - albeit REALLY depressing. The acting was ok, but not great - but, as an upside - there's breasticles (  urlLink  Naomi Watts   ') EVERYWHERE (which always serves to make a crappy movie at least tolerable!).  &nbsp;  In all, I give this one **.  &nbsp;  Legend:  ***** As good as rubbing out a number three to thoughts of your wife's hot sister (or cousin).  **** About as good as a number three to the Paris Hilton video - she's been done.  *** Sex with your own wife (just kidding, honey!)      ** A number three to phone sex - you just know it's some trailer-trash fat broad on the other side; but it gets the job done.&nbsp;    * A thought of Michael Jackson during sex of any kind - that's a piece of your brain you'll never get back.

      How does Billy Bob Thorton not get an Oscar for this?  &nbsp;  He is funnier than a African-American dwarf with the mouth of a sailor.  He is funnier than a kid with a gallon of snot running out of his nose.&nbsp;  He is funnier than Bernie Mac. (but only by a little)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Santa is a drunken lowlife named Willie who cracks safes for a living. He teams yearly with Marcus the dwarf (Tony Cox), and together they rob Derpartment stores which they infiltrate as Santa and his elf.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  That's&nbsp;all the synopsis you need. This&nbsp;is a very dark look at the depths of human depravity with a sidenote about redemption.  &nbsp;  But mostly its the depravity.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Willie is&nbsp;to scumbags, as&nbsp;Elton John is&nbsp;to flamboyant homosexuals...&nbsp;he&nbsp;raises the bar for assholes everywhere.&nbsp;As you double over with laughter,&nbsp;you have to realize that your laughing at a depiction of the most miserable man on the face of the planet.  &nbsp;  That made me laugh even harder.  &nbsp;  This film has it all... dwarves being punched in the nuts, urine, tons of anal sex jokes/references/depictions, and a woman screaming "Fuck Me Santa!" over and over and over...

      It's the first one without Kirsten Dunst in a wet T-shirt.  Molina was neither convincing nor threatening as Dr. Octopus (I REFUSE to call him Doc Ock.)  The "transformation" of Otto Octavius to Dr. Octopus was an R-rated scene in a PG movie (giving it the PG-13).So don't take young kids to this movie unless you want them sleeping in your bed. (Pervert)  The acting (McGuire, Dunst, that guy from "Freaks and Geeks", et al.) hasn't gotten worse, but the story and pacing aren't any better than the first film.   The violence and the special effects were much better this time around.  Question: How do you not tip over if the 4 evil mechanical arms your wearing are heavy enough to shake the ground when you walk on them? Answer: Take a percent of the Opening weekend Box Office and put it in your front pocket.  When all is said and done, this was a fun summer film. I give it ***.  Legend: ***** Don't you dare freakin' miss this one! **** I dig it! *** Ehhh... ** Don't waste your money, wait for it on NetFlix. * Stab your eyes out with pencils rather than see this movie.

      A plucky story about a group of miscreants who need to drum up some cash to save a failing gym called "Average Joes". They decide to join a... Wait for it... dodgeball league. Opposing them at every turn is the obnoxious owner (Ben Stiller) of "Globo Gym". Peter La Fleaur, played by the peerless Vince Vaughn, is the owner of Average Joes and the team he assembles must face great adversity and Blah, Blah, Blah.  Okay... here's the deal. This is a funny motherhucker. It's getting a lot of heat as being juvenile across the net, but if you watch a movie called "Dodgeball" expect some slapstick, assface.   Some of the best moments are provided by "Steve the Pirate", played by Alan Tudyk, but Stephen Root (Milton from Office Space) should not be denied his genius as Gordon. Ben Stiller's groin-waving performance as White Goodman is funny but in the end he's rehashing his Mr. Furious character from Mystery Men. His awkward, egotistical, ranting is funny enough but it begins to grate on your nerves by the end of the movie. The scene-stealer here is Rip Torn, who time and again proves that he is more capably funny than Vaughn.  A stellar cameo by Hank Azaria rounds out the ensemble.  The Dodgeball teams at the Vegas tournament are incredibly funny with each team being themed. For example, there is a team all dressed as Mimes. Who doesn't like seeing Mimes get creamed?  All-in-all, I laughed out loud at least 10 times during this movie, a rare feat in this modern age of "Along Came Polly", so I have to give this one: ****.   Legend: ***** Go to this film now. Seriously, get off your ass. **** Worth the fines to steal it from Blockbuster. *** Ehhh... ** Like having sex with a corpse...only slightly fulfilling

      One word: Holy Crap!  This is a GREAT movie!!   A young man (Ashton Kutcher) is struggling to get over harmful memories from his childhood, but while doing so discovers a technique that allows him to travel back in time and occupy his childhood body changing his history forever. However he also discovers that every change he makes some how alters his future.  It's like Back to the Future, but a lot less corny! This guy goes back in time several times and only ends up screwing things up worse in the present. This movie is DARK - and Ashton Kutcher does a great job in his role, which is a bit of a change for him (there's no comedy in this flick).   There's a great twist at the end, and I never saw it coming!!  I'll give this one a *****, if you like dark thrillers. You have been warned!  Legend: ***** Don't you dare freakin' miss this one! **** I dig it! *** Ehhh... ** Don't waste your money, wait for it on NetFlix. * Stab your eyes out with pencils rather than see this movie.

      You Got Served follows the competitive world of street dancing where crews battle each other for money and respect. Elgin (Marques Houston of IMX) and David (Omarion of B2K) are best friends and leaders of the best dance crew in the area. When another town's top group challenges them to a battle, David and Elgin, along with their buddies (Raz B, J Boog and Lil' Fizz of B2K) must create and perfect the most cutting edge moves in order to remain on top. The stakes are raised as friends double-cross each other and true motives are revealed. When the biggest battle comes to town, David and Elgin must work past their differences to prove that they are still the best crew on the streets.   Ok, I'll be honest - I took that synopsis from the movie's website; mostly because I couldn't stomach the bad acting throughout the hour that I did watch the movie! The acting in this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen (with the possible exception of Vin Deisel, "Braaaaaahhhh..."). It had some decent dance moves, and some hot chicks, but Steve Harvey is this movie's only redeeming quality. He's got a few funny one-liners; but he's not a main character in the story.  This one gets a *.

      A major gun manufacturer is on trial after a woman loses her husband in a tragic killing spree initiated by a disgruntled employee who was sacked from the offices where he (the woman's husband) worked.  Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman) is a veteran lawyer who impassionately decides to defend the widow. Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman), on the other hand, has been hired by the gun company to manipulate the jury by digging up dirt on them and swaying them more towards a not guilty verdict. But, on the outside,juror Nicholas Easter (John Cusack) and his girlfriend Marlee (Rachel Weiez) are setting the wheels in motion for a plan of their own, with their own hidden agenda to work on.  Runaway Jury is a film that is potentially interesting, with a script that has undeniable sparkle for it's vast majority. Unfortunately, it's equally riddled with implausibilities and, for it all, is a strangely boring and uninvolving experience, and is slumberously paced. The long anticipated collaboration of screen legends Hoffman and Hackman (ultimately boiling down to just one scene in a men's toilets) fails to pay off.  I'll give this one ***.  Legend:  ***** Don't you dare freakin' miss this one! **** I dig it! *** Ehhh... ** Don't waste your money, wait for it on NetFlix. * Stab your eyes out with pencils rather than see this movie.

      This movie is so funny. Its the last real installment to the series of movies by Kevin Smith, he also wrote and directed, Mall Rats, Chasing Amy, Clerks, Dogma, and then this one.(I know he also did Jersey Girl but come on!)  Snoochi Boochi's!!!!! This movie is freaking hilarious. Basically the movie is a 90 minutes fart, sex, and weed joke. It has suspense, drama, action. Everything. The movie is about Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith. The find out that a movie is being made about a comic book that is based on their likeness. So they make the long trek from Jersey to Hollywood to get their mutherfuckin movie check! Throughout the journey they meet up with so many cameos that I can mention them all. Some of them worth mentioning is George Carlin, who plays a dick sucking hitchhiker. Carrie Fisher, who plays a nun. Seann Williams Scott, who plays a hilarious animal right activist, and Mark Hammil, who plays Cock-Knocker....you just have to watch. There is a band of female jewel thieves played by Shannon Elizabeth, Ali Larter, Eliza Dushku, and I don't know the other ones name but she's Kevin Smiths wife and she is hott. If you get the dvd and watch the deleted scenes you can see those girl in hott lesbo action. It wasn't in the movie because of a stupid activist group that will remain nameless, but their initials are G.L.A.A.D. You have to see this movie. I give it ****.  LEGEND ***** Watching Ali Larter and the other girl make out. **** Watching Ali Larter and the other girl dry hump. *** Seeing Ali Larter, Shannon Elizabeth, Eliza Dushku in a super tight black leather suit. ** Seeing Costa in the same suit. * Ben Affleck.

      No come on. Don't start already. This movie is the shiz. I have loved this movie ever since I was a little kid. I don't know what it is because its really not that good by most standards. How can you go wrong with a motown version of "The Last Dragon"?  The movie is about a guy named Bruce LeRoy, played by Taimak, and his quest to find "the glow". "The glow" is a special little something that only a true martial arts master can get...once you have become a master. Along the way he encounters strange characters, a crazy music promoter, a very hott v-jay, played by Vanity, and the villain of all villains..........Sho Nuff'- the shogun of Harlem! I don't care what you say Sho is the man. Sho Nuff is played by Julius Carry III. Such a great job. This movie is filled to the brim with awesome martial arts fighting, while in the background a kicking motown soundtrack including the 80's hit "Rhythm of the Night" sung by De'Barge. This movie really has it all. Again to no surprise I give it ****.  LEGEND ***** Seeing Vanity in her 1990's playboy spread. **** Receiving "The Glow". *** Being 10 years old and actually thinking the glow is real......fuck you! ** Wishing you had the fore-knowledge to know that if you did this movie it would ruin your acting career. * Coming to the realization that getting the part as the "bartender" on 90210 is going to be the height of you post "Last Dragon" career.

      Hooo-rah!  This one was a good flick that I'd forgotten about.  Sigorney Weaver plays a criminal pshycologist who's agoraphobic - she hasn't been outside her home in over a year. So, the hotness of Holly Hunter plays a homicide detective who's tracking what appears to be three different sets of serial murders. With the help of Weaver, they discover that what they have is the brightest kind of serial killer; a copycat.  There is some brutal violence in this flick, it's a bit gorey, and in a couple of spots, I even jumped a bit.  In the end, Holly Hunter ends up saving Sigorney Weaver's life (although, I like her movies a lot better when she dies in the end) by shooting the guy three times with a .45...man there's just something about a little chick with a big gun...  In all, ***.  Legend: ***** Holly Hunter nekkid shooting a .45 **** Holly Hunter nekkid. *** Sigorney Weaver nekkid - they're still tits! ** Brackman nekkid. * Me nekkid.

      All right, I admit it, I watched Demolition Man. What do you want - 200 channels of cable, and there was nothing else on!  Sly Stallone does his usual, although he did have a couple of funny moments in this one - particularly when he explains to Sandra Bullock the  hunka chunka, horizontal momba, boning.   Stallone plays a cop from the 20th century who was cryogenically frozen for some crimes - namely killing people in search of - enter stage left - Wesley Snipes. See Snipes plays an uber-criminal who's now been brainwashed to kill a man who could ultimately ruin the "perfect" future. Sandra Bullock is a 21st century cop who is obssessed with the 20th century, and with Stallone, in particular.  Dennis Leary ROCKS! Here's his little speech from Demolition Man: "You see, according to Cocteau's plan I'm the enemy, because I like to think...I like to read. I'm into freedom of speech...freedom of choice. I'm the kind of guy who'd walk into a greasy spoon and wonder -- "Gee, should I have the T-bone steak or the jumbo rack of barbecued ribs with the side order of gravy fries?" I WANT high cholesterol. I wanna eat bacon and butter and BUCKETS of cheese, okay? I want to smoke Cuban cigars the size of Cincinnati in the non-smoking section. I want to run through the streets naked with green jello all over my body, reading Playboy magazine. Why? Because I suddenly might feel the urge to, okay, pal? I've SEEN the future. Do you know what it is? It's a 47-year-old virgin sitting around in his beige pajamas, drinking a banana-broccoli shake, and singing "I'm an Oscar Meyer Wiener. You stay up there, you live by Cockteau's rules, how he wants, when he wants, what he wants. Your other option? Come down here, maybe starve to death."  So, that's the basics, in all, I give this one ***.  Legend: ***** Having 20th century sex with Sandra Bullock. **** Having cyber-sex with Sandra Bullock. *** Cyber-sex with someone who calls themselves Sandra Bullock. ** Seeing Dennis Leary nailing Sandra Bullock. * Figuring out that the someone who calls themselves Sandra Bullock is actually Kurt.

      Tom Berenger plays Marine Corps ace-sniper Tom Beckett. Beckett is sent in to eliminate a rebel general in Panama who is, according to intelligence, looking to disrupt the upcoming elections in Panama. Beckett gets saddled with a CIA agent who's a former SWAT-Sniper with no kills, Richard Miller (Billy Zane).  There's some cool camera shots, including Beckett shooting a Panamanian sniper in the eye, but only after the bullet passes through the scope of the Panamanian's rifle.  Some of the events of this movie were inspired by a real-life guy: Marine Corps Master Gunnery sergeant Carlos N. Hathcock, who had 93 confirmed kills during the Vietnam engagement.  You can find more information  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  Unfortunately, no matter how much I really enjoyed this movie (again), I can't give it more than *** - after all, Tom Berenger and Billy Zane? It's about as good as Sly Stallone and Vin Diesel...  Legend: ***** Confirmed kill at 2500 meters (Carlos' personal record). For those of you not so good at math, that's a mile and a half.  **** Having and being able to shoot decently with a .300 Winchester *** Being able to shoot all day, everyday. ** Tom Berenger's acting skills. * About how Billy Zane felt after not nailing "The Surgeon" the first time through.

      One word.....Trippy!!!!!! This movie is one of the trippiest movies I have ever seen. One trip after another, it never stops. You never know what's a trip and what's real.  This movie is based on the book by the same name, written by Hunter S. Thompson. It has two main characters, Raoul Drake, played by Johnny Depp and Dr. Gonzo, played by Benicio Del Toro. In real life these are two nicknames that he goes by.........Anyway. The movie is about these two characters taken a trip to Las Vegas to write about a motorcycle race. Instead they consume every kind of drug known, and not known, to man. It is really weird. It goes from LA to the desert, to Vegas, to the desert, back to Vegas. Anyone who like to insult there senses needs to see this movie. There are a bunch of funny cameos, just a few of them are- Tobey Maguire plays a hippy hitchhiker. Christina Ricci plays a acid tripping artist who only paints portraits of Barbara Striesand. Gary Busey plays a highway patrolman. Cameron Diaz plays a uber-hott TV reporter, and Hunter S. Thompson himself plays a random gambler. Although this movie came out in 1998 there wasn't a whole lot of hoopla about it. If your looking for a funky movie to veg out on this is it. It is just crazy. You will see these actors in ways that you never have before. You really have to look hard to recognize Del Toro as he put on 40+ pounds to be the obese Samoan lawyer. I heard from someone that if you watch the movie under the influence that its even better. It should be no surprise I give this movie ****.  LEGEND ***** Being able to see Cameron Diaz anytime you want, or at least someone who looks like her..... oh wait!  **** Talking to Bob.  *** Although I never tried acid, seeing what Vegas looks like through someone's eyes who has.  ** Saying something to your friends wife over the phone as a joke, only to realize that you really hurt her feelings, and feeling like shit the rest of the night..  * Insert comment here.....

      My wife hates me. She added this one to the top of our NetFlix queue - just to spite me.  Here's the deal: A school social studies assignment leads to social changes that spread from city-to-city. Assigned to come up with some idea that will improve mankind, a young boy ( urlLink Haley Joel Osment ) decides that if he can do three good deeds for someone and they in turn can "pay it forward" and so forth, positive changes can occur. What appears to initially be a failure, is indeed a success that is not immediately known but is traced backwards by a reporter who is a benefactor. The initial recipients of the boy are a drug addict ( urlLink James Cavaziel ), his badly scarred school teacher ( urlLink Kevin Spacey ), and his alcoholic mother ( urlLink Helen Hunt ). While physically and mentally scarred by past events, the teacher is not the only one bearing scars. The young boy fears his mother's fate, particularly at his brutal, alcoholic father's ( urlLink Jon Bon Jovi ) hands. The mother also bears scars from her childhood with a homeless, alcoholic mother ( urlLink Angie Dickinson ).  Yes, the movie had a decent story line - but Helen Hunt's only saving grace are her looks, she certainly can't act. Although she certainly did a decent job looking like she was enjoying the little lap dance she did! Kevin Spacey plays a decent role - only slightly less gay than he's played in the past. I think Keven's best character was in  The Usual Suspects.   Haley - well, it's Haley. He plays the little do-gooder that I love to hate.  In all, this one gets a **.  Legend: ***** Helen Hunt and Natalie Portman doing a lesbo scene. **** Helen Hunt doing a lap dance for you. *** Helen Hunt naked. ** Kevin Spacey naked. * Kevin Spacey and Jay Mohr doing a gay scene. Thanks, guys. That's a piece of my brain I'll never get back.

      "Equilibrium" truly gives "The Matrix" a run for its money. It may not be as revolutionary, and it was certainly made on very limited coffers (in film terms, that is, with a budget of about twenty million dollars), but this movie nonetheless has it all: heart, soul, brains, and more than its fair share of visceral action. It is this combination of the dramatic, the cerebral, and the intense that makes "Equilibrium" one of the best action films of its kind, and one of the very best films released in 2002 (though Dimension, for whatever reason, opted for a limited release, which may be why you've never heard of it up until now).  The always versatile and vastly talented Christian Bale plays John Preston, an emotionless enforcer (or Cleric) who arrests, and more often murders, those known as "Sense Offenders" - people who refuse to obey the laws of the futuristic regime, which has made illegal all forms of artistic expression, and even emotion itself. Emotion is regulated by daily drug use, and those who refuse to indulge are summarily executed. But when Preston kills his partner (played by Sean Bean, who so effortlessly portrayed Boromir in "The Lord of the Rings") for displaying unusual sentiment and misses his own required inducement of the emotion-quelling drug, he realizes that perhaps he is fighting for the wrong team.  "Equilibrium" feels like John Woo's take on "Fahrenheit 451" or "Brave New World," and it's absolutely astounding. Though at times "Equilibrium" may be guilty of mimicking "The Matrix," it sometimes outshines its forebear, and is every bit as compelling, its world every bit as believable (if not more so). Like "The Matrix," "Equilibrium" makes a powerful statement, and despite its splendidly choreographed action segments (which are revolutionary in their own right), it is a film with brains and brawn alike, and should not be missed. At last, despite all of its immitators, "The Matrix" has a worthy adversary in the genre.
