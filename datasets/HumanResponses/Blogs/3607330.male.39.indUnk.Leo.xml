      About-Face on North Korea: Allies Helped By DAVID E. SANGER  ASHINGTON, June 23 — President Bush's concrete offer to cajole North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program is a turning point for an administration previously caught between two conflicting approaches to one of the world's most isolated, impoverished and dangerous nations.  One camp, encompassing many in the Pentagon and Vice President Dick Cheney's office, has argued for further isolating North Korea's government and pressing for its collapse. Another, rooted in the State Department and some corners of the National Security Council, has said that Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, should be put to the test, given a serious offer that lays out what kind of benefits would flow if he gave up an expanding nuclear program. For now, that camp has won the day.  Mr. Bush selected his course because he had little choice: his Asian allies, picking up signals that the government of Mr. Kim may finally be willing to make a deal, were quietly beginning to negotiate a separate peace.  But perhaps as notable as Mr. Bush's turnabout is what it is missing: the kind of threats that surrounded his confrontation with Saddam Hussein last year. Though American intelligence agencies have warned Mr. Bush that North Korea is probably putting the finishing touches on six or more nuclear weapons, the president has sounded almost no public warnings about the threat the country poses, or given voice to the fear that it could sell its excess nuclear technology to terrorists or other states. While the administration's offer of assistance carries a three-month expiration date, the proposal sets no enforcement deadlines for North Korea to disarm.  There is no echo of the threat repeated so often prior to the Iraq war, no suggestion that if North Korea refuses to disarm, Mr. Bush will lead an alliance to make it disarm. There is no appetite in Asia or in the White House for such a risk, and the North Koreans know that.  Mr. Bush's senior advisers have insisted all along that the Korean challenge requires a very different strategy. They acknowledge that there are no good military options if North Korea chooses to keep making weapons — only the threat of more of the isolation the country has suffered but survived for half a century.  But in private, some officials also acknowledge that America's troubles in Iraq have changed the global politics of nuclear disarmament. For the benefit of this country's allies, they said, Mr. Bush had to come up with a serious offer — even one laden with conditions for full disclosure, full dismantlement and full inspections that they expect North Korea will reject.  "My hunch is that it's going to be very hard to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons," no matter how good the offer, said Kurt Campbell, a former senior Pentagon official during the Clinton administration. He was speaking at a conference on proliferation challenges that was taking place here just as the administration was changing course. "But we need to try," he said, "because if things get unpleasant, we will need to demonstrate to the allies that the diplomatic effort was serious."  Mr. Bush appears to have been pushed by those allies, at least according to the accounts offered up by Asian officials — and confirmed by some but not all — of their American counterparts.  For months, diplomats from China, Japan and South Korea have worried that the talks with North Korea were going nowhere, and they have described Mr. Kim and Mr. Bush as equally stubborn.  In meeting after meeting, North Korea would not engage seriously in talks until it knew exactly what kind of benefits it would receive for giving up its only claim to power, and its only leverage. For his part of the long stalemate, Mr. Bush refused to give in to what he once called "nuclear blackmail."  But by this spring, pressure on the White House had risen. A group of American visitors to North Korea's main nuclear complex reported that 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods — all placed under seal by the International Atomic Energy Agency before its inspectors were expelled 18 months ago — were gone. American intelligence agencies, while disagreeing about the details, concluded that most or all had been converted to bomb fuel, if not actual weapons.  "You could argue about the numbers," said Robert L. Gallucci, the chief American negotiator for the 1994 nuclear accord with North Korea that the Bush administration dismisses as a flawed start, "but not the direction."  South Korea, pressing to engage North Korea, began negotiating aid packages and military agreements. China reportedly paid North Korea millions of dollars just to come to the negotiating table, and publicly began questioning the validity of some of Washington's intelligence about North Korea's second nuclear program. That program was created with help from the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan.  And Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was beginning to charge that Mr. Bush had made America significantly less safe by ignoring the growing North Korean arsenal while it was focused on Iraq. "That was noticed in the White House," one senior State Department official said.  The turning point came in the past two weeks. Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, returned from a meeting with Mr. Kim, whom he had paid handsomely for releasing the relatives of Japanese kidnapped by North Korea years ago.  "I told him face to face, `If you compare what you gain from nuclear weapons and what you gain from dismantlement of your own nuclear program, there would be a difference of heaven and earth,' " Mr. Koizumi told reporters later. At the summit meeting at Sea Island, Ga., earlier this month, Mr. Koizumi told Mr. Bush that he felt the North Korean leader might be serious about making a deal.  Mr. Bush's critics say he waited far too long to make his offer; Mr. Kerry argues it should have happened early in 2001, and others say right after the American invasion of Iraq. Hawks inside the administration believe it is still too early.  But China, Russia, South Korea and Japan said they were willing to provide North Korea with fuel oil, which the United States cut off a year and a half ago, forcing Mr. Bush's hand.  The question now is whether the North Koreans will decide to await the outcome of the presidential election.  The American proposal will not end the old debates. A North Korean agreement to full disclosure and dismantlement, including giving up all fissile material, would prompt a "provisional" security guarantee promising that the United States and its allies harbor "no intention to invade or attack."  But that is different, some hawks are already arguing, than committing never to seek regime change inside a country run by a leader Mr. Bush once said he detested.

      Dick Cheney's Real Record Cheney Lied About WMDs And Hussein's Links to Al Qaeda  Cheney Said There Was "No Doubt" That Saddam Possessed WMDs. "Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction." [Dick Cheney, Speech to VFW, 8/26/03]  Cheney Said Hussein Had Ties to Al Qaeda. "But we also have to address the question of where might these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear weapons? And Saddam Hussein becomes a prime suspect in that regard because of his past track record and because we know he has, in fact, developed these kinds of capabilities, chemical and biological weapons. We know he's used chemical weapons. We know he's reconstituted these programs since the Gulf War. We know he's out trying once again to produce nuclear weapons and we know that he has a long-standing relationship with various terrorist groups, including the al-Qaeda organization." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 3/16/03]  Cheney: Ousting Saddam in 1991 Would "Not Have Been Easy" -- New Government Difficult to Establish. "There were ample reasons for the first President Bush not to go after Mr. Hussein. The current vice president and then the secretary of defense, Dick Cheney, outlined some of them in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1992, when he said: 'If we'd gone to Baghdad and got rid of Saddam Hussein -- assuming we could have found him -- we'd have had to put a lot of forces in and run him to ground someplace. He would not have been easy to capture. Then you've got to put a new government in his place, and then you're faced with the question of what kind of government are you going to establish in Iraq? Is it going to be a Kurdish government, or a Shia government or a Sunni government?' Mr. Cheney continued. 'How many forces are you going to have to leave there to keep it propped up, how many casualties are you going to take through the course of this operation?'" [New York Times, 12/16/03] Cheney Reaps Profits from Halliburton at the Expense of American Taxpayers and Troops  Halliburton Awarded No-Bid Rebuilding Contracts Worth Billions. In March 2003, the Pentagon awarded Halliburton's construction wing, Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR), a no-bid contract to help rebuild Iraqi oil fields after a possible war there, including advice on putting out oil well fires. The Army Corps of Engineers said that Halliburton's compensation for rejuvenating Iraq's oil industry could be up to $7 billion. [San Francisco Chronicle, 3/8/03; Ottawa Citizen, 3/7/03; Wall Street Journal, 3/7/03; New York Times, 4/11/03; Associated Press, 11/5/03]  Halliburton Gouged Gas Prices In Postwar Iraq At Expense Of American Taxpayers. The military investigated Halliburton and found that it overcharged for gas it imported into Iraq from Kuwait. US taxpayers and the United Nations oil-for-food program are paying Halliburton an average price of $2.64 per gallon, which is more than twice what others pay for Kuwait fuel. The appropriations bill that President Bush signed in November 2003 mandates that taxpayers subsidize all gas important costs beginning in 2004. Pentagon auditors have asked the Department of Defense to investigate Halliburton's activity in Kuwait, and in December the military ended its contract to with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root to import oil. [Reuters, 12/11/03; New York Times, 12/10/03; Associated Press, 11/5/03; Washington Post, 12/31/03, 1/16/04]  Halliburton Reaps Profits While Forcing Troops To Eat In Filthy Conditions. Halliburton's subsidiary Kellogg, Brown & Root [KBR] serves 110,000 soldiers in Iraq their meals. For that service, American taxpayers pay Halliburton "$28 per soldier per day." But, according to NBC News, "Pentagon inspections of mess halls run by KBR are finding a mess in some of them...In the main Baghdad dining facility where President Bush surprised the troops on Thanksgiving, inspectors found filthy kitchen conditions in each of the three previous months. Complaints filed in August, September and again in October report problems. Blood all over the floor of refrigerators, dirty pans, dirty grills, dirty salad bars, rotting meats and vegetables. In October, the inspector writes that Halliburton's previous promises to fix the problems have not been followed through and warns the company serious repercussions may result, due to improper handling and serving of food." [NBC News, 12/12/03] Cheney Proposed to Cut Defense Programs Vital to Recent Military Operations  Cheney Proposed Cutting F-16 Aircraft. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney said, "If you're going to have a smaller air force, you don't need as many F-16s...The F-16D we basically continue to buy and close it out because we're not going to have as big a force structure and we won't need as many F-16s." According to the Boston Globe, Bush's 1991 defense budget "kill[ed] 81 programs for potential savings of $ 11.9 billion...Major weapons killed include[d]....the Air Force's F-16 airplane." [Cheney testimony, House Armed Services Committee, 2/7/91; Boston Globe, 2/5/91]  Cheney Proposed Cuts to B-2 Program. According to the Boston Globe, in 1990, "Defense Secretary Richard Cheney announced a cutback... of nearly 45 percent in the administration's B-2 Stealth bomber program, from 132 airplanes to 75..." [Boston Globe, 4/27/90]  Cheney Proposed Cutting AH-64 Apaches. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, Cheney said, "This is just a list of some of the programs that I've recommended termination: the V-22 Osprey, the F-14D, the Army Helicopter Improvement Program, Phoenix missile, F-15E, the Apache helicopter, the M1 tank, et cetera." In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney said, "The Army, as I indicated in my earlier testimony, recommended to me that we keep a robust Apache helicopter program going forward, AH-64...I forced the Army to make choices...So I recommended that we cancel the AH-64 program two years out." [Cheney testimony, Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, 6/12/90; Cheney Testimony, House Armed Services Committee, 7/13/89, emphasis added]  Cheney Proposed Cutting M-1 Abrams Tanks. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, Cheney said, "This is just a list of some of the programs that I've recommended termination: the V-22 Osprey, the F-14D, the Army Helicopter Improvement Program, Phoenix missile, F-15E, the Apache helicopter, the M1 tank, et cetera." The Boston Globe reported on the impact of Cheney's cuts to armored tanks: "The Army's cupboard is left particularly bare. Coming in the wake of last year's killing of the M-1 tank and the Apache helicopter, the death of the M-2 means the Army will soon have virtually no major weapons in production." [Cheney testimony, Senate Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, 6/12/90; Boston Globe, 2/5/91]  Cheney Proposed Cutting B-52 Bombers. In 1990, Cheney proposed cutting 14 B-52 bombers. Cheney also sought the retirement of two Navy battleships, two nuclear cruisers, and eight nuclear-powered attack submarines. In 1991, Cheney scrapped the Navy's A-12 Stealth attack plane, a fighter that was proclaimed to be a key part of the future of navy aviation in advanced stealth technology. [Newsday, 2/5/91; NY Times, 1/8/91; Boston Globe, 4/27/90; Boston Globe, 1/30/90] Cheney's Record as Secretary of Defense Includes Cutting Troops and Bases  Cheney Cut Thousands of Active-Duty, Reserve, and Civilian Forces. In January 1990, Cheney banned the hiring of any new civilian personnel in the Defense Department through the end of September, which left more than 65,000 jobs vacant. Under the budget proposed in 1990, the Pentagon would have reduced active military personnel by 38,000; selected reserves would have fallen by 3,000. The budget called for the deactivation of two Army divisions. Long range, the Pentagon planned to reduce its work force by 300,000, including about 200,000 military personnel and 100,000 civilians. In 1991, he called for reduction of 200,000 active and reserve military personnel over two years. In 1992, Cheney called for cutting 500,000 active-duty people, 200,000 reservists, and 200,000 civilians over five years. [Minneapolis Star-Tribune, 2/2/92; Chicago Tribune, 2/20/91; 1990 CQ Almanac, p. 672; Washington Post, 1/13/90; Boston Globe, 1/30/90]  Active-Duty and Reserve Forces Endured Huge Reductions Under Cheney. The LA Times reported in November 1991 that the number of active-duty military personnel had decreased by over 106,000, or 5 percent of the total forces. The National Guard and Reserves had been cut by nearly 38,000, instead of the 105,000 the Bush Administration sought. [LA Times, 11/2/91]  Cheney Proposed Over 70 Base Closures. In 1990, Cheney proposed the closure of 72 domestic military installations and 12 overseas facilities. On April 12, 1991, Cheney proposed to close 31 major domestic military bases. The plan also called for shutting 12 smaller bases and reducing operations at 28 others. He submitted his list of closures to a commission on base closings on April 15, 1991. In 1992, Cheney proposed 70 overseas military base closures, three of which were in Turkey. [Aerospace Daily, 8/17/92; 1991 CQ Almanac, p. 427; Chicago Tribune, 1/30/90] Cheney Conducted Secret Energy Task Force Meetings Composed Largely of Energy Industry Officials  Cheney Chaired Nine Cabinet Level Meetings on Energy Task Force, Met With Enron Officials. Vice President Dick Cheney chaired nine meetings of the Cabinet-level Energy Task Force that Vice President Cheney chaired between January and May 2001. Each of the meetings lasted 90 minutes. According to Enron Spokesman Vance Meyer, during the course of the Energy Task Force meetings, there was a thirty minute meeting between Vice President Cheney, then Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay and "another executive." Cheney's Energy Task Force officials met with 118 energy industry or corporate groups, 13 environmental groups and 1 consumer group during meetings of the energy task force. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case on April 27, 2004. [Washington Post, 3/26/02, 5/17/01; New York Times, 5/10/01; 5/20/01; 4/25/04] Cheney Failed to Provide Body Armor for Troops in Iraq For More Than a Year  Cheney Admits One Year After Iraq War Began That Troops Lacked Body Armor. The war on Iraq commenced in March 2003. In an interview with Brit Hume of Fox News on March 17, 2004, one year later, Cheney said, "I believe the chief of staff of the Army and the vice chief -- vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs have testified recently that all of our troops in Iraq are now properly equipped with the newest body armor. So there were -- the main problem had been just the sheer capacity to produce these items early on." [Fox News Special Report with Brit Hume, 3/17/04]  Bush Administration Made At Least Five Separate Promises to Provide Body Armor; Despite Recent Claims, Some Troops Still Waiting. The Bush Administration first promised that all troops would be fully equipped with body armor by the end of November 2003. They continued to extend the deadline to the end of December, January, and then February, until they finally claimed in March 2004 that all troops were equipped with body armor. However, Major General Charles Swannack, commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, reported in March that, "We are still short a significant amount of vehicles, radios, and body armor to properly equip [soldiers]." The AP reported in late March, "Soldiers headed for Iraq are still buying their own body armor - and in many cases, their families are buying it for them - despite assurances from the military that the gear will be in hand before they're in harm's way." [House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, 9/24/03; UPI, 12/3/03; Hartford Courant, 1/11/04; House Appropriations Committee, Defense Subcommittee, 2/12/04; Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, 3/2/04; NY Daily News, 3/11/04; AP, 3/26/04] Cheney Has Failed to Keep Faith With Those Who Have Worn the Uniform  In 1981, Cheney Voted Against Raising Military Pay for Senior and Junior Enlisted Personnel. In 1981, Cheney voted against an amendment to increase the pay of senior enlisted personnel by 18-22 percent and the basic pay of junior enlisted personnel by 7-9 percent. The amendment was rejected 170-232. [1981 CQ Almanac, p.66-H, vote #192]  In 1982, Cheney Voted Against Authorizing Military Pay Raise. In 1982, Cheney voted against the "Uniformed Services Pay Act" which would have authorized a pay raise in FY 1983 for uniformed members of the armed services. The bill would have also restricted the hiring of private contractors to perform Department of Defense services. The vote was a motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The motion was rejected 214-186. [1982 CQ Almanac, p.98-H, vote #330]  As Congressman, Cheney Consistently Voted Against Veterans Administration Funding. In 1980, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988, Cheney was one of a small number of House members to passage of bills that provided funding for the Veterans Administration. In 1983, Cheney voted against bringing a bill to the House floor and paired against House passage of a bill that provided funding for the Veterans Administration. In 1981, Cheney was one of only 41 House members to vote against House passage of a bill that provided business loans and additional educational benefits to Vietnam veterans. In 1983, Cheney was one of only 30 House members to vote against House passage of a bill that would have provided $54 million for Agent Orange studies and $75 million for the Emergency Veterans Jobs Training Act.

Vice President Dick Cheney received five deferments during the Vietnam War from 1963 to 1966, a period of heightened American commitment in Vietnam. He later dismissed questions about his failure to serve by simply saying, "I had other priorities in the '60s." [McGrory, Washington Post, 7/27/00; Geyer, Chicago Tribune, 2/6/04; Arizona Republic, 1/22/04]  Cheney and Bush Campaign Distort Record of Cheney's Deferments. The Washington Post reported in 1991 that Cheney received five deferments, four 2-S student deferments and one under the 3-A classification -- "registrant with a child or children; or registrant deferred by reason of extreme hardship to dependents." In his Senate confirmation hearing, Cheney said he "would have obviously been happy to serve had I been called," which contradicting his earlier statement, "I had other priorities in the '60s than military service." Bush staff members said Cheney received only three deferments, two for school and one for being a new father. [Washington Post, 4/3/91; Des Moines Register, 8/2/00]

      June 20, 2004 New York Times FIGHTERS POUR IN Iraq Is a Hub for Terrorism, However You Define It By EDWARD WONG  AGHDAD, Iraq — A superpower invaded an impoverished Islamic nation. Guerrillas responded with AK-47's and rocket-propelled grenades. A generation of warriors was born, eager to wage jihad.  That was Afghanistan in the 1980's. It became a breeding ground for terrorists - most infamously Osama bin Laden - who exported their deadly skills throughout the world. In Iraq, some of the same conditions that nurtured terrorism in the mountains of Afghanistan have emerged in the power vacuum created by the American occupation, Iraqis and terrorism experts say.  "Unfortunately Iraq has become a cause célèbre for radical jihadists the way that Afghanistan did a decade and a half ago," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism analyst at the RAND Corporation. "You've got a lot of the same conditions that allowed Afghanistan to become a hub for terrorists."  Those include porous borders, swaths of lawless land and regions of the country harboring well-armed groups that are neither part of the government nor under its control, Mr. Hoffman said.  He defined terrorists in terms of tactics - using suicide car bombs rather than conventional weapons, for example. Since the civil war in Lebanon, the line between terrorism and insurgency has blurred, he said, with Iraq being a perfect example.  There has been an average of one car bomb a day this month. More than 100 civilians have been killed.  Assassinations of Iraqi government officials and sabotage of crucial sites like oil pipelines are on the rise. American and Iraqi forces seem unable to prevent the carnage, fueling hatred of the occupation among the population.  Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a spokesman for the occupation forces, said that reconstruction work like opening health clinics and renovating schools had brightened the lives of Iraqis. But "are we satisfied with the level of instability in this country right now?" he said. "Absolutely not."  Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq was subjected to a reign of terror, but terrorism did not exist here in the manner it does now.  An independent commission in Washington investigating the attacks of Sept. 11 reported last week that there was no evidence of a working relationship between Mr. Hussein and Al Qaeda, as the Bush administration had said in pressing its case for war.  The failure now to control borders has allowed foreign fighters to enter Iraq. Unguarded overland crossings exist between Iraq and its neighbors Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia, each of which has its share of radical Islamic groups.  Falah al-Naqib, the new Iraqi interior minister, said the suicide car bombs were a sign that foreign fighters had infiltrated Iraq, and that "some parties and countries want to demolish this country." He said Iraqis do not use such tactics. And he added that he "won't hesitate" to declare martial law if more deadly bombings take place.  Ahmed Hashim, a professor at the United States Naval War College who studies the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, also attributed much of the violence to the porous borders and the fact that the American presence has become a magnet for jihadists.  "I think terrorism has come to Iraq as a result of the war," he said. "The country has unpatrolled and open borders, so all kinds of extremists who want to fight America have an excellent playing field to do so now."  A senior American military official wrote in an e-mail message that the fighters enter through old smuggling routes that follow tribal connections. These are like the routes used by mujahedeen to enter Afghanistan.  "The U.S. military continues to see small numbers of foreign fighters coming through the porous borders of Syria and Saudi Arabia," the official wrote. "Financial support continues to come from Saudi Arabia through various financiers to terrorist networks and through Syria via couriers."  Inside Iraq, these forces find fertile ground. By deciding that Baath Party members could not participate in the rebuilding of Iraq, the Americans essentially dismantled much of the state without installing a suitable replacement. L. Paul Bremer III, the top civilian administrator here, disbanded the Iraqi Army, leaving behind a pool of disgruntled men trained in killing.  The new American-trained Iraqi security forces can often be ineffective, as demonstrated by the mass defections during the uprising in April. Just last Monday, Baghdad policemen stood by as Iraqis danced atop the charred vehicles of a convoy carrying foreign contractors that had been hit by a suicide car bomb.  Nadhim A. al-Jassour, a professor of international relations at the University of Baghdad, said that the American evisceration of the Iraqi state had taught Iraqis to disrespect the government, perpetuating the lawlessness.  "If you beat a father in front of his children, do you think the children will respect the father?" Professor Jassour said. "That's an insult. At the same time, you ask the father to carry out duties in his house."  The Sunni-dominated city of Falluja, 35 miles west of Baghdad, has become a safe haven for terrorists and insurgents. In late April, marines turned over control of the city to a militia composed partly of guerrillas. Since then, Falluja has become a mini-Islamist state, with all manner of anti-American fighters roaming the town.  While Iraq is not run by warlords, as Afghanistan has been, armed groups exist that do not answer to the government.  One of the largest is the Mahdi Army, led by Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who rallied a revolt against the occupation in April. Though Mr. Sadr called last week for his fighters to leave the holy cities of Najaf and Kufa, he did not commit to disbanding the militia.  A recent poll ordered by the Coalition Provisional Authority showed that a majority of Iraqis look up to Mr. Sadr. Last Sunday, he said through a spokesman that he wanted to start a political party.  As the United States occupation approaches its official end on June 30, many Iraqis say that the future will be defined by the legacy the Americans are leaving the interim government - the birth of terrorist and insurgent groups and the struggle to control them.

         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  June 16, 2004 Bush Policies a Failure, Ex-Diplomats Say By REUTERS   Filed at 4:40 p.m. ET  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Bush led the United States into an ill-planned Iraq war that has weakened U.S. security, retired diplomats and military officers said on Wednesday in a direct challenge to one of Bush's main arguments for re-election.  ``We all believe that current administration policies have failed in the primary responsibilities of preserving national security and providing world leadership,'' said a statement signed by the 27 retired officials. ``We need a change.''  The rare criticism by career officials came from a group that included members of both major political parties, a former CIA director, two former ambassadors to the Soviet Union and a retired chairman of the military Joint Chiefs of Staff.  In attacking Bush's national security record, they challenged a key Bush argument for his re-election against Democrat Sen. John Kerry, that the Iraq war has made America safer and that Bush is an effective wartime president.  ``Our security has been weakened,'' the group said.  The former officials, some of whom said they had voted for Bush in 2000, said the Republican president manipulated intelligence on Iraq to lead the United States into an ``ill-planned and costly war from which exit is uncertain.''  Bush has maintained an ``overbearing'' approach to foreign policy that relied excessively on military power, spurned the concerns of traditional U.S. allies and disdained the United Nations, the group said.  ``It justified the invasion of Iraq by manipulation of uncertain intelligence about weapons of mass destruction, and by a cynical campaign to persuade the public that Saddam Hussein was linked to al Qaeda and the attacks of September 11,'' it said. ``The evidence did not support this argument.''  ``Never in the two and a quarter centuries of our history has the United States been so isolated among the nations, so broadly feared and distrusted,'' it added.  State Department spokesman Richard Boucher denied the Bush administration had forsaken diplomacy in favor of force, said it won four unanimous Security Council resolutions on Iraq and sought to dismiss the group's stance as a ``political.''  ``As far as the facts of this administration's fight against terrorism with diplomatic, military, intelligence and law enforcement means ... This administration has a record that it is happy to stand on,'' he said.  The group, which included retired admiral Stansfield Turner who headed the Central Intelligence Agency under President Jimmy Carter, did not explicitly back Kerry in the Nov. 2 U.S. presidential election.  But several members made clear that they believed the Massachusetts Democrat would do a better job than the Republican incumbent.  Retired Gen. Tony McPeak, a former chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, said the Pentagon had only about half the troops in Iraq that were needed.  ``Because of the Pollyannaish assumptions that were made by the administration in going in there that bouquets would be thrown at us and so forth, we were totally unprepared for the post-combat occupation,'' said McPeak, who said he supported Bush in 2000 but was now advising Kerry.  Members also condemned Bush's Middle East policies and said claims Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction -- which have not been found -- had eroded U.S. credibility.

      COMMENTARY The Right Wing's Deep, Dark Secret Some hope for a Bush loss, and here's why. By John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, writers for the Economist, are co-authors of "The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America" (Penguin, 2004).  July 28, 2004  BOSTON — One of the secrets of conservative America is how often it has welcomed Republican defeats. In 1976, many conservatives saw the trouncing of the moderate Gerald Ford as a way of clearing the path for the ideologically pure Ronald Reagan in 1980. In November 1992, George H.W. Bush's defeat provoked celebrations not just in Little Rock, where the Clintonites danced around to Fleetwood Mac, but also in some corners of conservative America.   "Oh yeah, man, it was fabulous," recalled Tom DeLay, the hard-line congressman from Sugar Land, Texas, who had feared another "four years of misery" fighting the urge to cross his party's too-liberal leader. At the Heritage Foundation, a group of right-wingers called the Third Generation conducted a bizarre rite involving a plastic head of the deposed president on a platter decorated with blood-red crepe paper.   There is no chance that Republicans would welcome the son's defeat in the same way they rejoiced at the father's. George W. is much more conservative than George H.W., and he has gone out of his way to throw red meat to each faction of the right: tax cuts for the anti-government conservatives, opposition to gay marriage and abortion for the social conservatives and the invasion of Iraq for the neoconservatives. Still, there are five good reasons why, in a few years, some on the right might look on a John Kerry victory as a blessing in disguise.  First, President Bush hasn't been as conservative as some would like. Small-government types fume that he has increased discretionary government spending faster than Bill Clinton. Buchananite paleoconservatives, libertarians and Nelson Rockefeller-style internationalists are all furious — for their very different reasons — about Bush's "war of choice" in Iraq. Even some neocons are irritated by his conduct of that war — particularly his failure to supply enough troops to make the whole enterprise work.   The second reason conservatives might cheer a Bush defeat is to achieve a foreign policy victory. The Bush foreign policy team hardly lacks experience, but its reputation has been tainted — by infighting, by bungling in Iraq and by the rows with Europe. For better or worse, many conservatives may conclude that Kerry, who has accepted most of the main tenets of Bush's policy of preemption, stands a better chance than Bush of increasing international involvement in Iraq, of winning support for Washington's general war on terror and even of forcing reform at the United Nations. After all, could Jacques, Gerhard and the rest of those limp-wristed continentals say no to a man who speaks fluent French and German and has just rid the world of the Toxic Texan?   The third reason for the right to celebrate a Bush loss comes in one simple word: gridlock. Gridlock is a godsend to some conservatives — it's a proven way to stop government spending. A Kerry administration is much more likely to be gridlocked than a second Bush administration because the Republicans look sure to hang on to the House and have a better-than-even chance of keeping control of the Senate.   The fourth reason has to do with regeneration. Some conservatives think the Republican Party — and the wider conservative movement — needs to rediscover its identity. Is it a "small government" party, or does "big government conservatism" make sense? Is it the party of big business or of free markets? Under Bush, Western anti-government conservatives have generally lost ground to Southern social conservatives, and pragmatic internationalists have been outmaneuvered by neoconservative idealists. A period of bloodletting might help, returning a stronger party to the fray.   And that is the fifth reason why a few conservatives might welcome a November Bush-bashing: the certain belief that they will be back, better than ever, in 2008. The conservative movement has an impressive record of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Ford's demise indeed helped to power the Reagan landslide; "Poppy" Bush's defeat set up the Gingrich revolution. In four years, many conservatives believe, President Kerry could limp to destruction at the hands of somebody like Colorado Gov. Bill Owens.  When the British electorate buried President Bush's hero, Winston Churchill, and his Conservative Party, Lady Churchill stoically suggested the "blessing in disguise" idea to her husband. He replied that the disguise seemed pretty effective. Yet the next few years vindicated Lady Churchill's judgment. The Labor Party, working with Harry S. Truman, put into practice the anti-communist containment policies that Churchill had championed. So in 1951, the Conservative Party could return to office with an important piece of its agenda already in place and in a far fitter state than it had been six years earlier. It held office for the next 13 years.

      Obama: Time to reclaim America's promise   BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Barack Obama, who is running for the U.S. Senate from Illinois, gave the keynote speech Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention. This is a transcript of his remarks.  On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.  My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British.  But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.  While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas.  Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty, joined Patton's army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west, all the way to Hawaii, in search of opportunity.  And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents.  My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or "blessed," believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.  They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential.  They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride.  And I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters.  I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth, is my story even possible.  Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe. That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted -- or at least, most of the time.  This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations.  And fellow Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, Independents -- I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college.  Now don't get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to.  Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon.  Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.  People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice.  In this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry.  John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service, because they've defined his life. From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.  John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded. So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he'll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home.  John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves.  John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields.  John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us.  And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option.  You know, a while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6-2 or 6-3, clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week.  And as I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us?  I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists.  When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.  Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated.  John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.  John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we are all connected as one people.  If there's a child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child.  If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent.  If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties.  It is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief -- I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper -- that makes this country work.  It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. "E pluribus unum." Out of many, one.  Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.  Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America.  There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America -- there is the United States of America.  The pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states.  We coach Little League in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states.  There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it.  We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.  In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope?  John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here-the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it.  That's not what I'm talking [about]. I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.  Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope.  In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; a belief in things not seen; a belief that there are better days ahead.  I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.  I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair.  I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.  America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president. And John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president. And this country will reclaim its promise. And out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.  Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.

      &nbsp;  By ABBY GOODNOUGH IAMI, July 27 - Almost all the electronic records from the first widespread use of touch-screen voting in Miami-Dade County have been lost, stoking concerns that the machines are unreliable as the presidential election draws near.  The records disappeared after two computer system crashes last year, county elections officials said, leaving no audit trail for the 2002 gubernatorial primary. A citizens group uncovered the loss this month after requesting all audit data from that election.  A county official said a new backup system would prevent electronic voting data from being lost in the future. But members of the citizens group, the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition, said the malfunction underscored the vulnerability of electronic voting records and wiped out data that might have shed light on what problems, if any, still existed with touch-screen machines here. The group supplied the results of its request to The New York Times.  "This shows that unless we do something now - or it may very well be too late - Florida is headed toward being the next Florida," said Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, a lawyer who is the chairwoman of the coalition.  After the disputed 2000 presidential election eroded confidence in voting machines nationwide, and in South Florida in particular, the state moved quickly to adopt new technology, and in many places touch-screen machines. Voters in 15 Florida counties - covering more than half the state's electorate - will use the machines in November, but reports of mishaps and lost votes in smaller elections over the last two years have cast doubt on their reliability.  Like "black boxes" on airplanes, the electronic voting records on touch-screen machines list everything that happens from boot-up to shutdown, documenting in an "event log" when every ballot was cast. The records also include "vote image reports" that show for whom each ballot was cast. Elections officials have said that using this data for recounts is unnecessary because touch-screen machines do not allow human error. But several studies have suggested the machines themselves might err - for instance, by failing to record some votes.  After the 2002 primary, between Democratic candidates Janet Reno and Bill McBride, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida conducted a study that found that 8 percent of votes, or 1,544, were lost on touch-screen machines in 31 precincts in Miami-Dade County. The group considered that rate of what it called "lost votes" unusually high. Voting problems plagued Miami-Dade and Broward Counties on that day, when touch-screen machines took much longer than expected to boot up, dozens of polling places opened late and poorly trained poll workers turned on and shut down the machines incorrectly. A final vote tally - which narrowed the margin first reported between the two candidates by more than 3,000 votes - was delayed for a week.   Ms. Reno, who ultimately lost to Mr. McBride by just 4,794 votes statewide, considered requesting a recount at the time but decided against it.  Seth Kaplan, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade elections division, said on Tuesday that the office had put in place a daily backup procedure so that computer crashes would not wipe out audit records in the future.  The news of the lost data comes two months after Miami-Dade elections officials acknowledged a malfunction in the audit logs of touch-screen machines. The elections office first noticed the problem in spring 2003, but did not publicly discuss it until this past May.  The company that makes Miami-Dade's machines, Election Systems and Software of Omaha, Neb., has provided corrective software to all nine Florida counties that use its machines. One flaw occurred when the machines' batteries ran low and an error in the program that reported the problem caused corruption in the machine's event log, said Douglas W. Jones, a computer science professor at the University of Iowa whom Miami-Dade County hired to help solve the problem.  In a second flaw, the county's election system software was misreading the serial numbers of the voting machines whose batteries had run low, he said. The flaws would not have affected vote counts, he said - only the backup data used for audits after an election. And because a new state rule prohibits manual recounts in counties that use touch-screen voting machines except in the event of a natural disaster, there would likely be no use for the data anyway.  State officials have said that they created the rule because under state law, the only reason for a manual recount is to determine "voter intent" in close races when, for example, a voter appears to choose two presidential candidates or none.  Touch-screen machines, officials say, are programmed not to record two votes, and if no vote is recorded, they say, it means the voter did not cast one. But The Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, in a recent analysis of the March presidential primary, reported that voters in counties using touch-screen machines were six times as likely to record no vote as were voters in counties using optical-scan machines, which read markings on paper ballots.  The A.C.L.U. of Florida and several other voting rights groups have sued to overturn the recount rule, saying it creates unequal treatment of voters. Counties that use optical-scan machines can conduct recounts, though only in extremely close races.  Mr. Kaplan says that the system crashes had erased data from other elections besides Ms. Reno's, the most recent being municipal elections in November 2003. Under Florida law, ballot records from elections for state and local office need be kept for only a year. For federal races, the records must be kept for 22 months after an election is certified. It was not immediately clear what the consequences might be of breaching that law. Mr. Kaplan said the backup system was added last December. An August 2002 report from Miami-Dade County auditors to David Leahy, then the county elections supervisor, recommended that all data from touch-screen machines be backed up on CD's or elsewhere. Professor Jones said it was an obvious practice long considered essential in the corporate world.   "Any naïve observer who knows about computer system management and who knows there is a requirement that all the records be stored for a period of months," Professor Jones said, "would say you should obviously do that with computerized voting systems." Buddy Johnson, the elections supervisor in Hillsborough County, which is one of the state's largest counties and which also uses touch-screen machines, said his office still had its data from the 2002 elections on separate hard drives. Mr. Kaplan of the Miami-Dade elections office could not immediately explain on Tuesday afternoon the system crashes in 2003.  Martha Mahoney, a University of Miami law professor and member of the election reform group, said she requested the 2002 audit data because she had never heard an explanation of the supposedly lost votes that the A.C.L.U. documented after the Reno-McBride election.  "People can never be sure their vote was recorded the way it was cast, but these are the best records we've got," she said. "And now they're not there."

       The Bush Record: Top 10 Bush Flip Flops    1. Bush Flip-Flops on Independent 9/11 Commission    Bush Flip: Initially Opposed to Independent 9/11 CommissionBush opposed an independent inquiry into 9/11, arguing it would duplicate a probe conducted by Congress. In July 2002, his administration issued a "statement of policy" that read "...the Administration would oppose an amendment that would create a new commission to conduct a similar review [to Congress's investigation]." [Statement of Administration Policy, Executive Office of the President, 7/24/02; LA Times, 11/28/02]      Bush Flop: Bush Relented and Appointed Independent CommissionPresident Bush finally agreed to support an independent investigation into the 9/11 attacks after "the congressional committees unearthed more and more examples of intelligence lapses, the administration reversed its stance." [Los Angeles Times, 11/28/02]      2. Bush Flip-Flops on Independent WMD Commission    Bush Flip: Refuses to Call for Independent Bipartisan Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction"President Bush said on January 30, 2004, 'I want to know the facts' about any intelligence failures concerning Saddam Hussein's alleged cache of forbidden weapons but he declined to endorse calls for an independent investigation." [AP, 1/30/04]  Bush Flop: Bush Appoints WMD Investigation CommissionPresident Bush named a nine-member bipartisan commission to investigate U.S. intelligence-gathering capabilities in February 2004. The AP noted, "Bush had initially opposed a commission, but agreed to do so as calls grew from Republican lawmakers as well as Democrats." The Los Angeles Times reported, "The White House opposed that panel initially, then backed down under pressure, and some say administration officials now regret doing so because the administration has become locked in a series of embarrassing battles with the Sept. 11 commission."

      &nbsp;  By JAMES GLANZ AGHDAD, Iraq, July 25 - Rising security and other overhead costs of Western contractors are cutting into the billions of dollars set aside for some 90 planned water projects, allowing them to supply only half the potable water originally expected, Iraqi officials say. Scaling back the projects by that much would vastly reduce the benefits for the citizens of a country that already meets no more than 60 to 80 percent of the demand for water on a given day, depending on the region. The Iraqi government estimates may also have wider repercussions, because they provide the first concrete measure of how the continuing violence in Iraq could affect the $18.4 billion reconstruction program approved by Congress last fall. That program covers numerous infrastructure areas, including transportation, oil, electricity, sewage - and of course water, the sector covered by the Iraqi estimates. Over all, about $4.3 billion was set aside for water and public works, of which about $2.8 billion has been released so far. "A big chunk of that money is going to administration and security," said Nesreen Berwari, the minister of municipalities and public works, the sector of the Iraqi government that has responsibility for water projects outside Baghdad. "Everything we planned for, because of the budget limitations, what's available for construction is half," Ms. Berwari said. Steve Susens, a spokesman for the Project and Contracting Office, which is affiliated with both the Defense Department and the United States Embassy in Baghdad, said estimates for security costs and other overhead had risen somewhat since the first estimates on the size of the projects were made early this year, before the insurgency erupted. But he said the office and its contractors were seeking innovative ways of softening the impact of the rising costs, like seeking new donors or reworking the engineering designs. "There's no reason to dispute the figures," Mr. Susens said of the Iraqi calculations. He added that "security costs are the one thing we can't control. It's controlled by the enemy." Another official at the contracting office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the overall scope of the work was beyond what Iraqi companies, which would have far lower overhead costs but have little experience with billion-dollar projects, could handle - even though much of the construction work will actually be carried out by Iraqi subcontractors chosen by the Western companies. "If you compare it to what they've done in the past - in the past 20-some years - it exceeds anything they've done," the official said. The official also said some of the original Iraqi estimates might have been based on optimistic assumptions about what the American money could buy and that they did not take into account potential measures like combining several projects that are close to one another in order to save money and increase capacity. But Keith Ashdown, who as vice president for planning at Taxpayers for Common Sense in Washington has studied contracting in Iraq, said it was "shocking in the extreme that we're basically cutting our efforts on these projects because of administrative and security costs." "We're going to get more bang for our buck in project performance when we get Iraqis doing the work - not just subcontracting the work but actually managing the work themselves," Mr. Ashdown said. The projected reduction was described by officials in the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works, who based their estimates on detailed calculations for four major projects totaling about $234 million. The Iraqi officials said that delays, often unexplained by the Americans and lasting as long as six months, had kept many of the approximately 90 new projects from moving much beyond the planning stage. Those four - in the northern cities of Halabja, Erbil and Baquba and the southern city of Nasiriya - are among the furthest along in their design. Halabja is infamous as the Kurdish town that Saddam Hussein's government gassed in 1988, killing thousands. Erbil is a historic town that is also in Kurdish territory, while Baquba is a city just north of Baghdad that has been continually racked by violence. Nasiriya has suffered only minor disturbances since the American-led invasion last year. Iraqi engineers had originally estimated that those four projects alone would provide about 235 million gallons of potable water a day for about 1.7 million people. But after security and other costs for the Western companies were factored in, the number of gallons they could be expected to supply dropped to about 118 million a day. An official in the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works who is intimately familiar with the numbers confirmed that most of the extra costs come about because the prime contractors are Western. Western companies typically hire large numbers of private security guards, set up elaborate base camps and travel only in heavily guarded convoys, offer much higher salaries than Iraqi companies, pay skyrocketing insurance premiums and require much more administrative support in order to comply with stringent American regulations. Together, those items averaged 25 percent of the entire contract, the official said. But as with most construction projects that require capital-intensive items - in this case, miles of soft iron pipe, expensive pumps and other hardware - the cuts will have a disproportionate effect, reducing the ultimate capacity by half. There has also been talk of eliminating some projects in order to pay for others, but the ministry has resisted such suggestions, saying that all of the work is critical in a nation suffering from water shortages. Ministry officials say that American officials have also pressed to scale back projects on the argument that they could be designed to cover short-term needs in certain parts of the country, and be expanded in the future when more money is available. The normal procedure for such expensive projects is to design them to cover needs for the next two to three decades, said Mahmood A. Ahmed, the ministry's director general for water. But he said that in the Western companies' estimates of the costs, "there is a security part; this is very sensitive for them." Mr. Ahmed expressed gratitude that the United States was spending so much money in the first place and said that even if the projects have to be cut by half, "it's better than nothing for now." But Mr. Ahmed also described an American reconstruction program in the throes of lengthy delays. He said that after early estimates for the projects were made last February, the ministry was forced to wait for months while the Americans ground through their contracting procedures. "If you give us the money in the beginning of this year, in January or February, I think now we will be finished," Mr. Ahmed said. Officials at the contracting office disputed that assertion, saying that the time was required to go through the normal process of assuring that American taxpayer money is being spent responsibly. Mr. Susens called the reconstruction an enormous task and called to mind the length of time it has taken to carry out the Big Dig in downtown Boston - except that there are some 2,300 different projects to carry out in Iraq. "As far as construction projects," Mr. Susens said, "these are like lightning." Many of the new water projects have been contracted to a joint venture of major American and British contractors and named Fluor-Amec. Other companies that have received major contracts in the general area of water resources are Washington International Group and Black and Veatch. Mr. Ahmed leveled severe criticisms at Bechtel, a company that received some $500 million in earlier government contracts for water work through the United States Agency for International Development. Mr. Ahmed said that Bechtel failed to consult with the ministry in everything from its choice of Iraqi contractors to its decisions of when and how to undertake major repairs of water systems, especially in the parched south of the country. As a result, Mr. Ahmed said, Bechtel has done business with shady contractors and is now in the middle of repair projects, reducing water supplies during the peak demand of summer - something he said Iraqi companies would know should be avoided. "American companies, they don't know the criteria of projects in Iraq," Mr. Ahmed said. But Greg Pruett, a spokesman for Bechtel, said that the company was being as flexible as it could in accommodating requests from the ministries in carrying out projects. He said that the company was constantly grappling with the security situation in Iraq, adding that "if that means that a project is not going to proceed as quickly as we would like it, then we're going to accept a slowing of the project to ensure the safety of our workers." A press officer for the development agency, Steve Tupper, said that Iraqi companies did not generally have the ability to comply with American rules on accountability and transparency in the use of public funds. Under pressure from the citizenry, Iraqi officials "want quick fixes," Mr. Tupper said. "But quick fixes won't work," he said. "Without proper installation and regular maintenance you'll end up with the same deteriorating infrastructure that we started with." Asked if he was concerned about the performance of the new contractors, Mr. Ahmed said, with a note of fatalism that is typical of Iraq: "It's out of our control. What can we do? But they will learn."

      &nbsp; July 26, 2004 .By C. J. CHIVERS ZHEVSK, Russia, July 24 - The bazaar in this industrial city shows why Western companies regard Russia as a land of piracy. Bootlegged copies of new American movies - "King Arthur,'' "Troy'' and "Spider-Man 2'' - sell for $3. Photoshop CS, a $600 program in Western stores, fetches $2.75.  Markets like this, found throughout Russia, have been a longstanding subject of diplomatic complaint. Washington contends Russian intellectual-property pirates cost the United States more than $1 billion a year. Now Russia is striking back. A Russian industry and product designer are asserting that the United States has been abetting intellectual-property pirates to suit its own needs, by directing copies of Russian merchandise around the world.  The complaint is not about software or music. It makes no mention of movies or video games. It is about the Kalashnikov assault rifle, the most prolific firearm ever made.  "We see a great number of products which are named after Kalashnikov, my name,'' said Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, the weapon's original designer. "They are buying Kalashnikovs from other countries,'' he added.  Since the collapses of the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein's army in Iraq, the United States has been purchasing or arranging the transfer of thousands of knockoffs of Kalashnikovs commonly referred to as AK-47's, to outfit new military and security forces in Kabul and Baghdad.  These rifles have not been made in Russia, where the arms industry holds patents for the weapon in several nations. Instead they have originated in weapons plants controlled by Eastern European states, each of which was a partner of Moscow's in Soviet days.  So begins an argument at once curious, impassioned and bizarre, involving the legacy of cold war influence jockeying, secretive arms deals, recent efforts to defeat modern Islamic insurgencies, and international business and patent law. The automatic Kalashnikov, made in a factory here, is in many ways Moscow's Ford. It is a quintessential national product: extraordinarily successful, widespread, a name closely connected to the identity of a state.  It was designed by Mr. Kalashnikov, a former Russian tank sergeant, in classified Soviet weapons trials shortly after World War II, and was promptly embraced by Soviet soldiers for its simplicity and reliability under almost any condition. It is regarded as a weapon that rarely, if ever, fails. Russian arms officials say that no other nation has a valid license to make the AK-47 and its many derivatives and clones, and that to defeat insurgents and terrorists, Washington has been encouraging violations of intellectual property rights. Russia is suffering losses in income, jobs and damage to the Kalashnikov name, the officials say, and would like the United States to shop for the weapons directly from here.  "We would like to inform everybody in the world that many countries, including the United States, have unfortunately violated recognized norms," said Igor Sevastyanov, who leads a division of Rosoboronexport, Russia's state-controlled arms export company. American officials confirm that non-Russian Kalashnikov rifles have been provided with American assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq. Sometimes the weapons have been transferred via purchases on international arms markets, they say, other times via the solicitation of donations from friendly states as a gesture of cooperation with the Bush administration's war and reconstruction efforts. The officials also say that they are aware of the Russian complaints, which raise questions of provenance that remain unresolved.  "We have taken the position that there are important issues with respect to the production, intellectual property rights and conditions of export of these weapons, and it is important that we strengthen controls in all of these areas," a State Department official said. Officials from Rosoboronexport and Izhmash, the Russian company holding patents on the rifle, say American-coordinated transfers include Kalashnikov clones made in Romanian, Bulgarian and Hungarian plants that have continued to be sold despite Russian complaints.  Another transfer, arranged by the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq last year, involved the purchase of Kalashnikovs from Jordan. The weapons were believed to be excess stock from the Jordanian army, and to have been manufactured years ago by the former East Germany, another State Department official said. The transfers have been diplomatically delicate; the Jordanian deal drew complaints from across the political spectrum. American business representatives have said that American-made rifles should be bought to preserve American jobs. Others questioned the wisdom of shipping more automatic rifles to countries already awash in such guns.  Congressman have asked why American forces did not save money by reissuing to friendly forces the thousands of Kalashnikov rifles confiscated in both wars.  (Last spring, journalists from The New York Times watched United States marines collect tens of thousands of mint-condition Kalashnikovs in a cache in a hospital in Tikrit. The weapons were still in their original packing crates.) In spite of complaints, the transfers continued, American officials say, in part because the automatic Kalashnikov is inexpensive and requires less training to master than modern American rifles. Several officials noted that many young Iraqi and Afghan men already know how to use it. Izhmash and Rosoboronexport agree with this position; their officials are even proud that the Pentagon prefers the Kalashnikov for its new allies.  But they say Washington's deals have come at the expense of Izhmash and Izhevsk, where mass production of the rifles began in 1949, and where orders and the work force have shrunk since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. More than 12,000 people worked on the gun lines then; roughly 7,000 work there today, and at fewer shifts, said Andrei Vishnyakov, an Izhmash official. The officials noted that the low price of Kalashnikov knockoffs can make it impossible to sell the genuine item, a phenomenon resembling the underselling of software and DVD's, albeit on a different scale.  For example, the Jordanian rifles sold for about $60 each - less than one-fourth of the price of a new Kalashnikov from the Izhmash plant, according to Rosoboronexport data.  "They are selling these rifles at dump prices," said Alexander G. Likhachev, a former Izhmash director who is now an official with the state arms agency.  He added that Russia wants that business. "We are prepared to manufacture the genuine weapons, in big quantities, because we know there is a demand," he said. The legal standing of Rosoboronexport's complaint is uncertain. American officials, analysts and trade representatives said issues surrounding each transfer would require intensive legal research to resolve. The task would be daunting. In the 1950's, in a mix of collaborative revolutionary spirit and jockeying against the West, the Soviet Union began exporting the rifles and the technology to manufacture them to states in its sphere of influence. Ultimately, Moscow entered licensing agreements with 18 states, according to Rosoboronexport. "We transferred and gave them all the technical documentation, all the know-how about the design," Mr. Kalashnikov, now 84, said in an interview at his dacha in the Russian woods. "Representatives of these countries came here. They studied our production line." Moreover, once the rifle's utility became well known, another 11 countries began making derivatives and clones without Moscow's approval, the state agency said. Russia says that all former licenses have expired. But to make this case, the old licenses would have to be studied, as would Izhmash's more recently acquired patents as well as intellectual property laws in each Kalashnikov-manufacturing state.  A third American official said several former Soviet-bloc countries that formerly made Kalashnikovs with Moscow's approval contend they retain rights to the weapon today. "There is a dispute among all the parties involved," the official said. Still, whatever the legal merits, analysts agree: the complaint's symbolic power is great.  "I'm not a big fan of guns, but that said, if the creators of this intellectual property have rights to enforce, I really do hope they can get them enforced in every country," Eric Schwartz, a vice president of the International Intellectual Property Alliance, said in a telephone interview. "And I hope that the United States government would comply and set a good example." The alliance represents American companies with products protected by copyright laws. The complaint also faces the unrelenting realities of the market. After decades in production in plants in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe, the automatic Kalashnikov has spread far beyond Izhevsk's reach. Analysts estimate that 70 million to 105 million of the weapons have been made.  It has been used not only by more than 55 state armies, but also by the Viet Cong, militias in Beirut, Palestinian insurgents in Gaza City, guerrillas in Iraq and child soldiers in Asian and African states. A Kalashnikov is on the seal of Hezbollah and the flag of Mozambique. It features prominently in the symbolism of jihad.  Even the United States long ago entered in the Kalashnikov business, in the 1980's, when it surreptitiously bought Chinese and Egyptian Kalashnikovs for Islamic guerrillas battling the Red Army in Afghanistan. American purchases of Kalashnikovs have continued intermittently since then. A few years ago, according to officials at the State Department and the Pentagon, Washington purchased Kalashnikovs for a Nigerian peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone.  With so many of the weapons in circulation, one analyst said Russia's complaint could prove to be an almost impossible fight.  Rosoboronexport's position is like "the Chinese saying they have a royalty right on every firearm, because that's where it all started with the invention of gunpowder 700 years ago," said Dr. Aaron Karp, a professor at Old Dominion University in Virginia who specializes in weapon proliferation issues. Mr. Kalashnikov, who said the Russian versions of his rifle are superior, and who expressed deep fondness to Russian workers who have long made them, recognized the difficulties in the state agency's complaint.  He remembered that years ago President Boris N. Yeltsin vowed to defend the weapon from market infringement, to no avail. "President Yeltsin said he would do everything," Mr. Kalashnikov said. "But it's not so easy."

      Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing, Bin  Ladin’s 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and  private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack.  In August 1996, Bin Ladin had issued his own self-styled fatwa calling on  Muslims to drive American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia.The long, disjointed  document condemned the Saudi monarchy for allowing the presence of an  army of infidels in a land with the sites most sacred to Islam, and celebrated  recent suicide bombings of American military facilities in the Kingdom. It  praised the 1983 suicide bombing in Beirut that killed 241 U.S. Marines, the  1992 bombing in Aden,and especially the 1993 firefight in Somalia after which  the United States “left the area carrying disappointment, humiliation, defeat  and your dead with you.”3  Bin Ladin said in his ABC interview that he and his followers had been  preparing in Somalia for another long struggle, like that against the Soviets in  Afghanistan, but “the United States rushed out of Somalia in shame and disgrace.”  Citing the Soviet army’s withdrawal from Afghanistan as proof that a  ragged army of dedicated Muslims could overcome a superpower, he told the  interviewer:“We are certain that we shall—with the grace of Allah—prevail  over the Americans.”He went on to warn that “If the present injustice continues  . . . , it will inevitably move the battle to American soil.”4  Plans to attack the United States were developed with unwavering singlemindedness  throughout the 1990s. Bin Ladin saw himself as called “to follow  in the footsteps of the Messenger and to communicate his message to all  nations,”5 and to serve as the rallying point and organizer of a new kind of war  to destroy America and bring the world to Islam.

      Unemployment Figures Sometimes Hard To Figure Out05.03.2004 5:22 PM EDT On the face of it, measuring unemployment seems fairly simple. Count the number of people who are able to work, count how many of them don't have jobs, and divide that number by the first number. Done.  Wrong.  U.S. unemployment figures comes from a monthly survey conducted by the Labor Department. Every month 60,000 homes (that’s about 1 in every 2,000 households in America) are called and asked how many people in that household are looking for work and how many have jobs. Those numbers are extrapolated to give a picture of the nation as a whole. But a person without a job isn't automatically classified as unemployed. To be considered unemployed, someone has to be out of work and actively looking for a job at the time when the Labor Department calls. Folks who aren't looking at that particular time are dubbed "discouraged" but not unemployed. That's about 500,000 folks by the Labor Department's estimates.  Plus, there's no mechanism to account for the more than 4.5 million people who have taken part-time employment because they can't find full-time gigs. So if you’re a computer programmer who gets laid off and ends up flipping burgers part time, the government calls these you "underemployed," but employed nonetheless.  If you added the "discouraged" and "underemployed" Americans into the standard unemployment statistic, it would climb to 10 percent, nearly double the 5.6 percent unemployment reported by the latest survey. Those numbers may seem alarming, but it's really not too shabby."In this economy, the amazing thing is that more people aren't unemployed, because the amount of job creation and destruction that takes place in any given year is really quite incredible," says New York University economics professor John Leahy, pointing out the formidable self-corrective tendencies of the U.S. economy. "Over the last 30 years, for instance, every year about 10 percent of manufacturing jobs disappear, and 10 percent are created brand-new, so if you applied that to the whole economy, that's like 15 million people every year losing their jobs and getting new ones. Those are huge numbers."&nbsp;  So it turns out that employment figures are a lot trickier than you'd think. Just think, if only 60,000 households are called that means only about 1 in every 2,000. If you come from a town to 20,000 households, that means 10 households in your town represent the whole town. So, if that’s not the best way to think about it, maybe a little history lesson in the booms and busts is vital to a real understanding of what's going on.  Historically, unemployment in American hovers around 7 percent, well above the March number of 5.7 percent. Unemployment hit its lowest point in 1944, in the height of World War II productivity, when it was 1.2 percent. It was at its highest a mere 12 years before, during the Great Depression, with 23.6 percent unemployment in 1932. But most of the changes haven't been as drastic.  "There has also been very low-frequency movement, changes over decades, that are harder to explain and predict," says Leahy, citing such potential contributing factors as the proportion of young workers to old ones, the inflation rate and even the prison population.  And we appear to be in one of those hard-to-explain periods right now. Until March's job boom, the U.S. economy was said to be in a "jobless recovery," a stretch in which all the normal indicators — such as interest rates and consumer confidence — point up, but job creation is still down.  "It's a new phenomenon, and we don't really know why," Leahy said. "In some sense, the [Bush] administration isn't to be faulted for having predicted that job growth was just around the corner, because based on past models, it would've been. It's like predicting where a cliff is. You know there's one, but you're basically right until you're wrong. This is a good version of a cliff.  &nbsp; "But for those trying not to fall off the real employment cliff in the meantime, Leahy has a few words of wisdom — ones that may not offer immediate comfort, but likely paint a better long-term picture."It might not be that today is so bad," he said, "but just that yesterday was so amazingly good. Given the optimism of the 1990s, where the stock market was and all the hoopla over new technology, much of what's happening now could be a correction back to a more sensible, reasonable situation — normalcy."

       The Wrong War  Backdraft: How the war in Iraq has fueled Al Qaeda and ignited its dream of global jihad.    Peter Bergen  July/August 2004 Issue   President Bush's May 2003 announcement aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln that "major combat operations" had ended in Iraq has been replayed endlessly. What is less well remembered is just what the president claimed the United States had accomplished. "The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11th, 2001," he declared. The defeat of Saddam Hussein, he told the American people, was "a crucial advance in the campaign against terror." In fact, the consensus now emerging among a wide range of intelligence and counterterrorism professionals is that the opposite is true: The invasion of Iraq not only failed to help the war on terrorism, but it represented a substantial setback.   In more than a dozen interviews, experts both within and outside the U.S. government laid out a stark analysis of how the war has hampered the campaign against Al Qaeda. Not only, they point out, did the war divert resources and attention away from Afghanistan, seriously damaging the prospects of capturing Al Qaeda leaders, but it has also opened a new front for terrorists in Iraq and created a new justification for attacking Westerners around the world. Perhaps most important, it has dramatically speeded up the process by which Al Qaeda the organization has morphed into a broad-based ideological movement—a shift, in effect, from bin Laden to bin Ladenism. "If Osama believed in Christmas, this is what he'd want under his Christmas tree," one senior intelligence official told me. Another counterterrorism official suggests that Iraq might begin to resemble "Afghanistan 1996," a reference to the year that bin Laden seized on Afghanistan, a chaotic failed state, as his new base of operations.   Even Kenneth Pollack, one of the nation's leading experts on Iraq, whose book The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq made the most authoritative case for overthrowing Saddam Hussein, says, "My instinct tells me that the Iraq war has hindered the war on terrorism. You had to deal with Al Qaeda first, not Saddam. We had not crippled the Al Qaeda organization when we embarked on the Iraq war."   The damage to U.S. interests is hard to overestimate. Rohan Gunaratna, a Sri Lankan academic who is regarded as one of the world's leading authorities on Al Qaeda, points out that "sadness and anger about Iraq, even among moderate Muslims, is being harnessed and exploited by terrorist and extremist groups worldwide to grow in strength, size, and influence." Similarly, Vincent Cannistraro, a former chief of counterterrorism at the CIA under presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, says the Iraq war "accelerated terrorism" by "metastasizing" Al Qaeda. Today, Al Qaeda is more than the narrowly defined group that attacked the United States on September 11, 2001; it is a growing global movement that has been energized by the war in Iraq.   Peter Bergen is the author of the New York Times best-seller Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden. He is CNN's terrorism analyst and has written for such publications as the New York Times, Foreign Affairs, and The New Republic. A fellow at the New America Foundation, Bergen is also an adjunct professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

         These days, everyone seems to be puzzling over the same question: Why aren't people happy with President Bush's economic record? After all, judging from recent growth and unemployment numbers, the U.S. economy seems to be steaming along towards a full recovery. Yet in numerous polls, such as the most recent  urlLink CBS News /  New York Times   survey, Bush's approval ratings on economic matters hover in the low-40s. Is there a perception gap? Pundits have drawn parallels to former president George H.W. Bush, who presided over a healthy economic recovery in 1992, but still lost his re-election bid because voters never quite caught on.  Of course, it's easy to chalk up poll numbers to the supposed ignorance of the average voter. But in this case, the voters have it right: the recovery really hasn't been all that swell.    For starters, wages are not keeping pace with inflation, and as a result, real wages are going down, as a cursory look at  urlLink Bureau of Labor Statistics  numbers shows. Yet only a month ago, major papers like  The Washington Post  were trying to  urlLink argue  that wages have been rising. Recently, however, the major media woke up, and Eduardo Porter in Sunday's  New York Times   urlLink reported  that, in real terms, hourly pay has lately been  decreasing :    On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that hourly earnings of production workers - nonmanagement workers ranging from nurses and teachers to hamburger flippers and assembly-line workers - fell 1.1 percent in June, after accounting for inflation. The June drop, the steepest decline since the depths of recession in mid-1991, came after a 0.8 percent fall in real hourly earnings in May.     The article somewhat understates the case. As the Economic Policy Institute  urlLink pointed out  last week, real wages have declined in six of the last seven months. Porter goes on to suggest that the considerable supply of unemployed workers goes a long way toward explaining why paychecks aren't rising:    [Workers'] woes are a product of supply and demand for labor. From 1996 through 2000 when employers were hiring hand over fist, real hourly wages of ordinary workers rose by 7.5 percent. Those for leisure and hospitality workers rose 9.6 percent, and retail workers' climbed 8.9 percent. The raises continued even as the economy slipped into recession in 2001 and businesses began to shed workers.      From 2001 to 2003, 2.4 million jobs were eliminated, as businesses sharply reduced their work forces, refusing to hire back even as demand started picking up. Over a million of these jobs have been regained this year.      Yet with the lowest number of people employed as a share of the population since 1994, there is still a plentiful supply of unused laborers looking for jobs.     The key figure here is how many "unused laborers" there really are. John Kerry claims that the country has one million fewer jobs than when Bush took office. And the official unemployment rate counts 8.2 million people out of work. But as the  Times ' economic columnist Edmund Andrews  urlLink notes  there may be even more workers out of the labor force, if you include those workers not looking for jobs. Since 2000, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping this statistic, the number of such people has risen by 4.4 million. Although some of these workers have intentionally withdrawn from the labor force (to work, for example, as stay-at-home moms), many of these workers are simply discouraged. In that case, wages could continue to stagnate as millions of discouraged workers begin to look for work again.   Another debate surrounding the Bush recovery is over what  kind  of jobs are being created. In countless speeches, John Kerry has alleged that the bulk of new jobs have been created in low-wage sectors. Well, he would say that, wouldn't he? But it turns out that prominent Wall Street economists  urlLink share his view , including Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley, and David A. Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch:    "The vast majority of net new jobs created have been in the low-wage sectors of the economy, and income growth has been disappointing,'' David A. Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., wrote July 9. Lagging incomes may cause "consumer spending to slow in coming quarters."     Roach pointed out that "81 percent of the total job growth over the last year had been in lower-paying occupations like retail sales and transportation." Although economists have yet to reach a consensus on this point, the data certainly offers a reasonable explanation as to why workers have yet to embrace the Bush recovery.   As a general trend, the profits reaped by businesses during the recovery have not trickled down proportionally to workers, as  BusinessWeek   urlLink noted last month :    Up to now, profits going to big corporations along with earnings for smaller proprietorships and rents to landowners, all of which represent less than one-fourth of national income, have accounted for 46% of the increase since the recovery began. Pay and benefits to workers, about two-thirds of the total, have contributed a less-than-proportional 44% of the increase. By the end of 2003, the share of national income going to workers had slipped to the lowest level in nearly four decades.      BusinessWeek  expressed confidence that this trend would eventually correct itself. Others are not so sure. Thus Robert Reich in  The American Prospect :    But there's another, more disturbing possibility -- and it seems somewhat more likely. The wage slice will stay historically low, and the profit slice high, because employees have permanently lost bargaining power. Unions now represent fewer than 8 percent of private-sector workers, a figure that's been dropping steadily for many years.      Meanwhile, advances in telecommunications now enable many more companies to outsource to places like India and China, where wages are far lower. Or they can easily substitute computers and software for employees who might otherwise expect a raise. If these trends weren't enough to keep wages down, consider that big corporations are bigger and more powerful than ever. Think of Wal-Mart, now employing more Americans than the entire U.S. auto industry. Employers with this kind of clout can keep wages low just by refusing to raise them.     Much of Reich's analysis remains speculative -- at the moment, outsourcing does not  urlLink appear  to have had a tremendous impact on either employment or wages. But Reich may be right that the economy is suffering from structural problems that go beyond the usual cyclical ups and downs. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has also  urlLink expressed  similar concerns, noting that the country may be producing a shortage of high-skill workers and a surplus of low-skill ones. If this is the case, the country will need to see a drastic increase in worker training over the next few years.   But whatever the problems, it seems clear that the current administration is paying little attention. With voters restless over stagnant wages and poor job creation, it's no wonder they have little patience for Bush's willfully obtuse message: "We cut taxes! Everything will be fine!" Indeed, as Stan Collender noted in  National Journal , not even Bush's own economic team is willing to defend the administration's dismal policies anymore:    Has anyone seen or heard from the Bush administration’s economic and budget team?... National Economic Council Chairman Stephen Friedman has been practically invisible.... Greg Mankiw hasn’t been heard from since he made a politically incorrect statement back in February about... outsourcing.... Joshua Bolten... has been one of the least visible OMB directors.... John Snow... seems to be perceived more as a cheerleader than as a policymaker...     Indeed, when even the experts are fleeing the scene, it's hard to maintain the illusion that everything is fine. It looks like those skeptical voters aren't so ignorant after all.

      #1 The Neoconservative Plan for Global Dominance  Sources:The Sunday HeraldSeptember 15, 2002Title: "Bush Planned Iraq 'regime change' before becoming President"Author: Neil Mackay  Harper's MagazineOctober 2002Title: "Dick Cheney's Song of America"Author: David Armstrong  Mother JonesMarch 2003Title: "The 30 Year Itch"Author: Robert Dreyfuss  Pilger.comDecember 12, 2002Title: "Hidden Agendas"Author: John PilgerRandom Lengths NewsOctober 4, 2002 Title: "Iraq Attack-The Aims and Origins of Bush's Plans"Author: Paul Rosenberg  Project Censored wishes to acknowledge that Jim Lobe, the Washington, D.C. correspondent for Inter Press Service (IPS), has been covering the ways in which neo-conservatives, using the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) among other mechanisms, used the 9/11 attacks to pursue their own agenda of global dominance and reshaping the Middle East virtually from the outset of the Bush administration’s “war on terrorism.” For more information, please vist the following link:  urlLink http://www.ipsnews.net/focus/neo-cons/index.asp   Faculty Evaluators: Phil Beard Ph.D. and Tom Lough Ph.D.Student Researcher: Dylan Citrin Cummins  Corporate Media Partial Coverage: Atlantic Journal Constitution, 9/29/02, The President's Real goal in Iraq, By Jay Bookman  Over the last year corporate media have made much of Saddam Hussein and his stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Rarely did the press or, especially, television address the possibility that larger strategies might also have driven the decision to invade Iraq. Broad political strategies regarding foreign policy do indeed exist and are part of the public record. The following is a summary of the current strategies that have formed over the last 30 years; strategies that eclipse the pursuit of oil and that preceded Hussein's rise to power:In the 1970s, the United States and the Middle East were embroiled in a tug-of-war over oil. At the time, American military presence in the Gulf was fairly insignificant and the prospect of seizing control of Arab oil fields by force was pretty unattainable. Still, the idea of this level of dominance was very attractive to a group of hard-line, pro-military Washington insiders that included both Democrats and Republicans. Eventually labeled "neoconservatives," this circle of influential strategists played important roles in the Defense Departments of Ford, Reagan and Bush Sr., at conservative think tanks throughout the '80s and '90s, and today occupies several key posts in the White House, Pentagon, and State Department. Most principal among them are:·Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, our current Vice-President and Defense Secretary respectively, who have been closely aligned since they served with the Ford administration in the 1970s; ·Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, the key architect of the post-war reconstruction of Iraq; ·Richard Perle, past-chairman and still-member of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board that has great influence over foreign military policies; ·William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and founder of the powerful, neo-conservative think-tank, Project for a New American Century.In the 1970s, however, neither high-level politicos, nor the American people, shared the priorities of this small group of military strategists. In 1979 the Shah of Iran fell and U.S. political sway in the region was greatly jeopardized. In 1980, the Carter Doctrine declared the Gulf "a zone of U.S. influence." It warned (especially the Soviets) that any attempt to gain control of the Persian Gulf region would be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the U.S. and repelled by any means necessary, including military force. This was followed by the creation of the Rapid Deployment Force — a military program specifically designed to rush several thousand U.S. troops to the Gulf on short notice.Under President Reagan, the Rapid Deployment Force was transformed into the U.S. Central Command that oversaw the area from eastern Africa to Afghanistan. Bases and support facilities were established throughout the Gulf region, and alliances were expanded with countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. Since the first Gulf War, the U.S. has built a network of military bases that now almost completely encircle the oil fields of the Persian Gulf.In 1989, following the end of the Cold War and just prior to the Gulf War, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, and Paul Wolfowitz produced the 'Defense Planning Guidance' report advocating U.S. military dominance around the globe. The Plan called for the United States to maintain and grow in military superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge us on the world stage. Using words like 'preemptive' and military 'forward presence,’ the plan called for the U.S. to be dominant over friends and foes alike. It concluded with the assertion that the U.S. can best attain this position by making itself 'absolutely powerful.'The 1989 plan was spawned after the fall of the Soviet Union. Without the traditional threat to national security, Cheney, Powell and Wolfowitz knew that the military budget would dwindle without new enemies and threats. In an attempt to salvage defense funding, Cheney and company constructed a plan to fill the 'threat blank'. On August 2, 1990 President Bush called a press conference. He explained that the threat of global war had significantly receded, but in its wake a new danger arose. This unforeseen threat to national security could come from any angle and from any power. Iraq, by a remarkable coincidence, invaded Northern Kuwait later the same day.Cheney et al. were out of political power for the eight years of Clinton’s presidency. During this time the neo-conservatives founded the Project for the New American Century (PNAC). The most influential product of the PNAC was a report entitled "Rebuilding America's Defense," (www.newamericancentury.org) which called for U.S. military dominance and control of global economic markets.With the election of George W. Bush, the authors of the plan were returned to power: Cheney as vice president, Powell as Secretary of State, and Wolfowitz in the number two spot at the Pentagon. With the old Defense Planning Guidance as the skeleton, the three went back to the drawing board. When their new plan was complete, it included contributions from Wolfowitz's boss Donald Rumsfeld. The old 'preemptive' attacks have now become 'unwarned attacks.' The Powell-Cheney doctrine of military 'forward presence' has been replaced by 'forward deterrence.' The U.S. stands ready to invade any country deemed a possible threat to our economic interests.  Update by David Armstrong Just days after this story appeared, the Bush administration unveiled its “new” National Security Strategy, which effectively validated the article’s main thesis. The NSS makes clear that the administration will pursue a policy of pre-emption and overwhelming military superiority aimed at ensuring US dominance. Since that time, the major media have generally come around to the point of view presented in the article. The New York Times, which originally rejected the article’s premise, now makes a virtual mantra of the notion that the current security strategy is little more than a warmed-over version of the policy drafted during the first Bush administration of preventing new rivals from rising up to challenge the US in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse. The article circulated widely, particularly in the run up to the war in Iraq, and was entered into the Congressional Record. It also became a topic of discussion on such outlets as the BBC, NPR, MSNBC, various talk radio shows, and European newspapers. In the process, it has substantially helped shape the debate about the Bush administration’s foreign policy.  Update by Bob Dreyfuss For months leading up to the war against Iraq, it was widely assumed among critics of the war that a hidden motive for military action was Iraq's oil, not terrorism or weapons of mass destruction. In fact, "No Blood for Oil" became perhaps the leading slogan and bumper sticker of the peace movement. Yet, there was very little examination in the media of the role of oil in American policy toward Iraq and the Persian Gulf, and what coverage did exist tended to pooh-pooh or debunk the idea that the war had anything to do with oil. So, I set out to place the war with Iraq in the context of a decades-long U.S. strategy of building up a military presence in the region, arguing that even before the war, the U.S. had turned the Gulf into a U.S. protectorate. Perhaps most importantly, I showed that a motive behind the war was oil as a national security issue, as a strategic commodity, not as a commercial one — and that, in fact, most of the oil industry itself was either opposed to or ambivalent about the idea of war against Saddam Hussein. Yet the neoconservatives in the Bush administration, whose forebears had proposed occupying the oil fields of the Gulf in the mid-1970s, sought control of the oil in the region as the cornerstone of American empire.Since the end of this war, it has become clear that the United States (and the U.K.) have aggressively sought to maintain direct control over Iraq's oil industry. When looters devastated Baghdad, only the Ministry of Oil was unscathed, since U.S. marines protected it. Since then, handpicked Iraqi officials have been installed in the ministry, under the supervision of U.S. military and civilian officials, and there is movement toward privatization of Iraq's oil industry, a point that I emphasized in my writing on the topic before the war. Not only that, but it is increasingly clear that France, Russia, and China are likely to be excluded from either rebuilding the industry and securing contracts for future Iraqi oil delivery.I can't say that the media followed up on my exposure of this issue, except that I appeared on a number of radio and television talk show programs as a result of my writing on Iraq, in both Mother Jones and The American Prospect, as well as C-Span, CNBC, and CBC-TV in Canada. I was also invited to make a presentation on "The Thirty-Year Itch" at the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam. According to Mother Jones, the article drew more traffic to its web site than any other article.

      Two years ago a project set up by the men who now surround George W Bush said what America needed was "a new Pearl Harbor". Its published aims have, alarmingly, come true. : John Pilger :12 Dec 2002   The threat posed by US terrorism to the security of nations and individuals was outlined in prophetic detail in a document written more than two years ago and disclosed only recently. What was needed for America to dominate much of humanity and the world's resources, it said, was "some catastrophic and catalysing event - like a new Pearl Harbor". The attacks of 11 September 2001 provided the "new Pearl Harbor", described as "the opportunity of ages". The extremists who have since exploited 11 September come from the era of Ronald Reagan, when far-right groups and "think-tanks" were established to avenge the American "defeat" in Vietnam. In the 1990s, there was an added agenda: to justify the denial of a "peace dividend" following the cold war. The Project for the New American Century was formed, along with the American Enterprise Institute, the Hudson Institute and others that have since merged the ambitions of the Reagan administration with those of the current Bush regime.  One of George W Bush's "thinkers" is Richard Perle. I interviewed Perle when he was advising Reagan; and when he spoke about "total war", I mistakenly dismissed him as mad. He recently used the term again in describing America's "war on terror". "No stages," he said. "This is total war. We are fighting a variety of enemies. There are lots of them out there. All this talk about first we are going to do Afghanistan, then we will do Iraq... this is entirely the wrong way to go about it. If we just let our vision of the world go forth, and we embrace it entirely and we don't try to piece together clever diplomacy, but just wage a total war... our children will sing great songs about us years from now."  Perle is one of the founders of the Project for the New American Century, the PNAC. Other founders include Dick Cheney, now vice-president, Donald Rumsfeld, defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defence secretary, I Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff, William J Bennett, Reagan's education secretary, and Zalmay Khalilzad, Bush's ambassador to Afghanistan. These are the modern chartists of American terrorism. The PNAC's seminal report, Rebuilding America's Defences: strategy, forces and resources for a new century, was a blueprint of American aims in all but name. Two years ago it recommended an increase in arms-spending by $48bn so that Washington could "fight and win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars". This has happened. It said the United States should develop "bunker-buster" nuclear weapons and make "star wars" a national priority. This is happening. It said that, in the event of Bush taking power, Iraq should be a target. And so it is.  As for Iraq's alleged "weapons of mass destruction", these were dismissed, in so many words, as a convenient excuse, which it is. "While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification," it says, "the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein." How has this grand strategy been implemented? A series of articles in the Washington Post, co-authored by Bob Woodward of Watergate fame and based on long interviews with senior members of the Bush administration, reveals how 11 September was manipulated.   On the morning of 12 September 2001, without any evidence of who the hijackers were, Rumsfeld demanded that the US attack Iraq.  According to Woodward, Rumsfeld told a cabinet meeting that Iraq should be "a principal target of the first round in the war against terrorism". Iraq was temporarily spared only because Colin Powell, the secretary of state, persuaded Bush that "public opinion has to be prepared before a move against Iraq is possible". Afghanistan was chosen as the softer option. If Jonathan Steele's estimate in the Guardian is correct, some 20,000 people in Afghanistan paid the price of this debate with their lives.  Time and again, 11 September is described as an "opportunity". In last April's New Yorker, the investigative reporter Nicholas Lemann wrote that Bush's most senior adviser, Condoleezza Rice, told him she had called together senior members of the National Security Council and asked them "to think about 'how do you capitalise on these opportunities'", which she compared with those of "1945 to 1947": the start of the cold war. Since 11 September, America has established bases at the gateways to all the major sources of fossil fuels, especially central Asia. The Unocal oil company is to build a pipeline across Afghanistan. Bush has scrapped the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions, the war crimes provisions of the International Criminal Court and the anti-ballistic missile treaty. He has said he will use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states "if necessary". Under cover of propaganda about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction, the Bush regime is developing new weapons of mass destruction that undermine international treaties on biological and chemical warfare.  In the Los Angeles Times, the military analyst William Arkin describes a secret army set up by Donald Rumsfeld, similar to those run by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and which Congress outlawed. This "super-intelligence support activity" will bring together the "CIA and military covert action, information warfare, and deception". According to a classified document prepared for Rumsfeld, the new organisation, known by its Orwellian moniker as the Proactive Pre-emptive Operations Group, or P2OG, will provoke terrorist attacks which would then require "counter-attack" by the United States on countries "harbouring the terrorists".  In other words, innocent people will be killed by the United States. This is reminiscent of Operation Northwoods, the plan put to President Kennedy by his military chiefs for a phoney terrorist campaign - complete with bombings, hijackings, plane crashes and dead Americans - as justification for an invasion of Cuba. Kennedy rejected it. He was assassinated a few months later. Now Rumsfeld has resurrected Northwoods, but with resources undreamt of in 1963 and with no global rival to invite caution. You have to keep reminding yourself this is not fantasy: that truly dangerous men, such as Perle and Rumsfeld and Cheney, have power. The thread running through their ruminations is the importance of the media: "the prioritised task of bringing on board journalists of repute to accept our position".  "Our position" is code for lying. Certainly, as a journalist, I have never known official lying to be more pervasive than today. We may laugh at the vacuities in Tony Blair's "Iraq dossier" and Jack Straw's inept lie that Iraq has developed a nuclear bomb (which his minions rushed to "explain"). But the more insidious lies, justifying an unprovoked attack on Iraq and linking it to would-be terrorists who are said to lurk in every Tube station, are routinely channelled as news. They are not news; they are black propaganda.  This corruption makes journalists and broadcasters mere ventriloquists' dummies. An attack on a nation of 22 million suffering people is discussed by liberal commentators as if it were a subject at an academic seminar, at which pieces can be pushed around a map, as the old imperialists used to do.  The issue for these humanitarians is not primarily the brutality of modern imperial domination, but how "bad" Saddam Hussein is. There is no admission that their decision to join the war party further seals the fate of perhaps thousands of innocent Iraqis condemned to wait on America's international death row. Their doublethink will not work. You cannot support murderous piracy in the name of humanitarianism. Moreover, the extremes of American fundamentalism that we now face have been staring at us for too long for those of good heart and sense not to recognise them.

      CounterPunch  October 11, 2002 Addiction, Brain Damage and the President "Dry Drunk" Syndrome and George W. Bush  by KATHERINE van WORMER  Ordinarily I would not use this term. But when I came across the article "Dry Drunk" - - Is Bush Making a Cry for Help? in American Politics Journal by Alan Bisbort, I was ready to concede, in the case of George W. Bush, the phrase may be quite apt.  Dry drunk is a slang term used by members and supporters of Alcoholics Anonymous and substance abuse counselors to describe the recovering alcoholic who is no longer drinking, one who is dry, but whose thinking is clouded. Such an individual is said to be dry but not truly sober. Such an individual tends to go to extremes.  It was when I started noticing the extreme language that colored President Bush's speeches that I began to wonder. First there were the terms-- "crusade" and "infinite justice" that were later withdrawn. Next came "evil doers," "axis of evil," and "regime change", terms that have almost become clichés in the mass media. Something about the polarized thinking and the obsessive repetition reminded me of many of the recovering alcoholics/addicts I had treated. (A point worth noting is that because of the connection between addiction and "stinking thinking," relapse prevention usually consists of work in the cognitive area). Having worked with recovering alcoholics for years, I flinched at the single-mindedness and ego- and ethnocentricity in the President's speeches. (My husband likened his phraseology to the gardener character played by Peter Sellers in the movie, Being There). Since words are the tools, the representations, of thought, I wondered what Bush's choice of words said about where he was coming from. Or where we would be going.  First, in this essay, we will look at the characteristics of the so-called "dry drunk;" then we will see if they apply to this individual, our president; and then we will review his drinking history for the record. What is the dry drunk syndrome? "Dry drunk" traits consist of:          * Exaggerated self-importance and pomposity         * Grandiose behavior         * A rigid, judgmental outlook         * Impatience         * Childish behavior         * Irresponsible behavior         * Irrational rationalization         * Projection         * Overreaction   Clearly, George W. Bush has all these traits except exaggerated self importance. He may be pompous, especially with regard to international dealings, but his actual importance hardly can be exaggerated. His power, in fact, is such that if he collapses into paranoia, a large part of the world will collapse with him. Unfortunately, there are some indications of paranoia in statements such as the following: "We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends." The trait of projection is evidenced here as well, projection of the fact that we are ready to attack onto another nation which may not be so inclined.  Bush's rigid, judgmental outlook comes across in virtually all his speeches. To fight evil, Bush is ready to take on the world, in almost a Biblical sense. Consider his statement with reference to Israel: "Look my job isn't to try to nuance. I think moral clarity is important... this is evil versus good."  Bush's tendency to dichotomize reality is not on the Internet list above, but it should be, as this tendency to polarize is symptomatic of the classic addictive thinking pattern. I describe this thinking distortion in Addiction Treatment: A Strengths Perspective as either/or reasoning-- "either you are with us or against us." Oddly, Bush used those very words in his dealings with other nations. All-or-nothing thinking is a related mode of thinking commonly found in newly recovering alcoholics/addicts. Such a worldview traps people in a pattern of destructive behavior.  Obsessive thought patterns are also pronounced in persons prone to addiction. There are organic reasons for this due to brain chemistry irregularities; messages in one part of the brain become stuck there. This leads to maddening repetition of thoughts. President Bush seems unduly focused on getting revenge on Saddam Hussein ("he tried to kill my Dad") leading the country and the world into war, accordingly.  Grandiosity enters the picture as well. What Bush is proposing to Congress is not the right to attack on one country but a total shift in military policy: America would now have the right to take military action before the adversary even has the capacity to attack. This is in violation, of course, of international law as well as national precedent. How to explain this grandiose request? Jane Bryant Quinn provides the most commonly offered explanation in a recent Newsweek editorial, "Iraq: It's the Oil, Stupid." Many other opponents of the Bush doctrine similarly seek a rational motive behind the obsession over first, the war on terror and now, Iraq. I believe the explanation goes deeper than oil, that Bush's logic is being given too much credit; I believe his obsession is far more visceral.  On this very day, a peace protestor in Portland held up the sign, "Drunk on Power." This, I believe, is closer to the truth. The drive for power can be an unquenchable thirst, addictive in itself. Senator William Fulbright, in his popular bestseller of the 1960s, The Arrogance of Power, masterfully described the essence of power-hungry politics as the pursuit of power; this he conceived as an end in itself. "The causes and consequences of war may have more to do with pathology than with politics," he wrote, "more to do with irrational pressures of pride and pain than with rational calculation of advantage and profit."  Another "dry drunk" trait is impatience. Bush is far from a patient man: "If we wait for threats to fully materialize," he said in a speech he gave at West Point, "we will have waited too long." Significantly, Bush only waited for the United Nations and for Congress to take up the matter of Iraq's disarmament with extreme reluctance.  Alan Bisbort argues that Bush possesses the characteristics of the "dry drunk" in terms of: his incoherence while speaking away from the script; his irritability with anyone (for example, Germany's Schröder) who dares disagree with him; and his dangerous obsessing about only one thing (Iraq) to the exclusion of all other things.  In short, George W. Bush seems to possess the traits characteristic of addictive persons who still have the thought patterns that accompany substance abuse. If we consult the latest scientific findings, we will discover that scientists can now observe changes that occur in the brain as a result of heavy alcohol and other drug abuse. Some of these changes may be permanent. Except in extreme cases, however, these cognitive impairments would not be obvious to most observers.  To reach any conclusions we need of course to know Bush's personal history relevant to drinking/drug use. To this end I consulted several biographies. Yes, there was much drunkenness, years of binge drinking starting in college, at least one conviction for DUI in 1976 in Maine, and one arrest before that for a drunken episode involving theft of a Christmas wreath. According to J.D. Hatfield's book, Fortunate Son, Bush later explained:      "[A]lcohol began to compete with my energies....I'd lose focus." Although he once said he couldn't remember a day he hadn't had a drink, he added that he didn't believe he was "clinically alcoholic." Even his father, who had known for years that his son had a serious drinking problem, publicly proclaimed: "He was never an alcoholic. It's just he knows he can't hold his liquor."  Bush drank heavily for over 20 years until he made the decision to abstain at age 40. About this time he became a "born again Christian," going as usual from one extreme to the other. During an Oprah interview, Bush acknowledged that his wife had told him he needed to think about what he was doing. When asked in another interview about his reported drug use, he answered honestly, "I'm not going to talk about what I did 20 to 30 years ago."  That there might be a tendency toward addiction in Bush's family is indicated in the recent arrests or criticism of his daughters for underage drinking and his niece for cocaine possession. Bush, of course, deserves credit for his realization that he can't drink moderately, and his decision today to abstain. The fact that he doesn't drink moderately, may be suggestive of an inability to handle alcohol. In any case, Bush has clearly gotten his life in order and is in good physical condition, careful to exercise and rest when he needs to do so. The fact that some residual effects from his earlier substance abuse, however slight, might cloud the U.S. President's thinking and judgment is frightening, however, in the context of the current global crisis.  One final consideration that might come into play in the foreign policy realm relates to Bush's history relevant to his father. The Bush biography reveals the story of a boy named for his father, sent to the exclusive private school in the East where his father's reputation as star athlete and later war hero were still remembered. The younger George's achievements were dwarfed in the school's memory of his father. Athletically he could not achieve his father's laurels, being smaller and perhaps less strong. His drinking bouts and lack of intellectual gifts held him back as well. He was popular and well liked, however. His military record was mediocre as compared to his father's as well. Bush entered the Texas National Guard. What he did there remains largely a mystery. There are reports of a lot of barhopping during this period. It would be only natural that Bush would want to prove himself today, that he would feel somewhat uncomfortable following, as before, in his father's footsteps. I mention these things because when you follow his speeches, Bush seems bent on a personal crusade. One motive is to avenge his father. Another seems to be to prove himself to his father. In fact, Bush seems to be trying somehow to achieve what his father failed to do - - to finish the job of the Gulf War, to get the "evildoer" Saddam.  To summarize, George W. Bush manifests all the classic patterns of what alcoholics in recovery call "the dry drunk." His behavior is consistent with barely noticeable but meaningful brain damage brought on by years of heavy drinking and possible cocaine use. All the classic patterns of addictive thinking that are spelled out in my book are here:  the tendency to go to extremes (leading America into a massive 100 billion dollar strike-first war);      * a "kill or be killed mentality;" the tunnel vision;     * "I" as opposed to "we" thinking;     * the black and white polarized thought processes (good versus evil, all or nothing thinking).     * His drive to finish his father's battles is of no small significance, psychologically.   If the public (and politicians) could only see what Fulbright noted as the pathology in the politics. One day, sadly, they will.

        From  http://money.cnn.com/2004/07/14/news/economy/overtime/index.htm	      6 million may still lose OT pay: study Labor-backed group says new revisions to work rules will still mean lost overtime for millions. July 14, 2004: 4:22 PM EDT By Andrew Stein, CNN/Money staff writer  NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Revised changes to overtime rules proposed by the Bush administration will still fail to protect overtime pay for 6 million workers, according to a new study.  The Labor Department, however, dismissed the study as a "rehash of misinformation."  The Bush administration issued proposed changes to overtime rules last year, but then revised them in March after criticism from some labor groups.  The original proposal would have stripped overtime protection for 8 million workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), which studies issues affecting middle- and lower-income workers and receives funding from some labor groups.  But the revisions would still strip OT pay for about 6 million workers, EPI said in a study released Tuesday.  "The 6 million number may be a little high, but I think the [EPI] analysis is the most complete," said Thomas Kochan, a management professor at MIT's Sloan School of Business.  "Some changes to the overtime rules are needed, but the ones proposed don't reflect the nature of work today."  In its report, the EPI said that its numbers are an estimate and "we have been unable to determine the impact of many of the changes with any precision."  Under current rules, a worker would have to meet three tests to become ineligible for overtime pay: a minimum pay test, an hourly-pay or salary test and a duties test.  The EPI said the revised rules announced in March would affect the duties test the most and "dramatically increase the number of workers who would be classified as 'professional,' 'administrative,' or 'executive' and thus remove millions of additional workers from overtime coverage," the EPI said.  For instance, the group contends that employees who merely recommend, but not carry out, the changes for two employees they supervise will be classified as executives and become exempt from overtime pay.  The Labor Department and supporters of the changes contend the revised regulations will update old rules, cover more workers and reduce the amount of class-action lawsuits.  "These latest 'studies' are a rehash of misinformation the AFL-CIO and its allies put out about the department's final Overtime Security Rule in April -- assertions that were completely discredited in congressional hearings," Labor Department spokesman Ed Frank said in a statement.  "This is a last-ditch effort to restart the misinformation campaign that has failed to cover up the fact that millions of workers will benefit from the Department's strong new overtime guarantees."  The conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation agreed.  The foundation said it estimated that nearly 1.3 million workers earning $155 to $455 a week would become eligible for overtime under the changes.  It said that the only workers who may lose overtime under the new rules are some individuals who earn more than $100,000 a year.  The EPI did say that another 400,000 employees who work overtime will now be paid for it, but added that pay for these workers would not be indexed for inflation, so that it will protect fewer workers over time.  The OT rule revisions are set to go into effect in August, but some members of Congress have vowed to stop them.  Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, has introduced an amendment that is attached to a corporate tax bill that will stop any worker from losing overtime rights.  "If the amendment is dropped and the rules go into effect in August, (Harkin) has vowed to find another way to block it in September," a staff member from Harkin's office said Wednesday.  The amendment is largely seen as a stop-gap measure, MIT's Kochan said, "until we have a revision that reflects the way work is done today."

      If they ever come up with a swashbuckling School, I think one of the courses should be Laughing, Then Jumping Off Something.   When you're riding in a time machine way far into the future, don't stick your elbow out the window, or it'll turn into a fossil.   It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man.   At first I thought, if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be "Clark Kent, Dentist," because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, "How's my back tooth?" and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and said, "Oh it's okay," then the patient would probably say, "Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?" and you'd say, "Aw [!@#%^&^] you, get outta here," and then he probably wouldn't even pay his bill.   One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said. "Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.   A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite. Then you call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone. "Hear that?" you say. "That's dynamite, baby."   Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better treatment"? I'd ask for a pinball machine, because with all that rocking back and forth you'd probably be able to get a lot of free games.   I'd like to be buried Indian-style, where they put you up on a high rack, above the ground. That way, you could get hit by meteorites and not even feel it.   If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look. He's carrying a soldering iron!" and started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, "That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free drink.   I bet when the neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, "Don't forget the thick, heavy brows." Then they would all get embarrassed because they remembered they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad and eat the snowman.   Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, "Think again, bat man."   Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the earth spin real fast and freak everybody out.   The people in the village were real poor, so none of the children had any toys. But this one little boy had gotten an old enema bag and filled it with rocks, and he would go around and whap the other children across the face with it. Man, I think my heart almost broke. Later the boy came up and offered to give me the toy. This was too much! I reached out my hand, but then he ran away. I chased him down and took the enema bag. He cried a little, but that's the way of these people.   I wish I had a Kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both Dracula AND Superman away.   I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to see more and more planets fall under the ruthless domination of our solar system.   Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis.   Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.   I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king, they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with some good ideas.   I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that said, "I helped skin Bob."   I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just woke up and go, "What was THAT?!"   The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face.   Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition.   I'd rather be rich than stupid.   If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So sue me."   If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave man, I guess I'm a coward.   I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every culture, is the story of Popeye.   When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask is if they ever press charges.   To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.   What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river to save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know.   We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me.   Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.   I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand, pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call hospitality.   To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.   As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp juiciness about it that was very pleasurable - until I realized it wasn't a nectarine at all, but A HUMAN HEAD!!   Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer.   If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.   Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up.   You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown who make people happy, but inside he's real sad. Also, he has severe diarrhea.   Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm myself down. I'll go over to the persons house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in the side of it's head with a note that says "You." After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done.   If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away.   If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that.   If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.   I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals.   Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someones neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing.   He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."   The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind it was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called "Dad." We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you.   If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is "Probably because of something you did."   Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything they see.   As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks." Marta said it should read "Watch for Pretty Rocks." I told her she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she started saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a simple letter! And I thought I was lazy!   One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late.   If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone.   Laurie got offended that I used the word "puke." But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like.   We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing. But we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with some whore he picked up in town.   I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.   As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint.   If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.   Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what is I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.   If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming.   When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.   Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky feeling.   The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw.   When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but if it's not, mmmmmmm, boy.   Whether they find a life there or not, I think Jupiter should be called an enemy planet.   Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of destruction, we should be thinking about getting more use out of the ones we already have.   I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. and since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick and give it to him.   Just because swans mate for life, I don't think its that big a deal. First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going to find a swan that looks much better than the one you've got, so why not mate for life?   If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because, come on, life is funny.   If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror, because I bet that will really throw you into a panic.   Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No, wait, not me, you.   I can't stand cheap people. It makes me real mad when someone says something like, "Hey, when are you going to pay me that $100 you owe me?" or "Do you have that $50 you borrowed?" Man, quit being so cheap!   I think the mistake a lot of us make is thinking the state-appointed shrink is our friend.   I think one way the cops could make money would be to hold a murder weapons sale. Many people could really use used ice picks.   If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet you could shoot beer out of you nose.   I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex.   Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a bit of freedom. I could walk freely, make my own meals, and even hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I discovered that they were not Indians at all but only dirty-clothes hampers.   I wish outer space guys would conquer the Earth and make people their pets, because I'd like to have one of those little beds with my name on it.   It's true that every time you hear a bell, an angel gets its wings. But what they don't tell you is that every time you hear a mouse trap snap, and Angel gets set on fire.   If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking, you can throw a real grenade at them.   I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it.   The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn't get more meat, I'll just say, "Oh, you mean this?" and pull out a big piece of meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've hidden it. Good magic trick, huh?   Life, to me, is like a quiet forest pool, one that needs a direct hit from a big rock half-buried in the ground. You pull and you pull, but you can't get the rock out of the ground. So you give it a good kick, but you lose your balance and go skidding down the hill toward the pool. Then out comes a big Hawaiian man who was screwing his wife beside the pool because they thought it was real pretty. He tells you to get out of there, but you start faking it, like you're talking Hawaiian, and then he gets mad and chases you...   Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the night, with no other cars around, I start imagining: What if there were no civilization out there? No cities, no factories, no people? And then I think: No people or factories? Then who made this car? And this highway? And I get so confused I have to stick my head out the window into the driving rain---unless there's lightning, because I could get struck on the head by a bolt.   The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he worked hard and saved his money. True, working at the hardware store didn't pay much, but he felt it was better than what everybody else did, which was go up to the volcano and collect the gold nuggets it shot out every day. It turned out he was right. After forty years, the volcano petered out. Everybody left town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then. Plus, he broke his leg and the doctor's bills were real high.   Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that everybody called the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to stand up in class and tell everybody, "You can make fun of the Cricket Boy if you want to, but to me he's just like everybody else." Then everybody would leave the Cricket Boy alone, and I'd invite him over to spend the night at my house, but after about five minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him out. Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family run out of town. Bye, Cricket Boy.   I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then, all of a sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks really take off! Also, Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.   I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my money for about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick. Then I'd go out West and start digging for gold. When someone came up and asked what I was doing, I'd say, "Looking for gold, ya durn fool." He'd say, "Your pick is gold," and I'd say, "Well, that was easy." Good joke, huh.   A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a snake. Then start an argument with him about who's going to go get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke.   I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't. Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as when you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he paid for his stupid puppet.   Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it "dull" that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bite got worse and worse, so he went to a doctor in town, and the secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see the doctor, and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that dull?   I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting. "That was fun," I said. "You bet it was," said Nick. "Let's climb higher." "No," I said. "I think we should be heading back now." "We have time," Nick insisted. I said we didn't, and Nick said we did. We argued back and forth like that for about 20 minutes, then finally decided to head back. I didn't say it was an interesting story.   If you're a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the ground. Then say, "Boy, these are good cigars!"   I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on.   If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps, which is not the inpression we are trying to convey with our store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control.   I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to the old board of his. Then he'd spin it round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and no matter where it stopped he'd yell out, "Tadpoles! Tadpoles is a winner!" We all thought he was crazy. But then we had some growing up to do.   Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you know." He stared telling hes story, about the treasure and his life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long." But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story is getting long." But then the story was over, and I said to myself: "You know, that story wasn't too long after all." I forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on the plane. It was a little long, though.   I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.   I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy---something like that.   -------------------- He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."  - Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey

      Things you have to believe to be a Republican today:  Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.  The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.  Government should relax regulation of Big Business and Big Money but crack down on individuals who use marijuana to relieve the pain of illness.  "Standing Tall for America'" means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India.  A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but, multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.  Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.  The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.  Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run for governor of California as a Republican.  If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.  A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.  HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart.  Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.  Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.  Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.  A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense.  A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.  Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.  The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.  You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have a right to adopt.  What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.  Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.

      COMMENTARY  Remember the moral of the story Jimmy Breslin  	  August 5, 2004  This is the fable that George Bush had to read to his children a long time ago.  It is one of the two fables that Bush has recited. We print the first immediately below and thus prominently, and then the second immediately after it.   The Boy Who Cried Wolf  There once was a shepherd boy who sat on the hillside watching the village sheep. He took a great breath and sang out: "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is threatening the sheep!"  The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the wolf away. But when they arrived at the top of the hill they found no wolf. The boy laughed to himself at the sight.  "Don't cry 'wolf,'" said the villagers, "when there's no wolf." They went down the hill.  Later, the boy sang out again, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is threatening the sheep!" He watched the villagers run up the hill to help him drive the wolf away.  When the villagers saw no wolf, they sternly said, "Save your frightened song for when there is really something wrong! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is NO wolf."  The boy just watched them go down the hill again.  Later, he saw a REAL wolf prowling about his flock. Alarmed, the boy leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could, "Wolf! Wolf!"  But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again, and so they didn't come.  The wolf, having no cause to fear, lacerated the sheep and caused the survivors to scatter. At sunset, everybody wondered why the shepherd hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy. They found him weeping.  "There really was a wolf here! The flock has scattered! I cried out, 'Wolf!' Why didn't you come?"  And a wise old man of the village said:  "A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth."    "The Boy That Cried Wolf" was so long ago that George Bush forgets it.  For here on Monday he was reading a second fable.  "Osama is coming!" he announced. Suddenly, the word "terror" ran the great city. Terrorism, terrorists, terrorist task force, anti-terrorist task force. Thomas Ridge, Bush's Homeland Security fake, said that for sure he was afraid they were coming. He had new intelligence that was horrifying:  Kerry could have been been doing the least bit better in polls.  Every time something like that happens, Bush stumbles or a 9/11 report comes out to make him look bad, he cries "terrorist." He has done this for over two years now.  This time, a great bin Laden target in New York was the Citigroup Center on Lexington Avenue. You could be incinerated if Osama gets at this building!  Right away in the morning, George Bush's wife and daughters rushed up from Washington to stand bravely in the front of all those cameras. It was not for the election. They truly wanted to stand with New Yorkers and be incinerated, the same as anybody else.  It probably was the one most fraudulent act we have had since the World Trade Center bombing, and at that time, Bush himself got up on a destroyed fire engine and pretended to be tough. While not saying that he froze during the attack.  Here is Bush's latest intelligence from his intelligence agents: George Bush tells us that once upon a time bin Laden measured our inclines in parking garages. Oh, Lord, call out the troops!  The terrorists had records of the inclines of underground garages in big New York buildings. The TV announcers read this with wide, fearful eyes.  And in 1993, one of the cab drivers from Jersey City, Salameh, had just put a light to a 15-foot rope that was going to sizzle into a truck full of fertilizer and blow up the Trade Center. Salameh was getting out of there in a car when in the exit incline was a truck that was stuck in the low ceiling. Salameh is terrorized. Finally, the truck gets moved and up the incline rush Salameh and crew. He is in prison forever. His incline story was told 1,500 times to American agents.  Bush also released the truly disturbing news that the terrorists are watching the uniforms worn by building security people. How chilling! How terrorizing!  Atta and the others wore polo shirts when they flew the planes into the World Trade Center buildings.  Nothing new was in the list of greatest danger that Bush released to the city in attempting to frighten everybody into believing that he should be re-elected. Here. Look at my soldiers in your streets.  And as you listen to George Bush telling his fable, if you listen carefully, you can hear in the background the faint but unmistakable cry of a wolf.

      WHAT IS WRONG WIT' THAT DEMOCRATIC PARTY? IT'S GOT A GOOD NAME DOESN'T IT?   urlLink    OPINION Okay, this has nothing to Do with comics or Neal's Project and it's just Neal's opinion but you don't have to read it.  Democrats, on balance, are the good guys. They are kinda goofy, rarely very rich, guilt ridden, smart, self-sacrificing, hard working, liberal, compassionate, sincere and truly democratic as a party.  The Republicans are, on balance, the good guys. They are rich, sorta corrupt, lazy, self indulgent, self important and proud of it, well educated but in a very class-conscious system, insensitive to lower classes concerns, unconscious of their own sins, they're like a rich gang who admits nothing; they depend on the concept that the poor don't vote (and they're probably right.) They also depend on a middle class who is used to listening to authority figures who constantly keep telling them that everything is okay. Authority figures who represent their own aspirations and desires of how much power and money they'd like to have and be.  Trouble is both these groups have their fatal flaws.  Republicans don't want to take care of the poor or the middle class or the dwindling workers They rrrreally don't give a rat's ass (except to get votes) about a dependent elderly. (Don't they disappear in a puff of smoke when they reach 65, or become night watchmen or doormen or something? They keep living? Have aspirations? Ideas? And want to be fed, housed and medicated? How inconvenient.) They hide their sins so so so so much better than the democrats. Only a guilt ridden liberal like Clinton would be caught in a lie like Clinton did. That scandal is a joke to a Republican behind closed doors.  Real Republicans who are generally moneyed, don't get that costs go up, rents go up, life's costs go up as wages stay still or, as in the case, of the recently fired (or laid-off) the new job pays less than the old job.   You won't believe this one. Real republicans don't understand that when you "lay off" a quarter of your work force those people aren't in a position to buy the products the rich man makes. They blame everyone else while they take worker's salaries as multimillion dollar bonuses for themselves. They're eating the good end of the ear of corn while the opposite end rots. And still the middle class believes the rich will take care of them.  The Democrats are the conscience of America. "Bleeding Hearts" is a good name for them. They are the caring party. People who are afraid of their extreme end because they fear that they'll lose money cause the democrats will have their hands in their pockets.  Fact is, of course democrats take their money to help the poor and lower middle classes and social services and the republicans take the same money to line their own pockets, make war, travel and entertain their friends and families. This is a simplification of course but it's generally true.  To score points, the republicans say the democrats will raise taxes. And incredible as it might seem, the democrats agree and to solve problems they think they must indeed increase taxes.  This is their fatal flaw. Americans don't want to pay more taxes. Americans are bleeding money already. Democrats haven't learned the lessons of history.  America can get out of debt and lower taxes easily. But with effort.  How?  By doing what we all do. Economize, Cutback and Be Responsible.  Here is a small list.  1. Like all Americans, Congress must put aside their last two pay raises. Cut their staff in half. Only bill one car to the government and give up half their office space (half employees, half space)  2. Freeze all hiring in the National Government. Encourage people to move into the private sector to better jobs, so no one gets fired.   3. Find an already existing government organization which provides no real functions and encourage staff to move on. Take those salaries and reallocate about 100 thousand as prize money to government employees who can come up with cost savings ideas and concepts plans that are accepted and instituted are rewarded with a $10,000 prize. (cost: nothing)  4. Require of all maintenance crews that they become repair and construction 50-50 crews. So that no outside plumbers, electricians, painters, floor people, and construction, it is all done with staff. Some people will have to be let go and more skilled workers hired, or current workers can be retrained. This same policy can and should be followed in all schools, office buildings and training centers owned by the government. Dual-service.  5. You know that book advertised on TV by that crazy guy with the backward question marks all over his suit? Remember it. There is a national governmental body that's well staffed but can do double duty without adding employees or working overtime. Probably lawyers. They can examine that book and all old government functions. Their goal: to rate all these functions from plus ten to minus ten in value to America in their present form and present at first, weekly report to the economics committee and news facilities for comment, public response and resolution.. (Either getting rid of, folding into other functions or cutting staff.)  6. Almost finally, by requiring companies to obey America's minimum wage law and pay minimum wage to any workers outside the country, these companies will bring, probably about half those jobs back to the U.S. and rethink the value of going outside the U.S.  7. Finally (of a short list) requiring people or companies who make above a given amount to pay at least 20 percent of that profit in taxes, no deductions, for below that except real business expansion investment.  What I'm saying is that democrats can still be democrats and cut taxes. Why live with a stigma that wasn't really true in the past and has no need to be true in the future.  Government shouldn't cost this much money ever!  http://www.nealadams.com/

      Iraqi Security Has Come Far, With Far to Go U.S.-Trained Forces Hit by Defections  By Doug Struck Washington Post Foreign Service Sunday, August 1, 2004; Page A18  BAGHDAD -- Five hooded men hopped out of a car at the checkpoint, heavily armed and clearly eager for blood. Iraqi policeman Maytham Talib figured it was time to quit his job.  "Each one of them had an automatic weapon. The police, we had four rifles, but only two worked. We had seven bullets for each rifle. We ran," said Talib, 25. He had already seen two colleagues gunned down at a checkpoint and two others slain by a grenade. He fled, took a bus home and has not been back to work since.  Established by the U.S. occupation authority and trained by foreign troops, Iraq's police and National Guard have been targets of insurgent attacks for months. With the formal end of U.S. occupation, they have been dying in ever larger numbers -- at least 127 have been killed in the last two months. The danger, coupled with low pay, has caused many to quit.  Defections pose a serious obstacle to the rebuilding of Iraq's security forces but not the only one. Planning has been chaotic, units have staged mutinies, and essential equipment has not been delivered. In recent months, the entire process of recruitment and training has been largely scrapped and begun again, and the interim Iraqi government that was installed on June 28 has dictated more changes.  "It was worse than starting from scratch," complained Sabah Kadhim, a top official in the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police. "We had to weed out criminals from the policemen who the Americans put there."  After more than a year under the occupation, Kadhim said, "the police lacked efficiency, lacked organization, lacked cars, lacked weapons, lacked communication. Literally, they didn't have clothing."  Now, Iraqi and U.S. officials insist, the security forces are making progress. They say the police and National Guard are starting to conduct their own raids and perform well under attack. Training camps will soon crank out graduates. The heavy U.S. military presence is gradually shifting to a backup role behind Iraqi forces, they say, and there are plenty of new recruits waiting to take the places of those who quit. Last week, interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi said the emerging security forces were starting to reduce the number of attacks in Iraq.  But his optimistic assessment seemed at odds with the daily drumbeat of mortar attacks, car bombs and ambushes.  "Security is the biggest problem we face," Defense Minister Hazim Shalan said in an interview. "We are working. But if you ask me, am I satisfied, I must say no."  Approximately 225,000 men and some women are listed as serving in the Iraqi security forces -- nearly 88 percent of the recruitment goal. But the numbers are debatable; the police carry 30,000 more names on their payroll than they can account for. Of those who exist, only a fraction have any training, often consisting of a few weeks at a boot camp. Top officials insist they have relatively few resignations -- no reliable figures are available -- but officers on the street say hundreds quit every month after getting their paychecks.  "I'm waiting to finish this month and get my salary, and then I will quit," said Heider Abbas, a policeman in Baghdad who cited low pay. A laborer or shop worker, he said, "gets more than we do."  U.S. planners say Iraqi security forces must be strong enough to fight the insurgency before American troops can withdraw. But the rush to build the forces -- an effort one officer called "30,000 in 30 days" -- led to a crisis in April when Iraqi troops refused to fight.  According to a Government Accountability Office report released last month, nearly 3,000 policemen quit or were removed in one week in mid-April. Among the Iraqi National Guard, desertions ranged from 30 percent in northeastern and central Iraq to 82 percent around the western city of Fallujah, where insurgents battled besieging U.S. Marines. In all, 12,000 soldiers did not show up for duty, according to the report.  "Given the poor performance of the Iraqi security forces during April 2004, it is unclear what level of security they will be able to provide during the period leading up to Iraq's national elections" scheduled for January, the GAO concluded.  Shalan, who became defense minister last month, said the forces had to be rebuilt from the ground up after the April failures. The occupation authority "failed in how they chose people to be employed," he said in an interview last week. "They depended on how a person looked. I think it was whoever the translators liked. That created many of the current problems."  Now, he says, his forces are getting organized. He pointed to a recent sweep through Baghdad's tough Haifa Street neighborhood that resulted in more than 150 arrests and to recent gun battles in which the National Guard stood its ground.  Though U.S. officials envisioned the National Guard as the country's principal domestic armed force, with the army serving as a defense only against external threats, Iraq's new officials have revamped that plan. Allawi announced soon after taking office that the army would be used for domestic security, and Shalan said he expected to transform at least part of the National Guard into the core of a new Iraqi army of six divisions with about 50,000 soldiers. With small air force and marine contingents, he said, Iraq's total armed services would be about 70,000.  Shalan said he is conducting background checks on the guardsmen, who he said number 40,000, and is recruiting more. He would not estimate how many of the current National Guardsmen he thinks will qualify for the army. Those who do not, he said, will become civil servants.  The interim Iraqi government has plans for a proliferation of security agencies in the Middle East tradition of multiple forces that watch each other. The list includes a general security directorate for intelligence, an intervention force, a coastal defense force, an air force, border, customs, immigration and security police, a SWAT team, a facilities protection service and a diplomatic protection service.  The government is also working to get rid of poor hires and nonexistent workers. Though the police force, for example, is paying about 120,000 people, only 87,000 are accounted for, according to British Brig. Andrew Mackay, the coalition adviser for the Iraqi police. "There's a degree of ghosts in there," he said.  Training has gone slowly. For the Iraqi army, only about 3,000 soldiers have been trained and deployed in the field, according to Brig. Gen. James Schwitters, commander of the coalition training team assisting the army. One source of delays has been the lack of adequate training sites for recruits, he said.  Only 6,000 police recruits have received training in a police academy, according to Mackay. Another 21,000 have undergone a three-week training course, he said. At least 60,000 are untrained. To help, Washington has issued a $500 million, two-year contract to train Iraqi police and soldiers in Jordan and has asked NATO for assistance with training.  Schwitters said the training programs would soon start to produce more soldiers. "We will have five battalions by the end of this month, and by the end of the year, 27 battalions," he said.  Mackay, too, is cautiously optimistic about the police.  "The Iraqi Police Service has some way to go before you can really consider them . . . effective," he acknowledged. "They have come a long way. We have given them equipment -- but we haven't given them enough. More needs to come. But they are around. They are visible. They are responding. They are conducting individual operations that they plan themselves, execute themselves, and do the follow-up themselves.  He and other officers cite examples of police stations that come under mortar attack one day and are fully manned the next, of wounded officers returning to work, of applicants still streaming into recruiting offices. "All of that is hugely encouraging," he said. But "there's a lot more that needs to be done."  At a National Guard recruiting office in Baghdad, young men jostle in line to apply. They say they are undeterred by the danger or the low pay.  "I was in the army before," said Hassan Ghrier, 22. "Yes, it's dangerous, but I don't care. And the pay is better than it was before, in the army. Anyway, it's a job."  Zain Ali Abdeen Basl, 22, has completed the first part of his training and is anxious to start working. He slips secretly onto the National Guard base from his home on Haifa Street, where many of his neighbors are insurgents or gangsters. "My neighbors threaten the security forces. But I just want to serve my country," he said.  They are bolstered by the guardsmen nearby. Ali Edan, 23, was shot once while on duty, but "I don't want to quit. I want to protect my country," he said. "I will show my children that I was hurt protecting Iraq. I am proud of that."  Another guardsman, who declined to give his name, described a different reality: "There are a lot of people who want to quit. Last month, we got 250,000 Iraqi dinars [about $170]. This month, we got only 210,000 dinars [$145]. Lots of guys are waiting until the end of the month to see what their pay is, and then they will quit. Our life is in danger out there, and no one takes care of us."  The commander of the base, Lt. Col. Heider Abdul Rasul, was in the Iraqi army's special forces for 20 years. He has about 950 soldiers and a list of 1,500 who are waiting to get in, he said.  Rasul insists he has had only 20 to 30 guardsmen quit since he took over seven months ago. But he added: "I've fired 300 soldiers who were too scared. If I have someone who's scared, I don't want him here."  Rasul is enthusiastic about the "excellent training" the Americans are providing, he said. His men typically get 20 days of training here and 13 days at a National Guard boot camp. But some of the techniques they are taught are frustrating, he said. In a recent gunfight with opponents hiding in high-rise apartment buildings, for example, "the coalition forces told us not to shoot where there are women or children. In the old regime, Saddam would have destroyed the whole neighborhood."  The American soldiers at the base have stepped back from giving orders; they now give advice, they say.  "The Iraqis want to stand up for themselves," said 1st Sgt. William W. Tager, who heads 13 U.S. advisers at the base. "I'm pretty surprised they haven't quit like they did before. They have picked up the ball more. They are a little more confident."  Still, he acknowledged, "it's slow. We know where we want to get them, but they aren't there yet."  Special correspondent Bassam Sebti contributed to this report.
