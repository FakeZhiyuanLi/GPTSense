       After a week that seemed to drag on forever and ever, with it's various ups and downs, finally I can spend a day sitting here relaxing. How's everyone been, those few of you who check in on my blog every now an' then? Hopefully good.   The few people who I talk to at school I've finally spent a second to get to know even a little bit, reducing my anti-sociality. Which is good, to an extent. I still dont like many people I talk to right off, which I definately think should be improved....  A lil example of how could probably be this one chick, who liked me, and I did, but very little. Nothing went on, thank god, because for some reason I know, but don't at the same time [hard to explain]-- I can't stand talking to her for more than 3 seconds. That's probably going similarly for her, in which I wouldnt mind so much if I  did  have a shard of compassion and conscience within me. I openly show her how I cant stand her, but at the same time I feel bad, because if I wasn't such an ass I'd be in on being her friend. Hopefully this summer break'll ease that, so I can go back to school and be nice to her for the short amount of time she claims she'll be there...make up for my assholery. Confusing?   On a totally different side of things, my  urlLink friend  , who may or may not have mentioned it as you read this, told me about a new technology aiming to replace CD's and DVD's. It's called  urlLink Info-MICA , and it's about the size of a postage stamp. Definately something worth checking out if you're into that kinda thing.   Well, I don't have much else to talk about, for now. I can hear your sighs of relief as you read that. Heheh.

       I havent posted in a few days.   That changes. Now.  Hah, anyways, I'm getting more and more stoked for the Rush 30th anniversary concert I'm going to. The date they come to my area isn't till August, but I'm already getting psyched, and I ended up abandoning all other bands I listen to for the sake of learning the lyrics to every Rush song I can get my slender fingers on. I can't wait!  Things are picking up again, really this time. I dunno why, it's probably some kind of astral thing I'm not seeing. Well, as long as things keep turning good for me and the other people who don't suck, it's gonna be ill. I still can't wait for the end of the school year too, so I can stop being a lazy bastard, in most ways.   I've been doing alot of unnecessary thinking too, not so much about chicks as I used to, sheez they plagued my mind. Thank god it's over. Now, it's just more about trying to fit the most amount of possible things to do in the tiny amount of time I'm home from school every weekday, and managing that time so after this year, I'll be able to do it next year. Especially since Aqua Teen Hunger Force keeps me up laughing at night, and I end up sleeping in school, and at the computer desk.  Anyways, Mike out.    ......I'm takin you to court. You know who you are. *Evil snicker*

       Yeah, so Jim's Big Ego is one of my favorite bands, and they have this song. It totally describes me. So! Here ya go!  Stress Jim's Big Ego  Lyrics: Chorus: I'm Addicted to stress its the way that I get things done if I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long and I hang around like a bum and I think Im goin nowhere and that makes me nervous  Repeat  Everybodys out to get me but I feel alright Repeat x3 Everybodys thinkin bout me  (It's the little things that get you its the little things that get you when you werent payin' attention)  Repeat  Tryin to cut down on my caffeine consumption so when I get up I just have one cup of coffee and id like to have another cup of coffee with my breakfast and on the way to work I like to get a cup of coffee I like the kind of cup of coffee you get with your donuts but I never get the donut I just have the cup of coffee And when I get to work I have a cup of coffee cause I like a cup of coffee when im talking on the phone but it usually gets cold and I need to get another cup of coffee And its lunch, and I have an espresso  So when I get back its not morning anymore so I have a diet cola and another diet cola And by then I'm feelin fine im feelin pretty sharp and I'm feelin pretty wired and I'm gettin things done But right about 2 I get this little tiny micronim stuck behind my eyes and it moves to the back of my neck and it moves to the bottom of my spine but it doesnt get there til 5 or 6 o clock-- Which is the end of the day so I'm fine so I'm fine so I'm FINE-- Except when I have to work late....when I have to work late... which I usually do  Chorus  I love to work i love to run I love to play it real hard I love to steal little things from the grocery store-- like a piece of bubble gum or sometimes I just stick my thumb in a peach-- and leave it there I love to work I love to run I love to waterski snowboard jetski skydive parasail handglide rollerblade mountainbike bungee jump well I mean I'd love to do these things if I ever had the time I love to work I love to work I love to work right after work I love to spend a little time with this woman that I'm seein cause we never get the time to spend together-- so we call each other up and we talk about work But I think I'd really love is to get up by myself on a little tiny island in the middle of the ocean with just me, a book, and a cellular phone-- and a personel computer in case something came up and I'd eat and I'd drink and I'd run and I'd sleep and do nothing but swim all day-- Except I dont know how to do laps in the ocean...-- where are the sharks where are the SHARKS And theres this kind of anemone that sticks in your foot-- and the poison goes up to your brain and you DIE And sand fleas...SAND FLEAS yuck! But actually I think would be really relaxing just me by myself in the middle of the ocean and thats what Id really like to do more than anything else-- Except I'd probably hate it  Chorus mix

       Is one of the illest songs EVER!  And it looks like Jonny believed Joe, and a few other people. That's a shame, man, I thought Dan was cool? What's going on with everyone, including myself? Everyone's changed.  It's probably the end of the school year that's doing it to everyone. It'll pass I think.   Anyways, shit's still goin good, weather's nice, and I'm gettin ready for summer vacation by prepping my summer sleep schedule.   Sleep: 4am Wake up: 10am-1pm ish  Damn right I'm a lazy bastard.

       So yeah, I overslept *wink wink* today, and missed the school bus. All day my lazy ass has been sitting here, and I've been doing nothing but playin video games, filling up on soda, and surfin the net for pointless shit. This is what I call a good day. A real milestone.  Although it might not seem like I'm in a good mood when you talk to me, I'm actually really happy. School's drawing to a close, and I get to just be a lazy bastard today.   Right now? No reason to be openly pissed.  A friend of mine was telling me about this crush, and he's a crazy bastard too. He likes her, not the other way around, cause he's like that eerie kid you don't talk to, cause you think he's gonna mug you or something. It's great, he like unintentionally freaks everyone out that he comes in contact with. I wanna like ask him if he has a mental issue.   Anyways, I'm gonna go wander around on the internet again, Later.

       Today was a pretty damn good day compared to the last few weeks I've had. I got all new classes, and things are finally starting to look up. And I'm happy the year's almost over.  Today I hung out with my friends, and as much as I feel wiped out, it was some good times. Definately fun. I went on a claiming frenzy.  Well, I'm going to go lay down now.

       So my weekend slowly draws itself to a close. The school year's almost over. People I know, if I choose to keep my lazy ways, will probably never see me again, or not until the end of summer. I gotta get off my lazy ass and start hangin out more, I think.   On that note, before turning this into a rant, I've decided to restart work on this game I'm programming with RPGMaker. It seems simple enough, the game that is...and the programming is a sinch. But since the whole work is a bunch of works in progress at once, it's hard to get much done when your story is only so far, or the music is only half done.  But eventually, the job'll get done. I hope. God I want popeye's chicken.

       I guess all that friend issue crap is straightened out. That's good, eh?  The weekends take too long to get here, and when they finally bring themselves my way, they zoom through.... Like Christmas. 'Tis time for more lyrics, I think. Judging by rough translation, maybe they fit the current issues of my life somehow? I could be wrong.  Anyone who can fully translate this song, lemme know.  Latin Simone (que pasa contigo) vocals by Ibrahim Ferrer and lyrics by Lazaro Villa  Dejalo si quieres continuar (hermano) Sal ilumina tu vida, todo el cielo aplatandote Dime que hares (intentalo) Ilumina ese amore, antes que se vaya  Algo siempre te entristese Cuando todo va bien Que pasa contigo? Alga siempre te entristese Cuando todo va bien Que pasa contigo? Que pasa contigo?  Dejalo si quieres continuar No ocultes tu alma al sol Tienes una vida preciosa De que sirve si solo Mueres suavemente  Que pasa? Que pasa contigo? Que pasa contigo mi hermano? Que pasa contigo? Escucha a tue propia voz Salva tu amore Que pasa contigo? Antes que se vaya Si todo va bien Que pasa contigo? Que pasa contigo? Mirate a ti mismo, enfrentalo Que pasa contigo mi hermano? Ven animate Que pasa contigo?

       I know the movie's been out for a while now, but I just saw Willard. What a great flick. Seeing as I'm not a big movie-theater kinda guy, I suggest all 3 people who still havent seen it to check it out.   That being said....  I'm trying to find ways to lift my mood up. This morning I woke up in a shitty mood, feeling angry and frustrated at what, well, at the time, was nothing. You know. One of those days. Then the whole stupid friendship lying/gloating thing from who may or may not still be my friend annoyed the piss outta me more, and it just seemed as though what looked to be a day of relaxing at home in front of the computer would be a day of misdirected anger and pent up feelings. He obviously got pissed at me, to which current extent I've lost my interest in, as everyone has a right to "One of those days". Sure that isnt much of an excuse, as it isnt supposed to be. If Mike wants to stay mad at me he can, if not, he doesnt have to. Fuck getting angry now. It's not even worth getting pissed over something like this or anything anymore, because...well...it just isn't.   I'm not going to apologize though, because I'm only going over what I'm thinking. If someone wants to get pissed about my views, then they don't have to listen to me. I don't make anyone do anything. I also don't expect, nor want, an apology for anything, by anyone, for any reason. Not really, anymore. Whatever happens happens from now on.  I have a feeling I'll forget I said that..  Well now, to ease my thoughts and calm my frazzled nerves, I got Rush playing, with the tv off and the fan on hi....trying to just calm myself down. Something got me unnecessarily riled up, and I wanna reverse it. Sure, the legit reasons I'm mad about are still there, but since I'm trying not to sweat the issues, well... Yeah. I could use a light drink and an island palace.  And a nap.

       So I had the worst past couple of weeks ever.  The last one wasnt as bad as the others, but it still sucked.  Problems with chicks are turning more into trivialities. I like both of them as a friend, and I don't care if the time were to come where I'd eventually end up going out with one of said chicks. But it seems to me [sure I could and most likely be wrong..] they're making me choose.  A friend of mine who graduated decides to gloat all about his prom to me while my away message last night decides to magially have me return, so I wake up to a "talking to himself" conversation that contains him going on and on about how he was prom king and how he almost had anal with this chick and how he made out with random big tittied chicks too. I REALLY don't care about who, how, and when you're gonna score with a chick, Mike, [Yes his name is Mike too] just like I would imagine you not to care what I did either.  The only good thing is that I didnt do too bad this half-markin' period. Other than that I really dont know what the hell I'm supposed to do with minimal, yes, but annoying all the same, problems that are piling up on top of these. I have no idea what I want. Its like I'm losing friends, and its probably my fault. Usually everything is. I'm used to it.  Oh well, I guess....

       So my friend  urlLink Steamincow  is over here saying that this guy we know, Joe, is telling him that he's trying to get another friend's girl...or something. Check that out  urlLink here.  Anyways...I hate the guy. Joe, that is. He's a dipshit ignorant asshole, always lying. Not that kinda liar where it's like, slanderous, but, like, the kinda guy who's like OMGWTFBBQOLOLZ I SAW THIS GUY LIKE HAVE A HEART ATTACK AND HIS HEAD BLEW UP YOU TOTALLY BELIEVE ME...... Yeah. And you can never tell when he's joking and when he isnt all "olol anus". So Jonny better not believe Joe.  Anyways, again, I'm just sitting here, bored out of my mind, with music on. I saw SLC Punk today, and its already one of my most favorite movies ever. That shit is so fucking hardcore. You hafta check that out.  I'm totally Heroin Bob.     He never did drugs a day in his life, but he's still such a stoner.

       I need something to do, I'm so bored right now. It's cooled down a little since the earlier days of the week....so I can go outside..but school wiped me out these past two weeks. Between crap from everyone and just all around stress, I usually end up going home, sitting there, and falling asleep at the keyboard, only to wake up and find that I drooled on my spacebar.  The only things that are keeping me relatively sane are my music, games, and the occasional skate session.  I should go take a nap now...

       It's been like, 86 degrees almost all week, and really humid. Every day, around 6-7 pm, it gets really cloudy, like it's going to rain. But it doesn't, it just stays all gloomy outside until morning, where it'll look all sunshiney and do the same thing the next day.  This, as I've come to conclude, is bullshit.  I don't mind the cloudy, grey, weather, as the few of you who've been keeping up with me may have come to know, but the fact that it stays such a warm temperature without even a dose of relief is beginning to drive me mad.  RAIN ALREADY, GODDAMMIT.... So I can go do that thinking thing. I really need it.

       These lyrics aren't mine. This is a song, Animate, By  urlLink Rush , my favorite band. This is one of my favorite songs by them, and its also kinda for someone I know.  "Animate"  Polarize me Sensitize me Criticize me Civilize me Compensate me Animate me Complicate me Elevate me  Goddess in my garden Sister in my soul Angel in my armor Actress in my role  Daughter of a demon lover Empress of the hidden face Priestess of the pagan mother Ancient queen of inner space  Spirit in my psyche Double in my role Alter in my image Struggle for control  Mistress of the dark unconscious Mermaid of the lunar sea Daughter of the great enchantress Sister to the boy inside of me  My counterpart, my foolish heart A man must learn to rule his tender part A warming trend, a gentle friend A man must build a fortress to defend A secret face, a touch of grace A man must learn to give a little space A peaceful state, a submissive trait A man must learn to gently dominate  Polarize me Sensitize me Criticize me Civilize me Compensate me Animate me Complicate me Elevate me

       Ever just look up at the sky, and shut yourself off from the world?  You know, when it's a grey-skyed afternoon in spring or summer, and you can smell the rain coming. And if you can, you sit, and delve yourself as deep into your psyche as humanly possible? To unlock doors you hadnt opened in what felt like a millenia, and to go from instant self-induced highs from good times past, to rock bottom lament because of things you should'nt have thunk of. In a way, you talk to yourself, within the recesses of your mind, trying to make even the tiniest, most insignificant thing imaginable have a purpose, things you noticed on your walk to wherever it is you may sit to do such aforementioned thinking.   You replay the scenes you'd been thinking of over and over in your head, traumatically, as if trying to find a railing to hang on in your mentality as the floor falls from you because you think you're going insane. Overthinking. All the time. It's becoming your saving grace, and the knife that will eventually slay you. Maybe, if this person seems like it's you, you blink, having pulled yourself from that metaphysical trance, no longer weaving in and out of the souls you interacted with. The second you blink, almost cinematically, the grey clouds you may have been looking up at, let out a drop of rain on your face, before the weather patterns that seemed nothing more than annoyance in your extensively-busy-seeming life push the rest of the precipitation onto you.  Life telling you to get over yourself, there's plenty of time for another session like this again, and fate will decide when it'll be.  Things may or may not seem clearer to you, next time around. But at the moment, it doesnt seem like that's the point of things, as you might have reasoned lots of stuff over while staring seemingly emptily at the sky. Maybe if this is something you picture yourself easily doing, having such a retrospect with your own mentality, then maybe I am you....

       There's these people I know. All they want from me is to waste my time. Every five minutes, it's someone saying "Mike, come here for this", or "Mike, come let me complain to you about that". Noone cuts a guy a break. Everyone wants a slice of my time, or my patience, by getting emotional over trivial things, or by calling on my assistance when it's unnecessary.  Sure, it sounds a little selfish of me to complain about that kind of thing, seeing as there's obviously more significant problems to deal with on this mess of a planet, but how does anyone expect me to remain sane, so I can continue to be ordered around and treated like a lapdog, evidently, when the aforementioned fools won't let me have 5 minutes to recollect myself? All I ask is time to think. Time to have some peace and quiet. Apparently everything's one sided enough to just keep pushing me.  People try my patience with their trivial issues about "baby's momma's drama" and "why in the hell dont you have my drug money?" Maybe if I showed these people what the hell was wrong with them instead of them pointing out what was wrong with me, instead of them ordering me around like I was their lackey, I give them something to do?

       It sounds like the folks at  urlLink Google  are being hassled over their new email service,  urlLink Gmail . I don't see the problem that these supposed 32 anti-gmail companies are.  One particular anti-google organization, aptly named  urlLink Google-Watch , is closely monitoring the actions that Google takes to try and make points against it. They've already whinily bitched about Google's very useful PageRank system, which will be implemented into the Gmail service. They say that PageRank is useless inside Gmail's system, and they also try to prove how intrusive it is.  People, this is an automated service. Noone's going to directly look into your emails and send information or ads through your mail. This is just a computer trying to give you possibly helpful info based on the simple text of your messages. It scans the email once, retrieves links associated to your mail, and throws the information it retrieved in the scan away.  There's nothing to be scared of.  There's also the politicians aiming their bureaoucratical cannons at Gmail, complaining about the same issues. But they also    say that the scan is more intrusive than Google seems to say it is, whereas, it's almost the same exact premise as the virus-scanning doohickeys that  urlLink Yahoo!  and  urlLink Hotmail  use. It's just used for a different purpose.  There really shouldn't be a reason to complain about such a promising product, especially since there will forever be other free email services to use out there as an alternative. If you don't like the deal Google offers you, then don't take it. Keep your Yahoomail. When the doors to Gmail open to the public, if ever, more people than the protesters think will be chomping at the bit to get ahold of their own accounts.

       I'm not entitled to get angry, or upset, or anything like that.  Just letting you know.  There's a really bad penalty if I do, though, so if you should see me carrying emotion, do your worst.   Because I'll hurt.  And that'll lead you to punish me more.

       I spent like four days at my aunts house, where it's like fucking suburbia but no kids. Had nothing to do, and was forced to go to some church too. I cant believe I'm back in my old shitty house, in my old shitty neighborhood. I actually miss it.   Well...  I at least miss the computer.

       Not blogged, bogged.  Missing two days on the computer and trying very hard to resolve my problems are leading to lots and lots of rushing. I'm not particularly upset anymore, because my issues can be fixed. I can only post a little bit, namely, what you're reading now, for the time being, any of those who even read this blog anymore, because I'm still on the busy side. When I post next, hopefully tomorrow, I'll try and make it nice and interesting for people to start reading again, heheh.

       I spent the weekend at my aunt's house, a place at first I'd thought I wouldnt want to be. But due to a (Bad? Good?) twist of fate, it seems I'm a little less morbid-feeling than usual. I still have the problems on my mind that are making me upset; problems that lots of people would ask me what they were and just would laugh at their opinion of said issue's "silly"-ness. All the same, despite my unresolved issues which I refuse to elaborate on so publicly, I feel a little better. The escape from my troubles, if only for a weekend, enhanced my mood on a monolithic scale, if only temporarily. I'll be able to tackle my challenges with a little more ease, knowing I took a break from worrying about them (mostly).   Anyways, back to the daily summer grind of preoccupying myself with not only these issues, but to tackle on more useless distractions such as message boards and roleplaying. Yes, roleplaying. Hopefully things look up, despite my pessimistic disposition.

       I was gonna open up another blog, and chronicle the days of summer as they went by. Of course this would be a little redundant from this blog, seeing as I talk about things that happened to me every other day (and seeing as it's summer, and nothing'll happen, you get the picture). Maybe it'd be useful for someone who has that kinda capability.   I  almost  went to go see Chronicles Of Riddick today.  I didn't.  It's so great that it's summer vacation, but as much as I hated going to school, at least there were people to talk to there. Even those who I couldn't stand held reason for me to be around in a delapidated way, now I have noone to argue with except my mom. And skating with the same couple of people every day won't exactly cure my boredom either.   But rather than let this turn into a rant.....  I'm thinking I should go out and do something.  ........  Maybe later.

       Three months of sitting on my ass, sleeping in, eating cereal at all hours of the day, and skateboarding. It's such a rush already, and I've only been free 12 hours.  Something tells me I should plan out my summer, but since all I have to look forward to is Rush's 30th anniversary concert, does anything else really matter?  O_o

       Well, it's the beginning of summer vacation for me, whoo. I'm sleeping in and skating the months away, and I'll appreciate it, cause last year I spent the heated days in summer school.  Anyway, all I did was kick ass in Halo today, and enjoy the temperate afternoon. Now it's time to stay up late and start looking up tech shit on this shared blog about  urlLink tech stuff/media  betwixt me and my friend  urlLink Jonny.   Anyways, I dunno what else'll be going on right this second, so I'll probably be back later.

       Yeah, so I'm home today. Hopefully I can do some hangin' out or something, although I don't think that'll be very possible cause it's gonna be like 90 degrees out and all humid.  As usual there's really nothing to do, cause it's Connecticut. The boredom capitol of the world.  Something'll happen though.....I still hope. Recently I've been getting into Doom/Doom 2 mods, and I've been playing the game alot lately. Probably out of my boredom. It's still fun though.  Anyway, it's time to go sleep or play games or eat or something. Later.

       Today was alright. Got to take a nap, things went smoothly. Can't really think of anything new, which is completely boron....but it's okay cause something'll happen that'll be exciting, I hope.

       Just because I act like an idiot in public doesn't mean I don't have intelligence. I just don't tolerate you anymore.  Whether or not you think the same way, or anyone else sees it, you're an asshole. Soon as your end to your highschool career [and it was a career, seeing as you kept coming AFTER you graduated] You became unfunny, pointless, and in lots of ways, illogical. Noone cared about your debates on religion no matter what their grounds on the topic was, and not many people seemed to tolerate you to a level higher than mine to begin with.  I, for one, am glad you left, and am fed up with yours, and plenty of other people's, crap. People who feel the same can keep feeling that way, perhaps through our mutual hate we can become friends.  I had to clear this up, because it was necessary to voice my opinion on you as you seem to have eloquently done in your blog.   How is everyone else doing? ^_^

       I feel so lost. Not necessarily bad lost, but, lost all the same. I don't know what I'm doing, at least not at the moment. This feeling'll probably pass soon, I hope. I never felt this way, like I feel cornered...  On another note, I've nothing to do, and noone to talk to. Going outside is a great option...that is to say, I'm too tired to... And that isnt an excuse. Almost every day for the past 2-3 weeks I go home and almost immediately take a nap. I dont even remember mentioning that, which I probably did.... Oh well. Rambling is fun.

       There's a toddler that  really  wants the cookie jar on that really high up shelf, but isn't  quite tall enough  to reach it..  And he devises plans to get those cookies. Standing on a chair, nope.  Not quite tall enough . Asks for help, with his unheard, irrelevant voice.. maybe the toddler cries.  But those who see his attempts to get just  one simple cookie , one little thing that he'd like to even be temporarily happy, those people see him plea and shrug it off.   He only wants some attention, those cookies mean nothing to him.   What.. if that cookie did? He wants to be happy, that lil kid.. Just give him what he wants.. this once? What is this an analogy to? I'm not telling...

       Every time I post lyrics to a song noone reads them, but I could give two shits this time. These are from Anthem, a Rush song.  Not that shitty Good Charlotte garbage.    Know your place in life is where you want to be  Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me  Keep on looking forward, no use in looking 'round  Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you  down    Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind  A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind  We marvel after those who sought  New wonders in the world, wonders in the world,  Wonders in the world they wrought    Live for yourself -- there's no one else  More worth living for  Begging hands and bleeding hearts will  Only cry out for more    Well, I know they've always told you  Selfishness was wrong  Yet it was for me, not you, I  Came to write this song    Well, I just felt like putting  that. Anyone has something to say about it, go ahead, although I'll doubt that anyone'll care what it means.

       So I'll just write.  Went to the beach today, no chicks to keep my eyes company AT ALL. Where did they go? Probably found me coming and ran off to another beach. Also got a scanner, too. Now more pictures (maybe on request) will come in. If I don't get raped with requests, I'll draw something that you want me to, provided my talent allows it.     Had some fun at the shores of Misquamicut (I'm not sure how it's spelled) despite the lack of chicks. Friend of mine, Tim, had a little noisemaking gadget that said things like "Fuck you!" and "You're an asshole!". So of course we played around with that the whole time.     No chicks at the beach means no OTHER chicks at the beach. 2 hotties went with us, and although they were way outta at least my league (not that I'd go for it anyway) they still had us laughing and stuff during the times that toy wasn't spouting off obscenities.    That's it for now, see ya later people.

       That way I wouldn't freaking die from the heat.    Noone reads this anymore. No big deal, I don't really read a whole hell of alot of other people's blogs. But it sounds like a good thing to do. Hm.    Got some pictures scanned. For privacy, (No, they aren't like porno or anything, just dont want them being stolen or some crap..) anyone who wants to see them can contact me (unlikely) and I'll get the two pics to you. Planning on getting more scanned somehow.    Here's a recap of what's been up.         Dank's got problems. I can only advise you so far, man.     Irene says she'd be cool with hangin out anytime after 1pm. Rad.     Jonny's all over the Blogosphere. Jonny_D, people. Look out for him. He's everywhere. Like P.Diddy was last year.     Christina's in some church camp hangin around. Hope she brought enough makeup..     Carlos, think about breaking off from chicks for a while. You'll eventually lose the need for a stress ball. I wish I had your problems. Kinda.     Mike Carroll, still, I must say. Fuck you. ^_^     Becca's off in Canadia (I can spell the damn word, don't condescend) ....And apparently, she's hating it.  Sucks, eh?    Oh.    And the Rush tour is in less than 3 weeks. Goooood times.    Anything I missed? You know how to get ahold of me. Even if I barely know you, I'll put it up if it's interesting/funny. Time for someone else's rant to replace mine, you know?    Hopefully this blog won't be as dead in September. Hopefully none of you who read it died.  Anyways, see ya.

        I woke up this morning, with no intention to do anything. Kind of against the thing about changing. But quite against my summer role to be a lazy bastard, I ended up going to Dank's! And getting a couple new pictures I drew up scanned, at that. We cracked some jokes, played some games, and I was on my merry way. Almost immediately after changing into my houseclothes with plans of staying home and not sweating anymore, an old friend of mine and a newer one both come to my door, and we skate and bike around town for a while. Man, what a good day. I'm so exhausted, though. It's so fucking hot.    But it's cool, eventually I'm gonna find more reasons to hang out and stuff. To my surprise, there were actually no hot chicks out today. Maybe that's just cause we hung around a different part of town. I bet if the three of us had gone to Stop N Shop we woulda been seeing some hot chicks.       Hmm.

       And lemme tell you, the Wayans could have done much better. I mean come on guys, you make awesome movies! I barely chuckled...  They tried too hard on making a story this time. It ended up boiling down to one of those preteen girly type movies with a "meek-girl-gets-empowered through motivated friends" theme, but with essentially adding 2 black guys who try to add funny and only SEEM like they're detrimental to the plot.  Seriously.   Shawn and Marlon Wayans both play FBI agents who apparently often screw up their assignments,  and are on the verge of being fired until their hotheaded boss gives them a rather simple assignment noone else will take.    Take two snotty rich girls in potential danger of being kidnapped, and escort them from their private jet to their hotel in the Hamptons.  Easy, right?  No.   The Wayans brothers get into a little slipup, of course to further the rather weak comedic plot. The rich girls' dog ends up nearly falling out of the car, forcing the two agents to pull over rather bumpily, leading to the girls' massive injuries of, you guessed it, a bleeding lip and cut nose.  The girls refuse to go to their party in the hamptons with a couple bandaids on their face, and they want to complain to the FBI chief about it. The two FBI agents, knowing they can't screw up again, end up convincing the two prissy girls to stay in another hotel nearby and stay there secretly, which would of course halt their plans but keep them safe, resulting in not getting fired. End of story, in reality. Shawn Wayans decides this isn't enough of a movie, because surely noone will pay for a 20 minute film, and in the two girl's stead he has himself and his partner get done up of course like the white chicks.  Actually there is reasoning behind this, because the two officers believe they might be able to stop the potential criminal and get back on the boss's good side. And there's two other officers, who add a good portion of the comedy (and not much else) by going back and forth asking each other things like, "Who would you do, Carmen Electra? Or Pam Anderson? The catch is, they both have yeast infections!"  Soon after they get to this revelation, the movie quickly gets less funny, unfortunately, and the plot gets confusing. The two new white chick replacements go through the usual "man in drag for the first time" problems, such as wearing tight pants and walking on heels, and they make friends with the actual girl's buddies. Blah blah blah, sappy womany friendship, blah blah, criminals found, FBI agents save the day, yadda yadda.   At first what seemed like such a promising film ended up being one of the most mediocre comedies ever written, especially by the Wayans brothers. It's almost saddening.   All the same, if you're into nonsensical plots behind squealing teenage rich chicks and two black Mrs Doubtfires, go ahead and see it. It wasn't the best movie for damn sure, but I suppose someone will appreciate it more than I did..  Better luck next time, Mr. Wayans?

       I've got to move, pick up my feet, get ahead.                     Make the first step. Be the one to incite the war with myself.                                                 Gonna make some changes, bumpy roads ahead.  But I'm not sweatin' a thing. Gonna do it all one step at a time, y'see? Nothin big a'first, yaknow, but the further you and me move along the more copasetic things will get. Goooooooooood changes.   "She packed my bags, last night, pre-flight, zero hour, 9am And i'm gonna be high... As a kite by then...  And i think it's gonna be a long long time till touch down brings me round again to find, I'm not the man they think I am at home, Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man Rocket man burning out his fuse out here... alone  And I think it's gonna be a long long time till touch down brings me round again to find, I'm not the man they think I am at home, Oh no, no, no, I'm a rock-et man Rocket man burning out his fuse out here alone" - Stewie  You wanna come with me?   You dont hafta.   "There's a shadow on the road behind, there's a shadow on the road ahead, nothin' can stop you now" - Rush  Really though, it's time for some improving, and I know you think I need to change my programming lineup.  Cause I know I do.

       How's everyone? Hopefully good. I've been alright, things have been going on, meh. Fireworks go on today, and I wanted to get a shot to go, and I passed up on it cause I wasnt feeling up for it. I regret it now, because I need something to pick up this feeling of depressedness I suddenly have.  Been trying to keep optimistic, and I've been planning to go somewhere tomorrow, hang out with a couple friends. Really hoping I get to go.   Anyways, just thought I'd say that, cuz, yaknow, just wanted to.   See you people later.

       Wake up.  Listen to Rush.  Watch Rush In Rio DVD.  Go see Rush for 3 1/2 hours+.  I sang 28 out of 31 songs, songs I had either had or picked up from knowledge of a setlist I found that was very accurate. Goddammit, they didn't play Leave That Thing Alone. But it was okay, because Neil's new drum solo kicked so much fucking ass it made up for it.  Geddy of course was spot on, almost all the tunes sounded like they came from the albums.  The  movies throughout the show were hilarious. *does the macarena*  Oh yeah. Alex's Strangiato rant was so intensely random it was crazy. Fuckin' funny stuff.  "Nahnah-nah-nah-nah nahhh"  And his guitarring was sublime. I didn't know someone could tear up the strings like that. His playing is inhuman!  Well, since I'm so hyped I can't really think straight, I'll pro'lly post more clearly about everything later. See you people later.

       Had another "Lonely streak" today.  They seem to get worse the more they happen..  And they're occuring more often.   But in other news...   The concert is tomorrow. Yay.  I'd be much happier if I didn't feel this way so frequently. It sucks.  And to think, I can't even say what I have to say exactly, because people are starting to read this again.  The irony.  Oh well. Shit happens, I suppose.   Even if I found someone to live for, I'd still be separated from them.. How unfair...

       Woke up to her complaining...  again.   Sick of her shit. Always bitching. Nagging. Needs to be silenced.  "Go get a job!" "Not 16 yet." "I don't care, you go get one now!"  Not because the extra money could help. Not to show me the value of a dollar, help me if I didn't know that.  She's just being a selfish lil prick. It's almost always about her.    Tribute, because hearing the song makes things a little bit better.    The song we sang, on that fateful night, didn't actually sound anything like this song!
