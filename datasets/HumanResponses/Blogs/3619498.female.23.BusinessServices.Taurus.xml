      anyone who chooses a cat over a dog is emotionally questionable...at this point i probably would have a major precent of the population waiting to pounce on me. i was previously a cat owner and the satisfaction i got from owning one could not compete with having a cute brown and white dog named jlo. corny name huh? choosing a name for whatever species leaves me completely drained, defenseless, and depressed. I'm an OC in decision making, and the fact that names are a lifetime, permanent decision didn't help ease the pressure. i wanted something unique and classy and personalized. i didn't want a name that only sounded good, it had to make sense as well. the name and the subject should complement each other. after seeing the pup's butt shake a lot as she walked, we decided to name her after the butty jennifer lopez. it doesn't mean we are jlo fans. we are, but we fancy the dog more than the singer.  cats are prima donnas. dogs are your fan club presidents. enuff said.

      before you think that im some slave, let me tell u that i am in manila for a vacation. turns out, i was appointed as the unsuspecting shopper of my family, who are stuck in zamboanga. i was planning on spending the rest of the day window shopping, wandering aimlessly in glorietta/greenbelt/landmark/sm, when several texts found their way to my cellphone. "Buy me this, buy me that..." Born without a sense of direction (i could get lost anywhere, no matter how small the place is), i had to wear my feet out trying to locate one damned shop after the other. ugh. It was a nightmare.   Landmark exchange policies are the worst. a few days ago, i spotted this folding umbrella and unsuspectingly bought it, only knowing of its defective state when i arrived home. I know, i know, i should have opened it while i was still in the store premises, however, i was in a hurry that time, and THAT should be a valid excuse. The process of getting one credit memo slip, or whatever they call it, is as long as the pathways of china's great wall. i had to wait as the saleslady attending me had to travel the whole building just to look for a supervisor. after finding one, apparently she was told to go to another floor and locate where the item was purchased----and then, she had to find another supervisor, etc. let me tell you, finding a landmark supervisor is a one-in-a-million chance. not even the sales attendants know where they hide. not very convenient for us shoppers. anyway, that took up about 2 hours of my time!!!!! at least, they didnt refuse to have the broken umbrella exchanged! if they had, i would have turned red..and in a cowardly fashion, just left!hehe. seriously, i would have put up a rally right then and there(ows)! truthfully though,  i hate confrontations. i hate people who provoke them! ugh.  the landmark fiasco took place after my feet were battered from walking the ayala and makati avenue trying to find a decent condo near aim, which is where i would probably study come july. i find asia towers the most convenient and more to my taste. the convenience of it being located next to aim is its winning edge.   aim or lsal??????? i know aim's supposed to be number one in mba, but lasalle's not that far behind. i live right across lsalle!!! should it be the more practical choice? it costs way less than aim. aim's tuition in itself is a nightmare, added to that would be the xpense of having to rent a unit near it. still, lsalle offers night classes only..what would i do the rest of the day? sleep? shopping could be boring when practiced daily. work? i dont like mixing work with studying, that wouldnt leave me with enough time to make papers, etc. HELP
