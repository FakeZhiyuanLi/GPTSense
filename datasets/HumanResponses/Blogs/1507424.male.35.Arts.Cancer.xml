      My search for work in the Texas film industry  led me to the door of first-time film producer/director Jesse  Petrick, who put me to work as 1st Camera Assistant on his project,  entitled  urlLink "Heathens" .  On this project I was able to put many of the skills that I have  developed for still photography and commecial video projects  to work. However, when it came down to having the right tool  for the job, I came up short ­ I am not field-equipped with  a corkscrew. Back to the hardware store I go...


Projects left on hold during the film include  two albums for local hip-hop artists, as well as ads and promotional  art for my best clients. My apologies to each of you as I get  back into gear at my desk. Thank you for your patience.


July may see me on the road again for a  couple of weeks, while I toil on a brainchild for indpendent  video producer/documentarian  urlLink David Garrigus  .

      Reconstruction of my website will be underway soon, I hope. Registering with a new host has inspired me to pick up where I left off. I have more content and many more samples of new work to post, so stay tuned.

Leon Quenneville continues to promise payment, but no check has materialized.

My part-time job is working out as I expected -- most of my coworkers are of a fairly sour demeanor. That's probably due to the combination of odd or excessive hours for very, very low pay. I am relieved that it's only a part-time job, because I doubt that I could stand their company for more than my currect schedule prescribes. I said that most of them are sour, but some are not. In fact, a handful of them are somewhat pleasant, but that may be because they are among the slightly higher-paid members of the group. It may also be because they have long since taken leave of their senses, but I'd prefer to think otherwise. My job uses about five percent of my ability, and it pays just about five percent of what I am accustomed to getting paid, so I can't really complain, unless they ask me to turn up the magic.

      Hostsave wasted no time, at all in cancelling my account. If only they were so adamant about fixing all of the problems that I had with them, I would not have cancelled the account! It was a little close, as the nameservers are just now adjusting and picking up calls to my domain name, but I am sure that everything will be better than ever in just a bit.

      I wasn't going to do this, but I have no choice but to comment on the fact that a producer who contracted with me on a freelance job has not lived up to his promise to pay. A couple of weeks ago, Leon Quenneville, of On-Q Productions, a video production company based in Scottsdale, Arizona contacted me to shoot a project for him. It was a last-minute deal, and I didn't want to slow down his project with a lot of paperwork and credit verification. Well, it may have cost me the value of the tapes and the time spent shooting and shipping the tapes to him. He had promised to pay up on the following week. When I contacted him to check on the hold-up, he suggested that the funds were on hold, but that payment would be sent via priority mail. Enough time has passed for payment to have arrived, so I can only suspect the worst, and warn others about working for him. When and if payment arrives, I will update this commentary to reflect that payment has arrived, but this cautionary note will remain in place. Sorry, Leon, but it was all up to you to take care of this matter. The fact that you have not paid up means that you pose a liability to those whom you would have work with you.

      For the last four days, my hosting service (Hostsave.com) has been under a Denial of Service attack (DOS), resulting in the unavailability of this blog and my entire website. At less than eight dollars a month, Hostsave was a pretty good deal, until I factored in the downtime from technical issues, such as the DOS attack. That, coupled with their sad excuse for tech support and customer service, led me to seek out hosting elsewhere. So, in the next few days, my site will be migrated over to another host, and we'll see what comes of it.

We're going to check out the latest Jim Carrey movie today. I normally don't waste time with his brand of humor, but I am up for a laugh, and one reviewer (Joel Siegel - GMA) promised a few laughs over the silliness that the film offers. If nothing else, it's 100 minutes of air conditioning for nine bucks. 

I'd like to spend a little time pouring over my thoughts regarding my part-time job, but out of reluctance to expose my employer and my desperation for a regular pay check, I probably won't say much, at all. I can only bring myself to say that I work some odd hours for very low pay, no benefits, alongside some pretty smug illiterates. Ahhh. That felt good! I think that it was Norman Maillor (sp?) who said that the very worst writers in the world work for the local newspapers. I have seen that first-hand. I would also add that  the same can be said for the quality of writing for local television. Of course, one must give consideration to the pay rates that are available for such jobs. If a company wants writers who have a command of the English language and a penchant for manipulating grammar in such a manner as to portray the news of local events in an interesting and insightful way, but will only pay slave wages, it's like putting out garbage on your doorstep, in the hope of attracting a champion show dog. It's just not going to happen! I don't suppose that it's the fault of the writers that their drivel finds its way to television sets -- it's the fault of the broadcast company that won't pay for real talent. Yes -- I think that's it. I'll simply pity the poor writer and damn the slave driver who draws his blood to ink the pages that make for better catbox lining than for reading material. Damn, that felt good!

Okay, on to the pictures we go.

      I am nearly over my first ailment of the year -- a sort of respiratory infection that may have something to do with my chronic tonsilitis and the fact that I started a part-time job earlier this month. I fell ill within a week of taking the job, so I think that there must be a connection there. What's sad about it all is that now my gf is coming down with something akin to the sickness that befell me. So, as I write this, I have some tea steeping for her, in the hope that we can circumvent the worst of it. The recent weather has been a bit of a shock to our systems, as well. It's been surprisingly damp and cool for the last few days, after being somewhat excessively hot and humid early on in the month. This week I would like to find another part-time job -- one that might take the place of the one that I currently have. The current hours are somewhat taxing, and the pay is unbelievably low. I realize that the economy stinks like never before in my lifetime, and that I am lucky to have landed the one little job that I've found to help me through the slow part of the year, but I'd be short-changing myself if I didn't continue the search. A last-minute video project from out-of-state promises to come through with some much-needed supplemental pay, making me ponder whether or not to get more involved in a search for such jobs, or to keep up the pursuit of more two-dimensional art jobs, such as the photography, graphic design, and most recently, digital painting/illustration that are closer to my heart. It's a tough call. Digital studio work has a lot going for it, but the video is such a challenge. That is not to say that I cannot find a challenge, otherwise. I just feel like I should or could do more field work now, while I am still young enough to handle it, and save the sedentary work for the next decade of my life.

      Here's a try at a genuine posting -- nah, forget it. I just don't have enough time! I've been fighting with a number of computer issues. In brief, they involve a Mac OS 9.1 - 9.2.2 upgrade so that I could  run the latest version of Painter from corel   (let's see if that reads as a link). As always, the Suitcase font mangler from Extensis aggravates everything, so I am running without it, for the time being. That, and a few other trials awaited me, following the upgrade, but I am pleased to say that the G4 is running smoothly, for now. Or, so it seems, or so I would like for it to seem, so that I can breathe easily enough to spend a few moments writing something other than computer code! Time's up -- gotta design something now...

      I have decided to give the Blogger.com product a try. It seems like it will help me post updates from wherever I am, since my desk is not always the most convenient place to recall things. Lately, especially, I have been compelled to do actual work while at my desk. I'll explain in another posting. Right now, I want to see how this thing works...

      Wanna read a rant? Well, read on.  As you may or may not know, I live in Waco, Texas. I grew up here as a result of my family's move from Dallas so that my father could pursue his career goals through technical training. Although I have spent time away from Waco, I manage to wind up back here before long. Waco has much going for it. It also has some factors at work that serve a dual purpose: to promote Waco's growth by sucking out its life blood. During this fit, I'll briefly describe a few of the actions of Waco's largest employer: Baylor University. As Waco's largest employer, Baylor's governing body attempts to do what it can to enhance life in Waco for those who are willing to commit to Baylor's strict doctrines that include mandatory church attendance for faculty members. Iam not certain if he has abandoned his goal of requiring all faculty to be members of the unique Baylor Baptist Denomination, but for a while at least, that was a goal of Baylor's Chancellor. While Baylor University's presence in Waco may have been a mostly positive influence during Waco's infancy,in recent years BU's role in the life of Waco has grown to more closely resemble that of a parasite, like a tapeworm. You know how a tapeworm propsers: it channels the food that its host consumes to fortify itself,allowing just enough sustinence to pass on to the host's digestive system so that the host survives to give the tapeworm a cozy place to dwell. In most cases, BU's caustic influence results in a tolerable amount of discomfort for residents of Waco. Many here do not realize that the popular outlet mall that is located in Hillsboro, about thirty miles north of Waco on Interstate-35 wanted to locate in Waco. Who nixed that plan? Baylor. Why? Who knows? Having BU call so many shots for Waco is like a thirty year-old man having his octagenarian grandmother decide what's best for him. Now, I am not trying to slight grannies out there. Most are very sweet, but I would not want grandma deciding when and where I could spend my leisure time, or which movies I could watch, would you? If you don't think that it would be so bad, try watching a Lawrence Welk Show marathon sometime. The local PBS station, whose broadcast license is owned by BU, has just such a marathon at least once a year. I used to work for the local PBS affiliate. Back then, it was mostly a production facility for our mother station, KNCT-46. When the powers-that-were decided to shut down dear old KCTF-34 (now KWBU), our staff took immediate action to discover how to keep from "going dark". Necessity is the mother of strange bedfellows, and the only entity that our people could find with the will and the wherewithal to purchase the broadcast license (with a sticker price of about $100,000.00, plus a few fees sprinkled in for good measure) was BU. Initially, my fears were not confirmed by anything that BU did with a PBS station under its control. Now, you will say that KWBU's mission and operation are dictated by the [independent] governing board, but let's be real about it. KWBU is housed in the bowels of BU, and if you think for a moment that anything happens at KWBU without prior approval from BU, then you are a fool. When I worked for KCTF, our small, ill-equipped but highly motivated crew produced numerous community-oriented programs. We shot with busted cameras and VTRs that made more noise than they were designed to record. We shot programs in a studio that was smaller than most people's garages -- all in the name of fulfilling our mission to service the community that provided our membership base. One would think that with BU's support, we would see a proliferation of community-oriented programming from KWBU. Not so. KWBU's production staff are busy at work, alright. They produce material for BU's own internal consumption. This must change, and the PBS affiliate must be unfettered and allowed to service the PUBLIC. BU is a PRIVATE school. Who can't see what's wrong with a private institution having control over a public broadcasting facility? Let's imagine putting something that is normally public and putting it in the hands of a private interest.  It is very likely that you operate a motor vehicle on public thoroughfares, like the roads and highways that get you to work and to the grocery. Let's say that tomorrow the public roads will become the property of a large, private interest. What if that private interest were you? If you owned the public roads, wouldn't you want to use them to service your own desires? You could do with them as you pleased. Feeling a little cash-strapped? Make a few more of the roads into toll roads. Heck, why not make them all toll roads? You could close the roads that went to places that didn't interest you. The road to the public library could be permanently under construction, and traffic detoured to the shopping center. To close this fit, Baylor has a tremendous responsibility. That responsibilty is no longer simply dictated by its Board of Regents. Now that they control a PBS station, they should be held accountable to the public in public television.

      I'm not certain from where the motivation for this trip down memory lane stems, but it's been a boon to my posting, so here goes another fit:  Perhaps the Cox News Service and the Waco Trib recollection spurred this fit. I am reminded of my first job interview with the Waco Tribune Herald. I was about nineteen years old, and interviewing with the editorial office manager, a woman named Barbara something. If the Wicked Witch of the West had an identical twin, Barbara was a shoe-in for her. I was interviewing for an entry-level position with the newspaper. Allow me to attempt to convey the emotion that I was feeling at having landed a job interview with a newspaper. I was years (one or two) away from disillusionment with the whole truth-in-editorial-news-reporting deal, and was under the mistaken impression that a newspaper was some sort of hallowed ground of the written Word -- that I was sitting in one of the last bastions of grammatical sanctity. Boy, was I in for a shock! After my interview, during which I stopped just short of kissing the threshold to the newspaper, Barbara paused for a moment to tell me that I was "too honest" in my interview. I would soon learn, through the newspaper, how volatile and expendable honesty and truth are, and how either one can get in the way of what would otherwise be award-winning journalism. Of course, one might be led to wonder of what value news reporting is when it is told without truth or honesty. I didn't get the job. Barbara's letter arrived and my heart sank. Would I ever be worthy of employment by a Literary Institution like the Waco Tribune Herald? In retrospect, it is nothing short of laughable to think that I -- that anyone could aspire to work with the denizens of the inkwell that flows from Satan's own veins. A couple of years later, I landed a job in the Trib's advertising department. Because I shot with Nikon cameras, and was therefore compatible with the editorial photogs' lenses, I was allowed by the chief photog to shoot for the editorial department from time to time. For what I think may have been my very first editorial assignment for the Trib, I was sent to Oakwood Park to photograph the police officer who was hailed as Waco's "Cop of the Year" for the work that he had done to "clean up" the vicinity of Oakwood Park, which was formerly a hotbed of illicit activity by local at-risk youth. With my first editorial assignment staring me in the face, I wasn't about to take any chances. I loaded up on film stock of all types, carried all five of my Nikon bodies and all of my lenses. I may have even bummed one from the editorial department. The day was overcast. As I exited my car, I began to ponder the lighting situation. The reporter for the story, Mark England met me in the small parking lot adjacent to the park. It was late Autumn, and it was beginning to drizzle. I had to work fast. England pointed me toward a park bench where Sgt. Gary Green was standing with a group of young African-Americans, mostly guys. They appeared to be carrying on with a congenial aire. Mark looked me over and saw that I was all camera gear. "You're loaded for bear," he remarked. I told him that I was not about to blow this opportunity to shoot some local "art". "Art" is what newspaper editors call photos that illustrate their stories. As I approached the police sargeant, I drew the attention of one of the young black men who was hanging out with the cop. He was about 6'8" and about 280 lbs. The young man was so large that I think that his vocal cords were smothered by his sheer girth. He asked me something that I found to be unintelligible. Even when he repeated it, I still could not make out what he was asking of me. It sounded a bit like, "Areyafit'nfilm?" I turned to Mark, who offered up a translation. "Oh, uh, yes. I am here to take a picture of the sargeant over there," I said. The young, huge man's eyes widened, as if he had seen a ghost. He turned to his cohorts, who numbered just shy of a dozen, motioned to them and within seconds, they had scattered to the furthest corners of the park -- maybe even out of the county. Mark observed, "Wow, you sure can clear a room." The group had obviously scrambled away after getting the signal from my unintelligible friend to get out of camera shot. I thought little of it, being pressed for time, as the drizzle was rapidly becoming full-fledged rain. I made my photos, and the next day eagerly snatched up the first issue of the paper that I could find. Prominently plastered on the front page of the local section was my photo of a pensive police officer, sitting on his own at a concrete park bench in a park that was devoid of any other souls. I was pleased. But only until I read the lead-in for the Mark England story, which read something like, "The black youths that were gathered Oakwood Park scattered as Waco Police Sargeant Gary Green approached."  He was there, and saw exactly what I saw. Why was it so important to manipulate the facts in this little local story? How often, do you suppose, was he led to do the same thing, thinking that it would pull in a reader? That being said, Mark England is an award-winning journalist for the Cox News Service. The awards are generally for deadline reporting, but I think that he should receive a second accolade for his creative and inspired work(s) of fiction.

      This month's Waco Today, a sort of periodical supplement to the local Cox News Service-affiliated Waco Tribune-Herald contains a story about local businessman Randy Robert's fashionable Hummer H2. It's funny to me that the story refers to Mr. Roberts as a "former owner of Waco's RiverSquare Center", a fairly posh property for Waco, but somehow journalist Alan Hunt, who penned the story managed to leave out the fact that a significant amount of the cashflow that facilitated the development of that property coursed through the Showtime Club, a topless bar located in a fairly unfashionable area of Waco. To quote Randy's vanity license plate, "DUHH."

      Today, I was told, after a fashion that the way that I speak puts others on the defensive, and furthermore that my mode of discourse comes off as being adversarial. To that, I have to say that, if anyone is put off by the way that I speak, that he should not hesitate to go take a long run down a very short pier. I mean, really -- when have you ever been called in for a meeting with your manager to hear such a load? Listen, I am not a wealthy man. I have little in the way of material goods, but I am thankful and proud to have developed a relationship with the English language that affords me such a -- a compliment. That's what it is, after all. This reminds me of a time that I was referred to as a "temperamental artist." First off, I find the phrase to be redundant. Since when has a true artist been anything   but   temperamental? And, what artist could hope to find his passion, and tap into it without colliding with his own temperamentality? Puh-leeze. It's not my fault that I must deal with people who are, at best functional illiterates.  Note to self: today I was accused of sleeping on the job -- really -- SLEEPING. The accuser could not say WHEN this allegedly happened, so the point is less than moot. Furthermore, I was accused of mouthing off to a member of another department, when asked what I was doing in a particular location in the facility (something which did NOT happen). I might suggest that one of the individuals bringing these charges does, herself doze off at her desk from time to time. And so do others! I could go on, but I will curtail this tirade so that I can return to the pressing business of business. I also have some pressing to do.  Note this well: the world has but a single problem: people. I wish with all of my heart that this were not true. Ask yourself: When has the action of any person, or group of people actually done the world a deal of good? Think carefully. Be careful not to jump to the answer that any doctrine born of man has successfully promoted man's love for his fellow man, or that any leader has ever been effective at cleaning up mother Earth. But, please do ponder the question. I'd be interested to hear some answers.

      Time for another short trip down memory lane...  It comes as a bit of a surprise to me that some people are intimidated by me, or rather, by certain things about me. I feel strongly that the cause of the intimidation is my vocabulary. I find this to be almost laughable, because I do not consider either my vocabulary or my treatment of the English language to be anything over which to be troubled. This is where I take a moment to attempt to explain why I have such an affinity for the language. It boils down to a simple thing: spite. Perhaps "spite" is too strong a word, but I am at a loss for a better definition (see?). When my parents were children, they were the subject of racial discrimination. Technically, it should probably be called "ethnic" discrimination, but most people call it racial and would be confused to hear it called what it might really be. My parents were Spanish-speaking U.S. citizens, living in central Texas. When they went to school and were caught speaking Spanish, they were punished, or at least reprimanded by the school teachers. As if that were not enough, when they were a little older and began to ride on public transit, they were ushered to the back of the bus, along with the African Americans, who were also being robbed of their civil rights. I can't say exactly when it happened, but at some point during the course of events that served to bruise the pride of a particularly proud young Hispanic man, he decided that, when he had children that they would learn to speak the language of the people who had berated him and his wife. And so, when I was able to speak and read, it was English that I consumed, and I grew to a degree of mastery of such that it was not long before I was helping those for whom English was the language of their family to better use it. I speak English very well, I must concede, but at the cost of losing touch with the language of my parents. When I hear people speaking Spanish now, I feel as if I am hearing distant echoes of my parents' voices, and those of their parents -- only I cannot make out the meanings of their words to save my life.

      I am waiting for a job to print just now, so, unless it is horribly in need of babysitting, I am going to take this time to allow for a stroll down memory lane. Here goes...  For the last few years, I have been trying to get into the film industy in Texas. This is a bit of a challenge, since I live a hundred miles from the hub of the Texas film industry: Austin, but I felt that I could make the distance work in my favor. After all, if I am a hundred miles away, then I must be that much close than someone in say, Dallas or Lubbock, right? Additionally, I have some family, friends and contacts in the area that might help me out by providing me with temporary lodging during a film stint, should I happen to land one. After months of slogging along, emailing, faxing and phoning, I received a call from an indie film company in Austin that was about to shoot a period western on HD. The catch was that payment would be deferred until the project was sold. It sounded a bit sketchy, but I was determined to do some work on film, indie or otherwise, film or videotape. I agreed to meet with some of the production staff later that month. When I arrived, I was a bit shocked to discover that I was the oldest person there (I was thirty-one at the time, I think). Nevertheless, I listened to what the director (an actor named Jesse Petrick) had to say, and when it came time to tout my expertise, I told him that I would be of greatest use to him as a member of the camera crew. Nevermind that I had no experience with motion picture production or even with HD -- I have an affinity and a great aptitude for cameras, no matter the species. Jesse told me that he already had a camera crew lined up for the project, but that he would try to get me on the gaffer's crew. I accepted the post, hoping that I would find an opportunity to shine. When the first day of production arrived (or, rather MY first day, as I was laid up for a couple of days with a nasty case of poison ivy), I was called out by the cinematographer (Paul Wojack - sp?) because their camera crew had apparently turned up missing. He interviewed me briefly in order to determine whether it was wise to have me share the responsibility for the $200,000.00 camera that they were about to pick up. We seemed to be well-attuned to each other, and he agreed to have me as his First Camera Assistant, asking also that I bring my light meters to the set each day. I was in! I rejoiced this fact to no end as we awaited the arrival of the camera gear on the set -- Willie Nelson's ranch outside of Bee Caves, Texas. And so, for the next three weeks, I was part of an indie film crew shooting a period western somewhere in Texas. There are a few more chapters to write in there, but I'll return to that line of the story later on. With some "real" experience under my belt, I felt that I would have no trouble -- or at least, less trouble finding work in film production. After updating my resume accordingly, I set out to strike for work on "The Life of David Gale" and "The Alamo", as well as a plethora of other indie projects. No calls. Nothing at all. Not even a hit on my online resume page. I couldn't be sure that my letters and faxes arrived at the production offices, because those guys are way too busy to acknowledge anything short of an offer to bankroll the project. One day, while bemoaning the fact that I was having no luck breaking in to the film biz, my gf's sister suggested that I try out as an extra for one of the films that never called me. As luck would have it, in another week or two, there was a casting call for extras on the Alamo film in downtown Austin. I made the cut, and spent three days in December in a cow pasture during a heavy rain learning how to march and fire a musket like a Mexican soldier at $15 per day! Here is where something interesting happens. On the first day of training, I found myself praying. I was praying for guidance -- probably the most important thing that I can think of. Actually, I wasn't praying for guidance, I was praying for Guidance, and some sort of indication of whether or not I should be pursuing this project. My friend, Rusty, felt that this was going to be my big break. So, I wanted to chase down that hope, or dream. I'm on the road, like I said, the first morning of training. I have a map and instructions to not be late. I've given myself plenty of time to get there. The training ground is on a privately owned ranch near Wimberley, and I don't want to lose my bearings. There was heavy rain the night before, and it is still drizzling. Feeling a little out-of-my-element, I commence to praying that Guidance prayer. That's when the left rear tire on my car goes flat. I frantically change it, putting the temporary spare on and getting back on course. This time, I am praying for help in getting to the location. In my haste, I ignored the fact that the Guidance that I was requesting was delivered. Once the day's training was over, and I, along with everyone else who showed up was soaked and covered with a mixture of mud and manure, I got into my car to make my way to the hotel in San Marcos where I was staying. Along the way, I continued, with Guidance Prayer part II. That's about the time that the temporary spare went flat.

      More about my part-time job -- I've just about had it, this time, so I am not keeping my employer's identity a secret, any longer. Perhaps my rants about them will help others avoid seeking out a job with them. I work for KXXV Channel 25. I am upset because, tonight, one of the Directors, who is fond of yelling at people through the intercom headsets, did so at a particularly high volume -- perhaps enough to cause hearing loss in those others who happened to be plugged into it as part of their job requirement. I am inclined to lodge a complaint with the production supervisor, but for now I will simply document the event for future reference. If I end up needing a hearing aid, I want to remember who's responsible for deafening me.

I haven't written much, lately because I have a tremendous amount of work to do for a steadily growing number of people, so my blogging time has been scaled back, accordingly. I've recently discovered how to make it cloudy: buy a solar battery charger and try to use it! It's almost as good as washing the car to make it rain. Try it.

      For the last month, more or less, I have been tormented by some pretty odd and surprisingly vivid dreams. Some have been fairly immersive, giving me the power to explore the dreamworld at me leisure, while some have appeared as faint projections against the inside of my eyelids. Because of my odd schedule, I often power nap. Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's bizarre sleep habits, I am finding that short sleep periods are doing a lot to shake up my consciousness. Whether for good or bad, it has a tendency to make the line between dreams and reality somewhat tenuous. Here's today's product:

I was running from something, and arrived at my office building, gasping for air. Everything seemed normal, but once I was inside, the place became a sort of house of mirrors, and I could not find my way to my desk. This might have something to do with the fact that I've had trouble concentrating on work for the last month. I noticed that the soft drink vending machine was in a different location, and that it was no longer a Dr Pepper machine, but a Coca Cola machine. Initially, I thought that I had entered the wrong building. THEN, I saw my friend, Mark the weatherman. He seemed to be talking to people that I couldn't see -- much like he talks to a television audience in the TV studio. Well, I pulled him aside, and told him that this was my dream and that I wanted for him to help me to get out of it. At that moment, his expression went from animated to complete blankness. I grabbed him by the shoulders, shoved him against the door, and repeated myself. Still blank. I looked into his eyes, and he seemed transfixed by something -- sort of the "thousand yard stare", as if seeing something from beyond. For a moment, I thought to myself, "well, I know this to be a dream, so it's not going to hurt anything if I smash down the door with him, but I stodd fast, wondering what else I could do to wake up. I am not sure what those last bits meant, but the agitation must have increased my heart rate enough to wake me up. It was probably an entire hour before I felt fully seated in reality again. Friends tell me that when they suffered a breakup, that their dreams have been the only shelter from the pain. Well, it appears to be a little backwards with me. My waking hours tend to be peaceful, while my dreams are riddled with struggles.

      I've just about gotten over a somewhat surprising breakup that I suffered recently. I just can't believe that I fell into a relationship with what can only be described as a pagan mystic! Her excuse for her bad behaviour: sexual abuse early on in life. Why I didn't run when I learned of her tremendous baggage, I do not know. Wait, I DO know. Back when I elected to leave the US Navy, my CO called me a quitter. I can hear him now, "From this moment on, you will always be a quitter." I suppose that I am trying to live down those words by refusing to quit on certain things. Don't misunderstand -- I quit things all the time, but this relationship was something that I was not willing to give up on. Unfortunately, because of the severe degree to which the ex suffered from consequences such as PTSD, she was never really at liberty to give 100% to the relationship. Oh, well. Friends tell me that I was lucky that it only dragged on for a year of my life. Now I can get back to work, they tell me. They are correct, of course. Still, I have to admit that it hurt a great deal, and that I am likely to give up on finding the One altogether. Acutally, I found the One years ago, and I let her go. For years I believed that I had let True Love slip through my fingers. This one made me feel otherwise, but only because I was deceiving myself. So, facing these facts, I am now resigned to other pursuits. Which ones? Fewer ones, for starts. It is becoming clear to me that my Path is not to be found on any map. I feel as if I am either going to have to find the path by touch, or by hacking one out of the clutter that I have amassed of life. I am not exactly depressed about my lot, I am just trying to distill the essentials so that I can get moving. I still feel sad about being alone -- I love women so... Y'know, the most accurate appraisal of life can be found in the words of a Billy Joel song, "Honesty." Seriously.

The weather is turning mild. I think that I'll go outside and sit for a while...

      It's the little things that bear recording, isn't it? Or, aren't they? Tell you what, I am going to put some grammar rules on the back burner for a bit so that I can spill some information.

In case you haven't read the rest of the blog, I live in Waco, Texas. I have been fortunate to be regarded as a member or component of the local art community, if Waco can be said to have one. This is a town of just over 100,000 people, most of whom labor either in the industrial district or for the lumbering Baptist juggernaut, Baylor University. The other day, a fairly illuminated (by that I do not mean that he was "lit") friend asked me why the arts do not flourish here. There are smaller towns around here where the arts are alive and well, but here the arts seem to struggle and even when they do manage to get by, there is so much conflict within that "scene", that we may as well not even have one. I told my friend that Waco's population breaks down into roughly three groups. Those industial laborers whose idea of art is a tractor pull, the Baylor slaves who dare not engage in any free thought, lest they lose hope of tenure (or they are already in an underground cult that takes up all of their spare time), and the rest, who are a mish-mash of religious zealots, home-schoolers (or both), and a handful  enlightened minds, who also stand a good chance of being horribly misguided in their lives, and so have no time to engage in or think about the arts. If we do a little math on this, we can estimate that there might be about five thousand residents of Waco/McLennan county who might participate in and support the arts. That's not nearly enough. If you want to keep a gun show alive, or a truck rally, then you've got it made. Otherwise, forget it.

There's nothing like a rant to put a smile back on my face! Sorry, Waco, but it's the truth. I was also told that I represented a "pocket of culture" here. I'll never forget that compliment, or the man who said that to me. It's not that I detest everyone here -- it's just the sophomoric mentality that takes over in so many instances that puts me off. The Good-Ol' Boy clubs, and the like. I am fond of saying that my mantra is, "No associations, no affiliations and no allegiances." Try it. You'll be on your own, but when the only person that you can trust is yourself, what does it matter?

      Okay, here I go, messing  up the entire chronology, again. Back in March, I had the pleasure  of attending a lecture at the University of Texas at Arlington  by  urlLink Jerry Uelsmann . It was a real treat to hear him speak, in person. I've seen videotaped interviews and read  his writings, but nothing compares to playing audience to a creative genius like Uelsmann in an open and unedited forum. Many thanks  to Betye Holy for informing me of the lecture. I hope that I spelled your name correctly.

      More about life on the "Surviving Nugent" set --

Having never worked on the set of a reallity-television show, I have no peer to which I can compare the experience of working on "Nugent". It was fairly similar to other forms of TV production, I suppose. There were the network execs, producers, PAs and such, in addition to the camera crews and their attendant technicians.

Bear in mind that reality television has been a godsend to network programmers, who can now take the money that they once had to spend on screenwriters and actors to spend on smart new haircuts. Of course, even with the snappy coifs, network execs still want more from their cut-rate programming. And so, they continue to want for more, say in the way of subscriptions to the New Yorker and the freshest of sushi. This leads them to offer the production assistants the very lowest of pay in the industry. I can recall working a gig for Court-TV in Austin, Texas for which I was offered $250/day for a ten-hour day, with $35 per diem. The job was offered to me here in Waco because the production supervisor was unable to find anyone to work for so little in the Austin area. While I would have been delighted to work for that rate for the VH1 folks, the pay was a flat $100/day, so I was not quite so thrilled to take the punishment that all PAs are required to suffer. I would strongly suggest that any PAs reading this stick to their guns and hold out for a higher rate, for future productions that land in the area. The worst thing that will happen is that the production company will have to deal with totally incompetent PAs, instead of us moderately incompetent ones...

      I was reluctant to report on the events of the last couple of weeks, just in case such a report would hamper the production. Now that it is done, I can make some statements about what I was up to during that time.

I managed to land a job working on VH1's reality-TV show entitled, "Surviving Nugent". If you caught the original airing of the 2-hour special on 5 Oct 2003, or the repeat on 18 Jan 2004, you saw how the producers have combined aspects of "The Osbornes", "Survivor", and perhaps "Big Brother" to make a wild and perverse show involving contestants, a rock star, and a lot of juvenille pranks and prizes.

A number of the mind games that "Nugent" played (none of this was Nugent's plan, of course -- it was all the dream of the producers) were also played on the crew. For instance, on Day 1 of production, one of the contestants (who is actually a stuntman) fakes an injury that is meant to drive home the "reality" of the show to the other contestants. The frantic call goes out over the radio for a medic. The EMTs who are on standby at the set rush into action, and make a call for a helicopter to expedite transport of the injured "contestant" to the nearest hospital. For the next few minutes, the producers act like it's the end of the show, their careers, and reality television. It is not until the 1st AD goes to the front gate to stop the ambulance that we begin to wonder whether this is just a gag, which, of course it was. Needless to say, the EMTs were beside themselves with anger over having been used in this "Cry Wolf" stunt.

News reports have also been made about the real injury that Ted Nugent suffered on that same day. While illustrating the "chores" that the contestants would be expected to perform while on the ranch, "Uncle Ted" grew fatigued and let a chainsaw slip, cutting into his left knee. He was hobbled for a couple of days, but was able to continue with the show.

Into every show, a few mishaps must fall. On the prep day, the truck that was meant to deliver a modular office building to the ranch site demolished the Nuge's front security gate, at a cost of about $10,000.00. A couple of rain-soaked days wreaked havoc on some delicate electronic gear. The rains also made travel across the unpaved pastures treacherous, leading to the formation of a number of mud baths.

      I managed to make it through the Autumn without falling deathly ill. It's the first Autumn in years that I have been able to dodge an ailment of some sort. That all changed last week. I was bound to get something, as everyone in the office is coughing and sneezing. So, I have a touch of something. It's not anything horrendous -- just damned annoying. The odd weather patterns haven't helped, either.

I have landed an outdoor job for the next couple of weeks. I hope that the fresh air and sunshine enables me to grow strong enough to deal with the cold air to which I will be exposed.

Am just a little listless at the moment. I haven't had very many days off during the holidaze. I managed to work just about every day, save maybe one.

I registered my car today. I always forget to do that on-time. When I spent most of my time in Waco, the cop who would spot the expired tag would tend to let me off with a warning, serving as a good reminder to take care of it. Now that I work in Hewitt, just outside of Waco, I always get a ticket, costing $95 for the oversight. I know that I deserve the ticket, but it just shows how much more likely it is that a real, er Waco cop will be lenient than will a crappy, lousy, rotten, stinking, pimply Hewitt pig. That's all.

      Here's a New Year's Resolution that I'm thinking about: try not to be so damned heavy with the topics. Okay, I had a really lousy part-time job last year, and my PTSD-suffering girlfriend hit rock-bottom and left me. The rotten job taught me to stay away from small-market television jobs, and the ex taught me that the last thing that I need in my life is a troubled woman. Two powerful lessons that took their toll, but I'm now rejuvenated and feel fantastic about everything. Now, if only I could find my blog archive files...

      What have I been up to, you ask? Even if you are not asking, here is a brief account of what I think has been going on in my life:
Since mid-October I have been at work on a product catalog for a small company. The product line has been expanded since last year, so there were a good deal more items to photograph. At the same time, I have been juggling some other small ad jobs. I slipped on a couple, but that's what happens. So, I fail from time to time. I like the Michael Jordan television spot in which he lists the number of times that he has failed. It's encouraging for someone like me, who fears failure so much.

I've been catching up on two things: exercise and alcohol consumption. I exercise on my own, then visit a bar or two with some friends. It's okay, apart from coming home smelling of the bar. I've read a couple of books, watched a lot of movies, and thought about what I am going to try to accomplish this year.

I visited a friend who was dining with some of her hoity-toity female friends the other night. When I left the table to use the restroom, one of the asked my friend, "He's a little wierd, isn't he?" I was pretty amused by that inquiry. You see, all of my life I have been considered at least a little odd. Then, last year I landed a gig shooting a little documentary for a non-profit organization. They flew me out to a Navajo reservation in Arizona to record a symposium of sorts. While lunching with the producer, I was taken aback just a little when he looked me over and remarked, "You're not wierd enough to be a shooter." Shooter is tv-talk for a camera operator. I was speechless. What to do? Perhaps I do too much work containing my peculiarities. In my heart, I know that I am strange as hell, but how do I convince the right people of it? I don't care that the flakes find me odd. Anyhow, it's laughable, to say the least.

Next week, I hope to get on the set of a TV show that is shooting nearby. I can't reveal anything about it, but it should be a total blast. It will be nice to vacation from my desk for a few weeks, before the horrendous Texas heat blasts in.

      So, I received the printed version of the Texas Fillm Commission's 2004 Production Manual, only to discover that my phone number is misprinted in it. It seems that I submitted the correct number, but that the data entry person mis-keyed it. I missed it on the proof, too. Just my luck! They are correcting the online database, which should be sufficient, as most people refer to it first, anyway.

It's a rainy day in Waco. My collegue is driving to Mexico today to do some shopping, while I get stood up on photo sessions. Typical. So, I am trying to make some headway with the studio installations, but the help keeps on disappearing! And SO, I am watching DVDs while trying to imagine what other artists are doing at this moment.

      I've made some new equipment purchases over the last couple of months, and wanted to log some gripes over my dealings with the dopes at PC/MACMALL. For starters, the salesman would offer me discounts to make the sale, but would conveniently forget about them, and so I would get charged full price on the invoice. He would never, ever return my calls, either. In the RAM department, I was sold Viking PC2700, which proved to be inadequate. Since MACMALL would not return my calls, I contacted Viking and was told that they had PC3200 RAM specified for the Apple Dual 1.9GHz PowerMac G5 that I owned. Viking replaced the RAM with the PC3200 set and all appears sound.

PCNation sold me an NEC-Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2070 SB with a big smudge in the phosphor, so it had to go back. The refurb arrived without my SpectraView calibrator. They had negleted to tell me to send only the monitor, no cables or accessories, and so I received only a monitor.

Several weeks after my upgrade to the G5, I now appear to have a complete set of tools, even though the SpectraView software is not compatible with OS X Panther...

      Early in the winter, I purchased an NEC-Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2070SB (22"CRT) with SpectraView gadget. The monitor was defective from day one, but I was reluctant to return it immediately (big mistake). When I finally did return it for a warranty replacement (refurb), I was sent an item that was missing all of the fancy SpectraView attachments. In short, I want to caution anyone against buying from NEC-Mitsubishi, because of the series of blunders that has resulted in a lot of down time for my office. It is said that a satisfied customer tells one other person of his experience with a vendor, and that a dissatisfied one tells ten others. Well, I hope to reach a broader scope though this posting... The NEC item appeared to have the features of the Sony Artisan product that I had considered, at a lower price, but the defects in the merchandise and in the replacement service has left me wishing that I had purchased something else. I am going to go and scrape the word mark and logos from the bezel of the monitor now...

      This week, my little, tenacious car died. The timing chain broke while I was driving to the mechanic to investigate the rattling noise in the engine. So, as I understand it, the valves slammed into the pistons, essentially turning my engine into scrap metal. Things could be worse, of course. They could always be worse...

The move into the new studio is nearly complete, and now there may be a place for me in it. The new studio is close to my home than the old office, so if I have to ride my bike to work, I'll be less winded by the trip. Of course, motorists here in Waco are unaccustomed to bicycle traffic, and so biking to work might be my demise. I'll shop for an affordable used car to get me through the year, and by next year be in a position to buy a newer and better one. I just detest automobile salesmen so much! They are the primary reason that I resist the urge to buy new vehicles.

      January was meant to be the month that a colleague and I moved her studio into a new location. The old location was musty with dismal memories, not to mention the rat problems, and so it was time to leave. The new place is slightly larger, and has a better layout, to boot. There may even be room enough to accommodate my small family of Apple computers -- we'll just have to see how and where everything lands. The new place would be ready by now, if it weren't for some bruised prides and touchy dispositions on the part of all involved. Throw into the mix the inevitable accident and you have what we are faced with: about three weeks of delays and setbacks. At any rate, we are determined to move forward. Perhaps the studio will be ready to present to clientele before the end of THIS month...

This week, we had a child or two in for some Easter pics. Not wanting to drug a bunny rabbit, Mary chose to bring in an assortment of baby chicks and ducklings. Which, do you suppose, would be more difficult to manage: the chicks & ducklings, or one doped-up bunny? I'll leave to your imagination the challanges that we encountered.

      There were just a couple of things worth noting this month. Local video production continues to disappoint me. An old collegue still cannot manage to pay me in a timely fashion. I won't mention any names, this time around. I will simply caution anyone looking for work as a camera operator/videographer in this neck of the woods to secure partial payment in advance of working for some of the local "professional" video production services.

I managed to repair the clothes dryer, after a little confusion and confrontation over the phone with some customer service reps. Being a Do-It-Myselfer, I prefer to work on things around the house on my own. Besides, how much more manly can I look than when I am decked-out in my grundgies, covered with appliance residue, operating tools and grunting? First, I thought that the problem was with the heater element. Wrong. Then, we ordered the $10 repair manual, after being told that a tech rep could "talk me through" a portion of the installation process. Wrong. Repair manual in hand, I then diagnosed the real issue: one (or more) bad fuses/thermal cutoffs. Such things are sold in sets, or maybe not. I ended up with an extra one, since the rep didn't know that one order number included both items, and the second order number represented only one. Confusion, yes, but the fuses worked, and the new heater element on the 13-yr old dryer means that the clothes get dry much faster than before. Total outlay: about $110.00. It might have cost more than $200 to get the repair guy on the scene. For the most part, the Sears people were helpful. No question that they were courteous -- just a little ill-informed on the thousands of components that they have to manage and deliver.

Something is up with my new PowerMac G5 and its DVD burning ability. I've never had more trouble with failed verifications that I have with this monster. My old G4 and external  urlLink EZQuest  DVD-R drive have outperformed the G5 and its internal SuperDrive consistently. I imagine that it has something to do with the software/OS on the G5.

For about a week this month, I was receiving spam text messages on my cell phone. I complained to the wireless service provider a few times, and was quite surprised when they stopped popping up. I am hesitant to credit the service provider, so I won't.

      We went to Dallas to test drive  urlLink Mini Coopers  this weekend. They're rather nifty little cars. I just wish that they got better fuel economy. I really wanted to test drive a  urlLink Toyota Prius , but demand for them is so incredibly high, that it may be months before I get the opportunity.  After the test drive, we headed to  urlLink Hugo, Oklahoma  with Eliska's mother to visit with E's grandmother there. She fed us some fantastic homemade cheesecake during our visit.  Then, it was over to Ft.Worth for a  urlLink Huey Lewis & The News  concert at  urlLink Billy Bob's Texas , courtesy of Eliska's cousin. In the parking lot, we saw a  urlLink DeLorean , like the one that I had in high school. (sigh)  The weekend done, we headed right back, because Eliska had to report to work for a Sunday a.m. vice-presidential arrival, or departure, or something presidential. I was too sleepy to recall what the hubbub was about. My dad had a photo taken with the bozo, whichever one of them it was.  Now I am trying to find a female vocalist to sing a  urlLink Sara Groves   song at our wedding...

      I took time off from mundane studio work to watch Houston run, roll, and run relays with a rubber chicken and fish this morning...  I forgot to deliver a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to a woman at the church, again! I was in the neighborhood, too... These days, gas is too expensive to not hit as many needed stops in one go. Hmph.  In other news, we're off to a Huey Lewis concert tomorrow. I can't say that I was ever a huge fan of the band, but I hear that the show is good and the tickets were provided by my finacé's cousin. I always say that nothing tastes better than a free meal... I should revise that saying, because last night's meal at  urlLink Ridgewood Country Club  for Eliska's graduation from  urlLink Leadership Waco   left much to be desired. I think that the chicken died of natural causes. Of course, the meal might have been perfectly fine. It may have been the company that spoiled it, with few exceptions, of course (being Eliska, Elton, Charles, K.Paul, and a few others). I've been to a Leadership Waco graduation before. This one was much less pleasant than the first one that I attended. The class speaker was far less entertaining that the last one. He just seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice way too much. Since it was the 20th class, it was also a sort of class reunion of all of the other ones. It was remarkable to note how many of the old class members are still in Waco. In that respect, being elected to attend Leadership Waco may amount to little more than a life sentence in Waco. Before I go any farther with my negative review of the evening, I must point out that the highlight of the whole affair, and the only glimmer of light in the room was from my lovely fiancé. I'd almost endure another one of those for her. I just pray that I won't have to for some time...

       urlLink Check out our new pet feeder.   We've been astonished at how rapidly the birds deplete the dogs' food from their dispensers. After some difficulty with programming the timer, I think that we now have it set to where it will feed the dogs five times each day. If you happen to purchase one of these devices, be sure to RESET the timer before attempting to program it. It wouldn't dispense food before I hit that reset button, and the dogs went hungry for the first day...

      Yes, that's the working title of the indie film that is set to shoot in  the Waco area this October for sixteen days of principle photography.  Janice tells me that the distributor is very interested, but cannot  recall the distributor's name. It's supposed to be a big one. The  writer/director is Deborah Reece, who will be conducting an open call  for crew and cast at the  urlLink Lexington Inn  on 30 May from 10a-5p. That  meeting will determine whether or not she (or her DP or AD) will want me to work and whether I will want to work on the project. The DP is  probably going to be a guy from Dallas, who has twenty features to his  credit. They might be shooting on HD, with which I have some experience as a 1st AC, so I might stand a chance of getting on camera crew for  the first unit (if there is such a thing as a SECOND unit on this gig).  We'll see. Sixteen days is not that long for a feature. I worked a  grueling thirty days on "Heathens", which was a deferred payment gig, as is this one.

       urlLink CNN.com - Cannes applauds anti-Bush film - May 17, 2004   The article says it all. I wanted to echo the sentiment over the fact that "Americans" are censoring free speech, yet again. An acquaintance of mine who is serving in eastern Europe right now told me how mistaken most Americans are about our liberties. She was quick to tell of how many European nations enjoy many more liberties than Americans do. The recent censorship of Michael Moore's recent project should call attention to that fact.

      My finacé and I have opted for a short engagement, leaving little time for things like showers and such. Since this will be her second and my first marriage, she doesn't need quite as much stuff as I do. So, the  urlLink wedding registry  that we've created on Amazon.com is focused on me and the kids. I've never listed in a reigistry before, and certainly not online. Like I said in a previous post, a donation to our PayPal wedding fund is just as useful as a gift from the registry.

      My fiancé and I met over lunch with the minister who will preside over  our nuptials next month. We have a personality test to take, and a book  to read. When I dropped out of college, I thought that I was done with  testing and assigned reading. If I had known how many more tests and  reading assignments I'd have throughout life, I would have stayed in  school!  But seriously, the man who gave us the work to do knows what he is  talking about. I knew that I wanted him to marry us after hearing just  one of his sermons at church. The sermon was topical and cogent without  being overly "preachy". So practical was his approach as to make  perfect sense to anyone. I won't go into it just now, but I am looking  forward to hearing more of the wisdom that he's distilled from life.

      The strip mall where the studio is located just received a new roof. For some reason, the new roof is leaking like a sieve, and the Chinese buffet down the way has suffered a lot of water damage, due to the recent rains. We've had to replace just a few ceiling tiles, but other neighbors are finding their ceilings coming down on them.  Yesterday, I was standing outside the back door smoking a cigar, when I became aware of a number of itches on my bare forearms and neck. Then, on my scalp. On closer inspection, I found that I was covered in some sort of larvae that were stinging me with their little tails. Hundreds of them! I think that I managed to brush them off and wash them out of my hair, but it's one of the oddest things to happen to me in a while.

      I am a photographer. I make pictures for people. Some  of them are for commercial intentions. I recently created an image that the client is afraid to use, because it "desecrates" a local  "landmark". In short, I digitally removed a sign from an old building  and replaced it with the client's logo. No, the client doesn't reside  in the building, but I saw the treatment as being a clever and  eye-catching use of the scenery. The client has been warned by a local  bozo attorney not to use the image, because it would open her up to a  host of legal action. Well, I am thinking about publishing the image  here, just to let people know what they are missing out on. Hmph.

      After spending the better part of the year posting complaints about one thing and another, I thought that I would mention something that brings a smile to my face and keeps it there. Over the weekend, I became engaged to be married to the woman for whom I have been searching. I knew that she was out there, somewhere. If you'd like to take part in helping with the nuptials, then please use the PayPal donation button that appears on this page.  This will be my first and only marriage, and I am delighted to be in this place, at last. It's been a long search. I am 34, never before married, with no children of my own. She brings everything I could ever desire in a woman. The list is far too long to cover in this blog entry. Suffice it to say that I have never been happier, and could not have imagined being this happy.  Tonight, we reached a decision on the wedding date. It's just six weeks away, so if you're going to donate to the nuptial fund, please do it now.  I must wrap this up, because I have some more complaints that I'd like to get to... :)

      I have to write about this: I am getting married tomorrow, and we'd planned on spending a couple of nights at the Brazos House B&B in Waco in their "big cottage". We made the reservation several weeks ago, in spite of the proprietor's inability to return calls. I called today to check that they still had our reservation, and was rather surprised to hear that the cottage was no longer available, due to a tree fall from heavy rain. The manager simply forgot to call us while he was out of town. Imagine what would have happened if we'd arrived without double checking, first! Good Grief! So, that's my rant on that establishment.

      I am uploading to this site that sells prints of the images that I upload. It might make it easier for me to sell from the dotphoto.com site than it would be to build my own shopping pages. Anyhow, I'm giving it a try.

      I know that I am not alone in this complaint about my wireless phone service provider. I decided to take them up on the offer to add on a second line of wireless service, so that I can communicate with my fiancé using the free mobile-to-mobile feature. Yesterday's attempt to activate that second line of service took about 2.5 hours to accomplish. Everything seemed to be going smoothly, but I detected that things were about to go off course when the operator said that she would need my credit card number to verify me, even though I've been slave to their service for nearly ten years. This came as a surprise even to her. I provided the number and things seemed to get back on track. At this point, I am trying to pay attention to my fiancé's daughter, who is taking her weekly gymnastics lesson. When it comes time to provide the shipping address, there is another hiccup: the AT&T operator cannot get my office address to verify in the FedEx database. There's a Mailboxes, Etc. next door to me, and FedEx delivers to them every day. We have the same street address, but different suite numbers. Not wanting to stall any longer (the operator had a case of laryngitis), she takes down my home address and tell me that she will transfer me to someone who can carry on with the address verification for my office address. She transfers me, and Amy, the woman who is supposed to be able to solve the shipping address problemo begins to talk to me about the issue. Within thirty seconds, the call is dropped and I have to call them back. The next person that I talk to (Carla) says that I cannot change the shipping address, that I will have to cancel the order and start all over again! So, I went to work hounding this one to change the address and/or to put Amy back on. "Amy has stepped out." So, I ask for a supervisor. Bad idea. I get put on hold, or as I like to call it, "time out." After a few minutes, I hang up and call back. It's Carla, again! And I am back on hold! Hang up. Call back and cancel the order. Start from scratch. The next operator tells me that I cannot activate a second line of service until the next day, as the "system is down." I will have to wait another day. I attempt to tell her that I just activated and cancelled service within minutes of this call and want to start over with the ordeal. Hold. Hang up. Call back. Finally, I find someone (Nathan?) who irons things out, waives the shipping charges and restores my confidence, but not for long. The CSR to whom he transfers me in order to upgrade my plan to meet with the demands of the promotion tells me that she cannot detect evidence that I have activated a second line. Nathan tells her that she will have to activate my "sharable plan" before she can see the second line. She does, but she still cannot. So, as I close this entry and get back to work, I anticipate adding another chapter to the epic that is my detestable mLife...

       urlLink Target : Club Wedd   Less than two weeks remain for people to get us stuff on the registries. We are way behind in getting registered for items that we can use in the home, so take a look at what we've selected. There are a host of small items on the Target registry that we'd really like.

      I just returned from lunch with my fiancé. She had some gift certificates to a local barbeque joint in Waco called Michna's. The gift certificates dated back to 2002, but they had no expiration date on them, so we didn't hesitate to present them at the counter. Besides, they'd honored them just a few months ago. The manager could not have looked or behaved more upset if we had told her that her brand of hair bleach was being discontinued. After retreating to the office for ten minutes, she returned to tell us that today was the last day that she would honor the coupons -- which was fine with us, because we won't be going back to be treated as if we were trying to rob the place.

      As some friends have observed, I haven't updated them on what's going on with me in a while. My first month of marriage has been going well. We've missed the kids, having been without them for most of the month, but we'll be reunited this weekend.  My wife and I drove out to Crawford, TX to see what would happen when the Michael Moore film, Fahrenheit 9/11 came to town. We'd already seen the film. My interest lay in seeing the turnout and the chemistry that would undoubtedly erupt when the groups who supported Moore's message met up with Bush's backers. The town was crammed with cars. The inflatable projection screen was erected in a place called Tonkawa Falls Park, an RV park that was not designed to handle the throngs that trekked out to attend the screening. The toughest part of the visit was finding a parking spot. One Crawford resident was fiercely defending his own "no parking" policy in front of his house. He was mostly successful, too. Only one vehicle managed to park in front of his house, where more than a dozen could have parked. For the most part, the worst examples of each support group turned out: the "Moores" looked like they lived in the RV park. The "Bushes" looked like they were born in the RV park. Then there was the press. Not more than a generation removed from the gypsies that spawned them, the reporters and photogs from network affiliates lingered and stared at the crowd, hoping to get a shot of something useful before the light fell away.   We had to leave early, due to the fact that I was suffering from a stomach ache brought about by a conflict between my gut and a frozen pizza. Still, we stayed long enough to see a moron proudly wielding a sign that read, "Kerry is a Fairy" (I wonder how long it took him to come up with that impressive bit of poetry), and the rest of the mentally vacant who admitted that, even though they had never seen the Moore film, were adamantly opposed to it.
