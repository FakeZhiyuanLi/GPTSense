       urlLink    once again, the comic is self-explainatory.  it seems mine make a whole lot more sense in and of themselves than aputcae's.  which is the point.  however, you might say mine aren't as "artistic"....  *ahem*  umm...yeah...well, that pretty much explains the plot. one thing i forgot to mention was the role of the minor characters. trigun is aputcae's fellow swordsman and friend--he appears a couple of times--the like to spar against each other.  i'm the other character, and my point is...er...to torture him, i guess (i can whoop both him and trigun in a battle!!  booyah!!  whoa...i don't normally talk like that....).  oh, yeah, and i hate typing with captials, so i'm not anymore.  sorry.

       urlLink    I think the comic is pretty self-explainatory.  Basically, I'm Bery, an alien from the planet Crouton, also owner of a working lightsaber and a starship.  I happen to live here with this "Aputcae" person for the time being (he's supposed to be my brother....)--meaning, as soon as I go back to school in the fall, all of my posts will be from far, far away.  Well, maybe not as far away as I'd like.

      tim looked around. he was scared...but he didnt know why. it really was not a surprise to him when his sister came to the door of his room. "heh. you look like you've just seen a ghost," she said plainly while looking around suspicioulsy, "or maybe you have my book i've been looking for....yeah?" "what book." "o com'on you know you've got it....i've been reading it...and you..." "no. i dont have your book...promise...hope to die." "that's what you always say..." "the same with you." "...ok...well....why are you standing there then...?" "not because i stole your book...or anything," time said this with purposeful guilt in his voice, just to annoy his sister.  tim found this fun, annoying his sister, very much so. "tim...fess up...you're wasting my valuable time." "likewise." "yeah." "yep." tim and andromeda, the name to tim's sister, always ended pointless conversations by saying "yeah", or something simliar.

      2  Gwen went to the door and opened it to find none other than her good friend and crush who happened to be her brother's best friend, Tommy the paper boy. He was there for the monthly collection. In the distance Gwen saw a deer near the trees in her front yard, so she assumed that was why tweezer was barking. "Hi," said Gwen cheerfully. "Hello there...uh...I'm here for the monthly collection," said Tommy. Gwen giggled softly. "Of course," she answered him, "just a minute, come in and have a seat if you'd like." "Sure," he replied nervously. He walked in and had a seat in chair.  Gwen went to her mom's desk and got the sealed envelope labeled "paperboy" on the front. She returned and gave it to Tommy.  "Hey, maybe you can come with me and Philip when we go on our adventure today," she stated. "Umm...Okay, I guess. I'll ask my mom if I can go," he said blushing slightly and smiling sheepishly. "Cool, we're leaving at eight, so hurry up and come back over here as soon as you finish your route and talk to your mom." "You got it!"  Then he left. As soon as he was gone, Gwen finished her small breakfast and rushed to her room to get ready to go. She packed a small backpack of stuff to take including: bottled water, a first aid kit, and a map.  A little later the phone rang and she answered it. It was Tommy calling to say he would be there at 7:45. She was so excited! Could the planned adventure be any better? Gwen waited and waited. Finally, it was 7:45, and Tommy and Philip were nearly ready to go. The three decided not to take Tweezer on this adventure. It would be such a long one, and Tweezer had trouble at really rocky parts. Philip promised to Tweezer that he would take him on a hike the next day. They were ready to leave, the adventure had just begun!

      this one has an important story for ye....me made it upishness.....and me hopes ye may find somethin out of itishness.....be in the state of the enjoyinishness!----- there was once a young boy...but not too young.  he was becoming of age and all was not well...not quite well, at least.  the boy had many a troubles in his spirit.  his father...he hated.  he hated his father without any remorse.  before a pleasant thought would come into his heart that was of his father there would be pigs that could fly.  or so it would seem.  indeed...his father was troublesome.  his father was very, much so troublesome.  but this boy's dad was not at all an evil person.  his dad was far from evil,...yet this boy failed to recognize that his father was working on his "faults.".... one dark day this boy came to a point far advanced from hate.  a hate that demons craved for.  after a very discouraging session with his father, the boy went and concealed himself inside his room.  as time grew older, as time always does, the boy became bored and weary of rest.  very weary of rest he was, so this boy decided to play a game.  a game of darts he decided to play.  when the times in which he through the series of darts became many, the boy started to think of somethin new he could do with his time.  the demons handed his spirited the hate the boy had fed them. the demons handed it swiftly to the spirit of the boy. the spirit, trying to calm its host, accepted it without arguements.  the boy was playin a new game. a new game the boy was playing. the same game had grown into a murderer. three circles within the board on which the game was played came to be known for somethin to the player. the outer, biggest circle was set to let the boy's father lead the rest of his life in misery. the middle, big...ish circle swallowed by the outer, bigger circle was set to plague the boy's father with disease.  the "bull's eye" of the board held the most sinister curse of all.  the boy set this to kill everyone his father cherished...then after time had passed...kill his father... heh...it's the kindest thing i can do...for such a pathetic fool as my dad....  and so, time allowed this boy to play his revised game of darts. time allowed this boy to play his revised game of darts, just long enough for the vengeful boy to strike at the "bull's eye". indeed. the boy jumped with glee, not yet realizing what the action he had just been in the performing really meant. but sure enough. sure enough indeed. the intelligent, but not too intelligent, this boy figured out what his action had meant. he knew, deep in his own heart. very deep in his own heart. that his father loved him. but it sure was a good thing it was just a game. indeed it was a good thing.     ...to be continuedishness....

      this wandering blog seems to not have much to it...i think i'll write a story in it...MUAHAHAHA...so...here's the beginning to THE STORY...hmm...first i think i'll need a title....but what to call it...(i already have a plot forming in my head....indeed...hmm...ishness...) ah...i'll call it "shower of sparkles" well..this is the start...   Shower of Sparkles  Upon the break of dawn on the day of the thirteenth birthday of Gwendolyn Elena Welch, the ecstatic youngster leapt out of bed and ran down the stairs shouting "YIPPEEEEEEE". This woke up her family, the pets, and possibly a neighbor or two. Gwen, as she was called, barged into her older brother's room, ripped the blankets off of him, and pulled him out of his bed. Her brother was a tall lanky boy with brown hair and blue eyes. He usually had a weird sort of half smile on his face, and he was a very friendly, yet somewhat shy boy. Gwen wasn't very much like her brother at all. She had blond hair and brown eyes. Gwen was very outgoing unlike her brother. They were both very friendly and kind, though. "Hey, what'd ya do that for?" asked her brother Philip. "Don't ya know...? It's my birthday!" exclaimed Gwen. "That's NO reason to yank a guy out of a really good dream," replied Philip. Gwen answered him saying, "But, this isn't just  any  birthday. This is my  thirteenth  birthday." "Good for you, wanna cookie or somethin'?" Philip responded. Starting to become frustrated, Gwen asked, "Don't you remember...?" "Remember what," said Philip. "Your promise! The one you made when I turned nine and you were fourteen. You told me that when I turned thirteen you would take me on a hike through the woods to the key keeper's cave to search for the secret passageway to the lake," stated Gwen putting emphasis on the words 'you' and 'your'. "Okay, okay...hold your horses...we've got all day" he said. "But you said we would make sure to get an early start..." "We'll leave at eight. Deal?" "Deal." Gwen left, but not soon enough. Her dad was stomping down the hall in anger and she happened to bump into him on her way out of her Philip's room. "What is the meaning of this, young lady," shouted Mr. Welch. "Huh?...What'd I do?" "You were shouting way too loud! Tweezer started yelping and your mother was frightened half to death," yelled the furious father. "Ya know what, I'll let you off the hook THIS time, but only because it's your birthday, but don't go around screaming like that this early in the morning anymore" he said after calming down a bit. "It wasn't that loud..." she muttered under her breath. Her father didn't hear her, which was a good thing for her because if he had then she could forget the adventure with Philip. She later realized that it would be unpleasant to wake up to someone shouting like that so she apologized and was forgiven. Gwen then went and celebrated quietly the beginning of the day by herself while fixing a bowl of cereal for breakfast. Philip had gone back to sleep, as well as Gwen's parents. Tweezer, her dog, started incessantly barking at something outside. Tweezer was a young yellow lab who was very friendly, and rarely barked at anything. Then, there was a knock at the door. Tweezer was usually very friendly with strangers, so his barking at a person seemed very odd.  Who would knock on the door this early in the morning, and why would tweezer bark so much , Gwen thought.

"to memorial gate"ishness indeed..... me had remembered such a place....from a very long time ago.....ishness....me dadish person (who is...like in the bein of an expert forest walker....er...atleast in the woods me am in the wanderin in at leastishness...lol....^^;....).....was in the takin me and trigun when we were just about in our eleventh year of lifeishness....er somethin like that indeed.....so....me figured me wouldnt be quite as lost if me travelled the way to memorial gateishness indeed..... so me changed me course onto the path that is in the leadin to memorial gateishness....^_^ many time passings later....me reached the end of the pathishness.....mowom....it was the longest thingy me had ever been on.....oo......phew.....me reached memorial gateishness!!!!....heheh. which according to the little thingy.....is in the bein to the dedicated to john hitchcock.....from long ago...who used to be caretaker of the woodish place......which is called...the hitchcock woods.......about two-thousandish acre thingys of...er...forestish stuffs...indeed...oo;...... so it was in the comin to pass....that me realized how close me had come to the other sideishness of the woods.....(from the south side....to the north side.....which was where me was gonna be in the arrivin quite soonishness indeed....^^......;....)....but in order to complete the journey to the other side of the forestishness....me had to go down the one and only path that was in the leadin to itishness....... the devils backbone.... me thought the name was kinda wierdishness.... later me knew for sure there was nothin strange about it at all.....twasnt even that long of a ..er.....backboneish thingy indeed ^^;....and after me reached its end...me ended up....at the most northern point of the woodish place indeed...... this is where.....me was in the realizin...the fact that me was still in the needin to get to the homeish place..... me was fadin physicallyishness.....me had pushed meself more than me thought me would be in the doin soishness indeed.....^^;...... so me sat down...and rested for a few beings of time called minuteishnesses....... me poor companion was in the exhaustedishness.....(dont worry.....he is in the makin it backishness....er..along with me as ye can be in the noticin indeed...from me er....ramblingishnesses....indeed....^^;....)......... around this bein of time...me was in the seein....that the sun...(me was not in the possessin of a time teller.....indeedishness...--;....)....had sunken from two hours past noon to..er....alot laterishness....oo;.... this is about the timeishness this one was in the settin off from me restin spot..... and came to the gatewayishness....into the woodishes place....^^;.... me chose the path of the gate thingy.......(me was tryin to find a quicker way back to the homeish place...than the way me was in the wanderin to the gateish thingy indeed ^^;...ishnessess....).....and....to make this long tale short..... me had a re-encounter with the sandish river thingy....(me has not been in the tellin peoples about that thingy......)....but twas kinda like the dangerous bog thingy....just without a danger sign...indeed ^^;.....but......the thingy is....that it turns into quicksand after rainishness....but otherwise...tis like a desertishness..... me was in the walkin down such a thingy....for time's sake....(me knew that it was in the leadin close to the homeish place indeed ^_^)......but.....me then discovered...somethin life threateningishness.... about a half of a distance thingy called a mile down the sand river.....there was a spot....where the water had not been absorbed into the sandishness....me was in the seein this....when me dog was in the steppin on itishness....oo;....me remembered from me encounter with the dangerous bogish place....the behavior of quick sand.....indeed...but me dog need not fear the stuffs...do to his weight on more than two legishnesses thingy...indeed....but....despite me learning of the quicksandish stuffs...me told meself me was too far down from where me was in the beinishness....so me felt with me grandish staff thingy....(has saved me life....er...literally...many a timeishnesses.....oo;....)....and stepped out onto a different part of the cursed sand stuffs.....and took another step...then anotherishness....then another....and then anotherishness...then....ploop!......OO!.....mowom!.....me feet......but....fortunately....me steps.....were....er.....lol....indeed.....and me grabbed onto the fallen tree...(which are extremely common in bogish places...lolishness...^^;...)....and pulled meself out...indeed.....besides.....twas only me feet...heheh. so me ended up findin a place higher up by following the trunk of the treeishnessess....and went back to the dryish part of the sand river...and ran........ twas then me was in the officially tellin meself...that me was in the fadinishness hmmmishness.....this is personishness that is named bryce keeps a botherin meishness.... "ahola that means hello" thats all he is ever in the doinishness to this one...make fun of the ways of a wanderer....indeed.........he keeps a sayin "ahola that means hello" and then signs off and says that alot and then says some..er.....thingys....and then is in the signin off againishness... o wellz... anyway...indeedishness....^^;... the point is....me was in the makin it backishness! heheh. lol.... twas kinda lateishness...and me parents started to be in the worryin.....but....all was wellishness and the moral of the story is.... mow! indeed see ye!

       okishness... so...ummmm....me has thought it through.... and come up with a conclusionishnessess......indeed..... normal....like alot of other words......can be cut down and said....to have no true existence....indeed...very much so.....but for the illusion of the characteristics of the worldishness....one must keep certain meanings to the words and state of beingishnesses that have been createdishness...... without normal....there is no wierd...ishness....or different.... so.....one should never go around sayin that they are in the bein of the wierdishness.... then claim that there is no normalishness......because......without normal....there is no different or wierdishness.... indeedishness....everyone is very different from one another.....but there is a normality in people that other people form in their minds.....  okishness....this one is still cleanin these thoughts upishness.....but...indeedishness.... ^^;....lolishness.... see ye!
