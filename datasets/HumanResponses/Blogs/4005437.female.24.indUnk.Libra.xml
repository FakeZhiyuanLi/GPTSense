      Wow, the members here are growing quicker than I expected which was none :P I've made a few more friends since day before yesterday.. 2 of which I can actually say that I wouldn't mind speaking to everyday. The third is a bit on the off side.. He's too demanding and being in the service, I suppose that comes natural. But he makes me feel like I'm married to my ex husband all over again.. If I wanted that, I would have never left Germany in the first place.. But, this guy is kinda kinky and he likes to talk alot.. he really does have some interesting things to say about what went on in Iraq while he was there.. Thats about all I wanna hear from him. I have friends that can talk to me dirty and be tactful about it.. Needles to say.. Talk to the booty cause the hands off duty... (for those blondes out there such as myself, I mean that he can kiss my ass..) I always thought having someone demading would be fun til I had that chance. It sucks.. I feel like a child and like im being used.. Not for me.. Now, Tubly, you know your too young for me, but your cool and I like talking to you.. You need to get that girl closer or get on your parents insurance so you can go see her. And YOU... yea YOU.. you know who you are..I LOVE talking to you cause you don't ask for the dirty.. you let it come as it may. Which is why you have become my favorite.. Everyone should have a friend like you .. You are absolutly awesome :P

      I think I have decided to start a new collection.. I want lots and lots of Fairies. Mostly just the artwork. They are oh so pretty and mysterious. If I could be anything I wanna be, I'd be a fairy. A naked fairy with long white hair and big beautiful transparent wings. I'd keep my name as Angelicka. I would live in a Honeysuckle . If I were a fairy, I would fly at night and bring sweet dreams of candy and toys to the children. Id bring dreams of love and lust to the adults. Every person would have their own special dream that I would grant. Yea, I know.. I sound crazy again. Oh well. Like I said before, this is me and I'm not changing for anyone.. Cept' the Fairies. :)   C'mon... They are such tiny, wonderfully imaged , silent, graceful little creatures.. Too bad they are made up. Such an imaginary creature shouldn't be wasted on paper... Maybe they are real, who knows?

      Well, it seems that I have made a few new friends with the cam lastnight. Its amazing how good I feel about my physical self, too.  Guys want to see chicks naked and touching themselves unless they  are cool  enough  just to enjoy talking to. Which was my case lastnight until Dohn decided to slap his dick in my mouth for a little show. I hate blowjobs. Anyone who knows anything about me knows this. But, lastnight, I actually enjoyed giving Dohn a blowjob. Its all about being watched. I get off on that. I love knowing someone is watching. Call me werid or crazy. Call me whatever the fuck you want, but its how I feel and what makes me happy in that department. So, Mom in law is going away for a week come Friday... Dad in law is gonna be working. Dohn and I will have the house to ourselves. We will have a whole week of shows and no interruptions. I can't wait.. Gonna be fun.. Now to figure out how this lil angelic cyber babe is gonna make money off of this cam:)

      Blah blah blog.... I have read atleast 60 Blogs today. Yes I have nothing better to do with my time. However, I did learn something from these Blogs. Everyone one of those Bloggers also have nothing better to do with their time. Imagine that. But that's what makes a blog so special. So much time and thought put into a post and then posted for strangers to read. I also learned there's a lot of fucked up , boring, crazy, smart, kind, needy, and hopeless people out there. I think I fit all of those descriptions. So there for, my Blog and I are one. I haven't really written that much in my Blog, but it will grow before too long. This little head of mine is full of ranting and raving and thoughts of what IM not and what I wanna be. Its full of what I wanna do with my life and and what I could have done. Speaking of done, I think I'm done with worrying about how ugly I think I am. After getting this webcam and seeing myself on it everyday, I decided that I like what I see. Hell, I'd do me if I weren't me. :) I just can't wait till I reach my goal weight and I can't keep my hands off of myself, much less my husbands... Finally, I will get to look like all the pretty people I envy.

      Last night, my husband and I experimented with our new webcam. We put on a show for a male friend of mine. He says he enjoyed it and I know my husband and I both did. The fact that we knew someone was watching us make love made it all the more exciting. I didn't think that Id be able to get him to do it, but he was willing and ready much to my surprise. That was a great turn on. And now, I believe I have a regular costumer when I begin my webcam service. One down, many more to go. My friend and I have been friends for some time now. My husband, whom we'll call Dohn, isn't jealous that I have a close male friend . See, we have a very open relationship and we trust each other,. So he knows how I work and I know how he works to say the least. We love each other very very much and would never jeopardize our relationship. We have communication and trust. That's pretty much all we need besides the love we have.. That's all anyone really needs to have a good marriage. I love my marriage and I love my husband more than I love myself.

      Hiding, gathering the shadows.   Afraid to see the light of day.   How he feels, only he knows.   Afraid of what she will say.     Tired of trying to be her best,   Only to end up like the rest.   Together they confess,   The concealing shadows are the best.     Afraid to be alone.   Afraid to show deep feelings.   Afraid to return what's shown.   Afraid to be revealing.     Alas, the time has come   That they are one.   With the trees and the grass.   They are nature at last.

      Little chicken laughs in my face.   He says life is too expensive for my taste.   Then, he kicked me and called me names.   Now, I can't see straight.     Little chicken was right,   cause I lost taste in the very first bite.   Now, I have no appetite.     Little chicken got what was to come.   Down his throat I stuck my thumb.   He was fight'n and he was kick'n,   but in the end, I said, "Mmm, tastes like chicken."

      Well, we are back after a weekend of drinking , smoking pot, and me rolling and giving my husband a very good B... HAHA.. You thought I was going to say BJ.. Well, I wasn't you dirty minded homosapein. I gave him a very good birthday present. :) So, now that I am trying to update my blog, he sits infront of me at his computer looking at his fav porn sites again. Maybe he will watch me when I get the webcam going, instead of other women. Does that bother more women than just me? Or am I just too hard on him? Either way, its how I feel and what I feel is me and I don't believe anything can change that. And here I am again.. Rambling on.. Again.... While scanning through other peoples blocs, I came across this funny little carton link... Good shit.. Its a must watch. www.illwillpress.com . Well, off to go pick up our daughter.

      By the time I am 25, I wanna weigh 125lbs. I have 3 months to acomplish this goal. I weigh 140 atm. I wanna look like the Olsen Twins.. Yup, just like I puked after I ate. I wanna be thin and pretty with long hair and Diva clothes. I wanna turn heads just like every damn female in my husbands family does. I wanna be able to walk into a coffee shop to buy a Mocha Latte and walk out with my free Mocha Latte. I wanna walk in the mall and have someone give me a modeling career.  I want my husband to look at me the way he does those bitches in the porno movies or on his comp. I want him to think Im the best looking woman he has ever seen. (Like thats really gonna happen).  I used to hate myself alot more than I do now. Yes, I still hate myself but not to the same degree. You see, I have lost alot of weight since I had my daughter and I feel a little better about myself. But everytime I see my husbands sisters, I feel like this fat ass bitch who is not pretty and will never measure up to their standards. So, yes.. I hate myself.. or do I just hate my body? Hmmm.. I've never really thought about it as a body problem and not a mental problem. But I guess it is a mental problem cause I wouldn't hate me if I didn't have this ugly body. The strech marks weren't as bad as they are now.. But carrying a child has aftermaths. But, it doesn't take the blame for me being fat now. I have a double chin and my gut is my arms resting area when typing this blog entry.  I hate being ontop during sex cause my fat stomach hangs down and I find it very disgusting. It doesn't seem to bother my husband any, that he says, but it bothers me. I am going to drink lots of water and barely any food. Maybe by my 25th birthday I will be 125lbs. Yup, I can do it.. I think.. Maybe after Im 125, I can fit into those size 4 jeans I got. WOOHOO... )oh yea, my husband said my name over and over lastnight while making love to me.. He never does that.. Prolly cause I got mad at him for looking at all those pretty and thin bitches on his fav porn site lastnight.)

      written by Angelicka Fields    I feel the warmth of his body next to mine.  I feel the sweat of love turning the wheels of time.  I feel the breath of compassion bearing on my neck.  I feel the pressure of unity teaching me a lesson I'll never forget.     I see the love filled eyes of the satisfied man.  I see the truth of a soul that understands.  I see the window of the sorce that began this transaction.  I see the thank yous and your welcomes of our satisfaction.     I hear the longing for more than what hes recieved.  I hear the begging for more pleasure granted by me.  I hear the whimpering as he stains our sheets.  I hear the happiness in his voice created by me.

      Written by Anglicka Fields     In my darkness, faded black, behinde the light I hide. Too bright for me to feel the warmth of liers and evil doers. I hide in my saftey spot, hoping for some relief. I find comfort in my shelter of no color at all. This is my place for unity and soul searching. This is my world of happy thoughts, acid trips and meditation. I strive for a place called even and true. And then I fade away again. .and again..and again...     In my darkness, faded grey, behinde the dim light I sit. Just enough darkness mixed with light for me to feel the hate of enimies and tattle-tellers. I sit in my saftey spot, enjoying the relief. I found comfort in my shelter of grey. This is my place for friendship and soul sharing. This place joined my world of happy thoughts and shots of EverClear and meditation. And still I strive for a place called even and true. And then I fade away again.. and again.. and again....    In my darkness, faded white, behinde the pure wanderous light, I hide. Perfect light for me to see the truth of us, you and me and everyone else. I float on my saftey, enduring the reilef. I found comfort in my shelter of white. This is my place for purity and soul bearing, This place joined my darkeness and grey. I have found place called Even and True. And then I fade away again... and again.. and again....

      I was one of the biggest EQ fans you would have ever met. But today, I uninstalled every expasion I owned and said Fuck eq.. If I can' t log on with my password that I have had for 3 years, I don't need to play. Fuck SOE and their bullshit. Gues now Feo's Forum is gone.. Oh well, didn't get that much response anyways.

      Seems Im in the dumps a lot now days. Most of my problem is my in-laws . Mostly my husbands sisters. They are all bitches. They act like the own the fucking world. They may for all I know. With all the movies , modeling, promotions , they may just be the fucking cherry in my fucking virgin bloody mary. Whatever. Everytime they come over, its all me me me me me me me me me..well, guess what. Me.. Im here too. I have feelings, so stop fucking ignoring me or treating me like Im lower tan you.. Don't fucking tell me that I would look better if I did this or that.. Don't fucking tell me how pretty your baby is when you know damn well that I just lost one. Don't fucking tell me your fucking shit don't stink because your the one with the drinking problem.. Don't fucking tell me that I control my husband because Im not the one who tells her man, "I'm the woman and I WILL spend your money.. THE END!". Don't fucking tell me that I'm outta control. At least I know who the daddy of my baby is and Im not stringing someone else along making him think e was the daddy. Don't fucking tell me that I don't want to be apart of this family because your the one pushing me away. Don't fucking invite me to your kids birthday party when I invited you to my daughters and you showed up five hours later and said you forgot. Maybe I will forget too. Don't fucking even talk to me . Go away and take your flea infested dog with you!   Now, his mom is a different story on the same page. Always thinks she's right and you can never win with her. That would take a whole blog by itself!   So, I decided that when we move, I going to set up a webcam all through my house.. Im gonna be a cyber slut. And suprisingly, it was my husbands idea.. I just said I wanna make some money with out leaving the house. Our daughter starts school next month so I'll have all day alone. So, in about 2-3 months be looking for me.. HAHA.. I'll get paied to masturbate.. Bout damn time.. Shit.. I could be rich now! And Master Bob, you get to watch for free.. Cause you da man!! Wow, I feel better already!
