      got up late 'again' today, I slept late because of 'Survivor All Starr Final Episode' hahha, slept abt 2 o'clock. I was kinda disgusted with the way, the juries handles themselves, they let their prejudice & bruised ego rules their speech/vote.   What la wehh... the Rob guy is a schemer(for goodness sake they are all are :P) and he did play competitively, he helped to build a nice shack of theirs back at 'Chapera', he played aggressively, during challenge be it in tribe, or personal challenge. At least, Shi-Ann is honest, in her speech.. hehe the SHE-Devil-ANN, hahahha....   Anyway, wanna search the web later, to check on Rob & Amber latest outgoing, are they married yet ??? Or the proposal thingy, is another scheme of their, to share the 1 Mill dollar together... hahhahah. But Amber is kinda cute, with some meat on her skinny bones. And Rob looks 'almost' boyish without his beard.  But frankly,  think Rob deserve to win.... I vote for ROBB !!! ... hahha

      I'm kind busy today, my office just purchase a new video camera, as a replacement for the old one. The old digicam was stolen by someone, I have a rough idea who it is, but then again, I can't really prove it though.    the new video-cam is canon. been studying the manual the whole morning. hmm.. To much dials and setup (3 supported software for 1 single video-cam) ler I think.  hmm.... And the battery is a big failure, total recording time of 30 mins only.. duhh... What can we do, with battery that can last for only 30 mins. Gotta get an extra battery, just in case.  But the best part was, it can be a digicam, with a much highger zoom/close up that normal digicam. Well of course, it can't beat a SLR camera ler ....

      Yesterday was a terrible.. terrible nite for me. I went over to the airport (KLIA) to pick up some foreign workers. Yeahh.. Im working in a manufacturing sector, and most of the workers in production line are foreign workers(Indonesian).  Well, I tag along because they need a female companion for the new girls, cause my HR peeps are guys        So we started out the at 7.30pm, usually, it will only take about 45 mins to get to KLIA, but yesterday, it takes about 2 1/2 hr !! Why ?? There was a thunderstorm yesterday, after about 5-6 weeks of no rain.. and some part of the Highway was flooded, can you imagine that, highway.. flooded!! ** sighh.. so we have to make a few turn here & there, got diverted, only to found out, the next entrance to the highway is also flooded... Somehow, when we're trying to avoid the flooded area, we got lost(duhh..) So we stop at a nearby office building, and ask the security people over there, "HOW TO GET TO KLIA !"!, So the security guy, he guided us, all the way to the highway entrance, using the non-flooded route.. haiyaa... nasib baik ler...  At last, at 10.00pm, we manage to arrive at KLIA, and the flight already arrive for 1 1/2 hrs, kesian diorang lama tunggu. We did some medical( it is compulsory for foreign workers to undergo medical routine upon entering Malaysia )l, Immigration & custom clearance, all and all, we manage to finish it, at 12.30pm. Don't ask me why it takes so long to do that. We are not the only one who are picking up workers, there are some workers from Bangladesh, Nepal & Vietnam even. Luckily, Indonesian & Malaysian speak almost in the same tongue, so there is less communication problem, when handling the clearance and all.  Afterward, on the way back, we stop at the R&R for supper and for the girls to freshen-up. Manage to lodge them at their hostel at 2.00pm, and got back home at 2.30pm. Take my shower and fell asleep at 3.00pm. Darn exhausted....   Today, I come to office at 10.30am. I have to finish  some urgent work for my boss. He is leaving to Singapore tomorrow, and he need to compile all of the data, by today. He doesnt look to well though, must be the alcohol he had for breakfast. :P   **Sigh.. I should have taken a day off instead laa.. and go back to sleep... aiyark..

      I have a wedding reception to attend to this weekend. He is a good friend of mine, and I've known him for 6 yrs. He used to date a good friend of mine, but things turn sour between them. Luckily my friendship with him was not affected.  What to give to my friend as a present. I was thinking of going over to IKEA, and check out some reasonably price things for him. Money has been a bit tight this month, what's with my car road tax & insurance, so budget wise, I can't spend so much on the gift laa..  Should I give him a toaster ?? Or.. Water filter ?? er... Books ? Or should I just put some cash in the envelope   and it's up to him, to buy anything he likes.

      It's Monday morning, and I am not yet asleep. I'm on leave today, but all for the wrong reason. You see, last week my car got hit by a stupid driver, and I get a leave today, so I can bring over my car to the workshop to spray the bumper , and check the headlight cover & all. But the jerko did not return my call, so another leave day wasted.   I was thinking of going to work tomorrow, but my boss is such a pain in the neck when it comes to applying leave, might as well as I resume my leave, and catch troy or van helsing tomorrow on movies.  so why am I up still ??? This Microsoft XP and its security cookies and everything, block a ftp website that I'm trying to access, duhh....  So, just 5 minutes ago did I manage to turn off the features.. duhhh.. again... I'm getting some office work done and e-mail it to my workmate, for his perusal.  crappp monday...

      I had honey turkey sandwich for lunch today, the turkey was nice, cheesy nyumm nyumm... dave's deli menus improves from time to time, I only wish they have a bigger glass for ice lemon tea...   and afterward.. I went to watch Harry potter 4, with my siblings... Luckily, I manage to do phone booking on last Wednesday to secure 4 tickets for us. When we got to the cinema, the line at the ticket counter was about 200 meter long.. Yes!! I am not pulling your leg. Shopping mall during weekend, & school holiday is a danger zone, full of teenagers bopping around... Avoid it if you can !!!  well anyway, the four of us has a great time ! Surprisingly, the movie does not steer far off from the book, but there are some parts in the books that I wish they featured it, in the movie.  1. The face of malfoy when Harry got firebolt from his god-dad 2. More details on Harry learning the patronus charm 3. Scene when sirius tray to stab 'Ron' (he was looking for scabbers actually) in their dormitory  ...And lots more, anyway, I know they cant cramm all those up in a 2 hr movie... I give them thumbs up for the dementor part, it is really is more scary that I imagine the dementor before.. Spooky.~~~  the show stealer is of course, Ron, he resembles 'Ron' from the book... So much..  and yess.. I cant believe it is Emma Thompson who plays prof. trelawney... weirdo.. Especially during her 'foreseeing' freak me out when she grab Harry shoulders..  hehhehe.. best !

      Was reading nick hornby:high fidelity the other day, the hero was a bit obsessed about top 5 things in his life... So here is one of my top 5 list   top 5 most humiliating/disastrous event  1. Standard two, this dirty, naughty, scruffy looking boy has a crush on me, and make it know to other people. It was so embarrassing.. He even send some love letter, at my house post box, inviting me for a session of badminton (Malaysia was winning Thomas cup at that time) he even smiles at me in a weird way, I was deadly scarred of the opposite sex at that time.. yuckss.. yuckss..  2. At some family dinner with my bf family. Peek into the dinner bill, was thinking that it was my boyfriend who is going to pay for it, so I just wondered, how much is the buffet cost per head, but, the bill was pick-up by his brother, who look at me strangely.  3. At the movie waiting area, was in rapture with some movie posters, accidentally link my hands to some 'aci' hands, babbling, thinking it was my friend, who was standing next to me. When I turn over, saw the aci looks at me strangely. I manage to say sorry, keep a straight face, and ran to my friends who was all laughing at me  4. Got caught for 'trying' to cut school, it was the 1st time. As a punishment, me & my friends have to wash the teachers' room dirty windows. Tried to act nonchalant about it & maintained some dignity, with other student snickered when the pass by us. Never tried to cut school after that.  5. Receive a phone call at my handphone, from my boyfriend's dad. He was asking, who is this ?? Who's phone number is this?? (my HP number) because my number seems to appear repeatedly in their house's phone bill. Was not really sure, who is embarrassed most, me or him.. hmmm

Apparently azna's older brother is competing, and we are there for moral support... (?) hahhaa..  anyway, according to my lil bro, who was watching the show at home, he saw me 3 times, during the show.. haa... not bad... not bad at all...  maybe I'll be going for the final day, on Friday, to see whether azna's brother make it or not...  cherios !!

      this has been quite a hectic week for me. well.. which week does not. i have not even have time to wrriten up on my blog.. t.G.i.F..... **fuhhh  but the is a silver lining in the grey week is, i feel totally connected, with my newfound closeness, with my boyfriend. it has bring me, much pleasure, that i have anticipate it before. we started quite ackwardly, on me being a bit apprehensive, on talking to him, about such intimate matter, but i believe, that he must know, so i told him.  He took it quite well, and I found out, that instead of him feeling repulsive or anything, it is quite the opposite, he encourage me to pursue it, he is very concern about my health & wellbeing, even before, and after the test. it touched me, to see his musing 'sorta like mother hen, on me, but i like it:)' ..and he promise me the next visit i have, he would want to accompany me as well... :)  Well, that is the other side of him that i learn, and im glad that i share the news with him. love you lotsa.. roza     **Title taken from On Love, The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran

      I have been through a few relationship in my life. The first time I though I was in love, is when I was 17, and he I 24 (I always seem to have  a knack for older man) I admire his liveliness and his sense of humor !! + he is cute too!!  We go out on a few dates, movies, dinner & drinks... etc. things start blooming... but suddenly, I got called away to kuantan, for my tertiary studies. so I was at kuantan... exchange a few long distance phonecall with him. when I went back on holiday break, we went out together..  then I found out, that he is going out with some other girl. I was a bit shocked at the moment... and decided to forget all about him. I did not called him or anything. and since I am staying in hostel in kuantan, he is unable to reach me as well. hmm. there was never really an understanding establish between us, so it wasn't really his fault laa... it was about 4-5 month thing only.. but I really like him.. but I learn to accept it and make peace with it..  the second time I believe myself to be in love is, with another older guy, I am 19, and he is 29 or was it 30.. this is one of the funny relationship I have, I think he is in awe with me, because oh my youth, and my outgoing personality, (and of course my wonderful smile, and intelligent wit hehhe.. !!) while he himself is a quiet little man, I was kinda lonely at that time, my goodfriend is always hanging out with her boyfriend, which is a good friend of mine as well.. I was always the thirdwheel, so when he ask me out, I accept it, without much thinking, I don't really like him, let alone love, more like... I use him, as a comfort boyfriend , I've only realize it when we have an ugly fight, and have not spoken ever since.... after that...whenever our path crossed, we didn't even say any word, and just ignore each other.. but what I suspected is, he is jealous of another friend of mine, a younger guy, who is always asking me out for a drink... so one day, while I was kinda bored doing nothing, he is busy with work, he owns a cybercafe (yeahh yeahh..) this friend of mine, comes over to the cc, and ask me out for a drink... he is with another guy, so I thought it was ok with him, but it seems like he doesn't think so... he was jealous on it.. We begin to have some small arguments & misunderstanding,  the break-up does not effect me much, which does not surprise me at all..  he was not even handsome, maybe in his younger days, he can be consider cute, but not at 30, he looks much older that his age, it was a foolish act, I grant you  my third boyfriend, guess who.... jeng jeng jeng... yeah.. it was the friend who I went out for a drink with. so it is true, he has been trying to hit on me for a while. I was still in kuantan, so is he. but he got a job offer in kl, and move over to kl, and ask me for my phone no. so not to loose contact, it was august/september, so he is in kl, I am in kuantan, but we chat everyday, and make some plans to go out together, at kl. I finish my studies on november, and december, january & february come.. We go out almost every week. seronok... !! he started to talk about marriage, ahahaha... and I go and laugh at his idea, of me, getting married at the age of 20 ??. meanwhile I got a job offer, starting off february, and things started to goes downhill... he is working with government, and I am in private sector, I work late hours, and my position/pay is higher that he is, and he begins to see, that I am not a marriage material kinda girl (don't want meet his parents yet/ don't wanna him to meet my parents yet)   so.. he started seeing other people behind my back, we go out less, less phonecall from him, I hardly notice, due to my attention at work, he has being going around my back, and a few girlfriend on tow... pity me, I confront him about it, at he told me the truth... he has gotten engage !!!, to say I was shock, that would be an understatement. I was angry, shock, humiliated, disappointed, embarrassed and all in all together, but I hold my temper in check, I ask him a few question, he answer me boredly, I hang up, and felt this sickening feeling at my heart, that lasted for 1 day, I hardly felt anything, I did not even cry, all that is going on in my head is, how could anybody do something like this?? I goes the 3 phase, self victim/pity down to anger/resentment to him, and finally, I got over it, it's his lost anyway. ohh.. but I emerge the winner afterall...his fiancee, was a loose girl, and has been sleeping around with other man, and he break off with her, and married somebody else... it amazes me to see, how he easily he jumps in/out relationship.. with other girl  looking back at my previous relationship, makes me open my eyes, looks / physical / monetary is not an important issue, it's the person heart, and soul which is most important, compatibility which each other, mindset and hopes & dreams, and great love of each other, is what will keep the relationship going...

      I was having a conversation via-phone with my boyfriends, and we are talking and stuff.. Then suddenly, he ask me, ehh...' have you ask your sister about my request ??'  I was like.. (automatically thinking about last Saturday discussion, on when are going to get married, so not to co-incite with my sisters planning and all ..) so I told him.. Not yet... Then he said... 'better you inform her, earlier, if later, I'm afraid, that we cannot make it',   so I go like, err.. Are you sure, you wanna get married end of next year, and he goes 'what ? Next year?' then he laugh and say 'no la, I was asking, if you have ask your sister, to buy us 2 tickets for spiderman this weekend..' and I was like 'haa.. I ingat u tanya pasal kawen.. ' hehhehehhahahahahha!!! duhh.... duhh... malu.. malu.... hahhaa..   this will definitely goes to my top 5, most humiliating things event

      I had a great weekend. Manage to catch the 3.40pm spideyman show at GSC, grab some japanese food. The movie was good, tobey mcguire plays the tormented hero, very well..!! kirsten dunst well, she plays the damsel in distress act as per normal i guess...  haaa..altogether a great day with my boyfriend. euchh.. i'm getting mushy-wushy...   ok well, since I already written about my ex boyfriends, I feel like it is only fair if I were to write about my boyfriend as well. let see, we have been going out for about 3 years, yeahh... amazing isn't it ? previous relationship I had doesn't even last a year. (!) hhaha..  well.. we gotto know each other via internet... we are playing a quiz game, and he keeps winning, I'm a sore looser, and kinda despise him in a way... but he keeps trying to talk to me, & I will make some stupid or sarcastic reply, but somehow, between here & there, we hit it off, it's like, we kinda have a connection or something..  we went out after 1 month chatting at mirc/msn msgr & telephone.. we only go out again, after 2 weeks and ever since that, we started to see each other. everything seems to fall nicely into it's place. it was very enlightening meeting him, he is funny, well-informed, intelligent & artistic (he is an interior designer !) he is a romantic soul, and kind hearted. that is among his many great traits  that I found out, with our years together. , he is so understanding, and patient...  and can be a big baby when he is upset (he will start to mumble non-stop)... hahaha...  and not to forget, handsome too.... (!)  we have always celebrate our anniversary, on 18th october, that is the first day that we chat.. I am eternally grateful that I have found my soulmate, my better half, the yang-to my ying (borrow roza's quote) and we are very much in love, and I really hope and I pray to god, that the love we share, will last for a a lifetime...

       i was driving along the sungai buloh-shah alam route, with it's usual traffic..    &nbsp;  before i pass&nbsp;subang bestari turn, i notice from afar, that there a a few cars waiting&nbsp;their turn to turn to subang bestari, so being a good citizen as i am, i slowed down my car, to allow a few cars, to turn to subang bestari, but this stupid keling driver, who is driving behind me, keep honking me, and even tried to overtake me from the left side, stupid man.. !!&nbsp; i think that i am foolish to allow those car to go first, isntead of just drive straight through..    &nbsp;  i was so piss off with the guy, that immediately after the turn, i speed up my car to not allow him to overtake me, but i think his ego is the size of giant kelana jaya, where&nbsp;he keeps on speeding, on my left side, and over take me..    &nbsp;  what a wimp.....

      I am somehow having some kinda doubts in my life, of where I am heading, what will I be doing, from 5 yrs onwards..&nbsp;ohh don't get met wrong, it's not the afterlife thingy, but more towards career wise... I have been stuck here, in the same company, same position&nbsp;for about 3 yrs now.. yeah.. !! I am thinking of starting to find another job, better prospect, workings conditions, more challenge,&nbsp;salary wise etc...   why ??&nbsp; I have been thinking about this for quite sometime.. but now, with my company not doing very well, management have sunk to zero level of attitude with workers.. competition from china, on manufaturing cost / labor cost, iskk.. yeahh sucks big time there.. it does give a kickstart that I needed...   I am doing&nbsp;IT at the moment, no major programming, more like coordinating between company & software house, for development,&nbsp;I deal with suppliers for IT peripheral....   switching career track ? kinda like a good idea, but feel a bit daunted by it... should I go for&nbsp;sales ? admin / secretarial job ??? haaa...... head ache.. head ache...   ada jawatan kosong tak ?? memana... hahha  &nbsp;
