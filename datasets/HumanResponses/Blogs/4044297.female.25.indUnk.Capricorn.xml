       My friend told me about this and at first I thought it was cool for some people, but not for me.&nbsp; Well, I realized that I can't keep going through this cycle of all of my feelings and emotions.&nbsp; Not that I don't have a great family and awesome friends that listen, but somehow it doesn't completely help.&nbsp; I feel like I am on this non-stop rollercoaster of emotions.&nbsp; One of my main problems is that I can never hate anyone.&nbsp; No matter what they do to me, if I ever cared about someone, they can do no wrong.&nbsp; Which really sucks because no matter what they do I somehow&nbsp;find the good in their actions.&nbsp; This makes it so I can never let go.&nbsp; In my current situation, nothing was ever wrong.&nbsp; My boyfriend always made me feel like I was a queen.&nbsp; He put me on a pedestal and did everything right.&nbsp; He was so respectful and sweet.&nbsp; I never felt so loved and so special in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't take him for granted either.&nbsp; I was always doing sweet little things for him as well.&nbsp; Then one day he out of the blue broke up with me.&nbsp; And from there I feel like&nbsp;I have done everything wrong.&nbsp; I've tried to hold on, I've tried to let go.&nbsp; No matter what I still feel the love.&nbsp; I try to tell myself to let it go, but it is the one thing I believe in and then I smile again because I belive in something.&nbsp; Thus the cycle of up and down emotions starts again.&nbsp; Since the break up I haven't just been moping or anything.&nbsp; In fact I've been more social and outgoing than ever.&nbsp; But I am getting to a point where I am tired of it.&nbsp; I want to just feel OK in staying home one night and not having to worry about thinking of everything.&nbsp; Bcause that's what happens when I am alone.&nbsp; I think, and think and think and think until I drive myself to tears or else a gallon of icecream.&nbsp; I still love him, I do.&nbsp; And I know it was all real, I could see it and feel it and I know he did too.&nbsp; So what the hell happened?
