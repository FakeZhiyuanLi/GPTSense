      i hate humans.  i depise, loathe, abhor them.  yesterday was one of the worst days of my life.  besides the whole guiltguiltguilt feeling nagging at me all day something really bad happened. i was walking to meet some of my friends, when i heard voices to my right.  i looked up quickly to see two guys around 18 years old who smiled at me.  i kept my gaze down until i heard "hey tinkerbell come and give me some pixie dust."  a few seconds later i felt hands on my wrists and a hand across my mouth.  i screamed as loud as i could before i kicked them and bolted.  i felt like a small animal running away from a hunter.  i was so fucking scared. i was glad when i saw lulu and justin and they looked genuinely concerned, justin gave me a hug and lulu told me it was ok....and it made me feel 10 times better. fred, pip, and ryan made me feel better too....they were nice and weren't all..."you stupid whore."  im glad i know people that actually give a damn.  thank god for you kids. and yay for nick for making me smile when i was depressed. *glomp!* lol. that's all for now folks..... by the way: my new theme song = "ugly girl" by jack off jill. check it out shitlets. love, nikki

      alrighty....here i am....again.  and yet i have so much to say, i know not how to phrase it.  i didn't want to depressify my xanga so i thought i could let it out where nobody else could read it....save for the select few who might recieve this URL.   the other night i went out and i had an anxious feeling.  this was because i was supposed to meet my friend's "boyfriend" there because my dear friend mle wanted to set us up.  little did i know that i was going to like him this much after seeing him once in person and talking to him a few times online.  it was utterly ridiculous and completely out of the question in my mind.   maybe i should stop thinking.  because now im in quite a predicament.  i read his xanga today and i nearly had a heart attack...."Friday, June 25, 2004   I can't do this anymore, I just can't, and it's not fair to me, but mostly to you. "  our "date" had been june 24th.  i really hope he wasn't referring to his "girlfriend".  but i also knew what mle had told me: "if a date with someone else goes well .. then yea he wants to end things with erica."   WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO!?!?!?!  i like this kid and erica is my friend, i dun wanna hurt anyone and i end up getting hurt.  this fucking sucks.  i hate love.  i hate everything that it entails and i hate the aftermath.   i surrender, just make it stop....the spinning that makes the world tilt back and forth is giving me a migraine....and i want it to go away...please i beseech of you, make it all go away...

       P O N D E R .   indeed.  things have seemed to change.  and they have, for cereal.  i thought i was happy with the changes but when i face myself at the end of the day, i know that im not.  there's so many things, feelings, and thoughts pounding incessantly through my already exhausted brain.  it's driving me further and further to the brink of insanity....one of these days i'll breach the brink and tumble down.  b o y s . . .  hmm, this is interesting.  i like two guys...still.  and i have no idea what to do.  as i said before, the reprecussions with boy #1 still remain but i still find myself drawn to his warmth.  and boy #2...well...*sweatdrop* i do not understand him in the least.  and yet, he cracks me up and im drawn to him as well.  what's a girl to do?  im so glad that kagome is happily together with alan for now at least one of us is settled.  f a m i l y . . .  i am the blacksheep.  it is official.  i scare off all of my family members.  well, bobo doesn't count because he's not even 2.  oh well....what a travesty.  f r i e n d s . . .  why are you drifting farther and farther away from me?  or is it me that's drifting?  i miss you all...and i feel almost betrayed.  just know that, although most of you (if not all of) don't read this, i love you to death and i'll always be there for each and every one of you.  m i s c e l l a n e o u s . . .  whatever.  i don't feel like typing all of those changes.  just know...........things changed. *nods solemnly*  in conclusion, my head hurts.  farewell my darlings........f a r e w e l l.

      D E P R E S S E D. &nbsp; why does it seem that everytime the people around me are genuinely happy, im genuinely depressed?&nbsp; i love you all to death and im so glad you can be happy.&nbsp; it's just that the storms have gone and i still can't find my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow...im getting sick of searching.&nbsp; i can't seem to find the one thing that keeps me going...my motivation to get up in the morning,&nbsp; my reason for living.&nbsp;  &nbsp; until i find that reason i shall don my mask of happiness and pretend that im fine with my life.&nbsp; that i don't care about anything.&nbsp; until then i'll be artificial nikki.&nbsp; fake smiles all from concentrate.&nbsp;  &nbsp; wish me luck...xoxox...nikki

      I F O N L Y I W A S I N T O X I C A T E D . . .  maybe then i wouldn't feel so numb.  what am i gonna do about this!?!  it just keeps getting worse and worse.....eating away at me like a parasite.  she still loves him.  she wants them to be together.  he means the world to her.  mle told me that it had ended.  i guess not.  but he's always the one telling me i make him happy and that i'm an angel.  and im supposed to think that he hates me?  maybe im just being retarded but......merr.  and with the other boy, it's ridiculous.  he's sweet and funny and then the head in his pants takes over.  goddamnit i hate this so much.   i know i like the first guy, and i think i like the second but i honestly can't decipher my own feelings....the messages from my brain and heart are getting confused.   i just wanna sit in my compy chair and cry and wait for somebody to sit beside me and tell me it's ok.  to hold me so i don't feel alone.  basically i want a fairy godmother to wave her magic wand and make everything better.  i have a gut instinct that my 16th b-day party will be one that nobody will ever forget.  i dun think my dad is going...i dun think he can.  and that's what sucks the most.  i want him to be there but he can't.  and if he shows up, im afraid of what might happen.   i just want to lay down and sleep for the next 2 years.  im tired of life and im tired of kissing frogs.  where the fuck is my prince?  if you see him, please tell him that i went to sleep and if he kisses me, i just might wake up....  until then my lovelies... goodnight .
