         Tomorrow would be my mom's birthday and another friend as well so with massive traffic jam on a weekend my dad and I decided to take her out on an all you can eat and shop till drop day. Like any other day I would go to work and meet em' there later that was until the kitchen's switch board's wire got over loaded.          Waiting for rescuers to come I was stuck there to fend for myself with a horny bi**h, new staffs and one that just doesn't care. Not the way I would have had my day start. Pacing up and down the walk way with nothing that can be done, I then of course tried the"how can I save the day theory". Finally after 3 hours, my chef comes in to replace me, making me 2 hours late for my own mother's birthday lunch. It ain't that bad I said, still have a chance to make up for the lateness... shopping here we come!!!          Shopping! What could go wrong?! I said.. me and my big fat mouth!           Running around looking for something special I decided to spluge a lil for her inner-wear. Happy and smiling from ear to ear she walked into high end shop only to run out seconds later with me trying to catch hold of her and pulling her back in. Too expensive and I'm looking for undies not braaaasss..!! Confidently I showed her a 3 in one pack of comfortable, beautiful, silky smooth lycra undies and she freaked! Running for her was out of the question this time as I was holding one too many packs in my hand. Finally laughing outside with my dad she tells me that she rather spend money on good old cotton... that's comfort and cheap! Giving up the fight I then later bought her normal cotton panties (three in total) and spent 10 bucksless than I have originally planned for the new lycra ones. Moms... go figure?! Then more window shoppin and runnin from pricy evening wear. Huuuh...! Once a year and she makes me run after her.. is this payback for those year she ran after me when I was a kid?          Well here I am back at home exhausted from the running and full from the Dunkin donuts I just ate that no matter what, moms will always love us a tad more than we ever will. (at least my mom does)          Great now she's trying to return the darn 50 bucks! Should've pull all the tags off!

        Another days goes by as work pilles up over my head, lacking of sleep and as usual food.... "How can one working in a restaurant not have enough food you say?!" That's easy... not having enough time to remember to have food! Lame!!! I know... but somehow I always remember my alcohol.        &nbsp;    Just a couple of hours ago I was thinking to myself, this constant need of alcohol in my life to make it normal... does it make me an alcoholic? What constitute an alcoholic? One that doesn't stop drinking or one that doesn't stop drinking till their pi$*ed drunk and destroying other peoples lives? Hmmm.....        &nbsp;    When would it stop or slow down for me? When my knee cap hurts from the alcohol and lack of food in me. *thinks for a while* Nah... I'll&nbsp;still drink. In this loneliness that I'm in crazy things can happen or has already?        &nbsp;      In these eyes to her eyes I see      All you are and all you can be      Shattered like a crystal glass      With no hope to fill      All the aloneliness and despair        &nbsp;    In this life in this time I see      All you are and all you can be      Running from my love      Just cos you don't dare      To defy all those who won't care        &nbsp;      &nbsp;    Riff        &nbsp;      &nbsp;    Oh....      I love you oh can't you see      Dying every single day      Over & over x2      Again x3        &nbsp;    In these eyes&nbsp;I see      All you are and all you can be      Shattered like a crystal glass      With no hope to fill      Those loneliness caused in me        &nbsp;    Riff      Chorus        &nbsp;    .... ah can't you see I love thee.....      oh.. won't you fill my heart....      &nbsp;today        &nbsp;

        So very often we ask ourselves how much time should we put into our work *grins* and usually the reply is just clock out dude!!! But if we choose to do the lather, does that make u a workaholic? Hmmm... what would I be then? Pain in the a** who just have butt into everything?       &nbsp;   *sighs* The constant thing in my life would be that I can't leave things alone and that dad has made me independent *a tad too much* making DIY a second nature to me. With that a nickname sealed my fate as the DIY gal ... Doraemon. Hey Cat can I borrow ur hammer? Hey ya gonna grab ur tools. Sniff sniff my shoe tore can you fix it? No water lah... why ah? aaarrggh.....       &nbsp;   As my collegue would say you smeared sh*t onto yourself! (in cantonese)       &nbsp;   So here I am still stuck in the office with tonnes of things to do but none comes to mind and having to stay here till midnight doesn't help either. So blog and blog I go longgin fur sleep and dreaming of having a cold glass of Armagnac tonic to go. Salute!

        Sitting here with the worst soup ever made by man I ponder on life and the people that I know in my life. The successful, the rich, the know it all, the young and of course who wouldn't know any in their lives... the liars.       &nbsp;   Today I went to visit some freinds who have just lost their father, believe it or not my dad was their friend too. If there's one thing that I re-learned today is that results are mearly a reflection of what you are doing or what you've done though that doesn't mean that who you are!&nbsp;       &nbsp;   Still todays funeral was of such a wake up call. A family that use to be 5 held a modest chinese funeral and if there's one thing that stood out was that not many&nbsp;knew the poor guy! It was mostly friends of the children and none of us knew what to do! Didn't cry, didn't feel sad for them... nothing! Nothing at all that would be normal for a funeral at all! Not that we lost our father but there was no feeling for what the family was going through. What were the going through?       &nbsp;   Another lie.        &nbsp;   It came to me that I didn't know them at all and that what&nbsp;I knew of them were mostly lies that were put up by them. One mask after another. People (2 specificaly) who were looked at as people who anyone can rely on for an advice were suddenly two blanks! After all the layers of lies no one could connect to them cos there were nothing to connect to and thus the weird feeling of nothingness. How much can one lie you say?! A lot would be the answer. When you have a justification for all that is wrong in your life to make it ok that would make every posible thing in that persons life a lie.        &nbsp;    A slap it is that reminded me that a lie is a lie and when one lies to oneself the biggest of all lies has been commited.

        As I try to hold my head up I only end up beaten down with more work. Hungry, frustfrated (if I even typed a word) and grouchie I hope that a good homemade cuppucino will help the day go by.       &nbsp;   A another bomb drops, my GM outta the blue wanted to pancake my acting OM. Normally I would welcome it but this time round I decided he needed a fair chance to turn things over and talk about a lot of things to work out.       &nbsp;   The world has changed! Men do not neccesarrily know how to change or fix things. Kinda forgot that it ain't the states. What does that make me you say?! Doraemon I guess... *sigh*

        A crazy day it is after staring at my friend having her mom try to remove some anchovies bone that got stuck in her skin. Blurred and speachless I kept on wondering what to do and if my friend Sam with a sudden SOS was ok. Now that I can't call her I'm getting all worried for what? Dunno that whats sucks!       &nbsp;   What a day it was, somehow reality came knockin on the door that there was a bigger thing to do rather than the usual paper work. Marketing somehow popped into play as well as politics or rather a war game that will determine who stays or leaves. It has just begun. My small role in making more money and placing someone on the pedestal only to wait later for her to fall on her face. That ain't nice but that's the facts of life what goes on behind the sceans as well as the constant vicious cycle of people making lab rats of one another to get an answer. What happens to the mice then, who at the end of the day isn't the mice and who gets to end it all?       &nbsp;   God I guess... God

        The day for drunks like me never seem to end yet I constantly abuse myself with the silly stuffs like not eating in time and spendin loads of my time on line. Constatntly seaching still... dunno for what. I've always wonder how it is ppl fall for another on-line when there is virtually no way of knowing how the other looks like.. sure we can send pics but how often is it that is really them.        &nbsp;    Then brings the question why bother? Even a girl whom I met has a on-line girlfriend.. they are so tight knitted that I even sometimes find em cute.. least to say they are as sweet as the chocolates they make        Love is passion. Obsession. Someone you can't live without. Someone you fall head over heels for. Find someone you can love like crazy, and will love you the same way back. Listen to your heart. No sense in life without this. To make the journey without falling deeply in love, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try, because if you haven't tried, then you haven't lived.        tarasheart

        Ahhh! What a day for my very first, not to mention rushed blog. Truely many would ask why blog well after a short "sex in the city" I was reminded that it can be ane of the best way to share, let go or just plane vent the living daylights outta ourselves. What better way to start or end the day. For me it's smack right in the middle.       &nbsp;   What d'ya know. Constantly on some kind of alcohol, my job has left some amazed, in awe, in horror and even abhored? (whatever that means) So why is it that&nbsp; pple like me even consider this job? The money the fame or just the over rate romantic notion that we end up rich and looking good?! Is that even true? Hmm God knows...

        vrooommm.... vrrooommm..........!! Yeah man! There's nothing more exhilarating as being close to a harley davidson bike. What more if there were a whole row of them. oooOOooohhhh what a site.          *drools*          That's something that I would drool to. You would too. Down at Bangsar last night I experience what I would call as a breif experience of Rusia in a section they called the Russian Bar. It was cold, really cold so cold that if you didn't have enough body fat you had better have a bottle of vodka handy. Besides you can ougle at the bikes in style.

         The story continues!      So what happened to him? How did it come to be? It's not real!      Yeah! It was surreal indeed. He was a young man from a well of family that went through some tragic accident that left him and sister all alone. For sometime since I met him, I heard lil bout his sis other than what a bitch she can be for tell him what he need to do whether he wants to or not or even if it was right or not. It was bad. Eventhough it was understandable that a large corporation was about to be pass on to him, he was clear that he didn't want any part of it at all. Till this day I still don't know which.       He was very secretive of it as well as who his associations were besides the bikers. They freak me out! Who in the right mind wears black leather, white make up and black lipstick in a hot sweating country like Malaysia? They did! It's been so long that I don't even remember the bikers name. Black cult? Nah just a bunch of silly biker who like Marilyn Manson and ran out of ideas when it came to a club's image and dress code. Hey a bunch of IT geeks who happens to like bikes are rare and furthermore they were more of a kid than I was (even now). At the end of the day "Bulldog" (duh!!! not his real name) was the only guy I got to know besides him.      No secret there to why he was call "Bulldog". Short and balding, (or at least I thought he was) with a over built upper torso and legs and a really Poppy face, he is our close friend that had help us through the relationship. He most of all help my young love NS. Nope! Can't say his name or his sis might sue me for bug bucks I don't have. So every week NS and Bulldog and would meet up with me after they have dirty themselves in a race through the palm plantations. We would spend time sharing our day and our thoughts as well as his beautiful creations. A programmer, poet, song writer and artist, he was beyond any that even history has know. The only draw back was that he could not speak though his hearing was perfect. Many people have told me that it is impossible for one to not be able to talk and have normal hearing but there he was. Perfectly intune with music and our speech. Guess with that no one is perfect cos he still can't speak.          The long lazy afternoons that we would have in the plantations (till the owner chases us off that is), and the beautiful hand writing of his would put me in a different world, one without the bull that I had to put up at home. Like any other artistic man, he was always romantic even with childish things that we would do like hide and seek, him tugging on my hair and me poking on his sides he would always make the day a romantic one. It's kind of a blur now. It's been so long that what I remember of him are but pictures in my head and a void that I wonder if there could be any man that can fill it. In the crudest words, he has become my bench mark that will almost be impossible for anyone to reach. Cruel as it is for one to say, it is without doubt that without true love between me and who ever the future man maybe it will be impossible for any other man to fill those shoes. Any less would be a compromise and lets not lie about it, everyone including men has a sub-conscious bench mark on how their other half should be based on the one they've loved. So in order to break the silly charade one would have to be honestly in love to not be influenced by that bench mark. The next question is can we find a second true love or a third for that matter? Can we break this vicious cycle of ours and how long cn we pretend that I doesn't happen?        better to have loved than never?! Yeah! Other wise there will never be sweet without the bitter.

        what more can one ask for? Great sundays for us to stone out and do our own stuff, catch up with sleep and whatever it is that makes us happy. Some people consider that I'm easy to please just because of that statement. You have no idea how wrong they can be. As I look into life with an easy eye there is a part of me of great expectations and ideals where nothing is ever good enough till I say so.          When has that ever happened? Only in a brief moment in my life where the greatest person who has ever existed was taken away by god cos he's too good to be hanging around here and suffer. Tall and handsome with typical Chinese features, skin as beautiful as white peaches with flush pink cheeks, 6 packs and muscular arms and all. OooooOOohhh baby! Did ya get any of that hunk? Sadly no.          Loving each other so much that respect seemed to have had even greater value, so much that we even freaked when we tried, we scared ourselves silly that day. With every cell of our epidermis being alive, each touch brought us to a new high that only some who has been there would know. His perfect body, beautiful mind and soul would capture even the bitchest to the most stone cold hearted person in the world and make em come to life. So who is he you say? An angel who was never meant to be here on earth. There was so much to this man that it was almost impossible not to speak of him let alone to write about him. There is hope for love and the perfect love. Though brief, I must agree with Sunshine...                that is better to have loved than never at all              to be cont'd.

         There will always be someone in our lives that we'll call as our sunshine or look up to as the light of our lifes. So many interpretation to it but best put as 'hope'. Not that everyone has that kind of affect on one but the idea is more or less that same.          So.... my Sunshine. Who is she or he? She's the angel hiding in the devil's skin (she didn't like it when I said it during her birthday) filled with brut honesty only to those who would listen and have their lives be better, (why bother when they don't care and don't listen?) she untangles the what I once thought to be something small, right again.           Bored and tired of sex? Yeah man! Simply because there's no emotional feelings attached one way or another. Not that it can't be good but it can still get lonely and boring and of late I just found out that it is possible for a person to be well experienced and not realise that she was hardly satisfied. So what did she have? Sex? or Masturbation? o_O Beats me!           But yes, with gentle hands that holds mine, my Sunshine assures me that there was nothing wrong with me just that I was not into them men emotionally, with a smile she made the shame I felt into silliness and a hug of assurance that I was sane, not alone and loved. What else is there to ask for? eep! o.0 Better not!

        Aarrrggghhh....!!! Monday mornings! Wish it never came! The typical reaction of a modern man but for me every morning is a Monday morning so long as I have to wake up to work and like any sad, disturbing life story I woke up late this morning with the scent of a man that I've shared my night with.          His scent lingered till now, tired, unsatisfied and mixed with the burnin' sensation on my skin with the alcohol seeping outta me I struggle to focus on work. Am I horny? Hmmm.... funny thing.... I'm not!          Is it the lack of sleep or the alcohol that's making a new cocktail in me that is changing the sex addict that I am remains a mystery. Then again who am I kidding, I'm tired of men, having them like the way I do is like having chocolates as and when I want to and I'm starting to get tired of it. Hey I'm no Samantha Jones! I had better stop to at least start to enjoy it again or I might turn 100% lesbian which isn't all bad. With all that's said it has certainly been an ugly morning.

        Most of the time, irritating circumstances or anoying situations are very often caused by lil things. Like your car's glove compartment that pops open everytime you drive over a bump, my hair when it decides to live life on it's own or your bloody restaurant that has almost everyone smoking but almost none with a lighter! HOw dumb and anoying can that be?! VERY!!!!          Now Incharge of beverage and tobacco I'm constantly bugged with questions like why don't you sell cohiba cigars, why don't you have Cartier? Worst of all don't you have matches or lighters? Aaaarrrgghhh.....!!!!          It stings when your BOSS happens to be the one asking you that. So now stoned in a room filled with the vapour of lighter fluid I ask myself why do I put up with this shit and not just take the short cut and slove it? Ego trip!!! lazy, got too much in hand to do than to fix this first... yup our every day excuses.           Do you see yours?

         It's a wonder what a hair cut can do for a person... true enough without a doubt when one feels good about themselves the rest rolls along. My friend said that I look happy like I was having an infatuation. LOL it was so funny that I asked her again of what she said just to hear it again.. lame.....!! But ya gotta admit, it makes you wonder doesn't it of how I looked to have made her said that.          Well a weekend of convocation, girlfriend vs boyfriend brawl, ATM F*ck Ups, hair cuts and lots of JD, I gotta admit that I miss it all and it is the thing that keeps me moving everytime I fall. Well the fastest way keep fit and burn liver and brain cells all in one go. Is worth it? Let me tell ya.. it is Missy Elliot!! It is!

         With a unbelievable headache and empty stomach I run around hoping to be able to stay afloat in this ocean of work of mine. Even typing the word 'WORK' has become a task for me. Half in dreamland and reality I tasted my beer as though it was wine only to be stared at by my staff as if I have lost my mind.          Never mind, the day is young and I look forward to tonight's partying and later the hair cut that will liberate me from this constant misery.           Hoegarden here I come!

        It is not enough that I don't have enough sleep, as anticipated my collegue quickly found it amusing and some even applauded my new hair do (my nightmare has begun). The girly school girl look made people turn heads and make comments. Good and bad it is still not my "rocker I don't care look" that reflects me.          Uuugghhhh.....!!!!!!

        Hair cuts. How bad can they be? Yup that phase again that we so often use and regret. Regret I did.          After months of not having a hair cut I finally lost all patients and had it hacked off. With a punk rocker vision in my head I was ready to have my hair short again that was until the hairstylist froze at my request. Fearing that he may not be able to cope with cutting 10 inches of my hair off, I decided that 6 inches was not too bad... yeah right..          The vision of a rocker look colapsed as if a bomb has gone up in a building. Now with a sweet innocent look, I run and hope that I can somehow change it to the rockers style and soon too. This is by far a young adults nightmare. Can you say young virgin? arrgggh!!!          This is without a doubt a reminder that I should have more patience to wait for my friend Sue to cut my hair. She would now maybe laugh at the look I have now. Ain't I nice to pick on now?!

          Karyn...           Just a girl who had just finish one of her most outrageous experiences at Pie Me Up. Lead by a guy of integrity and insanely full of BS, she survives with a new nick name "Mummy" and known as Stephen's crush aka last chance at getting a girl.           A 19 year old girl that has the power to turn heads and make them take note of her is totally insane. She definately has my attention! Looking at her I still to this very day try to identify what it was I saw in her that was so familiar and so did she. She even mentioned that we may have seen each other somewhere... but where? Deja vu? Hai... I gotta get me a girl or at least one who I can talk to.          Even now as I think of someone else the idea that the someone else who can't even have sms sex with me is nuts especially when that person doesn't know what a cock or a dick is. How would what we have constitute as sms sex? This is by far worst than faking it while really doing it...!          So the girl named Karyn has taken our hearts and kept it real so real that her presence sends us into a high only we can know. So Stephen there goes your bride...

        With work constantly tearing me into pieces, it doesn't help any more or better when life comes in as well. Being flexible has given me lots of headache, mostly because everyone expects me to be the one to solve the prob even has the balls to say that they didn't.          So it's friend's birthday verses big fat juicy customers. Gotta iron this out before I loose my life.
