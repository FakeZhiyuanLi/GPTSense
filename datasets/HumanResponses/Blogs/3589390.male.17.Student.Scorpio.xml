      Today was long...very long. I woke up around 8:30 and decided that because it was supposed to be a nice day, I'd walk/ride my board to work. Well I realized it was raining and all crappy outside too late for me to catch the bus, so I was forced to walk. It took forever, or atleast what seemed like it. Raining the whole time, figuring I was going to be late if I didn't hurry, I put my board down and started bombing some hills on this pretty busy road...it probably didn't help that I was riding on the other side, but I lived. So anyways, I get to work and all is fine except one thing got me a bit angry, and that was...my coworker Josh got into an accident a few weeks ago and totaled his car, well two of the managers were talking to him about the whole ordeal, standing in plain view of potential customers. I was in the back, washing a cup when my one manager comes to me and says, "Uh..Ian, you have a customer." WELL THANKS. As if the other kid who was standing there looking the customer into their eyes couldn't have helped them...whatever. So anyways, the one lady was scheduled to leave around 2:30 but she didn't "feel well"...shucks, so she left around 12:30. Then comes around 1:00 and I knew business was going to pick up, but my other coworker asked if he could go home, and she allowed him to. RIGHT after he left, it got packed, I was running around for an hour and a half straight, helping lines of people that I shouldn't have had to. If I got the help I was supposed to have, everyone of those people would've been out in a few minutes, but no. So that was quite annoying but, once again I survived. When the time to go home came around, I grabbed my stuff, went outside and decided to just skate home. So, I skated down Peach St., with the crazy drivers at my back, probably hoping for me to slip and have my head run over, but, again I survived. I made it all the way to JS Wilson, when a couple kids I goto school with offered me a ride, saying that they were going to his girlfriend's house, who lives right near me, so I humbly accepted the offer. They then told me that they left the theater the same time I did, in which I was amazed I got pretty close to my house so fast but...yeah, whatever.  So I get home, shower...relax and then when my sister's friends came over I agreed to watch Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with them. I laid down on the couch and in no time I was asleep. I was woken up to be told I had a call from Vonda and she talked to me about doing something this evening, but because I so tired and don't even really remember what was said, I think she told me that we'd just cancel plans up to 9:00, when we'd go up and see Fahrenheit 9/11. So she called me a few hours later to wake me up and tell me she was coming...She picked me up, we went up to Tinseltown and, much to my dismay we were forced to buy tickets to the movie because it was selling too well. Oh well...Anyways, the documentary/movie was done VERY well and I enjoyed it much more than his previous 'Bowling for Columbine', because it was more fact based, than just his opinions. After the movie we went and just talked to a few fellow Tinseltown-ers and just hung out for a bit..then we came home. And..I'm hungry, so I'm going to go...yeah.

      Just remembered...  While I was closing at work tonight, a manager asked across the walkie, what year JFK was killed. I didn't hear it at first, but later another manager replied with, "He was shot and killed in 1964, and then Lyndon B. Johnson took over the presidency." So there I am, wondering if I should point out the huge flaw in my manager's comment...well I did, so I replied with, "I'm nearly positive that JFK was killed on November 22, 1963." There I am, even giving them the day, heck I could've given them the city, time...blah blah blah. Well the [incorrect] manager replied, "Well, I just talked to my mother, who majored in history in college, so I thinks she's right." Hah, whatever, your mother is a fool is more like it. Then some random employee replied, "Oooh, you calling his mom a liar?" Anyways, I just remembered all of this, went to wikipedia.com and found out that JFK was indeed killed November 22, 1963, I printed the page out and wrote in black sharpie on the bottom, "Yes, your mother's a liar."  I'll leave it unsigned. :D

      Haven't updated in awhile. Oh well, no one reads this anyways.  Er...instead of utilizing the blessing of public transportation, I decided to save myself $1.10 and just skate to work. It only took 35 minutes or so, but I was a bit warm and my hair was messed up pretty badly. Today I was supposed to train some kid from concession, but I only saw him for about 10 seconds and then he supposedly went home sick. Oh well. The evening went smoothly, even thought I'd get out of their pretty quickly...well I was wrong. While I was locking everything up, there was one lock that...just wouldn't lock. It took me 20 minutes to get it, and I'm still doubtful it was completely locked. I forgot something of mine I left in the fridge...er..what else, I had to run around like a madman for the last half hour, sweating my brains out, giving myself a horrible headache, just to get out at a reasonable time. AGh. I know I'm overreacting, but I'm allowed. Whatever.  I'm dead.

      Today...hm.  Well after passing out while watching Braveheart last night, I decided to watch a few more of my new DVD's...I watched K-PAX again. Wow, better than the first time. Kevin Spacey is by far the best actor ever, and if you don't agree, you're wrong...plain and simple. :)  After watching K-PAX I went to my baseball game and well..there were 13 of us there. THIRTEEN. That means...PEOPLE SIT OUT. Now see, I'm all for having enough people on a team, not to screw people over who really do want to play, but after all is said and done, we have a team of sixteen people. SIXTEEN. Luckily some obviously didn't show up tonight, but that's beside the point. Recently my imbecile of a coach decided to "recruit" two new kids...half-way through the season. What a joke...I mean, they're good ball players, but that just means more people have to sit out..So anyways, today I led off, centerfield, first to bat..grounded out, after I accidentally stumbled out of the batter's box..egh. Then next time I got up, I hit a line drive right at the pitcher. Shucks. Well, my batting wasn't very good so now a look at my fielding..first inning a kid hits a ball to right field, I'm running assuming I'm going to back the right fielder up because, he's partly incompetent...but he decides to tell me to get it, so here I am, completely in right field, having to slide to make a catch...well I miss it, and I get chewed out for it. Whatever. Anyways, before I was taken out, coach put me in right field for one inning, because one of the new kids "doesn't play" right field. What a joke! He's been here 2 games and he's getting his preference heard over someone who's been there for 3 years? My coach is an idiot..but I go out to right field and make 2 out of the 3 outs, some nice popup catches...but he still takes me out.  ANYWAYS...later in the game while I was on the bench, the other new kid says something along the lines of, that if you're up to bat and have the bat over the plate showing a bunt, and you don't pull back, it's automatically a strike. I told him that he was wrong, and that you're allowed to have your bat over the plate and if it's a bad pitch, it's still called a ball because to be considered a bunt, you have to "go for" the ball. He said he was 100% sure he was right and even said he'd be willing to put money on it. He then proceded to call me stupid for thinking otherwise. Well, I was bored a few minutes ago and looked it up online. Guess who was right? Me.  Whatever..then I just got done watching Memento again..good movie.  uh..I'm tired.    eeefkq2opw3utpq2

      Well, I had work again today at 10 and...I got on the right bus! Yes! I got dropped off near the mall and just was going to walk up to work, but I had a bunch of time to kill, so I stopped at Wegman's, got some donuts and a milk chug and was going to go up to Panera's to just sit down and waste time..so I get up to Panera's, put my skateboard in the booth along with my work stuff and food and goto the bathroom to wash-up. I come back, sit down and open up my milk and..then Eva Braun comes to my table and tells me, "I'm sorry, you can't sit here and eat food, unless you buy it from here." Uh..good one lady. I just wanted to say, "Hey Eva, there are about 10 people in here, including your [hot] employees, so it's not like I'm taking anyone's booth." Gesh..people are so lame. I should've gone up to the register and just asked for the cheapest thing, or else just told the lady I was going to eat my donuts and drink my milk, and then buy a sandwhich for lunch, then just..left. Oh well, I just got to work REALLY early and just sat outside and ate because the doors were locked. Eh.  So, work was super busy...or not. After 6 hours of work, I sold only 11 drinks. ELEVEN. It was weak, I barely had any customers, I almost went crazy. But I just made stuff and bounced some bouncy balls around. Anyways, I'm bored, tired and...want to sleep, so I'll go.  Er. Yeah.

      Let's see...today I had church, church again, then some time to hang out afterwards and then I went to a graduation party. I stayed a bit, talked to a few people I worked with, it was nice..good food too! Afterwards Valerie and I went driving around town, went down to the south pier and just walked around and talked about pushing people in the water, haha...hm..good time. Anyways, not much else going on, I have work tomorrow 10a-4p so that'll take a bit of my morning up, hopefully this time I'll catch the right bus, eh? Well I'm out..I'm thirsty..

      So my internet has been down for a few days and thanks to Tabitha of Adelphia, it is now working again...so let's see what has been going on..  Firstly, a couple days ago I had some birthday party I went to for Norbert and Derek at Evan's Skateland. Oh boy was that interesting...I got my disco pants, a whit shirt and some "bling" and tore it up skating...hah yeah, sure. No, it was awesome though, I made Derek and Norbert their cards because I had no time to go out and buy them some, and then shoved a check in each of their cards for $15.28 each just so I wouldn't have that extra $0.56 laying around in my checking account. ::shrug:: I'm weird, oh well..  Yesterday... Well I woke up extra earlier for work (which started at 10) because I was going to have to catch a bus up to the mall because nobody was home...So...I do so, get to the bus stop around 8:40 and wait 'til 8:48 which (it was right in the correct 8:45-8:50 range I was told and even was on the right route) and got on...Did I mention it was heading northbound instead of southbound which is what I thought I needed to get on? Eh, regardless we were going and I thought we were just going to swing around on to Peach St. but...no. After a half hour, we're down at the Blasco Library, me..running out of time because I still needed to walk to work from the Mall and well, things weren't looking too great. After having to pick up some elderly people and a handicapped kid, time was running out even quicker and so at around 9:46 I got off the bus at the EXACT same spot I got on at with only 14 minutes to get to work. I run home wake my sister up and tell her I'm taking the car even though I only have my permit..oh well! I end up leaving the house around 9:51 and get up to Tinseltown, clock in (before my co-workers) with 3 minutes to spare. I was so relieved. So I call my sister and tell her what happened and she tells me not to tell my mom because she may kill me so...yeah. I called my brother who lives relatively close to us and asked him to meet me at the house around 12:45. So around 12:30 I left work for my break, met my brother at the house and got a ride back with him to work.. When I got my ride home from work at 4 I was wondering if I should tell my mom so...I do because I didn't think she'd be angry..well. I was right she wasn't angry about me taking the car, but rather about me getting the wrong bus after she "specifically" told me which one to take..sure. Oh well, it was all interesting, like a stupid little one episode sitcom. Anyways, that night I ended up going back out to Tinseltown and saw Stepford Wives with Vonda, and ended up seeing a few others up there..It was, eh..alright, nothing spectacular, and incredibly predictable. Oh well..  Uh...yeah. BYE.

      Well, let's see...my first "actual" post rather than just my test post..  Nothing extremely interesting happened today, had a baseball game but we didn't have enough people, so we recruited one of my teammate's sister to play..oh boy. I'll give it to her, she had some fortitude coming out to play with us and she wasn't half bad. I had to creep into right field a lot to help her out, thus leaving a huge gap where I normally play so, that presented a huge problem. Anyways, they killed us...I went 1-1 with a single into left field..I only got up twice, but the first time the umpire said the ball hit me so..I didn't argue with him. :P  Hm..well I'm tired. I may watch one of my new DVD's tonight, possibly American History X or Memento..both amazing films..okay time to go. I know, this was a complete waste of your time so...too bad, it's all your fault for thinking it'd be interesting. :)

      Anyways I've been here in NJ for a few days now and just thought to update...As I mentioned, my grandma recently passed away and the wake was on Monday and then the funeral was yesterday...everything went well and was very nice...    Erm..yeah.    I'll be down here in NJ 'til about August 15th so..yeah...not as if many of you cared...well..nobody reads this so..yeah.    ..yeah.

      So..I woke up around 7:10 when I should've been up by 6:45..so I had to hurry to get ready to go pick up Norbert at 7:40 and goto Derek's for...zee Warped Tour.  We picked up Tony at 8:05 when Derek said we'd get him at 8:30...and he woke up right when we got there so...yeah. Anyways, we stopped at Burger King so they could grab some food and..we were off to Cleveland! Anyways, the concert was great, I saw a lot of bands I've been wanting to see live for quite some time..Only thing that annoyed me was..      1) Someone threw an open and full (but plastic) beer bottle and it hit me in the back of the head, pouring beer all over the back of my head.      2)  As Coheed &amp; Cambria were finishing their set, I was ducking because a crowd surfer landed on top of me and right as they passed the drummer threw his sticks into the crowd. Well, of course he had to throw them at the only person NOT looking up, so they both hit me in the head and..it hurt.      3) As Bad Religion started their set, a girl next to me in the front row was trying to get out by jumping over the barrier with help of the peacekeeper...Well, behind us was some stupid (probably a drunk Nazi) pushing everyone to get closer. I turned to him and said, "She's just trying to get out." And of course that's the most rude and offensive thing anyone could've said, so he responded with, "I'll fuck you up!" I looked at him and just said, "Whatever.." So when I turned around he punched me in the back of the head. Funny thing was that it didn't hurt at all, so I turned around and looked at him again and said, "You've got to be joking me!" Then I just rolled my eyes at him and turned around again...so he punched me two more times...it was pretty funny because he looked like he could break someone, but he couldn't even punch me hard enough to hurt..      So yeah, yesterday was intense..I was so happy to see Bad Religion, Alkaline Trio and Flogging Molly...oh, and of course the Casualties! Today I have small abrasions on my back and my ribs hurt from being pushed into the metal bar in the front row...oh well. Good day.      Anyways, Derek dropped me off first, I walk the stairs and first thing my mom says was, "Ian, nanny died about an hour and a half ago." Freaking great...awesome day, then that news. She was obviously sad and crying so I comforted her for a half hour or so and then did my thang...ie. bathe.      It's alright that she's not with us though, in fact she's been in pain for quite some time and it was better for her just to go, especially in the presence of so many people that cared for her. I loved her so much, what a great lady...she was truly blessed, and we were truly blessed to have her. I know she's now with her family that preceded her in death so, everything is alright. Thanks for everyone who's shown concern and/or offered your prayers...thanks.         Rest in peace grandma, you're safe now.

      Well, I just got home from my baseball game and...hm..We won about 30 to 5..yeah we rule. They made the worst errors ever and frankly it was disgraceful to the game. Of course my fascist coach only let me play half the game and let his favorites play more..oh well, I'll just have to kill him.

      Hm..the format of this..composition looks different. OH well.      Anyways, today after a long, extended absence of a few days from work,  I opened...and worked with this super awesome girl. She was extremely  polite, enthusiastic, smart, funny...pretty weird too, hm.. Anywho, I  thought we hit it off pretty well, but boys are fools, eh? I was  contemplating earlier about asking her out sometime, just to see a  movie, something free and simple right? I'm just not totally sure  though, she lives a bit far away, for someone who I don't think  drives...so it may be much asking her to get out to the theater,  hm..also we just met, so I'm not sure. It's just we won't be working  much together and I figured I might as well..who knows?      But yeah...that was today. La-la-la.

      A good friend of mine (Vonda) was in a car accident yesterday on her way to work, a guy swerved into her lane, hitting her head on...:( She has a fractured pelvis, broken ribs and a punctured lung..blah, it was hard seeing her in the hospital today. I just hope she gets better as fast as possible, she'll be missing out on college and..that sucks. Please keep her in your prayers or..thoughts, whatever your preference is, I know she'll appreciate it.  Anyways...yeah.

      I thought the "Achtung!" post would be my last, but I'm bored so...here I go.  A couple weeks ago, right before the July 4th weekend, my mom, sister, (doggy) and I all went to New Jersey to visit with family and for my mom to spend time with my grandma who's in this "Convalescent" home aka rehab center but, euphemisms will fool anyone, right? So my mom would spend 12 hour days with her for the week we were there and, it was hard on the whole family. My sister, cousins and I were left home by ourselves all day so we had to fend for ourselves and...do nothing. :) Anyways, the trip was too short and we had to come back...so yeah.  Then...er I did nothing except play baseball, sleep, and work for the past few weeks..  Hm..this morning I woke up around 7:15, wondered why my parents weren't up for church, but...whatever, fine with me. I lay there...trying to sleep, but nothing...So I just lay, lay, lay and then eventually I fell asleep, only to be woken up by my mom at 9:33...yes, 9:33. She hands me the phone, I say hello and well, it's my baseball coach..   "Ian, are you planning on coming to the game?!"  "No, I told you last week I wouldn't be able to."  "When I asked who couldn't make it, I didn't see your hand raised, that's why I said 7 guys could make it."  "Sorry, I said on a few occasions I wouldn't be able to make it, not just last game."  "Well this puts me in a jam, we need guys...what are you doing anyways?"  "I'm going to church."  "Can't you uh..go another time?!"  "No."  "We need you."  "Sorry, I can't come."  "FINE, bye."   So he was a bit ticked I couldn't come, even though I told him at the past 3 games I wouldn't be able to make it. Yeah, sucks for my team, but it's not my fault he can't count. I tried to be as polite as possible, but not let myself be suckered into changing my mind just to please people, and I didn't so that's good...besides, he's probably one of the last guys I would do a favor for...I can't stand him as a coach...  OH WELL. Church was fun...It was  Bring Your Neighbor Day  so there were a bunch of new faces which is nice...afterwards I was skeptical about staying but I was cajoled into doing so with the teasing of...free food. So I stayed, hung out with my ex's little brother and his friend, and then another girl who goes there...I had a good time though, it was worth staying for. Anyways, I left at about 1:00 and then by about 1:23..yes, 1:23 I got home. (I'm pretty precise with time..sorry).. So I got home in 23 minutes and traveled about 3 miles on my skateboard...that's pretty good time. But yeah, now I'm just talking to some people online, playing with my deck of cards and...writing in this stupid thing. :D  But I'm going to go.  SO BYE.
