      my family left on long island is kevin, desiree and john. dez and john the guido may not be blood, but they are just as much a part of me. i feel like my time with them was too short this weekend... desiree was really sick. john, kevin and i went out to montego bay saturday nite and partied late-nite on john's couch which kicked my ass. aside from that, i slept. desiree had a panick attack and was having a lot of trouble breathing so we had to take her to the hospital. she's fine, thankfully, but i spent my last nite 'with them' at the bar with james beach. beach is hysterical but i am wishing they were able to hang out, too. we spent our whole time at the bar trying to figure out how to get the touch-screen photo hunt game to show us naked girls. it never worked!  kevin and i drove into the city today to check me into my hotel, since i have to work the rest of the week. i'm sad he's gone :(.  happy memorial day. it's pouring and everyone's locked themselves in their apartments. i was looking for a fun bar to kick back in with kevin and we hit duke's - of course we did - bc it's still my favorite bar in ny. totally laid-back. old-skool paraphinalia on the walls (like a dukes of hazzard eating tray and a hawaiian punch phone). from there we went to some little latino restaurant and got soaked walking around. kevin went home to take care of dez and - like a fat kid and cake - i magically appeared at the doors of h&m. shopped a bit but nothing impressed me too much. nothing impressed me and i still dropped like $200. typical!  so i'm sitting here in my hotel.  urlLink le marquis  is the name of it. it's fine but i'm hungry and it's 10pm and too late for me to go hunt down food. i'm wondering how it's possible that i grew up here and always had a lot of friends, but i only have a small handful i'd consider calling right now. and since i'll be here 4 more days i'm thinking - why bother? i don't feel lonely, instead i feel a bit disappointed in my enthusiasm to 'catch up' with old friends. i have dinners set up with a few people i am excited to see this week - but is it awful that i am chatting with my laptop instead of breathing people? if you're reading this blog you are just as guilty as i am! it's just addictive dammit.

      i'm in new yawk. spent this weekend on long island... "home."  the term home is ironic bc i couldn't feel more disconnected from it than i do. i've been gone 4 years. it's a full-on culture shock for me. maybe because there's so much 'family life'. in sf i don't have friends with kids or family in town. most people roots are elsewhere. but on long island, it seems like no one ever leaves... extended families are everywhere and totally common. you go to the store - which is always in a strip mall - and there are caravans and kids in baseball uniforms and teenagers who all look exactly the same. where is the culture??? it freaks me out!  speaking of family life.. i met baby nicholas aliani :). michele and chris aliani's 2 month old baby. he's beautiful! michele is my first close friend to have a baby so it's freaky but wonderful! he's a 'fat fuck' as his dad would say. i surprised michele. her sister-in-law corissa brought me over and i went into the bathroom while michele was showering and scared the shit out of her. she opened the shower door and hugged me and all i could see was how big her boobs were! damn! they were big before but now... it's just hysterical. she looks great, the house is dreamy, i'm feeling very happy for that family.

      i like bubbles before they burst. they're all colorful and trippy and floaty and weightless. i actually secretly like the burst, but in the context of the bubble i'm using - geez i already lost a job from a burst, and i can say confidently - i don't like that kind of burst!  but the internet bubble is starting to get a good wind blown into it again, and i like it. this week was @tech in sf, an internet advertising conference from god. there was a great turnout - hundreds of people. hundreds of damn good looking people actually ;). and most in their late 20s- early 40s. my type of conference.  aside from the totally interesting companies taking part there were some of the old-skool internet parties in effect. i'm wondering if it threw any of the 'hot' companies into bankruptcy. monday cocktails following the conference. open bar. hello! following the cocktail hour i stopped in to a client's office, where they were having their own party. good people, good food, good beer, good conversation. from there we headed to suade, a club in north beach. not my flavor but if nothing else - exciting to see so many people going out to party on internet money. the place was like a frat party. doods who are on a business trip and haven't gone 'clubbing' in years. a bit scary. some fire dancers and a decent dj, so i found a little home between them. turned out - for me - being too many people who were sweating too much and trying to teach me how to salsa dance. i think it would have helped if i did a few shots of tequilla before i got there. but instead i rested for the same thing, following day.  conference. drinks at chris'. tried to get into a sassy party at $250 a head for free. denied. me and the boys (chris, alex, nick, can't remember other guys name..) headed over to ruby skye. dj donovan and belly dancers on platforms with fishnets. sweet. they had a little trapese show which was pretty cool, but i had to stand on furniture to even see. not really my style. good little nite... met some cool people in from out of town, spent quality time with the boys, got some dancing in, and managed to duck most of the annoying flirting horny business doods. all in all it left a smile on my face. still smiling. thinking naughty thoughts...   urlLink    chris, me & alex&nbsp; urlLink

      amy l-p came to visit from ny and destroyed me! well, being sick i was half dead anyway, she just helped me to kick into death mode. well worth it tho :)  picked up amy on wednesday nite at 1am from oakland airport and we went to my house and chatted away, catching up about everyday drama that's not so fun to talk about over the phone. i took thursday and friday off. thursday around 2 we decided to head up to sonoma for some wine tasting. i bought a digital camera on the way up (more on that - i love it!) and stopped and sipped it up at viansa, clive (cline?) and... um... i can't remember the other. thursday nite we stayed in and flourished in the chatter. friday was spent mostly on the couch. i felt like shit! around 4 we headed into union sq and met up with alex and ana for sangria at thirsty bear.  mmmm!   urlLink    me & amy&nbsp; urlLink     then we headed to mighty for a party goldie and laird were throwing. after getting hit on too many times we bailed and hit an M3 party in a space on capp and 17th st. i remember going to that same space for a party like 3 years ago... it's a cool space, open, 2 floors, 4 rooms, live art. we danced our asses off there till dawn and slept most of saturday away.  saturday i couldn't sleep enough. we woke up, ordered in lunch, and went back to bed. got back up, went to moki sushi. made a green stop at patricks where we were pleasantly surprised by the arrival of the boys (chris, alex). watched the kfog kaboom from the deck and then went to the airport. i was very sad to see amy go... :(. love that girl. luckily i will be seeing her next week in NY!  sunday i woke up and went to play in the woods by myself. one of my very favorite things to do! i drove up to mt tam and hiked a VERY little bit. i intended to do a full-on hike but was enjoying trucking around the mountain and listening to music, so i made a few stops and played with the numerous settings on my new digicamera. LOVE IT. then i dropped down the side of the mountain and rolled around the hills on the cliff of the ocean down to stinson beach. there were tons of people out and in the water. i laid out for an hour and people watched. there is such a warm fuzzy feeling i get watching little kids play in the sand and jump the waves that are crashing ashore. the innocence and playfulness is so awesome. i got back in the jeep and trucked around a little bit more before heading into my favorite concrete jungle, sf.   urlLink    top of mt tam&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    stinson beach&nbsp; urlLink

      everybody tells me you pay for what you get...  my payment is an upper respiratory infection. more specifically, 'discharge' in the back of my throat. a dry cough and - oh look, a new surprise - a bloody nose. ick.  what did i get for it? well...   - one night of dancing hard at mighty to some pretty funky djs. too many red bull/cranberry/vodkas and screaming at alex and jamie so they can hear me over the speakers we were dancing in front of. highlight: charlotte the baroness. i really dug her set. galen rocked my world too. my most favorite part was having jamie there to lift me away into a special little world of cryptic statements and giggles. she just does that to me, time and time again!   - one saturday baseball game at not-pac-bell-park-anymore SBC park.  unfortunately this cold thing was kicking in pretty strong so i was pretty tired and quiet. but what i've found is people-watching at baseball games can be funner than being 'on.' it's pretty amusing, actually. there's this whole world in that little stadium. there are all these rituals and chants. very cultish when you notice. reminds me of how much i miss my daddy.  - one bloody mary at hobsins choice on haight street eyeing the costumed drunken clowns who just 'ran' bay-to-breakers. the headcold led me astray, however. the crowded bar full of people singing journey songs at the top of their lungs gave me a bit of claustrophobia.  - one awesome sunset party. the suspects: me, jamie, her friend sean (or you can call him john), amy j, checkoway. the music: groovy house. the setting: jetty on the bay, windy but sunny day, china/india basin, back and forth from the red blanket to the dance floor to the liquor store to kfc (blah) to the pee bush.   - one silly afterparty at my house, hosted by rustycat.  not bad! another beautiful, unique san francisco weekend. someone said that bay to breakers made them fall in love with san francisco all over again this weekend. i'd have to agree, but i'm inclined to say the sunset party may have done it more for me. i love nothing as much as dancing under the sun, overlooking the bay and the hills on one side and the concrete jungle on the other. fun friends, titilating troublemakers. what more do you need?  the energy of the weekend came to a screaching halt today when i saw the doctor about this cold issue. after discussing some other health issues i've noticed she decided to have my chest xrayed and ordered blood tests for next week. for the first time in my life the possibility of the big C entered. cancer. lymphoma. it's weird to even type it. i believe these tests are a precaution and my doctors way of proving it's all ok. i am not symptomatic with the exception of night sweats. which are the reason we're testing in the first place - they suck. but all of a sudden i realize... i am so lucky. i have so much. i even feel today that i am a good person and i am proud of who i am and what i offer this world.  enough of that. i'm sure it's nothing. if anything, it's an opportunity to really think about what's important and who i want to be. the things i want to accomplish. i want to be giving.  right now it's rest time, though.  amy l is visiting from ny this weekend. i'm taking thursday and friday off.  woo hoo! 2 more days and the work week is OVER!  yayy!

      here's my first shot at a blog. man i feel techy today. is google taking over the world or what? it's fine with me, i'm digging the gmail so i thought i'd give the blogger a fair shot. i haven't posted one of these before, because realistically i don't know how much (more) of my thoughts need to be made so public. i mean, i like to think there's a beautiful bond created between me and the goddesses and gentlemen in my life, that is sparked by my personal attachment and confidence in telling them my deep thoughts and embarassing moments. if i just put it all out there... for all y'all to digest... does that begin to chip away at those bonds?  oh who the hell knows! today is tuesday. i am procrastinating at work. shhh. i am still recovering from sunday - sloshball in golden gate park. sloshball = kickball not-so-5th-grade-styyle.  meaning, when you're up: you're drinking a beer. when you're in the outfield: you're drinking a beer. when you're on second: you're drinking a beer. you get the picture. as if the physical part mixed with the drinking wasn't enough to beat me to the ground, some little puerto rican girl did her part of making sure the ground and i became closely acquainted. we're talking total girl fight. she tackled me on the pitchers mound, i body slammed her ass!!!  :)   and today i feel old and achy. and i still keep giggling at all the sights and sounds from the game. great day for it - beautiful san francisco spring day, sun shining brightly, gentle breeze, 20 great, warm people spreading the love... couldn't ask for more.  k back to work.

      so is the single life, that one girlfriend sends me this (below) and another tells me they read an article that single women should have more than one man in their life, as this ongoing dating thing. it's good for you, she says. in a conversation with a male coworker he says the same thing. is it good for you? is it good for me?  Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) On the 19th, Mercury, the smartest planet in the solar system, will light up your eighth house of sex and mystery. For the last ten days of the month, explore your sexual fantasies and spread largesse in all directions. If you're single, you might want to remember that sleeping with more than one person a week is nothing to be ashamed of, but not showering between trysts is.  ((side note: i had to look up largesse. the defintion is:)) ((Liberality in bestowing gifts, especially in a lofty or condescending manner.))  ((Money or gifts bestowed.)) ((Generosity of spirit or attitude.))   interesting.. so does this mean that the presence of multiple men lessens the risk and expectation, and so it's better? that's what i'm taking away from the theory. that's so a suzi take-away and i'm fine with that. that's what i'm thinking is the 'good for you' part. i'd consider it more the 'better for you' though. better than focusing on one person. better than not focusing on you (err, on me) when that's what's good for you (ok, me.). i like the idea of spreading generosity of spirit or attitiude but the condescending manner part is not necessary, is it?  i haven't been single in a long time. i've looked at single life for the past few years like, ok girl why are you focusing all your energy on this one boy? you are amazing just being you. and i always thought that a strong woman can overcome any boy doubts by saying - hey, i was great before i knew him and if he happened to disappear i will still be fabulous. it just seems so easy and grounded. and i still hold true to that thought. we all need love. it is divine. but no guy is going to fulfill those desires and needs, and no ANYONE is. girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever. somewhere inside it's up to you and you need to find your fulfillments in the ways that satisfy you. and balance those fulfillments. that is the key. the balance. and the focus on what satifies those needs and desires.

      keepin it short. sunset party, novato. stafford lake. couple hundread very creative and happy partiers, rockin out by the lake in the midst of these rolling greeen hills. upon a crystal blue lake. nature everywhere yet VERY urban funksters with their unique and fabulous costumes. red polka dot ladies and french guys in poyester white tux's with glued-on hitler 'stache's. speaking some dirty french to me - which i ask for and love it for it's ohhh we sound, while i watch guys in spikes and shaved bald heads and play frisbee. i dance with a 9-yr old whose 2 uncles are the djs and when she's 15 she hopes to play this party, righton. there are toddlers bottomless being super cute running around with their butts all out there and all us freaks loving how cute and stressless that is. there are some rad breakdancers. i love thhem and the party because they do their thing, and it's AMAZIN, but so many other people are funkin out and dancing that there's not this dancefloor digging on the breakdancer in the middle. instead, we watch him out of the corner of our eye, and we dig him. and it makes us smile and dance harder.

      a good and uneventful week. finally! i went to see the killers perform at virgin records thursday with big b. it was their cd release party for their new album, big fuss. i saw them a couple months ago at the great american when they were touring with stellastarr* and that show was way better. this one was 1) in a store in union sq at 6pm on a thursday and 2) full of kids. some of them very cool sporting punk/80s garb. i enjoy scoping their decor. i have such a curiousity about people's fashion expressions. then there were the 2 big, annoying as all hell asian guys in front of me that were dancing with these large, dramatic moves that reminded me of new-wave circa '88 and the thing i don't get - is i don't think they were alive to see that. i barely remember it. yet they've reinvented that and brought it back. i'd be more interested in people watching them if they didn't piss me off so much. one guy was dancing and jumping around so much i couldn't see the band and couldn't help but to see him being such an ass. the other did whatever the first guy did. which annoyed me more.   urlLink    mr flowers&nbsp; urlLink      but the killers were good. they were killer. ha. they seemed pissed too actually. but brandon flower's voice is so strong and captivating to me. and he's fucking hot. they have this pounding sound that makes me want to dance. there's a drummer, basist, guitar and the singer with his electro keyboard and some other electro-sound board thang. i am in love with their sound. what if my name was suzi flowers? now that would be rad...!  fave killer song for now: mr brightside. other cd purchased: beastie boys, to the five boroughs.  getting ready for my trip! i leave in less than a week. the plan is puerto rico solo saturday - wednesday, then hopping over to virgin gorda, an island in the british virgin islands. meeting the college girlfriends there for denise's wedding. a 10-day vacation. bring it!

      that is the question.  on with it i guess... this weekend was wonderful! it was kerry's birthday weekend. jam-packed kerryliciousness. friday we went to the bfd concert at shoreline - me, kerry, merritt, andrew and alex, chris c, eric etc met us there. the streets were amazing. i am so in love with that geezer. his wit and honesty are so friggin cute. the highlight for me, though, was the beastie boys. this is their first performance here in sf in 4+ years and they had me dancing my ass off. they played some new songs and some great old skool stuff - time to get ill, body movin.. mix master mix never let's me down. mix master cut cut cut faster. uhh. adrok's hair is grey! they're like these old doods now still jumping around doing the freeze frame action. anyway, i flirted with the guard and he let me dance in the aisle so i could see so well and really git down. no complaints. props to my east coast boyz ;)  this was the first time i've hung out with ms merritt in months and it was refreshing. i do love her friendship. i'd be lying if i said it was all behind me. but. i am open to having her in my life and trusting her and i do believe we'll get there again. she and i get silly together and that's just too precious for me to forget.  saturday nite i went to gabe's art show in the berkeley marina. this was his annual show and he's come so far in a year. his pieces are selling for like $700 and up and they have so much character. i am so proud of him for really finding himself and doing what he loves. he is in search of the mystical. i think he's pretty mystical himself.    urlLink    gabe's works&nbsp; urlLink     i brought amy and maren. there was some wine tasting, a jazz band and fire dancing which we just missed cause i had to head to...   blacklight bowling for kerry's bday. like 20 of us at yerba buena. it was hysterical! i was in such a good mood - loved everyone, couldn't stop kissing everyone. hehe.    urlLink    kerrylicious&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    it's all a blur&nbsp; urlLink     lot of people loving my lady kerry - she totally deserved it. got to know dave. dave has been on my radar for some time. he's damn hot and a really interesting guy. we have a lot in common actually. i looked around his home and it felt like my home. there's soemthing to be said about finding someone who shares the love of plants and animals. and billy joel at 4am. ha. we spent sunday doing a lot of talking. i tried to see into him - to understand where he is in life, what confuses him and what amuses him. i feel like i opened up to him and showed him a lot more of me than i've shared with anyone in a while. and i liked it. not too much. which makes me breathe a sigh of relief. this is suzi time, after all!  last nite i went on a date with nick. the polar opposite of dave but just as good for different reasons. nick's another hottie. a british guy with wit and confidence. the other side of me relates to nick.. we share the passion for the finer things (good god how cliche is that) and romanticism. and he doesn't take himself too serious - i like a guy who can laugh at himself. he is charming and a total sweetheart. a genuine gentleman. opens car doors, treats me like a princess... chivalry is not dead and nick is walking proof :). and the best part is, he's all these things and not a bit pathetic. it has to be said - a lot of guys with these traits appear pathetic to me - like they try too hard. but i really just think it's part of him, it makes him very sexy. it's refreshing to be with such a gentleman. guys in sf are just not like that for the most part. his mum raised him right! anyway, the date was dreamy. he took me to millenium and then back to his place for tea. tea :). i'm still smiling. ohh boy.  tonight nothing makes me happier than being in my own space, alone, taking the time to reflect on  these past few days. there's still a lot in the noggin that's clear enough to get on paper, but i struggle with the idea of putting it all out there. i guess there is good reason for traditional pen and paper as well. there's also satisfaction in keeping some of that in here. i like secrets. and i like kisses. xoxox

      i just heard this song was the #1 song 10 years ago today. as in a DECADE ago. i still have it in my playlist... cindy lauper ROCKS! time after time... i sing along and love her.  Time After Time  by Cindy Lauper   Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, And think of you turning in circles  confusion is nothing new  Flashback to warm nights Almost left behind Suitcase of memories, Time after -  Sometimes you picture me  I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me,  I can't hear what you've said   Then you say, go slow  I´ll fall behind - The second hand unwinds  If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time  If you fall, I will catch you  I will be waiting Time after time Time after time  After your picture fades and  darkness hast urned to gray Watching through windows  i´m wondering, if you´re O.K.  And you say, go slow- i´ll fall behind The drum beats out of time -  If you're lost, you can look - and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you - I'll be waiting Time after time  If you fall, i will catchyou- I will be waiting  Time after time Time after time Time after time Time after time Time after time Time after time

      another hotel, another city. this one's sweeter.  day: wednesday.  city: seattle.  purpose: business, as usual.  difference: staying at the westin, i have an unusually large hotel room and i am overlooking the city i'd one day like to call home...  seattle is currently my favorite city in the US. it's just *charming*. i love cities by the sea - and seattle is not. BUt. it is surrounded by the puget sound, lake washington, etc. which fulfills my aquarian needs. on top of this, there are the most beautiful, green, thick forests covering rolling hills in every direction i look. if i'm lucky - and it's clear - i can also see these tremendous snow capped mountains to the west and to the southeast (mt rainier). it's all very breathtaking and the people are CHILL and warm and even have a little funk in them. it's a lot like sf, without the uber-urban edge. as i'm getting this unusual itch to move on from the city by the bay this wonderland is becoming more and more appealing to my earthy values.  i'm sick again! i need to go get those friggin blood tests. i have a cold. the flight up here was miserable because the pressure in my ears built up so thick and i was in excrutiating pain. i tried blowing them open and it didn't even help. i'm a little worried about flying tomorrow bc i really don't want to deal with that again.   recap of the rest of my weekend: sunday kerry, monica and i went to the walnut creek (the WC baby!) wine and art festival. it's this huge festival with wine tasting and beer tasting booths. you buy a glass and tasting tickets and wander around, getting drunk and spending a ton of money on local artists. in retrospect, it's money well spent. i'd rather support local artists that blow a ton of money in some corporate chain. but daaaaamn did i spend too much money! i went for the jewelers this time... i bought some beautiful teardrop onyx and granite earings and met this girl who blows glass and bought a gorgeous blue swirlly glass pendant. she even showed me the strands of glass she used to blow the piece. it was fresh. (ha- FRESH).    urlLink    kerry, monica, me&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    party hos&nbsp; urlLink     fought the urge to go home and be suzi homemaker and instead went over to eric's for some catfish and sopranos. fagggetaboowdit. kerry's cute. she's a vixen. she's going to fall in love.  this week is work and travel and nothing more but a headcold. this weekend has potential for danger and hootenanny, and i must get better!  today there is sex appeal in my stars. there is flirtation in my flurry. i am having one of those days the astrologers would consider a 'lucky love' day. not SO lucky - i am sitting in my hotel by myself blogging instead of loving, but there are a few stars aligned today - i can feel it. i like stars. i like to think i am one. a bright, twinkly one. that needs to go to bed now.

      i'm back in SF. my NY trip turned out fantastic. it was mellower than usual but had a deeper affect on me than usual. i looked at ny through eyes i never have before. maybe spring really is in the air. i made it a point to really take everything in. to stop and check every one of my senses. the air felt warm. it suprisingly didn't smell like the city can when it's warm (rotting garbage - yuck). i took in all the sights - the people, the streets, the construction, the stores. i listened to the accents and have to admit, hate a strong NY accent now. but i realized this time around that many of those people, living there, are transplants from all over. i heard more speak in other languages and west coast accents than i've noticed before.   i also spent more time in the west village than i have before, and i loved it. it's quiant yet fast moving and crowded. it's got a funky feel to it and trees. nice.  wednesday nite i had dinner with kara and tricia at westvill, a tiny little comfort food jem. and as i write this part i hope to god no one else actually reads this thing... but for my own memory i need to record it... after dinner we went past sarah jessica parkers house. of course i did. and i took a photo in front of it. ok, ok, i know i'm a lame celebrity stalker so 'nuf of that!   urlLink    suzi and the city&nbsp; urlLink      thursday nite i had dinner with corey, an old boyfriend who i dated for like a minute 4 or so years ago. i heart corey. dearly. talk about a masterpiece... this dood is such a good guy. he's kind and fun and sensitive yet all man. oh, did i mention he's totally into music has a pretty fucking cool job in the music industry trying to rake in the new blood in music? and he's so fucking hot too! hehe. we had dinner in tribeca - can't remember the name of the place though. after that we headed over to w village (or maybe soho?) and met kevin and desiree for drinks. we wound up going to automatic slims, which is a dive and hidden yet i went there last time i was here as well. it wasn't intentional to return and i didn't even realize i'd ever been there until i was inside. anyway, it was a lot like my college bars - really loud music, like the cheesy stuff - gloria, come on eileen, etc. and lots of cheesy people singing loud and dancing the same. ok i sang too. guilty as charged. when in rome...   urlLink    dez & kevin&nbsp; urlLink      kevin and dez went home and corey and i went to another bar. stayed up with him till 3 and decided he is definitely the best catch in the world. :). i haven't seen him in 2 years and i still felt completely comfortable with him and was really happy to see he is still the charming, sincere guy i knew. ex's are funny like that.  well, sometimes, like this time -- it's good to know they're not meant for you - so those confusing feelings don't screw up a fun night together - yet you still feel like you don't regret anything and hope someone special enough comes along and makes them really happy. hence, i heart corey.   urlLink    corey&nbsp; urlLink     it's great to be home!! i got in kinda late and kerry picked me up from the airport (side note: she's such a good friend!). we caught up over a bottle of damn good wine - one of the bottles i picked up in sonoma with amy.    urlLink    my star sister, *kerry*&nbsp; urlLink     today is saturday. i must still be on NY time bc i was up at 830 and couldn't get back to sleep. so i made the best of it - cleaned the apartment, started unpacking. then i packed up a backpack and headed to  urlLink mt diablo  for some hiking. and this time i really hiked!! i had a great hike - probably about 5 miles in total, lots of uphill and downhill. i kept thinking how i have to get this ass into a bathing suit in less than a month (i'm going to puerto rico - oo la la). so i powered on and it felt great. i took some good photos too. mt diablo is the highest peak in this area so the views are breathtaking. the kind you just can't capture on film. the california poppies are in bloom - they are my favorite. the air smelled so clean and i saw in total only about 10 other people the whole time. i love absorbing the energy from nature. the earth below my feet, the wildlife scurrying as i invade their world for a moment. i hugged a tree :)   urlLink    view of sf/bay area from top of mt diablo&nbsp; urlLink

      yo yo y'all... still in da hood!  hehe. new york makes me think i'm a ghetto chick. or at least it makes me start talking like dat. yo. :) it makes me laugh.  work with the peeps. oops, i mean colleagues. good stuff. i am a corporate girl livin in a corporate world. it keeps me livin' yo.  k, i'm done with da slang, yo.  *big grin*  work was good. went to sushi samba in the west village with tricia tonight. tricia and i went to college together and i love that girl to pieces. she lives with her man, matt. i witnessed the two of them doing the single thing for years. much like pigeons doing their mating dance... clucking their featers, then smooching up, then puffing their featers out again in the 'dance of love.'  they put each other through so much, just playing 'the game'. and now... true love. and so much of it. i don't even remember tricia before matt (ok i do, but for arguments sake...) - he brings out the most beatiful parts of her. she's so confident and witty in general - and with him - she just is more confident in being *TRICIA*. i love it. i love them.  after dinner i came back to the hotel and hit the hotel bar. it was empty except for the bartender natalia and her rocker dood friend, luke. we talked a lot. they're from brooklyn. luke was a big talker, with his tattoos and piercings. i liked them. he tells me he's an amazing musician and plays guitar and writes song. i believe him, he seems very genuine and creative. and modest. even if he did tell me that. he likes dave matthews, which surpises me cause he just seems too rocker for dave. but being a dave lover, i have to like him for it. and like him for going against the grain.  we talked about how they think brooklyn has changed, and how it's all down the tubes. they recongize 'the russians' coming into the 'guido' neighborhoods and opening their own 'social clubs'. it's pretty amusing. they are very sterotypical, yet when i try to insinuate this luke says he loves all people, and cultural divirsity is good. as much as i think he thinks that's true - and i do think this is an open minded dood - i don't think it's true. 'the russians taking over' is not very open minded, really. i mean, he had a point --- that no one accepts it and it's not making a community, but making people in the neighborhood hate each other, and now it's just lots of different groups, doing their thang, hating the different people around them. so it doesn't make a neighborhood, he's right. but all the sterotypes, the words, the acceptance of what it 'should be' and what might be encroaching on it... not quite as liberal and open-minded as he expected to be. hell, i still liked him anyway :) and i liked hearing his thoughts.  home (home=hotel). email from an afar friend who has somehow found this blog. part of me is holding back... i want to talk about that. i want to get all my feelings out. but thank you, dear friend, for reminding me i am not alone in this blogworld. so you know - the tests came back just fine. thank you for your concern, sweetie.

      i've brought him in for a brainstorm. i have to say the conversation was easy and nice and comfortable but nothing stimulating. but i feel like everything about the smudger&nbsp;is overly stimulating but i wonder if anything is more personal. i met one on top of the other. and you were drunk when you guys hooked up? well i don't think that lends well to conversation. admittedly he was really insecure the next day. and kept repeating himelf and stumbling over his words. he's not really my type. i can't even get what type he is. but i mean he's a clean cut nice guy. wait, paris hilton is gonna be rapping?? you've got to be kidding me. i'm seeing&nbsp;DP tomorrow and i'm gonna see the smudger&nbsp;on sunday. eternal bachelorette. i don't believe you, just rock on and have fun. i was never able to date multiple guys when i was single.  are you single? i don't know what the fuck i am to be honest. 3rd R? i guess. not with any regularity. you know i hooked up with him?&nbsp;umm i said fuck it. the last couple times ive been trashed around him i've been like what the fuck. go on. if&nbsp;geekboy even knows where your blog is i know where this will end up. he's&nbsp;had a crush on me since like 2 yrs ago. we're&nbsp;gonna see each other or your out of my life. seeing each other no expectations. ive got 2 guys who are totally like oh&nbsp;my god and i dont want any part of it. clam bake. had to invite him. i won't invite him if you don't want&nbsp;to. it's&nbsp;called incest. don't want you to be the silent resenter. committed to cooking this dinner with the gut and&nbsp;3rd R&nbsp;being there. this&nbsp;girl named&nbsp;H it is and i love it.&nbsp;   urlLink    merritt & kerry, 2/3&nbsp; urlLink      falling down the route hole he's not gonna be good this weekend. yeah okay whatever clean and pure and nothing to do with these people and has different ideas of what fun is how disgusting the people he loves and cares  i dont think she has much to offer - i dont think she does much you wont drink it all. it'll go bad. i'm a lush and it's fine. we log on at late night and we're fucked up by ourselves. _you _ have to log on...we've had a menagea'trois with andrew at late night!!! i write better, i'm more open, i'm more creative when i'm drunk. siatic nerve. upper back. book about signs. four-eyes...look at these three hotties.&nbsp; and with this song..."i'm horny.&nbsp; so horny.&nbsp; horny horny horny toniiigggttt!'  oh ma godoh ma godoh ma godoh ma godoh ma godoh ma godoh ma god. he is the worst sign ever.&nbsp; i never get along with scorpios. in a word this man is irresistable.&nbsp;  with me he is extrememly emotional and intelligent.&nbsp; but he never gets deep.&nbsp; he made parsnips, potatoes, pears, and pork.&nbsp; and it was AMAZING! did he get it out of a recipe? he had to.&nbsp; he didn't ask me for any help, but he didn't know what he was doing.&nbsp; no directions and it was perfect. that's hot. god, that's so fucking hot. i'm so fucked! has a little pussy got your tongue? say it! i think he sounds great. i have not? about me? why are you holding back. it was a random fleating thought and now it gone. you're so over this?? alright...whatever...you liar. what we're we talking about. i'm really scared. cuz i'm really fuking scared and i'm scared bc i never felt this about geek boy ever. how boring it would be if you felt the same for every person you ever dated? that would suck. but i've just wanted to feel that admiration for my partner...ooohhh. you're lucky you feel that right now. it's fucking scary tho now. whether i get my heart broken, or it works... i just feel like this is supposed to be "me" time now. i think it's really importnat that you get "you" time. to me that the major thing. he's droppin e for ten days. i think it's right for him. however, if that weren't happening.&nbsp; i'd be more on the track of.... how long have you been seeing him again? a couple months.&nbsp; i'm feeling pressure bc i really fucking like him and i don't want to loose that. i dated a guy for 2 1/2 years and i've never felt it. well then yayy!!!&nbsp; that's exciting.&nbsp; celebrated it, love it, enjoy it. yes, that exactly what i need to hear. relationships would be boring without that.  &nbsp;

      writing in Suzi's blog.&nbsp; She's been telling me about this whole blog thing for awhile, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Tonight we were planning our girlie vacay to Vancouver and Seattle over Labor Day weekend.&nbsp; No boys (except the ones we meet there!), lots of time outdoors, some relaxation, and plenty of good music and fun.&nbsp; All in all, a pretty great vacation in my eyes.&nbsp; I could certainly use this right now!!  Suzi, no backing out!!!!!  kisses, kerry   urlLink    kerry's new tat  urlLink

      Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) If you're spending time with someone special, steer clear of him or her on Monday; he or she is going to be emotionally volatile. With Mars and his lover, Venus, waltzing across Texas or the velvet sky (same difference) on Tuesday, why ruin a perfect date night with lingering resentment? Get packing on Friday: the weekend's full moon will fall in your third house of short trips and kinky hotel sex. The moon also falls in Aquarius, so be sure your hotel has a pool or is near the ocean. There are few things better than having sex in the water, under the pale (and full) moonlight.

       i have georgia purple font. right on.    &nbsp;  such a great weekend. friday i got this random email from some 'vip list' i'm on that offered me a chance to get me + 4 friends in FREE (!!! can't you hear the excited flyer-writer?!?!?) for a champaign tasting party at suite 181.&nbsp; suite 181 - never heard of it. of course i haven't - i live here. as opposed to the south bay. where most of the beautiful (smirk) people there came from.    &nbsp;  i shouldn't talk shit - i actually had a fun time. the dj played prom beats - like old skool hip-hop, which i admittedly know every word to and have fun hearing on random nights like this - and the jackson 5. he also played the magic stick... (what what... maaa-aaagic :) ). we got a few couches and all dressed in our swanky, sexy gear took in the sights and sounds and chatted up our lovley friends over champaign and good friends. it was me, merrit, christine and dave, dave's roommate daniel and christine's friend kevin. hhm. interesting cross-section of mankind. i paired up with kevin and he was cute and sweet and let me ask him a lot of questions about who he was and i enjoyed hearing his story. late night in the haven.    &nbsp;  i met nick on saturday at whole foods. he was having a dinner party at his place for his 2 partners and their wives. i was his date and this, admittedly, freaked me out. i know from the boys that the 'partners' and their 'wives' are cool as shit but it still felt a but high pressure. is that normal? i guess.. anyway, we did the whole foods and crate and barrel thing, then went to his place and prepped and cleaned. why do i always clean boys bathrooms is what i want to know!?? ha. i had to. really, i'm the one that will appreciate it most so i'll shut up about that.    &nbsp;  i really liked his friends. they were good people and good conversation and i felt like they took a lot of interest in getting to know me, and i appreciated that. nicole was the first i met. sweetheart of a mom who has a 16-yr old and daaamn doesn't seem like she could. we could call her a MILF (or a MTLF? -- just to be clear - not M I'd LF... M they'd LF...). teaches cooking classes - i want to take one. she was really warm towards me. barry is her husband. barry's just cool. barry's like the dad you wish you had. so i convinced&nbsp;them to adopt&nbsp;me. so these are&nbsp;my newly adopted (rad) parents.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;    &nbsp;  the other couple were chris (another brit) and yvonne. yvonne i definitely related to the most and got my girl-friend-like chat on with. she's gorgeous and such a kind-hearted woman. i liked her also because she's a girly-girl - like i could talk about hair and clothes and all that with her and it was open and funny and great. her husband, chris, i think is the closest of the bunch to nick... not to do with the brit or soccer thang i'm sure. ha. ok, that probably has something to do with it. chris was the first to really talk to me sat nite. he asked me a lot of questions about myself and we got into random IQ conversation, so he will be considered my conversationalist of the night. really - though - i did enjoy my coversation with him. and he was mostly spearhearding some of the suzi questions i mentioned earlier.    &nbsp;  good people. and good friends to nick, and i could tell. i&nbsp; am fond of the friendships he has with them. it's different than what i have with my closest and i find it really interesting. how friendships can differ so. how at points in your life your closest friends are the ones that will party with you every night. and how there are other friends that will do that with you in the comfort of your home and accept your new friend and make them feel like they're part of the family.    &nbsp;  it's mad to eat meat. caution.

      what the fuck? i have the abnoral freak and shit about nick and it's normal - i know it is. i just need to talk about it and have my friend, who i confide in, check me. tell me it's normal, tell me i'm gorgeous, tell me it's alllll good.   why did chris make me think i need to chill? why did he make me feel like i was blindly jumping into something and i need to freak out and stop? from my interactions with nick he digs this.. whatever the fuck 'this' is. so do i.   i am loving the me styyyle. i am lovin the cute-boys-i-can-look-at-with-that-flirt-on-- time. i am not down with feeling needy. i am not down with chris making me feel this insecurity.

      reality is rough. after my 10-day vacation to the carribean i've been blessed with daydreams of my trip and a golden glow. i have momentary flashbacks of sand between my toes, being underwater, the sun warming me as i float in the pool, my friends giggling, sipping a beer, watching little yellow birds perched on my villa wall, skinny dipping, kissing, more giggling... a week ago right now i sat in a plane reflecting on the experience and feeling an anxiety i had not expected. did i set my out-of-office email? do i call this person when i get home or do i wait a few days? is rusty ok? did i leave my apt a mess? how do i get thru all that email i missed?   i've recovered from the anxiety this week, and it's back to it was right before i left. nothing has changed. except, perhaps, my perceptions. my outlook. my trip was empowering for me. to be so detached, to be able to form attachments with many people so easily. to know that i was the captain and this ship was going where i wanted it to. and there were no winds pushing me in the wrong direction. i had full control. easy sailing. perfection.  i expected this freedom and this comfort i got from the stillness and freedom to spill over to my life here. for me to stick to my agenda. for everything else to fall into place. and as soon as i got home, i found myself reaching out for my friends. calling to hear their voices, wanting to be near them and make sure they remember me. trying to fit into their agendas. this partly angers me. i want to walk to the beat of my drum, but subconsciously i am trying to fit in with the rest of the marching band. what gives?  well the marching band rocked out to some fun toons this weekend. friday i had happy hour drinks at the valley tavern with courtney and amy j. why don't we do happy hours more often!? from there amy came to my place to watch me freak out as i tried to get ready to see nick. i still am a mess at this dating thing. i think, actually, it's because i care about him. but that's all i'll say about that. nick and i had - what was supposed to be a chill nite - which kinda was with the exception of the bottle of wine and other stuff - watching a movie and ordering in. i'm awkward around him. he is around me, too. it wears off after being together a little while but while i'm awkward i'm awkward. anyway. saturday we went to mclaren park for kelly's good-bye and natalie's bday. kelly heads back to singapore tomorrow - which is sad, because she is such a positive, kind woman that i wish i had time to know better.  yesterday (sunday) was the perfect san francisco-with-the-girlfriends day. i laid out in the sun on my deck for an hour when i woke up. kerry picked me up and we got merritt and went to julie's supper club for brunch. this crew throws a party on the 2nd sunday of every month, 'rehab.' there are djs and lots of beatuful people - seemingly mostly hot gay guys. you are greeted at the door by a nurse who checks you into rehab. there are people punked out in lab coats and shirts that say 'rehab sucks' and 'i met my wife in rehab.' great party vibe and it's only noon. we get seated and there's an enquirer article (the rehab people made it) about mary kate's addiction to cocain and some other silly, drug-related, rehab-related articles. so cute. we sit and this guy in a labcoat pushes a cart over to us and offers us vicodin and/or valium. these are actually shots, i come to learn. like, drinking shots. in test tubes, of course. we each get a valium or a vicodin and order a pitcher of bloody mary. yum. andrew arrives, sits behind us. he's been at the end-up since 7am and totally drunk and funny. i order an intervention from the man in the labcoat and he gives andrew a vicodin. classic :)  from there, the girls and i headed over to see eve ansler's 'the good body' at a theater near union sq. i saw her when she was in town last year doing the vagina monologues. she's rad. an in-your-face, blunt, comical feminist who really opens your mind to what society drills into a woman's head as being 'right.' she goes on about the 'skinny bitches' and i cringe a little, because i know i'm one of them. but we all have our issues so skinny bitch or not i relate. what did i learn? i have the spread. the spread is when you've got a nice, round booty but then it starts to spread... :)  from there we went to the sunset party in golden gate park. it only went for about an hour or two once we got there, but it was good to dance a little and see some familiar faces. being out of the scene for a few months i feel like a stranger to them, but they accept me with warm hugs and i appreciate that.   ended the evening with burridos and fritz and merritt at my place just chatting it up and being silly. it's monday. i am so obviously procrastinating at work!

      alright, i get it, you didn't get the last post.  scene: me, kerry, merritt. bottle of red wine. chatter bout life. another bottle of red wine. lots of girl talk. you got pieces of it as i transcribed it. i loved it. i know you didn't get it - we did - sorry. ladies... smirkes and winks goin' out to you...  this weekend: brass tax vs friends and family at willits. a word about willits... there's a campground called camp & sons, run by this older hippie couple who i can't remember their names but they are the sweetest couple on earth. they let us come up there and throw weekend campouts with djs and freaks and disco balls and visual art, etc. this was my 5th time up there and it continues to live up to its reputation of being one of the most laid-back (yet raving at night) and uniquely special northern california jems. hundreds of freaks just loving the music, the company, the sun, the pond (which i think personally is NASTY but some like that stuff so...), the hot tubs (repeat previous comment here), the gardens that are so beautifully maintained, the chickens and roosters (i woke up to a chicken in my tent [NOT ME!] - hysterical...) and being surrounded by nature. if there was a god i would believe he put this place on earth for me.   urlLink    the pond&nbsp; urlLink     380 tickets sold, smaller party than i'm used to up there but thoroughly consumed and digesting with ease and happiness. this was such an amazing weekend, with music i haven't heard in too long and loooooved and friends i haven't seen in too long and duuuuug and outdoors and a full moon and sharing my tent, ride, weekend and giggles with one ms merritt. priceless. and beyond words.   urlLink    partners in crime&nbsp; urlLink     took 5 hrs to get there - should have been less than 3. had parties and happy hour in the jeep on the way up... dirt road in, putting the tent up as the sun in setting, no flashlights or lanterns and it's allll good. thank you neighbors.  social anxiety till we feel the love. great music, great dj's. then came the hard-motha-fuckin-house. me, merritt and ding dong in the garden, chatting it up, so nice to have funny friends, the hard house makes me want to pull my hair out. can't get away from it - this is willits goddamit! all music all the time, love it. i went to bed.  saturday - peaceful, comfortable day in the garden. warm weather, clear blue beautiful skies, wooded hills in the distance and funked-out costumed beautiful hippies in the forefront. merritt wants grilled cheese. a random, kind dood comes around with a platter of triangle-shaped grilled cheeses. want one? WHAT.   urlLink    jess, me, merritt&nbsp; urlLink     i need a cold beer. one finds me. it is the magic garden. i love the magic garden at willits! i have total faith in its magical fulfillness!   urlLink    the dancefloor in daylight&nbsp; urlLink     saturday night highlight for me was fred (funk) and mike's (loosebeats) tag-team set. hands down the best set i've heard in like years. and ranu on the visuals, everything gorgeous and perfect and WHAT.?   urlLink    i'm ready&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    fred funk&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    firedancer&nbsp; urlLink     i danced hard. i smiled like crazy. i met my body twin. i felt at home in a place i haven't been in months and am gracious for the comfort of those friends and beats.   urlLink    dk & colin&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    mike & me eating his cake&nbsp; urlLink
