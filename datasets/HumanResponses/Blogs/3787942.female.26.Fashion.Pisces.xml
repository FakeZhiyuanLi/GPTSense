						   it's cool, flaix tv is playing lots of videos i like today. i wish they played more HIM, though. they used to, but now they don't anymore, even though lots of people request them. i wonder why!  i think my mocca frap made me kinda sick. i also wonder why!  speaking of wondering... i wonder where i've put my black eyed peas cd and the bellydancing flyer i found yesterday! this house has holes or something.  Yesterday i basically relaxed at home, since i wasn't working. i did some online stuff in the morning, then i worked out and watched stuff i had taped from tv. I also did some paper stuff with my dad, to get my tax money returned. not sure what it's called in english. i had to call my boss so she'd fax me a sheet i needed and stuff. kinda messy, but hey, i'm getting 52 euros returned, it's worth it! lol At night, my dad's friend from estonia came for dinner. he was leaving this morning to go back to his country. finally! lol This morning i went to the cosmetic testing place, got my 25 euros for the test i ended, and then i had to bring these tax papers to the bank or a specific tax office, and since today is the last day to do it my dad told me to expect to waste all morning, and that i had to go to the bank where my account is set and all. well, i went to another bank and i was done in exactly 2 minutes! haha I almost forgot: yesterday my cat received 2 parcels. she gets more mail than me! lol. one was a free cat food sample i ordered online a few months ago -she loved it- and the other was a free blanket from a cat food company -my cat looked at me as if saying "are you crazy? a blanket when it's so hot? i wanted more food!" lmao  this morning i felt invisible: i went to make a photocopy and the lady was serving people who came in *after* me! wtf? i said "hello, i'm here!" and she said "wait, it's only a minute!". yeah, a minute... and it will be a minute if you serve 5 more people, right? it's only a minute for me too!  then in the bus people were shoving me as if they didn't see me in the middle. wtf?

						   he finally left. my dad's estonian friend. mr.unbearable! lol. he stayed here for 3 months and he's going back to estonia tomorrow morning. he's not a bad man, but he just gets on my nerves with all his lip smacking when he speaks, and all these random words he repeats 4 or 5 times in a row in most sentences. besides the way he looks at me makes me unconfortable. *shivers* funny enough, his youngest daughter is adorable. i wish i had seen her for a longer time!  i should quit drinking alcohol for a few days now. i've been drinking a little whenever that guy i mentioned above came for lunch or dinner, and yesterday i drank 1 liter of beer, and tonight i drank 2 glasses of champagne. not only is it bad for health if you drink too much -we all know that- but it's also starting to make me think a little too much. not about useful things, that is. it makes my lack of self-confidence come back to the surface. i think i'd better go to sleep and remember that if i was as boring as i think i am, i wouldn't have any friends. besides the champagne i drank (i was about to type "ate" lol) tonight has made me sleepy.

						   i'm liking this site so far! i joined this morning and i'm exploring it for now :)  i feel like rambling a little right now, then i'll go do some workout.   it's so damn hot here! i wish it was winter all year long. i know many places are much hotter than here, it's "only" 33ÂºC or so, but i can't stand the heat. it takes all my energy away, the sun blinds me and makes me bitchy... cold weather makes me wanna do things, go out, walk, etc.   i want to browse websites about bush. i want to learn more about that stupid dumbass, just to have more reasons to critisize him! haha. i'm mean. but yeah, whatever i hear about him is so stupid i can't even understand how an ignorant like that can be so powerful. blergh, crazy world.

						   i'm testing this blog site to see if people actually read it.   yesterday afternoon i went to work. it went ok, i got a couple of customers, although only one bought something and it was the cheapest thing we have in the store. lol. oh well. the other one was kinda snobby. blah to her.  after work i met up with my boys downtown. that is, with alan and albert. i was so happy to see them! i missed them a lot -i hadn't seen them in 3 weeks if you're wondering. we had a couple of beers and talked for like 3 hours. it was fun! i like it better when ruth is there, though, because the guys often start talking about 80's videogames and all that stuff they played with when they were kids and i barely have any childhood memories, so i'm kinda clueless. lol. oh well, no biggie, it was fun anyway.  you know what's funny? alan told us how he made out with that girl in these 3 weeks he was away and i'm not even jealous. yet i like him more than ever. i mean, it's as if i felt, deep inside, that no matter how many girls he dates/makes out with/has sex with, he will end up with me when he wants a more serious relationship. i feel we're made for each other and that gives me the patience to wait. i *will* have fun with other guys every time i have a chance to, i won't be silly, i have to live too! lol. but i feel alan is my man. i've never felt that way with other guys i've known/dated. oh, and he let out in the conversation that he doesn't mind a girl to be overweight as long as she's well toned-up, and he said it looking at me. that's even more motivation to workout!! lol  we all went home at like midnight, and the last subway leaves at midnight too... i had to take 2 trains to go home and missed the second one, so i had to walk for 30 minutes. blergh. happily i'm not working today, so i don't mind that i didn't sleep a lot. i'm gonna be busy, though, i have to go to the bank, to the post office, do some legal paper stuff with my dad this afternoon, and there are several things that need to be done at home, and a few phone calls to be made.    who is who & other stuff:  *work: i'm a plus sized clothes store clerk, part time. the store barely ever sells and is about to close. *alan: guitarist of my band. i've had a crush on him since march. *albert: drummer of my band. *ruth: keyboardist/singer of my band. i'm the other singer.

						   i was having lunch today and my dad started getting on my nerves again with the way he eats. it's not such a big deal itself, he makes noise whenever he opens his mouth to eat, more people do that. but it doesn't get on my nerves because it's gross, it only gets on my nerves when my dad does it, not when other people do it. why? because i find it obscene when it's him. the way he half sticks out his tongue to put the food on it, the way he often quickly darts the tip of his tongue to the corners of his lips with his mouth half open, all this is SO obscene! i can't stand it anymore. each and every time it happens it brings me back to when i was a kid and i went on vacation with my parents. we all slept in the same room to save money and my parents used to have sex with me right there, not even checking if i was asleep. these obscene noises i kept hearing night after night have followed me through the years.  back then, whenever i protested that i wanted to sleep my dad would just get mad and say i wanted to split them. i didn't realize it then, but i felt totally left out, ignored, like i was unimportant. like he was stealing my mom, as he was always the one starting the sex sessions. my mom was all i had back then. i often tried to talk to her about that problem but i felt too ashamed and never actually told her. i couldn't get the words out of my mind. it was like being forced to hear porn every night, and when you're 11 to 15 years old it's not good, believe me. when i think about it now, i feel like i was being abused. i've never really told anyone about this, and i hope nobody will judge me here.   i can't bring that topic back to my parents now, what's done can't be undone, i know that's what they will tell me -they have told me this other times about other problems. what can i do to forget that? it's not like it's a problem in my life, it's not -i've had boyfriends, i've had sex... maybe it's the cause of some very weird sexual fantasies i have, but that's about it. but it does contribute to the hate i still keep inside towards my dad. we've never had a good relationship until a couple of years ago, but recently i've felt my hate for him coming back sometimes. i need to live on my own, damnit! maybe then things will get better on that side! but for now i really can't afford it.

						   on friday afternoon i went shopping with my mom, as we both needed clothes. we went to that store, kanak, which has only big sizes and very cool clothes, not only potato sacks (although there's a bit of that too). when i first started going to that store i used to need their biggest size, xxl, but now i need l or xl, which is the size most of their clothes are, so i went crazy. it was like all i liked i barely needed to check the size, i knew it would suit me. i felt normal! after trying on a bunch of clothes, i ended up buying a pair of black pants with little strings hanging from the sides on the hips and ankles, a black halter top, and a pink t-shirt with a very large neck that actually falls halfway down my arms and would show my entire bra if i didn't wear anything else, with slits here and there held closed with rows of safety pins. the halter top is actually too big for me, but it was the only one left and i've been looking for one for so long! i'll have it adjusted to my size.  yesterday morning i went to work. i was alone with judith and we only worked for like 5 minutes, then served an annoying customer whom i had to calm down, and spent the rest of the morning just talking reading tarot cards and stuff like that.  we had lunch at our bosses' place and spent a good while swimming in their pool. it was fun, judith and i were fooling around with the floating matress and stuff like that. i got a little sunburnt again, though.  in the afternoon i met up with ruth downtown. we didn't start off too well: she was 35 minutes late and i was mad at her, while she was mad at her mom because of a fight she just had, and me being mad at her didn't help. i couldn't avoid criticising her constant need of buying and buying. it pisses me off because she buys things she doesn't really need and she owes me 40 euros and owes cristina 100 euros. she could have returned us that money a long time ago if she hadn't bought so much junk!  oh well, we both calmed down after a while. i went to buy books with a gift certificate i had, and then i texted albert from a public phone so that he'd call me because i had no money. he called me and since he was near there we met up a few minutes later. we all went to buy alan's birthday present. his birthday is on july 13th, but it's a concert ticket and the concert takes place today. we decided to buy him that because it was too expensive for him, but 3 people can afford it.  we then went for a drink and spent a good while there, just talking. it was cool! then annie left me some missed calls on my cell phone. i asked albert to let me text her with his phone, and annie texted me back saying she was feeling down and needed to talk, but that she'd e-mail me. i felt so sorry i couldn't call her! i hope she's feeling a little better today. she still hasn't e-mailed me. if i don't hear from her, i'll call her this afternoon. but i feel bad, she needed me and i wasn't there for her.  when we left the bar, we found alan. he was getting out of work, so we all talked some more. we gave him his concert ticket, he was so happy!

						   this is what i wrote this morning:  i don't feel like writing a lot today. i'm tired because of the heat... besides there isn't much to say, except what ruth told me last night: lately she's been kinda sick, a flu or something like that, but nothing too bad until tuesday night when she was rushed to hospital because she had a temperature of 43ÂºC!! that's almost deadly! happily she's doing better now. i'm gonna go see her this afternoon. i feel bad for not going sooner...  work was ok yesterday afternoon and this morning. quite a lot to do, with some stuff we're returning to the provider. blah.  ********************* i was kinda down, worried about ruth, and annie too, hoping she wasn't too depressed and all. i chatted with annie this afternoon and she seems ok. i hope she's not hiding her pain if any.   i also chatted with mar, whom i hadn't talked to for ages, and this random guy from here, but he wasn't too interesting and... this portuguese guy who said something so beautiful to me! he said "if your voice is as pretty as you look, you must be an angel!" it feels so good!   ruth is doing better now. so that all cheered me up.
