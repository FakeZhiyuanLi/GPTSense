						   My Last Post Befo Da New Year....  Well my friends, the new year is upon us. So ill just share wit u guyz my experiencez that i had. Well first off...dis year was when i first got into da varsity team, I have a lot of memories durin da season, like gettin into da playoffz and all kindz of stuff. Also dis was da year where i found a beautiful girl who i have fallin deeply inlove wit, ahhhh...too bad thingz didnt go da way we both wanted. The hard times and da good times we shared were very memorable...and were probly a big part of my life. My love for u dis year was da strongest i have ever felt about someone...through all da girlz i have been wit durin my life...none of dem stood out da way u did, whenever i c u or talk to u...it just makes my day and i feel happy...but idk where dis stuff is goin...eh, i feel pathetic bout stayin in love wit u, but i just have a feelin dat im doin da right thing but...only time will tell. But ya know imma keep fightin...tryin to get to thoze betta dayz...imma keep fightin fo what i believe...imma keep fightin fo da happiness im longin fo. Also dis was a year where i found my true friend, my homeboy darrell danque, wit out dat guy...man, i would probly still b a depressive wreck and probly just b a sad person fo da rest of my life. I would take a bullet fo dat guy ppl...fa realz. As i look back...all i could just do is smile...all da new thangz i have experienced...all da new friendz i have made... all da memoriez dat will b wit me fo a long time. Also all da craziness dat was goin on and all da answerz i have found out and all da questionz dat have came after. Yes, my friendz, dis has been one of da most memorable yearz dat i will ever have, but there is gonna b a new one comin up in a few hourz. Hopefully, thangz will b betta and my love life, my vball life, even my school life, will improve and change fo da betta. Hehe, thinkin about what happened dis year is just kinda funny to me, but whateva...C U NEXT YEARRR PPL!!!...Dis b charlez and my outta hurrrrr

Anywayz guess what i found...the infamous "rejection" letter...yes i have kept this letter just to sob over it. Well afta i read it...I tore dat shit up...and just laughed it up. I felt a release come over me as i tore dis letter up and it felt good. Well back to the year ending...well guyz to me dis year was a year of growin up. It has been a year for love and it has been a year fo dispair...but as i look back, all i could do is laugh it up, cuz i know there will b anotha year, anotha chance, anotha errrthang. It has been a year where my true friends have helped me in my time in need...and i help thoze dat need to b help and cuz i really care about dem...datz just the type of guy i am...carin, lovin, and honest. But I hope next year will b waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay betta den dis year...and im lookin foward to it...well HAPPY NEW YEARZ!!! YA HURRRRD!!!....p to da aaaaaaaaayce to da out to da side

						   Well today my mom and i went to the college fair thingy at school. It was coo, but borin cuz i went cuz my mom wants to know about financial aid and what is required for me to get in a good school...thanx mom. Anywayz im lookin foward to the upcoming up volleyball tournament (already have 203 killz...w00t), so i guess me and my teammates r gonna try to pull for 1st and also beef up my stats, which is not as important as winning. So i might write something later on, but until then...the saga continues.  The new song that is now stuck in my head, not really new but yeah  John Mayer-My Stupid Mouth   My stupid mouth Has got me in trouble I said too much again To a date over dinner yesterday And I could see She was offended She said "well anyway..." Just dying for a subject change  Oh, another social casualty Score one more for me How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one soon  We bit our lips She looked out the window Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker And I could see clearly An indelible line was drawn Between what was good, what just slipped out and what went wrong  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget?  Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now  One more thing Why is it my fault? So maybe I try too hard But it's all because of this desire I just wanna be liked, I just wanna be funny Looks like the jokes on me So call me captain backfire  Oh, the way she feels about me has changed Thanks for playing, try again. How could I forget? Mama said "think before speaking" No filter in my head Oh, what's a boy to do I guess he better find one  I'm never speaking up again. It only hurts me I'd rather be a mystery Than she desert me  Oh I'm never speaking up again Starting now

						   Well ppl i didnt get out til like 6:00, i basically chilled wit dan(club coach) the whole night. We went to the villanova game against Thatcher, villa lost but guess what...after the game...THEY HAD A FREAKIN 4 SQUARE TOURNAMENT!!!!!...i was amazed that high school ppl still play game famous in the world of elementary school, hehe...meeeeemorrrrrieeeeeeeeeeeeez. Anyways i basically talked to dan about the problems that i had with "the love triangle", but he gave great advice and i thank him for that. Dan can b an ass at times, but he can also b a great person in helping other ppl out and it really helps. Well until next time....stay tuned

						   -WHY HER?-  This can not be happening. Everything i know is collapsing. I felt that i really knew her. Now making me a disbeliever. I thought i knew what love was. Till i found out what she does. There she is trying to hide this from me. Now i know what i could not see. My heart is falling to pieces. Yet her beauty still shimmers and glicens. I can not bare to except what is. So much pain running through my head. I wish to die and forever rest in bed. But then she has won. Forcing my feelings, i must go on. What we could have shared with eachother. It would have been a relationship like no other. If she could only see. What she will be missing. Someone to truly love her. A person to love her, a person like me...

						   I reflected how much and how long i love her...its funny when u could of done something in the past that would of made things different now, but cant repeat the past. If only i knew the situation i was in, if only i would of known that she really liked me a lot. But then when i really started to like her...i was too late. Now i have sought and fought for that love for a long time...if only i could change the past...but i cant, all i can do is let fate take its course and let her c again whats in front of her. Her heart and mind battle, mind did that aswell. I always wanted my heart to win but it couldnt face the reality of the mind, so inorder to make them agree...you must make them both face reality, but it is ur and my decision. As I cry and wonder...i think this can end in a better way, it may not b the way u want, but i think it will end in a better way...as the world turns   urlLink Someday

						   Well at last another weekend has arrived...I have finally decided to let her go...My love for her is measured with pain that is inside of me. I have tried...but failed, I probly took no for an answer. Well I wont let this get me down again. I hated being depressed and sad, and I hated fighting for something that I cant win over. It was her choice to do this, she says it was for the best. As i take my path of shame and revival of life, I hope i will come upon happiness...the happiness that i have been missing for so long. Tune in to what the future reveals in the life of a defeated fighter, in his quest for a chance...the saga continues

Some ppl change for the better and some ppl change for the worse, it just happenz, and when u try to help...some thingz help some thingz dont...i just wish thingz would of been different, but i guess thingz that u wish for never come true...thats what i have learned...ive learn that no matter how hard u try at something...it still doesnt get the job done. I felt that i just tried and tried and tried, but nothing happenz.

Last night...i cried asleep again, cryin about whats killin me...which is love.   ...I don't wish to be everything to everyone, but I would like to be something to someone...  ...a song for her  Maroon 5-"She Will Be Loved"  Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Well folkz idk whats goin on for me in the future, i try to predict the it, but it alwayz just tearz me apart and it sux. So im just gonna take thingz day by day, again tryin to seek that happiness that i have been longin for...still hurtz...  regarding u(u know who u r)...its ur choice, its up to u to do whats right, i tried my ass off, its just up to u to make the right decision...and no matter what path u choose...ill understand, ur a great person...i can trust ur decision.  ...captain out

						   Finally answers...but where there r answers...there r more questions to ask, Like "Why does this keep happening to me?", "Is this meant to be?", "Does God hate me?", "Will I ever love again?"...I guess she doesnt want my love for her, i guess this my destiny...to fail. But seriously though, i try everything to plz a girl...but i just get a fucking slap in the face for my actions. I fucking get my ass left in the dust. I fucking bust my as for fucking nothing. It just pisses me off...and i feel like an idiot for doing this shit to myself and doing this shit for her. *sigh*...i guess u still like him, and i guess there isnt gonna b any change, and ive tried hard to make that change happen, but i guess my best isnt good for u...good bye

						   "This Love"-Maroon 5  I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on her hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do

						   Well my friendz...i guess it has ended...but in a bad way. I feel that i have been stabbed about 50 million times in my heart and a slap in the face for everything i did. I have been kind, nice, loving...but i guess that just doesnt suit ppl. Ive been doing this shit for abso-fucking-lutely nothing. It hurts im telling u...and it just pisses me off because i alwayz work hard all of my life and i dont get the credit i deserve. So i guess my best isnt good enuff for some ppl, so i guess they could suck my big fat azn cock because they r fucking assholes. So i guess i b goin to paaaaaaaayce the fuck out...the saga continues...

But my mind is equally as strong and tries to bring it down(its kinda like a neo and agent smith thing...kinda lame).

						   Whats up folkz...I jus got back from ojai cuz i had to do my recruitment video. I only completed the beggining part of it, so i need to come on another day and also i needed more ppl to help out. Nick came to help and i appreciated that, it shows me how much he would help and teammate and a friend. Also dan helpin out was key cuz i wouldnt b doin this without him, haha. Hhanywayz, the first part of the video i had to make a little intro to tell where the coaches where im from and stuff and what im gonna b demonstratin in the video. Then i had to do the passing part of the video, first it was serve recieve and free ball passin, i did pretty damn good. Then i had to do digging, i had like 3 overpasses...BLAH!...i was hella tired cuz it was like a 3 minute coach-on-one. Then i had to pass and get outside to hit, which was alright except for like 2 passes. Finally i had to get to the hitting part of the video, i only did the beggining part which was pass the ball and then get outside to hit. I hit the ball pretty well, but it could of been a lot better. So maybe next time when im gonna finish the video, i might have to do some of the drills over and finish hitting and get servin and blockin out of the way. So yea...that was my day so far...now to do some freakin garcia hw...stupid...lata.   urlLink Superman(Its Not Easy)

How in the hell did my life get better???haha...funny how all of those were answered yesterday...She had been tryin to get him for like almost a year now and her attempts were unsuccessful, but i encourage her to do the right thing...she tried to get me for...a week. Yeah, well i know she tried her hardest, but i guess a week did not do, so its back to bein this shit again. Well until she realizes that he doesnt want her or she realize that she doesnt need him or i realize that i must move on...its over. But until those days come, then i must b on the process of letting go...its a long one..but ive been betrayed too many times, ive been hurt too many times, and ive been lied to too many times...all i want now is for her to b happy and for me to b happy especially.   ...a week

						   Whats up folks, ive jus been wonderin about things cuz its jus confusin the hell out of me. She seemed happy this week but now im jus worried about her. She doesnt want to tell me anything, but thats ok i guess cuz its her decision. Im jus worried about her, cuz last time she was like this, we were both grieving and it wasnt pretty. ppl keep sayin that somethin good was suppose to happen to me, but right now im jus clueless, cuz nothin good has happened to me in a while...i jus dont know anymore...im always a step behind...and i always get burned about it. bye.

						   What up ya'll. Well last night i tried to find some answers cuz all ive been gettin was hints that somethin was good suppose to happen to me very soon, so i tried to get it out of some ppl. But all im getting is confusion and jus frustration, and im jus like, "what is the point of doing this, if it doesnt have to do with what i want??", but they still couldnt tell me, they jus to me to hang on. It jus bugs me that im not getting the things that i want to know, like everyone its keeping secrets about me from me. And it jus ticks me off sometimes. later.

						   what up folkz. Well im basically tired as hell right now. We've had freakin practice for 5 straight dayz and it sux ass. Well afta practice i basically jus chilled home fo a while, and then i hung at wit meeeeesh at his crib, cuz we were both bored.

						   What up folkz, i jus had practice today and stuff and yeah. anywayz i chilled at matts crib yesterday wit jizzy. We played some Texas Hold'em Poker, yeah...wasnt pretty fo me, haha, i lost all of my money. Yeah then when we usually about to hit the sack, we all talk about "guy" stuff, like girlz(fo us to know and u to find out), then we talked about vball. I basically gave matt and jeff like advice on all of there problemz and stuff that they b havin, cuz im a bro like that ya know, i like to help other ppl out when in need. Then we jus talked about the season, and we all agreed that season will b the greatest season ever, but the thing that we r like lackin right now, is the team aspect of it. Not everyone is on the same page on the team, some ppl have beef wit other ppl, so hopefully things will get brighter and everyone will coexist with each other. Then we talked about the next season fo the girlz...eeeeeeeee...not that good. Basically cuz its gonna b a new core group of girlz and the lack of experience and the will power of most of these girlz arent there, the only girlz i consider like wanting to win and kick ass is right now, wren and mikaela. Cuz those 2 in practice like bust there ass for everything and i like that in ppl, motivation to do whatever it takes to win. Speakin of wren, she freakin like called me at 11:00 at night, but its all good though except fo the fact matt and jeff were like sayin shit and makin me laugh. Yeah, and i shall make branlin that cd, all i need is the playlist though. Then finally we jus talked about pointless drills and vball like, montana to rice, the most pointless drill ever created, we dont run under the net, we dont catch the ball, we dont throw the ball, so what the hell ppl...COME ON!!!! yeah that was basically it. So i might post stuff lata, so...later dayz.  This Weekz Grade: A-  Insight: This week has been one of the best weekz ive had in a long time, im usually plagued with shit that gets me down and other stuff, but this week was pretty awesome.

Hhhhanywayz...practice was pretty tight i guess, cuz we didnt run that much and we played a shit load...i kicked some ass. Well afta practice, me,jizzy, matt, and assman went to go bowl it up. Since i havent played like in 5 months, i played like shit for 2 games. But then i started to pick it up, and i had 5 strikes in the last game, Matt jus basically kicked our asses and shit. Then we went to get some grub, so we stopped at...PANDA EXPRESS!!!W00T!!!...i had me some mutha fuckin orange mutha fuckin chicken....it was awesome.

						   Hey ppl who like to read about my life...well i jus had my last club tournament of the season, we finished 2nd and i guess everyone did pretty well. After the tournament, Dan handed out ballots for voting for mvp, most improved, and all that other stuff...yeah that didnt take very long for me, i basically put myself in every catagory except for most improved and i think one other one, but i forget. Hhhhanywayz, overall our team has come a long way from the beginning of season, especially the ppl that really sucked...like spencer, graeme, and joe(i guess). I guess i improved a lot on my hitting, but i greatly improved on my passing. I shall post u my final season stats as soon as i get them, cuz im coo like that. Well, as one season ends, another one begins, which is the Oxnard High School team. All i know is...we're gonna kick some ass this year...league is in the bag...cif championship is a very reachable goal, and i know that we can achieve it cuz our team kicks ass. So i guess the future does have its bright sides. Also my grades kick ass...2 Bz and 4 Az...FUCK YEAH!!...well i might post somethin later, but until then....the saga continues.

I know it sux and ur all like shes dumb...no shes not...she jus chooses what she wants and i cant change that. She has already chosen what to do and i know it sux but i cant change that, cuz i hate bein a selfish person and i want whats best for her. So ill post some otha ish manana after my tournament so...later.  ...Just remember that if you do go out with another guy, that i will always treat you better and i will be waiting for you.

						   what up ppl...well today im jus gonna probly jus chill at my house the whole day, but i might do somethin lata, but idk...yeah, i jus want to get the hell out of oxnard, i dont wanna b here anymore or anywhere close to here. I wish i was back at Japan, in the good ol dayz, but naw...im here and tryin to make the best of thingz. But that isnt even workin out...lately ive been on a slump in vball, i aint gettin the killz im use to gettin during the beginning of the season, but i have been gettin a lot of digz though. I jus have to push myself even harder to get the killz i used to get now, cuz they r startin to put like 2 or 3 blockerz on me, so i have to utilize my tipz and try to hit it in certain spotz instead of jus poundin the shit out of the ball and hittin it straight down, maybe against rio mesa i will get a chance to pound the ball, but against camarillo, it might b a little tough.   yea right...   urlLink Nobodyz Listenin

						   Yo my ppl...i shall break it down...  Friday... Well afta practice i decided to chill at mattz crib fo the night cuz we gotz a tourney manana. We talked about some certain thangz and i found out some new onez aswell...interesting...very interesting. Hhhhanywayz we went to topperz and chilled wit jizzy and ate some pizza...uh duh...yeah and we jus kicked it at mattz crib.  Saturday... Well we had a tourney so yeah...here it goes. Well we beat Santa Ynez, Newbury Park, and Almonty...but we lost to Mt. Carmel...GAHH!!!!...then we lost in playoffs in the first round to westlake...yeah...overall i thought we did alright, but i played like shit, cuz i wasnt gettin the killz that i was use to gettin, probly cuz they alwayz fuckin put 2 or sometimez 3 blockerz on my ass...r they that scared of me?...i guess so. Yeah then like afta the gamez against santa ynez and newbury park, i kinda took a walk and exploring the campus. I basically tried to think thingz through and tryin to figure out what am i gonna do with myself once all these thingz i have predicted happenz...i guess i will jus have to c or i will try to make the best of thingz. Then we lost in the 1st round of playoffz to westlake, it was close, but yeah...we lost. Afta the tourney i went to the habit wit jizzy, matt, davies, and mattz and jizzy'z folkz...then i went ova to joeyz party cuz it was his b-day.  Whatz on my mind... Well i hate whatz on my mind right now, i should b thinkin about other thingz instead of this shit, well at lunch when they were all together, i jus had to leave cuz i was like "i aint takin this infront of my face" so i did the reasonable thing and jus walked away...then matt gave me the low down, and i was like "yuh know, whatever makez them happy cuz i dont wanna get in the middle of this shit."...if theyre happy, ill b alright i guess, i jus have to get use to this shit, cuz i guess its gonna last...i jus want the best for everyone, i jus have to go back to my oldz wayz and try to find a way to b happy...hangin wit my friendz helped, but yeah...i jus have to deal wit this shit...lata.

						   To My Teammates...  During the Ventura Tournament, i was thinkin about how we r gonna play against these teams once we play them. Honestly, i think we have a chance to beat them but we could easily lose against these teams based on a few factors i have came up with...1. We have to be consistant...good teams alwayz seem to b consistant, they constantly keep the lead, the constantly keep on pushing themselves to win, and they constantly win period...2. We have to play smart...i know jon loves to pound the ball all the time and me and david do aswell, but we have to play smart against big teams, we have to know when or when not to tip, we have to find open spots on the court so that we could expose them and screw up the defense, and we have to know who to serve and what certain hitz hitterz like in order to stop them...3. We have to work harder...to tell u the truth, i havent been workin as hard as i should, so do some ppl on the team, they know who they r and they need to get their headz out of the cloud, we r not givin a championship...we earn one, and if we work hard day in and day out, we will come out on top garunteed, coach casey is right, we do need to work harder and we need to keep r headz in the game and win...Last but not least, 4. We have to play together...no one person is above the team, if someone makez a good play we have to b as hyped wit the play as they r, we have to support each other on and off the court, we have to maintain a special bond between us, and we have to put our differences aside. I can tell that someone has beef wit another teammate, they need to stop cryin and whinin about it and jus play the game and have a blast. Life sux, but vball is awesome and our teammates r awesome, so we must play together...those r my components in order to win league and win a cif championship...I know my role in this team and that is to put the ball away when it needz to b and also to pump everyone up and gettin them into the game, i know i get crazy a lot durin games, but its for a reason, i want to win...u dont know how much i hate losing, when we lose a drill in practice, i get omega pissed about it and that pushes me to do better and when we lose during scrimmages i jus get pissed. That 6-18 is omegaly gay, but i want everyone to get into it inorder to win, im tellin u guyz straight up...i luv u guyz, wit out u i wouldnt b the person that i am today, i luv playin wit u guyz and i luv the fact that we r on the same team and we're awesome. We have a chance to make a name for ourselves and bring our school the credibility and exposure it deserves...i dont like the fact that our school doesnt care or support i team and i hate the fact we dont get that much credit in the paperz, so if we win this championship then we might get the credit we truly deserve...aslong as we become consistant, play smarter, work hard, and play together, we will win that ring we all want...thnx for readin this...later dayz.

						   The Greatest Game So Far... Well we went up to S.B. at lunch and when we got there i was jus excited it was our first game. I was in a good mood, i went to taco bell, got some club chalupas, then went to the mexican supermarket and jacked some candies...hehe....B.A.K....Hhhanywayz me and leonard hung out the whole time basically...i sang the songs, he played it on the guitar...it was bitchen...we seronated alex with some john mayer..ooooooo shieeeeet...hhehe...it was tight...then at 7 the game started. The First game we lost 25-15...i felt that we were not gonna over come this at first, but i was determined to get an upset. Then we got back and won the 2nd game, 25-21, I got all stoked and i started to get all crazy...Then we lost the 3rd game 28-26, that got us kinda down, but we still had some left in us. Right off the bat, chris gets us 6 pts. on the 4th game and we ended up winning 25-20, i had many killz the whole night but my serves were like "eeeeeeeeeh"...So into the 5th and final game...it was back and forth the whole way, my heart was pumpin and i was tryin to calm myself down...then it was 14-13, one point away from victory...tom told me "charles hit a 3....ur gettin the set"...I was like aiiiight lets end this...then tom set the ball pretty low so all i could do was tip, they dug it up and played it out...i got a 2nd chance to hit, tom set it low again, but i tipped it into the right spot to win the match...it was one of the best feelings i ever had, i felt that we are finally got make somethin of ourselves this year...i actually felt...happy. It was the 1st time we ever beat santa barbara in history...it felt good to make history...i led the team with 14 killz and i had a few good stuffed blockz...so today was a good...very good day...lata

						   Omg...one hell of a match...this one is goin down in history...  The setup...oxnard vs. camarillo...for 1st place...the 1st game, we jus took it too em. They were missing a lot of serve and jus makin mistakez, and we jus took it too em 25-15. The 2nd game, we jus came out flat and jus didnt play up to our potential, vance was bangin and we jus made a hella a lot of mistakez...so we ended up losing 18-25. Since we lost, i guess our whole mentality was jus...blah...then the 3rd game was jus terror, we kept on gettin aced time and time again by eric and then our serving was very weak...especially at my part...so we ended up losing badly 15-25...down 2 gamez to 1...casey told us the "two bullz" story...and he actually got it right...hahahah. The the forth game it was time to turn it up. It was back and forth and our defense and our serving won it for us 25-20...then the final 5th game...were it all comez down to this...we ended up wit an early lead 6-4..then suddenly we messsed on  a few thingz and it was back to 6-8...then jus kill after kill...it ended up 13-14...a long rally began, and it took forever!!!!...then finally i some how managed to block corey and tied it up at 14z...then corey messed up on a tip that gave us the lead 15-14...then for match point...another long rally happened and finally on the 2nd ball, i tipped it down wit my left hand to win the match and ensure us of 1st place...i couldnt believe it...i was so stoked and i thought i was jus gonna break down and cry...but im saving those tearz for CIF...then a guy from star interviewed me, and i sounded all professional...hahah...well yeah...it was insane...payce.

Then we all went to the pepperdine game, wit the addition of annaliza, and yeah...off we went.

Then afta the game i spotted my fair share of hot chicz and then met up wit alfred and his folkz. Then we went to santa monica wit alfred, his famzleh, his friendz, and that one tall guy, #16, that was on his team. On the boardwalk at s.m. there were all kindz of sitez to c, and it was some good stuff. Then we all ate at cpk and it was pretty coo to meet all of these ppl, alfred'z dad thought annaliza was my g/f, which was some funny stuff, hahaha. Then we all went home and during this whole time out, i actually enjoyed myself and it was one of the best dayz i had in a long long time...well tomorrow im headed ova to the beach and play some vball and yeah...payce up...a town.

On the way there though, meeesh was goin about 79 milez/hour and the speed limit was 55, and a cop pulled us ova and gave him a ticket for speeding, so it was pretty rough. Then we got to the game and pepperdine lost the 1st match. Then freakin sean rooney or whateva jus dominated hawaii and won 3 straight. Alfred did pretty good but they made a lot of unforced errorz. Then yeah, im here, lata.

						   Well folkz herez my day so far. Well i had practice at 9 and i was hella tired from yesterday. I thought i was gonna collapse when i was peppering wit david. Then i started to get my flow back throughout practice, then we did this backrow hitting drill thing wit seniorz vs. juniorz, we kept on losing and then we switched up the teamz and i ended up setting for my team. It was bitchin cuz i set the ball pretty well and our team won, so i was excited. Then we scrimmaged and stuff, then at the end we did a "hit and go home" drill, and dan was leading it. It was soooo lame cuz i thought i was getting the coach on one, cuz all who was left was me and jon, then jon ended up gettin the coach on one and i was very relieved. Then some of us went to the beach and me and david were basically practicing cuz we're gonna b partnerz this summer. We beat mark and chris, but lost to dan and brian...i guess my beach game is comin back cuz i had a few good hitz, but i really need to work on my serving, and get my jump serve back in gear...U GOT SERVED!!!!...haha, inside joke. Well im gettin ready to go to watch alfred play ova at pepperdine, so ill post stuff later...payce up...a town.

It was a very laid back kinda practice in the early going cuz all we did was work on our hitting, then we did a "team-on-one" which was very crazy, and then we jus scrimmaged. Then at like 11:50 me and brian went to the beach to play wit dan, chris, mark and then dane and nick showed up, i played wit chris we got killed by brian and dan, yeah i suck at the beach now, its horrible. Then me and brian went wit dan to go to laguna high school to help him scout laguna and cate. When me and b showed up, they had...A LACROSSE GAME!!!! so we went ova there to watch and it was bad ass. This one foo got freakin body checked like crazy, it was awesome. Then i got a kick ass shit cuz i hit a chair ova during a drill and if we did we got a shirt, so i got the shirt, and we basically watched horrible volleyball the whole time. Then we stopped at the mall over there and me and b went to pac-sun and got 2 trucker hatz cuz they had a buy 1 get 1 free thing goin on, so it was bitchin. Then we went to girlz shoten practice at 7 and it was kinda alright. I won all the 2 man drillz i didnt want to run, but i almost didnt win when i was wit valeria cuz shez jus...GAH!!!!...yeah, but i still won it cuz i had enuff determination and anger left in me to play, so yeah...pretty good but busy day...payce outside.

I hit the chair and knocked it over, so i won a shirt...w00t!...then we had to hit from the outside, and mark hit the chair, but it didnt jus fall down, it like stayed tippin over for like forever, it was insane, but it fell down so he won a shirt. Then then we played 2 man the whole time, and i was paired up wit this one dude nick, who totally sux, and since i didnt want to run, we won both timez and it was kick ass.

						   What up ppl well today im goin ova to the beach and play a lil bit of some beach vball.

						   Well jus now i looked at todayz newzpaper at the sportz section, and it had this huuuuuuge article on boyz vball. It talkz about how boyz vball is growin and how its gettin better, but it still has itz weaknesses, like tryin to find ppl who actually wanna play the sport. Also it talkz about how we're favoritez to win CIF this year and about playerz gettin into Div. 1 or 2 collegez. Well all i can say is that year i guess our sport is gettin more exposure cuz of the attendence at gamez now, but it still needz a lot of work, like a program at middle schoolz and stuff. And about us winning CIF, i know we can do it but we jus got to get focused when it comez to big gamez and jus take em early and maintain our intensity throughout the whole match. And about gettin into a Div.1 or 2 school, i really wanna play in college and i wanna play at someplace here. I know i have the ability to get into a top school but i jus dont get enuff exposure and scoutz lookin at me and stuff, but im doin my best to try to get a full ride to some school, my backup right now is emmanuel, but i wanna go to a D. 1 school. So if we win CIF maybe i might jus get a chance to get into one of those colleges...worrrrd. Hopefully that will happen...later dayz.

						   me rambling again...  well in the movie, the butterfly effect, ashtonz kutcherz character went back through time and tried to save the one that he lovez and make her happy. Through all of the shit they both went through and through all of the thingz that greatly affected their livez, all he wanted was her happiness...and at the end, jus to do that in order to make her happy...damn...that almost made me cry, cuz it was soooooo powerful to do all that...jus to make one personz life the best they want it to be. Damn man, him jus doin all those thingz in the name of love and doin all that stuff in order to make his life better and make him a better person...is a beautifuly thing. His determination and his will makez me proud to b the person that i am today...i jus wish thingz turned out differently, but its life, and its all gooood. At the end of the movie, do make the decision he had to make...damn...that took a man wit heart to make that final decision...its a beautiful thing...its a very beautiful thing...

						   Ppl who r "in love" or think they r need to relax and jus go wit it. They usually get down on themselves a lot and think that everything is goin bad becuz it is their fault. I use to think like that, i use to b like, "y am i tryin cuz nothin is workin" or like "i think this life is pointless and i dont wanna b here anymore"...yeah...i had those feelinz. But they really need to jus relax and jus think everything is all good. They need to forgot all the negetive shit thats goin on and try to focus on the positivez, eventhough it may hurt, its worth it. Not everything is ur fault and not everything can b ur way, u jus have to deal wit it and try to live wit it. THATS LIFE PPL!!!...ur never get what u want all the time, u jus have to face the factz and try to make the best of thingz. Live life as it goes,jus live life one day at a time cuz its short so live it the best u can and try not to get down on urself all the time, tiz not good, but life will b good, u jus have to try to live it the best u can...later dayz

						   I HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGZ TIME!!! DAMN THOSE FARMERZ!!!...hhhanywayz yeah, this mornin i was all grouchy and shit cuz school is lame and i hate it to the max...well today actually went by kinda smoothy...im sorry that mrs. beyer'z mother in law died, i sent her my condolences, but yeah, today was awesome in her class cuz the final was a piece of cake. Yeah...vball practice was kinda tuff i guess, cuz of the new wash drill casey is usin, like its a game to 25 but how much the other team scorez is how many linez u owe and for the other team (non starterz) is how much they got beat by is how many linez they owe. So the 1st game we won 25-7, so we had to run 7 linez and they had to run 18, then i next game we won 25-19 so we had to run 19 linez which is omegaly gay, cuz i feel that running in vball is pointless, unless it is sprintz on the track or something, not freakin milez and shit...yeah, so we're gonna play channel islandz tomorrow ova thurrr, im disgraced cuz i though aznz were suppose to b tight at vball, but they suck though, so its time to teach those aznz how its really done ya hurrrrrrrrrd. well g2g, i might post stuff later...later dayzzzz

						   Wow tiz late, anywayz i must get stuff out...well ive been dealin wit pplz "relationship" problemz and such, from tryin to let go to the love triangle, im helpin all right now...but they jus gotz to realize, since all of this drama is happenin now...what is it gonna b like once u'r together??? but i know what its like, jus tryin to persue that someone that will make u happy and life will jus b great cuz ur wit that person, but sometimez it jus doesnt go ur way and i know it sux, but u jus have to deal wit it...thats life, everything is not suppose to b perfect and all happy-like, therez strugglez, battlez, losses, and heartzbroken...u jus have to build from those thingz, and grow up, through all of that stuff that has happened to me, ive made myself a stronger person, ive learned from these experiencez and made myself a better person and how did i do this...all by myself...yeah i give credit to the ppl who gave me advice and what not, but yeah, i chose what i chose...i dont need a significant other to b happy, i dont need to b loved back to b happy, i dont need all this shit that im goin through jus to make me happy...i can b w/o those thingz and still b happy, when i made that decision to move on and go where life takez me...I BECAME HAPPY!!!...then everything started goin well once i was thinkin positively...then i started to think im gold and that no one can touch me (soundz conceided) yea...it workz...so whatever u guyz do, jus think u dont need that other person to make u happy, u could make urself happy jus by saying "fuck u...im gonna kick some ass!" and bam...good thingz happen...but if success does happen wit that special person..thats its all good aswell...then thingz r really meant to b, but that rarely happenz, who knowz...maybe once they know ur gone, then they will start to realize that they have lossed...till then, time is the greatest healer, and time takez time, but time will go if u want it to go...later dayz  Much Love, ChArLeZ KeErAnAn ...ill b there when u need me...to all

						   Yo folkz, well today was the day that ive been waitin fo since last year and tuesday...cuz today was when the quarter finalz are to b played at ohs. well before the game, i was hella nervous cuz damn...i jus get buttafliez to the max. then the game began against sante fe...the black guy that was playin middle, blocked me a few timez, so i got pissed...i only probly had like 8 killz, but whateva, ill do what i have to do for the team. Jon and david had great gamez today...jeff was the man...hahaha..that foo should of gotten tiki, but i did cuz of that overpass kill. i swear, when i play my crappiest hittin wise, i get the tiki...haha. that number 5 guy was like my bitch from the back row, i dug that foo like almost everytime. well yeah...semifinalz folkz, we play orange lutheran, but we dont know where its at. Hopefully we'll find out by manana, but yeah...semiz...i more step in order to get to the finalz...history in the makin...payce.

						   yo ppl...well today, is pretty tirin cuz jus this whole week of practicin and practicin and practicin really takez its toll. Like im jus exhausted from all of the drillz and linez we do and jus tired. I can barely jump, and my armz r kinda weak...so i jus need to take it easy. well todayz practice was pretty good, we watched the video of sante fe and los altos play. personally, i think theyre not that good, they have one good outside but hez no eric vance...i mean, vance and fuckin pound the shit out of the ball, but this guy jus hitz the spotz and the rest of the team was jus like "alright". los altos though sucked ass, so i believe we could take them to 3 gamez. Our passing was very good today, suprisingly...so yeah john, alfred, and dan came, so it was coo. Tomorrow is a day that we should dominate...ive been to the quarterfinalz before, we started off wit a win in the 1st game, but it jus went downhill from there. If our passing is jus dead on tomorrow, it would b jus a cake walk. This year, after playin 2 seasons of club, that we could make history and go to the semifinalz and possibly to the finalz...so, its jus up to us...payce.

						   Pondering...  Well, I believe that u dont truly move on til u find someone else, i know that is the case. My feelinz for her, r not like what it use to b though. Like im coo wit all the flirtin and stuff and all that, but i jus dont want her hurt thats all...thats what i came up wit, i jus want her to b happy and i want her to find that special someone and i know i cannot do that. I jus want whatz best for her...protective-yes...while i was watchin Swingers, i could relate to the main character, Mike, in many wayz. His strugglez to live life, his depression concernin that girl that he loved left him, the struggle to get back to his old sef and try to move on. When he finally met that one girl, he totally forgot about his ex and totally started diggin this other girl, then finally his ex called him and rather talk to her he talkz to the new girl in his life...and that my friendz is a beautiful thing, when u forgot, u truly forget...i know i have no truly forgotten cuz im still talkin about this shit, but until that time comez, i must live my life.  Mike: Okay, so what if I don't want to give up on her? Rob: You don't call. Mike: But you said I don't call if I wanted to give up on her. Rob: Right. Mike: So I don't call either way? Rob: Right. Mike: So what's the difference? Rob: There is no difference right now. See, Mike, the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. But you can't do anything to make her want to come back. In fact, you can only do stuff to make her not want to come back. Mike: So the only difference is if I forget about her or just pretend to forget about her? Rob: Right. Mike: Well that sucks. Rob: Yeah, it sucks. Mike: So it's just like a retroactive decision, then? I mean I could, like, forget about her and then when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her? Rob: Right. Although probably more likely the opposite. Mike: What do you mean? Rob: I mean at first you're going to pretend to forget about her, you'll not call her, I don't know, whatever... but then eventually, you really will forget about her. Mike: Well what if she comes back first? Rob: Mmmm... see, that's the thing, is somehow they know not to come back until you really forget. Mike: There's the rub. Rob: There's the rub.   Rob: Those guys are right. You're money. Mike: Then why won't she call? Rob: She won't call because you left. She's got her own life to deal with and that's in New York. She's a sweet girl and I love her to pieces, but fuck her, man. You got to get on with your life. You've got to let go of the past Mikey, and when you do, the future is beautiful.

						   Yo foolz...long time no post. Well yesterday was pretty awesome cuz we jammed out of school early. We chilled at redondo beach and it was bitchen, i got me some new glasses that look like Bz but cost $6.50...w00t! Then jon bought a strawberry short cake kite, which was some funny shit. Then at the game, we jus murdered them...there was like no chance for them to win, we jus took care of business and did was we had to do. Today though i was tired and such, then at practice wit no food in my stomach, i wasnt doin that well. Well we play Santa Fe at our house on Friday, so it will b a good match cuz they kinda look like camarillo, so it will b fun. Well as for "chicz", idk man...sometimez those feelinz come back and i jus get down sometimez but after i saw Swingerz, which was a freakin awesome movie, i jus realized that im too good for that, so it was bitchin...payce.

						   This is a post sheerly out of boredom folkz. Well right now im jus watching "50 of the worst songz ever" or something like that on vh1. Some of these songz i actually liked, but some of these songz i cannot believe i liked...haha, as song taste change through time. I so want to b on those showz like "i love the 90s" or like something to where i could criticize the thingz i like and the thingz that r totally horrid, that would b the job for me. Then as i turn the channel to watch the laker game, i rememberd how i use to b such a laker fan, i mean when i was in japan jus representin the lakerz and all the haterz, it was good stuff. then as time took its toll, i began to jus not care about the lakerz, like if they win thats great and if they lose, sux for them. man, i loved living overseas, it was jus makin new friendz and like learnin new culturez and learnin the language, it was challenging yet worth while, i would love to experience those thingz again. Maybe, if vball takez me somewhere in the future, i might play overseas and do what i did in the past, that would b sooooooo awesome. Or i could jus b an english teacher and go to foreign countries and have my own class and teach...that would b awesome aswell. well ill leave on this note...bored bored bored bored bored bored...payce.

						   Yo folkz, well practice today was fun cuz alred, casey, and dan came. so when we scrimmage we actually had some ppl on the otherside of the net that can compete, haha. Well we jus found out we r playin west torrance ova at their place on tuesday. I heard they werent that strong but it all jus comez down to how we play against them. I guess right now its jus all mental cuz thatz the problem wit most of the guyz in our team. They try too hard and like try to make everything they do perfect, i admit i use to think like that but last nite i was soooo calm and confident, i barely made any mistakez. So hopefully jon'z knee healz, so that the 3 pronged attack can dominate once again vs. west torrance...payce.

						   1st round...  well it all startz now folkz...CIF Playoffz...1st round against montebello. my emotionz before the game were jus excitement, focused, and calm. All i need to b actually is jus calm ya know, cuz sometimez when i play i jus freak out and i have to make everything perfect...so all i did was jus stay calm throughout this match. In the 1st game i had like a shit load of killz, it was insane, there were no big guyz on the other team so i jus pounded the spotz where no body was at, we won 25-20. Then in the 2nd game, we jus knew we had this game if we jus stayed calm, "calm" in the key word of this post...haha, and jus took to em. On one set, it looked like the ball was goin over but Tom set a 1 to me and i jus drilled the shit out of it, it was fuckin awesome...we won 25-9. The third game i think we got a little overconfident, but we knew we had it, so we jus won the last game 25-18. In the end, Tom got the tiki, i think he deserved it cuz w/o him, i wouldnt of had my 17 killz, so i was happy for him. So now, the focus in on the 2nd round, after the game i was jus like "yeah...1st round...on to the next." I jus have to keep that mentality, its not ova...its not ova...payce.

						   Captainz blog 208...  well today was ok i guess...nothin bad, nothin really good, so it was alright. at lunch it was fun when we played cardz, we played spoonz wit penz so at one point when the game was ova i kept on playing and they didnt even tell me...foolz...well at vball we had to run 40 linez cuz we left a ball out yesterday...whatever, we alwayz run for dumb shit so what else is new. But the passing and hittin drill wit the serving machine we did improved from the other day we did it. Then when i got home i went to borderz and got me a biography on bernie mac and a dvd of comedy presents: jim brewer, so it was tight. this is all for the english project so yeah...get me to buy stuff about comedy is a good thing, hahaha. well tomorrow is the big day that we play montebello in the 1st round, supposebly they are a bunch of short aznz so yeah, its gonna b interesting...payce.

						   As I view the challengez ahead of me...  Playoffz...where i all comez down to...where all the hard work in club during the summer and the fall, and all of the beach practices i had...all that is for this moment, the moment where all of this season has led up to. Through our 1st win against s.b., through the battlez wit ventura and san marcos, through our 1st place finish at slo, through our huge battlez wit camarillo...it all comez down to this. Through all of the pain and shit i've been goin through leading up to this season and during the season...this is where i can truly take them out and unleash my fury upon my oppenentz. To me this season is the season of all seasonz, and to me this is the season where we r goin to make history. Win or Lose...im gettin something out of this. If we win C.I.F. this could b a key step to the road to euphoria and this could temporarely fill this emptiness inside of me for at least a year and it would bring pride and respect to our school. If we lose, its gonna feul me so much to wanna go back and win it, to me winning is everything...i hate to lose...trust me...i hate it...and this loss will motivate me and push me even harder to make myself the best player i can be...so either way...im gettin somethin out of it. League championz is fine and dandy...C.I.F. is what i truly want. Every i've played this season, i probly came out with jus 70% or 80% focus...playoffz...its been bumped up to 120%...to much focus can kill a guy...haha..but thats what im at...my last playoff experience was a memorable one...im gonna make this one an even better one...payce.  p.s. - check out "where i store my pictures" at the link column...new picz added

						   Yo ppl...well today was pretty stressful...i think im probly failin english cuz the cover page and application was crap. Plus she lost my essay on bein a stand-up comedian so i have to print that shit again...so yeah. Well practice was productive though, at the beginning casey took us to the team room and jus told us about what we needed to work on and jus play tuff in the playoffz. Then we jus did hittin linez i one of the 4z i hit was probly one of the best hitz i ever had...loco. Then blockin was a big part of practice so it was really good.

						   Well folkz today was putting away my problemz and my drama to rest and focus on better thingz. She wrote me back the letter tellin me we can b good friendz, she jus feelz uncomfortable bein around me cuz of the situation...but im puttin that to rest...its done...im not worryin about this shit no more...99 problemz but the bitch aint one...well in 5th period mr. brickey or however u spell it, gave us a presentation on his english teachin in japan...i was very interested becuz i really want to go back to japan cuz i really really loved it there...jus the safety and the ppl i was surrounded with was very special...i want that feelin back...well on the final game of the season against hueneme...well casey told us if they scored more than 10 pts in each game, hez gonna fuck us up tomorrow at practice...so yeah...we needed to play...we ended up beatin them 25-9, 25-8, 25-8...so yeah...its all good...laterz.

						   What up folkz, well i felt like shit (emotionally) today, maybe cuz i got the hint conserning this person. Well then at 3rd period i wrote her a letter sayin how i felt about the whole situation and what not, so yeah...then i had to leave at 5th period cuz i was "suppose" to go get a shot, so when we (me and mi madre) went to the doctorz office on base, i was greeted with screaming children and horrify soundz coming from those children...insane yes quite...this one kid had to b held down by 3 doctorz, muy loco...well then instead of takin only 1 shot, i had to take a total of 3...yes folkz...3 freakin shotz...well the 1st one was semi-painful, the put the needle under the skin of my forearm. Then the next 2 shotz were shot into my left and right shoulder...they were shot out of this crazy gun thingy, the one of the left didnt hurt at all, but the one of the right hurt like all mighty hell had been unleashed on my arm...so yeah...pretty sore...laterz.

						   What up folkz...well spanish we had a sub and we had to go to the big gym, it was pretty lame cuz we didnt do anything. So i went over to the other side to chill wit Darrell and David A. and i jus kept on lookin back to the section our class was sittin to c what she was doin...AHHH!!! im so pathetic...kill me now. Its pathetic when u get those feelinz at timez, u cant help them and when u try u jus want to jus b alone...it sux ass to the max. Yeah whateva, thats what happenz most of my dayz, jus worry and feelin pathetic...yup. Then on to the game, well my serving sucked ass to the max, but my hitz were ok and i had a couple of good blockz...so yeah...thats my life...the saga continues...

						   Ok well this is how it went...the  1st match  we had to play sports performance from st. louis or somewhere around that area...the 1st game, we win 25-17. I got a few aces, the other team made a lot of errors on their part, it was goin alright...the 2nd game though was a whole different story. We lost like 13-25, which was horrid...it seemz that when we win the 1st match, it gives us an excuse to play not as hard as we did in the 1st game...sorta like cuttin a lil slack. then the 3rd game i think we lost 7-15...overall, i think they were a good team, we jus had to play consistantly...our passes were a lil off and we jus needed to put the ball away... 2nd match  of the day, we had to plya asics mavs from probly texas, not sure though. The 1st game we jus get killed i think 13-25, and it happened again in the 2nd game...my hits were shit, like we were basically out of sync...then the 3rd match of the day we had to play the 4th(last) seeded team, cincinatti attack 18-2, from...cincinatti...uh duh!...anywayz, the 1st game we smashed them 25-13, everyone was doin a good job...then some how, that let down factor of ours jus came into effect...we lost the 2nd game 22-25...then we lost the 3rd game 13-15...it was jus the worse feelin ever...so basically we're not goin to play in the gold, silver, and bronze division and even flight 1 or 2...the most we can get is 3...3 ppl! 3!!!!...so its wack to the max...my feelin the whole day was, jus try to do ur job and then everything will somehow come...like a year ago, i jus thought "if i got a kill, then im spent!"...now i know i can get the kills, i jus have to b consistant and take it to the next level...i jus havent had a game this season that i was really really into it...the only game that i remember me bein sooooo into it, out of both club seasons and high school, is the game against camarillo at home...but since then im jus not like all giddy about vball...i jus need to find someway to get me back in that mode...but if we're losin, it jus sucks cuz i hate to lose...PERIOD!...its the lamest thing ever...well close to it...but yeah. I jus need to b more consistant and hit the ball harder...i jus have to work on that over the summer i guess...well my plans now is hopefully goin to c the us national team play russia and talkin to my g/f...payce

						   Since im bored and i have nothin else to do, i decided to look at other ppl(strangers)'s blogz to c what their story is...it lookz like a lot of these ppl use blogs as basic form of expression or as a personal journal until they reach a certain goal. One girl's blog was a quest to lose 120 lbs. by 2005, thats interesting...1 guy'z blog was makin a movie and his adventures in cali since he lived in michigan...interesting...so yeah, most of these blogz aren't jus journals of pplz, its basically a search or a way to express themselves to share wit others...minez use to b like that, i dont think anybody other than oxnard ppl read my blog...but yeah, my search is over, and now i jus use this blog to type up what i did today and what not, and what my feelinz r, and how much i love my g/f...yup, pretty boring stuff if u ask me...and y do u ppl read the stuff that i write...who knowz...but don't worry folkz...someday the saga will come back again, then all the drama and other shit will start and then this damn blog will have a purpose once again...but right now, im jus gonna enjoy life and enjoy it wit my special g/f and the other ppl who are a great part of my life...maybe i should start a blog seein if i can gain 120 lbs. by 2005, haha, that would b really really interesting then...but i can, cuz yeah, vball makez me lose the weight once or if i gain it...if u have any ideas how to make my blog seem interesting jus e-mail me at ckeer3@hotmail.com or jus tag up my board or something...but right now i guess its pretty borin stuff to u ppl...but yeah...jus hollar...payce!

						   =D  Well today was a very productive day so far. I thought i didnt have a ride to the beach cuz jon had to go to practice, but david saved my life...THNX HOMEZ!!!...so when we got there, steph told me that theyre not commin til 2:30, and it was 2:05, so i asked her if we could go to her house...so yeah...when we got there she said we have to go back to the beach, haha. so me and david went back to the beach and when we got there, we were waitin forever, then steph and them showed up around 2:40 or so, but they had to pick up jake aswell so dave dropped me off, and then they all finally got there, hehe. So we jus walked around the place and didnt know where to go, so we decided to go to jakes house...paulina was so paranoid that her mom was gonna see her, and her mom has a white van, and we saw a shit load of white vanz and jake kept on pointin them out, so that was funny. Then we made a pit stop to this one park place and we rode the swings, i havent rode swingz in a long ass time, and then when we got to jakes house, we turned back cuz it was almost time to go...haha. So then when i went to the parkin lot where david was...i asked stephanie out...and she said...YES!!!...hehe, so now im really happy...so that was my day so far...and that closes episode 3 folkz...the saga was basically devised cuz it was basicallhy the search for that special somebody and the search for happiness...so i guess the saga is basically...done...i have found the road to euphoria...and im takin it head on...later on

And I think that we r gonna go to the beach tomorrow...so that will b fun...=D. Also practice today was pretty good i must say. I think the new thing we're doin when after every play we will come together in the middle of the court and do a lil cheer thingy...its coo...well hopefully tomorrow goes as planned...until then...the saga continuez

						   Yo ppl...well right now im jus pretty bored cuz there is nothin to do around my house except play wit the kidz cuz my mom runz a day care. I wanna do somethin wit steph but damn practice...dude, i didnt even know we had practice yesterday...wtf!?!...i talked to dan yesterday, but he didnt mention practice to me and it said on the schedule that there was no practice monday and tuesday...soooooooo lame...i mean the schedule is use for something...so i guess i jus to ask everyday when practice is...that will piss ppl off cuz they will b like "look at the schedule!!!" and ill b like "o yeah the schedule...that didnt say that there was practice on tuesday...o the schedule that tellz when all the practices are...man, i guess the tuesday we had practice was written in invisible ink"...but yeah, its gonna b over once j.o.'s r done...thnk the lord...but lately the bright side is that ive been gettin a lot of sleep in, so im happy about that...it feelz good to wake up at 11:30 a.m...itz bitchin...well i think we have practice today...based on the "all-knowing" schedule...so i best get in my vball mode...payce outside

						   well hello there ppl...so howz ur summer goin so far?...great, glad to hear. Well today or should i say tonite my cousins r comin ova for dinner, so thats gonna b fun cuz theyre soooo coooo, hehe. Well i might call steph up later, to c what she is up to and if maybe we could c what day would b a good time to go on a date or somethin fun. well so far the summer has gone really slowly since im not playin vball right now, haha, so its jus movin in a slow pace...hopefully it picks up once j.o.'s is over, cuz once thats over then i basically have time to do anything i want to do, which is great...payce outside folkz

						    Vball post...   Well i'm jus thinkin about my future with this sport. During the classic tourney, i guess i didnt put that much effort into playin...i need to get back in my focused mode. Hopefully at Junior Olympics, i can really show the college scouts what i can really do...i just have to work harder at the next few practices before j.o.'s. I'm really considering goin to emmanuel to play there, but first ill c what opportunities i will have once the summer is over...then i will make my decision about where i am goin to play in college. I really would like to play opposite hitter cuz at classic, i had a higher hitting percentage hittin from the opposite than hitting from the middle and outside. Also this could give me an opportunity to get more blocks and become a release if brian needz help. But mainly i jus need to b focused on vball at j.o.'s...100%. After the matches are over, then ill think of other stuff. But when we're playin, i jus have to think about "doin what i know i can do, dont overdo it, jus play, have fun."...thats all i got to think. Also, concerning about the team, we jus need to stop freakin out and stop tryin to overdo thingz...jus play the game on a steady tempo and realize our tendancies...i know minez already(can't hit over the block, hittin middle back, not bending my elbow, not pressin on blockin sometimez, and other thingz)...i jus need to work on tryin to correct them during the next few dayz...so until them...the saga continuez...

						   Well well well...it has been about...4 dayz since i have posted or so...so i shall break it down to u day by day...hear it goes...   Friday  Ah yesssss...the last day of school. Excited...not really. Ready to get it over with...hell yes...Well all i had to take was my spanish final, i thought to myself "shoot, i did pretty damn good last time when i didnt study, well i think its gonna b like that again."...i was wrong...DEAD wrong...the first part of the test was conjugation...lame to the max, i didnt know any of it...then the 2nd part of the test was multiple choice...i think i did alright, but yeah...i hate spanish to the max...then me and b headed off to anahiem to c if we still have a chance to play in a match. So when we got there, it was the last match of the day...we ended up losing and we ended up getting 4th in our poolits a bad thing...then me, b, nick, and john went off to motel 6 and got us a hotel...we got 2 roomz and there r 4 ppl in each room, supposebly. Then me, andy, and brian went to the mall cuz i forgot a headband at home and i needed one cuz my hair getz all crazy when i play in gamez...then we watched "Dodgeball", which i must say was a hilarious move...kicked ass...then we headed back and went to bizzed.    Saturday  Well, we started off the day bright and early...about 6:15ish...what a way to start off the summer huh kid!?!....haha. Well we were in an ok pool i guess...not really, haha. Well our first game was against smbc 18s silver...they werent that strong, so we beat them easily in 2...then we played virginia coastal...we lost in that game, jus the mistakez we make during the games this tourney is what killed us...then we played amazon 18-1s...we beat them in 3 games...then after the tourney me, andy, john, matt, and brian went to hooterz and grubbed. Then we went to a different mall and hung out there for a bit...i went B.A.K. at pac-sun...haha. Then we headed back to the tourney cuz we had to play a challenge bracket against club wood...we lost in 2, which sucked. Then we headed back to the hotel and i talked to stephanie, which was big relief cuz i missed her and i needed someone else to talk to besides the team, its good hearin her sweet voice aswell. =)...and that was my saturday.   Sunday  Well this was our last chance for pool play. Well the 1st match we had to play was jus a scrimmage cuz the other team forfieted cuz they didnt have enuff playerz to play. The 2nd match we beat SCVC, we kicked there buttz pretty badly...then we played mustangz and we beat them in 2...so we got first, so that was a relief, dan was pretty kick back today...maybe cuz hez fed up wit our crap i guess. Brian today had troubles setting the middles, so i couldnt really do anything wit the setz...i got frustrated about that. Then after wordz we went back to our hotel...good stuff back at the hotel...brianz ball across the street...mangina...HAHAHAHAHA!...then we went to downtown disney for a bit and headed to the mall, but it was closed, so we ate a cpk...i told the guyz some jokez...and about the angry dragon...hahahahaha, good stuff good stuff. And we went back to the hotel and chilled.   TODAY  Well today we had playoffs and it was a single match elimination. Our first, and final, match was against yucaipa, or somethin like that. The 1st game was wack, brian did a good job setting, i jus sucked ass and hitted it into the block a shit load of timez, so we lost. The 2nd game, we won, i did a good job serving and hitting. The 3rd game we lost...yeah...after the match, some of the guyz went to in-and-out...spencer freakin tried to order a cup of water via drive thru...haha, it was sooo funny. Then me, brain, and andy went to santa monica and walked around on 3rd street. I went B.A.K. at urban outfitterz...i like these glasses, hahaha. Then now im here...tired, thinkin bout steph, thinkin bout j.o.s, and thinkin about my kick ass summer...payce outside!

						   Well since i probly wont blog on friday...i guess ill make this post my end of the school year post...yup, this will basically explain this whole school year in my point of view...enjoy...  Well this year, must been a crappy school year...also the longest. During the beginning of the year, life was jus something i thought about when im extremely bored...like love...When i finally got that feelin, i thought it was the greatest thing in the world and nothing can go wrong...but it did, everything that i could imagine went wrong...but i kept on tryin. I kept on fighting for what i believed in, for what i thought was right, for what i thought was the best for both of us...but the pain jus kept on building up until i finally was on the brink of doing something terrible to myself...but i kept on tryin...my mind and my heart kept on having battles, i want to believe in one thing but then i try to do another. Throughout this year, i have been living in depression, sadness, and anger...i thought my life was meaningless and hopeless...i thought the fighter inside of me died and became cursed...it was a stage that i will never forget, it was a stage that i have learned greatly from...even when i tried to let go...the feelinz somehow find its way to linger back in my heart and effect the mind...when vball season began...it was another battle for me to face. On the court, no one could touch me, i couldnt b blocked, i couldnt b dug, i was a monster that didnt care about anything except for destroyin my opponent...then once im off the court, i was the most vulnerable person in the world...my happiness after winning a big game quickly turned into the worst depression i have felt...throughout this season, we have experienced some big successes and for the moment i felt happy about them, but then afterwardz i jus dwelled on my depression and my patheticness and wishing that i would b wit her...wishing that somethign were to happen to turn my entire outlook of life around...i needed a savior...when we went into the playoffz, i have decided to ignore those feelinz until the season is over...for 3 weekz, we have had great successes...i having 17 killz against montebello, having 11 killz against west torrance, having 9 killz against sante fe, and finally having 12 killz against orange lutheran...after when the last ball hit the floor and gave orange lutheran the beginning, the first thing that ran in my head was..."damn...its over...its finally over". It meant that the next day, i have to face those problemz again...i cried...it was a sad day...i thought that nothing good is ever going to happen to me...i thought that, "now its jus pointless to continue...vball is over". It was one of my lowest pointz, but then something that i least suspected happened...the following thursday, i started talkin to stephanie online...since i had nothing to lose, i gave it a shot...then we started talkin somemore and it became on of the most happiest momentz ever...then for like 3 or 4 weekz now...we started to know each other better and i began to really like her...then it jus hit me...my feelinz for that one girl were gone...they disappeared, and now the are all focused on stephanie...the first thing that went in my head "man, hopefully the bad doesnt come again...or else i would lose it."...but it didnt come...everyday my feelinz for steph grew stronger and everyday i began to get happier...when i thought life was pointless, she came to me...she saved me from my dispear...and i thank her greatly for that...now, im the happiest person ever man...its feelz so great...and she also has the same feelinz for me...and its a beautiful thing...from the worst thing that can happen, to the best thing that can happen...this year was full of upz and downz and full of suprises...so to wrap this up...this year was the crappiest year ever!...but it had a hell of a great ending...love ya ppl for bein there to support me this year and thnx for all the help, i hope my experiences and my advice were helpful in ur time in need...thnx for still bein my friend even if my stubborness over took me...haha...i especially thnk stephanie...for finally rescuing me from this curse that i have thought i would never get rid of...but u helped me do it...love u...have a great summer ya'll!...o yeah...the saga continuez...

						   ONLY 1 MORE DAY OF SCHOOL LEFT!!! Well today, i thought, was the day that is gonna suck most cuz i had my u.s. history and english final to take...the u.s. history final was actually pretty easy, i knew the thingz that he put up on the board and i think i did a good job. Then i had my english final next, all i needed was 150/300 to get a B, but i ended up gettin a 340/300 and yeah...its awesome...well idk if im gonna go to practice tonite, so yeah...well all i have tomorrow is spanish and i think im just gonna settle for a C cuz i suck at spanish, haha.

						   Yo ppl...well at the beginning of club practice, dan gave us a lecture on how he was disresepected last practice and such...idk what went down exactly but dang, he took it really hard...i thought he was gonna cry, but he held it in. Then he talked about work ethic and how everyone hasnt work hard enuff...yeah i know i havent worked to my potential and i know i can do better, im jus worried about my teammates mentality cuz i want our team to b successful...then he started talkin about pplz drama and stuff, mostly from the girlz team. I dont give a shit about the drama that the girlz team have, i dont give a shit really about drama period...its a stupid thing that everyone goes through, they jus have to build a bridge and get over that shit. Anywayz, we did some run-through drillz and a couple of ppl got coach-on-onez and a lil bit of hitting. My hitting is suckin hardcore, so i need to work on that once finalz r over cuz i have to study so i can keep the grades that i want or get the grades i want. Well tomorrow is probly my tuffest day for finalz, so i best get to the studyin...the saga continuez

And we also ate popcorn and goofed off...so 2 classes down...4 more to go...imma c if i could take my u.s. history final during 6th period so i wont miss the tourny on friday, i guess i have some studying to do tonite...and i have to study for english, all i need though is like a 50% on it to get a B...so its all good...payce outside!

						   Sup folkz, well 4 more dayz til school is over!...tiz awesome yes, but today at 6th period, the vball ppl had to dress out and stuff, so it was pretty gay. What increased the gayness was we had to run 40 linez cuz ppl dont know how to follow directionz, im not blamin anyone cuz we all did it and we're all dumbasses. Then 5th period we didnt do anything except play cardz and stuff, but i made my own yearbook, its bitchin. I say who needz to spend $60 on a yearbook when u can make ur own...haha. But yeah, i passed it around and almost everybody in the class signed it. 2nd period was pretty lame cuz we had to watch a borin ass movie. I learned that i needed 75/100 to get a B in that class, so i best get studyin and kick ass on the final. 1st period was gay aswell...i hate spanish...that sayz it all. My favorite comment on my yearbook belonged to stephanie, *to steph* no, i never get bored cuz im alwayz wit u...:D...hehe. so that was my day, hopefully tomorrow will pass by as quickly as possible. Not sure if im gonna go to practice cuz i need to start studyin inorder to maintain or get the grades that i want...payce outside.

						   Sup folkz, well today i was suppose to go to beach practice but i had to spend time wit my family. Speaking of vball, i think i've made up my mind about where to take this in the future...but that matter will not b discussed until after the summer season. Only a selected few know what i'm talkin about so i'll leave it in their handz not to talk about it at the moment cuz it would b awkward if many found out about it...Well next week is the last week of school and that is jus the greatest thing ever! hehe. I want this year to end in a good way, and have the most enjoyable summer ever!...hehe, well my main man cody bowen jus called me up a few momentz ago and imma chill at his house for a bit and steph is gonna b there, so its gonna b sweeeeet...hehe...payce outside folkz.

						   Pathetic...  Hmmmm...seemz to me that when ppl try to let go, they tend to try to make the person that they tried to get jealous to make them think "damn...i could of been wit that person...i miss that person soooo much." Its funny how this world workz at times, ppl think their way is right or ppl try to make what they believe in happen...there is a reason that everything happenz the way it does...life is jus a big lesson, its a road system that everyone takes...every road is not perfect, ur gonna go through a lot of bumpz and a lot of pot holez in this road that u chose to take, but it either endz in a fiasco or a success...either way, at the end of each road there is a lesson learned, and then u can take new paths and make new mistakez and make new thingz happen. But there r some ppl who go backwardz and look back and go back to those roads. Goin back and lookin back ledz to pain and u facin the same problemz over again, its jus gonna happen again and again and again...i was like this once...lookin back, tryin to solve what i needed to do to be happy, or i thought that would lead to my ultimate happiness. I use to b like "omg...if im wit her im gonna b happy forever!"...it doesnt work that way, u have to keep movin on and keep lookin for the better thingz that life has to offer...u cant fall in the same traps again or vice versa...its times like these that i felt pathetic, lost, confused, sad and depressed...then finally...i took another road, a new road...a much better road...im still on this road, the road that has led me to stephanie...the more i walked on this road, the more my feelinz increased for steph...i am greatful that she came into my life and showed me a new way to look at thingz...thnx steph, u mean so much to me, its unbelievable..:D...so the lesson that i have learned through the way is that there r better thingz that u may not believe, but when it happenz...then it hitz u...and its an awesome feeling...but ppl have to learn from their mistakez...even if they have to let them happen again...all im sayin is that ppl shouldnt look back or go back to pplz trapz cuz ur going to get hurt...again...but its not my choice, u ppl have to make ur own decisionz...even if its the wrong onez...i feel that the past right now is a repeating for some ppl(u know who u guyz r), but its pathetic that ppl want to repeat the past and jus want some action instead of the whole package...and all of this to make a certain someone jealous...and how do i know this and how do i come up wit all of these answerz...cuz im that damn good...well whatever u guyz do, so b it...i am happy now, im so glad that my feelinz for stephanie are strong and i am thankful that she feelz the sam e way about me, and i dont want to go back to the past...i jus want to continue on this road and see where it takez me...and im lovin every moment of it...payce outside.

						   Well about my day...i had a tourney, we didnt do that well. We lost all of our matches and got last place in our pool. We kept on making some key mistakes, aswell as some stupid onez...but yeah, i didnt play particullarly well, probly cuz im tired and exhausted. My killz were alright, only a few were down ballz wit power, my passing was ok...some games im off and some games im on...w/e, if dan getz pissed at me for bein inconsistant...so be it, i cant b perfect and play really well all the damn time. Especially when im exhausted all the time, and i jus dont feel like practicing or even playin vball in that matter. Vball is jus not my favorite thing to do right now...im jus lookin forward to my summer and lookin forward to spending more time wit stephanie...thats how i feel right now...great! but burnt out aswell...later

						   O yeah...forgot to say some otha stuff concernin my day...well me, jizzy, and matt went to las posas road to check out the casket of ronald reagan...it was pretty breath-takin seein his casket go by and seein all of his family in the cars. Then about 6th period...ill jus tell the truth, im tired of hidin it...the girlz suck really bad. I mean they cant even run 2 linez on time!!!! *cough* meagan *cough*...i mean shit, if u cant do it, then its gonna piss me off...and im not that pissed that often, but lately vball has jus been gettin on my last nerve...then we had to scrimmage the varsity girlz...i mean damn...they need some serious help...no joke...they cant pass, they cant hit, they cant do anything!...wtf!...and this is varsity for cryin out loud...we beat them 25-9, 25-10...and we could only hit backrow and tip when we r at front row...HOW EASY DO WE HAVE TO B ON THESE GIRLZ!...i think they need to get use to us poundin the ball in the front row and stuff, so when they play bigger competition, they will b ready. I mean damn...they cant do anything!...my God b with them this season. And im jus fed up wit vball in general right now folkz...im not diggin it lately...i mean im sooooo burnt out. Like everyday when i go to practice im like, "y am i here?...y do i put up wit pplz stupidity and stubborness?"...i want this summer vacation to b the most enjoyable summer ever!...all i really want to do is hang out wit stephanie, have a blast wit my friendz, and relaxin. Stephanie is the only one keepin me sane right now...and i am blessed that i met her and for all the thingz that are happenin between us right now...:D...i jus really need a break to get rest, get my competative spirit back, and start to like vball again...cuz right now...its not on my top 5 thingz i want to do...so yeah...thats my opinion...and if u have a problem wit it, then live wit it cuz i dont care what u ppl say...im sayin what needz to b said...live wit it!...payce outside!

Then my tipz were tipz of fury...haha, i would jus snap my wrist and the ball would jus go straight down...at one point of the match i was called for a back row attack...WHEN I AM FRONT ROW!!!...i mean damn...how easy do we have to b on these girlz man...they arent that good, they need to see some firepower and then when they play regular girlz then they could dig up everyball and kick ass, but naw...we have to take it easy on them...w/e...aint my season...well banquet/talent show tonite...tiz gonna b fun...payce outside.

						   Well yesterday i decided to take a break from vball cuz my thighs r sore and my back, so here i am. Today i took my senior pics, it was coo. I jus got there and 15 minutes later i was done...quick and easy. Tomorrow though, im back to my daily dose of vball...starting with probly a day at the beach for a while, then im goin over to the gym at 12:30 or so to do part 2 of my recruitment tape. I still need to show more of my hitting skills and maybe do some passing aswell...payce.

						   w00t!...post number  300 !     Recruitment tape: Part 1     Well at 12:30 me, dan, alfred, mike, mark, and jake got into the gym. We jus hit around for a while so i could warm up for the 1st fragment of the hitting part. Well first off we started of with a prayer...yes we needed as much help as possible...so we started to shoot the video. I had to hit a few outside hits, then i had to hit a few middle sets, mostly 2's. Dan wanted to redue it, so we started over again. The 2nd time through, i did much better on the outside, so we moved on to the middle hits again. I hit a few 2's, then i moved on to hitting 1's and 3's...and that was it for the day. I looked at the video, i thought i did pretty well, a few of my hits were really good, but i needed a bit more work on it...i guess we will do that on friday. So i did a pretty good job today.    Right now, im pretty sore from all of the practicing...my thighs r worked and my back is really sore...i guess i need to take the day off tomorrow to chill...but after that day, im right back to vball, cuz i want to achieve a dream...this weekend im goin to b attending a vball camp at Pacific University, its up at stockton. Hopefully i will learn a few things so i could get my hitting really down and my all around game...I saw her today, outside of the gym...i kinda felt a lil sad and stuff cuz yeah...w/e, i jus have to live with that for now...that was my day...payce.

						   Well tomorrow i'm goin to definately make my video. Today, dan jus said that we were jus gonna jus tune up a bit prior to the video so we didn't really do any shooting. Alfred helped me a bit at practice with passing, but it was pretty stressful cuz i've been use to the form of passing that i was taught and its hard to convert to another form that quickly, so i jus have to try to pass well with my crap form...haha. I really want to play for Hawaii, Alfred said that i can definately make the team if i jus tried out as a walk on next season...but the tape will, hopefully, secure a spot on the team instead of having to try out. Alfred and Dan told me that i really have to work hard, so that i can improve my game once college comes around...Overall, i would love to play with Alfred at hawaii, eventhough i'm only goin to play with him his senior year. Jus playin for a great D-1 college team and living in a paradise that i want to live in, its totally awesome. I don't want to get confident  and say that i've already made it, i haven't yet. But i want to work hard and improve so i could b a top player at the college level...and i believe i can do it. It's gonna b tuff along the way though, so i jus have to keep at it and do the best that i can...i mean so far this summer i played at the beach almost everyday, also playin at oxnard almost everyday...the more i touch the ball, the more i will improve along the way. But thats my main focus for the rest of the year...secure a spot at the vball team at Hawaii U....payce outside.

						   Well this week has been very tough for me i guess folkz. I thought my future with steph was gonna b great and awesome, but i guess its not gonna happen. For a few dayz i delt with the break-up pretty badly, i was jus sad and stuff and i jus couldn't stop thinking about her. But vball has really helped a lot lately, what use to b something that i dreaded doin in the early part of the summer, now is helping me cope with my breakup and makin me happy. Like i have a good chance of bein accepted to play at the University of Hawaii cuz i'm goin make a recruitment tape for alfred so that he could give to his coach. And my playing has improved, especially my hitting...Beach has helped me a lot with that. So the time that i usual spend, bein sad, is now spend getting better at vball so that i can achieve my dreams...it suckz that things between me and steph had to b this way, she is a great person and i guess we jus didn't know each other that well to go out in the first place, so i'm not totally bummed really, jus a tad bit. But im glad that vball is goin so well, hopefully i will play my best tomorrow so that when the coach from Hawaii sees it, then he will b impressed. I hope that God is with me tomorrow, that would b a big help.  I guess bein single is not too bad...so i'll leave with that...payce.

						   Well last nite, i went to jon's house to lose all my money, i mean play poker...i ended up bein the 2nd person to get eliminated from the table, the handz i got were all crap. It's either one high card and one low card. Then i jus sat around and watched tv...then before i went to sleep, it was hard listenin to my dashboard confessional cd cuz i would alwayz think of her while i'm listenin to it...then i jus broke down and jus let it all out wit tears...it sux, but its somethin i had to do cuz it helps release everything for a moment...or the nite. I ended up writing 2 songs and i thought of a melody in my head, if i only i could play the guitar or have a program to make music on this computer...i guess i have to find one then. I had a dream that nite aswell, that me and her started to get to know each other more, and hangin out more...weird but yeah...then this mornin i e-mailed her about how i felt and how sorry i was about not telling her about my "drinking" incident...hopefully she writes back and then i will know what to do with myself and if i should let go or try again...i don't want this to end up like my last drama case, but yeah...later.

						   well...it was good while it lasted...  yeah...steph jus broke up wit me about a few minutes ago...ya know, w/e...she said that we like didnt really know each other that well and we were jus labeled as g/f and b/f. She also found out about the nite when i got totally wasted...she said she would of understood if i told her and what not...but i jus wanted to protect her cuz i thought that i would dissapoint her...but yeah...it's over, im now back to my single self again. right now i feel a bit relieved and stuff, but at the same time i jus feel like shit and sad cuz i thought that better thingz were goin to happen wit each other in the future...but i guess i was wrong...again...well now i jus have i guess move on and try not to let this shit get me down...damn...payce...

						    Beach Tourney at S.B.     Well last nite, me and david decided that we should go to the beach tourney at East Beach in S.B. today. When we got there we saw Dax Holdren and a bunch of other players practicin and what not. Only 4 teams played in the 18s bracket, including me and david...on our first match, we didn't do so well in the beginning. We were losing 13-18 until the player on the other team got injured, so the match had to b postponed. Our next match was against Andrew and Ric from S.B. High. We lost to them 21-19, 21-18...very close match i might say. Then we had to play against Chase and his partner(i forgot his name) also from S.B. High. We ended up beating them 21-19, 21-15...they made a lot of errors, and thats y we basically won the 2nd game. Then since the 1st match we played was postponed, and the guy that was injured is fine again, we had to restart that match and play it out again...we won the 1st game 21-19, then we lost the 2nd game 15-21...so we had to play a 3rd and final game...the sand was so freakin hot today, my feet are practically burnt. So then we won the 3rd game 15-12...and since we won that game, we got to play in the championship match against Andrew and Ric...and we played them right after we won against the other ppl...so me and dave were hella tired.

						     This happenz when i'm bored!       &nbsp;   my take on our governors comments       &nbsp; well well well...i guess ppl jus can't handle pathetic 1st grade insults from our austrian "orgy-lovin" governor. I mean its silly how ppl can get offended when someone calls them a "girly-man". Here, ill jus perform a dialogue about this childish insult on some random person...here we go... &nbsp; Arnold: You know what!?!...u r a "girrrly-man" Bill: OMG!...DID U JUST CALL ME A "GIRLY-MAN"!?! Arnold: Yes...I did...SO WATCHU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT!?! Bill:...I'm jus gonna cry cuz those was the most hurtful words that i have ever heard in my life! (Bill Starts to Cry) Bill: I DEMAND AN APOLOGY! &nbsp; and scene... &nbsp; come on folkz...i mean "poo poo head" is a better insult than girly man in my opinion...ppl these dayz...can't take the little thingz that come at them...i mean these ppl r adults and all they do is jus get offended by creative insults by our governor...yes, i said creative as a form of sarcasm...if u don't know what sarcasm is...then u should go to school more often...so for all of the ppl that were offended by arnold's comments...go fuck urself...payce &nbsp; &nbsp; now u see what happenz when im bored...foolz   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   Well yesterday worked out alright i guess, cuz me and david ended up getting 3rd in our pool. The 2 teams we lost to were pretty damn good, but we could of beatin one of them though. Jon and Buck got, i think, 5th overall, which is not that bad, but Jon said he could of done better wit Curtis. It was freakin hot at Manhattan though, i could barely walk cuz the sand was like steppin on fire like in fear factor or somethin, hehe. Today i went to best buy and i got the spiderman 2 soundtrack that recently came out a&nbsp;few weeks ago. So far, it's really good cuz most of the bands i like (Dashboard Confessional, Yellowcard, Hoobastank, etc.) are in this album...so i'm glad that i bought it. Well i'm not sure if me and david are gonna compete in the beach j.o.'s cuz i think that we're too late to submit the money and the form to compete cuz on the site it said that it was due on the 20th, but when david registered it said that it was due on the 16th...2 days ago. So i'm not sure whats goin on right now. This week, or next week or w/e, i'm goin to make a vball recruitment video so that alfred could give it to the coach at the university of hawaii to see, so that i can have a chance at playing in hawaii...which would b totally awesome. And this friday it will b 1 month since i asked stephanie to b my g/f...=)...but its tuff cuz we don't get to see each other that much cuz school is out...so school bein out can work as a negetive and a positive...o the irony. But yeah...crazyness...payce out folkz.

						   Well i today was a very productive day, vball wise. At 4:30, the guyz that came to the ohs girlz practice jus played games and what not. I had alfred, dan, mike(alfred's friend), jason, chris, and jake on my team...we played a total of 4 games i think...during the last game though my hitting was pretty impressive...if only i had mike setting during both club and high school season, that would b awesome cuz he sets awesome...after we played, alfred wanted me to get a video of my playin so he can show that to his coach, and this could b the ticket for me playin vball at a D-1 college, which is totally awesome to the max! So hopefully everything goes to plan, and then next year i will b attending the University of Hawaii...w0rd. Tomorrow me and dave are goin to playin at a beach tourney in Manhattan beach. Hopefully we will do well cuz i think this is jus our 2nd week playin together, so hopefully we will kick ass...i miss steph, it kinda sux during the summer cuz i don't get to see her that often cuz we don't have school right now. She said that her sis is comin over to visit this weekend so hopefully we will have an opportunity to see each other next week...i hope...payce.

						    My Decision...     Well, i have thought long and hard about my decision on which club to go to next season or if i should stay with shoten or jus not play club at all. I've weighed my pros and cons for each of these different outcomes if i decide to do them...its like if i go to this club, then i dont get the same treatment as for this club and if i go to this club, then i our team won't win as many games/matches. One club benifits what fits for my goals as a team...but one club benifits what fits for my goals as an individual...cuz the main reason y i considered leavin shoten is becuz i want to b on a  "team" . I wanted all of my teammates to know their roles and know what they r doin and jus get the job done...i don't have that at shoten right now. But some players r makin the extra effort into improving and working hard to get what they want to get accomplished. I know my efforts this summer during club season wasn't the best cuz after losing in the semi's in high school really made me bitter about vball cuz during the past club seasons, my goal coming to high school was winning C.I.F...but that jus didnt happen...and it sux cuz i've worked hard for what i wanted to get done, but now its all down the drain...and i have to start all over again...and thats the same goal coming into the next high school season...to win C.I.F...eventhough we lost tom and jon...im gonna work even harder to get the job done cuz its basically up to me, david, and brian...the rest are there jus to fill the spots and get the job done...we have to work extra hard to make thingz happen. I've realized my weaknesses and my strong points...i know what i need to work on and i don't think other clubs will help me wit my weaknesses...so i've decided to stay with shoten...for the fall season for sure...no yet decided once the summer season comes. I'm gonna stick wit the same guyz that i've played wit in the past 2 years...and im gonna try my best to improve as a player and to improve my team's "unity" i guess...cuz i don't want to b the only one gettin the job done...i want everyone to do their job and get it done...and thats my decision.     Decision: Staying with Shoten

						    My take on the trade wit shaq and those guyz that were in miami...   Well all i have to say is...o well for the lakerz...yanno, shaq is the man. He jus dominates the inside and jus runz over ppl. He brought the lakerz to 4 out of 5 nba championships, and winning 3 of them...now the lakerz got pot-head lamar odom, caron butler(hez alright), and brian grant(another old guy), and aswell as a 1st-round draft pick...which is like the 27th pick. I think that the lakerz should of got someone or some other ppl than the playerz from the heat...like maybe yao ming and some other guy that is tight...or 2 ppl that r tight...idk about the rocketz, all i know is they gotz yao ming and t-mac. Thats my input on the shaq trade...   On kobe's upcoming choice (lakers or clippers...hmmmm???)   Well if kobe goes to the clips...hez gonna play wit the crap of the crap...even though the clippers cleared space in their roster and promised kobe that they r gonna play a few games in anaheim, doesnt mean the clippers is a good choice...if kobe goes for the lakerz, he will b the leader on this team. I think that kobe is a great player, no doubt...but to b the greatest, in my opinion, if kobe made his teammates look good in the next few seasons, he will b the greatest player of all time man. But if he does go wit the clips, cheap ticketz, im down like a clown. But i think he should stay wit the lakerz.

						   Well folkz...i wasted 2 hourz of my life a few minutes ago...  Ok...here it goes...first off my sis told me that i had health as a summer school class, so i missed the 1st day. Then today, i went to school thinkin that, "well i better get this over with instead of takin it for a whole semester."...so i got in the class, mr. hartman or w/e didnt call out my name and i told him that i missed the 1st day...so he was like "ok, go get ur book at the textbook room." so now im at the textbook room and im waitin in this long as line and this bitch teacher is not doin a damn thing to get the bookz, so it was takin forever...now gettin a little impatient, this one girl from my class gave me my backpack and told me to go to the front office and get a ticket to resign back in the class cuz i was dropped...yes, dropped from that fuckin class...so i go over there thinkin to myself, "ok, w/e, ill jus get back in the class and get my book and its all good."...little did i know i had to wait in another long as line wit a bunch of gangsta mexicans...this one dude jus got out of juvi for cryin out loud...and hearin "foo" after everysentence for about 40 minutes isn't helpin either...so finally im infront of the consulor, cuz thats what the ticket is for, and im about to resign in the class...she tellz me its full, so im  like "im a senior, i need this class to graduate", then she tellz me "well too bad, u have to take it during the regular school year"...so now i am overly pissed to the max...omegaly pissed...pissed beyond pissed...wasting 2 hourz that i could of spend sleepin or playin vball...wakin up at fuckin 7 in the fuckin mornin for no apparent reason, and waiting in those fuckin lines wit all these ppl jus so i could get dropped out of the class and they could tell me about it...fuck school...fuck oxnard...fuckin payce!

						   Well ppl, today was the last day of j.o.'s. The 1st match we had to play against the cincinatti attack team that we lost to on the 1st day. We beat them the 1st game pretty easily, then we lost to them in the 2nd game...again. I got so pissed off cuz this team totally sux cock, theyre pathetic. So i was pretty intense in the 3rd game, and sure enuff we won...so then we were off to the flight 4 finals against the flyers from chicago. They beat us the 1st game 25-23...then the 2nd game was insane and we pulled it off wit a win 31-29...then we lost a big lead and lost 13-15...so that was the last match of the season, it is both relieving and sad at the same time. Playin wit Chris and Mitch for the last time is kinda sad cuz those guyz r awesome, im gonna miss playin wit them to the max. Its relieving cuz now my official summer will start. Now i can do the things that i want to do...hang out wit my g/f, learn how to play the guitar, and im probly gonna play a lil bit more vball to keep my game in top form...and go to the weightroom, haha. So yeah...its ova. We leave Austin at 11:00 a.m. and we should get back at around 4:30ish or 5ish...that i have time to c the fireworkz, yipee! I miss steph to the max man, when i go to bed and when i listen to my music...i am alwayz thinkin of her...im so glad that shez my g/f...=D...payce outside folkz!

						   Yo folkz, welcome to day 3 of my junior olympic trip in austin, texas...so far we have not been doin well. Today we were in a 3 team pool so its alright cuz we have to get out a bit earlier than usual. In our 1st match of the day, we had to play SAVBA(team from san antonio). All i can say is...we whooped their asses pretty badly...i forgot the score...but it was bad for them. But our 2nd match we had to play club Opiona'a or something like that(theyre from hawaii)...at the beginning of the match they gave us sea shelled necklaces and macadamian nutz...so theyre my favorite team of the j.o.'s cuz they gave us free stuff...haha. But we lost to them in 2...it was close, but we jus couldnt keep our lead...like alwayz...so we lost. Then after that, we went to the mall for a bit and then went back to our hotels. Well tomorrow is the last day of competition. We have playoffs at 12:00 and that would b it, we're goin to play in the flight 4 playoffs...basically the crap of the crap playin to win...pretty lame i must say...then im headin home for the 4th..w00 h00! I can't wait to c steph again...payce outside!

						   Sup foolz...well today was day 2 of the junior olympics at austin, texas. Well first off, we went to the convention center around 6:30ish...then we found out that were suppose to play at 3:00 p.m...so yeah...i jus woke up at 6:00 for nothing, w/e though, thats life. So we stayed there for a lil bit, i talked to jon mason for a bit and then we jus jammed...we went back to the hotel, and i took a nap and it felt hella good. So anyways on to our 1st match; we played the 4th seeded team called beach boys...we lost the match cuz i guess we were tired and we were jus out of it as alwayz...then our 2nd match was against mPower...yes...mPower...the 1st match we won 25-20, then the 2nd game we lost 23-25...then the 3rd game, we won 15-13...i think it was one of the best matches we have ever played in, everyone was talkin and everyone was havin fun...it was pretty awesome...well that all went down the drain in the 3rd match against yucaipa...again...we lost in 2...it was lame...thats all i gots to say...so today was alright...cuz we won, and yeah. Then we went to jack in the box where the most funniest shit happens...ok, lemme tell u guyz about austin...they are a shit load of hobos/homeless ppl there...no joke, they freakin beg in the freeway or at a stop light...well here it goes, spencer(chris' bro) found a hobo sign in front of jack in the box. So he was jus standin outside lookin like a hobo and trippin everywhere...ppl were honkin at him, it was hiillllllarious. Then we all went out there and like beated him up infront of all the cars and stuff, and ppl were stoppin and lookin...this guy drove by to protect spencer...it was comedy...pictures will b shown on monday(if i feel like it)...then after that, we went back to our hotel...talked to stephanie, ran outside into the hallway in my underwear, only, and now im here...and that was my day...payce!

						   Open gym today was kinda lame...cuz my playing after the camp has been crap...the beach was an excuse cuz i haven't played on it in like a week, but indoors...i should b doin better. I had some good moments, a few good hits and passes here or there, but mostly it was crap...chad though was playin like he had never stepped on a court before, i give credit to him for comin and tryin to do the best he can but he jus needs to learn all the little things before he can play wit us...like reading where the ball is goin, stop jumping while he's passing, lead his passing with his shoulders not arms, have a faster reaction time, i can go on and on...i mean practicing non-stop is what i do, and i basically learn something new everyday...but yeah, he has a lot to learn. But hopefully he doesnt stress over it, i had to go through that when i was his age, but w/e...he'll b fine. Well hopefully next week i will continue wit my recruitment video for hawaii and other colleges...but mainly hawaii. Hopefully God is with me through out the week and bless me to play the best i can...hehe. Well i guess all i have to do is get out of this funk i've been having lately...i'm probly jus stressin out too much and gettin pissed easily...idk...i'll get over it. So the only  "problem"  that i am concerned about it is vball...payce.

I love helpin u ppl out, but if i don't want u to help me then fuckin stop tellin me that i need help and i need someone to help me...i will repeat this til the day that i no longer use this blog, "i made this blog for the purpose of myself, if u guyz read it, its all good in the hood. But if u try to help me, i'm fine with that. But if i don't want to b helped, then build a bridge and get over it cuz i ain't goin to fuckin explain whats the proble"...i like u ppl ya know, u guyz r very important to me, but whoever this "a" person is, he/she should fuckin go get a life cuz he/she can't even run his/her life, and this person tries to tell me what to do...fuck that...payce.  p.s. "a" person- if u tell me who u r, that will show more respect...but i still hate u...payce.

It seems like they want to try to figure me out or something, u ppl jus need to back off jus a bit. I don't ask u for ur problems, u guyz jus come to me...i don't say "if u have problems, jus tell them to me", im not like that. If u need help, im happy to help. But if u want to help me, then i will tell u that i need help...thats how it works.  don't question my power...payce.

						   its 12:20 in the mornin...not really wantin to go to sleep but feelin the droziness of fatigue...life so far this summer has its moments...its funny how one thing gets better and the other thing is jus all gone downhill...not really funny, but yeah. When i first met steph, vball went down to hell...then when she broke up wit me, vball seemed to b whats best for me. I guess life jus has to have balance and i have to deal with w/e comes to me...it sux though...i can't get 2 good things at the same time. Yeah im happy that i have a chance to play at hawaii, and other d-1 schools, but at times like these i jus get lonely.  Plus, senior year is comin up...my last year of sweet high school bliss and the joy of not having the responsible to an adult quite yet...bein free to choose what u want to b when u grow up and what u want in the future, freely thinkin of all the great outcomes end in 2005 for me and my fellow seniors at oxnard high. My plan so far after high school is to go to hawaii and play vball there and major in either art or music...even another major...idk. Finally gettin out of oxnard is a blessing and a sad reality...i'm never goin to c some of the ppl that i have been growin up wit these last 4 years...if only i could go back to when i was a freshman and live what i have been through so far would b a blast. W/e...hopefully my senior year will b the best one at oxnard high.  Don't worry about me ppl, i basically do these posts jus out of pure boredom, cuz when im bored i think too much and then i think about the negetives...which is not a good thing.  Right now...im not sure if i want to b in a relationship anytime soon or at least persue one. becuz of this balance, i don't want anything to interfear with the success i've been having lately at vball...all i am willing to do right now is working hard at what i love to do and getting something great out of it, like a scholarship. If something does come up unexpectedly, girl wise, then w/e...i jus have to c what happenz...and try not to fall in too deep this time. I jus don't want to fall into the same mistakes that i have made with relationships or do those things cuz its me alwayz gettin ended up wit the bad news...fuck you.  done wit my boredom ramblings...payce.

						   Yo ppl, well i jus got back from the University of Pacific at 3 in the mornin, and here is how my trip/camp went...   Day 1  Well first off Nick picked me up at around 9:45 and we went to moorpark to pick up mark and sean and to meet up wit dan. It was a long 5 hour drive and at a gas station, which was an hour away from Stockton, dan told us that we had to get ready to play cuz chads mom said that the 1st day of camp was actually today and not tomorrow cuz we thought today we were jus suppose to check in. So when we got there, we jus went to the dorms for a bit then we started playin at the 3rd(last) session of the day. It was coo, only like about 50 players were there total and we basically did a few warm up drills, then passin drills and what not. There was a camp helper there named Al Johnson, we jus call him Al, he was a coo guy from the start, he told me he liked the way i played the game cuz i show a lot of passion when i play...so it was coo. We started scrimmaging the last our of the session, then at 9 it ended...me, mark, nick, sean, and other ppl ended up stayin til 10 cuz we jus hit and stuff...then it was lights out at 11.   Day 2  The 2nd day i woke up and my thighs were a bit sore cuz they have been sore for like a week now. The 1st session started at 8:30 and the plan of today was jus splittin up into different positions...i went wit the outsides cuz thats what i wanted to b, duh. Dan, another dan(hez tall as heck, 6'8)...we told us how to hit cross court and then angle and then blocking from the left side. Then towards the end, dan sent me, mark, and 2 other outsides to play in the upper gym, there r 2 courts in the pac gym and there is one at the top floor but in a different building, and we were put into teams...i did alright passing and what not, my hitting wasn't as good though. Then the session ended at 11:30 and we headed to lunch. At 2:30 we headed back to the gym and started the 2nd session. The guyz from the top gym, including me and mark, had to go play at the gym wit the sports court for the 2nd session. All we did were some wash drills...i got to know some of the players, brett the kick ass setter from cal central, nick this lil dude thats a hot head but can bang, patrick an opposite from diablo valley, hunter a middle from bay to bay, then ppl from chicago...yes i said it...chicago...Well during the wash drills, i did a pretty good job digging balls and hitting aswell. I hit a lot of cut shots, which i like never do, so i was a bit proud. Then our 2nd session ended and headed to dinner. We got back at the gym at 6:30 for our last session of the day...We basically jus got into teams again and jus scrimmaged the whole time...it was fun...on one note, before sessions Al makes us do these crazy drills, like passing the ball to each person wit our legs and doin other stupid stuff, i call them "Al's pointless drills that actually warm me up".   Day 3  Today i woke up sore as all-mighty hell. Sore basically today during the beginning of each session i was jus groachy and jus didnt want to play...but i manage after every session to find the strength and stay for a while to hit. We basically did the same thing what we did yesterday but some drills we did were a bit different. Players that play for Pacific U. help wit the camp and sometimes play wit us and stuff. When we scrimmaged though, the team i was alwayz wit was stacked cuz it consisted of all the best players from the and most of my team was over 6'1, except for lil nick.   Day 4  Well today was the last day of camp, it was sad cuz i'm gonna miss the guyz that i've been playin wit for these 4 dayz. 1st off we went to the weight room for a bit and stuff, then we went back to the gym where john, head coach of Pacific vball, talked about how to get to play here and other colleges, what u needed and what it takes...then at the last session we had to tournament...our team was Russia, cuz all the teams were named after international teams, so our cheer would b "AH MUTHA LAND!!!"...haha, end of the world. During the tourny we did a good job, i actually hit the ball over the block and it would jus b straight down.  Pat did a good job hitting, that fool can freakin bang, then everyone did a good job wit their part...especially brett, that homeboy can set...at the end, my team won the tourney and we got shirts and dan, my coach, told us to do Al's stair thing...cuz each section of seats at the gym were lettered, and we had to spell our name...we basically we had to run up the stairs, touch the letter, then run back, and spell ur name out. So i had to spell out my full name, Charles Randall Keeranan, and it took a hella long time...In the end, Al told me that i was a wonderful player and he wants to c what college i go to in the future, A lot of the players always appreciated me cuz i was such a good player and all that, so it was very nice. On the drive home, we basically listened to Dashboard Confessional, which dan now is in love with...haha, and other ppl...we talked about the history of shoten and about colleges and what not, i told dan that i wouln't mind if i was a recruited walk-on for hawaii and stuff and dan said that alfred is probly gonna convince his coach and stuff and i have a good chance of getting into hawaii, and if i work hard til the fall season, then i would probly b a contender for a scholarship. When we got to ojai, it was jus scary as hell, cuz it was at night and in the freakin wood areas near a haunted school...scary shit...and now im home...   Overall  Well, during this whole trip i had a really really good time. I learned a lot of stuff and i got back to the form that i wanted to b in...i can actually hit over the block and cut the ball and make things happen for my team. The guys at the camp were great and so was the coaching staff...especially Al, that guy is my homey...and it was a very fun trip.   Quotes to remember  "ACTIONS SPEAKS LOUDERS THAN WORDS!"...me copyin dan...haha "Is this switchfoot?" "Seans talkin shit again"...."SEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!" "SHUT YOUR FACE N****! SHUT YOUR FACE!" "This Song is the story of my life" *Dan's facial expressions* ....and others  now back to hard work...late
