      Well today was fun. I laughed a lot. I really love to laugh you always know it's a good laugh when your abs start to hurt or maybe that's form laughing too much who knows. Well there it 18 days left of my last summer in high school. I can't wait to get back to school I miss it. I know some people are going to say I'm crazy for wanting to go back to school but that's ok.   I finally used up my underwater camera I hope my mom doesn't forget tomorrow because I can't wait to see them they're going to be really funny.   well I guess I'll go but don't forget to stay classy.

      Hi guys! Well this past weekend I went with Janice and her family to New Branufels it was a lot of fun. I almost died in the rapids that was fun. And I miss my boy! Today I was at my dad's house and me and my step brothers watched the X games. It was so cool. All I have to say is that  Chuck Carothers  landed a kick ass trick and took the gold. There is a picture under this. That's him. Later guys peace out!

      Well last night was fun. Poor Cooper dog got bit by a snake or snakes 3 times his front right paw all the way up to his shoulder was swollen it looked like a lion paw it was very sad. It's about 11:45 pm when I let him and saw his foot so I called my brother to tell what happened he was in downtown Houston and hour and a half away. I had to walk down to the Meyer's house to get Dustin to help me pick Cooper up and put him in the truck. Then had to ride in the back of the truck to the emergency vet clinic. it just so happened that Dr. Hablinski, Cooper's vet, as well as our pets vet, was there that night (his very good I recommend him). He took care of Cooper and come to find out that there was 4 other snake bites that night and another on the way. So the snakes were busy last night. Don't worry he's doing very well and has been in the litter box a few times so he's a whole lot better. Hear is a pictures that I took of his foot today.  urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v433/meccabeanyo/pict0002.jpg

I discovered, with help from a friend, Windows Movie Maker it is the most amazing thing in the world I love it like no other. I've made two movies/slideshow one for Jenny and one for Janice they are the best. This weekend I helped Jenny feed the animals at our neighbor's little farm so I'm going to share some of the pictures I took. This is of the teenage chickens:  urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v433/meccabeanyo/on%20the20farm/teenagechicken.jpg  This is of the really hyper dog I would tell you his name but I forgot, sorry:  urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v433/meccabeanyo/on%20the%20farm/hyperdog.jpg  This one is of the horse and a little of Janice:  urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v433/meccabeanyo/on%20the%20farm/horse.jpg  This is me if I lived on a farm:  urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v433/meccabeanyo/on%20the%20farm/CowgirlBecca.jpg  So there you go my weekend being a farm hand.

We were a little late because of the Puddle Mudd/3 doors down/nickleback concert there was on parking so we had to go to almost the other side on the mall but me made it and we had to sit in the very front row and the people looked really funny. I did have more to say but I forgot that sucks, huh? Maybe it will come to me later. So uh peace out ya'll!       Woot! I remember. So I was wondering what the M in M. Night Shyamalanâ€™s name stands for I think it something simple like Mike: Mike Night Shyamalan. I like it. It works. You guys can come up with whatever you want as long as it starts with an M.      Guess what hapened today in history. Captain Juan Antonio Perez de Almazan, the commander of San Antonio de Bexar Presidio, presided over the first election in Texas History. Isn't that nice.
