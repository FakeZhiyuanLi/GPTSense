       MONTHLY WARNING   Amanda and other parties assume no responsibility in the viewing parties contracting the following side effects of viewing this page: an open mind, new insight, and/or super head-explody. If you have any problems, please do call 1-800-GET-REAL and my flying monkeys will assist you with any problems you have. Thank you and enjoy the flight!    To get things started, I'm Amanda. Most people know me as...Amanda. I have many, many names beyond Amanda. Such as...Big Red. Or Sno-cone. Even Manders has a place upon the names. Or if I'm in a bad mood, it's usually "You Bitch!" See? People answer to more things than one thing.  I am fifteen. I moved practically across the U.S. about a year ago. But it's all good. I'm alive and enjoying life and enjoying everything around me...except the nasty smelling air...DAMN YOU HOUSTON!! *shakes fist*  I am not your normal person. Heh, I'm much more cool!...kidding kidding...but seriously, I'm not your everyday, simpleton, plain Jane. No..I have a mind and I think for myself. And that's good.   I've invited three of me best friends ever to join in on writing this blog. I seriously doubt they'll all turn me down...well...at least I HOPE not...Caleb, who also has a blog. I post on his...hee hee. And Kista, who lives back in meh home town and who is the first person to introduce me to Achaea, and adicting MUD game. Aaand, then there's Nats. She's my one of my bestestestestest friends ever. I wub her to deaf! So, if you ever see a post that is somewhat sane...then you'll know it's one of those three, and not me.   Life is not as bad as it seems. Sure, things bad come our way. But they can't be that bad. Carpe Diem. Seize the Day.  I always see people groaning on and on about how life is too hard, too boring, or too depressing. I say, "Then get a life."  You should be happy that you are on this earth, with all its problems and all of its bad things...but there's more to it than that.   Yesterday in World Geography, our teacher was going around telling people what he thought of them. He loves all of our class, yes...but my teacher said, "Amanda over there...she's an angel. She loves and enjoys life, this class, and this school."  Considering I'm the class outcast to the students, that came as a really good surprise to me.  I got up in front of that class the first day and was told to give the class some information about myself. I remember doing that like it was yesterday.  He had some questions on the overhead projector. Some were "Where were you born?" "How old are you?" "What kind of music do you listen to?" "What are your religious preferences?"...I didn't mind a single one of those questions that he asked.  I stood up, being the first person on the roll, I had to go first.  "My name's Amanda. I'm fifteen years old and I was born in Nashville, Tennessee." I went on  to explain that I'd just moved to Houston a month earlier and that I had not yet adjusted to the place I was living in. I told them about the first month of moving...me missing my home..and my friends. And I told them that I'd noticed that this place was a Church town...and I assumed the majority of people were of some kind of Christian religion...which they were. I smiled and politely told them about my Pagan beliefs. "OH! So that means you can like put a little spell on the opposing soccer team next weekend so we'll win, right?" said my teacher kiddingly. They stared at me kinda funny and that sealed my exile contract. But, My teacher kept smiling the entire time I was talking.In response to my teacher's question, I brought up Karma and how I live my life by the rule of threefold. Someone asked what that was and I explained that whatever I do will come back on me threefold...or even more...depending on what I do. And that I'm finally over being so angry and sad at everything and that I'm going to make the best of being here.  He grinned and nodded and said that he's glad to know that someone as nice as me was in his class.   The point of all this is that I'm okay with being across the country...it's an experience, let me tell you that. I'm still not used to everything. Kids don't roll houses, they wrap them. And there are no freaks or hicks here...there's bangers and kickers. It's all so confusing.   So, a little bit about me... Like I said, I'm not your typical person.  I'm a weirdo who listens to whatever music you hand me...unless it's frickin Britney Spears...who I think should quit her career (if you can call it that) so that little girls would stop dressing like whores.  I'm a relative gaming Newbie. Ah, the joys of learning! But that's okay. I like learning! Whee! I don't talk like normal person. I use words like peachy, spiffy, nifty, oi, and woot! Oh, let's not forget the new word for today...Swell. I am Queen of many things. And I am Mistress of Flying Monkeys. If anyone disagrees, they are attacked with flying monkey banana peels. You have been warned.  Well, now that you know a bit that runs through my deranged mind, go on..play nice...and tell yer friends!

      Chillin' back, hangin' out, and listening to some Nirvana. Life is good. Boyfriend gone, eye on possible prospect(s), and doing Caleb a life-saving favor. Play over, no more rehearsal...missing peoples...missing the cute upperclassman Assistant Directors that is...hee hee..boy crazy is bad.  Did the governent intentionally make Easter Sunday on 4/20? I mean, do you realise how much a conflict it is going to make with the pot-smoking Christians out there? Granted, there aren't many...but I live in the place with top schools and tons of druggies. It sucks.  Until next time, adios muchachas. Clean Girly, Manders, Solitary Boycotter of 4/20

       Super Stressed  Do you know how much of a pain in the arse it is to put on eyeliner and then take it off? It hurts. Like a biatch. And then when you go buy the remover for eye make-up so you don't have to worry about stinging your eyes with the normal cleanser stuff, it ends up burning your eyes just as much AND it doesn't get the eyeliner off.  Damn you Theatre rules...damn you.  So, this month's warning is about the dangers of make-up.    In order to keep a lawsuit from knocking on her door, Amanda suggests that one never uses eyeliner unless he/she is well experienced peoples who can handle poking their eyes with semi-sharp, wooden objects that write on your skin. Also, if one were to be crazy enough to do this, experienced or not, do not use any kind of remover to get the black crap out of your eyes. Simple warm water and a soft washcloth works better, and hurts less. Please refer to the monkeys if you have any problems. Thank you.

       Frantic  Hullo Blog,  At the moment, I'm a bit busy...erm, I'm clicking the Connect button on the Java client at about the speed a hummingbird beats its wings, hoping that  urlLink Imperian  will open up at noon, like it was advertised to on the  urlLink board.   SO! Apart from that, I'm at school, lost in my thoughts. An hour ago I was momentarily interrupted to take a Biology test. So now I'm back to the thought stuff. Whee!  -Dice Squirrel

      It's a sad story to tell when you go blonde. But you can't go blonde because the dye in your hair was maroon at some point...and the blondeness turned light red.   Spongebob is the bomb. Simply put. Who wouldn't adore a short, square, holey man who can play the flute with his nose?  I need to find something to warn you folks on for this month...

       I mean, no shit. They really do.   Honest!  Anyhoo, I maintain my pearly alabaster finish by doing not much at all, other than MUDding, studying, and reading. A lot. By a lot, I mean, take a really big number, and double it. That's half of a lot. -That's- how much. Nyah.  -Squirrel

      Caleb... I know.   and I have a warning for the month of July! Woot!    So to avoid many people in the hospital, burnt tear ducts, blistery skin...and to promote the sunscreen market, Amanda suggests that one does not swim eight ours in direct sunlight without sunscreen. This will result in a lobster-like appearance. Also,  doing so, could cause intense, stinging pain. If you have tanned skin and don't burn, do not heed to this waring...but...when you look like a rattlesnake...don't come to my monkeys...it's your fault that you were stupid enough to stay outside for so god damned long. BUT...for all you other folks, excluding African-Americans, those of Hispanic or Latino heritage, or the aformentioned lucky folks who tan, do NOT stay in the sun for a long time without sunscreen. It hurts.    Oh, and from now on..my name is...Panda! Woohoo!   =Panda

      You know...it's been bloody forever since I've been on this blog. Jesus. FOREVER... SO long in fact, that I have been on a blog period, that Caleb took me off of his. Which makes me sad. But I'm not going to take him off of mine. Because I'm just nice like that.  I was at Dancin' in the District Saturday night. I got to see Fuel, Magna Fi, and The Clarks. There was another band, but they blew, so I won't mention them.  I do believe that I am part of The Shallom Revolution beginning here in Mt. Juliet Tennessee at a lovely music club called Cafe Express. We are believers in God. We are 'Christian'. But we do not whore out the term to make money. We are here to fight out the ideas of 'different is bad' and that you must look and act a certain way to believe in god and that Christ is your savior. We're the ones who are breaking down the boundaries of religion and are here to accept anyone who wishes to join.   I started up with it because I never felt comfortable in a church. Well, my new church is held in a music club. We are young people who have a passion for their beliefs..and are there to speak and to listen and to let the Lord God speak through us and into other people. We don't, I repeat, we don't want to push religion down someone's throat. But if you were to ask, I'll say. We walk in love to the degree that we can. Our enemy is the syndicated, whored-out industry that religion falling under the name of Christian has become. That's what we all want to change. That's what I want to change.   Granted, I am moving to North Carolina within the next week and will not be able to attend meetings anymore. But i will be updated..and I will spread the word of the revolution to people in North Carolina. It's what I want..it's what I need..and it is a calling that I have come to answer.   Heh...No apologies for the rant there. I needed to say those things. Even if no one reads them, at least I know they're out there. And that there's a chance that someone may say, "Hey..y'know..that's pretty cool" and ask me about it.  I've changed a bit since I even last posted. I don't think I'm nearly as hyper as I used to be...but then again....i've been through a lot since then.   Attempted suicide, parents nearly splitting up, moving again, and the constant wondering about God and where He has a place in my life. At least one of those has been settled.  I'm starting my Junior year of Highschool on August sixth of this year. And I'll be starting it in North Irdell High School in NC. I hope to have a GLSEN chapter open (What? GLSEN? Christian? HUH? I believe in equality. I live a lifestyle of love and acceptance and support of those who need to be supported.) and hopefully spread the Revolution to some folks.   This should be interesting...seeing as I definately will be posting more often.  God Bless.

       wow..   I've moved to North Carolina. My only computer access is the computer with the sticking keys at my dad's work place that I'm having to deal with right now...and my contacts are itching and I forgot the solution. Pout.
