       I've had this gift card for $50 to the Mohegan Sun   since May and I finally spent it today.&nbsp; I got this alarm clock/themometer thingie from the Discovery Channel Store, and man, is it neat-o.&nbsp; One of my seldom publicized obsessions is with weather.&nbsp; Dorky, I know.&nbsp; I used to watch the Weather Channel, not just to get the local stats, but to see what the weather was like in other parts of the country.&nbsp; Storm Stories?&nbsp; Love it.&nbsp; So this...contraption tells you the indoor and outdoor temperatures, the time, and you can use it as an alarm clock.&nbsp; It also has this cool projection thingie which projects the time onto the ceiling.&nbsp; Wowzers.&nbsp; I'm psyched.&nbsp; My sister and I also got my aunt, who just got a new puppy, this picture frame thing where on one side you put a picture of the dog and on the other side goes a pawprint of the dog.&nbsp; She was very happy with it.&nbsp; Her other dog, Gwen, passed away on Tuesday, and she was REALLY attached to her.&nbsp; So now we have Robbie, who is a Sheltie just like Gwen was.&nbsp; And man, is he a cutie.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  On another note, the spider is still MIA and I'm a bit skeeved out.    &nbsp;  Have you ever had a dream that you can't quite remember but from which you wake up in a really weird mood?&nbsp; This has happened to me the past 2 nights, and I'm not liking it too much.&nbsp; Usually I have a reason for being depressed, or down or whatever.&nbsp; Not that I'm genuinely depressed, just in a weird mood.&nbsp; Hmm.

       &nbsp;There is a spider--a big, black, fast crawling spider--somewhere in my room.&nbsp; I hate spiders.&nbsp; I used to be petrified of them, but alas I learned to squish them when I lived on my own.&nbsp; Small ones don't even bother me anymore but big ones...that's another story.&nbsp;&nbsp;I braved it and&nbsp;stood on my desk to try to squish it with my shoe, but the damn thing fell down, ALIVE, and has been MIA ever since.&nbsp; I keep looking under my&nbsp;desk for it, and I'm sitting&nbsp;Indian-style on my desk chair for fear it will crawl up my leg.&nbsp; Two years ago, when I was living in Ashford, I used to get these HUGE spiders in my room from the garden outside my window.&nbsp; It was a raised ranch style house, and I was downstairs, so my window was level with the ground.&nbsp; And our landlady didn't take care of the landscaping (to the point of embarassment, but that's another story) so things were weedy and overgrown and gross.&nbsp; And huge ass spiders would crawl in my window.&nbsp; Armed with a can of spider spray, I would zap the motherfuckers before they got&nbsp;me, but one time one crawled under my bed and blended in with the hardwood floors.&nbsp; I slept upstairs that night.&nbsp; It was in the same house that a spider crawled in my left ear as a slept at about 5:30 AM.&nbsp; In my half-sleeping state, I ended up squishing it into my ear, and I mean way far inside.&nbsp; Legs were falling out for a week or two and then bits of the body would come loose.&nbsp; And just this afternoon, while I was at Walmart trying to get a watch battery, I felt a tickle on my arm and looked down only to see a small spider crawling on me.&nbsp; Yuck.&nbsp; So you see why I have a major spider aversion.&nbsp; I just hope this critter doesn't attack me in the middle of the night or something.&nbsp; But I'm going to get going because my knees are getting stiff from sitting Indian-style on a desk chair.&nbsp; Bah.

       ...I get into this whole blog thing.&nbsp; Not frequently, mind you.&nbsp; I'm actually a very private person who prefers my innermost thoughts to be kept just that way--private.&nbsp; I even hesitate to write down everything in my paper journal, in which I also write quite sporadically.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I'm "afraid" of.&nbsp; It's not like anyone I know who I really care about is likely to find this thing.&nbsp; I'm also not quite sure what I'm hoping to get out of this whole blog thing.&nbsp; Part of it is that I just like to play around with HTML code and the such, at which I am no genius, but I like tweaking thing around all the same.&nbsp; (Speaking of which, I really have to do something with this generic template...in my spare time.&nbsp; Ha.)&nbsp; Maybe I'll get more daring with my posts as time goes on.&nbsp; It's funny, I'm a nosy person by nature, but I'm not&nbsp;a gossip.&nbsp; I like to read other people's blogs but posting on mine is another story.&nbsp; The other thing is, I don't feel like I say anything significant.&nbsp; Of course, most of the other blogs I read on a semi-regular basis don't either.&nbsp; It's mostly just regular writing about their day to day existence, and I guess part of me envies that some people are able to just put themselves OUT THERE like that, to sacrifice their privacy to quench the virtual thirst of innately nosy internet addicts they may or may not even know exist.&nbsp; I guess&nbsp;a big part of me maybe is just scared of writing&nbsp;anything&nbsp;that might come back to bite me in the ass.&nbsp; On the other hand, I feel almost guilty for writing what seems like all about me, even though blogging is essentially a hobby of self-absorption, albeit a publicized one.&nbsp; I hate feeling self-centered or self-absorbed, given that I dislike that quality in others.&nbsp; And I'm also not sure who would want to read about my day to day life, and what I have to say about things; I lead a less than extraordinary existence, and&nbsp;I've never considered myself to&nbsp;be a particularly deep thinker...  &nbsp;   But c'est la vie.&nbsp; Obviously millions of other bloggers have gotten over it;&nbsp;I'm sure I will too.&nbsp; I could have fun with this whole blog thing.&nbsp; *wink*

       I broke down and put my air conditioner in.  I made it to August 1st without AC, but these past couple days have just been unbearable, especially with the humidity.  The only problem is, my room is in the basement, so with the AC in, I get like, NO sunlight, which I know is going to bother me, but I guess you've gotta consider the lesser of two evils.  Right now no humidity wins over no sunglight.      Oh, guess what?  Harry found the spider and vacuumed that sucker up.  I was sitting outside the other day talking with Mom & Harry, and I mentioned how I was scared to plug my computer back in because the plug is under my desk and the very thought of a big black spider being under there skeeved me out.  So Harry pipes up and says something like, "Oh that thing?  Man, that thing ugly!  I vacuumed him up and let the vacuum run for a few minutes."  He found it near where Keisha sleeps, near the window in the laundry room.  Thank GOD.  What a huge relief THAT was.        So I may have a date soon.  Not sure if it's really a date, but a first meeting.  Hmmm.  I'm intrigued.  More details as they unfold.  But basically I'm being set up with one of the coworkers of one of the mothers at work.        Speaking of work, I hardly even feel like I've had a weekend.  I stayed until 7PM on Friday to work on my room (which is looking pretty nice) and then I went shopping at Hammett's for school stuff and I have lesson plans and other paperwork to do at home tonight.  Doing it on my own time doesn't bother me too too much, although seeing as I have to be in at 5:45AM tomorrow, well, I'm like, living breathing and sleeping work this weekend.  At least I'll be sleeping work with cooler air tonight though.
