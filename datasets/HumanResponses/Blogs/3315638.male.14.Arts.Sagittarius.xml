       Goodness... It's been a pretty damned long time since i made a post... I guess i was pretty much coped up with stress from school and other stuff... So so tired... Damn... I screwed up my tests... Gosh... I'm so dead... I failed my math and i haven't told my parents yet... What's worse is that my dad got me a brand new stereo for my room! Argh... How am i going to tell him i failed my math? I mean... He took leave for a week or something just to tutor me before the tests... Damn... So frustrated... Why can't I just get a pass and be over with it? This is so unfair... I mean... I studied didn't i? Why me? Argh... Damn... I'll write another when i have settled all my problems...

       Goodness!! The most embarassing thing happened to me on my way to church! I think i touched some black paint while i was at the bus stop and i rubbed my left eye! No wonder everyone was looking at me in the bus! No one told me until i reached church and gabriel was like "my god... you got slapped or punched or bitten by your girlfriend or something?(i don't have one, he's just trying to psycho me or something)"... Argh... No wonder the school girls at the bus stop gave me a wierd look and started laughing! Argh! Damn damn damn...

       I had chemistry today... It wasn't so bad... Except when i left out my favourite question and did another question which i had a hard time figuring out the differences between mixtures and compounds... It sounds kind of silly now i know... I mean... Gosh... It sounds pretty much simpler now then in the test... Sigh... It was really a blow out... Anyway... Just for the fun of it i tried the phone booth again... Wasn't as funny as yesterday though... After tommorrow's physics test i'd be free from school til monday comes... Damn... (don't you just hate mondays?) I got to go pack my stuff now... I'm camping at my cousin's place again... Maybe i'd be going to church to check out who's there at night again... Lotsa people were there last night... I'll write another later on...

       This is the first time i'm publishing a blog i guess... I'm still unsure of how i view my blogspot... I keep clicking "view blog" but then a blank page with "url not found" or something turns up... I think i'll have to publish something first before i'm able to actually see the blog... Well... Today was quite alright... Apart from the incident where my history teacher told our class that our answers for the paper were rubbish and the math teacher told us that only 2 out of 35 people in our class passed our A math test i guess nothing else could be worse... I think... Well... I'm at home right now... My brother's yelling at me over the Pc... I promised i'd let him use it you see... But then i didn't say when... Argh... So tired now... Oh yeah... After our paper today, me and some of my classmates took to a phone booth at our school... Calvin punched in the security code for the "operater's pass" and got through... After that we were free to call without having to pay or have our calls traced! Haha... It was great fun! Tran called a chat line, "Yes... I'm above 18... Yeah... I'm a guy... Press 1 for male?"... He started laughing like crazy then he slammed down the phone... After pranking a few calls more Ivan wanted to order 40 pizzas and send it to the general office... Haha... Then someone suggested 5 otherwise "they'd think it's a prank"... Nevermind though said another we'll say it's for a celebration in the hall... Haha... Anyway... I didn't what happened after cause i took to the bus stop sharing an umbrella with bryan(he got the umbrella from his previous science teacher i think)... But it wasn't raining anymore so it was kind of wasted... Yawn... So tired now... I think i'd better pack up and leave for my cousin's place first... I'm tired of Marcus shouting in my ear...
