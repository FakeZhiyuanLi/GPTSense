         Everyone knows a George Costanza, you remember Jerry's friend on Seinfield.  The creepy, fat, bald guy with selfish beady eyes.  Sometimes its a friend, a neighbor, a stranger or a relative.  Sometimes there is more than one in your life.  Unfortunately, there is one, like a bad rash, that keeps making guest appearances in my life.  The first half of the Berlin Wall--what I affectionately like to call our privacy fence--went up Thursday night and it hadn't been 24 hours into our project and there was an incident.  The builder forgot a shovel in the yard next door.  My hubby happened to be looking out the back window, assessing the progress, at that precise moment.  He saw this particular Costanza and suddenly, the innocent little shovel was flung into our yard savagely. (Had someone been out there, someone might have been injured, it would not have been pretty.)    A primitive act of aggression, like that of a wild animal in the jungle.  What's next? Pissing around the parameter of his home?    The best way to deal with these shady hot-head characters is to eliminate them from your life.  Don't give them more than two seconds worth of time, sighing and shaking your head is okay.  Do not lose sleep by plotting against these weak and cowardly characters.  The world needs your energy output to be more creative and positive.  They build their own holes and crawl into them readily.    We witnessed another one on the road recently as well.  Two lane road, he started a third lane by inching on the side of us until he successfully cut us off.  He didn't get far, there was a semi in front of us and traffic was slow.  We didn't get upset instead we quietly observed him for a bit.  He picked his nose like he was digging for gold and we noted that his car was full of dents and scratches and it became obvious that he likes to pull that weird shit in traffic all the time.  Cojones only a Constanza type would have, its unfortunate that we have to share the road with them.    Is there a Costanza in your life?  Have you briefly crossed paths with one somewhere?  How have you coped?

      Fiesta del Sol is taking place this weekend.  Four years ago this month, particularly this weekend I met my hubby.  We both ended up on planning committees for Fiesta del Sol (FDS) in Pilsen.  Aside from meeting my hubby another positive thing occurred during my two years at FDS.  My interest in photography was awakened from a long hibernation.  I have not pursued it in the formal way that I would really like but believe me a photography class or workshop is in my future plans.    Below are some of my favorite pics amongst all the ones I took at FDS.      FDS started out as a fundraising block party in the winding streets of Pilsen.  When I was a kid my mother didn't like going, it was considered too dangerous because of the gangs and drunks.  Then it was moved to Cermak road, liquor was eliminated and an army of cops were placed on security detail.    Yes, that many people if not more show up every year.      And sometimes the dog comes along too.    There's a lot of yummy food and special treats.    There is always entertainment.  This is Casimiro from Banda El Mexicano.  He took most of the girls on staff out to dance while he was on stage.  Here he is coming straight for me.  I took the picture and made a run for it.      Kids from the local schools came out and did traditional Mexican folkcloric dances.  I thought this little girl was so cute.  It took me a while to get this picture because she was super shy and kept looking away.    And sometimes the event and stage area is used as an avenue to send out social messages.        Ana Esparza was fundraising money to pay for a liver transplant.  As an undocumented and uninsured child resources to her healthcare were in short supply.  I had followed her story in Exito and couldn't believe when I met her--she was very brave and mature.  I also couldn't believe I was standing near her booth when they got the call they had been waiting for, a liver donor had become available.  I still get chills thinking about that.  I was responsible for getting them from their booth to the festival's director, a few blocks away at the other end of the festival, where a car was waiting to take her to the airport.  I remember her mother looked so relieved but Ana looked so terrified and overwhelmed.  It was great the way everything worked out for her.      There's a wellness clinic for kids provided at FDS as well.  I have to confess that the doctor helped me by posing for this picture.  But I loved the result.    Finally, my last pic.  This kid shows off his medal, again with some of my encouragement.  He had just won in the soccer tournament for kids that is part of the festival.

      My week off is almost over.  Usually this is the point in the week when I feel relief, this week its dread.  Well I got to work on stuff I usually do not have time for.  I got some writing done, I got my blog going, I've been painting the bedroom, I tried a new recipe and most importantly I got to spend quality time at home.  Always running around, for me its a luxury to get to sit back drink a cup of chai and enjoy Smokey rolling around in catnip on the kitchen floor.  Then what makes it funnier than him squirming in a daze is thinking how my mother thinks giving the cats catnip is wrong, "Its not marijuana is it?"  She'll ask skeptically inspecting the catnip bag I bought at Petsmart.  Being home I also got to witness the lurking pigeons that my hubby has been telling me about.  They are trying to take up residence next to the air conditioner in the home office.  So we are trying to figure out a way to discourage them.  I'm not sure how they ended up here of all places.  This is a residential block, I thought they only hung out on busy streets.  But I saw the silhouette of it behind the air conditioner's side panels and I heard it too.  And when we tapped on the panels I saw it fly up to the roof next door.  A big white menacing pigeon.  Suddenly I understood why Birds the movie was a horror flick and why my former roommate was terrified of them, she called them rats with wings.    We also thought this was a good week to finally get the privacy fence built.  Its  going slow.  My husband's phone died and the builder lost his phone at Home Depot yesterday so communication has been affected.  They put in the posts yesterday.  We suspect the nosy neighbor, is not taking this well.  He pulled the peachtree he planted right next to the old chainlink fence over to his side with rope, I guess in fear that we would butcher it by cutting the branches that slap us in the face when we head over to the garage every morning.  It took a fence to get the message across because the polite hint last summer didn't.  He's a good neighbor doesn't cause any problems but its a little disconcerting to wake up one morning, look outside, find him chilling in your backyard, sitting in a chair painting the chainlink fence.  I would never go into his backyard without asking because I live by Benito Juarez's quote, "La Paz es el respeto al derecho ajeno."

      This calls for a celebration.  I had been trying to figure out how to add a list of my favorite links to my sidebar.  So tonight I was feeling a little brave.  I went into the guts of my blog and moved stuff around.  I managed to get a list of links up--although the spacing is off--but I did it. :)

      I had an interesting conversation tonight.  I will not go into detail about it but  it stirred a memory that lingers in the back of my head and I think about from time to time.    When I was in 8th grade in a Chicago Public School, I had a great teacher.  My class was the first to have algebra on its curriculum as a result of her efforts.  She created play-money and we were able to earn it in a variety of ways--for example getting an A was one or getting on the honor roll.  We were able to purchase stuff with this play-money as well--like paying to be seated next to your friend in class or paying fines for passing notes or not turning in your homework.  Then my 8th grade teacher did something that sounded great in the beginning but when I reflect on this, years later, something about it continues to bother me.  Arrangements were made and we all got pen-pals.  Sounds innocent enough, except that our pen-pals were students from an affluent Winnetka school.  It was a project that was part of their Spanish class, to help them practice their Spanish.  I must point out two things.  First, I'm still not sure how writing and exchanging letters with them was suppose to benefit us--the inner city public school students who were lucky to have an opportunity to learn algebra in 8th grade and which was probably standard with our pen-pals.  Second, how was it that they were suppose to practice Spanish with us?  Despite it being the native language to most of us, and with the exception of the esl students, most of us had not had a lesson in Spanish since being phased out of bilingual education in 2nd grade.  Two meetings were arranged.  One in our school and one at the Winnetka school.  When they arrived to our school--everything we had ever known--they said things like.  "This looks like a haunted house."  "Its so dark in here."  "This place looks scary."    This is also when I met my pen-pal.  She was nice but we shared nothing in common and we didn't have much to say to one another.  Our conversations and letters were brief and awkward.  All I remember is that her name was Radka and that meant Rose in another language.     Then our trip to their school was planned.  I'm not sure how but I ended up on the piñata making committee because someone thought it was a good idea that we arrive with gifts.  All I know is that I was third-party after cupid struck his arrow and two fellow classmates developed a pre-teen crush on each other.  It was so obvious and my only regret is not having the state of mind to do something a little evil--because I can be that way sometimes.  I should have called them out on it and totally embarrassed them because I'm not sure that anything ever materialized between them.  But I've digressed.  So we arrived with a cheesy home-made piñata that they refused to break and insisted on keeping.  (There was candy in there! Damn them.)  Their school had two gyms, lockers (Lockers? We had to wait for high school for that), big windows that looked out into some sort of courtyard, a big cafeteria, and the library was about the size of my neighborhood library.    Talk about coming home and feeling inadequate but not knowing how to put my finger on it.  Suddenly, I came back to my own school and realized how poor I was.  I knew I was not rich but I had never felt poor.  A piece of my innocence lost because up to this point I didn't think I was poor.  (Not even after spending Saturday mornings cleaning someone else's home with my mother for a while.)  Poor people were hungry and homeless.  I always had food to eat and I had a home and even my own room.    I want to believe that my 8th grade teacher must have had a goal in mind when she agreed to this.  I'm just not sure what it was or if there was one.  Perhaps she just thought it was a good idea and it would be something fun for her students to do.  Like that saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, I think this is a fine example of that saying.

      On some nights when I'm at the computer or watching t.v. I hear a shakey little meow and I see this little face    .   and I know that this specific meow means, "let's go mimis already."  And on some mornings this is the first thing I see.   .   And I know this means wake up I'm hungry.  I wouldn't trade these two for the world.

      I'm enjoying creating and keeping this blog.  I'm glad Diana and Analisa have catapulted me in this direction.  Its the journal I have not kept in years but now its virtual.  I get to write more and now when Diana asks if I've been writing I can just refer her here.    However, I'm not new to the world of blogs.  About a year ago, I was on the Chicago Bungalow website ( urlLink www.chicagobungalow.org )and was reading through its thread on the forum they have.  (I was hunting down info on skeleton keys for mortise locks.  I have a fascination with home repair and decor.  I indulge whenever I can.)  Well, there was an entry that caught my attention and referred readers to a website for details.    The website,  urlLink www.houseinprogress.net , was a blog and it was about a couple that had just bought a Chicago Bungalow.  The previous owner had gotten up and left everything--generations worth of stuff-- behind.  This couple bought the house with plans to restore it.  So since last summer I've been tuning into their blog on a regular basis to see what weird stuff they are sorting through or what project they are working on. I've become a voyeur of sorts, its also like reality t.v.    So a couple of months ago, I go to a reading where Anne Lamott is speaking.  I get my book autographed by her and then I see them--and I cannot believe I recognize them.  The House in Progress blogging couple.  I'm more star struck by them than I was by the witty Anne Lamott.  Before I can completely register my thoughts I blurt out to the husband, "I know you, I go to your website all the time."  I know I'm such a geek.  They were real sports about it.  Apparently it was not the first time this had happened to them.    Well, to close I'll share a little tid-bit about the coolest thing that I think has happened to this couple so far as they scavenge through all the junk in their home.  Like I said they bought a house and the previous owner left everything behind.  Instead of throwing it out they decided to sort through it.  Their coolest find--according to me--was an  urlLink original sculpture by Enrique Alferez , Mexican artist that was in Pancho Villa's army!  Of course I had never heard about him until I read about him on their blog but I thought what I read about him afterward was completely fascinating.  Doesn't that make you want to go dig through your basement and garage and see what you find?

      Why am I addressing this today?  I'm not pregnant and have no children but it's something that I've given thought to in the past.  Also, last Saturday my cousin gave birth to her daughter via a c-section and then John Stossel's(20/20) email this week is about c-sections.   I've always wondered if c-sections are a form of population control--after the third one you get your tubes tied automatically, almost like a bonus prize.  Makes me feel like some sick bigwigs out there with a lot of power may be rationalizing that its less obvious and more humane than making certain segments of the population sterile. I can't remember the last time I heard of someone I know having a vaginal birth.  My cousin and a friend related that their blood pressure was high so they had to be given something (Magnesium?) to keep them from getting a seizure but this drug also keeps you from dilating which means more than likely you are going to end up going in for an emergency c-section...hmmm.  John Stossel says that, "C-sections are more expensive**, more painful, require longer hospital stays, and are more likely to kill a woman than a vaginal birth."    So you would think that the thing to do is to plan to lead the healthiest pregnancy ever.  Lay off the salt and get plenty of exercise.  What if your doctor is in a rush?  I have another friend that led an exceptionally healthy pregnancy with plenty of walking for exercise.  She said that she knew her doctor didn't wait long enough for her baby to turn and position himself for birth when she started giving orders for her to push.  She said she felt her son hitting the wall above the birth canal. Ouch! Her doctor impatiently ordered a c-section as well.  Here is more on what John Stossel has to say about c-sections:  "...personal injury lawyers made millions [suing doctors who delivered babies who developed cerebral palsy] and it's one reason doctors started doing more C-sections. In fact, over the past 30 years, C-sections in America rose from 6 percent of all births to 26 percent of births today."   "The increase in this major surgery might have been worthwhile had it at least reduced the amount of cerebral palsy, but it didn't! The incidence of cerebral palsy has stayed the same! Scientists recently concluded cerebral palsy is rarely caused by birth trauma."   Its also about the money.  And I guess its easier for John Stossel to make that point than it is for me to prove its a conspiracy to keep the population of people of color in control.    **Footnote:You know what else I think is about the money when it comes to the whole baby thing.  Formula.  My mother's generation was discouraged from breastfeeding although, now the trend has made a big comeback.  Formula was suppose to be healthier.  However, the first milk a mother produces for her baby has essential antibodies that baby can't get elsewhere and baby is less likely to suffer from ear infections when breastfed.  I think someone also said cigarettes and coca-cola were healthy when they first emerged.

      I recieved a set of three pretty ceramic&nbsp;bowls as a gift last Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very rustic and pretty--I liked the deep muted tones on it so much that I was going to base my kitchen decor around them.&nbsp; Like I said I like them but the dilemma is whether I should continue to keep them?&nbsp; You see, when I arrived home and removed them from the box and placed them on a shelf where I could see and appreciate them I noticed a warning on the box.&nbsp; Apparently it was against the law to sell these bowls in California and I believe there was a biohazard icon on the package--but perhaps that is my paranoia embellishing my memory of it.&nbsp; The warning on the box encouraged the user to keep the bowls as decorations rather than eat from them, however if you flip the bowls over it states that it is dishwasher and microwave safe.&nbsp; I have never&nbsp;used them and&nbsp; I feel horrible tossing them out since they were a gift from a very dear relative.&nbsp;They are practically brand new and so pretty.&nbsp; I tried to google 'radioactive bowls' and 'radiation dishes'&nbsp;but had no luck.&nbsp; However, I did learn&nbsp; that the glaze on old dishes&nbsp;(before the 70's)&nbsp;had radiation and sometimes uranium was added to dishes in certain colors.&nbsp; So tonight&nbsp;the dishes have become a quiet mance that beckon me from the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll build the courage to toss them soon.&nbsp; I would like to dispose of them responsibly but if finding information about them was hard I would imagine that information on their disposible is probably impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are 'contaminated' are they causing harm just by sitting there?&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'm still getting the feel of this place and getting settled in.&nbsp; I'm really happy with my pink skin.&nbsp; Pink used to be a favorite color of mine when I was a little girl and then I abandoned it for Red but recently its made a comeback.&nbsp; I've been&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;fond of&nbsp;fushia.&nbsp; I would love to paint at least a wall in this color at home but I don't think that would sit well with my hubby.&nbsp; I'll settle for flowers or a small item in this color.&nbsp;   I had trouble finding 'settings' to&nbsp;plug in the description of my blog but I finally got that done.&nbsp; But not after sending an email to blog support--just as soon as I hit that send button I went to write today's post and wallah I found the tab for settings that I had been searching for in the dashboard area.&nbsp; My apologies to blog support and I hope I did not waste too much of their time.&nbsp;   Its hot out today and I don't like it.&nbsp; I felt like a cookie baking in an oven when I stepped outside to go to work.&nbsp; The&nbsp;sun&nbsp;beamed down on me like it had&nbsp;it out for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and the heat&nbsp;are not a good combination it makes me bitchy and irritable.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Apologies for my husband if I was short with you this morning.)&nbsp; I feel decieved as well the weather channel said it was going to be a cool week.&nbsp; And I know you shouldn't ever believe them but I did&nbsp;because it has been a fairly cool summer.&nbsp; For now I'll seek out the shade and hide in air conditioned places--fantasize about crisp autumn days.  &nbsp;

       "It's like liquid heaven," Doug on t.v. sitcom King of Queens.   The water is back, by the time I got home the city workers were done.  All of two or three hours is what it took.  And we were right the leak was out on the street.  Now our water pressure is obscene.  Never before seen like this in this home--its like Niagra Falls.    I guess the water dance worked after all. :D

      Oprah's been called to jury duty and has been reporting to Cook County Courthouse at 26th and California.    I'm including the following highlights from a Chicago Tribune story that ran today:   Holding a copy of "Anna Karenina" while searching for a breadless turkey sandwich in one of the busiest criminal courthouses in the nation, TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey seemed confident she would not be picked to be a juror Monday.  But after 4 1/2 hours of jury selection--including her initial statement to the judge that she was not sure she could be impartial toward a defendant who would not testify--Winfrey was sworn in as one of 12 jurors in the murder trial of Dion Coleman, 27.  The trial is expected to last three days, for which the billionaire media mogul will be paid $17.20 per day, just as the other jury members are.  The 75-year-old courthouse, known simply as "26th and Cal," is among the city's grittiest locales, with crowds of defendants, their families and friends hanging out in the halls of the building waiting for hundreds of cases to be called.  Cops wait around to testify, and defense attorneys sometimes negotiate with their clients for cash payment on the spot.     Did anyone tell her she can get  urlLink naked chicken  at Popeyes across the corner from the courthouse?  And well since I'm a Chicago History nut.  I have to throw this in here.  The prison was formerly known at Bridewell Prison.  And a lot of cool and old pictures of it can be found  urlLink here .          I remember waiting for the bus at this corner my freshman year.  Sometimes when traffic got bad, and it often did, my friends and I got a head start and began walking because the 26th street bus eventually caught up to us.  The inmates would see us walking outside and begin screaming stuff like, "Hey, girl what's your name?" or "Can I have your number?"  We would usually giggle and walk faster.

      For the last couple of weeks we gradually started losing our water pressure.  At first I wondered if it was due to open fire hydrants, after all its summer but its not a very hot one so that was highly unlikely.  And then this Sunday we totally ran out of water in our second floor unit, the first floor has very little pressure and the basement is gradually fading.  So what did we do? We improvised a water dance, bought a case of bottled water and went to take showers at the in-laws. (Who by the way, have obscene water pressure, forget fancy showerheads at that house.) We also called the city's water department, we are 99.9% positive that this is an outside problem.  The last time we had this problem the inside plumbing was given an update and it solved the problem temporarily but we now suspect it wasn't the root of the problem.    An email to our alderman and a call to 311 later the emergency Sunday crew for the water department showed up.  One of them came into our basement and put his hearing thingy-device up against the wall to the front of the house where the water main comes from the street.  Yeah, he heard the same leak we had been hearing.  Weird how we could hear this by a brick wall, I know, its hard to explain you would need to be there.  And when he went outside and inspected the ground near our water main cap his body language and response let us know this was serious.  They took note that our home did not have a water meter, and will probably be installing one--shoot.  They said they would put a rush on it and would be back to fix it within five days because their department was a little backed up. What?  So I've evoked a vegetative state the last two days in order to keep my sanity.  I've made an effort not to talk much to keep from saying negative stuff.  This is the first time I share it with anyone, not wanting to magnify the problem by speaking about it.  I'm keeping an open mind and wondering what is the lesson in this.  Besides the fact that old pipes corrode and leaks occur--grrr.    Well today my mother tapped into her resources.  If this goes through I will begin to believe that city workers aren't that bad after all.  I'll be more sympathetic next time I see one shoveling and the other two watching--they're there for moral support you know ;).  Lesson learned: Its not what you know, its who you know. (Well I knew this but this event just reconfirms it.)  Long story short, someone's supervisor was called, who in turn called back and said they would have a crew on this by this afternoon.  Really? No five day wait?  I gotta see this to believe it.

      I've done it once or twice before, while waiting in line at the grocery store I inadvertently begin to notice what someone nearby has in their grocery cart.  I never comment on it loudly or at all.  I may quietly point out to my husband that we forgot to pick up butter because I see it in another cart.  I'm sometimes guilty of having judgmental thoughts when I spot carts full of stuff like cheese puffs and kool-aide, "Well, no wonder her kids are all fat." I'll wonder if she knows its all the hydrogenated fat and sugar she's feeding them.  I sometimes even imagine what their home life is like.  What else is there to do when the lines are long and moving slow?  Yesterday I came across a very bold woman in the line in front of us at Sam's Club.  I could forgive a glance.  Even a comment like, "We forgot to pick up butter," or even a question,"Where did you find that?"  We also forgive, or better yet have come to expect, the stares when we go cereal happy at Aldi's.  (You can't beat a box of cereal at a buck fifty a piece--a third less of the price at regular super markets.  So we pick up about six to ten boxes of our favorite cereals ranging from the generic versions of shredded wheat to fruity pebbles.)    So after making my careful selections at Sam's Club and once I'm convinced I did not forget anything I get in line.  I patiently wait for my turn and when I get close enough I begin to load my items on the conveyor belt.  There is no cereal freak show here, all essentials really.  Milk, eggs, chicken, pasta and well we did splurge on some feta cheese--big deal.    After carefully placing my items on the conveyor belt just right, since Sam's Club doesn't pack items in bags they just throw them in your cart haphazardly.  I leave the bread for the end and place the heavier items up first.      This woman looks at my groceries and tells her daughter, "They're eating better than we are."  They laugh and repeat this line to each other a few times.  I look at my items and then at hers, suddenly self-conscious.  She has two cases of canned tangerines, a bucket of mini-cinnamon buns and a pack of beef jerky. I become defensive and the generalizations that my parents made, as I was growing up, about other cultural groups and their eating habits begin to creep up.  Then I realize it has to be more than that.  I could never be so verbally bold so I wonder if they think that my husband and I perhaps do not understand English.  Perhaps that is why she feels alright making this comment so loudly, "They're eating better than we are." Why shouldn't I?  We work, our money is just as green as theirs, too bad their grocery selection sucks.    We try to decipher their comment on our way home.  So we had picked up some feta and tri-colored pasta--big deal.  After a moment of blasting the woman and her daughter and their sucky grocery selection we fall silent.  I begin thinking of their homelife.  Of that bucket of mini-cinnamon buns sitting on their kitchen counter because there wasn't enough space in the dark brown 70's kitchen cabinets --their appliances are all avocado green.  The daughter will probably pick through them absentmindedly while she has a conversation on the phone--perhaps even let the dog eat one.   As for us, we had a great Sunday dinner: breaded cat fish and pasta salad.

      I realize that my posts have been leaning towards the negative and depressing.  And I'm an optimist at heart, so I decided to compile a list of things that make me smile and warm my heart.  1. The hopeful homeless guy--He hangs out in the Archer and 35th street area and I've seen him during some of my commutes to work.  The first time I noticed him he was sitting on a bench with a cart of his possessions next to him.  He surprised me when he got up and picked up a piece of litter and placed it in the garbage can near him.  I saw him again yesterday and he had a k-9 companion, the cutest dog ever, he was sitting on the floor, learning against the building and combing his dog lovingly.  2. People on mopets--I've been seeing a lot of them this week.  I saw two more people yesterday.  I secretly want one now.  3. Chai--A hot cup or a cold glass.  4.  urlLink Real Simple --the latest issue of my favorite magazine arrived in the mail this week.  5.  The little old lady with the two chocolate labs that lives on 31st.   6.  Pita, the black mutt-lab mix that lives down the block.  7. Amelie, the movie, I could watch it over and over.   8. Really friendly staff at IHOP last night.  9. Finishing a poem, short story, etc. (anything written)   10.  urlLink Netflix  nights (Formerly known as Blockbuster nights. You can keep up with Netflix related stuff at this   urlLink blog .) My account queue and their seemingly unending selection of foreign films.  Been a happy customers for about six months now.  11. Last but not least my monthly meetings with my Latina writers group.      I think this is a good start.  I'll add more later.

         How important is remembering history?  Remembering dates and events of a country's history, a culture's background, or how the world might have begun is critical. But I also think there is a great value in knowing where you personally came from--one's own personal history.  Mexicanos and immigrants in the U.S. sometimes lose a lot of this, leaving behind so much more than their land.  You can only transport so much of your culture, its not easy to pass down an old china or silverware set, recipes might lose some autheticity if all the ingridients are not readily available, pictures are some of the few materials things that might be easily transported.  My mother still has this one lone silver serving spoon that used to belong to one of her great-aunts and it makes her smile and recall her aunt fondly almost every time she uses it.    Sometimes I feel that gaining knowledge of my family history takes investigation.  I guess that when my parents and family arrived the mission was to find work, have money and build a higher quality of life.  Sometimes a random family story was shared but for the most part I felt like it was something taken for granted.  I had to make a conscious decision to ask questions after my grandfather passed away a few years ago.  Tell me, tell me, tell me, I implored.  My paternal grandmother helped me fill the blanks in a family tree and I was able to collect names back a few more generations than I had expected to--at least for my father's side of the family.  Above is a picture taken in Mexico of my mother when she was a little girl, she was about 2 1/2 years old.  She's with her two aunts and a couple of cousins. They had taken a day trip into Monterrey, the city.    I placed it in a new frame recently and gave it a more prominent spot in the livingroom.  I'm not sure why I didn't do it sooner.  I guess it takes time sometimes to realize how much we value certain items.  This is one of the only pictures that I have of my great-aunts.  They were like a third and fourth grandmother to me.   My tia Cuca, second from the left, will continue to live on through more than this picture.  I inherited the priceless knowledge and love for crochet through her when she decided to teach me--I was seven and could not sit still.  I have a mother because my abuelita Maria, far right, cared for a premature baby that my maternal grandmother could not care for due to circumstance.       My husband and I have spoken about family history.  If we ever have children, the one thing we will definitely give them is their family history.  Leaving behind a material inheritance is one thing but giving them a sense of who they really are is priceless.

       Colin Powell the Cat to Meet Human Powell     By Associated Press Published August 13, 2004, 6:51 AM CDT  WASHINGTON -- Colin Powell, the cat, will meet on Friday with Colin Powell, the secretary of state.  Colin Powell, a black Bombay pedigreed cat, has been named cat of the year by the Cat Fanciers' Association.  Colin Powell, the secretary of state, has agreed to a meeting in the State Department's Treaty Room on the seventh floor -- for pictures, not dialogue.  The room has served lofty purposes through history, including the signing of important treaties.   (I got this article from chicagotribune.com)    First it was dressing up as a construction worker and dancing the YMCA, now this.  I guess with a job like his, he needs all the comic relief he can get?  I wonder if he cancelled an important meeting with a human, perhaps a foreign vip for this kodak moment.    Would he be willing to pose for a picture with my non-pedigree cats?

      ...too much  urlLink lead in his Mexican candy .  That's what I'm guessing it must have been.  And mom probably didn't top his food with a healthy dose of  cilantro.  (I understand that its a good antidote for lead.)  Why else would I walk out every morning for the past few months and see something more offensive than this abandoned home?     Let's zoom in so you could see what I'm talking about.     The graffiti bothers me but its the swastikas that I find really disturbing.  This kid obviously missed a few history classes, I don't think his brown punk ass would have fit the aryan appearance requirement for the nazis.  But what is most annoying is that I've placed a few phone calls to the city's service line and specified that there is hate crime graffiti on this house.  Its been a few months and still nothing.  I get caught up with life and forget to keep calling them--how many times should I have to call them?  Hmmm, but the same city sent me a notice today letting me know that they are going to plant a tree on my front lawn that I never requested but they say that I did.  I want to help save the world, plant a tree and help the ozone layer but I think educating our kids--teaching them some history--is a bigger priority right now.

      Yesterday afternoon on my commute home I saw a women on a light aqua mopet and she was wearing a big red helmet.  But what I couldn't get over was her attire.  She was wearing a cute little black suit--a jacket and skirt--with a crisp white shirt and black heels that had to be at least three inches.  I wondered how she was going to do it when she had to stop and possibly balance herself by leaning on one foot.  Everyone was staring not just me.  She was like a freak show on Archer Avenue.  And she drove over the Ashland bridge and I held my breath for her safety.  I have to admit it looked like a lot of fun but the other drivers on the road didn't seem to have the patience to deal with her--their discrimination against her cute little mopet was very obvious. (Sigh) No riding around on a mopet with my husband, like Amelie and Nico, anytime soon.  I guess its for the best.  I'm guilty of crashing a mopet on Isla Mujeres when I went there for my Spring Break about ten years ago (yikes!).    Also, I got big news.  I've picked a date, its official and the countdown has begun.  In 21 days I will be giving my notice at work.  By then Mercury will be out of retrograde--I missed the open mic last night because of a breakdown in communication.      I will be a liberated woman by mid-December.  I've read a little more of the Celestine Prophesy.  Its going slow, like too slow but I guess its because I got to take it small chunks.  I'm trying to make time for it but I got caught up with other work yesterday afternoon.  Right now I want nothing more than a reading chair at home, everything is out of wack since we are still camping out in the livingroom.  The bedroom is almost done.  We haven't touched it since last weekend but I feel this will be the weekend we finally get a lot more done.  Perhaps we can get the people for the floor in by next week.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Talk about synchronicity.  Why is it that now that I am trying to finish this post--I admit, instead of working, does my boss hover around my cube trying to talk to my officemate.  If I click out of this page to fast she might notice and if I don't she just might notice that second paragraph.    Gotta get myself away from this page casually and despistadamente....

      There was a helicopter making the rounds this morning in our neighborhood.  It was loud and a sound that was definitely out of place.  It made me think of movies that portray helicopter chases in L.A. and I began to wonder if someone was on the run.  When I walked out the back door and looked up at the chopper I saw the Channel 7 logo.  "Why are they out here?"  'Cause you know they never seem to cover Little Village unless its murder or a parade.  It turned out to be this:  "Two construction workers are hospitalized after an accident Wednesday morning in the city's Little Village neighborhood. The laborers were working on a new school at 31st and Kostner. They were on top of a 10,000 lb. piece of concrete used to build the roof on when it gave way. It dropped about 15 feet with the laborers riding it down until it landed." ( urlLink abc7chicago.com )  Thankfully no one died.  We saw the ambulances barely pulling away from the construction site when we rode out of the garage and turned onto 31st.  How did the station get the scoop so fast?  I was impressed.  However, not everyone was lucky today.    "...Cecilio Montes, reported to be 9 months old, was pronounced dead this afternoon...Earlier today...Angelica Arreola, 8, had died. Both children were pulled from the water, along with their mother, and had been listed in critical condition at Children's Memorial.  Angelica was throwing rocks into the water at Monroe Harbor about 9:45 p.m. Monday when she slipped and fell in. The children's mother, Rosalia Jimenez, panicked and jumped in after the girl, somehow taking Cecilio in with her, police said." ( urlLink Chicagotribune.com )  I can't begin to imagine what this mother is going through.  Although, I know this mother didn't pull her baby in with her intentionally when I read this I kept thinking of La Llorona.  I feel a poem developing but I'm not sure about it yet.  And then there was the better than a telenovela news coverage of the Scott Peterson trial.  His lover took the stand yesterday and all the juicy details of their relationship are being revealed.  I know he is innocent until proven guilty but this man had to be guilty as charged everything is pointing towards him.  To get the best scoop and read the phone transcripts of their telephone conversations go to  urlLink Modbee.com .    And just when you thought that things couldn't get worse than Bush, along comes a man named Keyes.  A resident of Maryland and suddenly he wants to run for the State Senate race against Obama in Illinois.  Um, has anyone else noticed those puppet strings?    Keyes has accussed Obama of 'running away' because his requests for more debate dates were not honored.  Obama replied, "At this point, the schedule is getting short, and we are not going to have my schedule and the schedule of my campaign dictated by somebody who just arrived two days ago," Well said. (quote from chicagotribune.com)  Also, if you're planning on visiting the Field Museum again, you should do it soon.  As of October 1st they are hiking the entrance fee another $2.  The culprit, is the usual suspect, the economy has not rebounded since the 9/11 attacks, people aren't visiting us like they used to etc. etc.  Hmm, that's the same excuse I got for not getting my raise.  So how should I explain to the cats that there will be a cut in their kitty treats because of the 9/11 attacks.  I'm not being insensitive but the excuse is getting lame.   Well let's hope the weather continues this great.  Its Autumn in August what a beautiful thing.  And a few weeks back I thought we were about to enter the canicula because August is always the hottest month 'round here.

      When feeling disillusioned with my job--like today--I take lunch and blog.  I spent the morning going over a manual to set up a service through the United States Post Office.  The language is so dense.  Why can't instructions all be as easy to follow as my Caldo de Hardware recipe?  I'm not done with this and will probably spend the afternoon on this pesky task.  "Make sure to have a good day", that's what I told my husband when I left him this morning.  "You too," he said.  I'm trying, I'm trying, I seriously am.  And I'm not having a bad day either but I got a serious case of the blahs.   I've also been feeling guilty about an argument I had with my father a couple of days ago.  Guilty enough that I'm tempted to call him and apologize.  But I'm not sure I'm completely wrong with what I said so I am going to think about it some more.  Sometimes things need to be vented, its not healthy to keep it suppressed.  And when he asked why I was so angry at him and the family?  Well it was like setting off a bomb--a big bomb.  I didn't realize that my anger was that apparent, I have been acting civil towards everyone, even smiling and sharing a joke or a meal with them.  My husband suggests that its possible that I'm too righteous.  Well I answered my father's question and I don't think he was ready for my response. But perhaps it served as an informal therapy session.  Let's hope we can move on from here.     I also started reading the Celestine Prophecy last night.  After years of meaning to, a month of having purchased it and plenty of people saying that "You just have to read this book."  And I have to say that I tried years ago when I first heard about it, I asked a former roommate to borrow it after she ranted and raved about it.  She suddenly turned on me, clutched her copy to her chest, eyed me suspiciously and said, "No, you should really get your own copy."  Now, that my husband has read it and after that fight with my dad and change in career plans in the near future, he says, "I think your ready for it, you're meant to read that book now."  And I have to confess that is the feeling I got when I walked into the bookstore and came upon it.  I felt like it was meant for me to buy it right then and there.  I will follow up and blog my progress with the book later.  For now, if you wish, to answer the question in my title.  You can follow the white rabbit by going to  urlLink www.sacrificezone.blogspot.com .  A blog with a very cool feature.

      This is a Mexican film that is based on a story by Juan Rulfo.  According to the movie description on Netflix, the film is by Arturo Ripstein and pays homage to Luis Buñuel's work. This is the first Ripstein film I've ever seen and I'm not familiar with any of his other work.     The film is about Dionosio Pinzon, a poor man living in a small town with his mother. Dionisio becomes interested in cockfights but is too poor to buy a cock to fight or to gamble.  Dionisio also has a gimp arm that probably keeps him from having a regular job so he is the town "announcer" for a lack of a better word.  He walks around and stands on a little crate and in a loud voice projects news and ads.  At one point he is lucky that he is given an injured gamecock.  Dionisio begins fighting his cock and gambling.   I will not give the movie away by telling you more.  But its a movie that needs to be watched with an objective and open mind.  My hubby and I watched it a few months ago and we still reflect on it.  When he first saw it, my husband said it was like watching a nightmare.  I believe that is exactly what was meant to be conveyed.  Ripstein did everything for a reason, including the bad singing.  Bad singing that will resonate in your head after the movie is over.      Everything is a reflection of the hopeless situation that Dionisio finds himself in.  Also, viewers should remain cognizant that this story is not just a story that would take place in a rural town in Mexico or any other poor country.  The setting can easily be changed to a thriving urban city in the U.S.--Las Vegas maybe.  The lesson I took with me is that the cycle of poverty is a hard one to break.  That is why rags-to-riches and riches-back-to-rags stories are common, i.e. lottery winners and M.C. Hammer (hehe).  Again, I highly recommend this movie.  Its an older Mexican film from 1986 so you might not find it at Blockbuster.  We rented it from Netflix.  You will also probably recognize Blanca Guerra from the cheesy narco-traficante Mario Almada films of the 80's and 90's.

      We've been painting the bedroom all summer.  It would have been done in a day in most modern homes but we had this to address.     Very deep cracks in the plaster walls.    And I have to admit that we have taken this project at a fairly slow pace.  And by some law of the universe, any time you set out to do a home project and estimate how long it will take, you should automatically multiply that estimate by two.  It always takes longer.  In our house its more like five.  Also, I can't help but pay attention to certain details.  This drove me nuts.     The door hinge had a couple of layers of paint.  I had read about removing paint off of hardware by boiling it in water.  I found an  abandoned pot in the basement and put my hardware to boil.       (I really didn't want to use paint remover since I am of child bearing age and it has an extensive list on its warning label on the hazards of birth defects. I'm also weary of highly flammable liquids.)   After boiling for a few minutes I saw the paint begin to peel away.  I couldn't help but pull a piece out to take a closer look.     Then after scraping paint with a putty knife and a pick, I turned to my trusty steel wool.    Wallah:      The hinge on the left still needs a tad bit of paint removed from the side.  I'm so happy with the results that I'm already eyeing all the other painted hardware in the house.

      Smokey is my perfect feline companion.  He always finds a spot on the desk next to the computer and naps.  He gets to hear most of my writing in its roughest form.  He purrs, knocks out, and sometimes snores and drools.  Yes, I never knew cats drooled but perhaps its cause he's at that senior age now.  (My hubby and I have had an ongoing debate on whether cats fart or don't fart.  I've never heard them fart, he swears he has and a google search didn't turn up much.)  I had to do the open mic tonight.  It was a slow night but I really enjoyed one of the poems read that addressed some pretty universal questions, like if Mary Kate and Ashley are so rich why are they so thin, and when will jlo stop dating so many different guys--my favorite--why are people with stinky breath or body odor so unaware.  I felt pretty inspired and added a few more lines to a new poem I'm working on, hope to complete it by next wed.  I came home a little hungry and was really dissapointed to find that we were out of milk.  What's worse than being out of your favorite cereal is being out of milk when there is plenty of your favorite cereal in stock.  In times like this milk becomes such a commodity.

      Its a great way to indulge me.  Make me weak in the knees by waving some Chicago History at me. It was my favorite class in high school, I still have my notebook to prove it.    The Chicago Tribune special section last week  urlLink Unauthorized Loop  was exactly the kind of stuff I'm talking about.  After reading it in its entirety I learned a few more things that were not covered in class.  I'll share a few here.  For example, I was home sick watching television when news aired about two Loop disasters.  I was a sophomore in 1992 during the great downtown flood, I remember watching the news in my pajamas and suddenly learning that there were all these unknown tunnels and underground levels in downtown Chicago and they were full of water.  And last October I was nursing a broken foot when the afternoon news began reporting a fire in a downtown government office.  I never imagined that it would have been as bad as it actually got.    Also, this is the lesson I missed when I took off from school the day of the Annual Senior Ditch Day celebration:  "Presidents: Seven Loop streets are named for U.S. presidents: George Washington, James Madison, James Monroe, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren. ...[an] 1830 survey of the village of Chicago had Washington Street as the southern boundary and Jefferson Street (west of the Chicago River) as the western border, presumably because of the importance of the two men in U.S. history. By 1835, other streets had been given their presidential names, generally in chronological order.... anti-federalism feeling in the village [is blamed] for placing Adams Street in a more southern location and for honoring John Quincy Adams with only his middle name."  Then there's the story about that red Picasso structure.  In 1967, when the Picasso statue was unveiled in what is now the Daley Center Plaza, one very ignorant alderman suggested the steel sculpture be deported and replaced with a statue by a famous Chicagoan.  Also, guess what Picasso did with $100,000 check he received for the job? He tore it up and declared his statue a gift to the city of Chicago.  And one more bit of quick trivia before I sign off for the night.  This afternoon when I stopped to peruse the books in front of the vast Chicago books section at the Oak Park Borders I learned a little bit about a spot closer to home.  I came across a 1942 picture of children holding vegetables they had harvested.  The name of their project was Victory Garden and it was located on 32nd and Keeler.  From living just a block and a half away from this location I knew that their garden was replaced with what is today Piotrowski Park.  (Something else I learned today is that Piotrowski Park is the largest and only park in Little Village--that's pretty sad since its kind a small--only about two blocks wide and two blocks long--and its not well maintained at all.  The running path is usually flooded forcing runners and walkers, like-me to run through the grass.)  Well in the background of this picture we could see the top halves of the bungalows that still line that street. And from keeping up with another Tribune special on  urlLink Gang Warfare  in Little Village I also know this is the block where a boy was killed earlier this summer as he tried to run into the safety of his home--one of the same brick bungalows that faces the park--there's a cross of plastic flowers marking that family's  luto  right now.   Well the book had a hefty price tag, and I already had made some purchase selections so I left it behind--sniffle, sniffle.    I also got to thinking of the pictures that Betty, the previous owner of the home we now live in, showed me once.  She was 13 years old when her parents built this house and she showed me a black and white photograph of the house being built.  The bricks were barely being laid and the house was beginning to take shape.  There were other pictures too.  There was one where Betty and her sister stood on the front steps and I noticed that the original stair railings where made out of wood and you could see the house next door, where I grew up.  And when I looked at that second picture, I focused on the first floor livingroom windows behind the two smiling girls.  I was intrigued and wondered what had been behind those venetian shades that were closed shut when the picture was taken.  What life had taken place there before my family came along?  There was also another picture taken in the back yard and I noticed that back then there were no fences--the irony huh.  Too bad those pictures were lost when Betty got sick and her relatives finally had an excuse to take her to a nursing home and sell the house she had refused to leave all her life.           Geez, I hate to leave on such a depressing note but I cannot think of anything else to share and lift the mood.   Hey, I almost forgot about this link.  I came across it while skimming readers responses to the Tribune Loop special.   urlLink www.lunchintheloop.com . This is going to come in handy next time me and my officemates debate about where we should order lunch from.  I'm hoping to go back and scout out all the real Mexican food joints 'cause Chipotle isn't cutting it, its named after the most delicious of all hot peppers and they give you bland and cold burritos.  Taco Fresco, on Adams is not too bad but its a franchise and doesn't serve horchata or Jarritos.  The place on congress that does serve horchata makes their tacos with yellow cheese and I can't overlook that, make up your mind, is it Tex-mex or Mexican?      'night ya'll...
