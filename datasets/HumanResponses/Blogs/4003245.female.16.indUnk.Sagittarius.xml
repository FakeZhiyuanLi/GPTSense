      I went to the carnival today. For like an hour and a half. I rode on the kiddie rides...seeing as how I didn't have anyone to ride the "big kid" rides w/ me. But...it didn't matter anyway, I had a good time. I had a funnel cake. num num num and a piece of cardboard pizza. Let me tell you the rides I went on..mmmkay?...mmkay. I first went on the "Hip-Hop" lol. Yes...surprisingly enought that was a fun ride...lol its where you sit on the seat and it takes you up and starts to drop you, then catches you then sends you back up again, and again and again. Of course, everytime it dropped us my sister Carrie and the other kids on the ride would scream. Lol..It was so funny. AAAAHHHH........................AAAAHHHH................................AAAHHHH lol Yea kinda like that. lol it was funny. THEN I went on the Ferris Wheel. That ride is extremely long let me tell you. It was kinda funny cuz dad would freak out everytime my sisters would move, (this is b/c he is afraid of heights). Lol...It was funny though. Then I went on the Tilt-A-Whirl with Carrie. That was fun, I spun round and round and round lol. Then I went on the Banana. Which is just a rather large slide. My sister got to the top and then decided she didn't wanna go. The guy was really nice and said he would ride down with her and she was like..NO I want my daddy. So she went doesn the steps and I waited at the top of the slide with the friendly carnival working teenager. When my sister came up she said..I have to go down with you! hehehe. I was like...Okay then. SO we went down the slide with me clutching my sister really tight because I was afraid I'd drop her on the way down. = / Which would have really sucked. Then we went to go get the pizza that we were bringing home and two funnel cakes for the five of us to share. As we were leaving, I saw Kelley and Julie and some other chick. (Kelley and Julie had the nerve to go to an Evanescence concert w/ two extra tickets and not tell me.) I tell you...some people. I gave her a hug and talked w/ them for a whole, I'd say 30 seconds, and then I skooted on out of there with my parents. That's about all I have time for at the moment....so I'll check in later! Luv me always...and as I always..I love you James!

I say...Practice what ya preach. But...lol w/e. So it's 3:09 and I'm bored to tears. I was up in my room listening to Ashlee Simpson (Thanks to James) and my sisters found me and wanted their nails painted. So, I painted their nails and crimped their hair and put ugly little flowers on their big toes. That took about 2 hours. Yea...that was fun. Lol. So now I don't really know what to do and it kinda sucks but I get to talk to James at 10:00 and then I won't be bored...tired..but not bored..lol. Anyway, oh yea...and I watched Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen...again. It's a cute movie though. And now..I gotta go because my sister is trying to read this...Love you James!

      Well as you know, my mom and I don't exactly see eye to eye on many things. I hate living at home. I feel worthless and that everything I do is wrong. I'm going to pity myself because that is what I'm in the mood to do, so you'll get over it. Besides, no one's making you read this! Lol....&nbsp;Anyway back to my personal pity party. My mom gets mad at me for the simplest thing. I work two jobs and I work everyday of the week. Its sucks....but anyway. On top of this I take care of my sisters, clean the kitchen, do the laundry, clean my sisters room, clean my sisters playroom, empty one of the three litter boxes, clean up the dog poo outside, vacuum the house, clean the bathrooms, help my mom clean her room when she asks, pull the orders for my Mom's lil business, and any other little tasks that she asks. When I say "do the laundry" i don't mean just the washer and dryer, I mean that I have to fold them all ,which isn't such a big deal, and put everyone's clothes away. Everyone = Mom's, sisters's, and mine. I do my dad's too but that's cuz....well why not, i do everyone else's. My sister's are 8 and 6. Please tell me why they&nbsp;cannot do it themselves. They also have NO chores around the house. Well techincally Elizabeth (8) is supposed to empty the bathroom trash cans, but she can't even do that. GAH! It's annoying. Okay...I'm done whining..promise so I'm gunna go and that's all for now...I love you James and Shea. Thanks for being there!!!!

      This was on the "Tonight Show" with Jay Leno. Jay went into the audience to find the most embarrassing first date that a woman ever had. The winner described her worst first date experience. There absolutely no question as to why her tale took the prize!  Marilyn said it was midwinter... snowing and quite cold...and the guy had taken her skiing toLake Arrowhead. It was a day trip (no overnight). No, not Marilyn. They were strangers, after all, and truly had never met before. The outing was fun but relatively uneventful until they were headed home late that afternoon. They were driving back down the mountain, when she gradually began to realize that she should not have had that extra latte. They were about an hour away from anywhere with a rest room and in the middle of nowhere! Her companion suggested she try to hold it, which she did for awhile.  Unfortunately, because of the heavy snow and slow going, there came a point where she told him that he had better stop and let her pee beside the road, or it would be the front seat of his car. They stopped and she quickly crawled out beside the car, yanked her pants down and started. Unfortunately, in the deep snow she didn't have good footing, so she let her butt rest against the rear fender to steady herself.  Her companion stood on the side of the car watching for traffic and indeed was a real gentleman and refrained from peeking. All she could think about was the relief she felt despite the rather embarrassing nature of the situation.  Upon finishing however, she soon became aware of another sensation.  As she bent to pull up her pants, the young lady discovered her buttocks were firmly glued against the car's fender. Thoughts of tongues frozen to pump handles immediately came to mind as she attempted to disengage her flesh from the icy metal. It was quickly apparent that she had a brand new problem due to the extreme cold.  Horrified by her plight and yet aware of the humor she answered her date's concerns about "what was taking so long" with a reply that indeed, she was "freezing her butt off and needed some assistance"!  He came around the car as she tried to cover herself with her sweater and then, as she looked imploringly into his eyes, he burst out laughing. She too, got the giggles and when they finally managed to compose themselves, they assessed her dilemma. Obviously, as hysterical as the situation was, they also were faced with a real problem. Both agreed it would take something hot to free her chilly cheeks from the grip of the icy metal! Thinking about what had gotten her into the predicament in the first place, both quickly realized that there was only one way to get her free. So, as she looked the other way, her first time date proceeded to unzip his pants and pee her butt off the fender. As for the Tonight Show... she took the prize hands down... or perhaps that should be "pants down." And you thought your first date was embarrassing.  Jay Leno's comment - - - - This gives a whole new meaning to being "pissed off".

      "The Teacup"  There was a couple who used to go England to shop in a beautiful antique store. This trip was to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. They both liked antiques and pottery, and especially teacups.  Spotting an exceptional cup, they asked "May we see that?We've never seen a cup quite so beautiful."  As the lady handed it to them  the teacup suddenly  spoke, "You don't understand." It said, "I have not always been a teacup. There was a time when I was just a lump of red clay. My master took me and rolled me pounded and patted me over and over and I yelled out, 'Don't do that. I don't like it! Leave me alone,' but he only smiled, and gently said, 'Not yet!!'"  Then, WHAM!  I was placed on a spinning wheel and suddenly I was spun around and around and around. 'Stop it! I'm getting so dizzy!  I'm going to be sick!', I screamed. But the master only nodded and said, quietly; 'Not yet.'   He spun me and poked and prodded and bent me out of shape to suit himself and then..."Then he put me in the oven.  I never felt such heat.  I yelled and knocked and pounded at the door. 'Help! Get me out of here!' I could see him through the opening and I could read his lips as he shook his head from side to side, 'Not yet.'"  When I thought I couldn't bear it another minute, the door opened.He carefully took me out and put me on the shelf, and I began to cool. Oh, that felt so good!  'Ah, this is much better,' I thought.  "But, after I cooled he picked me up and he brushed and painted me all over. The fumes were horrible. I thought I would gag. 'Oh, please stop it, Stop it!!' I cried. He only shook his head and said. 'Not yet!'"  Then suddenly he put me back in to the oven.  Only it was not like the first one. This was twice as hot and I just knew I would suffocate.I begged. I pleaded. I screamed. I cried.  I was convinced I wouldnever make it.  I was ready to give up.  Just then the door openedand he took me out and again placed me on the shelf, where I cooled and waited ------- and waited, wondering what's he going to do to me next?"  An hour later he handed me a mirror and said 'Look at yourself.' And I did. "I said, 'That's not me; that couldn't be me.  It's beautiful.  I'mbeautiful!"' "Quietly he spoke: I want you to remember, then,' he said, 'I know it hurt to be rolled and pounded and patted, but had I just left youalone, you'd have dried up."'I know it made you dizzy to spin around on the wheel, but if I had stopped, you would have crumbled. "I know it hurt and it was hot and disagreeable in the oven, but if I hadn't put you there, you would have cracked. 'I know the fumes were bad when I brushed and painted you all over, but if I hadn't done that, you never would have hardened. You would not have had any color in your life. If I hadn't put you back in that second oven, you wouldn't have survived for long because the hardness would not have held. Now you are a finished product. Now you are what I had in mind when I first began with you.'"  The moral of this story is:God knows what He's doing [for each of us]. He is the potter, andwe are His clay. He will mold us and make us, and expose us to just enough pressures of just the right kinds that we may be made into a flawless piece of work to fulfill His good, pleasing and perfect will.   So when life seems hard, and you are being pounded and patted and pushed almost beyond endurance; when your world seems to be spinning out of control; when you feel like you are in a fiery furnace of trials; when life seems to "stink", try this....  Brew a cup of your favorite tea in your prettiest teacup, sit down and think on this story and then, have a little talk with the Potter.

      Your talented with reason, I’m listening to you screaming. I don’t doubt for a moment That you’ll get what you want.  So shape up or ship out, Get rid of all your doubt. You’re going far away And no one will stop you now.   Your ears, they’re burning, Your heart, well it’s yearning For just one simple reason To carry out your treason.  You’re the one and the only, It’s in your mind but you’re lonely. No one will suffice for what you’re seeking. It’s up to you now to find a way to get out. No one will stop you except for yourself. So don’t listen to the voices that tell you different, Because it’s the distance that they are jealous of.  So whisper your name into the wind, And perhaps it’ll fall on deaf ears of a forgotten friend. They never did listen to your dreams or decisions, So don’t you worry when they point you out. Don’t agonize about what your head thinks, It’ll just contradict what your heart feels. But it’s the blood on your wrist that’ll Make all of this seem real. And this is so real, so real… Can you taste it on the tip of your tongue? It’s more evident than the scars of each one Of those angles kiss’s on your arm.  ....hahaha...no I didn't write it. This guy who lives in Texas did. His name is Taylor. *shrugs* I just had an inkling to put it in here.

      Martha = Martha Stuart or however its spelled  Maxine = that grouchy old comic lady  Martha's Way  Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips.  Maxine's Way  Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone, for Pete's sake! You are probably lying on the couch with your feet up eating it, anyway!  Martha's Way   To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag with the potatoes.  Maxine's Way  Buy Hungry Jack mashed potato mix and keep it in the pantry for up to a year.  Martha's Way   When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan, use a bit of the dry cake mix instead and there won't be any white mess on the outside of the cake  Maxine's Way  Go to the bakery! They'll even decorate it for you.  Martha's Way   If you accidentally oversalt a dish while it's still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant "fix-me-up."  Maxine's Way  If you oversalt a dish while you are cooking, that's too bad. Please recite with me the real woman's motto: "I made it and you will eat it and I don't care how bad it tastes!"   Martha's Way  Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting in the refrigerator and it will keep for weeks.  Maxine's Way  Celery? Never heard of it!  Martha's Way  Brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish.  Maxine's Way  The Mrs. Smith frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the crust so I don't.  Martha's Way  Cure for headaches: take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away.  Maxine's Way  Take a lime, mix it with tequila, chill and drink!  Martha's Way  If you have a problem opening jars, try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a non-slip grip that makes opening jars easy.  Maxine's Way  Go ask that very cute neighbor if he can open it for you.  Martha's Way  Don't throw out all that leftover wine. Freeze into ice cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces.  Maxine's Way  Leftover wine???????? HEL-LO !!!!!.
