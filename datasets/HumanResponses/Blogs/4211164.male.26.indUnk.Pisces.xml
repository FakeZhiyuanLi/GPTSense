      The Mullets... i came up with the name from the ocean fish the mullet. for years Cal and I made great music together and with various other people. In 2000 CAl and I lived together in a small cramped one bedroom apartment near the University. We oftentimes would play into the nigt in the bedroom and eventually a very cool band would come of it. by chance Cal met Thom who lived across the parking lot from our home. If i recall correctly they met while Cal was doing laundry. THom liked the came music as Cal and was a very good musician we soon found. Thom was a good guy, real quiet and smart. he studyed at the university and we hung out many nights drinking and plaing music in the room. Since Thom was very good at plying guitar CAl and I decided that it would be in all of our best interests to make music as a band. at a party we met taylor and since drummers are scarce around here and always have been, we decided on Taylor to fill the drummer spot since he was an ok drummer and we all had the same interests in music. I had known Taylor for a few years and hung out with him alot. After introducing him to Cal and Thom at a party I pitched him with the idea of a Rock band. He was down for it and thats when it started.   After a few sessions together in the small bedroom we knew that we needed a larger space to spread out and get creative. we settled on the closest rehersal studio to us. we got workin, and made some great music. most of the songs we had were my originals that i wrote in the years prior. the songs we created together as a band were from my strict rule of open creativity. we all put in our ideas and that worked very well. we did some Social Distortion Covers and the sound was great. we made friends with the other bands in the rehersal studios and with those friendships we made way to playing live.  I think our first show was at a local record shop. soon bigger shows came. the pictures posted here are from a Dallas show we did in Deep Ellum. The sound was always great in the Dallas clubs. we didnt play a whole lot of shows, only a handful. we recorded alot of the music but is sad that little remains, most of the recordings are lost somewhere.  I found that all great things find a test that leads to greatness or failure. we Failed horribly. After a year or so, and jsut when the music was developing into something great disaster hit hard. Taylor always had a huge ego and we usually were able to keep his uncontrolable ego in check. but with a meglomaniac there is only so much you can handel before its too much. we got sick of it and it sparked our downfall. I dont quite remember the last days, i think i blocked them from my memory but it wasnt good. eventually Thom dissapeared and Cal and I severed ties with Taylor. and as quickly as it came, it was gone.  Cal and I in our spare time are trying to salvage what recordings we have. the good news is that Cal and I continue to make music when time allows us to. There are still lots of songs to be created and put together.
