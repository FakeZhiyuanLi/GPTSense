      Today is one of those days, you know the ones that start horrible but then something happens and all of a sudden you can see the day for the beautiful thing it is. I should probably start by recapping last night. Two of my best friends in the entire world came to visit. One of which almost literally met me at my front door after work. So of course that leads to a night in the city. The nights to remember. Spirits soared, women swooned, and Gods were created. Not a bad way to spend an evening huh?   However like all beautiful things it had to come to an end. And the end of it crashed headstrong into the beginning of my workday. Without warning, without prejudice, and without remorse.   So needless to say, my morning was a complete blur of numbers, passcodes, protocall, policies, proceedures, compliance, etc.... all occuring at once around me, and me in the middle trying to remember if I really just heard my boss say "balls". As in lets get the balls rolling. Ok so sometimes I still act like a 3rd grader. But you can probably imagine the numb, juvinile state of mind I was in.   This feeling of jubilance was immediately followed by the foggy depression of a hangover. And It was a doozy. I haven't felt like that since college. Here were my main thoughts. (By the way I must warn you that I am a little neurotic.)  1) Holy crap dude, I spent so much money last night. I shouldn't have done that. I am so irresponsible.  2) I feel like I was loud and obnoxious last night. Everyone is probably either mad at me or they just don't like me anymore.  3) why are you such a loser, your a grown 24 year old man. with a job in investments and a nice apartment in the city. If you keep doing this stuff your going to end up on COPS running down the street drunk, hooked on meth, with no teeth, no shirt and no deoderant. Asking the cops "why y'all hasslin' me, why y'all.....watch my head, watch my head."    So thats a peek into how not right the functions in my head are.   Anyway I was coming back from lunch and stepped outside into beautiful uptown Charlotte, took a deep breath and my hangover melted. Filled my nostrils with the smells of spring, smiled big and headed back to work... it's good to be alive today.

      Last night my roommate and I played at a local open mic. It was fun but I wished it had been better circumstances. I say this only because I felt like I didn't play very well. For instance,  we didn't get to play until after midnight, and by then I wasn't sober :) But again it was fun. Not so fun this morning though. I honestly am a different person than I was about a year ago. I used to party and stay out every night, but I don't do that anymore. Last night was just one of those nights where the stars align just right :) I'm glad I did it. Got out of the apartment for a while and experienced some culture :) Tonight...................... I sleep!

      This weekend I hopped in my car and drove to my home town of Mooresville. I wanted to empty my head and finish some of these songs I have been writing for the better part of a year. It helped. It's funny how some of the streets had changed but others felt like I had never left. It felt as though I were riding to school (high school) with my brother and I had done it the day before, and the day before that etc... I guess I miss those days. I saw all the places I played as a kid, and again some were different, some were unchanged, and others were now parking lots. Then My life shot into fast forward as I drove back to Charlotte. I am happy where I am now. Anyway the point of this ramble is, I finally opened my head enough to write, and what I put down so far is nice. I tended to write "bigger" when I lived there. Why?  I don't know. Maybe I was compensating for the size of the town. :) But somehow I caught that feeling again. Maybe I will go again next weekend.

      Ok, I have been feeling great today, I have had a spring in my step, and air about me, a certain "Je ne sais quoi." Well I was on my way back from lunch and I hopped on the elevator and found a packed house. So I squeeze into the middle of the crowd and push "5." As I do, I notice that floors 2-5 have all been pushed, I think to myself "oh well I can wait, I'm in a good mood and no hurry. Just as I think that, the lady behind me (and when I say behind I mean "close") sneezes all over my back. I was like "uhhhhh what the hell was that about." The gross thing about it was the noise. It was the sort of sneeze that dislodges some crap in your throat, and it turns into a half sneeze half cough sort of thing. I gagged... Now I'm gonna be sick because capt. Kleenex couldn't keep her fluids to herself. Not in such a good mood anymore.

      In reading a friends blog about an annoying person whom he sits next to at work, I started thinking about all the stuff that goes on around me on a daily basis. I came up with a "few" annoying things. If anyone reading this is familiar with cubicle life, you will know that it can be a "close" quarters type experience. The company I work for has the short walled cubes, so not only am I face to face with my neighbors, I am also subjected to all their idiosyncrasies in an unrelenting manner. The girl who sits directly to my right, loves to listen to the radio. She listens through headphones so as not to "disturb" anyone. However she has a tendency to boisterously laugh at any tid bit of humor that the morning disc jockey can dish out, disturbing everyone. She will periodically burst into bouts of laughter in which the tones produced are no less annoying than that of fingernails being scraped down a chalkboard. She is obviously the biggest fan of this morning show, and wants the world to know it. Well, at least her co-workers... How funny could it be? That's my question. I have never been so caught off gaurd by the "hilarity" of a disc Jockey that I laugh out loud. But that's me. Directly behind me I have a woman that is not content simply setting the phone down after a call,  she likes to slam it onto the base and then do that little "slide it all around until you find the receiver slot," game. If the initial slam doesn't startle and annoy you enough the pleasant plastic on plastic friction noise definitely will. She applies this same technique to her typing. She punishes the keys in a cacophonous medley of finger slams, coupled with the agonizing harmony created by fingers being drug over the keyboard during the transition from one letter to the next. Each letter burns into my eardrums. The kind of annoyance that I can only equate to a pesky mosquito flying into your ear canal unexpectedly.  Then there is the guy in front of me who I refer to as the repeater. In any given situation he can be heard repeating fragments of statements made by persons of authority. I don't know if he does this to make the manager think that he was thinking the same exact thing or what, but irregardless it's pretty horrible. I will give you an example. Manager: Ok, guys we have been doing pretty well since this conversion but I still think some people don't quite understand the NAO documents.   Repeater: (nodding) the NAO documents. Manager: When dealing with these it is important to remember to contact the FA.   Repeater: (almost at the same time) Contact the FA.    See what I mean? Sometimes it's so bad I feel like I am really stoned, and am hearing everything twice. This same guy is also guilty of reiterating the same jokes and one liners day after day. He constantly makes comments about how often I make trips to the printer to pick up "documents" (mostly guitar tablature or interesting articles about homeland security and how to make the perfect quiche, but documents nonetheless). It started as "man, they got you workin'. Your gonna lose weight as much as you go to the printer, hahaha." Now it is an everyday "your losin' weight, I can tell..haha." I wonder if he still thinks it's as funny as he makes it out to be each time he says it. Then there is the lady to my left. She is a rare specimen. She is from up north and probably one of the loudest talkers on the planet. The sheer volume of her voice is mind boggling. It's as if every one of her sentences is punctuated with two or more exclamation points. Even if it's a mundane story about where she went for lunch. Such as " I HAD QUIZNO'S TODAY!!!" or "I LOVE BACON BITS IN SALAD!!" Her mother obviously never taught her the importance and/or appropriateness of using an "inside voice." The annoyance of her volume is paled only by the stupidity of the things she says. She has a 13 year old daughter, as anyone in a three state radius could tell you by now, and constantly says things only current N' Sync fanatics would deem acceptable. Picture a 40 something year old woman asking you what the "DEELY!!" is, or saying things like "YES, NO, MAYBE SO" when asked if she will be finished processing her work before the market closes. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think "OBOKAYBE BABY!!" has ever been an acceptable response to any question in corporate America. In fact I will be happy if I never hear it again, in any America. And please don't tell me your remit Report was "EASY PEASY 1,2, THREESY!!" It wouldn't surprise me if she did her reports with numerous, different colored markers, and drew little hearts on her day planner with crayons. Seriously.   So there I am in the middle of four really annoying people, clinging to what sanity I have left. I'm the yin to their yang, the Switzerland to their rest of the world. All of them: Laughey, Slammey, Repeater and sophomoric are working together to make each 8 hr day seem like a 16 hr day. I am trying to not get annoyed, but right now they are winning by a long shot. Who needs a drink?

      Well I think I made up my mind. (by the way sorry I haven't updated in a while.) I think I have made the decision to start playing shows again. I have been pretty excited about some of the songs I have been writing and I think it might be fun to do one show a week. I am also kicking around the idea of putting out a solo CD. This has been a long time coming and I feel like I need that feeling in my life again. Performing. Anyway that's about all I have been thinking about lately so I apologize for not writing a more in depth, thoughtful entry. :) I'm done for today.

      I was just reading John Kerry's website, and he had a comment in there that I think constituted a rebuttle. Kerry stated that " It's hard to imagine how the commission investigating the 2001 terrorist attacks could have put it more clearly yesterday: there was never any link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, between Saddam Hussein and Sept. 11." He then goes on to say that "president Bush should apologize to the American people, who were led to beleive something different."  Now, regardless of where you stand on political issues and issues of homeland security, I think there are some basic facts that cannot be ignored. 1. Saddam Hussein was a Tyrannical, Narcissistic, Insane ruler who controlled his people through fear. Of course the blatently liberal media still focuses on the tiny percentage of Saddam loyalists, and fails to show what was, and is, really going on there. There was a story in a magazine not too long ago that told of Saddam (or as he prefers to be called "his excellency, presidant Saddam Husien, Servant of God, Beleiver, Leader of all muslims) and how he had his sons (Uday and Qusay), murder a political opponent when the boys were only 15 and 13. Not to mention one of the sons peroidically jailing the Iraqi soccer team when they lost, or the hordes of people executed for the reason of overcrowded prisons. I mean this man and his gold palaces are anything but sane.  2. Saddam and Al Qaeda were connected. Maybe not in planning the 9/11 attacks but there is concrete evidence of communications between the two. I know that sounds vague but if you beleive like I do, you will agree that communications are scary, especially when the main thing these two entities have in common is their hatred of America. As far as I'm concerned that would have led to problems sooner or later. Anyone who doesn't see that is either in denial or just plain nieve. I don't know about you guys but I think the American people should be thanking our president. For reputation, for not being pushed around when told we couldn't search missle silos (Clinton's slaps on the wrist) and for sticking to his "guns" when faced with adversity. So on behalf of everyone who doesn't consider the environment a make or break issue, I say Thank you George W.&nbsp; Keep up the good work. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am done now. I'm spent.

      It seems that some people believe (the American Civil Liberties Union) that it would be a good idea to remove the crosses from the Los Angeles County Flag. This tiny section of the flag displays crosses to represent the areas settlement by Spanish missionaries. This seems ludicrous. I mean, while their at it, they might as well change the name of the county. "Los Angeles" (the angels), that sounds spiritually rooted to me. Apparently L.A. county is not separating church and state. Apparently the crosses are an "impermissible endorsement of Christianity." I say if you remove the crosses you will be turning your back on historical facts and on the origin of the area. Its not intended to alienate non- Christians, or to convert anyone. It's simply paying homage to it's past. I say let it fly, crosses and all.

      Last night I had dinner With my roommate and his girlfriend and her roommate ( if that makes sense) at their house. I hadn't seen them (Tracey and Rosa) in a while so dinner was delightful. It really put me in a great mood. My roommate (Adam) summed it up though. He said it's like another family unit. I agree. They are all great friends and incredible people.  That's all I've got to say for today :)

      This country is filled with absolute morons. I swear to god. It makes me question the validity of social Darwinism. How could people as ignorant as some of the people I interact with everyday, have made it as long as they have without making fatal blunders. I don't know, I feel like if their ancestors were half as stupid as they are, they should have gotten trampled by woolly mammoths while trying make snow angels.  	Here are some examples of the " intelligence" produced by the mental giants I spend my days with.  	Exhibit A:   My fellow associates and I are celebrating the birthday of a one Kelly Johnson (different name , protecting the innocent). While partaking in the traditional birthday party trappings, the young man sitting next to me asks, or as he put it aks,  if I enjoyed strawberry shortcake. Well it took me a good 15 mins of deep deciphering and code breaking to finally understand what the hell he had said to me. The intended question was: "excuse me sir, I couldn't help but wonder if you have had any strawberry shortcake lately, and whether or not it was enjoyable to your pallet. I do enjoy a good strawberry shortcake every now and again ."   The way the question came out was " Ay man, you like scrawberry shotecake, I love me some scrawberries. in a cake, in a pie, erythang."   	Now I am no baker, nor do I claim to know everything in the ways of baked pastries, but I honestly was unaware of the existence of strawberry pie. Maybe there is a strawberry pie, who knows, but there is definitely no such thing as a freakin' scrawberry. 	This raises the question, "Where in this mans life did everything go wrong." I mean it might have been cute for a little baby to say scrawberry, but all I am saying is that if the kid is still mispronouncing the word at age 18, it's time to intervene. But here is the other question, "does the parent know the correct pronunciation?"  If it turns out that they don't, then you, by default, have to assume that his father couldn't say it correctly and neither could his grandfather, and so on and so on. So, to prove my point, by that rational you have to assume that if his family has an innate problem with pronouncing the very simple "st" sound it should have created some potentially fatal problems throughout life. 	Let me give you some examples of what I mean: "Before you jump, make sure your parachute is strapped."  A common sentence heard the world around everyday. However as our "hero" is awaiting a jump from an airplane, trying to remember everything the instructor told him on the ground, he would remember that sentence and say it to himself as, " Before you jump make sure your parachute is scrapped." Which could pose to be a very messy situation. Darwinism. 	Or as a child he would repeat his mothers warnings and say to himself  "I shouldn't play in the screet, now if I only knew where that was I could avoid it." at that very moment his ball rolls into the street and not aware of the dangers, he bolts out in front of a car. Darwinism. 	Or to take it back to the original. "oh none for me thanks, I am deathly allergic to scrawberries."     than the host of the party says "oh thats fine, because these things are strawberries."  Hero: "oh ok, I'll take a plate then." Darwinism. 	So those are just a few examples of how mispronunciation and ignorance should have weeded these people out decades ago. But I guess there has to be people who are so dumb, it makes us moderately intelligent people stand out as brilliant. :)    I'm done now. I hope you like my scory.  :)

      This was written before I started my page. But it is a true story nonetheless.               So I'm eating my croissant this morning and it's a pretty flakey. And I don't mean unreliable. I mean Flakey. I am munching away and realize that the flakes are overwhelming and all over my desk. I mean it looked like a small woodland creature had been snacking on some spruce while I was away from my desk. So I brush them off as best as I can, but you never can be too sure where or when the flakes might resurface. Well I found out when, but not how. My supervisor came to my desk to talk to me about something, I wasn't paying attention, because as she approached me I noticed that the form she was coming to talk to me about had a flake on it. which is fine, I mean no big deal.... well this particular flake was not as brown as the rest of the pastry it was more golden in color and very much resembled a booger.      Now being the fast reactor that I am I tried to pick up the paper and toss off the crumb before she got there. Somehow the flake had been fused to the paper, maybe I set something on it...........the crumb didn't fall off... instead it looked like I was trying to hand the form to my supervisor, so she took it out of my hands and started asking me something about interest adjustments but I couldn't think b/c my eyes were glued to the crumb booger, praying it would fall off with all her hand gestures..well it didn't.... so she thanked me for taking care of that issue for her and took the booger paper back to her desk.....She is going to look it over and discover the boog and think I am dirty, and a nose picker. Now do I email her and say if she finds anything on the paper, it's a pastry crumb, no of course not...... I am forever going to be the booger guy. she will probably tell all the other managers about it as a funny anecdote at the annual managers bowling party.............I don't think they have that but you know what I mean.... Why does this stuff always happen to me? I hate my life. :)

      Most people my age will tell you that they don't miss high school or junior high, but I do. A lot. I miss how it felt. How everything felt back then. There was not a care in the world. It was a time of excitement and "firsts" for me. Especially with relationships (if you want to call them relationships, back then they were pretty short lived)The first time you held hands with a girl, your first slow dance, your first kiss. Remember how exciting it was to just sit next to a girl you liked. Will that feeling ever come back? I hope it does. I mean is that how you know you've found the right one?................. Just thinking.

      So this morning I had a realization. I am in love with a morning news anchor. Shannon to be more exact. I can't believe I feel this way. I see her out and about on the streets in the am, visiting all the favorite morning spots of the viewers. See they write in and tell the station what their favorite morning places are and Shannon goes and visits them. I picture us in those places, laughing together and enjoying our morning. Like today she was at a Tae Kwon Do academy, and I could only imagine the two of us together, punching and spin kicking each other deeper into love. One morning she was playing Laser Tag, and of course I wanted to be there running and hiding from her, trying to act like my gun was broken so she could win. We spend every morning together.One time Shannon and I visited A blue grass band/family, we had a ball, pickin' and a grinnin'.Sharing music together as a couple, while I brushed my teeth. We even rode a racecar once......  Uhhhhhh, Quick question though...... who in the HELL likes to go to these places in the morning? Laser tag? Never in my entire existence have I awoke in the morning and had a dire need to go play laser tag. Let alone Tae Kwon Do. Who ever these people are they need to re- evaluate their morning schedules. Holy Crap! Maybe I'm just not a morning person. Or maybe I don't appreciate the value of each and every day. But I do appreciate one thing, and that is my Tae Kwon Do, Laser Tag, Blue Grass, and racecar free mornings......................... But of course....love make you do crazy things. So, for now, I will continue to spend my mornings with Shannon. Wherever it takes me. Tomorrow: Morning Deep Sea Diving. I'll be there bright and early with my wet suit. *sigh*

      I got a little teary today. Not because I was sad, in fact, it was the exact opposite. I don't know a lot about life and why stuff happens the way it does, but everything that happens leads to something else. Whatever decisions you make ultimately effect the outcome (I believe that is some sort of positive offshoot of the Chaos Theory). :) I knew that already but I've never heard it put so plainly and poetically as I did this afternoon. I was listening to Ben Folds and heard a couple lines that made me really happy and grateful:  I don't get many things right the first time In fact, I'm told that a lot but Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and the falls brought me here and I know  That I am I am I am The luckiest  I know that I might feel I have made some wrong choices in my life, but if I hadn't made them, I definitely would be somewhere else as a slightly different person. I don't want that because I am happy here. I wouldn't have it any other way.

      There is a certain girl, that I work with, who has made it as clear as possible, without actually saying it, that she doesn't like me. Worst of all, she is on my team. I constantly try to think of some reason I might have given her to dislike me. I can't think of any. I am always polite, I am always professional. I mean everyone else I work with seems to be ok with me. In fact I would consider some of them to be pretty close friends. I guess I am guilty of the same thing. I mean when I meet someone, sometimes they just rub me the wrong way and I don't care for them. I cant quite put my finger on why I don't care for them, I just don't. Maybe I am that person to her. Maybe the first time we met she realized that I was not the kinda person she cared for. It kinda sucks though. I mean I am a realist, I understand that not everyone is going to like you all the time, but I can't understand why I get the cold shoulder. This is borderline childish. (ie not holding the elevator door for me, keeping any paperwork that is supposed to come to me.) She has been a part of this team for a long time, and I am fairly new. I can't help but wonder if maybe I took the job that she has been wanting. That's the only thing I can think of. If that's the case, than grow up, you know? I am very sorry that I took a position that you were interested in but hey, too bad. I don't know. It's like, you obviously didn't get it for a reason. They don't just overlook people who have been on the team for like 7 years, there is a reason that you have yet to make an upward move on the company totem pole, and it's probably because you are childish and don't play well with others. That is a very unbecoming trait. I believe in the philosophy that you are bound for success as long as you have a good personality. I know that sounds hokey, but seriously, no one wants to work with an asshole, no matter how smart they are. They want to work with people that they can actually stand to be around. I believe that. That sounds uneducated, but in the grand scheme of things it's not far from the honest truth. I mean degrees and accolades are good but if your a stiff, and sterile during your interview, I can almost guarantee that you won't get the job. If you are personable, articulate, humorous, and fun than I feel that you would be more likely to end up with the job.  My only advise to the girl that hates me..... lighten up, it's not so bad. Who knows maybe I will let you sit in my chair at MY desk and see exactly what it is I do on a daily basis, I could train you on how to do it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bitch............hahaha :)&nbsp;

      It's dreary here today, but I love it. I always pray for rain. I don't know why but there is a cozy, lazy feeling about rainy days that I love. It might be my natural indolent tendencies, that make me feel content when it's raining :)  Today, when it finally starts to rain, I am going to sit on the porch and watch. I need to get out of my cubicle first though :)   Thoreau -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow-storms and rain-storms and I did my duty faithfully.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Walden)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

      I don't normally write twice in one day but I had to get this out. I left for lunch today like I always do..... I go home for lunch because I live pretty close.... Watched a little Riki Lake, had a bite to eat and headed back to work a little earlier than normal to finish up some stuff I had to do from this morning. I hop in my car and go.... as I am rounding a turn that goes under a bridge, I see something that makes me scared.  I should preface this with the comment that living in the city you see some pretty weird stuff. But today was outrageous. I saw a crack head YELLING at the under side of the bridge. Not only was he yelling, but he was making threatening motions to it like it was talking Shit to him. I had to take a second look to see if maybe there was someone there he was yelling at, but there wasn't. It almost looked like he was frantically calling&nbsp;the&nbsp;bridge itself&nbsp;to come over to him, and then after realizing that&nbsp;it wasn't coming, he'd would get furious and want to fight it.  Wow that was intense. Who the hell would want to smoke crack? I mean if it makes you like that than whats the point.  I don't know.... anyway I thought it was something that should be told. I had no Idea but apparently crack heads and bridges do not like each other very much. I guess cuz the bridges refuse to come when you call them. Which actually, now that I think about it, is understandable.

      The other day my roommate and I went to our old house where our third roommate, at the time, still lives, to say hey and gather some of our belongings that were left behind. (was that a run-on sentence?) Anyway, Adam, my roommate, picked up some mail and found his father had sent him a $40 gift certificate to a restaurant called the Cajun Queen. I had some doubts considering that the city I live in is by no means "Cajun" nor is this part of the state, or world for that matter, known for it's Cajun cuisine. But considering that at the current moment our only dinner plans for the night consisted of beer, and Salt and Pepper sandwiches, I decided that a warm meal, for free, would do me good. So we went. When we arrived we found the restaurant to be nothing more than an old house. There was an elderly woman, with horrible hygiene, out front asking us to wait before we took to the front steps. This request came because a friend of hers was on the narrow staircase and not feeling well. My roommate and I immediately looked at each other and both thought the exact same thing, I hope this illness is not a result of the food inside. So Adam, being the go getter he is, asked loudly "It's not because of the food is it?" The first lady replied that it wasn't and just as quickly as this strange occurrence started.... It was over. In looking back I feel that there is a logical explanation, and here it is: In gathering evidence from my surrounding these two woman were witches, trust me if you would have seen them, where and when we did you would definitely agree. Anyway they lived in, and owned, this restaurant, and the ill one was only sick because she had not consumed any children in a while. I feel that this is the logical and only explanation.  Anyway, we decided to go for it and went inside. Upon stepping through the door my fear of witches and food poisoning, vanished. I found myself in the middle of a very convivial situation. An exciting atmosphere fueled by a live jazz trio, good food and plenty of drinks. We ate, great food by the way, had a glass of wine and listened to jazz, simply marinating in the joy of this hidden treasure we had unearthed. I want to go after work everynight now, and take in this almost surreal world, of pure jazz and pure company.  If we had never gone to get mail and such, from our old house, we might never have found this gem. I guess the point of this story is.... Check your mail..... Please people......even old mail....You might just find a cool jazz bar? ....... oh yea and don't be scared of witches. That's the other point. I have to work now.  Love,  Rob

      When did it happen? I got a call from 2 friends last night that I haven't really seen or spoken to since high school. Both of which are getting married. What the hell. I mean what's the rush right? Then I remembered the ages of me and mine. We are about that age. Ok so we are that age. Even still it is a shock to hear.  Maybe it's because I haven't seen them in so long, I still picture them as the awkward teens that we all were at that time, that the news comes as such a surprise. I start to remember things about "high school" and "junior High" us. The last minute, unorganized plans we made to try and party at someones house. The late night runs to Waffle House. Bad decisions, Good decisions, football games, cliques, people we should have been nicer to that are now probably running the government, Dances, substitute teacher harassment. Wow come to think of it, I was an asshole. Either way that was a different time, we were different people. But I still can't picture the guy who once ate out of the trash to win a bet, engaged. Or the guy who used to be obsessed with Kriss Kross, in love. I wonder if the the groomsmen will be wearing starter jerseys with starter jackets over them, backwards. Or maybe at the start of the reception the groom will kick it off by saying.... Yo Vanilla, Kick it one time boyeeee!! I'm sure the first dance will be to color me bad's "I adore, Mi Amore." I'm sorry that's not fair, I mean I changed, so I assume they did as well. Life is crazy. I gotta work now so I'm done for the day.

      That's it. I'm done. I'm outta here for the day, it's already ruined. People never cease to amaze me. I am shocked daily by the audacity and over all lack of tact displayed by some people. Let me tell you what happened: I arrive at work and, like always, I get situated at my desk. This usually leads to morning salutations and mindless chit chat. The normal office banter, "good morning, how are ya'?", "did you watch (insert favorite TV show here) last night?" blah blah. I was feeling especially tired this morning so after I had said my hellos to everyone I decided to grab a nice hot cup of coffee. So I leave my seat and head to the break room. Along the way I am smiling and saying hi to people passing by, "Hey Al, Mornin' John, Mike, How are ya'?   Good Good. Gonna be a hot one."  I then pass a girl whose name I will not divulge, and she looks at me and says, " what's up Rob?" She then grabs my side and says, "your getting a little thick aren't ya?" Ok, now at what point did it become acceptable to make a comment like that. Hey how about "what's up Rob, Holy shit your fat!" or "what's up Rob, how was the cow you had for dinner last night." or "what's up Rob how do you manage to make it to work on time when you have so much body to wash in the morning." or "what's up Rob, is it genetics or an overall food obsession that makes you so tubby?" or "what's up Blob, I mean Rob, haha did I say Blob? I meant Rob." or "what's up Rob, besides your cholesterol?"  There is not much difference between what she said to me and the comments I just typed. God almighty where the hell was this girl raised. You don't just say that to someone.  Well that's it for my day. I'll just sit here and try to suck in the gut. Damn it!!!! today started out good..... Hey thanx for the observation bitch!!!!! In another life as another person I might have said that, instead I think the only thing I could utter was a "yup" followed by a head jerk at the realization at what she had just said to me. If you want to find my self esteem... it's on the bottom of that girls shoe. Damn she's mean.

      Crap dude!! Yesterday I was pulling into a parking space at my apartment complex, and I accidentally snagged a little of this poor guys bumper. I was trying to get in as quick as I could, because someone was pulling out and I was obstructing his view of oncoming traffic. See this was the very front spot as you pull off the main road, making a left, on your right side. Does that make sense. In other words the spot is so close to the main road, that in making my left I was leaving the person pulling out of the complex with no visual to his left.  Anyway no one saw me do this, however me being the honest, self respecting, guy I am (*sarcasm* the real reason is that I would have had the worlds biggest anxiety attack about the cops looking for me on hang gliders and in helicopters, or even the swat team plotting the attack on my apartment in attempt to bring down the infamous hit and run bandit) I left a note on his window with all the #'s where I can be reached. This happened at 5:30 pm yesterday and as of yet (4:23 pm today) I have not heard from him . Perhaps he looks at it the way I do. It was an accident and the damage is too minimal to even worry about.  That or he is assembling a team of attorneys, including Johnny Cochran and the guy defending Micheal Jackson, to bleed me of every cent I am worth. Which at the current moment wouldn't please a homeless person. But either way, he won't rest until the guilty are punished accordingly. Stepping on any and all in his path that try to slow his dismantling of my entire family. Fueled by the memory of his beloved outback, broken and bashed, left for dead in a parking lot. With nothing except the love of it's owner keeping it alive. Trying to honk for help but in it's current condition could only muster an almost inaudible beep...... I'm gonna bet on the first explanation for the lack of a call. I will keep you posted on the action. This is Robert Tremblay reporting for channel 5 news, your source for the newest of the new, news first. Or something like that.

      This morning is beautiful. It kinda feels like and early fall morning. It is literally inspiring. I feel like a renaissance man. I feel like sitting outside and writing a poem, or a song, reading a play, or painting a picture. It feels so much like the early days of school, that on my way to the office, I had this overwhelming feeling that I was in college walking to class. The way the air smelled, the sleepiness of my surroundings. I should've taken today off. I would have spent the day outside, soaking it up. Don't get me wrong I am sure it will eventually be hot today, and then I would've wanted to be inside, in the AC. If I could make everyday feel like this I would in a heartbeat. Now I have to go, and hope this day in a cube goes quickly. Bye for now.

      Have you ever done something so embarrassing, that you tried a little too hard to pretend you meant to do it? Let me explain what I mean: I was on the elevator with about 7 people, 4 of which work on my floor, and in my department. I see and interact with these people everyday. Well the elevator stops on 3 and 2 people get off. I notice that the elevator panel has 4 and 5 pressed (5 being our floor). I don't know what the hell I was thinking but as the elevator  slowed at 4, I started getting ready to get off. The door opens and I walk off, with one other lady, nonchalantly. I get about halfway out the door when I realize it's the wrong floor, so instead of being the ass that hops back in the elevator and says something like "whoa, hahaha, still early, haha" I keep on keeping on. I took it as far as waiting in the 4th floor lobby a little while (about 6 mins) then heading up to 5 where I countered each question from every one of the 4 people on the lift with me, with, "oh yea, I have a buddy on 4 who wanted to borrow a cd, so I was taking it to him." God I am a loser and now a liar. I should have just said, "yea I don't know what happened, I'm an idiot." At least that would've been funny right? Anyway I guess no one was harmed. Except for my imaginary buddy who never got the CD :)

      I ordered a book from amazon.com, Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot." I paid for expedited shipping and didn't receive my book until 11 days later. I contacted Amazon.com and the seller (kingsgate books) and told them of my plight. This morning I arrive at the office with 2 emails. One from the seller and one from Amazon. They told me that they agreed that my service was unsatisfactory and that they were giving me a full refund. Oh, America the beautiful. Not only can I read one of the greatest plays in recent history (written in 1948), but I also get to do so for free. That's an awesome way to start the day.
