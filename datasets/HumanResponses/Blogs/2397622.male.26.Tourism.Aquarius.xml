      Hello, here am I agan...After my terrible experience in L.A this weekend....Why do I trust on people so bad? Why do I share my feelings when I dont even know the person? Am I stupid, old fashioned or what? I really dont know...What I can say is that Im frustrated, dissapointed and tired of being such a romantic person...Nowadays nothing works like that anymore...Fuck the hell, but thats life right now...Everyone is a jerk...Dam it!!! I had this weird feeling that something was going to happen...WHy should I follow my instincts? They always tell me something! With the news that I had in LA, it seemed that I crashed a wall, or some blocks felt inside my brain....but life moves on....but I dont feel like going out anymore...At least yestardey I bought a new winter jacket....so I was happy about it... I will write more later...I have some stuff to do...wine tasting this afternoon!!! cool...Im going with my friend francois in this really fancy place!! lets see...I dont want to get drunk! Ciao

      Hey guys...how have you been? I dissapeard! I know..Yesterday was my birthday..It was good, my brother is here visitng me and we are having a good time....It's so nice having someone from my family here!!! I've been feeling so lonely and weird...A lot of things are coming to my head...I was talking to minette yesterday and both of us are feeling the same way..Lonely... no love...no kindness..words that ahould fill our hearts when we love someone and we are feeling exactly the opposit....or when we are loved...I've been thinking of moving somewhere or moving to a different country...Im bored of san diego,bored of the same people and bored of having this kind of life...I dont even have the anxiety to go out anymore...Can you believe? me, marcello, thinking those things? Yeah, I think thats Marcello 2004....alone and with other plans.. I think of the fact of being single and missing my family made me think that I need someone real, or a real life...in these moments you stop to think and realize what have you done and what should you do... I was thinking today in a lot of stuff and I was putting everything on the table and I realized that I only had my past relationships because I was afraid of being alone, for the fact that I dont have anyone here, just friends....Thats whats bothers me and pisses me off.Im always afraid of being alone...Why???Thats a question that I have to figure it ot by myself..I probably need to start looking for someone that is real, from another country or somewhere out there that has someone with a good heart-soul....I dont know...or probably I need to change myself, be more open-minded and accept people's feelings...thoughts...be more down to earth... I miss laughing, huggind, feeling warm...having tears in my eyes when you feel your heart beating so fast for the person you love....God gives me strengh, because I have been felling so weird lately...  I think all this fact of my brother getting married and all this love that my family has for each other and all the care that they have is making me feel down...feel alone..feel lost.... but as always...I have to deal with it... At work everything is doing fine...I think Im getting bored too...Nothing changes..nothing challenging...I dont know...maybe its me...whatever.. Keep in touch!!!!!!!! I will write later on!

      Im tired of babysitting people....oh my god...my work is driving me crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to think and do things for everybody...I thought 2004 was going to be an year where people would be more creative and out step out of their own little brain, but it seems that that was just my wish...shit...Im frustrated...I have to remember everyday what people have to do and stuff.... I wasnt born to be a baby sitter... 2004 started good..anyway..... I ended it up going to riches and doing nothing...some crazy drunk people started grabbing me all over but that doesnt work with me....whatever.... I have more stuff to do....I catch up later

      What is my life all about? I woke up in a weird mude today...I dont know why...Probably its because I miss love, I miss a warm hug, I miss a real kiss...Im sad today... I was thinking in a lot of things today...a lot of things came up to my head, moving or maybe look for a another job. I dont feel that I have been having a normal life,a happy one..Im not happy at all..I just work, party and I end it up all the time not enjoying my own personal thoughts,my desires...I dont have anything that gives me pleasure, the real way of living and enjoying life... My life has been pure ice...and Im the only one that has the assets to change it...Everytime that Im not happy with something, I want to move out....why? I really dont know...Why do I always wanna do that? Maybe is something that I have been living...a Lie... I have been missing my family a lot....my brothers, my dad....The real love..the ones that will always be there for you, no matter what ( at least I hope after all that happened)... I will start reading today....I also have to do all my reviews today at work, today is my last day.... Take care

      hey...here I am....Whats wrong with all this people that keep asking me about my old relationship? Why cant people get over it? What have I done or why do I deserve this? Im so frustrated with all of this story...Its been about 3 months that this is over and people come to talk to me about it all the time...Sometimes people will even judge me...whatever...I had my reasons and God knows that I did the right thing....What the hell....shit...this pisses me off so bad....It was a relationship between 2 people, not the whole san diego!!! So move on people,let me live.....Give me a fucking break....Im tired of this stupid-bastard people that come to me at the clubs judging me and looking weird at me....go live your own life and let me live..... I left because I was tired of being treated as a animal, as a stupid person, or someone invalid...I was tired of baby-sitting a well grown man that cant hold his own life...tired of being yelled all the time because I left a cup on the corner of the table or because I couldnt listen when something needed to be listen at a specific time.... I couldnt sleep, I didnt have money for anything, because I was always paying almost everything....I gave up of my own family to live this stupid relationship that went no where... I did what I had to do....but it seems that people dont understand, because they really dont know me well.or even dont know the person that they think that is his friend...and Im sorry..because all the people that come to me all the time and say this shit, I had NEVER trusted on them, because they are not nice people and they dont deserve my own respect...so go fuck all of you that bother me all the time....go live your life!!!!!! FUCK YOU ALL!!!!!

      Thanks Evan for a nice week and for making me feel loved again...I had one of the most amazing weeks of my life this past week..I met Evan, from Seattle, which was here for a week to visit his friends...Amazing...beautiful,unique...but seattle is so far away...Evan is thinking of moving here, but only in one year...I wont be able to handle this....but Im loving again... Oh god....when I left the airport, my world turned upside down..I cried the entire night..I couldnt sleep...Why did I like someone in this way but in a week of being together? I dont know..I think because he cared so much about me and I have never had someone that said so many nice and warming words to me... I feel empty..I feel lost..I feel that I met the love of my life and Im letting it go....but what should I do? This week really turned my head, my soul...I woke up today with a different view of life...Im sooo lost....please give me strengh God...somewhere..somwhow...I cant think, I cant breath, I feel like doing nothing at all....I have already searched for flights to seattle.... I love you....I do.... I miss you...more than anything!!!!

      its been more than a month and I dont have some things to say..Still the same thing..but the only new one is that Im not partying that much anymore...I think that this place is not worth of going out anymore..So small community, everyone knows everyone..it sucks...Im so bored..I know that all my blogs has been the same, always complaining about something..Sometimes I get happy but most of the time im getting bored..I met people and they are always not worth it...not worth of a time...what the hell is going on? Did I try, yes, I did....but it is not working..actually Im not looking for someone, but you know that sometimes you have this little hope....its weird,but we always have.... Maybe its time to focus myself as everybody say in my carreer....and forget about the rest...and I think that thats the perfect time for it...or maybe get  a second job in the morning ang forget about human beings..a clone, whatever.... time is passing and I dont see any changes in my life, only the fact that Im getting older and I keep tannig...working out??? never...but I have too...I have to take care of my body and soul, specially my abs... Its 10:55pm and I dont see any future anywhere....this bugs me so much!!! but anyway..... Lets see tomorrow...tomorrow is a new day

      Hellllloooooo...I know...I have been flaking for the past months, weeks, hours..Im so sorry.. I have been pretty busy at the hotel and I was kinda partying a lot too...Now finally I decided to stop and Im focusing on my career.. I have so many assignments and jobs that needs to be accomplished... and finally I have been having a break from the night life.. I went to on broadway lsast friday with my neighboors which it was a blast.. I havent been there for almost 1 year and a half... If I will go out, I will go to different places, not the same that I used to go before... Also I changed my hair..Oh god, finally...Now I have short hair, with low lights, highlights and red lights too...it looks pretty modern but it looks cool...Its just the fact that I have had long hair for the past months and now I have short hair..its weird but fun.... I deleted my account from the net ... I received so many stupid emails from this jerks that I decided to exclude myself from that...  Have plans to move also..I will probably be moving to N.Y pretty soon...Cant WAIT!!!!!! Og God, I hate this word..WAIT...but I will....Time is passing and my trip to Brazil is getting closer and closer...Cant wait for my brother's wedding...I dreamed about it last night..It will be awesome.. its been such a long time that I dont know what else to write down here...  Miss my family so much these past weeks... I will be fine though Marcello

      What's is love?What is devotion? What does happiness mean?Nothing is more frustrating than devoting yourself for something that you cant have or reach...Achieving sometimes sucks...Hurts...Does it heal? I don't know...Only time can tell...Looking for someone its not worth it...Waist of time...The good thing to do is to focus on yourself...Some heart is freezing....And I feel that I cant warm it up....There is no love..No passion...Maybe its the winter....But summer is around..  Notice me Take my hand Why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby
