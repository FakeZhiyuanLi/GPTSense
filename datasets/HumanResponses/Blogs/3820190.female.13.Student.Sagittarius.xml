      &nbsp; TESTS, TESTS AND MORE TESTS!!! The following week is FULL OF TESTS!! I had better push myself before I get "The RED Marks"!!  &nbsp; Tomorrow is our school's "X-Country".. I haven't had much running lately so I expected myself to give up halfway.. All I can do is have a good night's rest and drink sufficient water IN CASE I dehydrate!! &nbsp; There's also the upcoming a cappella performance that Mr Ong is going to perform in!! I forgotten to hand in the money to the SLs today.. I doubt I will meet them tomorrw but I'll still bring the money along.. If that's so, I'm going to bring a large amount of money with me tomorrow!! HEY!! Robber's out there!! See if you can rob me!! Haha.. &nbsp; I got to go now.. Byebye!!

        &nbsp; Ha!! I've finally found the time to surf the internet!! I was busy with school stuffs ( again !)&nbsp;recently..&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;Anyway, I'm now trying to get an account at   urlLink  www.runescape.com   .. It's a chat room where you can chat and "fight" at the same time!! There's another "chat-site" that I haven't been to for   ages  !! It's   urlLink  www.habbohotel.com   .. Another great (and ideal) website to go to make friends from   ALL AROUND THE WORLD  !!&nbsp;

        &nbsp; I am very sorry for not writing my blog recently!! I've been caught up with my school stuffs and therefore have not been writing it..   &nbsp; Many things&nbsp;had happened recently.. I really don't know why I keep on seeing "him" since this Monday!! I just saw "him" when I was at the bus-stop!! Luckily the bus came at that time or I would have not know what to say to "him"!! I guess Shurn  was  right when he said that I could still have some feelings for "him"..  &nbsp; There was this "Hand-over Ceremony" last Wednesday and since then the Choir had seemed smaller and more quiet than usual.. We learnt a new song, though..&nbsp;It's  You Raise Me Up,  played by Secret Garden and sung by Josh Groban. When I first heard this name(Josh). it reminded me of my old classmate, Joshua.. Wonder if I will see him again on Teachers' Day..  &nbsp; The swimming&nbsp;course started this Monday.. I&nbsp;HATE SWIMMING!!! Why can't the school&nbsp;be more affectionate and let me off?! And now i'll have to buy a new suit just because of that!!   BIG DEAL!!    &nbsp; I think that will be all.. Until next time!!

Guess I chosen the wrong day to write my blog...

        Yawn.. Still feeling sleepy after having a sleep last night.. Went with the Choir to watch the Musical held by Bedok North Secondary..  Guess what??  I saw the same director my Primary school had when our school was having our 50th Golden Anniversary!! It brings back bad memories when I saw him because he was so strict with the actors of the Musical that one of the actors cried when he went home!! I don't want to talk about him any more!!    Talk about today.. There's this Concert held by the Concert Band for Raising fund.. It was   superb  !! Good thing the items they had were different from last week's if not I would have fallen asleep!! Haiz.. The CrossCountry is approaching at the end of this month.. If Miss Poon called my register number just now, I would have been pardoned from the run!! If my friends that are chosen are pardoned from the run, I will push the blame to them if any thing bad were to happen to me!! Hehez.. Nah!! Just joking!!  I'm going to do my homework now..   Sayonara!!

        I reached home today at about 4.45pm, just before my mum and my brother came home!! I can't help but lie to my mum that I came home at 4.15.. Before I went home, I went to Westmall with one of my friend to eat lunch and borrow books from the library. Well.. It might sound like I'm a very good girl but I was actually walking around there to kill time!!    Talk about today.. It was really unlucky!! I was called   TWICE   by that "Gorilla" and I even promised her that I would be joining the "TalentTime" next year!! Then at Math lesson, Mrs Gan asked me to do a question that I didn't know how to do!! I had no choice but to borrow one of my friends book and write it on the white-board!! Then I took bus number 852 home. Yup!! You've guessed it right!! Another  BAD  event!! The bus driver drove so fast that I had to hold on to the railing infront of me even when I was seated!!      I'm certainly out of LUCK today!!

       Phew.. I've just made my FIRST blog!! Yipee!! Now I'm going to write it every Friday after noon!!  The first week of Term 3 is sure busy!! I had 1 subject teacher that had changed.. And that's my English teacher, Mdm Nuraidah!! And she is now replaced the HORRYFYING & HIDEOUS Miss "Gorilla" Chin!! Ah...! I don't know why but there's some kind of laughter potion in her that made the whole class laugh when she introduces herself the first time she came.. It made me laugh until my tears flowed out!!  I also had a new subject!! And it's Home Economics!! My Home E. teacher is Miss Michelle Chua and she's very kind to my group!!  I've gotta get out of the internet soon.. Byez!!
