      Sorry I haven't been writing much. I was in Chicago (yea, I got to go to Chicago!) last weekend, and I wasn't able to post anything.   A lot  has happened on my reality television shows, especially Big Brother 5. So, let me fill you in on everything that's happened so far.  Big Brother 5:  On the Thursday, July 22, episode of BB5, Lori was evicted from the Big Brother house in a 7-2 vote! Lori took her eviction well, probably because she had already won $10,000 already. It was sad to see Lori go, because she is such a sweetheart. Lori admitted that she felt that Jase was dominating the game, and I couldn't agree more. So, why did Lori get the boot so early in the game? First off, Lori immediately put a target on her back when she accepted $10,000 on the primeire episode of BB5. Though it's impossible for me to blame her for taking the money, she should have realized that even though some of her houseguests urged her to take the money, there were also going to be those who didn't agree with Lori taking the money. Marvin is a good example of one of those who didn't like the fact that Lori took $10,000, which left everyone to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a whole week. So, when Marvin won the HoH challenge the next week, he immediately put her up, stating that Lori will get more money than both the first and second runner-up... which is probably true. After Lori's eviction, the Head of Household challenge was held. Drew ended up winning it, and Jase appeared to be more happy about Drew winning the HoH challenge than even Drew was! On the Saturday, July 24, episode, Drew put both Jennifer (aka Nakomis) and Holly up for eviction. Jase and Scott were not happy about the fact that Drew put up one of their allies (Holly) up for eviction, and they managed to make Drew feel bad about it. On the Tuesday, July 27, episode, we find out that Jase is a huge fan of Brad Pitt. Nakomis won the Power of Veto and she took herself off the nomination block! I was happy that Nakomis won the PoV, but I was mad to see Drew put Adria up for eviction. Remember, Adria has a identical twin sister named Natalie and if they make it to week #5 (next week!) without the other houseguests realizing two different individuals are playing Adria, they both get to come into the game and compete for the $500,000! I wish them all the luck in the world! That brings me to yesterday's episode. In a 7-1 vote, Holly was evicted from the Big Brother House. I'm assuming that Jase is the only person who voted to keep Holly in the house, while the rest of his alliance (Scott and Michael) and everyone else voted to evict Holly. After being evicted, Holly talked to Julie Chen and told her that Diane was jealous of her. In Diane's good-bye message to Holly, she openly stated that Holly's eviction is "good riddance". I couldn't agree more. Holly wasn't a bad person, she was just in that "four horsemen" alliance, and you all know how I feel about that alliance. So, why did Holly lose? Even though Holly probably didn't mean to, she did cause a lot of conflict in the house. Holly annoyed other houseguests. Holly was seen as a threat. Holly had the power to tug on Jase's heartstrings, which worried Jase's other allies, Michael, Scott, and Drew. Holly caused conflict between Jase and Scott, which was why Drew put Holly up for eviction in the first place. Plus, Jase angered Marvin when he, Jase, won the PoV and took Holly off the nomination block the week before. Plus, Adria was really well-liked by everyone. The new HoH has not been declared, but we'll find out on tomorrow's episode, which will air at 8:00 c/t.  Last Comic Standing: In the Wild Card episode, the five eliminated comics (Bonnie, Todd, Ant, and Jay) all got to perform their acts in front of America in hopes of being voted back into the game. Jay won America's vote, and he got to join the five remaining comics (Kathleen, Gary, Tammy, Alonzo, and John). Jay has another chance to become the Last Comic Standing!

      Hi!&nbsp; I might be going to Chicago tomorrow with my mom!&nbsp; I've only been to Illinois once in my life,&nbsp;and that was for an hour in September, 2001.&nbsp; My mom wants to go down to Illinois to see my aunt, and I might be able to go too.&nbsp; I asked my boss if I can take off work on Sunday so that I can go down with her.&nbsp; He told me that he'll get back to me because he has to find someone to work for me.&nbsp; I'm crossing my fingers, hoping that I can get that day off.&nbsp; If I do get the day off, we're heading down tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope I can get my neighbor, who's also watching Big Brother 5, to tape it when it airs on Thursday and Saturday.  Last night, I saw a commercial while I was watching Last Comic Standing, and it reported that the second season of NBC's "The Apprentice" will begin airing on Thursday, September 9!&nbsp; I didn't get to watch the first season (well, I did get to see the premiere episode), but my cousin says that it was awesome.&nbsp; His favorite contestant was Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth!&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'm going to be watching it because it's probably going to be on while CBS's "Survivor: Vanuatu" is on.&nbsp; Reality TV World has announced that the new season of Survivor will begin airing on Thursday, September 16, at 7:00 c/t.&nbsp; Interestingly, the site also names some of the contestants.&nbsp; If you want to check it out,  urlLink click&nbsp;here .  Anyways, it's time to fill you in on what happened on Last Comic Standing and Big Brother 5.  Big Brother 5: Lori, Will, and Karen plotted to have Holly evicted.&nbsp; However, Jase won the Power of Veto (PoV) and he used it to take Holly off the nominee list, forcing Marvin (who is Head of Household) to choose another person to put up for eviction.&nbsp; Marvin decided to put up Lori's best friend Karen up for eviction.&nbsp; It's obvious that either Lori - who's currently up for eviction - or Karen will be evicted on the Thursday, July 22, episode.&nbsp; I predict that Lori will get evicted because she already won $10,000.&nbsp; Scott and Diane are becoming fast enemies.&nbsp; Scott insulted Diane in yesterday's episode, making her cry.&nbsp; I hope he gets evicted soon.  Last Comic Standing: Kathleen Madigan, Gary Gulman, Tammy Pescatelli, Alonzo Bodden, and John Heffron have all made it into the final five!&nbsp; Tammy won immunity, reserving a spot for herself there.&nbsp; The eliminated comics (Bonnie McFarlane, Todd Glass, Ant, and Jay London) all voted with the current comics for whom they wanted to see do a Head-to-Head (H2H) match.&nbsp; John and Corey Holcomb had to do the H2H match.&nbsp; But, there was a twist: the H2H match was actually going to be a H2H2H match!&nbsp; Meaning that another remaining comic had to go H2H with both John and Corey, also facing a possible elimination.&nbsp; The comics all voted again, and Alonzo had the most votes.&nbsp; John, Corey, and Alonzo all did their acts in front of the audience, and Alonzo garnered 55% of the votes.&nbsp; John got 38% of the votes from the audience, leaving Corey with the remaining 7%.&nbsp; Corey was eliminated from the contest.&nbsp; Now, the show's format seems to be similar to that of American Idol's.&nbsp; The comics have to perform their acts to America (maybe even LIVE), and WE get to vote for whom we like best.&nbsp; We watch the comics perform their acts and vote for whom we liked best on Tuesdays at 7:00 c/t, and the winners will be revealed on Thursdays at 8:00 c/t.&nbsp; LCS's Wild Card Show will air at 8:00 c/t on Tuesday, July 27.

       I didn't post anything on Friday (July 16th) because I didn't have time.&nbsp; I was at a friend's house, and we went swimming.&nbsp; Then, we went to another friend's house and stayed there.&nbsp; I ended up getting a stuffy nose.&nbsp; It was very hot out, so that's why we went swimming in the first place.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; On Saturday, I had to go out to our farm to hay.&nbsp; I didn't feel very well, so I didn't have to hay that much.&nbsp; I had to work on Sunday, and it was super-busy.&nbsp; We had 322 come in to eat, and it wasn't even a holiday (which are usually very busy)!&nbsp; My friend's birthday was yesterday, and she had a party with her friends and family.&nbsp; She turned 21 yesterday!&nbsp; They had really good food there.&nbsp; They cooked hamburgers on the grill (yum!).&nbsp; She has a lot of kittys at her house, and she gave me one!&nbsp; The kitty that she gave me is yellow, and his name is Lucky.&nbsp; I'm going to take him out to the farm to live.    &nbsp;  Big Brother 5:   Anyways, this was a big week for Big Brother 5!&nbsp; On Saturday, when I got back from the farm, I thought that I missed BB5!&nbsp; But, I didn't!&nbsp; However, I thought I did and I forgot that it was actually on at 8:00 on Saturdays.&nbsp; So, at 8:00, I was going through channels to see what was on, and BB5 was on!&nbsp; Luckily, I didn't miss the nomination ceremony.&nbsp; On the Thursday, July 15, episode, Mike was evicted.&nbsp; So, why was he the first to be evicted?&nbsp; It could be this.&nbsp; Mike was probably&nbsp;the first houseguest to realize that Jase and Scott were huge threats in the household.&nbsp; Jase and Scott's alliance is practically controlling the household.&nbsp; Mike attempted to convince people to go after them, despite the fact that Jase and Scott WEREN'T on the chopping block... Mike himself was.&nbsp; I believe Mike actually convinced the household to be threatened by the Jase/Scott alliance, and the other houseguests probably believed that if they didn't vote Jase and Scott's way (which was to vote Mike out), they would be targeted by Jase and Scott to be the next evicted.&nbsp; This was probably Mike's downfall.&nbsp; After Mike's eviction, Marvin won Head of Household.    &nbsp;  On Saturday's show, Jase and Scott talked with Marvin about who he should put up for eviction.&nbsp; They all agreed to put Lori up for eviction, since she decided to accept the $10,000 offered by the show in exchange for everyone living off peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for a week.&nbsp; They had originally planned to put Lori's best friend Karen up too, but Marvin decided to put Holly up with Lori instead.&nbsp; Marvin believed that Lori and Holly were the strongest players in the house.    &nbsp;  It turns up that Adria does have a twin sister named Natalie.&nbsp; If they make it through half the game without the other houseguests catching on that they are two separate people playing the same person, they both get a chance to compete for the $500,000.&nbsp; The Power of Veto ceremony will be held on the Tuesday, July 20, episode of BB5.

      Big Brother 5:  Jase and Scott managed to keep Jennifer and Mike up for eviction, so the Power of Veto didn't save them. Scott, who earned the right to use the Power of Veto, didn't use it. The women formed a all-female alliance, and the four horsemen found out thanks to Will. *POSSIBLE SPOILER*.........................So, who is the twin? According to my cousin, Adria has a twin named Natalie, and they're playing as one player in the Big Brother House.   Last Comic Standing:  Once again, Gary Gulman had to go head to head with another comic. However, he came out a winner... again! Gary defeated Jay London in the head to head match, once again proving that he deserved to be in the final five. The show seems a lot more exciting now that Ant was defeated. Everyone seems to be voting for whom they truly believe they are more funnier than. The problem I had with Ant is that he wanted people to vote in an alliance, and that's truly a bore. The comics had to perform in front of children. Kathleen Madigan won immunity, performing as a leperchaun. And the remaining comics got a new dog named Rusty! Kathleen took an instant liking to Rusty. The remaining comics were giving Rusty cold pizza and other foods a dog might enjoy. John complained that the dog is getting fed better than he himself is.   Anyways, next week, the eliminated contestants come back to haunt the remaining contestants! The returnees include: Bonnie McFarlane, Todd Glass, Ant, and, of course, Jay London. Do they want sweet revenge, or do they just want to make things MORE difficult for the remaining comidiennes? I wonder...   Anyways, I'll write more on Friday... the day after the first eviction on BB5.

      Well, it turns up that I got my TV on Saturday rather than Friday.  But, hey, I have a VCR now!  So I can tape Last Comic Standing while Big Brother 5 is on.  I got "The Family Guy" series on DVD for $44.  I haven't had much time to watch it though.  LCS and BB5 are going to be on tomorrow.  Last Comic Standing airs from 7-9 c/t and Big Brother is on from 8-9 c/t for anyone interested in watching them.  There's not much to say now, but I'm sure I'll be more talkative on Wednesday... the day after I see the shows!  I just got done working.  We only had 70-some people who ate at the restaurant today, so it was really slow.  The restaurant I work at usually serves at least 100-150 people daily!  Of course, it's a Monday and Mondays can be slow sometimes.  Probably because we close at 1:00 on Mondays when we normally stay open until 2:00 on other days.  It's closed all day on Tuesday.  I usually work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Sundays.  This week, I'm working Thursday too.  Well, talk to you all later.

      Hi!  My name is Dan, and I'm new at this.  Anyways, I'm a reality tv junkie (thanks, Brian).  I like to watch the  urlLink Last Comic Standing  and  urlLink Big Brother 5 .  Unfortunately, they both air on Tuesdays at the same time.  Today, my sister is taking me to Winona to get a new VCR.  Then I can tape Last Comic Standing while Big Brother's on.   Big Brother 5 :   On the premiere eppy of BB5, Jase won HoH ("Head of Household").  Jase bugs me because he and Scott believe that they're in control of everything in the Big Brother house.  Maybe that's true, but I believe someone in the house is going to win HoH and put both of them up for eviction at the same time, assuring that one of them will be evicted.  On yesterday'ss episode, Jase decided to put Mike and Jennifer (aka Nicomus) up for eviction.  I hope that Mike goes home because Nicomus rocks.  By the way, Nicomus is the half-sister of Michael.  So, I hope Michael prevents Nicomus from getting the boot.   Last Comic Standing :   vs.   Last Tuesday, Ant (left) lost the head to head match to Gary Gulman.  I'm glad of that because Ant seemed manipulative.  To tell the truth, I was shocked because I thought Ant was funnier than Gary.  However, the audience said differently.  Next Tuesday, the comics have to perform their act in front of one tough crowd... kids!  This might be tough for some comics, but I hope Tammy does fine.  Tammy is my favorite comic because she won against Todd Glass in the head-to-head match, effectively sending him home!  So, those are the two main shows I'm watching.  See ya.
