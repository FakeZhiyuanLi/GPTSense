      I'm thinking i like Livejournals better. Seeing how the blog thing faded out i thought i would get a blog. Richard and i are the only ones right now, that i know of, that have a livejournal, so its just like letters back and froth. I'm kind of tired so i will post about something that is on my mind. TTFN

         So i'm standing there, just got out of the shower and i'm listening to a song, saying how many times we look at the cross and forget what our life cost was. And it hit me. my God died for me... Yep thats right Cassy, he didn't want to be with out you any longer, so he STAYED on the cross for ya. And to tell you the truth, it pissed me off. You wouldn't think that it would but it did. I have a screen saver that says he died for me, i live for him. And what a bunch of crap that is. There are sins in my life that i feel like i can't let go off. That i know i haven't done yet, but i think about them, so that is doing... So i have done it... How in the world is that living for him? I'm choosing a sin over my God... And i haven't even done the stupid sin yet! Its kind of like your going to steal a bike. so you plan on it. Plan the times and the places and stuff. Thats sinning. In Gods eyes you basically did it! But people dont know that i'm thinking about stealing a bike... So people think that i'm doing good. And being a good person. How sad? Now let me clear up some things: I'm not planning on stealing a bike, and i am a person that wishes to follow God... And i can't use the "well i'm human, i'm not perfect" Excuse. Cause thats not it at all! I can run. I can run like the wind from this sin. I've done it before. But i decide not to. How is that wanting to follow after God? Good question. Maybe i'm just fooling myself in thinking that i acutally want to have a heart that desires my God... Kind of funny how someones mind works huh? Or someones desires over the right way... Well i have had the house to myself latly. Its clean. Nice to come home to a clean house? You know it! Now that i have nothing to do, my mind wonders. And at times i let it go out so far that i can't stop it. Which i hate the way my mind works. Sometimes i wish i wouldn't be able to think. But i do that alot. you know how you can read something, and your like what? What did i just read? That happens all the time... What a bummer. I think its a bummer cause i do it when i'm reading Gods letter... How sad... I spent a week on my one verse, and it still is mind boogling. I like it though. I keep calling Richard but no one is answering.

      I just now... was sitting here praying and sing and doing all that good stuff I like to do... And I realized something... I'm holding back.. I'm scared. I didn't want to worship fully... Why? Cause I’m scared of my God... Yes, I should be, I mean look at all he has done, look at what he does, think about what he is going to do... Am I so scared of actually experiencing Him. to the fullest... I know I can't handle it all. I did have a taste of it, and to tell you the truth I don’t know if I want it again... I'm scared of just diving right in and experiencing my God the way he wants me to. I feel comfortable with how I am right now... Close, but not to close... I'm comfortable... What a horrible thing to say... I'm satisfied... WHY? Maybe cause that’s what I want.. I want to be done. I want to stop having to grow maybe. But yet the right Christian response would have to be, I do want to grow... more and more, I want to experience God to the fullest. Well... I can't say that. I mean I can say anything, but my heart doesn't want it. Why? Why doesn't Cassy want to experience God even more then what she does now? Cause she’s scared... And she’s comfortable with it right now... What happens if I do see God? (I don’t mean like in a person, but whatever God does, he does) I would have nothing to say... Thank you doesn't add up, I’m sorry doesn't mean anything. So I just stand there. Some would say in awe... Which yes, what can I say? I would say looking stupid in front of a cute boy you really like... Or I run? That just came to mind. I run from God... I start thinking about something else, I start talking to someone else... I do something else. I did it with this... I am putting a post on here. Trying to avoid experiencing something bigger and better then I am. And I’m scared to stop typing and start praying. Cause now I know that my God wants me closer. So if I don’t get closer, I don’t get closer. And that is killer... Is anyone really scared about experiencing God fully... I know its a stupid question, but I know I always say how fun, and awesome and wow it will be. But really. But is it real? Is it truly God that is showing himself to me… I don’t think so. Why would he? I have heard and read tons of stories about men that feared the Lord and he was friends with them (FRIENDS!!!) So yea duh he showed himself to them… but me? Am I a friend of God? Or just one of the worshipping people… Walking around mindless saying Jesus loves you… He is choosing to have a friendship with me… Am I choosing the same? I am a horrible friend, so I don’t think I could have a friendship… Its sooooo hard!  By the way... I am listening to "the wonderful cross" and all i can think about is... WHATS SO FREAKIN WONDERFUL ABOUT IT? My God was killed on that darn thing... Why should i say thats great, thats wonderful... I wasn't forgiven cause of the cross... I was forgive cause my God died... Well really his son, but HE DIED... The cross didn't do anything! I see it as if Jesus was shoot with a gun, we would all have a gun on our alters... Right? Now dont get me wrong, i dont think there is anything wrong with wearing a cross... Or having a cross. But you need to know what it means, i mean come on! I see tons of people wearing the dran thing and act like My God, the person that went on those pieces of wood for that person, hasn't changed there life... How sad! I think its beautiful to see someone wear it, it makes me happy to think "wow they are saying something" But is someones life really refecting that? I would like to hope so. Sorry getting off my thing... But i dont see why i should say that those piece of wood that hurt him soooo badly is sooo wonderful...The same with Wipes, and Nails... I should get a little tome thingy, you know to show that he didn't just die, but he came right back up! Where can i get one?

      Kind of sucks to think that you lost your best friend... huh? Well i think i just did... I lost him to a girl. Which to tell yal' the truth, i'm not to upset about it. Yea it sucks, yea it hurts. But this girl is nice. And i like her. It just sucks that once this other person comes online, lets say, and my best friend is talking to me, he stops. Get it? Well i do. And it sucks...

      Did i work the hardest i could? Seeing how much i'm in pain, i think i really did work my butt off. No huge changes happends, no one got saved and fell to the ground crying cause some kids were cleaning... But it was a blessing... I liked "kickin" in with "homies".My mind was on alot of things today, mostly sleep and how much i wanted to be in my bed. But also a boy... :0... I think i'm meant to live a life with out dating... No men, no boys, no anything like that. I always feel like i'm putting God last. Or i shouldn't be dating cause i love my God... But thats not it... Right?i can't ask people what they think cause they will say "Do what you feel is right"... What i feel is right?! Well i'm feeling to different things... Kind of sucks... yea...

      I dont know why... I know that God and i have seen better days. But i'm not to bummed. I know my God is right here with me. Weither i say howdy or not. He is still here. Wow... He doesn't go away. I mean wow. Even when i have harded my heart and have my pride in the way, he is still reaching out for me. And for a split second, when i forget about my sin. And just look to him. I see the truth. Wow... I showed my brother how to play poker. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. My friends are going through a hard time. My Best friend doesn't know what is going on. All i know is that i know what he is feeling like. And then a good friend, Kyle, isn't doing to good either...Whats going on?  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. (1 John 4:1 KJV)- i just read this online and i thought it would be nice to put it on here. God is truly awesome. The prayer ministier i can't wait to start. Who can? I'm scared, seeing how my expectation are high, seeing how i know God will bless it. But what if it isn't my will... What if i shoudln't be doing this? What if it hurts more then blesses? So much to worry about that i shouldn't even be thinking about... Its in Gods hands... Trust in the lord with all you do, and he will totally bless it... Its somewhere in the bible, i dont think it says totally tho...

      I hate the way i am sometimes... No not sometimes, all the time. I hate the way i think. And what i do. Or dont do. What i say. They way i act. It is a true pooh. And if someone else was saying this to me, i would tell them... "well change..." Now see with me, i can. I'm sure i can. but do i really want to? I mean is it going to make me happy? I'm sure it would make others happyier. And for the things i am thinking about right now, i'm sure it would really make others happier. But would i be happy? Now that is a hard question to answer. I am Joyful. I am full of joy, dont get me wrong. But...I dont know. I'm trunning out like my parents. But i think thats cause i spend so much time with them (My Dad) And i dont want to be like them, (My Mom) I would give anything not to be like my mom... So she is awesomely caring person. But just some of the stuff mannnnnnnn. I dont know.

      So we were driving home and my dad said there should be a Jesus game... You know where your Jesus, and you have to do all the things Jesus did. And you get temtaions and stuff. So i thought that was cute. And a thought came to mind, about my past. It has nothing to do with the Jesus game or anything. But we were talking about dogs and cats fighting. And a picture of me when i was like 8,crawed up on the floor out side in grass. And having my Dog at the time being chased by some wild dog. I was out side and heard this barking, and then a dog coming my way. My dog would never hurt me. But that other one, when i was on the ground came up and smelled me. I got sooo scared. But it ran away. I dont remeber after that. But yal want another memior... something that came to mind... Well i have never been kissed, and this was in 7th grade. (Duh.. Cassy not kiss yet... i wish...)But anywyas. I was dating this guy, well really not dating, we never talked, never hanged out. Nothing. But then he started hanging out with this other girl. And i or he, i dont know, said it was over. But a while after that, i dont remeber how long, he started flirting wth me again. So he walked me home and when we were half way down the hill his lips and touge some how found a way to my mouth... What the heck? It was on the side of the freakin street! And i tripped... I didn't fall. But i did feel my foot get stuck. How horrible. And... I bumped my teeth on his... So when we stopped, he went in for the kill again, and i didn't even try. My friends saw him walking down the street smiling and high-fiving all the guys. Nothing happend after that. Then at 12 i think, my friends and i were liking hanging out with 16-17 year old guys, and we ended up in one of there rooms. And this guy named Jessie and i started to kiss. Nothing long or anything. But then afterward, he pulled me closer to him, and just held me... I was like what is going on? There is nothing goin on here. We are just friends, why are holding me. I was kind of freaked out. Dont rember what happend after that. So yea... That it for right now. I can go on with memiors...

      So I'm sitting around. Not really doing much. Who can hang out? Do i really want to hang out? I dont want to stay in side thats for sure. So what can i do? Who can do stuff with? What to do? I have cleaned every part of the house, nothing left. So what do i do now? go over to my best friends... Dont want to stay inside. What to do! I am really boreing person to tell the truth, its not like yal' didn't know that in the first place. Shannon called me to talk for a while. And i kind of didn't say anything. I didn't talk. I couldn't. I had no clue what to talk about... The same with Katie. once say what needs to be said, we are done. man i suck at friendships. My sister and i can say or do whatever, its fine. But out side my family. What to do about this?  i have another thing on my mind. Theres a boy. There always is... This boy and I have a weird relationship. And if it was anyone else but me in this relationship, like another girl. They would forget this boy and never think about him again. But as for me. I dont know what it is... Is it cause there is no one else around... no, thats not it. Cause every single time, even when there is another in my life, i drop everything for this guy.But now he isn't talking to me. Duh, thats cause he doesn't want to be with you Cassy... I'm not stupid, i know these things. But why can i let it go till he tells me...This is sooo upseting.

      Friends is a huge thing in anyones life... Right? I know they are in mine. Even when i dont have many, i know they are imporant... I mean everyone has to have atleast one friend right? Well I was sitting up last night and was wanting to talk to someone... anyone... So i started talking to katie... Pretty funny convo. We had a good time. But how many friends have a lost along the way. Planty. i can count alot of them. And the thing is i can't get them back. There are three main people that i'm thinking of. And its kind of sad. Cause they are all my fault. I stopped talking to them. I was upset at them. Something like that. Its pretty sad huh? So can i work on the relationships... i dont think so. Well i dont know what to do  for the prayer minstiy. I have been praying two of the same prayers. One for someone who wants to us to pray for them, and then for his will to be done. I dont think i should be doing ministiry. its not that i dont love doing. I love doing that kind of stuff. but everything i do, God doesn't seem to belss through me, but through others... Which i love watching. But still its upseting, to want to do something for God. Yet i dont know what to do. And there is so much other stuff going on with this youth ministiry, i dont know how to ask for help... O what to do...

      I am hungry... Now i do mean it by eating food. But also for money. Kind of sad? Well i went shopping and i think i stayed under 100 $... I wish i got more... Kind of sad? Thats the thought that came through my mind. that in two months i'm going to go shopping again... And i am sick of it. I love clothing. Who doesn't? But i dont want to put my imporantance on it... I have a question... I love praying with people. But its different when i am praying and singing, and listening with people... When  its just by myself. Is that right? or not? Just wondering.. Cause i love praying with people. But now that i'm not. My prayer life is going down. Thats what it seems like to me... I dont like that

      We Sing Alleluia  by Ffh   There's an anthem ringing out You can hear it clear and loud Coming from the hearts of men Echoing the Great I Am  And it goes on and on and on and never fades away On and on and on and so we join today  We sing alleluia Praise Your name and glorify We sing alleluia Lift our voices to the sky  There's a song that never dies It lives within the heart that cries Out for mercy on the streets It's a cry of love and harmony  And it goes on and on and on and never fades away On and on and on and so we join today  Men have praised You Through the ages Followers who have gone before us So we stand before You And we lift our voices All together we join the chorus  A song that never ends... Could i sing of his love forever? Every time we sing that... i ask myself that... Kind of weird...

      Now i was just talking to a good friend of mine. I have never met this person in my life. and i'm thinking i will never meet him. Seeing how he lives in Texas... But this man makes me stand in awe... There are only two people in my life, that are males, that i see them truly wanting God... Richard.. And Kyle. The difference between them is, Kyle... Just Kyle. Rick has a passion for God. And i see that with my eyes. But Kyle. I talk to him every now and then. And this man also has a passion. thats what i want. I have been having a hard time with thinking that i am ever going to get what i want. Which is a Godly man. And i really want that. Right now... But maybe why i dont have that. Is cause i'm not a Godly woman.  And Kyle, me dear. You are the reasoning for my thinking. I'm not saying that i want to date these two young men. but i am saying this is what i want. but i can't be that for them. I'm not ready... Thats why. Now i'm thinking Satan is pushing others in the way. That can be Godly. but doesn't have the passion... And i hate saying Godly. Seeking God... Thats it. These two men are trying to find God... And to tell you the truth. That is a beautiful thing. Am i being beautiful? am i seeking the one who has been seeking me? Are others looking at me saying "that is a young lady seeking God"? If not, why not? Cause i'm not living like it. That is sooo it! I'm not Seeking God... What i have wanted for so long, is a Godly man... but the truth is i need to be a Godly woman. Kyle thank you. To marry a man that is truely seeking God with his heart and his life. Is something i want. And something i'm going to wait for. And perpare for...

      Well i'm not sure if someone is mad at me. But i know last week I said I would help out with some stuff. And it turns out I didn't make it. But I didn't have a ride. So I couldn't make it. So now I feel bad. And why shouldn't she be mad? I shouldn't have signed up if I didn't know about rides. Man I feel horrible... She didn't even talk to me this morning...  What am I going to do?  Something that has been on my mind lately is college... And I have my eyes on CCU... Which is  kind of funny. Cause I don't want to be a consoler, but that's what this school dose. I don't know. We will see what else pops up...

      So i'm standing there taking a shower. And the thought comes to mind. I dont really have to worship God... Now i'm sure some of you are thinking "Its Satan!!!!" And i dont know, it just might be. but i am thinking a different way. Where in the bible does it say your safed if you go to church every Sunday, and help out 3 times a week. and you read your bible 4 times a week. And you "pray" 2 a week. And you go to a bible study once a month... NO WHERE... James Chapter 2 says:  8Yes indeed, it is good when you truly obey our Lord's royal command found in the Scriptures: "Love your neighbor as yourself."[3] 9But if you pay special attention to the rich, you are committing a sin, for you are guilty of breaking that law. (NLT)  Now it says it is awesome. It is wonderful. But you still are saved even if you dont do all of Gods laws. Now i know that there is soooo much to go along with this. So much, i dont really want to sit here and type it all, (And it doesn't help i really want to go to sleep) But i was thinking about a song also... "Seeking you face and not only your hands" It took me a while to understand what the world the guy was saying. But i got it. His has helped save us. And so many are into the "I'm saved, lets go on our way" thing, and not looking for the face of Christ. Are they still saved? Heck yea they are! Does it upset you that you dont get to drink, have sex till your married, cruss, act out of angry, be jelouse, gossip, and so much more. And someone else does, but they are still going to go to heaven if they believe in there heart in this one thing? I know it upseted me like anything. Sadly i think i was told a lie. "When you get to heaven you get a crown. And the brighter the crown is, the better faith or whatever you had while you were here" Now if i was told this, i would throw up. That makes me sick to think that... Where in the bible does it say that? Can someone tell me please! At the time, when i was told this, i was happy. I was like good. I'm going to get a big yellow one, and its going to have dimions and hearts and everything on it... Now... i dont want a freakin crown. I shouldn't be just worshipping my God with my life, cause of the life afterwards... What would happen if there were no heaven? Would you still worship him? Would you still go after him with all your heart? Would you give him all your life, and all you have? Even when you knew there was no reward? Other then being with him... Would that be a big eoungh reward for you and me? I know its a lot of questions. And i know how i would like to answer. But i dont know what the truth is. Should we be worshipping like there is no after-life?

      Well i was sitting in drivers ED all day. I loved it. I really wanted to get out there and die.. i mean drive... lol. It was kind of scary. All the stuff. Cause i have alread gotten into an crash. Not a big one. But it still stinks... I'm just scared. My mom has distoryed more then one car. And i dont want to do the same. But i really want to drive cause it would help alot with things. But i got to thinking about Worship. And how people think that the only time we worship God is at church. How did they come up with that conculesen? From others around them only doing that? I'm not sure. But how? I was thinking about the church saying it. I dont know if thats true. All i know is that thats the way i was thinking. About 3, 2 years ago. And something else that came to mind, and has been for a while. And my life. I always think when i'm praying "Wow i am doing a great thing, God is happy!" Or reading my bible. But thats not true. I'm sure God delights in it. but the truth is there are time i chose to not pray. Or read. Its funny i could think wow i'm being a great christian. But maybe to someone else, i'm really far from it. And even comparied to God. And how Jesus was, i'm not that great... Stupid Pride!

      I'm tired. My back hurts really bad. My legs hurt. My head hurts. I'm scared about my future. I dont know what to do. Where can i find rest? I dont know. Healing? I dont know. Everything is so not for sure. My God is the only one that can keep up walking on the water. I keep looking at everything else but him. I'm going to drained if i dont keep my fouse... Looking foward to the prize ahead of me. This life means nothing. Then why do i hold it so closely if it means nothing! I'm not going through a hard time with God yal'. Him and i are fine. I just feel really un-worthy right now. I am seeing my prayers answered.... Wanting to see my sins. And now that i see so many of them, i am being saded, at how blind i have been. I think i am going to call Kyle...

      Where are they? Well to tell yal the truth they are on a boy... I know! How stupid! I hate it. Not cause of which boy, and not cause its un-pure thoughts. but thats not what my life is about. I'm not living for a boy. I'm living for God... Yet my thoughts aren't on that. Well, unless you count having a "godly" relationship with this young man. Which i have been thinking about.... But i called him last night. It took me an hour to get the nerve up to call him. But did... And he was happy to hear from me. I was sooo on nerves that i didn't know what to talk about. so i let him do all the talking. Which was wonderful, i loved listening to him. but why are my thoughts on that? Every time i have a free moment to myself, i think about seeing him. Or going out and doing something with him. On a date... And so on.... Its not the fact that i hate it. i dont mind thinking about this young man. But is it wrong? Its not unpure. Man i should limit the thoughts times down. But its hard. I like thinking about him. I love talking to him. He is the reason i get on now-a-days. And if we dont talk, i feel bummed out. This is what you call a crush, right? But it didn't start out that way. I just loved talking to him cause we both had the same insights on a few things. Cause he was a God seeking man, and i was a God fearing woman. But now its different. Before, i could handle not talking to him. I didn't wait everyday just to talk to him. but now i do.... He is still God seeking, fearing, loving, and sooo much more. And i am still God fearing. I guess i think its so silly cause its so out of reach. And i mean really... Its out of reach. But i want to have faith. That if its in Gods blue prints for my life, then it will happen. I really do hope it is though... I really really REALLY want that person to be in the blue prints...

      A thought just came to mind. When i used to sing with our praise team, i loved. I love having a Mic. in my hand, and being the center of attion. At the time i could care less if people were truly singing to God. I liked looking at people and seeing them looking at me... Which i know they weren't. But its was a mind of a little child. But have i really changed? I remember i was trying to match up my voice with someone elses and i did. With out knowing. And the person that was listening to us. Said "Cassy you got it, good job!" Then guess what? I totally i mean totally messed it up. And the girl i was trying to match it with said "I hate it every time someone says good job to me, cause then i get nervse and mess up." So i know she heard me. Its funny, how i wanted to be heard when i was doing a great job, but right what i messed up, the first thought that came to mind was i hope no one heard that.  So i dont have any deep thoughts tonight, i never think i do. The truth is, this is all the stuff i think about during the day. Today i thought about death alot. Kind of sad. I have only known of one person in my life dying. And i wasn't really close to him.t not any more... Not for now that is. But anyways back on topic... My mind wasn't worshipping... And where my mind is, soon will be my heart and body. And pride came to mind. The thoughts that were coming to my mind were all about me. And how i can be lifed up. How i can be praised. And saying this, and knowing that people are going to read it, kind of make me want to cry. I want people to think i am a good person. And i want to go after God with not only my life, but also my mind, heart, soul and strenght. And this is showing all for you that i am not perfect. Which i would hope that yal' know i'm not perfect. But i hate saying what i'm not good at. *lost trail of thought*  o... but i was thinking about myself. And not God... I was singing a praise song of how i should put less of me and more of Him and everything, and look at where my mind is? ALL ON ME! Kind of stupid huh? The mindless worshipping zonbie here. "Jesus loves me...Jesus died...Jesus, Jesus..." Sorry i got a picutre in my mind... but i had to much pride. So i stopped. I stopped acting like i was giving myself in worship and praise and just said man i'm sorry. And i'm not saying this to be praised... I know thats what i would be thinking if i read this in someone elses. but i did. I was like man, i am making something that you have given me, a gift. And i am not praising you for it, or with it, i am praising myself with it. Thinking that i should be praised. what a stupid thought! What a child like thought... What a Cassy thought. it makes me sick!     But getting off of the beating my self up train.  I have a new out look... I know what i want! Thats right. There isn't a young man in my reach, yes. but i know i can find a man that is God seeking and God fearing. And now that i know what i want. Everything else and Everyone else seems so worthless... Not worthless, thats mean, but not worth my time chaseing after. The yonung man i wrote about before, saying how i always went back to him, seem worthless now. Now even someone i am looking at. i dont care.

IsnÂt that crazy  I have not been called to the wisdom of this world.. But to a God who's calling out to me.. And even though the world may think  I'm losing touch with reality It would be crazy  To choose this world over eternity  And if I boast let me boast Of filthy rags made clean And if I glory let me glory In my Savior's suffering IsnÂt that crazy  And as I live this daily life I trust you for everything And I will only take a step When I feel You leading me IsnÂt that crazy  I have not been called to the wisdom of this world.. But to a God who is calling out to me.. And even though the world my think  I'm losing touch with reality It would be crazy  To choose this world over eternity  Call me crazy  You can call me crazy Call me crazy  I have not been called to the wisdom of this world..

      Provbers 31: 10Who can find a virtuous and capable wife? She is worth more than precious rubies. 11Her husband can trust her, and she will greatly enrich his life. 12She will not hinder him but help him all her life.20She extends a helping hand to the poor and opens her arms to the needy. 23Her husband is well known, for he sits in the council meeting with the other civic leaders. 27She carefully watches all that goes on in her household and does not have to bear the consequences of laziness. 28Her children stand and bless her. Her husband praises her: 29"There are many virtuous and capable women in the world, but you surpass them all!" 30Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the LORD will be greatly praised. 31Reward her for all she has done. Let her deeds publicly declare her praise. 1 Timothy 2: 10For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do. 11Women should listen and learn quietly and submissively. 12I do not let women teach men or have authority over them. Let them listen quietly. 13For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve. 14And it was the woman, not Adam, who was deceived by Satan, and sin was the result. 15But women will be saved through childbearing[1] and by continuing to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty. Ok So i was sitting down last night before i went to sleep, for about 2 hours, but anyways. And the thought came to me... I'm a woman... (MAn, i feel like a woman!) So yea. i'm sure yal' are thinking, Cassy you just now found that out! I have known that forever. But i looked at it from God point of seeing. And this was all that i found, the verses. And the thought that came to my mind at frist was, wow. Thats alot. Am i really doing all this? Will i be able to? Is t really hard? Well that last question is a no brain... heck yea its hard.But at the same time, if i'm right with god, and wanting him more and more, is it really hard to do that? so yea. Thats just what went through my mind. I want to be a women of God. I want to lift up my God. Now another thing, i was listening to some radio thingy, and a women was talking about something. but it was just gossip. And it was something about a women and the guy was saying soemthing in the effect of women not doing some stuff...That men can do. Now my thinking on it is, i can do anything a man can do. But Thats not the way God made me, i'm thinking. I will, and i hope i do now, put myself under any one. But also under any man. Whatever my dad says, goes. Can tell him what i think, but thats it. As for my husband to be. What he says goes, i will tell him what i think. And something Jerred said to me a while go, keeps coming back to mind. "You will never be able to fully trust your husband/wife, no matter what)" and that makes me sad now. I was to be able to trust my God fully. Which i hope i do. and my husband, being a man that seeks God, should be able to die for me, just like Jesus died for the Church. And i should trust that my husband is putting me above himself. I dont know if that is an unreal thing to think about. I hope not. I really do hope i can trust my husband.  Anyways. Today was a crappy day. i woke up at 3:30 this morning and the bathroom was my best friend. About 6 different times it was my best friend. So yea, i got to see all that i ate for the last 2 months. So yea. That was sad. And i was all alone so, atleast my hair was pulled back! But other then that. Yesterday was great.  O wow... i need to get something off my brain.. I know why i have to much pride and ih ave been looking the gift of prayer... Cause i'm useing it, and i'm not praying for others, and with others. With is a huge thing for some reason. I have no clue why that is. All i know is praying with others is different then praying by myself. Or just talking with god just him and i, or talking with him and i and others. is that right?

      My sisters birthday was today, pretty sweet huh? I liked it. She seems to be very happy about your new cell phone, which is cute always... But a thought that came to my mind sometime today, was how important relationships our. But why? "God made us for that" I think theres more then that. I dont know, something i was just thinking about, maybe i'm sillyness... My sister and i are reading out of Isaiah right now, and last night she read 5, and i liked it. At frist i hated the fact that she was reading slower, but it helped. Once you slow down with something, you are able to bust out your thinking skills even more. But we read something that touced my heart. for some reason. But before i leave with the verses and stuff i want to tell yal' that its a weird chapter, but a true one. Well not weird. Its about what is, and has gone on with God. So sad we have been a disapointment to him. He wanted us to be sweet, beautiful, wonderful and [pleaseing but something happend to his group of peoples.  1Now I will sing a song for the one I love about his vineyard:      My beloved has a vineyard         on a rich and fertile hill. 2     He plowed the land, cleared its stones,         and planted it with choice vines.     In the middle he built a watchtower         and carved a winepress in the nearby rocks.     Then he waited for a harvest of sweet grapes,         but the grapes that grew were wild and sour. 3     "Now, you people of Jerusalem and Judah,         you have heard the case; you be the judges. 4     What more could I have done         to cultivate a rich harvest?     Why did my vineyard give me wild grapes         when I expected sweet ones? 5     Now this is what I am going to do to my vineyard:     I will tear down its fences         and let it be destroyed.     I will break down its walls         and let the animals trample it. 6     I will make it a wild place.         I will not prune the vines or hoe the ground.         I will let it be overgrown with briers and thorns.     I will command the clouds         to drop no more rain on it." 7     This is the story of the LORD's people.         They are the vineyard of the LORD Almighty.         Israel and Judah are his pleasant garden.     He expected them to yield a crop of justice,         but instead he found bloodshed.     He expected to find righteousness,         but instead he heard cries of oppression.

      I am not all knowing... I am not wise... I dont know anything... I can't think for myself, and when i do, its never the right thing.... I am not understanding. I am nothing... I truly am. So why do i try and make it more? Cause... I think i am understanding. I think i can know all things. But i can't. And i dont. And untill i am totally pushed down, and humbled, i'm going to be saying i am nothing, untill i am humble...

      So my mind sucks... yea thats right, it blows! i say that cause everytime i worship, i make it about me. I mean, not worship, sing to my God... (Which is an act of worship, but not worship) Now i think about my God. And i try my hardest to look at him. but my mind goes of to, what if this person was here with me singing/playing with me? Kind of sad huh? So last night a thought that came to my mind; i think about praising in front of people, then why dont i? Then a thought came to mind... NO! lol... I was scared. So i think i'm just going to stick to my one person watching me... But a song i was taking part in tonight was talking about our fathers hands on the cross and stuff. And wow... I so over look that... yea yea i was died for, yea yea... but wow. A thought that will never sink in, and thats sad. Now about the cross.... Dont get me worong, i am not a hater or anything of it, but i just have a different thought about it i guess... But i dont see whats so wonderful about it... "Thats where our sins were taken away" POOP! Who cares where... i care about WHO was there. The cross had nothing to do with it (from my way of thinking) the blood was the thing that saved us. A thought came to my mind while i was praying about this (seeing if this is the way i should be thinking or not) and it was my own thinking i know that for sure, but if a gun killed our God (Jesus)then we would all be having a gun around our necks and on our alters... So yea, i guess i dont see whats so wonderful, also, why not have a tome (grave) around our necks? I mean he rose from the died!!! Thats awesome, i would be saying yay for life and not for death. But its just the way my silly mind works...But o well... I tried to go to small groups tonight but amber wasn't feeling well, so hopefully later she does...

      I am a waste.. Really. Why would people call me a friend? I am not a freakin friend. Why would someone call me a child of theres. I'm not a freakin child. Its meaningless.. All of it. no really. Me sitting in my room thinking that all is well, is crap. Thinking that i'm a pretty good friend, thats bigger crap. If i were a good friend, i would have friends... For people who might be reading this... which there is like no one reading this i'm sure. Yal' are good people. REally. Good people. But i'm not a friend. I dont call. I dont hang out. I dont do anything. Yet i wonder why i sit around thinking i want to go out. And i can't think of anyone to go with. Is this me feeling sorry for myself? Yep...Probley. Its a waste of time. Trying to make it in this world. maybe i'm just upset cause i can't make it. I mean i can't make it now. I can't keep a relationship going? Why do i even try?

      So last night Christian and I got into a fight. Alyssa, Christian and I were playing cards and i got tired and borad of doing that, so i said i'm done, and came in and started talking to Rick on the computer. My sister and Alyssa came in and said that we can all play Truth and dare. I said no, i hate that game. After i said that about 5 different times, my sister starting going on about how i never play with them, and i'm always on the computer. (Which upseted me, cause it was half way true, but also the fact that i just got  done playing cards with them for an hour)So i truned off the computer and said, with a big hint of angry "Fine, lets go play your stupid ass game"........ I went into the living room and sat there for about 15 min.s by myself, trying not to this how stupid i just was. Alyssa later came out and just sat there. I went into T and Is' room and said our we going to play or not. And all she said was i didn't have to cuss. And she was right. I didn't have to be angry with her. I didnt have to yell at her. So i said sorry. but i knew, that wouldn't make a difference. Sadly we all came out into the living room, and said nothing. so i got up and said well this is a weaste of time. My sister and i later forgot about it. But Alyssa stayed out in the living room talking about her home life. Tina came out and sat down with me. We were both able to love each other. Alyssa went on saying how great Tina and i have our relationship. All i could was laugh. Seeing how i jsut yelled at her and cussed the first time in a year. And i felt horrible. That isn't something a women after Gods heart does. So why did i do it? I wish i knew. I was just angry. Said. I feel like i have to yell to get my point arcoss, no matter who it is with. Why is that? Something i need to work on. thats for sure...

       So for some reason i hate just being happy... Let me explain. Happy is something that comes and goes. Joy is finding happiness in something even when everything else seems poopie...Get it? heh i didn't think so, but i understand it... Let tell yal' something that has been on my mind alot latlly.. My looks. Now i am trying not to make a big deal of it. But i dont like my stomack. i seem to be getting...bigger... Not to the place where i'm like a cow but i sure do feel like it. Its poopie! Well do something about it Cassy if you dont like it so much... Yea i know, i'm just lazy. I mean thats what got me hear in the first place.    Well i had a great day to tell yal' the truth. i didn't do anything, just played games with Rick, talked to Kyle and Ed...Ed by the way called me a sang to me... awww.... What a sweet heart.&nbsp; It wasn't that bad either. Kyle was on for the first time in about a week. I asked why, seeing how he wasn't going to come on till Friday. But he said he just wanted to talk. So, i was happy. No really, i was sooo excited to talk to him. I love talking to him. i really didn't talk much when he was on cause i was playing a game with Rick and mostly Ed needed to talk about something that he has been having hard time with latly.    As for last nights post, its what i was feeling. I felt like crap. And half of me still feels like i am unwothy of alot of my friendship. But God died for me, he say me as being worth it... So i should know that, and he choose me to have these relationships.. And i'm loving it! The beauty in it all...   I read Jerred X thingy, and he has a new girlfriend, Ashley... How awesome, she sounds like someone he can, and already has, fallen in love with... I'm happy for him... Which is weird. He has always been my weakness. And i mean that! i would have done anything to be with this guy, but when he wanted to be with me, i wouldn't go for it. Mostly cause i knew it was wrong... but last night i really thought that&nbsp;i could just call him and get back together. Which sadly, i didn't want. lol... I really didn't want to. but my lustful thoughts did. I mean they were screaming! But i didnt. And when i woke up this morning i spent alittle time with my God and it was a true Joy... A new life... and it was a blessing.    Rick i just wanted to put something in here for you... I love you. Now the truth is i hate saying that, cause&nbsp;i have lost the meaning of that with so many other people. But i do love you. And thank you, and Thank God for you everyday... Thank you so much for my mine... Naked kisses!!!!

        So i'm reading a new book. "trusting God" Jerry Bridges... The truth is while pickin' out a book to read for this summer i had a hard time. There was just so much i wanted to read, but yet so little... I didn't want to get a big book cause i didn't think&nbsp;i was going to read it. So i got an meduim book. Which is ok. But i need to get book, and read them! But i first grabed C.S lewis, cause the truth is i want to read one of his books, however, he seems like a very smart guy, someone that i wouldn't be able to keep up with, thinking wise... I'm not saying i'm stupid, just i have to re-read one line from his book about 4 different time just to understand what he is saying, then i could start thinking about it... Then i was going to get a smaller book, and i really wanted to, i loved the last one i read. From the same writer. I called him Dude... But the guy really just got to me, and i got thinking... but i didn't. Then i was going to get a book about dating... "Dateble" I hread it was really good, and i do want to read it, but a thought came to mind. I'm not waiting to deal with&nbsp;my dating stuff. I mean yea it blows, but i am not good at dating. The whole thing. Meeting...Friendships, courting, dating, closeness...all of it... Why you may ask...I dont know. Maybe i'm just not happy with who i have datied so far. My eyes seem to have been closed for some time now, and i was just slapped by Kyle... Now seeing that there is guys out that, that i have been looking for. Speaking of Kyle... About a week ago we were talking about how much we wanted to date. and he said something that i was thinking about a week before him and i even started talking that day. "I think God put you in my life just so i can know what to look for"....All i could say is wow. Him and i talk about things i have been thinking about, but i dont even have to bring it up, he does... But it was true. I think God put that on OUR hearts, to let us no, there is no chance for you two, but there is a chance for you and someone else, just like this person. And to tell you the truth, that is a bummer. Cause i haven't found him yet. But thats ok. More time for me to perpare for him, and perpare for my God...     A thought came to my while i was reading. "I'm going to war..." Scary? Well for all those Christians out that reading this... Your going too! But i am being perpared for war... Aganist Satan i mean. Now i have a thought, and i dont know if it is true or not... But when the end comes. When G-man comes down and juges those dead and not dead, we all in heaven and on earth that believe have to go anainst the prince of darkness (like that!) But i have a different battel, starting Aug. 23... School. Wow... What am i going to do this next year? Am i going to go to a place where morals dont always top the charts on peoples listes of life... Am i going to sit there, and be conterable?&nbsp;I shouldn't be... I have gotten to the place where i am very comfterable. I mean wow! This is easy. Why... Cause the only people i talk to about God are people who already know him... And those who dont know him that talk to me, about wanting to get to know him, i sheepisly shy away from the convo... So how am i going to live this next year out? Am i going to look back on it and say, no different? Well i know that i'm not going to be willing to go out there, cause i am not going to be welcomed all the time, but theres going to be one person. that one person that says man, God i want you... And guess what... i need to think thats worth every bit of it...      So about trusting god... I do a crappy job of it. So hopfully i will get better at it...

       So i'm reading someone elses post on something else for girls and dating. and this young lady was talking about how when she went to camp she was soooo happy, and just on fire for God, but when she got back, she tried talking to God again, and its like God wasn't there.... I thought&nbsp;it was&nbsp;funny to hear this all. Or read it i should say...seeing how everyone goes through it. The high on God, cause your a way. And i dont think there is noting wrong with it, i mean we all go through that time. i know i did. But after a while you relieaze&nbsp;God is more then just a camp&nbsp;high that you can only get when you are around your church friend, and away from home...&nbsp;So...speaking of retreats my youth church is having one, and to tell yal' the truth, i'm not like "o thank God!" Its no big deal for me... I'm been blessed to get on a high for God,every time i talk to him, every time i read his word, everytime i say "i'm going to do this for the Lord"...Those our my highs...As for my best friend, he does get high on God....However, getting away is something he seems to need.... Seeing how someone esle wont be there, i can only hope god blesses this retreat and helps him before the retreat...    So again...i'm the only one out of all my friends that isn't dating....Except for the few...But guess what.... Its a blessing! O my gosh...I love it. i love not having a boyfriend...i wonder why i didn't do this sooner...heh... And i leave with this note, something T and i read last night... From Isaish 8:13 - "Do not fear anything except the LORD Almighty. He alone is the Holy One. If you fear him, you need fear nothing else."

       I'm sitting here right now watching a show about Jesus. On the history channel. And i dont think they have said anything yet about Jesus being the savior. But they are talking about HIM, saying how he died and so forth. I just started watching it about 2 minutes ago and its talking about the cloth that covered him. Seein how there is an inprint on it of him and his blood. And i thought it was kind of funny how everyone is saying whats the big deal of this dued, he means nothing. Yet the world is excited about him, wanting to know more. Kind of weird. If this worlds finds out that this is the son of God and the son of man...What will they do?    As for myself i have been alittle down today. Other then my high for driving. i have been&nbsp; faced with the fact that i am not a good person to talk to...I was talking to Jerred and i had nothing to talk about... Matt... the same thing. Katie, and Shannon. And o man... i didn't know what to say. I hate it... I'm just not good at relationships...

I was watching "AMericas' most wanted" and they were talking about the lady that is missing now, and how cops believe her husband killed her.  Sadly she was expecting a baby. They were planning on moving cause the husband was going to be doctor and finsih school there. Sadly that never happend (I sound like the guy from the stupid tv) The fact is, they think he killed her, and is going act like a looney. I guess he was working in one of those place where people go when they brake down.. man... What happend to the world? Why get married when all your going to do is kill them? What happend with deviorse... (I know i didn't spell that right but work with  me) i hate that also... but its better then killing someone, come on! Well i had to get that out. how much i hate that... Its stupid and my goodness... just stupid. Whats going on in the world that is making people crazy. Is it the water? Everyone blams water, i thought i would too...    Two: This is alittle more on my life and my best friends life. First off. I think i am a cold hearted person... heh. Trust me, y'all will agree. Whats going on with my bestest friend is; him and i have known each other for about 5 years. And in that time him and i have talked alot. I mean wow. And that hasn't changed. No matter who i date, or who he dates. (As for one of my entrys saying i lost him, i was just being silly, but said what i felt) Well he started dating about a year ago, and so far nothing good has come out of him dating. Other then knowing girls more then just as friends... I think... (THIS IS ALL WHAT I THINK IS GOING ON.. IF YOU WANT TO REALLY KNOW, TALK TO HIM!  just wanted to get that point arcoss) Well he started liking a girl... and they were going to wait. But something happend and they didn't... Now lets just stop right here. So i can put my imput in. She was waiting for someone else. This someone else and her were going to date. But he started dating someone else. I forget who. now at this same time, this girl and My best friend were talking... If my timing is wrong please tell me... anyways... so they dropped the whole waiting thing and started dating. Why? I have asked i think both of them that. And i think they just say cause we wanted to... As for my best friend i know that he REALLY wanted to. But her, i can't help but feel like she started dating my  best friend cause she couldn't have the other guy. but i wouldn't know. My feelings towards this: My best friend is just something that you can pick up cause you were let off... Now thats about the only thing right now that is bothering me, that i am going to tell... The fact is, she is still messing with his head even though they aren't together... This girl i care for, dont get me wrong! She is the nicest girl, and sweeties... But why? If you brake up with someone, dont act like your together still, dont tell him "well it might all change" Its a bunch of crap...I think she is doing this cause she doesn't want to hurt him, but she doesn't want to be with him... I have done that, but i dont know if thats what she is doing. I pray not. I dont know, i know its not my problem and i shouldn't be saying anything. And i know! But at what point to you say something when your best friend is being pushed around? Well i have told my best friend what i think. i hope i have... But her, she doesn't talk to anyone! But she does talk to Ryan and Eddie. And i know that. And thats great. But seeing how i dont know whats going on inside the relationship i have not right at all to say something to her... but man... This is just stupid...    Well about me. I'm just blah... I'm fighting with... myself. And i pray that the part that wants God more and more, doesn't lose to the part that is only on the right now... TTFN   I love you Rick! Naked kisses!

       Well today was just today.... It was bad or anything, however my attuide was... For the last couple of days i have been working myself pretty hard... I desire something that God hasn't, doesn't, and wont give me. So i have been agureeing through that with  myself. The fact is, i need to be smart... But sadly i have desired to live the way of the world, stupid, unsatfiying, and unwilling... Then theres the way i feel. About myself. Today i had a really really bad attuide, i was just tired. I wanted to get out, do something, anything. Weither pleaseing to God or not... I think thats why i didn't do anything at all. I wasn't trying for my God... Does anyone else go through this... Where you and God are totally awesome, so you really want to keep that relationship good, you read your bible, you pray, you reach, you are the greatest Christian on the plant when your great with God... Yet when you get into a valley, what happens? For me, i try and get a way from God... Dont ask me why. I guess cause somewhere in my mind i deisre to be alittle "bad girl" Yet when i do something "bad", which really is stupid, i feel like i let my Father down.. (Meaning God) I dont know. I tired of being here... Not that i dont love people. Not that i dont want to be with people. But i want to leave...    I have fallen in love with two songs. And one of them is "Beautiful" By Bethany Dillon. I was just listening to it. Am i truly beautiful? Are you? Who can say that? And i dont mean all the make-up, hair, eyes, crap... I mean really am i beautiful? Does my heart shout for joy when someone i truly love finds happiness, when i am stuck here waiting for my God seeking man to find me and tell me that he loves me... Am i truly putting other above myself? Am i being true? There are so many things with beauty... but i dont hold any of them... Why do i talk so low of myself? Cause i know whats inside... Only God and i see what everyone else doesn't see in my heart... I'm sure God sees more then even i do with my heart. But the fact is i'm not a beautiful woman after Christ... But he is a beautiful man after a worthless soul...

       Well i have been thinking latly... About my husband. I'm excited..But  I talked with God tonight, and to tell the truth alot about this... And the same thing comes to mind.. Am i putting this dream of being a wife, a mother. More to me then my God?Is it wrong to desire this life of a wife, and maybe a mother? Should i be praying about it? Meaning should i pray that God will grant me with this man? I know God will grant me with whatever pleases him... But my thinking is, am i desiring it to much? Am i putting to much on it? I hope i'm not... I'm not putting my life off for this man of my dreams... But i hope i am putting my heart off for this man... Thats an even bigger thing... Am i placeling my heart somewhere others cant get to... Well the thing on my heart right now is if my heart is on God... More then this guy... I pray it is...

       Well i dont have a whole lot to talk about...  However, i have worked. I clean so far, and make lauch for two 90 year old people... They were in World War two... I love it! I hear about them, and what they have been through... Something now.. .that i have alot to say about...   Out reach... It was put on my heart by a dear friend, Kyle, that i need to stop sitting around thinking someone else will reach for God, and i dont have to. So i wanted to go out... Right then right there. But couldn't, seeing how it was 2 in the morning and my dad would kill me if i did so. But now i'm scared... I wanted to cry just like two min.s ago talking to Kyle. The fact is i always get the heart to go out, but i never EVER do go out... I starting making excusses... And i have the feeling like i need to do this... I need to get uncomfterable... But i dont want to... I'm soo tired of being a wussy...
