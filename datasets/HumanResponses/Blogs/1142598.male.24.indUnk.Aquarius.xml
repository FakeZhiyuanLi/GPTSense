And i thought i might never see her again after disappearing from the block beside mine... Its good to know more friends... genuine ones  Went for nation education today... from little india to chinatown... Seems funny as i know nuts about our indian friends and all that bangala-s holding hands and their religion... Kinda relate well to that really cramped up cubicles our ancestors used to lived in during WW2 cos... cos i also dunno why... juz feels very familiar... you know deja-vu Oh well more exams coming up tml... ever tried self study 10 chapters and have ecam the next day? This is how AFS train us... 3 hrs of sleep aday and you juggle the 3 hrs sleep with whatever is left...  Cant yak-kati any more... *winks @ ying* Dun be angry k??

      woot! just got a hp from my cuzzie! the same ancient old 8210!! Guess i could talk to her in-camp again!! boy am i in luvvvvvv or infatuated... Sammy says i should get 7610... little did she knew (or did i tell her?) that i really like 7610 but its kinda wasted to hide this sweeet phone in-camp since i'm staying in... but hey, i like it, she proposed it, why not? THE REASON keeps ringing in my head... i'm not perfect but we all know when in luv, whats impossible?  "I'm not a perfect person , i never meant to do those things to you  And so i have to say before i go that i just want you to know  I found a reason for me to change who i used to be  A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I found a reason to show the side of me you didnt know  A reason for all that i do  And the reason is you"

      Thanx to Huiying, here i am, rekindle my blogg... its been like so long since last update... So many things has happened... Ppl come and go, NS screws up my lifestyle and worse, old man like me almost never stood up again...  Well ok, lets see... went down to Chinablack with samantha last night, its was one of the happiest moment i had after Aug 21 2003... she so attractive in her simple spagett and jeans combi... think both of us were the best dancers around shaking our butts and mellowed down dirty dancing haha  But oh yes, you guessed it, good things always comes with the bad, to balance the nature *pui*... her ex 6 yrs ago was there! And guess what?! He weeped infront of us because wimpy still wants samantha and cant take it when wimpy sees her with me!  Samantha is a sweet, attractive and kind-hearted lady whom recently just found her long-lost mummy of 20 yrs... She couldnt snap out of this guilt wimpy has been poisioning her for yrs... And God did wimpy claim he still luvsssss her... my arse!  Reason she's still in contact with wimpy because 1) the guilt 2)friendship but Low and Behold, here is the definition of FRIEND taken from dictionary.com: 1)A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts. 2)A person whom one knows; an acquaintance. 3)A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade. 4)One who supports, sympathizes with, or patronizes a group, cause, or movement: friends of the clean air movement. 5)Friend A member of the Society of Friends; a Quaker. Thats exactly what i explained last night or rather early this morning except #5...  I know this is a little confusing... NO, sammy's not my gal *yet* and YES, we know how we felt for each other but because of wimpy and friends... things just got complicated... I hate it when a gentle person be it HIM, HER or SHIM (though i have way lesser tolerant for them) gets abused emotionally and mentally... These characters are used for the better of those around you not just to your advantage! Bloody hell... bugger off kenneth wimp! If it was not for samantha i swear this would end the savage way...  Ah btw, sammy said wimpy stared at me few weeks back when he was waiting in q to black... why din you just walk up and hit me? Aint got any balls huh? If i had knew that wimp crying was you, nah i wont hit you, at least not infront of sammy...
