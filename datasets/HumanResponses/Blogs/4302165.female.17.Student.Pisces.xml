      The man that had been prank calling us at work for the past two week has moved on to a new low and begun calling Joe and his girlfriend at their home. The MO is the same; frequent hang ups or obscenities and threats but this time it's obvious that Joe is the target. Furthermore, when Joe isn't at work, the calls don't happen.  The police have gotten involved, and from what Joe tells me, they have leads and/or already know who the caller is. Yesterday, he put up a notice on the board at work, informing everyone that the police are involved and that it better stop, or charges will be pressed. This, of course, leads me to believe that the person doing it either a) works with us or b) is a former employee, but at the advice of the police, Joe won't say who it is. He did, however, give what I think is a big hint. Walking into the room, he looked right at me, shrugged his shoulders and said, "What's good?! You're going to jail!"  The only person I have ever known to use the phrase 'what's good' was a former employee by the name of Frank. And Frank, being the idiot that he is, would be stupid enough to do something like this. When I asked Joe if that was supposed to be some kind of hint as to the identity of his pranker, he just shook his head very innocently. I have no other proof that it is Frank that's doing it, but I wouldn't put it past him.  Joe has the phone number of the guy who was calling us the first week it happened, but when he called it yesterday to have me listen to the voicemail message, the guy who picked said that he "found the phone." Later his story changed to having bought the phone on the street and that he was trying to sell it back to it's owner. Joe offered him $100 for it if he would come down to the restaurant, in broad daylight and with myself and Diana as witnesses and give him the phone. The man refused, so Joe offered him as much money as he had in his pocket ($650 which I counted myself) to sell it to him, but the man again refused, saying that if Joe wasn't the owner than he wasn't going to sell it to him. Joe told him that he didn't believe him, but if he would just look down the list of recent outgoing calls and read him off repeat numbers, he would still pay him $100. This, apparently, was 'against his morals' and the man refused. Joe called him on his bluff and told him he believed that it was his phone, and that he would be calling the police, but I left before he could do so.  I don't really want to get involved with this; I'm already involved with way too much other 'business', but I supposed I'll help Joe out if he needs it. After all, if it is Frank that's doing it, I'm more than willing to take the bastard down.  Kachel  PS- Chris Luna is getting brave behind a keyboard. The boy has to learn that if he's going to play with fire, he's going to get burned. I'm not the type of girl to put up with innuendos and conceited flirting when I already made it clear I'm not interested. It's like baiting an angry wolf....

      One of the most foolish things you can do in life is to put yourself into a situation that you know you can't handle. Or, possibly more foolishly, to  stay  in such a situation. Based on that theory, I am possibly one of the most foolish people of my age.  Simply put, I hate people. I am a certifiable misanthrope for some reason took a job that requires me to not only deal with large amounts of people, but forces me to rely on them to make any kind of money at all. To sum it up, I work in the service industry. The restaurant industry more specifically. I live off my tips, which I can only get by spending long streches of time dealing with and sucking up to ridiculous people.  Of the thousands and thousands of people I have dealt with in the short year I have spent working where I do, only about 3% show signs of basic human morals or intelligences. The rest seem to have absolutely no consideration for other people or their time. I can't even count how many times people have called to place a phone order for food, only to make me wait while they call to people in the background and squabble over what they want to eat. Common courtesy and respect for my job on my part keeps me from hanging up on them completely or asking them to call back, but nonetheless it's  rude.  I have other things to do too. My time is just as valuable.  Moreover, I hate to be ignored. I will always give my costumers the benefit of the doubt and greet them not only kindly, but friendlily. When I approach my table and say hi, ask them how they're doing and they just look up and stare blankly before going back to what they were doing or ignore me completely and pretend I'm not there, it tends to put me off. I'm not asking for a lot; simply acknowledge the fact that  I  have come over to serve  you.   What's more, I despise it when people treat me like a servant or someone socially below them. By that I mean: snapping your fingers to get my attention like I'm some kind of dog rather than a person, calling me over and telling me your ready to order then making me stand there and wait while you decide what you want to eat, interrupting me with something trivial when I'm  clearly  busy doing something else, etc. I understand that people need things, but if you'd just wait the few seconds until I finish up taking a phone order I can help you a lot better.  I know many people will say that I should stop complaining because, hey, this is my job and that's what being a waitress entails and hell, I'm getting paid damn good for it. In reality, that's not the case. My hourly wage is $2.13. Yes, $2.13 a hour. The only real money I make is in tips, and the people I serve are overwhelmingly cheap. On a bill of $30 or $40, I may only get $2 or $3. And it's not because the costumer believes the service was bad. Not to be conceited, but I am not a bad waitress. That isn't the problem because every single server in the place has the exact some problem. Simply put, people are cheap and ungrateful. Anyone that has done it can tell you that waiting tables is a physically demanding job. It can be hard; and when people are rude or cheap, it's even harder.  The lesson in all of this can be summed up very easily: "service depends on my mood and your attitude."  If I recognize you as a chronic cheapskate regular, your service might not be as good as it can be. Other than that; I give you my best, and I expect only the same courtesy in return.  -Kachel
