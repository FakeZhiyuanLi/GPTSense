      Can any body tell mi wtf is going on? The euro2004 is becoming a lousy tournament.. First Italy keno knockout, then Spain, England, and now France is also out... Its getting boring sia.. And teams like GREECE is in the semi final of the competition.. Yah , yesterday France did play poorly , but they shouldn't be out of the tournament so early... And yah, fei fei .. Thank for ur 90% France sure win prediction.. whahaa.. And France lose the match.. lolX.. So no onli left Holland in euro2004 that i hope they can win it.. So starting from tonite.. Hope they can at least win Sweden and qualify for the next round...Cheers for Holland..

      HaiZz…. And this is how cruel it can be.. England is out of Euro2004.  And there is surely one person that should be blame for England defeat. The blame doesn’t fall on beckham and vassell penalty miss, eriksson tactic, or rooney injury.. But it falls on the referee Urs Meier.. And yes, this ref is from Swiss and throughout the game, he had been siding the home side that is Portugal.. Really pissed of while watching.. There is contrasting feeling when watching the game.. After Owen score the opening goal jus after 3 min.. I was like so happy,whahaha.. Then for the next 80 min of the game.. It was so nervous as Portugal had been throwing the entire attacking player onto the field and England was surely on the backfoot.. But they did hold on until this very moment when this stupid idiot SIMAO SABRASO who cross the ball for HELDER POSTIGA

      Look What You've Done  by Jet   Album : Get Born   Take my photo off the wall if it just won't sing for you, 'Cause all that's left has gone away and there's nothing there for you to prove,  Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone, Oh well, it seemed like such fun until you lose what you had won Ooh oo  Give me back my point of view 'cause I just can't think for you, I can hardly hear you say, what should I do? Well you choose  Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone, Oh well, it seems like such fun until you lose what you had won, Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone A fool of everyone, A fool of everyone  Take my photo of the wall if it just won't sing for you, 'Cause all that's left has gone away and there's nothing there for you to do  Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone, Oh well, it seems like such fun until you lose what you had won, Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone A fool of everyone, A fool of everyone     Vindicated  by Dashboard Confessional   Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in  So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing  I am captivated,  I am...   [Chorus]  Vindicated  I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  Swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So clear  Like the diamond in your ring  Cut to mirror your intention  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me so isolated, so motivated  I am certain now that I am...   [Chorus]   So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x]  So let me slip against the current  So let me slip away [4x]   [Chorus]   Like hope  Dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption...
