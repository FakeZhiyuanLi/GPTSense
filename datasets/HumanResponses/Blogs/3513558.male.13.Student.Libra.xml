      Well, one major event took place.  Uh, well, sort of tired today, and pissed. Wanted to sleep in the sleeping bag yesterday but dad thought it was a joke. Now i got cold. FUCK SPYDY  Today is quite slack lar...  1st period, English. slack slack slack.  2nd period is Jap. I got back my result. 40/100. Screwed up. At least i got 18/20 for Kanji. ehehe  i pitched balls against the walls. Nobody dared to swing his bat because of the breaking of glass yesterday. ehehehe  Third period was Science. well, slack slack slack. Did nothing.  4th period was... uh, hold on. English conversation period. Well, Ms Frank must go for Crashed Wedding (lolz, "BUSTED"'s crash wedding) so Ms. Hamaguchi must manage the whole class including boys. Well, the boys are more quiet when girls are around. ehehe, good tactic dude.  Played baseball in the lunch break. Lunch was okie.  5th period was maths. Did a mock test and it was fuck hard about trigonometry. WTF. HELP!  6th period was Computer, wtf talk so much crap. can'T you let me touch the com?  on the bus back home, Wakao joked with me about his girlfriend. Hiromi eavesdropped, but failed. eheheh, pestered but i refused. I CAN'T BELIEVE WAKAO LIKES HIROMI! well, she's chio and her bro is a baseball pro but relac lar, got more hot chicks you know!  okie, at night we went to AEON to collect our CD player. it was beautiful, magnificent and most importantly, sleek. Bought Good Charlotte and it costs 2520 yen! That's like about 40 bucks! Dad's real crazy.  anyway, i am tired, gotta sign out nightz.  Squabbling with biqing. mentally weak  Thought of the day: Money is there for you to spend and not to bai swee.

      Well, another girl's case. Sighz, i will come back to that later.  Today i must go back ta schooL! NO!!!! bleak, i wanted to slack and laze in the burning hot yellow ball (the sun lar). The 1st period was a speech by an old skrewt about not wasting time and learn the fact that you come to school to study, not to play. Uh, DUH?! but i think only Kousuke Ueda is listening. The rest slept. ehehehe  2nd period was England. I got back my results. I got 100. DUH?! I am a native speaker from Singapore and don't get 100? I screw my balls man, but Kousuke got higher than me. That mugger. haiz. it was like something upon 105? eheheh, he got 102 and i got 101. but the teacher give a FUCK sh!t damn and rounded us all to 100  Had our break. Pitch the tennis ball onto the wall. My senior, Tsuyoshi Mabuchi, was sort of impressed. He needs to "ling mu xiang kan"(look at the person with another eye). ehehe. He also advised me to lift my leg up a little more higher. I dunno why but dad say it helps to boost the speed. Whatever.  3rd period was bio. Got back my paper and it was the first one i managed to have a grin on my face. 73. Satisfactory. many people failed though. ehehe, you guys better buck up. A foreigner got 73 okie.  4th period was home economics. BORING OLD SH!T. dozed off.  Ehehheeh.  Lunch was like CRAP. didn't even managed to finish the rice.  My lunch break was spent on playing baseball with the sec 3s. I struck some people out. ehehehe...  5th period was SOCIETY. omFg. I was afraid, but my fear was overcome by the joy when my result came to my desk. 75. not bad huh...  6th period was Maths and it was the BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT. I GOT ONLY 59! but i can't blame anyone because i didn'T have the textbook in the first place. After the swapping of seats in the 5th period, i was surrounded by girls and luckily nobody wanted to see my result. Kuge was fucking bitching around my bad mood.  okie, i met this girl i found it quite chio lar. But i don't really like her. I think she likes me. Whatever. Her name is called Takada and she sort of wanted to come near me everywhere i went. yea, at least she is chio unlike some Dog who bitch around and smack my head with hard substance (kuge lar). Okie. Takada met me near the canteen. She initiated the "hi there" and i waved back. Chihiro, my senior was also there and waved back. Somebody muttered "you know him?!". Wow, am i that famous?  went home and played com and bla bla bla... You should know. Supper was Udon.  yawnz, gotta sleep  muakz  eheheheheheheh  lolz  Thought of the day: Just Do It

      I know this is sort of public, but i must admit that if i don't commit some of my secretes to you, life won't be fun. My heart will also feel so painful. I will come to that later.  Well, woke up latee and went to shop. AGAIN. wtf... nvm. ate Sushi for Lunch, walked around AEON for a while and bought CD player, Adidas shirt, sleeping bag (lolz) and a basketball. Quite "ouch"ful for Dad's pocket. lolzy  okiez, i shall tell my part, my secrets.  There is this girl, I met on the bus to Meitoku (Now stop thinking of finding her, she's in Japan). It was after school. Well, i sat in a cramped bus, yeouch. And then Nakajima introduced her to me as i was "strumming" my guitar. omFg. My first impression was: chio. A beauty she is. She is one year my junior. Perfect.  I wanted to ask her her name. Damn fuck Nakajima an irritating bastard come screwing up my conversation with her. well, that girl thinks i am alright. Waves to me when she sees me. I sort of... find her cute when i haven't had that feeling for years? lolz, but i muz say i give up lolz. coz i believe when she grows up, she will be in the celebrity circle. She has a pretty face and guess what? Golfer. Wtf. I think she will have countless boyfriends. DEH, better stop before i start to like her. Lolz  ah, well. Feel much better writing that  Thought of the day: 1 life, live it

      It wasn't another boring old friday. it was an  extraordinary  friday. Today was worth a thousand fridays and trainings to understand the real baseball.  IF people say, "Since you broke your arm, you cannot play anymore. Well, we are sad too". Hang on, i disagree with that. I will come to that later.  Well umm... we got the shortest day in history. We had our maths test and game over. Quite an easy piece of work with questions like: What is 4a + a - 5b + 3b. Well, i guess it's primary school stuff... slept after 10 minutes.  Went home and slammed guitar and play com. A guy called Jinba came to my house to play. he missed all my fu*k shots in my games. nvm.  Went to eat in canteen. Menu was curry rice.   We later went to the city hall for my visa renewal. That was the FILTHIEST building i seen in some years, and it was a  city hall .   ...  Well, we went out. I went to the batting centre along with dad. Managed to hit some balls. also played the arcade games over there. what a boring waste of time i realise, and money, not to forget. I hit those 110km/h balls hard. then i swung my bat and felt it was alright. I went to the softball machine and noticed one card still had credit. BleAk, took it and set it to 100km/h. Not bad, but got some air balls and can feel the wind. lolzy  okie, went to  BOOK OFF  and well, read  MAJOR  and it gave me the incredulous motivation to spur me on. I read almost about 8 volumes and I realised how wonderful the fighting spirit of the little kiddos play baseball in Japan. This isn't the realm where books dominate. Brains are in fact a worthless organ in studies but a precious computer chip in the game. Strategic thinking acts as a wonderful web to cling everybody in the pitch together.   The protagonist,  Gorou Honda  was an arrogant but miraculous player during his primary school times. He was a pitcher and pitched wonderful balls that travel at 110km/h. Imagine that talent on that pitch. However, his route to succes is taunted by his thought of  one man show . he later learnt how to work with each other in his club  Mifune Little and finally, they beat the best primary school team in Japan,  Yokohama Little . His strong rivalry with  Toshiya Satou  urges him to work harder and harder if not he will catch him up. Satou was a typical nerd in the block but Gorou helped him to undersatnd the interesting game. He then became the ace Yokohama Little. Imagine the  ACE  of  Yokohama Little .  Their rivalry was not stopped even in their Secondary schooling. As a result of their clash, Gorou damaged his shoulder which is essential for the pitcher. Depressed, he could not over come his sadness and had to join the soccer team. However, his stepfather encouraged him to be a Southpaw. "...Even if the result wouldn't be as marvellous as your right hand, i am sure you wouldn't want to leave the mount at such a young age. Sure, if you really can't continue, you can still be the world's best slugger"  By transferring to East Mifune, he met his old friends who were in Mifune little. The center fielder had his dream of being a J-leaguer and didn't pursue his baseball career. The only female outfielder,  Kaoru Shimizu  was in the softball club and with the foundations set up by her early baseball days, she then became the captain of East Mifune's softball captain. That leaves only one boy,   Daisuke Komori , who was yet another simple minded boy. He was the catcher for Gorou but after their secondary days, they had to bid each other farewell as they go for their dream high school. After Toshiya and Gorou's clash in the finals, Gorou emerged champion and the top high school wanted to enrol him. However, they had to go through a gruelsome test. Their first test was to run around the track as many arounds as possible and the first person who laps the guy lagging behind will be disqualified. The mass number of people will be eliminated to only 5 people.  Gorou, Daisuke and Toshiya managed to pass the first round. The second round was to complete a thousand squats which again eliminated much people. Toshiya and Gorou began to feel the real pain of the tests. Daisuke, with much difficulty, finished it too.  The third test was nothing related to physicals. it was to eat 5 lunches from lunch boxes within 30 minutes. Gorou finished it first. Toshiya came in second. Daisuke wanted to give up. However, he managed to finish it in the last minute. His fighting spirit deserves a round of applause.  The fourth test was to play Penalty Kick. Hang on, not with the soccer ball but with BASEBALL. The goalkeeper will use  no gloves . Gorou booted the person he faced. the second pair was the pair that nobody will expect: Daisuke and Toshiya. At first, their jaws dropped wide open. However, Gorou asked them to give out their best. Toshiya turn out to be the better. After an emotional farewell with Daisuke, Gorou and Toshiya were in for the final test, along with 20 people  With 20 people, Gorou and Toshiya splitted up to form 4 groups. They were expected to play baseball with only 5 people. Gorou and Toshiya formed an invincible pair but Toshiya insisted Gorou to be Center fielder. He had no choice but to let another normal player to pitch. After conceding 2 points, Toshiya ordered Gorou to be shortstop. However, Gorou was not happy but agreed. Upon reading the batter's swing, Gorou began to move to various places people would not expect and caught all the grounders. People were amazed by his analytical ability. Toshiya completed the art with a homerun to help them into the finals.  The finals was against another perfect combo. The pitcher and the catcher were as good as Gorou and Toshiya. However, this time, the pitcher on Gorou's team was unfortunately hit by the ball and injured his arm. Gorou's dream finally came true. He went to the mount and pitched his super fast pitches and struck the pitcher off. Toshiya again touched up the victory by a Homerun at the last innning.  Gorou, Toshiya and their team were in the High school. however, they still had to go through the test that everybody, not just the baseball club, but the whole Japan must take: The enrolment test. Gorou couldn't cope and wanted to quite. However, his stepmother's words were enough even for the teenager to start his mugging nerves working.  "Are you going to lose to books? I know you don't like losing"  Gorou managed to get the hang of the books, thanks to Toshiya. He also became more serious in his work and during lesson time. Although he did not do very well, he managed to get in.  I also want to be like Gorou. I am no different from him. I go to the batting centre often. SheEz. I am not an ordinary boy. I am from ACSi and i went before the best baseball high school in Japan. I will be a southpaw too if i get injured. I will be the best slugger. I won't lose. I am Matthew Ge.

      Yeah, got quite freaked up today. Knew this thing through zhiway. Thanks.   I gotta snooze for some time before i can do something. Darn freak. let'S see, oh well. Managed to mend up all my... sigh... Dad got pissed with me for dunno what reason. Drunk? i dunno lar. Twisted my head like sh!t. He talked with me, ever so happy, that ever so round tummy, ever so funny. Alright.    Went to school, quite happy. I gotta into IB i think coz my average went past the required cut-off: 70. I gotta 74.9, yea, that'S quite umm.. alright. Back to the point. Umm.. alright, the bus to the Jap school, Meitoku, didn't have e freaked up space for me. What, discriminate the Singa from the anonehs issit? loL, i asked someone to get her (yes, her, really got no space) bag away and she moved lohz.    Saiz. and, well, first period: English. bleak, got nothing to say. Boring old crap on present tense.   Jap came next and oso no prob lar. Grammar was, alright. Won't be in the test. didn't bother about it. ahaha  The recess time i spent it with the sec 3s. Ah, Dumb fark, i got striked out thrice by them. BASTERD! WTF! All the sec 1s all looking at me. Strike out. Basterd. The wind make the ball curve (they use tennis ball in case the glass windows will crack and make some fuss if the real leather baseball is used) becoz the ball is so fuking light. hell...   3rd period was English yet again. yea, that tall "model"istic teacher come and buzz around for some crap and sent a student out for no reason. wtf, thank god Ms. Frank (i dunno what) coming to teach next lesson.   bio came straight after that. well, it's a free period. but he asked me to tuck in my shirt. whatever. This was the turning point of my life in Meitoku.   I fooled and bitched around like a stupid kid in the nearby block. I asked a girl to shut up. can you believe? a girl, jap girl with that whatsoever comment you wanna make whether she is chio or not. I dun care whether she's chio. You think i want her? but hey, at least make a good impression to them that the student from Singapore is like a good one? not a person who asks people to fuk off and whatsoever. argh. The next period i decided to keep quiet. yea. sort of worked.   Nothing much. PLayed golf, baseball (vented my triple strike out). The ball sort of went out of shape. Dad could like hit those 120km/h balls i pitched. wow, i thought he was the kind of person with the ever so round tummy, ever so.... okiez, i am lame. LoLz. nothing much, gota sleep. TV was fun loL. familiar with "bACK TO SCHOOL?" yea, that was funny. haha.   Nightz... Muackz  Thought of the day: If that's your limit, do the best out of that limit, and your performance will be beyond that limit
