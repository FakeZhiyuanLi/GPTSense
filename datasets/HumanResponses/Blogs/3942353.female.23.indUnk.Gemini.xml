       So, I decided to join the blogging world. And in my inaugural post I have nothing better to write about than my own personal affairs. So it goes.   I'm 23, with an unsturdy (at best) job, a throbbing and what seems to be an endlessly increasing debt (thanks to student loans), and yes, that's right, I'm still a student... in (it gets better) philosophy. Philosophy... let that sink in a little and you'll soon get the look the "what kind of bohemian ethereal artist without an art kind of life are you going to have with a philosophy degree?!" look--I want to go to law school, I say. Oh, you think, another one of *those*. Yeah, I know. I didn't think they let bohemians into law school, either. But, I'm not really a bohemian, so who cares. I don't think there are too many other ways one person could lack in direction.   And my love life? or what resembles one lies frustrated in the balance. Maybe not so in the balance. Recent discoveries have left my love life breathing through an oxygen tank and in critical condition. That's what I get for toying around with the possibility that an incredibly interesting guy coming off an 8 year relationship could want to start one up again. And in the time honored tradition of Abby's bad luck with guys, it turns out that ex-but-not-really-ex-girlfriend of said interesting guy has resurfaced (surprise... only after 3 months of break-up time) and wants to move out to CA. Well, if it wasn't another ABC After School Special episode if I ever saw one.... Happy Ever Fucking After, Adam.  But, Tuesday night. Tuesday night was just plain bad form. A drive over to some drool-inspiring hot guy's house will do that to a person. Four tall shots of vodka + gin and grapefruit juice (factor in this was all on an empty stomach) = fastest way to InstaHangover. It was bad. I was mildly buzzed, completely skipped being drunk, and went head first into Ickyville.  Enter Cole, stage left.  Cole is... dangerous, and he knows he's dangerous and likes to think that he isn't. A "player" if I ever saw one, he talks about the girls he's dated the same way you would about old pairs of shoes. You remember the attraction you had to them the first time you put them on, some of the good times you may or may not have had while wearing them, and all the reasons why you shoved them under your bed to make room for another pair. What's worse is that he knows what to say to help you excuse or even dismiss all this, knows exactly what to do to get at you, and reels you in willing or otherwise.   The fact that I put up what little resistance I do to him is probably what attracts him to me; that and I indulge him in his board game playing addiction. Yes, this former high school almost college jock, loves board games and not just the Sunday night with the family variety. No. These are board games with entire civilizations constructed, torn down, then built up again. Who knew gamers could be so uber attractive?    Apart from his propensity to be a player (or whatever), his creeping vanity, and his extreme grouchiness in the mornings, he really is quite likeable. And I mean that in the most sincere, non-sarcastic way..... That's what makes him so dangerous. Oh, well. I'll live through this one, too.
