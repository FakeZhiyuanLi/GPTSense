      I READ : because one life isn't enough, and in the pages of a book I can be anybody;   I READ : because the words that build the story become mine, to build my life;   I READ : not for happy endings but for new beginnings; I'm just beginning myself, and I wouldn't mind a map;   I READ : because I have friends who don't and young though they are, they're beginning to run out of materials;   I READ : because every journey begins at the library, and it's time for me to start packing;   I READ : because one of these days I'm going to get out of this town and I'm going to go everywhere and meet everyone, and I want to be ready.

      your body burns 24 calories for every 15 minutes you kiss   kissing is meditative - it can bring your focus to the present moment and help you release tension   various forms of touch (including kissing!) release oxytocin, a hormone that promotes calm and pair bonding

      i'm reading, jane austen, once again   this time around is "persuasion", she speaks to my soul and moves me in a way no other literature has even been capable of, she makes me feel things i can only dream about feeling in my life   ... i've read her countless times, and she has never failed to deliver, not once in my three years of addiction   i should be studying anatomy, ...   enough of punishing myself in this stupid manner, i have to have at least one more chapter to sustain me

      new found respect ... for the insanity of mothers ... i was babysitting today from 8.45am to 3.50pm ... very time consuming, i've never done so much and acomplished so little ... i'm beat!   fighting paola ...  our latest fight ...  i've spared you from reading my replies   ----------------- "quit it with the damn forwards" ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  You can be sooo rude sometimes! In case you didn't notice, it wasn't a fowarded message, it was one that I wrote and that I sent to al my friends wishing a merry freaking christmas and happy new freaking year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't know what's wrong with you, you seem to not like me when I tell you I'm tired and I don't feel like doing shit! If you wanna talk you know how to reach me!  ----------------- Girl, I don't know what is up with you!!! If someone is hormonal, it sure is not me- I'm a bitch all the time, I don't have mood swings (like other people). And by the way... have you told that to Stephanie? you know about 'quit with the forwarded messages!" because I notice she send a bunch all the time and I don't think she is stopping!!! All you have to do most of the time is ask people NICELY (key word) to stop doing something that is annoying you. You don't have to be rude! After a vacation, don't you think you should be relaxed and carefree??? Heck, I would... don't abuse MY patience... love, love  ----------------- Unsocialble? ME??? ha, ha, ha!!! Tha't funny, that's how people referred to you at school. Maybe I have RESPONSIBILITIES, not like others that only care about being a social butterfly. I'm throught with you! You are irresponsible and really don't know how to keep a friendship. I can't deal with inmature little girls, that's why I stopped talking to all of you before, same freaking reason. I tried...you obviously didn't. You only talk to me when you need someone to talk to, not to continue a friendship. Don't have time for this shit!!! You know? I have to work... oops! you don't know exactly what that is!  Love.... PH -----------------   update ...  she called yesterday to invite me to go to her birthday party tonight

      my blog listens like no other friend  my blog doesn't interrupt whilst i talk, it lets me finish my sentences  my blog remembers what i say  my blog doesn't call me in the middle of the night with an identity crisis  my blog doesn't tell on me to mother  my blog knows i'm a good friend  my blog keeps quiet when i need it to do just that  my blog isn't jealous, it lets me share my thoughts with others  my blog is highly addictive   ... i want to post all the time, i want to make blogger friends, i want to have a kewl blog that people want to read, i want to think and do things just so i can write about them here ...   i don't have much to say about anything ... but that doesn't matter, does it?   here is some real good fanfiction for harry potter  http://www.sugarquill.net/

      at this moment, what is your favorite ...   #1 ... song?   it changes, right now it's "just what i do" by trick pony ...   "did he do it for the money? or was it for the fame? finally somebody asked him, jesse, why do you want to rob them trains? and jesse said is just what i do when i can't get no loving, is just what i do when i can't get no loving, i'm the meanest hombre you ever saw 'cause baby i ain't getting no loving at all, is just what i do, is just what i do"   #2 ... food?   i don't know if a smoothie quialifies as food but, i've been a smoothie junkie for a few years now, lately however i seriously can't stop drinking the damn things ... i've tried most of them at "smoothie king" and most of them suck ... my one and only is "strawberry x-treme" ... i'm not big and i can totally finish the large smoothie easily and still go for another round   #3 ... tv show?   i don't watch tv at all ... when i did i had a lot of shows i liked ... i think if i could pick a show to watch again it would be a tie between "charmed" and "will and grace" ... it's like magical vs funny ... hard choice, ain't it?   #4 ... scent?   coconut ... it brings beautiful images to my mind  it smells heavenly & it tastes good  the word coconut almost inspires me to paint what i picture as paradise  a beautiful deserted beach, white sand, blue blue water, a radiant sun, coconut trees giving refreshing shade ... crispy tanned coconut skin, tiny knickers, and sunglasses  ... summer time    #5 ... quote?   "i blame my mother for everythin that is wrong with me and if you knew her, you would too" ... it's by me, it's true, it's funny, it conveys a message, and i wasn't trying   http://www.fridayfive.org

If you wan't no bs convo....write back....if you just want to chat....write back. (and if you just want to flirt...you can write me just because you're soooo darn cute) ^_~

      [a longer list would make me sleep deprived]   ........ FIVE THINGS I REALLY DIG ABOUT YOU  #1 ... your pretty eyes  #2 ... how much you love your dog  #3 ... how you always hold my stuff in your pockets  #4 ... your butt  #5 ... the emails you write me

      #1 ... what does it say in the signature line of your emails?   it reads "-Girl Deal" but i always delete the signature before even i start to write an email, i've been meaning to get rid of "it" [the signature] forever ... i first set it up when i got my email account but i'm too lazy to go and change it back to nothing ... yet i'm somehow not too lazy to write this long winded explanation about it   #2 ... did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? what was it? if you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?   ... no i didn't have a senior quote, i didn't get to be a senior in high school, ... i'll never graduate either because i've moved on to better and bigger things [college] but if i had the chance it probably would have been something highly aggressive even though i can't think of anything good right now   #3 ... if you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? if you already have them, what do they say?   if i had vanity plates ... it would be something cute more than likely, something very self indulgent like, ... PRINCESS or DIVA or CUTIE or QUEEN  ... i feel however that PRINCESS embodies all of the other possibilities so that would probably be my pick   #4 ... have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? what did the inscription say?  thank god i have not received such things, odds say i would've thrown it back in their face whoever it might have been ... except mother of course, i'm afraid of her   #5 ... what would you like your epitaph to be?   epitaph? what's that? ... hold on, got to run to merriam-webster.com be right back ... ok got it, good ... SHE WAS LOVED   http://www.fridayfive.org

      #1 ... are you superstitious?  no, i'm not, i don't believe in the supernatural, i don't think a black cat is unlucky, i don't believe that breaking a mirror will be seven years of bad luck,  or that something bad will happen if i walk under a ladder and if something bad does happen it won't be because i walked under a ladder (however it might be because i was stupid and walked under the wrong ladder, ex. ladder wasn't positioned correctly and fell on my head leaving me twice as slow as i already am)   #2 ... what extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?   there are all kinds of crackheads that will do things that crackheads have been heard to do, i heard of a lady that would put her worn panties to stew in the food she fed her husband so he would be "tied" to her and have no eyes for anyone else (YUCK!)   superstitious people tend to be stupid, they follow advice from "gifted" ones blindly, sometimes things turn out okay and the advisors are praised, sometimes things turn out wrong and people say "well, the stars weren't in place" or cryptic crap like that, which proves how nuts they are   #3 ... believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?  i don't know many of them, but a simple one will do, something like "if a spoon/broom falls visitors are coming", people never let me know they're coming, so that would be useful   #4 ... do you believe in luck? if yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?   no i don't believe in luck, luck is the outcome of your decisions, you make a good choice you get something good, call it luck if you will, i prefer to call it wisdom, hard work, reason   #5 ... do you believe in astrology? why or why not?   i do not, the reason is that i don't believe in things that can't be proved fallible, you look at the stars  and the stars "tell you" (who deciphered the code if you please?) that something good will come your way, you have a crappy day, on your way home you miss a stop sign and you don't get a ticket or hit by another vehicle, is that it? or say that you run a light, and a cop sees you but he's feeling lazy so he doesn't give you a ticket, you don't even realize that a cop was there, is that it? even if you don't have the full picture?   now when the stars "say" for example "that the one you desire wants you to" or something along those lines and it happens then it happened "the stars were right", when it doesn't YOUR cosmic energy wasn't appropiate or it WOULD'VE happened but YOU had to ask (the stars didn't tell you that, they have a funny way of forgeting tidbits like that)

      #1 ... what's the most daring thing you've ever done?  i'm not sure i want to tell you that, but one of the less bit shocking most daring things is cutting my hair, allow me to explain, i'm 22 and i had never cut my hair before beyond a simple trim, two days ago (tired of it getting caught in car doors, doors in general, keys, and other odd places) i went into my bathroom and chopped more than half of it off myself, it used to be almost two feet long   #2 ... what one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?  oh well, my mother doesn't approve of ANYTHING i do, everything is too "this" or "that", my friends don't really care about me because they don't even care about themselves so i doubt they would object to anything i did, except perhaps to upset me, there are however a few people that are care (some more than others) about me and what i do ... i think the one thing could be either hang gliding in new zeland or getting a tattoo   #3 ... on a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)  i'd say for my public life it would be 5, privately 9.3   #4 ... what's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?  i don't know, too many good things have happened as a result of a bold action   #5 ... and what's the worst?  i don't know that i want to talk about the worst thing ... i don't think there have been too many bad things, but i can't recall at present

      is little ...  my thoughts, the intense love i feel for those whom i would love, the sorrow i remember to have lived, the laughter that echoes far at the bottom of moments blessed with happiness, the gentle and soft touch of sun kissed memories that won't fade even when i wish they would, the proud look on my father's face when he sees not what he expected but his daughter still, the rememberance of the tenderness of the souls that love & keep me, ...   i am surrounded by these from north, south, west, & east ...  but most of all by hope ...  the hope to see those faces again, to live once more such happiness, to give back to those that gave me and give me still ...  bitter sweet hope ...  kiss me one more time ...  kiss me good night ...

      if for only an instant God would forget that i'm only a rag doll and gave me life, i possibly wouldn't say everything i think, but i would definitely think everything i say   i would value things, not for what they're worth, but for what they mean   i would sleep little, dream more, i understand that for every minute that i close my eyes, i lose sixty seconds of light   i would go on when the others stop, i would wake when the rest sleep ... i would listen when the others talk, and how would i enjoy a good chocolate ice cream cone   if God granted me life, i would dress simple, i would lie under the sun, baring not only my body but my soul   my God, if i had a heart, i would write my hate on ice, and wait for the sun to come up ... i would paint with the dreams of van gogh on the stars a poem by benedetti, and a song by serrat would be the serenade that i would offer to the moon   i would water roses with my tears, so i could feel the pain of their thorns, and the sweet and subtle kiss of their petals ...   my God, if i lived ... i wouldn't let a single day go by without telling those i love that i love them   i would convince every man and woman that they are my favorites, and i would be in love with love himself   i would prove to men how wrong they are to think that they stop falling in love when they grow old, without ever knowing that they grow old when they stop falling in love   to a boy i would give wings, but i would let him learn to fly on his own, ... to the old i would teach that death doesn't come with age but with forget   so many things i've learned   i've learned that everybody wants to live on top of the mountain, without knowing that true felicity is in the way one climbs said mountain   i've learned that when a newborn hangs on to his father's finger with his little hand for the first time ... he has him forever   i've learned that a man can only look at an other man down, when he would help him get up

      time is unforgiving like nothing and no one else ... it's running away from us all like never before, i wonder where it's going, i wonder if it has a home, i wonder if it's a guy or a girl or maybe a homo ... what is it doing? why is it in such a hurry?   all i know is that it's leaving us behind, the real us, the young & wild, and it's only taking with it the shadow of what we once were ... want proof? we're not getting any younger, are we now?   i miss me, i miss all the days that are gone, i miss the days i wasted & the days i truly lived ... i miss them all, they're mine or they were mine, why should they be taken away? ... big sentimentalist that i am, tears rolling down my cheeks, i'm mourning the days gone, the days that won't come back   i'm not unhappy, that's not why i'm lamenting the constant and consistent loss of youth, it's because i am happy and i don't want it to end that i miss them and wish i could hang on to them ... even the wasted days were wasted wonderfully, being young and wild and many times blissfully stupid   you should remember your young days too, you'll need them one day, if anything to say that you were once young too ...   none will believe you, none could believe you by looking at your worn out face, and wrinkly skin, those fingers that shake to the smalles efforts now, those fingers that were once instruments of the precise ...   none will believe you because by looking at you it seems impossible that you were ever young, that you ever knew what it was to be full of life and hope, because you aren't now ... and then maybe, just maybe someone will believe you and they will think to hold on to their own young days ... but they won't be able to either, just like you, just like me

      FREE WILL   I don’t believe in free will.  I don’t believe humans are free to do or not do according to their own will.   Even fulfilling our most simple desires can prove challenging on some occasions, for example something that should be fairly simple like getting to class on time.   So you’re ready to go to school, you’ve had a shower to cleanse you of the nasty cigarettes stench from other club goers from last night and that beer-smelling sweat from all the booze you imbibed. You’re ready, even though you have a nerve-wrecking migraine from the hangover and you rather be run over by the AMTRAC, you are ready.  Oh yeah, let’s not forget, you are ready and you have sixty minutes before class starts. You have plenty of time, or so you think after all it’s only a 15-minute drive, 5 lousy miles to campus. But you’re wrong. You don’t even have enough time to call God and ask mercy from all that is about to befall you.   (Deduct the minutes you think these problems would take an imperfect human being to resolve instead of the minutes it would take your perfect self to solve and even leave room for improvement.)   First you go to the gas station and there is literally a traffic jam at the gas pumps (that lady in the Volvo almost hit you, b*tch), next the damn Indian (from India) clerk thinks he’s so hot with his thick annoying accent and the purple skin around his eyes (which brings only one thing to my mind; CRAZY RACCOON, RUN!!) that he’s actually starting to flirt with you (it’s 8.10am for Christ sakes!) and to try and touch your hand whilst he pretends to give you the right amount of cash back (it is of course less than it ought to be, because if somebody didn’t try to cheat you out of your cash, well, it would just not be a day in YOUR life, it’d be some lucky stranger in Canada). The adventure continues and next up you have ahead of you thirty red lights, … “But there’s only 12 traffic lights from here to school, what the?” … yeah, well that’s in the past smart-pant-traffic-light-counting-dude, now there are thirty, and for you they are all red. As if that wasn’t enough, one of them is broken, so it isn’t actually red, it’s more of a stop sign at a very busy intersection (how convenient NOT), the stupid-motherless children from hell are running as if Barney was signing autographs for free all over the school zone which means that instead of going 20 mph like you’re supposed to (even though you weren’t really planning to) you’re going like 3 or 4 mph if you’re lucky. We’re past that, you think you can breath again, you’re only three lights away from entering the campus’ parking lot. You didn’t count however on the crazy Aunt Jemima exiting the McDonalds at the corner and almost hitting you which was nonetheless a rush, or the motorcycle guy thinking that he’s some of REAL racer, because if he was he wouldn’t be racing in the street but in one of those God forsaken designated places to race instead of the freaking streets of Dallas! Oh yeah, there is the lady with the Volvo exciting the BankOne, hmm, if you only had a gun. Well so it’s not the same lady but you are quite sure it could be from the stupidity she displays while attempting something so simple as going from a parking lot into a street lane without killing somebody, or maybe, she did want to kill someone. So it’s now 8.50am and you’re looking for a parking space, all the good ones are taken. Finally heartbroken almost you take the one lonely place in lot Z and start the two-mile walk to the classroom. You get there and your teacher shoots you the nastiest look in his arsenal and says with a squeaky voice “You’re late Ms. Cordoba”.   Point taken?  If I could exercise my free will, none of that would have happened or would ever happen again. There is no free will.

      i'm bored  i should be studying but instead i'm doing nothing  i want to get a job, i'm tired of being broke  i want to make good grades, i need to study more  i need to start really paying off my student loans, i need a job  i need/want to get a car, i need a job  i want to ebay/amazon sell everything i own that i can sell, i'm tired of losing it to other people  i don't know  i just really want to get a job, so that i can start doing again the things i want to do, how i want to do them, i've never considered work pleasant but it is very liberating, gives you the financial independence that at least "i" need since i have no one to look after but myself  i want to move out, have my own apartment, i need a job  my brothers/roomates are my brothers and all but i'm really tired of them, i need to live on my own as soon as i can afford to move out  i don't want stinking roomates either, i like to be alone   screw this, i'm going to go study  start doing and stop thinking about things  maybe that'll get me somewhere

      what was...  #1 ...your first grade teacher's name?  i don't know, i can't remember, it was something like laura i think, all the same it's unimportant, she was evil and doesn't deserve to be remembered by me, she tried to hit me with a ruler a few times, luckly supermom (that is my mother) was there to save the day, i very narrowly escaped  #2 ...your favorite saturday morning cartoon? it was a combination, there was tv show that had a really funny clown, and they showed "knights of the zodiac", "mazinger z", "thundercats", and they also had drawing and story writing contests, they had more stuff as well but i can't remember it all   #3 ...the name of your very first best friend? juana teresa aguilar ramos aka "juanita"   #4 ...your favorite breakfast cereal? i don't think i ate much cereal when i was little but the ones i liked (liked as in the past and no more) were the one with the stupid tiger with the bandand around his neck, and the chocolate covered rice   #5 ...your favorite thing to do after school? watch another clown/cartoon/contest weekday show, the one on the weekends was a different one, the one during the weekdays was my favorite out of the two, the cartoon episodes were longer, and it had more fun stuff to do, like they would act out (in proper sets and costumes) the winning stories from the writing contests

      everyone likes to believe they are special  the next best thing that happened since sliced bread  everyone is proud of this one or this other little thing that makes them quirky in a special way, sets them apart  some proud themselves on it  some pretend that they don't even know they have it   you are not special or different or superior or smarter or cuter than everyone else out there, you might be more so than some other people but not quite everyone   you are not,i am not, nobody is  so leave it alone

      memorial day, barbecue day   ben said that one of his friends highly disliked TROY and that surprisigly enough he had a pretty good reason for it   (the reason, as best as i can recall it);   "it was because from now on (as long as a blasted copy of it is around) whenever someone needs/wants to learn about homer/the illiad they'll watch the stupid movie and be misled since the scriptwriter seemed to have gone on a rampage (the object of which as i understand it, to be as innacurate as humanly possibly, he was pretty damn successful if you ask me)"  now, one bean at a time   homer WAS a poetry-writing-fag (to each his own)   (side note: there are a lot of fag lovers out there that pay a great deal of money for old editions of the illiad and other queer books, too much money to burn, too much cock lovin' if you ask me)   now if someone did want/need to learn about the fruitcake and the book, i guarantee they WILL pick up the book and read it (a lot of excruciating page turning), chances are they'll probably also get around to watching the flick, depending on their character they could (a) enjoy it and laugh it off or (b) be a tight-shittin' ass and bash it (now they COULD, enjoy it, laugh it off, and then bash it just for the heck of it)   now if someone wanted to fuck around and pretend they want/need to learn about homie/the illiad they'll go and watch the movie and make like they read the book and they're ALL ABOUT that shit   now about the screenwriter (whatever his name is, i forget), he's probably an ignorant stupid ass, a smart stupid ass that did his job and i'm sure was throughly compensated for the painful and grimm task that was to chop up the centenary book (i would've done it AND i would've and been grateful)   now about that ben's friend, the dude that didn't like the movie, he's a fag   if you're gonna be a hater that's fine, but if you're gonna hate somethin' hate it 'cause you can, hate it 'cause you want to, hate it 'cause you didn't get anything from it, hate it 'cause you're a fag or a nigger and everybody else hates you, hate it 'cause you have the right to (or so the constitution says) but don't pretend to hate 'cause you care about "the people" that will be misled and because big-bad-hollywood destroyed the illiad with their cheap-ass-hunk-filled adaptation, they didn't destroy anything, they made an adaptation that doesn't and can't replace the original, don't pretend that because if you do, i have to tell you that you're a fag and not only that but a lying-fag 'cause you don't even know what you're talking about, chances are you ain't read that book and if you have, you probably didn't get it anyway   now i'm a serial movie watcher  i watch just about every movie that comes to a cineplex near me (sometimes far from me), i don't have a formed opinion about TROY, however i do know that they, the makers, achieved what they wanted, a big hit anda lot of money from it, i on the other hand achieved something i wanted and something i didn't, first i had SOMETHING to do for that span of time and second i WASTED useful time that might've been profitably spent on better things (or maybe not)   night sissies

      at the movies  what was the first movie you saw alone? dunno, might've been jurassic park, it was a loooonnnnngggg time ago   who was the last person you took to a movie? what movie did you watch? took? i didn't take anybody, my boyfriend took me to yesterday's midnight show of "the day after tomorrow", but if we had to go back in time and think of me taking anybody i think the last person was my mom, i took her to see "scary movie", she hated it   where do you usually like to seat? in the very center, center row, the center of the center row, otherwise i throw a fit   how do you get your tickets; at the box-office, at the automated box-office, or online? again, i don't really get tickets anymore, my boyfriend takes care of that, but when i did or when i do it's most likely at the box-office   do you eat at the movies? if so, what? i don't like to eat at the movies, it distracts me from the movie, if i wanted to eat i'd go to a restaurant instead of the movies, but i do however end up eating there against my better judgement, usually popcorn and coke but i'm terribly partial to hot-dogs

      no such thing, they all suck   yesterday, sunday, yes that was yesterday for those of you with short term memory, i went down to borders books to look for something to spend the $20 gift card that i got on my birthday friday, yes that's two days before sunday   i happen to own a very good filmmaking book by rick shmidt  urlLink  feature filmmaking at used-car prices: how to write, produce, direct, shoot, edit, and promote a feature-lenght movie for less than $15,000  which tackles both creative and technical aspects of filmmaking and  urlLink  the elements of screenwriting by irwin r blacker  (former USC teacher, he's been dead for a while) which is all you need in my opinion to put together a quality low-budget film together   alas, the above is not exactly true, those books are all you need regarding books, putting a good film together, that's a different story   the books i found at borders to say the least were useful door stops  the best of the worst :  urlLink $30 film school  and  urlLink make your own damn movie    i wouldn't take either of them home if they gave them to me for free, i have too much junk as it is   on a happier note   urlLink extreme dv at used-car prices: how to write, direct, shoot, edit, and produce a digital video feature for less than $3000 by rick schmidt  is coming out july 27 and is ready for online pre-ordering for less than $12 at amazon.com and borders.com   so depressed from many hours of book-browsing i came home, with guess what?, an intact $20 borders gift card =0(

      11 days, 23 hours to harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  i don't like to think of myself as a groupie or a fan of anything or anybody, the idea of being a follower makes me want to puke my guts out, even if i have to self-induce  i really need to get a life, wait, i ... i have a life, but no wait, i think i'm a groupie, yuck! ... a harry potter groupie non-the-less  PUKING PAUSE  i'm exasperated now ...  i was thinking about going to the midnight premier but i hate kids and it'll probably be crawling with them, i think i'll wait  i better go to sleep before i puke again

      it was friday the 21st, it was a very good day  i had a lot of fun, my boyfriend got me a really cool fossil watch and pink converse  he planned on taking me out to a fancy dinner but ... i'm a lame joe, i wasn't hungry at the time of the reservation  we ended up going bungee jumping, i was terrified, it was ..., well if i was any younger i'd pee my pants, my bf jumped on his own, the manager had to push me and i screamed bloody murder for the first time in a long time  i'm not the kind to get easily scared but once you're up there, it seems different, i kept telling myself ..."of all the things i wanted to do on my b-day, dying wasn't one of them"  i'm going to do it again, this time i want to jump on my own  we ended up eating low-carb pizza & a surprise chocolate cake they had at our friends house to culminate with "man on fire" (good movie ****)   thank you to all those who remembered

      today i went to movie trading company to sell some movies on videotape i still had, i didn't want them anymore, they took up too much space   accidentally i ran a red light, the black suburban coming at me stopped i daresay two inches away from my bumper, not because they couldn't brake in time, just one of those aggressive drivers   turns out the black suburban was going to movie trading company to sell videotapes as well, when i got out of my car, the driver of the suburban did too, she had three children in tow, she started screaming her head off at me, i was about to apologize for cutting her off, i didn't after that, i was getting red hot with anger at that point but i didn't say anything since she had small children and all, i went in the store and got in line   as she came in she was bitching and cussing and being a one woman show, she told her children "if she hadn't cut us off at the light, we would be first", one of her children of about 5 years of age said  she should've gotten a ticket mommy, she's a bitch", several people turned around at this remark and so did i   "contain yourself and your child before i stab both your hearts out"   she started walking toward the exit door saying she was dialing the police on her cell phone, to which i said   "i was reconsidering stabbing you since i'm in a hurry, but now i really think i'm going to"

        i try to read your blog everyday, usually when i'm at school in the lab, i can't believe you liked the catcher in the rye, i didn't like it at all, i got through it and i appreciated the underlying meanings just not my type    catcher in the rye is one of my favorite books, to be precise, my second favorite book   I feel the way Holden does about a lot of things and about a lot of people, I have a severe dislike for crummy-ness, I hate fakes but unlike Holden I take delight in them, and my mother would kill me if she ever found out I talk about her and her relationship with my father openly and without holding back, my way of thinking resembles very much his writing style, I share the points of view, wrong as people might think them to be, they seemed very right to me,...   thank you for reading my blog, i read yours too ;0p

      Yes, the superstore.   I went there a few days ago, not really with the intention of buying anything, just browsing.  I like looking at toys and stuff.   Finally I remembered that I needed a coffee mug, indispensable to keep awake in my morning classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. My teacher has one, he's my role model at the moment, I must have one.   I didn't like any of the ones they had at Target except for a rather primitive looking one, it wasn't cool enough, it wasn't original enough, it wasn't ME enough.   In the mean time I looked at the toys and invariable as it always is, I ended up being royally humiliated, I tried to Hoola Hoop ...  I shouldn't have.   Anyway, after that I decided to conquer the mug issue, I ended up going to Barnes And Noble where I found the perfect/dream mug, but indecisive as I am I went to borders where I bought a pretty red mug for my boyfriend, then i took the trip back to barnes and noble where i obtained the fair 18oz copper chubby mug that is now my new baby.

      Most women tip-toe while potty-ing, most men don't. It's a matter of observation, don't ask.  For scientific purposes I decided to try potty-ing feet flat on the floor, it's terribly uncomfortable. However my legs didn't go to sleep, when I tip-toe they usually do and getting up turns into a real bitch. I also tried potty-ing sitting straight up, boy was that a bastard! Take my word for it, it was.

       "But not fighting does not always equal a loss. Sometimes that is what is needed. Must take it moment by moment. Don't push me, cuz I'm close to the edge." Chris,  I was not made to sit still and do nothing. If others can idly watch while the shit hits the fan, goody, but I can't, I won't. I don't agree with that defeatist behavior and I won't ever think it's an acceptable course of "action". I respect those who choose to sit back and "see" how it turns out. I think individuals are entitled to execute their God-given free will. But just because I respect that someone's a moron and let them be in peace doesn't mean I think they're right. It just means that I want the same respect from them, I want them to leave me be in peace. In my experience getting off your arse is half the battle, unfortunately the mentality of sitting still and waiting for divine interference prevails.

      .... is just a Beatles song. Fuck that, I say FIGHT!  You gotta fight to the death for what you want, if you really want it and you're not just fucking around moping pretending you do when all you really care about is the next re-run of Friends and the potato chip bag keeping you company.  Be it love, be it war you gotta fight because if you don't, you're a moron and a wimp. Fighting doesn't guarantee you'll win but it guarantees a shot at winning, that's a good start.  What if the difference between winning and losing is getting off your arse, putting on the gloves and standing your ground? It's seldom that easy, but sometimes truth be told, you don't even have to throw a punch, if you do, don't hold back.  I often hear people say "if it happens, then it was meant to happen" or some bullshit along those lines. They're losers and don't listen to them, most of them have given up without a fight too many times or think you're a loser that doesn't have the minerals to get shitfaced and fight for yourself.   "If it happens, then it was meant to happen". Not if I can help it, not if it's up to me, not if I can have my way, and definately not without a fight. I'll be  damned  before I throw in the towel without some sweat and blood on it.

      Not because I don't know multiple syllable words to insult you with.  Not because I'm undereducated.  Not because I'm vulgar.  Not because I'm poor.  Not because others do it and influence me.  Not because I saw it in a move and thought it was fucking groovy or stylish.  I do it because I can, because I want to, because I'm free, because I live in a wonderful country where free speech is one of my rights and duties. I do it simply because it's the way I naturally express myself sometimes.  Don't give me shit about it.

      things have improved since friday, i feel better and even though my hair is much shorter than i originally wanted it to be i'm getting used to it, my guy &amp; my brothers love it so i've got moral support, i'm okay     saturday my boyfriend took me out to  urlLink the pocket sandwich theater  (which turned out to be in my zipcode area) to see a show called "Captain Blood"     we arrived a little early so we decided to pop in the comic shop next door to the theater and ran into some of my beau's friends (weird! we thought they might be going to the show too, but they headed home), i didn't even know there was a comic shop there and so near my home, now i'll be a regular     we went on to the theater, it is a little but very lovely venue filled with old pictures and interesting artifacts, it was filling up quickly and before we knew it, it was absolutely packed, the play was splendid, the actors were very good and when they weren't we threw popcorn at them! you gotta watch out though, they're very sensitive and they throw it back at you, we both ordered beef nachos (they gave us big &amp; tasty portions), we laughed our butts off, and i took a zillion pictures, you can see some of them  urlLink HERE        this is my boyfriend and me at the pocket sandwich theater, our waiter took this picture

      friday i left dallas with trish for denison, her hometown, where through a friend of hers she had found the fabulous hairstylist responsible for her new do, i'd been wanting to cut my hair short for a good while now, my own hairstylist (whom i trust completely even though she never does what i tell her to do) unfortunately is been having a mental crisis for a good couple of months now, i'm starting to think she's not coming out of it     anyway, i met the hair miracle maker who had given trish such pretty "flippies" as trish calls them, i liked her, she went on to fix my friend's hair, and then proceded to give me the most terrible haircut in the entire universe, she made me look like my cousin (who used to cut her hair with the help of the vaccum cleaner), i almost passed out, i almost puked, i almost beat her up (trish knowing my temper, how picky i am, and that she wanted to come back to chris -the bitch with the scissors- had asked me to be "on my best behavior), i was as ... civilized as i could under the stressful circumstances     .... i called my brother, i wanted to shave my head and wanted to know how bad of an idea he thought it would be, he said "baby, i'll fix it, i'll fix it, or i'll have someone fix it for you, don't do anything until i see you" ... when he saw me i could see in his eyes the real degree of the damage, then he smiled and said "you still have enough hair for me to fix it, don't worry" and fix it he did

       have you ever consulted a fortune teller?   i'm not a good christian and i know it, if you read my blog you know it too, i do a lot of things that offend God, but THIS is not one of them     do you believe in premonitions? have you ever had one?   nope and nope ... my mum pretends that she has them, she's always calling saying that she's "just sure" i'll be run over by a locomotive, during the september 11 attacks she was sure that the next building to be bombarded would be my school, it wasn't, i think she does it to have an excuse to call, for conversation's sake, she should know better, she doesn't need an excuse to call me     have you ever had deja vu?   i thought i had deja vu a couple of times, turns out i was just too drunk to remember that i HAD actually been there and/or done that before     do you believe in the power of the mind?   yes, absolutely, anything is possible, it has limitations i'm sure but i don't know what they are    do you believe in first impressions and "following your heart"?     no and no     a first impression is just that, i'm not about to canonize neither proscribe anyone upon meeting them, i'd be naive to do so, i'm not naive     my heart, my heart is stubborn much like myself, sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it wants chocolate when it knows i'm allergic to it, i wouldn't rely on my heart to do the right thing

      you scored 25% Artemis   if you are ruled by Artemis, your independent spirit belongs to no one but yourself, your body is vibrant, your attitude robust and your manner vigorous and alive, you are driven by physical rather than mental energy, you feel complete without a man in your life and would never compromise your essential nature for a romantic partner, you are skilled at establishing personal boundaries and enter into relationships on your own terms -- in short, you can take care of yourself, this attitude may at times put men off, but if what you're looking for is an equal, loving relationship, take some tips from Hera   i didn't cheat on  this  test by the way, i AM t  his cool =0p

       how do you relax?   i don't much, but i like watching movies in bed with my boyfriend    how many hours do you usually sleep?   i like to sleep a lot, it doesn't matter if i'm tired or not, i want to sleep, i think i inherited from my old dad, he says it keeps you young, i believe him, usually i wake up in the mornings when my boyfriend leaves, i rollover and land his spot and fall right back asleep, i can keep doing that for as long as i want to, there was one summer when i would go to bed at 10pm and wake up at 3pm the next day everyday, everyone thought i was senile and energy deprived, i don't think i aged one day that year     do you have trouble sleeping?   yes, i can't sleep if ...        my boyfriend isn't with me          i'm hot          i'm upset          i ate too much before bed          i take a shower          don't have a warm enough blanky         if you team up two or more of these i go mad     do you have a favorite sleeping position?    yes i do, either my boyfriend hugging me or me hugging him while i rest my head on his arm, lately we've been sleeping diagonally on the bed just for the sake of it, it's pretty comfortable    where is the weirdest place you've slept?  nowhere weird really

      saturday morning my boyfriend took me to the sci-fi expo, it was a lot of fun, there we met with a lot of friends, mostly my guy's     i got a volume1 and a t-shirt of "dead@17" (i'm totally addicted to this comic, after buying the trade paper back and the shirt i got a free poster signed by the creator, a free postcard and a free sticker), &amp; a gundam model kit (which i have yet to assemble)     that night trish, nick, and i went salsa dancing, it was such a hassle, we were sucked into thinking that the club we wanted to go to really enforced the dress code, they didn't and they also didn't play much salsa, but it was all worth it because we had a lot of fun, we danced for a long long time, we were sweaty, tired, satisfied and hungry when we left, we went straight for breakfast, yummy ...     sunday i was blasted until late noon, we saw "home on the range" at the dollar theater, i hate children and it was packed with the little criters, we sat all the way in the back to avoid as many of them as we could, my boyfriend's chair didn't have a cup holder so he put down his diet coke on the floor and this kid just came, picked it up and started to drink, by the time my guy realized it, it was too late, the nasty parent just put down the coke where it was and walked away without apology ...     i spent monday being sleepy but trying to work on 3ds max, i talked to mother and i tried to go to sleep early but failed     today i feel very tired again, all i can think of is sleep, all i want is to sleep, i missed my morning self-defense class because i didn't have clean work-out clothes, i should do laundry, i have class tonight too, i woudln't want to miss it AGAIN

      like a complete idiot, like someone kicked the shit out of me, like i'm ready to pack up and leave, like hope is only a word, like i should know when to quit and i don't, like i lost my anti-drug, like i've lied to myself, like being bitch again is alright, like a phone that don't ring, like ice cream at 90 degrees, like there's nowhere to hide

      it's the early morning hours, seems like dusk even though i know it's probably later than that, i'm in my room, sleeping in my bed, half covered with blankets, one arm one leg hanging off the bed like always, and my boyfriend is there, he's saying good-bye, i try to wake up but he tells me it's okay, "go back to sleep" and i don't want to, i want to wake up, i'm trying to wake up so hard but i can't, he's kissing me good-bye, he's getting ready to leave, i know, all i can see is the silhouette of him walking to the door, leaving, i can only manage a frail "i love you" god knows i do, he tells me he loves me too, i'm soo sad, it's agonizing to see him walk out, i'm trying to wake up, all i can feel is this terrible dispair, i'm starting to cry, i can feel my eyes watering and the tears bursting out while i fight to hold them back, i don't want to cry, i want to hold him, i want to tell him i love him, i want to wake up but i can't     i couldn't, this morning has been the worst morning i've ever had

      Q: What got you interested in making films? A: Watching John Wayne midnight movies with my dad. I think I hold on to that. He was a major John Wayne fan but an avid and knowledgeable film buff overall. I feel as if I'm trying to engage his attention, if he were ever to watch something I made and didn't fall asleep or walked out, I'd be proud.  Q: How did you meet your boyfriend? A: Through a school friend. We went out for a bit and it didn't work, two years later I got in touch with him, we tried it again and here we are eight months later.  Q: Why is it good to be a woman? A: I don't know, why is it? I hate PMS, I've mood swings, depression, I'm a binge eater, I'm rash, emotional, self concious of my body, and I have food allergies that result in bad skin. If I was a man, no woman would date me, I'd be too much of a girl. I like looking at my tits on the mirror and playing with them, when I sleep I tuck my hand under my shirt and keep it between them, it's very soft and warm. I think that's the best bit.  Q: Are you a religious person? A: I wish I was. I'm too much of a moron though. I know quite a bit about religion actually but I emphasize of doing the exact opposite of what is right, it makes it hard to try and be Christ-like. I have the will power to be, I know, but I just feel soo weak.  Q: What country would you love to visit and why? A: England. I don't know, I'm not sure. I've romantiziced the place I think. I love Jane Austen's work, Harry Potter, the legends of Kings and Knights like Arthur and his round table, I'm facinated by castles and mannors, I'd like to take a tour of Buckingham Palace,  see Manchester United play, I think the English accent is lovely second alone to the Mexican accent, I'm a devoted fan of Shakespeare and Wilde plays, and I'm a great fan of John Hannah, Hugh Grant, and Beckham.

      July 22nd  Q: What do you think about poetry? A: I don't like it. Some people have insinuated or flat out told me that I'm ignorant and devoid of taste. I might be, I haven't completely put it out of the question. I just don't see anything brilliant about it, I don't feel touched or moved or connected or understood or whatever it is people say they feel when they read poetry. Do lyrics qualify as poetry? I think they should, I'd like some if they did. Mostly I think poetry is for fags, old sigle women, and dashing English professors.  Q: Have you ever memorized a poem to recite to someone? A: No.  Q: Have you ever written or tried to write poetry? A: In my own way, yes. (See post #1) I think simple words can be beautiful, I think fancy words are made to appear beautiful, I think what you do is more important than anything you have to say.  Q: Who's your favorite poet? A: I don't like poetry so I wouldn't have a favorite poet. However, I have read Edgar Allan Poe & DH Lawrence. It's a tie I think.  Q: What's your favorite poem and why? A: Self-pity by DH Lawrence, I like its simplicity.  July 29th  Q: What does "family" mean to you? Do you belong to one? A: Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten. I don't know what "family" means anymore. I love what little is left of the family I once had. I want them to be happy. They suffocate me at times. I love them soo much and I feel that if we're going to live in the same continent we need a bigger one. Yes, I belong to a family. It's little and broken but still good.  Q: Family member you get along with the best? Why? A: My brother Jonathan. Because all of the things he is to me; father figure, best friend, nemesis, ultimate foe, protector, cell mate, savior, hero, inspiration, worst fears, little brother, ultimately my blood.  Q: Family member you'd like to feed to wild dogs? Have a good reason? A: Everyone else. I have good reasons, plenty of them as a matter of fact. I just don't have wild dogs.  Q: Do you include your steady in your family? Are you part of his? A: Yes I do. No I'm not.  Q: Do you believe that "somebody's" gotta wear the pants in the family? A: Yes, me.
