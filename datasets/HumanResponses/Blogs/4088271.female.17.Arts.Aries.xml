      Yay!!! I finally finished my new song!!! Well had a super tiring day and a super blessed dinner at Swensons just now wit family .. So when i was back at about 10+pm already was too exhausted to study and do anything else . Felt this obligation to just start something for the song , and trully it was all God's grace ... I took up this challenge from my youth guitarist to write a fast number instead of slow ones . Usually slow tunes just hum in my head all the time .... so they come and go easily though , but fast is a little teeny weeny more challenging to write . So yah , just started hitting my organ keys and some tunes came out , it blended , tried to get the key , kinda jazzy but "no , i'm not genius who knows how to write jazz songs!" . So it only sounds like one but not using jazz chords . Ok anyway , was too sleepy to think of any lyrics when i got the whole song done , but decided to flip the bible to Psalm 105 and there was it . God's word for the song and so extracted a little from there and the lyrics just poured out naturally and unusually .. i was actually playing the song with my eyes all closed coz was really reallly very sleepy (now can hardly keep them open too!). So the song now is complete , but then again i dunno what the tittle should be , Psalm 105? or "I'm In Love With You" , or ??? I shall think later . Ok yeah thank god for the never ending inspiration from Him! Amen!!!

       I didn't had a good day in school today , with the gastric and headache plus not studying makes things worse .... Plus this darn teacher who made my day even worst ... so just wanted to calm myself down and sat on the table outside my class to stare at those beautiful trees across the Bukit Nanas .(hehhe i even named some of them!) Florence is getting prettier everyday though , and Skinny has real huge leaves ... Ok anyway , I'm not such of a nature lover but i do love to look at them every morning especially from my seat in class . I took a couple of minutes to absorb those green nature and was inspired to write a song on God's creation though . Some words came out with what sounded more like a pre-chorus or a bridge of a song , but somehow i haven't decided how it would be like . It's like , how often do you see trees and forest in the heart of the city?? In Malaysia itself ,in KL itself , it's so hard to get clear water and clear skies ... Even the stars and moon at night resembles the universe and the Bigness and significance of God ... Sometimes we just tend to forget how Big our GOD is and lovely His creation is ... Ok enough of my lecture , then i don't think it's a coincident that now out of so many days (ok 3 is a hit for me lately) for not coming online that i read this article about "created in wisdom" .. you'd know further when u click on my "Thought 4 Today" . It just expresses exactly what i was thinking ... So ok my point is , God has been talking to me lately directly or indirectly but I will definitely write a song about this and continue to be inspired by the Lord! So THANKS GOD! muaaxx... ok late now , shall go through my usual hours at my organ when i'm free to write this song while i K.I.V it first. Better sleep!=)

      I wanted to post this a couple of days ago but since i fell sick AGAIN on sunday evening , so things hasn't been pleasing to me lately. Anyways , i came across this funny incident (at least i thought it was!) on Sunday evening after my organ class , when i was yam cha-ing with my mum at my favourite mamak near my house . As usual , we were chatting and the mamak environment with silence was broken when this unusual and weird loud noise .. ok it wasn't noise til i found out it was actually this song , how to say .. like those Buddhist prayers (or mantera they call it) that this chinese guy who sitting across my table ... he brought his radio and play those stuffs really like really really loud that it caught everyone's attention and made it a little irritating after awhile . My mum complained it to be so noisy that she asked the mamak fella to tegur that man . I was watching the conversation , to my surprise this chinese man scolded the poor mamak guy and if i'm not mistaken i saw his lip saying "eiish jangan bising la .. you tau apa?!!" then dunno what blah blah then i saw this word "gereja" come out ... and i didn't bother to look at him , coz i thought it was rude . The best part was this man was smoking and secara selamba he just on that radio at a super loud volume . I mean , what i'm trying to say here is that .. wow .. isn't that strange , i mean . He's trying to do good in a way to let everyone know bout Buddhism and his religion , but the other hand he was scolding this mamak fella rudely and smoking and saying things roughly . Sigh ... what has the world turned into , they need the real God seriously ... I've come across these funny incidents , but i thought this was kinda weird though .... something to ponder about?? our society today?

       Hmm .. it's been some days since i blog in . Anyway , yesterday went to FGA for this interschool CF rally thingey , with the presence of the NZ band FORM . I must say their songs are good especially the slow ones . God Of Wonders really touched me though . Anyway , can anyone deny the truth of "power of influence"? I must thank God for saving souls on that day . Trully many were touched if not blessed , because of the message the band leader testified bout his life. Anyway to cut the story short , i'm encouraged and happy to see one my friend received the joy of salvation ... i mean , i dunno what exactly happened coz i wasn't there to be accompanying her , but i trust that at least the holy ghost touched her and god was real to her. Anyway , this was all because of a friend . A friend that followed up on her , cared and continue to minister to her. Imagine so many of us being one of those lost sheeps in the woods . Even myself , was ministered to by my sister . And if today i dun have Jesus , i really dunno what's turned into my life . Sometimes we waver away , stray away from our focus , and drop off the line , but then He'll always bring me back to where i'm meant to be . At our worse times , i seriously can tell everyone even if u dun believe the presence of an ant is created by God , that He'll always be my comforter . Again i read this devotion article from somewhere that talks bout the chain .. the link of chains that we as Christians form ... taking our jobs to help God save souls . It's so true ... strucked my head - that without these peoples' influence , how will we get to know who God is? I've always remembered what Pas Chris Long said during APYAC last year about "The Power Of One" , now i'm re-phrasing it to the Power Of Influence-how true isn't it?

      Time seem to pass super fast and like those chinese proverb goes "charm ha ngan , si kan ko cho la" .. in other words , in a blink of an eye time just "whooosssh" ... Ok cut the crap , Running The Race ; Keeping the Faith simply says it all . My school CF theme for 2004 ... and i definitely will miss CF after leaving CBN after 2 years of serving God in His kingdom . Sometimes i'm just amazed at how God work things out in CF ... There were those times when our pass senior committee told us the attendance for CF only reached less than 5 during meetings. Then there were times it will just be more than 10 members . I only started joining CF in form 3 coz was just a baby CHristian then , but i really wanna thank God for His miraculous work in me and using me to serve Him in CF . It was just awesome to see the tremendous growth in CF , myself spiritually and the committee basically . I stil remembered those times in form 3 i was the Publicity Dir when i had to like update 3 boards in a week! Hahah it wasn't any better when our  president then used to like chase me with words like "lei ching ah , what happen to the board ah?" .. haahha those were the times Jen! Well i must say whatever it is Publicity Dir is never an easy job moreover it needs me to "perah" those creative juice from my brain! So ya then somehow i want to testify that god really answers prayers coz I personally prayed for a post that'll relate me to music ... and the best job is Worship Co-ordinator . Well , ya i got it for the pass 2003/2004 board and i must say I wanna say i cannot express how greatful and thankful and glad i am to be able to part of this committee and work with this bunch of crazy friends! To Michelle , you're a great president and a great leader! Without you , i dun think decisions will be able to be achieved easily! To Janet , you're an awesome friend and secretary! Hahahha always so rajin write reports and take attendance .. to Becky , haahah great job in collecting offering as well as helping me make new friends! Ok i know this is long , but somehow i cannot leave out God's work in us coz I wanna thank Him for making my dream and vision come true for the most memorable and historical event that happened in our CF - hosting the Easter Celeb in our very own CBN School Hall! Too bad once again we've reached the end of our serving time , but i hope you all won't stop serving Him and worshipping Him out of CF . U know what girls , i'll always miss working with you all! =)

       Man's best friend . Guess who ?Yes you're right , dogs . Just over a month and a half ago my sis left her dog to let me "dog-sit" while she goes through her delivery and confinement period . In exchange for that , my mum went over to do confinement for her . Hahah , she's a Shit-zu , they call it a dumb blonde dog , or good for nothing dog or whatever . Many names for her, but we call her Chewie . Also call her Chua-ban ka , or ban-ka , or Chewie-wie . She's sooo adorable , and i think you'll never meet anyone or anything in your life with such huge eyes . Becky said her eyes are soo huge it resembles a "ping-pong ball" . Being a dog lover , i won't mind cleaning up her "poohpooh / urine" anytime , or even bathing her once a week . I'll always miss those times when i come home after school you'll see this doggy with the tail wagging and scratching the glass door waiting anxiously for me . I'll always miss those times when she greets me , when she licks my face to wake me up , when she runs around the house with me after she bathes , when she climbs onto me whenever it rains , and even add extra music to my organ when i'm playing it if it rains! Whenever i'm lonely , she's there for me to cheer me up , kiss me (they kiss by licking us) and always sleeping beside me on my bed . She's more of a companian dog rather than an active smart one even though i prefer dogs that are active and not just sit around and be scared bout almost everything! Well , she has a lot of fears man ... she'll just jump up when she trips over something herself and totally hates noise. I'll always miss her! The other day when i was brushing my teeth in the kitchen sink then i realised how much i miss her when i looked on the floor where i put all her things , it's no longer there . The floor mat that used to be her play place in my room is no longer there ... But nevermind , though i don't see her everyday now , i'll still see but not so often . Sigh , this just reflects how true a statement of "Dogs - man's best friends" is soooo true . =(

      I was just wondering ... how can things be so different when someone new comes into our lives? Well , lately life hasn't been nice at all ... besides school and friends , nothing has been nice at home . Except that 2 new lives has been added to the Tan family tree . My 2 nieces that was gifted into this world on June 14 and July 1st . Well of course both my sisters got pregnant almost the same time except it was 2 weeks diff . Anyway , thank god for these beautiful gifts and things has just been different at home . Eldest niece is Serena Lee and younger one is Emerine Lim . Nice name rite ? even though i think the name Serena is a little kolot . Hahha but who cares ain't my name . They're so adorable ok ... I've always think Serena is cute but Emerine is the pretty one . Serena's always sleeping i dunno why , like a little piglet .. after feeding she'll sleep and sleep and sleep .. only now suddenly she's awake since 4 am! Then the other one , boy ... you'll need ear plugs to shut urself up . Emerine cries and screams her lungs out all the time ... i dunno why , my sis said she's very impatient (which baby is not!) and often complains about the dissatisfaction in her . Whenever she bathes , she'll go like 'whea whea whea whea.." while Serena would just keep quiet and lets u bathe her . Anyway , of course they're different they're from the different blood line . My classmate always said that "it's nice to have babies in the house , things get so much merrier" but i kinda disagree .. hahaha coz i personally don't have this fondness for kids ... babies maybe stil ok but when they start crawling and itching they'll go like "whea wheaa mummy i want this mummy i want that!" eeuuu ... then again seeing my 2 sisters went through the 9 months pregnancy it was torrendous ok! I once made a vow i'll never conceive next time! Ok i'd better stop discouraging future mothers out there . So yeah overall now that i've suddenly become an aunty(i hate to admit it!) i'll just have to look at the bright side of them , the cute little teeny weeny chilld .... =)

       Talking about memories , i'm reffering to the 2003/2004 Prefectorial Board . Sigh come to think of it , we've stepped down from our posts for about 1 week now . Things have been so different . When i look at the pics we took last Mon (our official stepping down day) i was so touched and u know .. that kind of feelings u get when u flash back at those memorable pics . I'll never forget this nice experience overall , even though there were times I fret nonstop bout the pathetic long hours we spent in school staying back just to practice our performances and fulfilling our duties for the etc etc big ocassion throughout our time as a prefect . Hmm what i'd remember most is during last year's Everybody's Day... our very first occasion handled under us . It was taxing , tiring , pathetic , but overall enjoying la . I'll never forget the time Sook Kuan and i took to complete the banner that says "Walking Down Memory Lane" ... those times when we had to walk all the way down to Kamdar just to get those black cloth and stil walk up to BUKIT NANAS and start doing it ... those were the days ... then the performance was ecstatic but somehow our prayers didn't work . Hahah the banner that was suppose to drop when we pull it , somehow it didn't ... and things were messed up . But you can't blame us , inexperience teens! Oh then this one very memorable Dikir Barat performance we did during Teacher's Day .. boy i'll never imagine myself sitting down with those malay batik thingey tied over my body and singing those Dikir while doing actions! Hahah .. but we all enjoyed it in the end .. especially those tune of Pink Panther and Gong Xi Fa Chai and Jingle Bells! Then the never-ending smile i had to give when comes to prize giving . Every Monday is Sookie's and my day preparing the darn meja hadiah and yeah ... presenting prizes to my principal to give them away ... we've always said "yaya who cares bout the hadiah if it's nice or not , it's not ours anyway .." i'll always miss that .. and oh gosh during those big big ocassion where prize giving is concerned , man i'll never miss that! Hahahha the amount of time we spent arranging those certs and prizes and throphies to give away .. eeeuu .. but then again that's my job . And especially those times i spent with Sookie , those memorable times we worked together as partners and a team in PlanCo , i'll always miss them! Hmm somehow i dunno if it was planned , but i just wanna thank whoever who put us together to work coz we worked really well! I'll miss your jokes , i'll miss your laughters , i'll miss your sarcasm , i'll miss our conversation during Jalur Gemilang being sung , and i'll miss all ur help when we're together Sookie!

      Emm finally i could get online after sooo many frustrating days from Saturday night til like yesterday night! Just got into my nerves how MBF work things out . So slow just to transfer the money into my Jaring account . Anyway , just a thought for you to ponder . I was just wondering the other day why humans are so easily agitated (maybe it's just me!) when things don't work out the way they want it to be . Even small little things like not the proper attire , not the right food , not the right timing .. etc etc . Hmm ... no wonder God says people are never satisfied . That's why we need Jesus! Ok in other way maybe God sees i haven't been studying much since the past few days .. that's why He decided to suspend my internet for me to study! Anyway , i'm on mc today ... started with the minor soar throat last thurs and now things got worse . Had flu and a little bit of low fever last night . So better rest at home . Sigh health hasn't been nice to me lately . *cough cough*  To everyone out there , eat ur vitamins and take care !
