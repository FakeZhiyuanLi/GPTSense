      An unexpected fire drill today just when the class started. It's a false alarm, somebody accidentally trigerred the alarm. Despite that, we still follow the usual procedure. All of us went to the field anyway. Thank God the system is not connected to the fire station, or else the school could be charged for fraud.

      A Motivational Session today at school for Form 3 and Form 5 students. The facilitator is Raja Shamri bin Raja Husin from Golden Mind Consultant, Kota Bharu which is the panel motivator for MRSM. Program starts at 8:30 a.m and ends at 4:30 p.m.  The facilitator is top-notch, he have been able to make us stay alert all the way through. Although using a prosthethic leg, he is as active as a spinning top. He treats us as we were his younger brothers and sisters, different from other facilitaors which act like uncles lecturing his nephews and nieces. A really brilliant student himself, he shared with us his experience and confide to us that we could be a succesful man like him - 28-years-old, 3 degrees, 3 companies, 18 staffs, and still single.   And I wanted to be much better than him. :-)  BTW, those who wanted to contact him can call or SMS at 013-9617103

      A panic at school this morning I might say, a bee hive have been smashed near the assembly field. Those angry bees have made the assembly field off-limit for anyone for the whole day. The Principal herself made the anouncement. Luckily no one have been stung.   After so many years I finally received a posted mail. These days I usually only received emails. The letter came from Ibrahim, the boy I meet during a Ministry of Education program. Although short it still fun to read. He's very proud of getting number one for his exam and said so in his letter. I don't know why but I decided to reply at once, maybe the charm of written mail. The letter is now already on it's way to Kuala Sleangor. I hope to receive a reply soon!

      Now I realize how close I am to leave this school. The form teacher are already circulating the End of School Certificate form, due to be send in next week. I also informed by my IT Teacher that the Information Technology SPM examination will take place on 13th October, much earlier than other subjects which would happen in November. So I will not need to worry about IT in November, a good thing I think. Wish me luck!  Although I'm generally in good mood today, a distrubing bad dream came bugging me last night. It's about a death of a close relative. Hope it just a dream and not a premonition, I can't afford to lose another family member this year.

      So tired today, just came back from Summerset Rompin yesterday. Such a huge hotel but with small hotel room and an expensive rate. Can't get handphone signal at all!!! I hate the feeling of being 'disconnected'. If not because of picking up my mum I certainly will not go there. Yesterday I ordered a new pair of spectacle. Not much increase in term of power but the glare factor is up by 50%. I think I need to use LCD monitors after this to reduce the srain on my eyes. For the time being the solution is get a clip-on anti radiation filter for my spectacles. Now I have to wait for the orde to come this Saturday.

      Ahh.. my first log. Today I meet Doc Jamal,a fellow Palm user in Kuantan. Waited at Kuantan Parade but he mistaken and went to Megamall instead. Although no serious beaming session happened (Doc Jamal PDA's Ir can't receive anything), what matters is that we meet, get to know each other and have some useful discussion. Our topic ranges from Palm to the latest Harry Potter book and education. Doc Jamal also finds that the latest Harry Potter book is kinda dark and disturbing with Harry's tantrums and all that. Guess that what happened when you don't have parents and don't have anyone to guide you. Pictures are deceving, Doc Jamal appear to be fuller and whiter than the picture in his weblog. Maybe that picture is when he is much younger. ;-) Hope to have a proper Palm User Meeting in Kuantan soon.

      Bad day, my worst nightmare came true. Sigh, lost another family elder. Although she is not my own grandma, but she still part of my family. Al-Fatihah to Atuk Fauziah.  Went to the airport last night to bid farewell to Dr. Burhan and Dr. Zainab. The airport were full with their family and friend wishing them success and good luck in UK. The Dean are also present with his family.      Looks like it was hard for Dr. Borhan to leave.

      Reached home at 7pm after 5 hours journey from  urlLink IIUM  Main Campus, Gombak. Here's some pictures first.     Me and the symbols of IIUM - The Quran and The Scroll.      [L-R] Dad, Dr. Burhan and Dr. Zainab      Dad and Dr. Hafiz   Being a son to a Doctor cum Medical Lecturer I can't escape from people expecting me to follow my parent's footstep. Actually, I can't even be a doctor. I purposely dropped Biology from my SPM (equivelant to O Level) and took Technical Drawing with IT instead. Although I always interact with the medical community by hanging out at  urlLink Kulliyah of Medicine  and Kuantan Hospital, I still find myself not interested with Medicine. Don't know why, maybe I hate those on-calls. I aspire to be a succesful engineer and bussinessman. Insya-Allah.

      I plan to go to IIUM's Convest this Saturday. Contacted seniors at IIUM, Brother Azri and Sister Faatin. Both were busy with exams, and I just get to know that Sister Faatin had changed course at UiTM. Brother Azri in his SMS asked me to send regards (and love) to Zaza. Hope to see their wedding invitation card in a few years time. Hehe... ;-)

      My uncle which has graduated from the Malaysian Military Academy will be posted to Oya Camp, Sibu, Sarawak. His unit is Ordanace, that overlooks the Army inventory and such. Reviewed the SPM timetable courtesy of  urlLink Azra , there are many free days and I actually have to attend eight days only out of the three week period. Also last night emailed to Camil Sijaric School Bosnia, just sending them news regards from my school.

      A very nice suprise today, my mom had bought me a new watch - Timex 25th Anniversary 30 Lap Ironman Triathlon 54581. As you can see, it have a negative display. Very user friendly - it actually have built-in tool tips in the watch. So no more guessing which one to press even when you don't have the manual.     This is my first Timex watch, I usually wears Casio Watches and the toughest too - this one is rated Water Resistant 100m. Before this only Water Resistant 50m. But then it doesn't matter 50m or 100m, I don't dive.

      Hmm, another student suddenly collapsed just before the class ends today. Not one of my classmates but the sister next door. For the past couple of months we have many cases like that, one of it ends with a death. What is happening now? Is the school compund contaminated with toxic stuffs or radioactive? Don't think so, maybe just a coincidence.   Anyway, my dad now is very interested in getting his hand on the 12" iBook. We plan to visit the MacVision shop after this to test drive the iBook.

      A moment of silence today because a death of one of our Form Sixers. Datin Yeoh can't proceed with her speech, too sad because of the death. That's the second student we lose this year. Earlier this year is Allahyarham Zuhair, died of an accident. It also announced that tomorrow there would be a collection for the death of one our student's father. This year, we already have more than five such collection. Amidst the sadness we still strive forward to become the best among the best.

      In the morning attended Pusat Haemodialisis Islam Makmur (PHIM) first Family Day at Balok Beach. PHIM is founded by my father and his friend to help poor people getting dialysis treatment. The beach is crowded with JKR Kuantan and FELDA Pahang Family Day forcing us to move a little further to avoid mix-up.        By the way, Rahmat Wahab we'll be doing the programming job for my uncle's law firm. Don't let us down us Mr. Rahmat, I know you are capable of doing it.

      One-day off today, so I just stay at home for this morning. My dad borrows my handphone, his handphone gone kaput. At noon I will need to go to town to help my dad solve his handphone problem. Maybe he need a new handphone, he always complained that his Motorola phone is not user friendly. That what happened when he buys electronic equipments without consulting me first. :-)  Nazley discovered my blog although I didn't tell him and asked whether my picture is up-to-date or not. Still waiting for reply from Mr. Hamid Misnan regarding my uncle's request to have him code a software, if he don't accept it within a week or so might as well I pass the job to other programmers in  urlLink PalmX .

      At 8:30, Ucle Sharom and his family arrived as he promised. After we have breakfast together, off we go to our orchard located about 5km from my Grandma's house. The orchard is planted with durian and duku langsat trees but only durians is available.      My cousin, Uncle Sharom and my father.      Here's a sample of our durian.   We have a special clone of durian here, nicknamed  'kucing tidur' or literally means sleeping cat. It have thicker flesh and have only one big piece in each of the fruit's segment. It tastes very sweet or just  lemak manis .  At 1.15pm we head home to Kuantan, stop over at Muadzam Shah to see my sister and hand over some souvenirs from New Zealand before reaching home at 5.30 pm. Thank God tomorrow is one day off, I'm feeling very tired now.

He was suprised when I told him we already near his home, we don't tell him before hand. We have lunch at Jaya Jusco Taman Universiti. Bought some apparels and a new wallet at Body Glove shop. Good price, cheaper than the last time at Langkawi.      Madihah & Munir       Lunch at Jaya Jusco   Back at  my uncle's house we have some discussion regarding custom made software for his law firm. I personally recommends Hamid Misnan to code the software. At dusk we are back in Pagoh. Uncle Lu was already home,  then came Azreen and his girlfriend to pick up his two sisters. My Grandma's home is still under renovation, I hope it will complete soon to avoid further inconveniences.

She also teached my two younger younger sisters at the same school. Turned out that her husband is Yusran's older brother, no wonder there's quite a lot of hostel boys attending the wedding. Among them is Shaffarin, Hilmi, and Khairil.

      Went to Parkson Kuantan Plaza yesterday night. Bumped across Safiyah, my classmate in Form 3 and her whole family. Her mother recognized me and know that I am in Form 5 although I'm pretty sure I never met her before. That is quite odd as people usually can't guess my age properly when meet the first time. People usually got the impression that I am 2-3 years younger than I should - that is because of my slightly 'immature' face. Or they got the impression that I'm at least a college student, especially among IIUM lecturers and staff - mainly due to my profiency in English. ;-) My dad also looks younger than he should, often people tought that he is my brother when we went out together.

       Who's In My Heart?   Some people wondered, what is meant by Single, Not Available, Not Seeking that I wrote at the sidebar. No brainer, but the last two actually means that I *don't* have have some one special and not even bother to look for one. For now, that's it. Purposely left an empty space in my heart, I don't know yet how long it will remain like that. At least until I secured a place at a university, or most probably until I graduate. The empty space doesn't hurt me either, I feel free instead.  Many people said that having a special person in your heart will drive you to excel. That is not necessarily true, many of my friends who had girlfriend doesn't excel either. For me, it's not necessary and more or less a burden in my opinion. 'Maintaining' a girlfriend is not cheap you know, you have to call them, bring them for a date, buy them presents, remember their birthday, etc. Such expenses would eat up my tech-spending and savings! It is proven relationship formed during school years are usually not destined to last, so I would not unnecessarily waste my time and money on girlfriends now. Call me selfish but better save my money to buy new PDA, CDs, and anything that strikes my fancy.   But then what is my driving force? My family, teachers, and family friends. How about friends? Some of it, maybe. But most just bring negative impacts especially schoolmates. That's why I befriended my father coulleages like Doc Jamal, Mr. Zaharin and Doc Ailin. Even Mr. Asri, a bank support manager that I knew through the net. I don't care if my schoolmates says that I'm anti-social or what not. Better have a few friends that benefits me, sharing knowledge and advices rather than having a battalion of outlaw friends.

      Well, well. Spent almost the whole day at Mid Valley Megamall. Met Auntie Hamisah at Delifrance, she have a brand new Sony Ericsson P800 with her. Sigh, Treo 600 went out too late. That minus one member from my family Palm User Group. Doesn't matter as long as it serves the purpose. She just need basic PDA functionalities so the lack of 3rd-party apps won't bother her.

      So many days without any updates. Bummer, I miss my PII 300Mhz dinosour and my Streamyx. The trip to KL with the State Foundation is not exactly pleasant, too many hiccups here and there. Delayed bus, filthy room at UKM (my school's hostel is much better). Have a session with the Dean Faculty of Education on Tuesday morning before having a quick tour of UKM. Then off we went to Multimedia University in Cyberjaya. Their facilities are impressive such as the library and E-Gallery. A real bummer, the air-con not working due to maintainance and  black-out  during briefing in the lecture hall. Then I think I had enough, called my auntie to pick me up at Putra Mosque, the next stop. Nice timing, I arrived there just when my auntie is about to park her car. Quickly I unload my stuffs from the bus into the car. Off I went to Bangi, safe and sound. Whereas my friends had their trip to PM's Residence cancelled, trapped in traffic jam, their buses broke down and only reached Kuantan at midnight. Pity them, I just lounge around at Bangi while they face those mishaps. Wednesday afternoon my parents picked me up and visit the National Museum with my cousins. Didn't see the main exhibition, just went to the Exotic Cats & Birds Display and Gold Heritage Display. Quite interesting, different from the usual display. At night went to Mid Valley Megamall for dinner. Bye for now, pictures later.

We discussed many things mainly computer-related stuffs.  After that went to the Clinic at Jalan Gambut for my Orthodontic appointment. Only at 6.15pm I went home with my father now packing my luggage for my seminar tomorrow and holiday. Yay!

My classmates and the rest of students taking Technical Drawing is going to KUKTEM this very moment. They will spend a night there tonight before having their tour of the campus tomorrow.

You'll also will jump straight to her blog if you search for   urlLink Azra Ain  and click I'm Feeling Lucky. Before this there are no relevant results if you search for it.  Finally,  urlLink Covertec  had replied my email enquiring to advertise for them at my site -  urlLink My Palm Guide . They asked me to pick a PDA case and they'll FedEx it for free in return for a link to them at my site and a review (a good one perhaps).    urlLink     I picked this one - It worths RM130-RM160   So I picked a black leather case for my Dad's Zire71 as when he bought it there's no free casing in stock and exchange it with a memory card instead. That will be his birthday present on 4th November. I'm using an old PDA so I doubt  urlLink Covertec  had any in stock. By the way, they must want me to review their latest product don't they?  - Sound of  Syukur  by  Raihan  -

I'm suprised that his English is quite good too. But then he followed my layout too much, and have the same disclaimer too!  urlLink Shahril , please change that!  By the way, both of them put a link to my blog at my site so I'm obliged to do the same.

       Looking Back   School holiday tomorrow until Monday because of Deepavali and Ramadhan. Now I only have 4 days of schooling before SPM. Time no more flies, it just rocketed through your life these days. It is like it was only yesterday I was a newcomer at my school, asking for Principal's signature for Orientation Program. Now I'm asking her signature for Matriculation and End of School Certificate. Looking back, my school - Abdul Rahman Talib Secondary School had been one of the institution that had influenced me. Being a Pioneer Smart School I was exposed to IT and then fell in love with it. I'm used to be the 'unofficial' Technician and IT Consultant for the school. I also had my first taste of digital photography and videography here. What else? Graphic design and publishing, the cover for this year School Magazine is designed by me. ;-) Last year's design is mine too. Not forgetting Website building knowledge I acquire along the way.   Thanks for all teachers, the management especially the Principal, and my friends (especially 3G 2001 and part of 5SJ 2003). Thanks Pn. Siti Aini who gave me the School Cadet uniform I wear in the picture at the sidebar and choosing me to go to The First National Reading Camp at Kuala Lumpur last May. Thanks to the Principal, Pn. Hjh. Rubiah Hj. Sidin for all her efforts and support (I still owe her a brand new school website). Thanks to all my class teachers, Ustazah Umbi Kalthum (Form 1), Pn. Suharti Ishak (Form 2), Pn. Anita Ibrahim (Form 3) & Pn. Zalilah (Form 4 & 5). Love you all, thanks for everything!

       IIUM Islamic Orientation Program   Just came back from Awana Kijal, Terengganu for the above mentioned program. Not an orientation program but more like a family day, but with Islamic input. Totally unique IIUM style. This time it involves three Kulliyahs (Faculties) - Kulliyah of Medicine, Pharmacy and Allied Health Sciences. It started yesterday afternoon with registration and lunch. Then at 3pm the Oficiating Ceremony by Prof. Dato' Dr. Md. Tahir Azhar, Dean of Kulliyyah of Medicine followed by Tazkirah by Ustaz Hamidon, Director of Sultan Ahmad Shah Mosque, IIUM Gombak. Only then they have their group picture.     One Big Happy IIUM Kuantan Family      Ustaz Hamidon giving his tazkirah   The hotel was nice, unique styling with one huge atrium. The roof styling actually resembles the traditional Malay house, and I think it is awfuly similiar with the one found at Kulliyah of Architecture and Enviromental Design (KAED) Building in Gombak campus. The program was great, in fact IIUM Family Day had never disappointed me. No nonsense stuffs, no karaoke, just pure fun and educating family day and getting to know each other better. For me, that's the way family day should be. We also had Qiamullail early this morning but I didn't go - not feeling very well.     Shortly after coming back home from Awana Kijal at 10am I went to the neighbourhood surau to help them to do some spring cleaning to prepare for Ramadhan. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I came a little bit late so there's little work to do.     Resting after cleaning up   - Sound of  Keluarga Bahagia  by  Saujana  -

       What The Heck Is This?      This picture is taken at my neighbour's house yesterday. The house is empty, they have moved I assume. Don't know who did it but really, it caught my attention.  If you have read Malaysian papers this week, it seems that gangsterisme among students is on the rise. We are shocked by the death of two students in two weeks time - both incidents happened in the East Coast. OK, about the latest case which happened at my neighbour state - a Form 4 student was stabbed to death by a Form 5 Student. The weapon is not mentioned but apparently the attacker didn't run away and stay in the school compound until the police pick him up. Maybe only then he realized he had killed someone and regret it.  Then, the earlier case which happened in my very own state - my auntie also teaches at the school. This time a Form 4 student caused the death of a Form 5 student after a fight. The Form 5 student didn't die at once. He was admitted to Mentakab Hospital before transferred to Kuantan Hospital.   OK, here's some insider's information from Kuantan Hospital. That student at first said to his parents that his injury is not because of fighting, he said that he had tumbled down a stair. When he is admitted to Kuantan Hospital, he went through an ultrasound examination and CT Scan. Those scans revealed internal bleeding of his liver. He was operated later, only before he is pushed into the operation theatre he admitted to his parents that the injury is because of fighting.   Sadly, he died after the operation. There are no apparent bruises but the injury is serious. I'm told that the attacker learned "Silat Gayung" (Malay Martial Art) and maybe that had made his punches lethal. Silat was used by Malay warriors and soldiers during the olden times and it can be lethal. Well, does this means that Silat has to be banned for students? This a serious case of misuse of a treasured Malay heritage. I hope such cases wouldn't happen anymore, Al-Fatihah to those students. I wonder how the school management and Education Department would handle this?  PS:   urlLink  Utusan

      Alhamdulillah, I've completed my IT paper for SPM. No need to read IT stuffs anymore! But I can't stop reading IT stuffs anyway, I'm a tech freak remember? The paper supposed to take only 3 hours to complete but we are confined to the computer lab for a whole stretch of 6 hours from 8am to 2pm! This is because of so many special procedures for this particular paper, especiallly regarding data verification. Each answers in digital form is made into three copies and will be send to the Examination Board by several ways. The primary method is by FTP upload, then we have CDs and lastly diskettes. The files are also saved in the PC we used just in case all the copies corrupted. One school in Jerantut, Pahang had all their student's files corrupted due to virus. So you pretty had to depend on the reliability of the PC in order to excel. Despite all the measures taken to ensure the files intergrity, Raimy had his Visual Basic coding corrupted and Khairil also lose some of his files.  After completed the paper I drop-by at the post office to pay the water bill and send a mail to my uncle in Labuan. Bought a new Rabbani CD at Speedy Video Kuantan Parade titled Kenangan Lalu (Past Memories). It's a 2 CD compilation album which compiles all their hit songs from all album except Qiblat. Noticed that Qiblat and Kenangan Lalu had different labels. Qiblat is under Intifada Studios while Kenangan Lalu is still under EMI. Guess that EMI made this album to remembers Rabbani that had left them and set up their own Intifada Studios. It's a good move, following what Hijjaz had done.  - Sound of  Intifada  by  Rabbani  -

       A Question of Heart   What would you feel, if your best friend changed his behaviour drastically from a saint to a no-good student? I feel sad, angry, and at the same time I pity him too. I knew him in Form 1 and we are classmates in Form 3. At that time he's not talkative, always obey the school rules, achieve well in academic and don't even dare to speak to girls. I shall not reveal his name, but his name means "Perfection" in Arabic. He fared better in PMR, scored 8A while I only managed to get 7A.  When he entered Form 4, he started to change The first thing that I notice that he no longer wear his 'songkok', which is his identity before. He no longer flush when talking with girls, but he went too far in this particular aspect. Got himself a girlfriend and become the hot gossip of the school. According to a reliable source, their relationship broke up and that was a turning point that changed his personality. To relieve the pain in heart he started to befriend those no-good guys and started smoking. His results started to fall, he only managed to get half the number of A that I scored in the Mid-Year Examination. By right he should score better, he is a brighter student than me, in fact I learned a lot from him.  His personality change make our relationship cold and bitter, my no-nonsense policy translated into my actions. I growled at him in the public regarding his smoking habit, distancing myself from him so I shall not get 'infected'. I actually have planned with a good friend of mine to confront him today and have a slow talk with him, to try bring him back to his goodself. But the plan can't be carried out because of some unforseen obstacles. What I could do now is just pray to Allah that he will realize his mistake and change, hopefully in this few weeks before SPM starts.  Come to think of it, thank God that I had nothing to break up. This is the very reason why I choose to wall my heart from a girl - until I'm ready to break it one day. The loss of my grandfather had already affected me so much. Yes, it do brings poitive impacts to me, made me strive harder for excellence and to be a better Muslim . But at times it bring sorrow to me, especially when I'm alone. Only God knows what would happen to me if my heart is not walled off and then dumped just like that.   This reminds me the last song the late Zairie of Raihan had wrote:    Bonds of Love     Why are you so sad  And why is it so bad  When someone leaves you behind  Won't you ever know  Don't you realise  It's just a part of life  When you fall in love  With someone sometime  It's smile with a broken heart   Only falling in love  With Allah  The bonds of love survive   No mountain too high when there's a will  No river too wide believe there's a way  Come to Allah you'll never fail  The truth's so close it shall prevail   Allah we belong to you  And everything we do  We do it all for you  Allah always by our side  Guiding us to the light  Everything shines bright  No matter day or night    Ya Hafeez, I can't never thank You enough for all Your protection.  - Sound of Bonds of Love by Raihan -

       urlLink Utusan Malaysia Online - Dalam Negeri   Hate to hear this, another incident of gangsterisme in Perak - again. Lately, there's so many such cases in Perak, like MCKK and what not. Is it the students in Perak too violent or Perak Education Department decided not to cover it up at all. What would happen to this students? Having police records surely doesn't help them to pursue higher learning.

       LRT, Taxi, Monorail and Jabra   Instead of heading straight to Bangi to pick up the medicine Uncle Azman agreed to meet me at Sogo. Took the Putra LRT from Wangsa Maju to Masjid before exchanging to STAR and went to Bandaray station. There he was, with Auntie Hamisah at The Fish Shop. The kids opted to stayed at home today and have cartoon marathon. After a quick lunch I stashed my luggage in Uncle Azman's car before we took a taxi to Low Yat Plaza. How arrogant the taxi driver was! My uncle kindly asked him to change the radio channel from Tamil station to something else but he refused and scold him back. We had to bear with the Tamil music all the way to Low Yat Plaza.  The real reason to be at Low Yat Plaza is the PDA Phone Fair. Both Uncle Azman and Auntie Hamisah already have a PDA Phone, O2 XDA II and P800 respectively. So why we are here? To get a pair of Bluetooth headset of course! The Bluetooth headset on offer is the Jabra BT200 Free Speak. Listed price is RM399 but we get it for RM350 because we bought two.     The Jabra BT200 Free Speak Bluetooth Headset   The Jabra BT headset design is different from Sony Ericsson and Nokia. Instead of covering the ear, Jabra put the transmitter at the back of the ear. Such design allows Auntie Hamisah to wear the BT headset under her tudung, so don't get the impression she is scolding you when she giving orders to her kids thru the BT headset with her phone tucked away in the handbag.     Uncle Azman & Auntie Hamisah   After that we went drop by at Berjaya Times Square before heading back to Sogo using the Monorail. The Monorail is suprisingly spacious inside but the ride is harsher than any other light rail system in KL. After walking down the stairs of Medan Tunku's Monorail staion we met this one poor guy. He came all the way from Kluang, Johore for work reason only to be robbed and beaten. Furthermore, he had one big scar at the back of his head as a result of the robbery. Without any money left he pleaded us to give him some money. He even produced a copy of his police report so we gave him enough money to get back to Kluang.      One of KL Monorail's Train   After that we ate at Umar Khayyam Restaurant at Medan Tunku before we went to Sogo to pick up the car and go to Uncle Azman's house in Bangi.

       An Unexpected Change of Plan - Again   I should be back in Kuantan right now, but here I am somewhere else. I've been instructed to go to KL to pick up some medicine for my mum and I gladly accepted the job. My Grandmother asked me to go to KL with Uncle Fadzlu tomorrow but I wanted to go today. By the way, Uncle Fadzlu planned to visit his fiance's family at Mentakab first before going back to KL. So I decided to follow Uncle Fuad but then came Kak Nana with a KL-bound bus ticket in hand. So we made a deal - I take the bus and she ride the Kembara with Uncle Fuad and his family.     Uncle Fuad & Anum   The bus ride is very comfortable, instead of 4 seats in a row it only have 3 seats in a row with seats comparable to the one found in Bussines Class flights. It wouldn't be very comfortable in the Kembara for long distance ride anyway. The traffic is smooth, without any major trafiic congestion. The traffic only slowed at Senawang for a bus parking at the side and at the tunnel construction area in Sg. Besi. I deaprted from Pagoh at 1pm and arrived at Pasar Seni LRT Station at 3.20pm. From there I took the LRT to KLCC to join Uncle Fuad and his family. Not forgetting Kak Nana too. Then came Zareeda and Kak Syuhada joining us.     Auntie Lin & Farish   While Uncle Fuad and Auntie Lin do their shopping at Isetan I went to Kinokuniya and bought myself Executive Orders by Tom Clancy. The novel is basically about an even worse version of 11 Septmeber - the plane don't hit WTC but hit the Capitol killing almost the whole Congress. Then I dropped by at Arch Collection and bought an art piece for myself. For mum and dad I bought them veneer bookmarks.     Kak Syuhada & Kak Nana   We had dinner at KLCC's food court. It is not cramped with people as usual, maybe most of KLites is still at their hometowns for Eid. Before going home we went to Parkson and unexpectedly I had to buy Kak Nana, Kak Syuhada and Zareeda a pencil case for each one of them. There goes RM30+. Kak Syuhada's pencil case was the most exepensive but I would not see her very often after this anway as she would pursue her study in UK next year.  After that I went to Uncle Daud's house in the Kembara while Kak Nana, Kak Syuhada and Zareeda took the LRT. After sending Farish to sleep Uncle Fuad and Auntie Lin went out again to pick up Kak Nana, Kak Syuhada and Zareeda at the LRT station before visiting Dato' Rahim (my grand uncle) house.

       An Unexpected Change of Plan   As my readers should have know I should be in Johore this 1st of Syawal but I found myself in Jengka, Pahang due to some family matters. Anyway, here the pictures. I'll be in Johore tomorrow and hopefully I can blog from there.     Uncle Azman & Muhammad      My Father & my Sisters      Auntie Siti & Uncle Hanafi   By the way, Uncle Azman had bought an O2 XDA II to replace his stolen original XDA. I managed to get this two pix and tested it's Bluetooth function. I succesfully paired with his wife's P800 and transfered a 2MB+ MP3 file without much problem. It's camera is good and the screen is very bright. But then, it doesn't include WiFi as what it advertised and only availabe as an SDIO expansion card?

       Operation Salvage   While everybody else is busy cooking food for Eid-ul-Fitri something had fried my motherboard especially the ports. With the ports out I can't give commands to my computer and I couldn't fix a missing system file. Zahir came to help but no avail. The problem is the Hard Disk contain several important personal files and it had not been backuped! *Gasp* Thank God I had another PC, a Pentium II dinosour that is even older than the broken PC. Following Zahir's suggestion I plugged it in to the PII PC to salvage the files.   Plugging the hard disk should be an esay task but with the weird layout of the Dell PII PC I had to attempt twice before I succeed. Then I managed to salvage all the files which is now on it's way to a CD-R for archiving. Boy, this is really a snag to my Class Album VCD project which is still under authoring process. With my digital studio down looks like I had to borrow dad's laptop to complete the project. The hard disk is still functioning so I seal it and put it somewhere safe.  In December updates would be sparse, next two week I'll be shuttling between Johor (Mom's home state) and Pahang (Dad's home state). Then Langkawi and KL before school open next year. Wait, I didn't have to go to school right? So I'll be dozing off at home, writing and surfing. Maybe I'll came to school if my two younger sisters managed to get a place at my former school.  This year I'll be celebrating Eid at Pagoh, Muar, Johor for the first time after my grandfather passed away last May. *Sob, sob* :-( This reminds me of the last gift my late grandfather had give to all his family members and friends. It's a piece of carved lightweight wood with a rope meant to be hung in a car. It is inscripted with Arabic calligraphy. One side is written 'Bismillahi-Rahmani-Rahim' (In The Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful) while the other side is written 'Ya Hafeez' (The Protector).     'Ya Hafeez' (The Protector)      'Bismillahi-Rahmani-Rahim' (In The Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful)   If you see any car with it hanging around it should be my mother's side family or family friends. Notice the shape and inscription, it is custom ordered and the shop promised not to produce a similiar shape with the exact inscription for sale. If you ask the car owner with it, he/she would know Allahyarham A. Rahman @ Abdullah bin Hj. Said. If they don't, tell me.  Once again, may you all have a joyous Syawal!  - Sound of  Save Me  by  Remy Zero  -

All of my classmates got so excited finishing it until they don't even care to studt for Chemistry. ;-) Amidst the happiness, my 'twin' ('twin' as we share the same birthday and mother name) Mubin got admitted to hospital after an accident before Chemistry paper 3 starts. From my sources he suffered fractured rib and had to do the last paper at the hospital. Maybe after my dad confirmed his ward I'll go visit him.  Here the pictures!

       1000 and Counting...   Well, my blog had surpassed 1000 visitors in just a few months time. This is comparable to my earlier web site -  urlLink My Palm Guide . But this is a far cry from  urlLink Pak Adib's  blog. At his 100th post he already have 19514 visitors! COngratulations!  By the way, the  urlLink Great Malaysian Blog List  ( urlLink GMBL ) had also reached 1000 blogs with  urlLink Azra's  blog being the 1000th. As the news is displayed at main page of  urlLink GMBL  her number of visitors increased rapidly. Unfortunately her PC is down, so she can't make any new postings.  Hmm, the number of visitors from Singapore had surpassed those from United Kingdom. The link at  urlLink Ruqayyah's  page had been contagious with more of her friends put a link to both  urlLink Azra's  and my blog. Nevertheless it's a good developement but after this I have to resurrect  urlLink My Palm Guide  - number of visitors had dropped due to the lack of updates.   - Sound of  Bidadari  by  Rabbani  -

       A New Friend   Looks like international traffic to my site is on the increase. First in place after Malaysia is UK - maybe it just those Malaysians staying abroad like  urlLink Sang Kelate ,  urlLink Idlan Zakaria  & Doc Borhan. Get to know a new blog friend today from Singapore -  urlLink Ruqayyah  a.k.a  urlLink Akai . She landed on my page through my tag-board posting at  urlLink eNovel  and I noticed her by her posting at Azra's blog requesting to add a link to her blog. Chatted with her through MSN Messenger before iftar.  By the way, all links directing to my school site is dead. We are on the process of moving the site. Maybe it will be up and running when the school opens in January.  - Sound of  It's Easier to Run  by  Linkin Park  -

       Ramadhan @ SMART   For the past few days I only have Iftar (breaking of fast) at home so today for change I went to my school to have Iftar with my teachers and friends. Don't forget Tarawih Paryer too. We have apprentice Hafiz Imams from Sg. Karang to lead the prayer. Most probably the first and the last time I'll have Iftar at my school.

       Last Day of the Year   Hmm, I'm not going to write about this year in review today. Instead, I want to share with you all a true story that happened earlier this year - True Story of a Rumor                                                           True Story of a Rumor   	It all started during the first Editorial Board session 2003 meeting. We were discussing about changes and improvements that we need to do for that year. We used the year 2001 edition of the school magazine as our reference. We ran through it cover to cover to find any weaknesses that we need to fix and anything good that we can carry over to this year. We stopped at the Police Cadet page as their picture was one of the best picture in the Co-Curriculum section.  	Referring to the picture Pn. Liza, our Advisor said that one of our ex-student that had moved to MRSM Jasin died of a motorcycle accident with a lorry last year. She said it was Ashraf, my close friend since Standard Six. I was shocked to hear it and expressed my condolence, but deep in my heart I feel that something was not right. I asked her for more information and put a note in my mind. After gathering enough information we just continue our meeting.  	On my way home my mind start boggling,  all the information from Pn. Liza contradicts what I know about Ashraf. I don't blame her because she got the news from someone else. But I'm still not sure whether he's alive or not as anyone can live one minute and leave this world another minute. As with the case of my junior who died in a car accident.  	Once I reached home I told the news to my younger sister. She is a friend to one of Ashraf's younger sister, Nadiah. So I hope to get some hints from her. She's also shocked to hear the news but then she said that Nadiah never talked about it and she sounds cheerful every time she called Nadiah. So how come Ashraf can be dead?  	The next day I went on to gather information from my classmates. I talked to Husna and Azlyn but once again the information contradicts and have some added twist to it. They said that he died of a motorcycle accident with a lorry last year in Shah Alam while on his way to his girlfriend's house to study Mathematics. The word Shah Alam caught my mind, it is now became clearer to me that this news about Ashraf is just a rumor. How come he can ride a motorcycle all the way to Shah Alam since his house is in Banting and it is not a short distance between the two town.  	But still, I'm not confident enough that this is just a joke. I'm yet to talk to him personally so on Saturday I asked my sister to call Nadiah to ask for Ashrafs mobile phone number. My sister called Nadiah’s house but she have gone out. I'm getting worried. "This is not good," I said to myself. At last his mother herself called me.  	She asked why I'm asking for his phone number, are there any important thing to tell  him? Trying to hide my anxiety I said no, nothing important to tell him just I want to ask him the phone numbers of my other classmates in MRSM Jasin. She satisfied with my answer and went on asking how's my study and family. Finally I gained my strength to ask the question I wanted to know the most, is Ashraf still alive?  	She was surprised to hear me to ask such question and asked me why I said so. I told her all about the rumors I heard. Then calmly she said... Yes, Ashraf is still alive and all the news I heard is a fake. Then we bursted into a big laugh. What a joke! Alhamdulillah, at last I find out the truth.  "O you who believe, if a sinner comes to you with news, VERIFY IT, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done." [Al-Hujuraat, 49:6]  Wassalam, may this be a lesson for us not to believe in rumors.

       Good News Galore!   As most Malaysians is aware, the PMR result is just released yesterday with some 19,000 students got straight As. Alhamdulillah, my younger sister and cousin is one of them. I SMSed Datin Ezizah, how's SMART doing. We managed to get 57 straight As scorers - 21 9As, 21 8As, and the rest is 7As. Sound a little low than last year but don't forget, a few classes of this batch had been transferred to Sri Kuantan.  My younger sister who got 5As in UPSR managed to get a place in SMART. The Orientation will start this Sunday.  The wedding of Uncle Fadzlu is confirmed also. The 'Akad Nikah' ceremony will be held on the night of 1st May 2004, the reception at Desa Bakti, Mentakab, Pahang will be held the next day. While the reception at our side at Pagoh, Muar, Johor will be held on 3rd May 2004.   Meanwhile, Uncle Azwan had officially propsed his girlfriend last Wednesday and gave her a 'cincin tanda'. The engagement will be around March next year. Well, looks like next year would be quite busy.   By the way, a fellow blogger  urlLink Kak CNMA  (Tech support for  urlLink eNovel:JAD ) is now officially engaged to Shuth. Congratulations!

       An Unexpected Twist   The  urlLink eNovel: Jangan Ada Dendam  is quite popular among Malaysian blogger community nowadays with thousands of readers. Initially there's only Sri Diah and MBA as Mak and Abah. Then came Rudy as Along before Eyes filling in as Souraya. Now came Angah, actually the original writer is Azra but somehow I became the writer. How come? That's the secret between the writer team, can't tell the reader all about it.  The base idea is provided by Azra, but to write Angah character is a very challenging task. Angah is an exact opposite of me, she's a girl while I'm a boy (or I should use man from now on?), she's active in school while I'm not, she's the second child while I'm first, she don't know to cook but I do (What do you want? Fried rice? Grilled Salmon?). The most difficult part is that she had special relationship before, while I'm not. So that's why I had to rely on Azra for the materials, alone Angah character wouldn't be lifelike. Pretending to be Angah is really challenging, even more challenging than SPM Penulisan questions.  Come to think of it, sometimes I asked myself. "I'm an unexperienced writer writing a series together with a renowned novelist like Sri Diah?" It sounds crazy right? But this all made possible because of my blog, the internet and a little bit of luck and talent. Without Internet the eNovel is not even possible! What more of knowing Sri Diah, MBA and Rudy? Surely the Internet has changed how we communicate.  Talking about communication this few days I've been an unofficial Technical helpdesk. First Doc Burhan asks about Bluetooth, apparently in UK there's a new law that requires everyone to use handsfree kit in cars. If not, 30 pounds fine on the spot. So he wants to a dangle free handsfree solution. Then came Kak Mysanc asking about PDA Phone. Today, somebody suddenly messaged me thru Yahoo Messenger asking about installing Pocket Quran in new XDA II. He only wanted to be known as Raie. Who is this guy? Must be rich enough to buy an XDA II.  OK, I'll be out of town until Monday. Maybe I wouldn't blog. See you all around!

       Hard to Get a Job?   Well, that's a major problem now, especially for Malaysian graduates. I'm no graduate but Insya'allah will be one day. Watched this TV program, titled 'Ritma Menara' or something like that hosted by Fazlee. It talked about this problem, and graduates and university students give their feedbacks. Some says too choosy, some say lack of right attitude, and lack of skills needed by the industry.  For the last one is true especially in IT industry in Malaysia. I've read in The Star In.Tech Raya Edition that our local IT graduates doesn't even know relatively basic programming languages such as Visual Basic. Heck, even I learned that for SPM and have made a simple program. Even Shahril took one step furher to learn C++.  Back to the TV program, it was Ok. Fazlee is quite a good host. But at the end of the show, they feature university students singing complete with a band. (Apparently it's a band club of one university in KL) Is that the kind of gradutes we want to potray? So many time to waste to practice singing while I've seen my relatives busy finishing assignments each semester break. Heck, do having featured singing in TV have any value in your CV? Unless you apply to be background singer, that's it.   My dad as a lecturer pointed out that's why Malays in universities is still backward. So fond of wasting time, 'gila glamour' and too busy coupling while students from other race are busy studying and meet their lecturers to learn more. May my friends and I will not behave like that in university. Ameen.

      Wargh, the journey from KL to Kuantan is tiring so I didn't blog yesterday. The bus was OK but why must it stop at Restoran Delima in Temerloh? The price is exorbitantly high - a packet of Mister Potato costs RM3.50 while a can of 100 Plus costs RM1.80! The place is in bad condition and the staffs is not friendly at all. The bus drivers must have been bribed to stop at such an awful place. Grrr, I really hate it.

      I'm supposed to go back to Kuantan today but Auntie Hamisah made me postpone my journey home to tomorrow. So I picked up mum's medicine at Uncle Zafar's house. He already left for work so I just took it in the mailbox. His wife and kids is still in Johore. After buying the ticket to Kuantan at Kajang Bus Station I followed Uncle Azman to his new branch office at Section 8, Bangi before going to his main office at Kompleks Diamond in Bangi too.  For dinner we went to Famosa House which serves Malay, Chinese, Nyonya and Western food. The owner is a Muslim Chinese and is staffed mostly by Malays. True to it's name, it had the Portugese theme with authentic artifacts displayed at the premise such as antique bowls and guns. So I decided to try Nyonya cuisine which I never tried before. Just as we want to walk out from Famosa House we saw this one guy egoistically brandishing his new Jabra BT Headset. He must be thinking he's the only one in Bangi to have it before Uncle Azman took his own Jabra BT Headset from his pocket and wear it. Uncle Azman purposely don't want to wear it during dinner because his XDA is set to auto answer and he don't want his caller to hear him chewing food and sipping drink.  Then we went to Uncle Azman's branch office which is the same row as the Famosa House to bring some souvenir stock for his new clients for days to come. Drop by at Warta to buy some stuffs before going back to Uncle Azman's house.

       Bloggers Meet: Offline      Pahang State Mosque - Take En Route to Meet MBA There   Yesterday at 8:30 in the morning I sat for the JPJ ststic test. Quite challenging but managed to pass with a score of 94%. I would be able to learn to dirve after this. After about an hour or so I walked all the way to Maybank near Mydin to deposit a cheque for my mum. Then I continue walking to IIUM Kuantan City Campus when I received a call from  urlLink MBA  that he's already in Kuantan on his way back to KL from Terengganu. He have not came to Kuantan for 10 years so I asked him to wait at the State Mosque, a prominent landmark of Kuantan that has been there for more than ten years. Then I go there by walking again, MBA is already waiting.     MBA Thinking the Next Episode for eNovel   It's only 10:20 am, so most shops are not open yet so off we go to Alif 24-hours  road side stall  cafe in front of Kuantan Plaza. Our meeting lasted for over an hour discussing mainly about the  urlLink eNovel  and IT stuffs such as PDAs and web technology. After that he sent me back to my dad's office and he continue his journey back to KL.  Looks like I've been meeting blogger offline for two weeks in a row. Last week on Tuesday also I've met  urlLink Pak Adib  at Rain Nudle, KLCC together with his friend Khairil. Truly he's a great person giving so many tips and advices on education, career and life. Dad gave me that too but I aspire to be an engineer so I have to meet an engineer to get more in-depth insight. ^_^ He's a reader, so I shown him Digital Fortress by Dan Brown that I've bought at Kinokuniya. Looks like he had bought it too and enjoy reading it.     The Reader: Pak Adib   The waiter at Rain Nudle must be wondering what the heck we three have in common to be hanging out there for so long. Each of us a generation apart - Pak Adib is 52, Kharil 30+ (I guess) and me just 18-years-old. Wonder what their guess is, but can't be a family meet - Khairil brought along his slew of gadgets, laptop, iPaq and P800 while Pak Adib with his Tungsten T3, Wireless Keyboard and SE T610. Me? Just my old Visor Edge, the trusty 3310, 64MB thumbdrive and a digital camera.     Khairil With His P800   It's raining heavily in Kuantan now, hopefully it won't flood the town. Have another appointment with someone famous  this  next week too. Just wait and see who he is....  - Sound of  Another Perfect Day  by  American Hi-Fi  -

       Clock Tower In the Garden of Knowledge and Virtue      Tadaa! The Clock Tower at the new Indera Mahkota Campus of  urlLink International Islamic University Malaysia ! The Indera Mahkota Campus houses health related Kulliyahs (Faculties) such as:    Kulliyah of Medicine     Kulliyah of Pharmacy     Kulliyah of Allied Health Sciences    More is coming up such as Dentistry and Nursing. But I won't be studying here, don't even take Biology for my SPM.  Time is flying fast, it has been seven years that I've been 'part of' IIUM particularly Kulliyah of Medicine (by hanging out at my dad's office) . Oddly, being near with all the doctors and professors don't even make me more fond of Medicine and make more fond of IT instead.   At the Kulliyah of Medicine is where I've been exposed to computer networking, PC configuration, the internet and so on. InsyaAllah if my SPM result is good, maybe I'll pursue my degree in Engineering at IIUM, adding six more years on top of the seven years. Or may I not? But there's not many options, I wanted to study in English so UTM, UKM is out of question. MMU is so damn expensive together with all other private universties. Overseas? Save that for Masters (hopefully) as I feel I'm more needed here for the time being. Need to look after my three younger sisters plus continue to be tech consultant for the extended family at both my father and mother side which earns me quite a lot.   Relatively speaking, that's it. -Sound of  Subuh Yang Terakhir  by  Rabbani  -

       A Blog  Shutdowned...  Reopened   Today,  13th January 2004  a good net friend of mine, Ruqayyah Ramli had  shutdown  reopened her blog at  urlLink http://frozen-emotions.blogspot.com  . Her blogs had been my regular read for the past few months, filled with advices, experiences and poem. Very  sad  happy to see such a good blog  closed  reopened. Here it is, some of her poems published in her blog before.    Kekasih, Isi hatimu kau luahkan padaku, Terpegun aku dengan sucinya cintamu, Namun sayang ianya bukan untukku, Kasihmu untuk si dia itu.  Sedih di hati hiba tak terkata, Tapi mendengar aku terpaksa, Kerana jika bukan sebagai kawan, Tiada cara lain untukku berbicara.  ---------------------------------------------  Ya Allah perasaan cinta adalah dariMu, Membuatku rindu termenung selalu, Ya Allah lidahku kelu, aku keliru, Mengapa cinta rasanya begitu? Ya Allah Kau peliharalah daku, Dari dosa mengikut nafsu, Mudah-mudahan Kau tunjukkan daku, Jalan yang benar yang diredhaiMu.  ---------------------------------------------  Remaja Islam mencari pelita, Tergapai-gapai dalam kegelapan, Cahaya yang sementara disangka cinta, Diambil lalu jatuh ke lubang penipuan.  Adakah si remaja terlalu bersendirian? Rasa kosong dan sepi di jiwa, Dahagakan kekasih dan jua teman, Sehingga segalanya sanggup dikorbankan?  Remaja jangan lah engkau mudah tertipu, Cari lah ilmu, itu yang perlu, Kerna sesungguhnya pengalaman masih terlalu sikit, Dunia yang belum dilihat masih terlalu luas.  -------------------------------------------------  Dalam mencari kebenaran kehidupan, Aku berdoa padaMu Tuhan, Didiklah aku, pimpinlah aku, Jauh dari jalan kemungkaran.  Selamatkan aku dari penipuan, Penipuan dalam perasaan, Dalam kelakuan, Dalam pergaulan.  Hari demi hari, usia mudaku luput perlahan-lahan, Maut yang sentiasa menunggu, takkan pernah ku tahu saatnya, Kurniakanlah aku kebijaksanaan, Agar yang hak dan batil dapat ku bezakan.  Allah jauhilah daku dari kekesalan, Semoga doaku Engkau kurniakan, Segalanya ku serahkan, Kerana Ku yakin Engkau lah tujuan sebenar, Mengapa aku menjalani kehidupan

       A Poem   Found this at  urlLink Ruqayyah's  site. Let's analyze it a bit. See wether I could apply what I've learned in English Literature during Form 4 & Form 5 in this poem. ;-)     To A Friend   An unexpected meet,  In the month of Ramadhan,  Month full of blessing,  Each a total stranger,  But together our horizon expanded   We shared joy and laughter,  Up and down,  Checking on each other  Although without face nor voice   An unexpected twist,  Of fate and time,  A wake up call for me,  To be a better person   You trusted me,  When others have not,  You tought me to trust,  When I have not   Our friendship might be short,  But I treasure every bit of it,  A true gem,  In a mountain of glass   We might part now,  Our path might never cross,  Thanks for everything,  Your time,  Your company,  Your views,  I can't never thank you enough      The writer's name is not mentioned, for secrecy perhaps? Oh well, the writer must be a Muslim, the first stanze clearly mention the month of Ramadhan. The month that their friendship begin.  The last line of stanza two -  Although without face nor voice  suggests that the friendship is thru the internet, must have been chatted a lot eh? Or at least emailed each other.   Stanza three, something unexpected happened, something suprising that might halt their friendship. But it is not that bad, the writer somehow became a better person due to the event.  The next stanza talked about trust. Ruqayyah had made he/she learn to trust and share with somebody else by trusting him/her first. Something he/she had never done before. If it's really meant to her, Ruqayyah must have been a very good friend.  Then the writer thanks Ruqayyah for their friendship, saying that she is a true friend. The words  Our friendship might be short  might indicates that the month of Ramadhan mentioned in the first stanza is the month if Ramadhan of this very Hijri year! That's only two months! Well, but the friendship had bring benefits to the writer I presume, and he/she highly appreciate it.  The last stanza, the writer says goodbye and he/she thank her very much. Don't know why they might never meet again, but it must the unexpected event in stanza three.  That's the meaning of the poem. Let us see the language side. The words used is simple, plain words composed into the poem. Simile is used in stanza five -  A true gem, In a mountain of glass .  That's all I can say, forgot must of what I've learned already. :-P Oh well, I do this analysis just to give some work to my brain so it will be ready to learn again anytime.   - Sound of  Raikan Cinta  by  M.

Thank God there's so many chat friends who's willing to chat with me and kill my time such as Dr. Burhan, Ain Ar-Rahmah, Eyes, Ruqayyah and Raie. Now I'm at school to take data and informations to be uploaded in the new website.  Usually I don't have any headaches, and if I do it's because of fever. My body heal itself pretty quick so in one or two days I should fine. But this week the headache lingering around all the time. Yesterday it became worse, especially after solah and then I mention somebody name in my doa'. Is it a sign, something is awfully wrong with somebody? For many instances if I feel uneasy, there's something wrong but not until it gave me headaches like this. Ya Allah Ya Hafeez, protect me, my family, and my friends from mishaps and the lies of Satan.  On the other side, I've discovered that someone from   Royal Brunei Airlines, Brunei  had been visiting my weblog daily. Who is he/she? Came out and show yourself. Drop your email below, if you are really the person. I have agift for you. :-D

       New Blog Template   The original template only give me one sidebar and it's not enough for all the stuffs I want to put. So I decided to edit it a little bit and give me one more sidebar. I'm not experienced in manually coding sites so it took me a whole day to edit it. Tell me if there's any glitches on this new template.  By the way, drop by at  urlLink eNovel  for another update by me. This time I write the character of Achik, Angah's younger brother. Looks like I'm the only one who write two characters in  urlLink eNovel.

       Ronin   Ronin is a Japanese word which means masterless samurai and today I feel pretty much like a one. During war, samurais do espionage and covert ops for their masters. During peace time, they are jobless and known as Ronin. Now is very much 'peace time' to me, no more 'wars' of study and learning.  The 11-year routine imprinted in my brain have made me automtically woke up early in the morning like I always do on schooling days, plus the manic also. But unfortunately my body clock seems to be a little bit awry, it woke me up at 5. The day before it was at 3am, which pretty much disturbs my sleep.   Not doing anything had made me sloppy, now I forgotten the lessons thought to me. It took me a quite a while to match the teacher's to their name yesterday except for the top Admin and Mr. Ramly of course. My contacts database is scrambled and I have to re-organize it again. My handwriting is bad now, after not practiced for almost two months. Thank God my language skills in both Bahasa Malaysia and English is not affected that much with this blog as my practice ground.  At least starting tomorrow I can do some work for my former 'master' (the school). I had succesfully acquired the webspace to bulid the new official website for S.M.K Abdul Rahman Talib from Articulate-X. Thanks to Mr. Ramly who had paid for it and Miss Yaz for introducing the company. The domain name is www.smkart.net but it hadn't propagated fully on the internet.  Hopefully this website project would be a success!

       Back to School   I'm on five months holiday so why would I went to school on Sunday? Read on.  Today my parents I accompanied my younger sister Khadijah for Form 1 registration at my (former) school, Abdul Rahman Talib Secondary School. I'm the one who rose early in the morning, even earlier than my sister. Maybe I just got too excited to get to meet with my beloved teachers again. ;-)     Al-Falah Hall Circa 2001      A Happy Father   As usual the venue is Al-Falah Hall, the hall that had been a venue to hundreds of victories and joyous moments, thousands of laughters and cries. The Hall will also be the place where I will be getting my SPM result three months from now. Hopefully it will be great, with God willing.     MB and his Son   This year's intake is six classes with two classes offering Arabic Language. Most students came from Kuantan, a far cry from the early days when students came from all over Pahang. Oh yes, this year SMART is 40 years old. As old as most parents sending in their childrens today. Most students came with their parents and also plus a brother or sister, so the Hall can't accomodate them all.     My Father and My Sister      Teacher Normala and her Daughter Lily    The most outstandning parent today is none other than the MB of Pahang himself, Dato' Seri Adnan bin Yaakob who despite his tight schedule came to register his son. By the way, he had trusted two of his daughters to SMART before. One of them is in Matriculation. He also represented all the parents to symbolically hand over their children to SMART to be educated and shaped to be a person who could contribute to their religion, family, community and country.   Abdul Rahman Talib Secondary School Knowledge, Compassion, Smart  (Ilmu, Ihsan, Bestari)     Proud to be a SMARTian!

This is not in Mecca of course, it was at my school during our Hajj Simulation for Islamic Education. I hope one day we could really take picture like this in Mecca one day InsyaAllah.  By the way, I had found again my long lost senior thru her posting at eNovel. She had followed the eNovel since series 1. Good to see you again  urlLink Kak Nieza ! I'll also will be starting my drving theory lesson tomorrow. I know, it's a little bit late but last month I've been out of town for 17 days out of 31 days! So can't even find the time to arrange the class. Wish me luck!  - Sound of  Al-Hijrah  by  Raihan  -

       Happy New Year!!!   Looks like some of my friends are too bored waiting for SPM result and fired a lengthy email to all of her classmate. Hmm, this New Year is filled with uncertainites. The outcome of SPM would determine the whole year course. Resolutions for 2004? Here's some.  1. Get rid of 'mim-alif-lam-sin' syndrome. (Sorry, I copied you  urlLink teacher !) 2. Stay girlfriendless so I can do thing on my own. (Yeeha!) 3. Organize my digital pictures and music. 4. Complete my many postponed projects. 5. Get my own domain for my blog!  Others? I'm thinking now and some are private so can't tell you all. Anyway, Happy New Year! May Allah fill this year with happiness.

       Thanks....   Thanks to all bloggers who congratulated my SPM result. Nothing to boast about just 5A and 4B. Managed to get an A in Bahasa Malaysia, English, Mathematics, Additional Mathematics and Chemistry. Got an A1 for GCE O-Level English also which is based on my composition. This means that my composition is quite good eh?  Hehe, angkat bakul betul!  The composition I wrote is to answer the question 'An Invention I Can't Live Without'. It's not hard to guess what the invention is - the Internet of course! I wrote the brief history of Internet, applications, and of course the blogging culture. Thanks to all my fellow bloggers who write wonderful and insightful posts. Truly my blog had bring me much rizq. Got to know some nice new friends and contacts. And even securing my first website building contract!  For next week I'll give you all an insight into three projects by Muslim NGOs in Pahang which my dad is directly involved. I hope by sharing the insight would motivate more people among us to initiate projects that would bring up the image of us Muslims. We have been lagging behind in this, we should catch up and I hope I would be able to contribute in the future. Right now what can I do is spread the knowledge. Insya-Allah.  The Projects Are:  Pusat Haemodialisis Islam Makmur (Haemodialysis Center)   Klinik Al-Amin (Clinic)   Rumah Anak Yatim Cahaya Makmur (Orphanage Home)

       Updates and Such   Hadn't been updating my blogs for a few day, a bit lazy. I'm pretty much lounging at home so there's not much to story about. ^_^ Actually i've been a bit busy with my practical driving lesson since Saturday. On the road that's it. Driving a Kancil which don't fit me really well. The leg room is too cramped for my long leg and the pedals are too close together for my wide feet. Managed to drive smoothly anyway. So far no accidents, not a single pole knocked over.  Enough about drving lesson. Let's move on to photo blog updates. Two New Pictures at Two Lenses last week:   urlLink     urlLink     OK, move on to another story. Heh, moving really fast eh? ;-) Yesterday while i'm waiting for my driving lesson a SMS arrived. It's from my friend which are now in Australian Matriculation program in Shah Alam. Won't reveal his name but some of  urlLink my   urlLink friends  would be able to guess who's who. Oh my God, he's seeking advices from me regrading coupling! How to a win a girl's heart more spesifically! Man, he know that I'm not experienced in such matters as geeks like me prefer (or forced) to be single. Haha! He's younger than me, being a PTS student and like a brother to me. So just gave him a few tips I've got from now-happily married people and what I've learned from my observation.   Come on my friend, hold your horses. Wait till SPM result came out this Saturday. Uh-uh. Told him what to do after result came out (he and the girl are from same school). If she got excellent result be the first to congratulate her, otherwise get near her and cheer her up. Good advice or not? That's what you get from an unexperienced and un-professional advisors.  Hmm, people somehow loves to ask me things, if technical matters no problem, I'll be glad to help even! But personal matters and relationships? For heavens sake, please ask other people! Some of my friends might be offended by this statement, so I apologize in advance.   - Sound of  My Immortal  by  Evanescence  -

       The Da Vinci Code      While Pak Adib found Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is out of stock at Kinokuniya I managed to get a 2004 reprint edition at Popular Bookshop. It's just arrived when I went there on Thursday night. Talk about being lucky. ;-)  I'm a fast reader, so I pretty much 'devoured' the book and finished it at 3 in the morning. Really fast paced and exciting with suprising twist of  urlLink plots  and riddles. Dan Brown is such a good author with immense details, impeccable research and gripping storyline. So gripping that I feel like I'm in Paris myself. :-D How I wish to set foot on Europe someday without studying there.   Meanwhile,  urlLink Azleen  had started teaching Dr. Wahab's son Danish Bahasa Malaysia. A year in UK had made Danish's written BM quite sloppy and he got pretty much confused in reading as he refused to practice. Dr. Wahab asked me to find a post-SPM friend to teach so I reccomended her as Hasnul can't take the job. Oh well, didn't know that Azleen love kids so looks like she would be a good teacher. After all, she is one of the best student in SMART.

       Murid Oh Murid   Instead of the usual Guru Oh Guru (Teacher, O Teacher) here's Murid Oh Murid (Student O Student). ;-)      Jika hari ini seorang guru hatinya terluka Jika hari ini seorang guru menolak laba Jika hari ini seorang guru dihina dicerca Jika hari ini seorang guru disaman dibicara Jika hari ini seorang guru terperuk di belnatara Jika hari ini seorang guru sekolahlah rumahnya Jika hari ini seorang guru sakit jiwa Jika hari ini seorang guru dipancitkan keretanya Jika hari ini seorang guru dibelasah penjaga Jika hari ini seorang guru lebih tua dari usia  Segalanya tidak mengapa Tiada apa balasan dipinta Hanya sekadar menumpang bangga Andai kalian mencapai jaya Penuh rela punuh redha Keranamu murid tercinta   Cikgu Azhar Daud S.M.K Abdul Rahman Talib 16 Mei 2003       Pondering upon the poem, I asked myself. Had I thanked my teachers? Some I had, some I had not. Teachers play a vital role in our lives. So even in the future (or for some of us even now) you are making more money than your teachers don't belittle them no matter how much you hate their attitude and/or methods. Because we don't know our future, we might be a teacher ourself. Don't be only then we'll know their hardship and appreciate your teachers. Had you thanked your teachers?

Creating this 'baby' made me busy for a few days a back and have turn down a chatting appointment. Sorry, my friend, I'll get the info you want as soon as possible. This baby is real smooth, with 512MB RAM and 80GB SATA HDD. A far cry from the PC I've used before, a 6-years-old Pentium II 300Mhz. Sound so geeky right? Heheh, I do love technology.

       Manual of Rescuscitation   By Associate Professor Dr. Ariff bin Osman  MBBS (Malaya), M. Medicine (Anaesthesiology) (UKM)     MANUAL OF RESCUSCITATION  for Medical Undergraduates and Health Professionals  is meant to complement the series of lecture and the various workshops that these students will undergo. It will also benefit anyone who wishes to learn aout resuscitation such as paramedics, doctors, parents and teachers. For those who are already competent in this field, this book will serve as a quick revision for BLS, ACLS, PALS, and ATLS.  There is now an increased public awareness of the value and role of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It is therefore not surprising that the public expect a reasonable level of expertise of medical doctors in the application of the CPR techniques during emergency situations. Unfortunately,many newly qualified doctors often lack confidence and are usually lost when faced with such situations, as they had not received practical training before graduation. The manuals hence will be an easy guide and reference for them.

       Of Friends and Memories...   Last Sunday went to Kuantan Airport to pick up my relatives who just came back from Mecca when I met my junior at school, Syamim who is now in form 5 in MRSM Jasin. Really happy to meet, although we have met last month. For your information, the Chelsea jersey I wear is bought with him for a special price. ;-)     Yesterday I had lunch with Raja Shamri and Abang Z at Benteng (riverside), Kuantan to discuss the new design of the website and web services to be implemented. Also discussed about what smartphone to buy and his bussines plans and experiences. The lunch is on Abang Raja, who else going to pay. Also met Aizat, my classmate who just came back from playing golf with his friends.  Today went to school to get last year school magazine. Liyana Yanti is also at school to pick up something else and we had quite a long chat to catch up what's going since November last year. Bummer, the magazine cover doesn't follow my design but oh well, it was nicely done and I already have my desgin used in the cover for 2002. Flipping thru the English sections it turns out most writing is done by my ex-3G cronies such Faezar, Safiyah and Nadiah.Then had lunch with Dad, Dr. Basri, and Mr. Nazri (PHIM's manager) before going to BSN to buy the UPU form.         Dedicated to the Loving Memory of Our Brothers Hafiz B. Ishak (1984-2002) and Zuhair (1987-2003)   A creative haer obsessed with satistaction, Was a drama in an unkind society, You have given them a star filled night, And you have given them a beautiful bouquet of sunflowers, But for you there's only contempt, Though you pourself into that flame and you present it so proudly, This world cannot accept you, So long starry nights, You gave to us and you took away from us, The one thing we never acknowledge, Your life...  Adapted by, Ahmad Waqiyuddin 5SH   My Memory   Dedicated to the Loving Memory of Our Friend Mohd Zuhair Syafiq bin Zulkifli (1987-2003).  There is no more you In this funny world There is no more you In thus tiny world You went to a place No one can imagine where One day you are smiling The next day you stopped walking You are now free But I am still here With thoughts of you And one day No one knows when I will be there with you  Syaza Zuhairah 4SB       Being a teenager and a student is the best and happiest moments of our life. So little responsbilities, so carefree...  But sadly, some of us are destined to return to God at this very stage of life. We can't be sure how long we will stay in this world so live our life to the fullest within the limits of our religion and strive for excellence in whatever we do. Don't waste any time loitering at shopping complexes and having too much entertainment because we don't know how much time are left for us.  I'll be starting my driving lesson practical this week and Insya-Allah I would learn to be a good driver. Zuhair's death is a bitter reminder to all of us in SMART to drive carefully and sensibly.   May Allah bless the souls of our brothers - Hafiz B. Ishak and Mohd Zuhair Syafiq bin Zulkifli. Amin Ya Rabbal Alamin.  - Sound of  Bring Me to Life  by  Evanasance  -

       Client Meet: Offline      Met my client today, YM Raja Shamri bin Raja Husin, Consultant and Managing Director of  urlLink Golden Minds Consultant . I was contacted by him thru my blog a few weeks back to build a website for his company. I gladly accepted the offer, it's an honour to work with such a great person. All deals and payment are made over the phone and internet. I've completed the basic version of his website, the enhanced version is in the pipeline.  Actually I wanted to discuss with him about the site design and forum implementation but since my dad came along they discuss about student motivation and excellence. Maybe I need to arrange another appointment tomorrow. ;-)  BTW, he said the people in the Ministry of Education tipped off to him SPM result will came out end of this month. Man, I'm both thrilled and afraid to hear that.

       Pengenalan: eNovel Jangan Ada Dendam   Sesetengah pembaca tertanya-tanya, bagaimana  urlLink eNovel Jangan Ada Dendam  bermula dan bagaimana pula pelaksanaanya. Di sini adalah pengenalan kepada  urlLink eNovel Jangan Ada Dendam  yang dipetik dari laman web  urlLink http://novel2u.blogspot.com .   Bismillahirrahmanirrahim... Assalamualaikum wbt...  Sebuah novel biasanya ditulis oleh seorang pengarang sahaja. Semua watak yang terdapat dalam sesebuah novel adalah hasil kreativiti pengarang tersebut. Pengarang boleh menggunakan orang ketiga sebagai pencerita watak ataupun bertindak sebagai pemegang watak sendiri. Namun dalam JAD ia adalah suatu kelainan. Setiap watak dikarang oleh penulis yang berlainan dan menceritakan mengenai watak sendiri dalam certia atau situasi tersebut.  Pada asalnya  urlLink  MBA   secara suka-suka mengacah  urlLink  Sri Diah   untuk berduet dalam menghasilkan sebuah novel. Pelawaan ini boleh menjadi jika  urlLink  MBA   bersungguh-sungguh ataupun memang ada satu plot cerita yang menarik. Namun tanpa dirancang,  urlLink  Sri Diah   telah menulis petikan satu babak dari novel terbarunya "Jangan Ada Dusta" dalam blognya. Ia menceritakan bagi pihak wanita. Lantas  urlLink  MBA   pula menulis dalam blognya "Jangan Ada Dusta Versi Lelaki" yang menceritakan dari perspektif lelaki pula. Semenjak dari itu kami saling balas-membalas versi.  Akhirnya satu blog khusus untuk JAD diwujudkan. Secara tidak sengaja  urlLink  MBA   memberitahu JAD bermakna Jangan Ada Dendam kepada teman komuniti Haiku dan dari situ bermulalah nama JAD menjadi Jangan Ada Dendam.    urlLink  Rudy   pula datang untuk menulis sebagai  Along ,  Aida  sebagai  Eyes  dan  Souraya  dan  Ibnu Ariff  sebagai Angah.  Bagaimana penyelarasan dibuat?. Biasanya setiap penulis menulis apa sahaja watak mereka atau menjawab persoalan terdahulu yang dikemukakan oleh penulis sebelumnya. Cuma kadang-kadang seorang berdua dari kami ada juga berunding melalui Internet bagi mencari kata sepakat ataupun ingin mengagah penulis lain.   Sekian adanya.

       Back to Kuantan   After three days in Pagoh I'm back in Kuantan again. Reached home at 3 pm yesterday. Most of my uncles and aunties are present except for Uncle Fuad which is far away in Labuan. Mr. White do a headcount and turns out there's 50 of us cramped into my grandma's house. Because of the sheer number all of us have to take queue to use the bathroom except for my grandma who have her own attached bath. That's just a small hassle compared to the happiness of being merrily together with all family members. For this year Qurban, we sacrificed a cow shared between my mum's siblings. Some pictures here, I'm still tired of travelling to write a long post.

       October Profile   OCTOBER: Loves to chat. Loves those who loves him. Loves to takes things at the center. Attractive and suave. Inner and physical beauty. Does not lie or pretend. Sympathetic. Treats friends importantly. Always making friends. Easily hurt but recovers easily. Daydreamer. Opinionated. Does not care of what others think. Emotional. Decisive. Strong clairvoyance. Loves to travel! The arts and literature. Soft-spoken, loving and caring. Romantic! Touchy and easily jealous. Concerned. Loves outdoors. Just and fair.Spendthrift and easily influenced. Easily lose confidence. Loves children.      Is this me? Well, most of it to some degree. Loves to travel? Yes I do, and next week I'll be travelling out of town again to do some shopping and meet my relatives. Soft-spoken? More harsh words than soothing words but at times I do pick my words carefully to not offend people. The arts and literature? Love tech and a self-professed geek but I admit there's still a place for the arts and literature. Four series at  urlLink eNovel Jangan Ada Dendam  would attest that. And the haiku down here of course. Loves children? Hmm, don't know. I don't have the talent to look after small childrens and they usually stay away from me as I'm a bit grumpy. But this  urlLink girl , another Octoberian born 355 days after me do love children. You can see from the picture don't you?. :-D Ok, got to go.     Used without permission. :-P

       The Next Step   Post-SPM Blues...   Which course to choose? Medic, Engineering or Law?  Where to study? KPM Matriculation, UIA Matriculation, Overseas or Diploma?  Overseas or Local? Which one better?  Forms to fill, deadline to catch up! UPU, JPA, MARA, UTP!   urlLink     One of our top-scorer wondering of the future   Used without permission ;-)   Well, that's some of the questions that numbing the minds of most of us, post-SPM students. Some of the questions I've answered long ago, and not all the options above is valid for me but those questions still haunts many of my friends.   Course to choose? Well, those top-scoring friends of mine especially girls mostly choose Medicine. Most are keen on the course, but some are not but apply anyway. Why?  Parents suruhlah, cikgu suruh, tak tahu nak pilih course lain, etc, etc.  Erk? So far only one girl stands strong to not apply for Medicine and choose another field eventhough she is qualified for the course. Well, too bad most of us can't see what other options are available out there. Thank God I can see other options thru my parents (thanks so much!), extended family, and teachers. Not forgetting professionals out there like  urlLink Pak Adib  and countless dad's friends. The place in medical schools is so limited and can't even accomodate all straight-A1 scorers! Why people only see Medicine? One, always highlighted by parents and teachers. Second, job security - especially to the fairer sex. Third, highly regarded as a noble profession by our society. Fourth and so on, think for yourself. :-P   Meanwhile, IT is in the bad-light now with a seemingly grim career prospect especially with those highly regarded Indian technocrats competing with locals. Medicine is not an option for me as I didn't took up Biology so I've settled for Engineering. And if not I'll fallback to Law, with my strong base in language.  Course decided, now the problem is where to study? KPM (Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia) Matriculation offer the most place, and a wide choice of course later from many local universities. Their offer will also be earlier than the other programmes so many wouldn't risk it and just went there. But there's a catch, you still don't know where you'll end up. It might be the far-flung north at UUM or down south at UTM and everything in between. Me? Insya'Allah I'll settle for UIA matriculation, even though I need to gamble a little bit. It's a good and established English medium University, a plus point in securing a job later on I might say.  That's my decision and I don't see it will change anymore. Time is running out, deadline is nearing. Then there's some people asking me why I didn't apply for JPA or Petronas-sponsored overseas programme as I'm still eligible for it? Well, I'm not the kind of guy who would unnecessarily trouble myself  (manja, that's it. :-P)  and being overseas would disrupt my plans. Besides, the course I wanted is already available here. Is it true overseas graduates have an edge over local graduates? Maybe, considering the challenges they had gone through, mastering foreign languages, and being exposed to more cutting edge technology. But then, I'm still be able to turn the tide right? Being here I'm able to pick some other skills, gaining experiences thru freelance works, getting professional certificates such as Certified Internet Webmaster and expanding network and contacts. My plan is by the time I graduate I already have a couple of years of work experience and I got testimonials from my clients to prove it. My work? Freelance web desinger (tech consultancy is also included in the package ^_^ ). Then, there's still so much things to fight for here and I intend to give back something to the society.   That's it, wish me luck. With God's willing, my own determination, and support from the family I'll succeed. Also wishing success for all post-SPM students, especially bloggers such as  urlLink Habibah ,  urlLink Azra ,  urlLink Shahril ,  urlLink Salleh ,  urlLink Azleen, Safiyah  &  urlLink Wawa . Oh yes, post-O-Level students also like  urlLink Nad .  *End Note: My opinions might not necessarily be true. So, don't shoot me if I'm wrong.   Sound of  Allahu  by  Raihan

       Boys (Half) Day Out   Last Friday morning while I'm just about to take my bath someone called my home phone. A nice suprise, it was Faiz - my long lost friend. Last seen him before he went to S.M Sains Muar last two years. I've been trying to call him but didn't succeed. He asked me to wait outside my house and he'll pick me up to go to the town. I agreed, I have to go to the town also anyway. After seeking permission from Dad I quickly ready myself.  After 20 minutes Faiz arrived at my house. He's driving his dad's old green Automatic Volvo. Shariman is already in the car, Faiz picked him up before me. I get in his car and we cross the Kuantan Town to Kubang Buaya area which is on the other side of the town. Faiz drive slow and steady but he easily got disorientated and can't navigate the town well. Althoug a bit slow and took the wrong turnings we safely arriived at Farhan's house to pick him up and head back to town.  The time is only 8.30 am and the bank are not opened yet so they went to the post office while I deposit some cheques for Mum at Maybank automated machine. We waited a few minutes for BSN to open together with a bunch of fellow post-SPM students who had the same task - pay the BPKP processing fee. It didn't take us long, after 10-minutes we are all finished. With many time to spare we head to Alif for breakfast. Faiz paid for us. :-)  Then we moved on to Teluk Chempedak, nothing much just checking out the other side of the bay and updating each other what had happened for the past two years. A lot of thing had changed but Faiz is still the Faiz I've known before. Excessively worried about things, funny, and afraid of cats. ;-) Haha, quite a time we had. We still have a lot of time so Faiz decided to find the houses of his fellow SAMURAns. More spesifically - girls' houses. ;-)  Ceh, takde kerja betul!  Faiz managed to find two houses and just say hi to them from the car before we move on to Hasnul's house.     [L-R] Faiz & Hasnul      [L-R] Shariman & Farhan   After about twenty minutes at Hasnul's we head back to Farhan's to send him home before dropping me off at town for Friday prayer. Faiz then pick his mother at SMK Panglima Perang before heading to their house at Damansara Kuantan.

       Of Driving Test and Long Lost Friends   Today I took my driving test, for the second time actually after failing the on the road test. :P The last time I took a small junction too fast, rally style hehe.... The tester for today is the same as the last time, he cut the test short and made me took two small junction. This time I made it quite nicely and as a result I passed the test. Now waiting to get the drving license, and don't forget to buy two sets of P sticker.  While waiting for my turn to take the test, I've met two long lost primary school friends - Syamil & Salwa. I recognized Syamil immediately, but Syamil and I decided to verify it's really Salwa by making a miss call. Where did he got her phone number? From another primary school friend he said. Syamil didn't change much, just being taller and a bit slimmer but Salwa's skin tone had brighten too much as a result of being a 'puteri lilin' since she enter secondary school. That's why we are not sure it's really her in the first place.   We haven't met each other for almost six years although Kuantan is not that big and all of us attended secondary schools around Kuantan. After getting re-acquanted, we updated each other what each of us had been up to and what's up with our other friends. Syamil got a place at Pahang Matriculation Centre while Salwa is waiting for UIA English Language Matriculation.   Speaking of Matriculation College let's take a look at one of terms and conditions of the programme.     At first, I found the term very ridiculous. Who would be married before the offer came out? If you are already married or get married during the programme the offer is revoked immediately. But then... A shocking news from my two long-lost friends - a few of our fellow primary school friends are already married and one them already have a child! *Gasp* I thought they were joking but I can't find the twinkle of mischief in their eyes and they wouldn't joke about such news. Even more, Salwa swored she had met our friend and her husband.  Masya-Allah, I'm stupefied to hear the news and made me speechless for a few moments. I don't want to elaborate much on this matter by mentioning who's who or when but I hope they would live happily with their respective husband/wife. But suffice to say, there's a stark contrast between my primary school and seconday school in term of socio-economic background. In my primary school, many of them are from the lower category with some are the urban poor. On the other hand at my secondary school many are from the upper category with many of them parents are professionals, businessmen, and a few politicians. We have MB's son and daughters even. And I suspect that difference made such early marriage happen. Wallahualam...   This had made really appreciate what I have now - a good family, great friends, a chance to further my studies and pursuing my dreams. And being  super-single  too... :P

       O Boss, Where Art Thou?    This week I'm supposed to present to him his company's new logo designed by Shahril and start to soft-launch goldenminds.net online forum but I can't get in touch with him. Called his two mobile numbers, but no answer. Maybe I should call him at home. He might be overseas right now, like he did a few weeks back. I may be my own boss in this website business, but actually my clients/customers are my new bosses!   This is one thing I hate doing jobs remotely over the internet because I'm pretty much depends on the client to feed me with the necessary materials and infos by the means of email and phone. If his office is somewhere near my house I could easily just climb up to his office and kindly ask for the materials from his staff but his office is far away at Kota Bharu so that's out of question. Well, looks like my job will take a break this week. And that's mean my payment will also be delayed. :S   Note: Later on I've called his house, his sister said he is still not back from somewhere. Can't hear very well, too many static & interference on the line perhaps. Oh well, he must have went overseas again and left his mobile phone with his staff.

       A Malay Engagement    The Day Before Engagement   My family and I are supposed to be in Jengka on Friday but due to some problem we could be at my grandparent's home on Saturday. Pak Lang and Mak Teh is already there when we arrived but Uncle Azwan, the one that will be engaged had not arrived yet. Wonder where he is back then? It's impossible for him not to be here for such an important ocassion.  He finally showed up at 5:30 pm, only to complain his body aching all over due to representing the Ordnance Corps in rugby and already feeling feverish. Uncle Azman and Pak Long arrived shortly after while my grandma is busy at the kitchen with my aunties cooking rendang for tomorrow.  After Maghrib prayer we started being busy with the  hantaran  (gifts), a neighbour made the  sirih junjung  while the rest is taken care of by Auntie Hamisah and Auntie Siti. As agreed with the women's family, we will send 7 tray of  hantaran . Meanwhile, Uncle Azwan is busy arranging a portion of the  wang hantaran  in the album.     Uncle Azwan busy arranging the money   Then after Isya', the meeting starts to discuss the itineary for tomorrow. Pak Long as the eldest son volunteered to be the spokeperson for tomorrow. Also discussed some other details such as how to get to there and such.   The Engagement Day   At 7am we are already busy cooking for the  kenduri doa selamat , scheduled at 9am. The  kenduri doa selamat  went as planned and it took about 45 minutes. After that is some last minute preparation and finishing. Uncle Azwan took the trouble going to the town to buy the metal polish and polish the case which will hold the engagement ring.     Last minute polishing      My Grandparents and Cousins   At 11am, our five-car convoy started our journey to Felda Sg. Retang at Jerantut. Uncle Azwan didn't came along - hold the fort, that's the order. ;-) We arrived at noon and the engagement ceremony start soon after. After some discussion and doa selamat, Miss Halijah Ibrahim is declared officially engaged to my uncle, Captain Ahmad Azwan bin Osman. Insya'Allah their wedding wil take place after Eid-ul Fitr end of this year.     Auntie Siti and Auntie Hamisah      My grandma and her would be daughter-in-law   By the way, next Sunday is another uncle's wedding at Mentakab. ^_^ And oh yes, what do you all think of this new MacOS-themed template? I made it myself. :-)

       Tech Heads: Canon i560 First Impression      Today we'll do a short review of this printer which I acquired recently to replace the Canon S600 which had ceased function. The recomended reatil price of this printer is around RM600, so that makes it a mid-range printer.   Technology    Ink   This model employ a 4-colour Think Tank technology. Each colour is in it's own tank, Black, Cyan, Magenta and Yellow thus reducing the printing cost as you don't need to discard the whole colour catridge when one of the colour is depleted. Personally, I simply love the technology.    Resolution   True 4800 x 1200 dpi Resolution with 2pl & 5pl Ink droplet which is more than enough to print out near-photo quality prints. It also support EXIF print to optimize printouts from digital cameras. But of course, it printouts still can't beat a 6-colour printer or the professional colour lab. Although good enough for casual photos it still lack the details.    Speed   Canon claims 22ppm Monochrome / 15ppm Colour but thay way too optimistic. As I tested, a full page of text took 10 seconds to print while a 4" x 6" borderless photo took a full 50 seconds to print.   Others   The printer is thankfully as claimed is quiet not like my earlier S600. Canon claims it's rated at 39db but I can't possibly verify it. The bundled softwares are mostly Canon own product but it's still easy to use and very functional like the Easy-Web Print app that make sure websites fit in the paper for printing and there's no pictures get cut into halves.

       Visit to Karangkraf - *Updated*   5th April 2004   As promised I'll do a write up of my visit to Karangkraf at Shah Alam. If you don't want to read doesn't matter, it's for my own record anyway.      [L-R] urlLink Sri Diah  & Eyes   My journey started at Renaissance Hotel. After checking out, Mum and I took a taxi to KL Sentral. Mum took  the ERL to KLIA and catch a flight back at 3pm. Meanwhile I stashed my bag in one of the electronic lockers and bought a return Komuter ticket to Shah Alam.     With Sri Diah    The train is late 7-minutes and it took me approximiately 30 minutes to reach Shah Alam. Upon embarkation at Shah Alam station, Sri Diah had just arrived to pick me up. No waiting, just like when I went to meet Pak Adib. :) A short 5 minute drive is all needed to reach Karangkraf and Ultimate Print Headquarters. It is located in front of the Volvo plant and quite easy to find.  We get into the building through the staff's side entrance. Electronic keylock is everywhere, and without a pass and password you couldn't get anywhere. First stop is Sri Diah's room then we proceed to the cafe. Met Majalah PC's editor on our way. Majalah PC had been my regular read a few years back before I 'graduated' to CHIP.      With  urlLink Dr. HM Tuah Iskandar    After lunch on Sri Diah's expense the next compulsory stop  is the book shop. What novel I got? Jangan Ada Dusta of course, signed by the very writer! Back to Sri Diah's room she called Eyes to join in our discussion. After almost two hours at Karangkraf I must make my move. Lucky me, met Dr. HM Tuah Iskandar also!      Morning Walk KLCC Park   3rd April 2004       urlLink Pak Adib  & M. Hasni of PalmX.   Actually I planned to have the morning walk session last week but then Pak Adib had some other program and I also unexpectedly found myself in Bangi and could not make it anyway. Upon M. Hasni's suggestion we met up on the beautiful Saturday morning. I walked all the way from Istana Hotel to KLCC Park. I didn't have to find him, I literally arrived just behind his back aat 7:30 am. :D After exchanging some greeting, we start our warming up. As expected, passer-by gawk at us. Wondering why three unrelated people from different generations meet up and excercise together.  We all 'tawaf' KLCC Park three times and while walking Pak Adib shared with us his knowledge and experience. We stop at his favourite spot on second round and do a bit of 'aerobic'. He made us sit on out toes. That's a bit hard for me, all my 800N of mass only on meagre 37.5 square centimetre. Calculate the pressure, luckily my shoe got some nice cushioning. Hehe. Then at 8:30 am, Dad call me to get back to the hotel for breakfast so I have to go. Insya'Allah I'll get to join him more often once our 'forward base' in KL is reestablished. ;)      "Love maybe blind, but marriage is a real eye-opener" -  urlLink Nourza

       Farewell Lunch   Farewell lunch for  urlLink Azra  today, who is going to MMU next month. She's in Kuantan until Sunday to get the Yayasan Pahang one-off cash incentive. The lunch is sponsored by yours truly after my client dumped a couple of hundred bucks in my Maybank Account. ;-)     [L-R]Hafizah & Azra      [L-R]Qayyum, Anuar, & Me. Why all of us eyeing the other table?      [L-R]Azra & Nad   The lunch is scheduled at noon but have to wait for Azra to settle her stuffs at Yayasan Pahang. Then have to wait for Qayyum and Anuar some more. Only at 12.40pm we headed to Pizza Hut. I made the order quickly and then we get into some chat, updating each other what's up with our friends. Which university to go is the main topic, followed by what jobs we have done and some gossiping of course. :-P Those saucy gossips is kept to us, I won't tell it here. Back to our main topic, looks like only me & Hafizah are waiting for UIA Matriculation. Nad & Qayyum will go to KPM Matriculation. Azra will go to MMU of course. Anuar? He still waiting for an offer.  All in all, it's a good meet although at my expense. After all, I don't know when would I see them next time. So better treat them this time. Ok folks, I'm off to KL (again) tomorrow evening. And good luck to all post-SPM students!

       Allahu - Raihan      Raihan, one of Malaysia's first contemporary Nasyid group came with another first. After recording a Mandarin song in Gema Alam titled Ching Ai Cing Ai, Raihan came up with Allahu in the Urdu language. The song is lengthy at 6:48 minutes with a cheery tone to it. Beware, you could go 'gelek bollywood' upon hearing this song! But don't worry, as with Ching Ai Cing Ai the song Allahu includes Malay translation lyrics into it so you still could understand the meaning of the song.   This Album also have three song which is duet with other artists. They are Taqwa & Iman with S. Jibeng, 'Araftu Ka with Muhammad al-Husayyan, and Dari Tuhan with Awie. Taqwa & Iman, as you expected with S. Jibeng sounds traditional. 'Araftu Ka also are pretty much traditional Arabic song added with a few lines of English and Malay Lyrics. But then, Dari Tuhan with Awie is really superb with both party having solid vocals. I personally loves this song. This song rocks!  There are also three original song written and composed by members of Raihan themselves titled Ababil by Abu Bakar, Sifat-sifat Nabi by Abu bakar & Che Amran and Pesanan Buat Kita by Nazrey. Ababil is a song about the invasion of Mecca by Abrahah prior to the birth Rasulullah s.a.w. It does not just merely retell this story but also relates and made us ponder with our current situation such as the invasion of Iraq and the Palestinian conflict. Sifat-sifat Nabi would nicely complement 25 Rasul in Syukur as it have that cheerful tune, clearly targeted at the younger ones I presume. Pesanan Buat Kita is laden with advice to all of us (the title says it all) and should be pondered upon.  Oddly, this album also features two songs that had been featured in another group album before. Antara 2 Cinta had been originally featured in Kembara Cinta by Saujana, although there's some modification to it's lyrics. Your Face is Bright had also originally included in Impian Kasih by In-Team under the title of The Messenger of Allah.  Last but not least is Doa Tilawah, a traditional nasyid with Malay lyrics by Che Amran. For me, Allahu would deserve 4 out 5 stars. Cut one star because of the two 'unoriginal' songs. Despite that, Raihan vocals are still superb and would put many new nasyid group to shame. Their songs are also professionally arranged, mixed, and engineered.

       Wishing This Is Just a Dream   This morning I read the Idealism, The Philosophy of The Matrix And The True Nature of Matter by  urlLink Harun Yahya  that debates that our life might just be a dream. And this afternoon, I really wish it is just a dream.  A shocking news came after Friday prayer. My younger sister informed me that one of my fellow schoolmate had passed away. Amirul Azwan of 5SB. The news made me down for almost the whole afternoon. This.... is another painful reminder that we must make the best of our chance & oppurtunity. Also another bitter reminder to be careful on the road. Last year, one of the junior passed away because of accident too.  Too bad I was informed late, the funeral took place before Friday prayer.  urlLink Azleen  did attend the funeral. Insya'Allah, I'll pay his family a visit tomorrow.  Al-Fatihah...    The late Amirul Azwan is the one wearing blue cap.  - Sound of  Kau Sahabat Kau Teman  by  Hijjaz  -

       New Site Design    urlLink     This is my latest work for Golden Minds Consultant. This design makeover kept me busy for a few days back, so sorry for the lack of update. I always opt for a minimalist design. Rarely using any kind of elaborate design, and like the clean uncluttered design. That's what they request anyway. My inspiration? IKEA - Simple and practical. Hehe, but never been there. :P  Meanwhile, my client supposed to be in town today. Hopefully I can negotiate for a higher pay. ;)

       Lesson Number Two     Taken from  urlLink http://pakwattan.blogdrive.com    2.	Pengurusan wang dengan baik, jangan kedekut sangat, jangan boros sangat      Well, I'm used to be stingy with friends but that had been improved since I got a substantial income ( betul tak kawan-kawan?  :P) but then the problem is I can easily overspent indulging myself in things I like. Tech stuffs mainly. Actually I'm itching to upgrade my Nokia 3310 to an MMS phone complete with camera so I can moblog from anywhere.   But then when I reconsider that with the same amount of money I could get a decent low end PC, I cancelled my upgrade plan. That MMS phone would most probably drain my money (MMS & GPRS charges all that). But then with a PC, even though a low end one I could continue make money with this web design business. If there's no jobs either, at least it would be helpful to do all the assignments and such. A money drainer versus a potential money maker - I surely choose the later.  This also reminds me of Uncle Azman, who opt to invest by buying shophouses rather than buying those luxury cars although his business friends kept teasing him to change his Toyota Camry to Mercedes or BMWs. His friends even go to the extent to offer to help him trade in his car for a Mercedes and do for him all the procedures.  Tanggung beres la kiranya , but my Uncle just ignore them and smartly manage his finances.   I also must learn to control my spending, and manage my money well or else my earnings would practically just go down the drain.

       A Lesson Learnt   Discovered a new blog today,  urlLink http://pakwattan.blogdrive.com  by blog-hopping and found what I've been looking for. What I'm looking for? I'm looking for practical advices & tips for starting up and maintaining small business. Some people might wonder why a teenager like me so interested in business - no, I don't study economics nor my father is a businessman either (although he do manage NGOs like a business).   I'm pretty much a very, very small (in term of capital) businessman doing web designs. Somebody always reminds me, start small, but think big. But how do I grow bigger when I don't have a single clue how to maintain this small business? So, have to ask & learn from an experienced sifoo.       PERLU DI INGAT  Apa yang penting di ingat: 1.	penyusunan dan pengurusan fail yang baik, update fail selalu memudahkan segala pengurusan kita dengan pelangan.      Even  urlLink Pak Wattan's  first rule I didn't comply. :P My client's info and project log are practically strewn all over the place - real bad... Good thing must be done at once so I quickly gather all the info and project log from those stick notes, diary and PDA. Then, just make a form in Microsoft Words and enter all the info and project log.  Haa... Only now I can clearly see what's going on with my project and how fast (or how slow) I've been going so far. Now I also could easily hand over the project to other people as all the project info and log is there. Real practical advice, thanks a lot  urlLink Pak Wattan !

       O Boss, Where Art Thou? - Part II    At last... managed to get to know what he's up to. Yesterday I contacted his personal aide who hold his handphone and told him that there's urgent matter regarding the website. Poor boss, he's actually not been very well and had been given 1 month MC.Hmm, even heading his own company he still ask for MC from he doctor. His personal aide, Mr. Z also said they are hiring a full time staff to update & maintain the website and the staff will report duty next week. I have to complete the documentation then. His last known location is in Singapore (had  urlLink any   urlLink of   urlLink you  seen him?) and he'll be back home next Monday. Looks like next week I'll be back into full-swing operation.

       SMS and Some Blog Tweaking   An SMS from a dear friend this afternoon:      Very, very funny and inappropiate. Finish your studies first!  Meanwhile, Blogger had revamped their blogging tool and added some nice new tags such as the recent posts, comments, and profile. Hmm, just added the recent post feature. For comments I'll still use Haloscan. I've changed some of the links and add a few new blog. Take a look for yourself. :)  Planned to write about my trip to Kuching but I'm just plain lazy. :P Have to brush up client's website here so that made me a bit busy. Anyway I promise to write part of the trip especially the  'naik sampan'  part.

       Known Thru Blog   Recently on Saturday I attended a talk by Prof. Dr. Sidek Baba at IIUM Indera Mahkota campus. The talk, which is part of a seminar is organized by  urlLink PKPIM . On the way to the lecture hall I took the stair up when there's a brother there grinning at me. Once I reached upstairs he asked me, "Do you know who I am?" That made me puzzled, he's definitely not one of the Medical or Pharmacy student here. So I just answer honestly I didn't know. "I'm the one who emailed you a few days back after visiting your blog." Well, well. A nice suprise, someone do recognize me on the street after visiting my blog. :D The brother is Azwiral Bukhairi, VP of PKPIM. We have quick chat before we hear the talk and then he gave his contact card. Looks like we'll keep in touch after this. :)  Back home, I wonder. Should I continue to put my picture here? Or should I not? So far I don't see any harm doing that as I see it as a way that my long lost friends could recognize and find me. My blog posting also 'clean', no content that will offend anyone, and there's no posting that go way down to my heart feeling either. The latter could invade my privacy if I do, as some other fellow blogger learnt it the hard way.

       My Uncle's Wedding   0800 - We started our journey to Mentakab from Kuantan for women's side reception. We didn't attend the  akad nikah  the night before as my mum just get back from Singapore.   1030 - Arrived at Bukit Bendera Resort, Mentakab. All of mum's sibling and their family is already there except for Pak Teh Fuad who's working at Labuan. The nine families put up in ten rooms but it's still a bit too cramped for all of us. I had a late breakfast at one of the rooms and have some chat with my uncles and aunties. Meanwhile, my cousins are enjoying themselves at swimming pool.  How about the bridegroom? Heh, he's having a quick nap. The bride is at her parent's house.  1200 - Check out from hotel. We make our move to  rumah bersanggar  near the bride's house.  Rumah  bersanggar is usually a neighbour or relative house where the bridegroom will prepare himself for the bersanding ceremony. While waiting for the rest of our 'batallion' to come I took the oppurtunity to chat and update with two fellow family tech heads - Brother Norman and Jamil.      Last Minute Touch Up    urlLink  Visit   the Photographer in the picture      My Uncle - Grinning Happily On His Wedding Day  1300 - The bridegroom and his family members paraded towards the bride's house. Upon reaching the bride's house compound the bride came out of her house before the couple walks side by side into the house for the bersanding ceremony. The ceremony took about half an hour. After that is a photo session before the couple have their first lunch together as husband and wife.   1430 - We head back home. Plan had already laid for the man's side reception which is scheduled for end of this month at my grandmother's house at Pagoh, Muar, Johor.     The Couple in Royal Yellow

      Man, it's already the third week I'm at this Matriculation Center. Time sure flies at supersonic speed these days. Yesterday the timetable for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics came out - each carry 5 contact hours so all together that's a good 15 hours of class added to my timetable. I'm placed in Group 27 - the first Engineering Group together with Adnan, which I've mentioned before as a fluent English spekaer. He speaks coolly like an English gentlemen while another fellow by the name of Amir Hanif speaks like those easy going Australians, complete with lots of hillarious jokes.  Also got the timetable for FKM (Fundamental Knowledge for Muslim) class timetable which is just 3 hours of class per week. The only missing part of my timetable now is computer class. The timetable is out, but there's no grouping information, so how could I attend the class?  The first class I attended this week is Chemistry. The lecturer is Madam Suzilawati Hamzah. Nothing much for except for the rough outline of the course, taaruf (getting to know each other), AND the date of Mid-Semester Examination which falls on 5th of August from 8am to 10am. Anyway, it's good to know the exam date.  Next is the Arabic Class at room S3011, which is pretty much one of the far flung corner of the campus. The class is from 5pm to 7pm, what a time to study language but then better than having night class. Fortunately, the teacher is an energetic one - Ustaz Hassan Hajjaj which came all the way from Egypt. Our seniors said that having Arabic class with foreigner could be hard but we don't see much problem. True enough, language would be a barrier as he speaks mostly Arabic interwined with English and Malay but because most of the people in my class have basic in Arabic, we already started conversing in Arabic with the ustaz in the very first hour of our lesson.   Speaking of basic in Arabic, the ustaz did ask us how many years we had studied Arabic before. Most answered three (PMR level) including myself while a few others had studied for 4 & 5 years. Only two of us had no basic at all. Then the ustaz said in mock disbelief, "You all had studied Arabic for 3, 4 & 5 years and you are still in this Elementary Arabic class? Masya-Allah~" We just replied with our sheepish grin.  The ustaz also have a good sense of humour, read on...  Ustaz: What is that in Arabic? (Pointing to a book).  Class: Kitab  Ustaz: OK, good. How do you say my book in Arabic?  Class: Kitabi.  Ustaz: Very good, what's that in Arabic? (Pointing to the door)  Class: Babun. (Some of us started giggling already)  Ustaz: How do you say my door in Arabic then?  Class: B*bi (The whole class broke into laughter).  Note: B*bi (babi) means pig in Malay.

      Alhamdulillah, I've passed the speaking test yesterday. Just checked out the result at Admission & Records so there won't be any English classes for me here until Year 1 degree programme. But have to keep practicing anyway to maintain my proficiency level (Read: Blogging).   Thanks a lot to all my English Teachers especially Mrs. Wong Bee Bee, Miss Kong Lan Yin, and Pn. Liza Dahlia. My parents, uncles, and aunties. Also thanks to fellow bloggers who made me keep blogging and practicing. Special thanks to all 3G 2001 classmates, you guys rocks! Last but not least to people whom I practiced talking in English.  Heh, sounds like an artist after receiving an award but I do owe them a lot as passing the test lessen my workload here. English classes are even held at night here! Now I can concentrate on my core subjects and Arabic.  Speaking of Arabic I already got my schedule for the class. My class would be on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Arabic classes for Engineering course will commence this Friday. Now have to wait for the Sciences subjects schedule. My contact (class attendance) hour is just 26 hours as opposed to those at English and Arabic Level 1 who will have 32 contact hours. The average contact hour at secondary school is 28 hours so I assume I wouldn't be that hectic.  Meanwhile, my neighbour and Form 3 classmate, Fatin had changed course from Engineering to Biological Science. By the way, Faezar - also my Form 3 classmate had also passed the speaking test but she had to do English for Academic Purposes course here for 1 semester as she is doing Medicine and there's no English teacher at Kuantan Campus.  Goodluck also to fellow 3G 2001 classmates doing International Baccalaurete at Kolej Mara Banting such as Azleen, Hasnul Hadi, Azni and Syazana. Most are Medic bound except for Azleen who will be doing Chemical Engineering.  Signing off now,  Wassalam

      For a week we had been subjected to assemblies and moving en masse which is very cumbersome and time wasting. Now, I get to move around on my own and suit my own schedule.   Woke up a bit later than during Taaruf Week but still early enough to reach the mosque before Azan Subuh. Read the al-Mathurat to kick off the day before Subuh prayer. Then just after Subuh dua I jog down the hill and do one round at the field in front of my college. Stopping immediately after jogging will just cramp my legs so I just walk leisurely around the field one more time. The air is fresh in the morning not like during the afternoon which is practically chock full of dust particles.   Then breakfast as usual, went to Library and learnt what roughly Mechatronics are which I gladly found not really far off from my understanding (I'll write about it in a few days). Also went to the cyber cafe to complete the online form since I don't want to qeue up long at the Computer Lab tomorrow and the few days after. The afternoon is a bit relaxed as there's no briefing for us to attend.  I also learnt that some of us had changed programme. Mostly from Engineering to Biological Science, Pharmacy & Medicine. 38 secured a place for Medicine while 59 got their place in Pharmacy. Looks like competition would be much stiffer for these would be doctors.    After Asr prayer I head to Admission & Records to chck out the result of English Placement Test and Arabic Placement Test. Alhamdulillah, I'm qualified for the speaking test tomorrow. Once I passed it I'll be exempted from English classes and exams with the exception of MUET. Which in turn would give more free time as English courses have the most contact hour. Thanks a lot to all my English teacher and parents.   As for Arabic I'm placed in the Level 1 class. Not much a problem I suppose as I still remember the basics of Arabic just I'm not good at grammar and essay writing.  Meanwhile tonight I've met my two seniors at school, Brother Azri Nasaruddin and Sister Syaza. Brother Azri had changed his number so no wonder I can't contact him. When I asked for his number he mischiveously sad it out loud together with his name which is more than enough to be heard by the sisters at the table next to us. Pretty much just update him on what happening at SMART and who's who enter UIA with me.  Well, have to get ready for the test tomorrow. Also having course briefing in the morning.

      At last, after almost a week of orientating, tests, and getting to know each other the Taaruf Week came to an end today. The Honorable Guest is Assoc. Prof. Mohd Daud bin Bakar, Deputy Rector of Student Affair and Developement. Other VIPs present are the Dean, Deputy Deans and Senior Officers.  The ceremony kicked off with the arrival of the Honorable Guest and the VIPs. The Honorable Guest came in a MCIIUM black Toyota Unser escorted by a group of big bike riders. You don't read it wrongly, there really are big bike riders with rugged outfit with rock music in the background to match. Then the Honorable Guest accompanied by the Dean, Deputy Deans and the Manager of Taaruf Week, Brother Mohd Saifullah walked to the stage. Three Sisters flanked them on each side while dropping Jasmine flowers to the ground in a line.  As usual, the program starts with the recitation of Ummul Kitab. Then the recitation of glorious words of wisdom from the Quran recited by one of the first year student. He recited Surah Al-Mukminun from Verse 1 to 20. Next is the recitation of Asmaul Husna, the singing of the National Anthem and the Matric Song led by the Commitee Members Choir.    After the songs, came the speeches by the Manager of Taaruf Week, the Dean, and the Honorable Guest. The Honorable Guest quoted a Chinese proverb, "There can't be two dragons in one pond, nor ther can't be two tigers in one mountain." Then he adds, "So seek your niche skills so you can be a dragon on your own pond, and be a tiger in your mountain, and don't just be like small fries." Indeed, it's very true in today competitive job market.  After that is one of the main highlight of the event, which is the Bai'ah or Oath Taking ceremony. The Bai'ah Leader is Md. Khairul Anwar of the Laws programme. The ceremony ran smoothly and precisely like what we had rehearsed before. The loud voice of the Bai'ah Leader inspires a new spirit in us. Then the Bai'ah Leader came up to the stage and handover the Bai'ah scroll to the Honorable Guest.  Another unexpected gimmick came later. Two brothers in KRS uniform came from the back, supposedly been lost in the jungle. One of them carry the other one on his back until they are near the mini podium besides the main stage.   Then they pretend to collapse in front of the main stage before getting up again an walk towards the mini podium where there is faux stone bearing the logo of Taaruf Week which the lettering 'TW' and a green butterfly. One of them tried to pull put the sword embedded in the stome but failed which he finally gave up. Then they pretend to read an inscription at the stone which reads - "The sword can only be pulled out by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mohd Daud bin Bakar". Then the Honorable Guest is invited to the podium to finally pull the sword to mark the end of the Taaruf Week while at the other end a banner tied to balloons rose to the sky.  The VIPs returned to the main stage for a while before leaving the venue for some refreshment. We remain for a while at the field for some announcement. Then we are requested to take out the al-Mathurat from the Taaruf bag and put it in our pocket before us brothers simultaneously threw the bag as high as we could in the air and catch it back followed by the sisters. Then the final show is the particle wave motion done by all of us at the field, and that marks the very end of the Taaruf Week.  Thanks a lot to all commitee members, the Dean, Deputy Deans and Senior Officers for making this Taaruf Week a memorable event in our life.

      After a hard day of two tests and an aerobic session came the highly anticipated opening ceremony. The event starts after Maghrib prayer and was held at the field as the Al-Malik Faisal Hall is simply too small to accomodate us all.  Sisters sit at the right side of the field while the Brothers at the other side. We sat on the mat provided in our Taaruf Kit. We were arranged in grids and even the placement of our sling bag was uniformed to give a streamlined look. Although the ceremony was held at the field it was quite comfortable with the cool weather. High powered spotlights bathed the field with white light and you can easily read any text.  The program starts with the arrival of Prof. Dr Ismawi Hj. Zen, Acting Deputy Rector of Planning and Developement accompanied by the Dean of Matriculation Centre, Tn. Hj. Abbas. Their escorts are martial artist from Seni Silat Cekak Society. Then the recitation of Ummul Kitab followed by silat performance from the escorts. Then one of the senior recites Surah Al-Hujurat from verse 6 to 13 which he recites beautifully while the translation is projected by two LCD projector at either side of the field. Then we recites the Asma al-Husna, followed by the sining of the National Anthem and the Matric Song led by a group of our seniors.  Next came the speeches. First is from the Director of the Taaruf Week, Bro. Mohd Suffian. Seondly is by the Dean of MCIIUM, Tn. Hj. Abbas. Last but not least is official speech by the night honorable guest Prof. Dr. Ismawi Hj. Zen.  The highlight of the event is the officiating ceremony which is mostly a highly coreographed drama. First, the lights at the field went out giving an air of suspense to all of us. A narrator at the back stage tells the story of Malacca in it's glory days. Then came a group of students dressing as Arabs meeting a group of Malaccan Malay warriors. The Arabs spoke to the Malays in Arabic (what else?) but the ironically the Malays replied in English. The Arabs requested to meet the Sultan for a highly important matter but the warriors disallow beacuse the Sultan is having a conference. True to their nature, the Arabs insisted which include a babling in Arabic and after a few times being refused they just stormed off to the main stage to meet the Sultan - Prof. Dr. Ismawi Hj. Zen. The Malay warriors get to the front of the stage and explained what has happened.  Then he is invited to the mini podium. Then starts a coreographed move by senior Brothers and Sisters. They walked in pairs, each bring a candle light and lined up at either side of the centre lane while another group of Brothers and Sisters holding red lanters flanked the field. Starting from the back of the field each pair motioned the oil lamps at each other before putting it at the post by the side of the center lane. Then they walked out in pairs from the front of the field heading to the back.  Then a model of a 'batu bersurat' bearing the name of Taaruf Week is lighted up and rotated. Then the the Honorable Guests are invited to sit in front of us for a multimedia presentation which is deemed very impressive. To emphasize that the world is filled with lies it even include the 'Tipah Tertipu' dialogue. Most of the soundtracks used are from Linkin Park. Then the Honorable Guests return to the stage before the closing dua'. Then they walked out of the field thru center lane for some refreshment. Only then we head backt our respective residential colleges in orderly manner.  Typing off, Wassalam.

      Today is the exam day. English Placement Test and Arabic Placement test. English Placement Test is tougher than SPM but for essay you are only limited to 350 words. It covers Error Identification, Completing the Text, Comprehension and Essay.  As for Arabic Placement Test, there are two type of paper. One is for students with no basic which only took 30 minutes while the other one is a two-hour paper. As the list indicates that I'm a non-Arabic student, I answered the 30 minutes paper which is really simple like what I've learned during primary school.  Tonight event would be the Opening Caremony officiated by Prof. Ismawi Zen, Deputy Rector for Developement. Tomorrow would be filled with briefings.

      For today there's nothing much except for the Fardhu Ain Test, Campus Tour and phtoography session for Matric Card. Te Fardhu Ain Test comprises four sections - Aqidah, Ibadah, Akhlak, & Quran recitation. The test was done orally taking around 10 minutes. I've passed the test and would go stright for Halaqah and won't be sitting any exam.  Meanwhile,got to know a few others. The Kelantanese is Naufal Hakimi, his thick Kelantanese dialect was hard for my other two roommates to comprehend so I hope he could imprive on that. An interesting guy I've met today is Adnan from Port Dickson, Negri Sembilan. We had a conversation in English before Asar prayer. He is interested in Chemical Engineering.  I also met Ashraf from SM Al-Ihsan, whom I've met before last year. Then the others I get to know is Afiq from MRSM Jasin, Muhyiddin from Bangi and the Shahri AF look-alike from Penang named Hanif.  Also noticed Asmaa, my form 3 classmate who just registered today.   OK, that's all. Had to prepare for Englisg and Arabic Placement Test tomorrow. The outcome will determine how long my study here. Wish me luck!

      Most people entering college or university would just bring a few bags of belonging. But I bring truckload of stuffs - a 3-tonne truck for that matter. Of course, it would be utterly insane to bring such a lot of things to the university. I just bring a few bags of belonging to the university while the rest of it will go to our 'forward base' a.k.a old house at Keramat, KL. Why we do this? Dad is doing consultancy job in KL each week and putting up at hotel each time would be boring. On weekends I'll get to do my laundry and do my work. But then, this privilege came with a responsbility. And this house in KL is bigger than our current resident in Kuantan but I have to single handedly maintain the house. (But of course, some of the big matters is to be taken care of by my uncle).  I'm blogging from my room in IIUM Matriculation Centre,Petaling Jaya. I'm placed at the Umar al-Khattab College in a room shared by for people. I already got acquainted with two ofmy roommates, both of them from Selangor - Mahyuddin and Ashraf. The other one is Kelantanese, but we still didn't get to know his name yet. All of my roommate is doing Engineering. Mahyuddin is interested in Mechatronics like me while Ashraf is more inclined towards Biotech. The room condition is ok and quite well-maintained.   Well, got to go now. Have a briefing tonight on Language Proficiency Requirement at the al-Malik Faisal Hall.

      In conjuction of my entry to Mactriculation Centre, IIUM I decided to change the template which I think is very pleasant to look at. Also resized the Friends & Sifoos pictures so it will be nicer. Don't worry, I'll still blog regularly. With advances in technology, I don't even need to find a Cyber Cafe to post. Now I can post direct from my phone. OK, have a lot of things to pack (I means A LOT!). See you folks next week. :)

      Arabic Language subject now is confirmed to carry credit hours. My course, Elementary Arabic Language Part 1 will carry 2 credit hour. So now Arabic will affect the CGPA. It doesn't matter much to me as I have basic in Arabic and I mostly revising what I've learned for PMR level. Insya-Allah, I would be able to score in Arabic.   Halaqah grouping is out too, I'm assigned to group IB55. The Naqib is Bro. Mohd Hafis from Economics Programme. Halaqah session will commence this Friday and the attendance will contribute to  urlLink FKM  mark.   Quite busy with tests this week namely for Mathematics and Chemistry while Physics is scheduled next Monday. Today it's already one month I've been a student of Matriculation Centre IIUM and so far it had been good. Lots of new friends and things to learn.   Heh, check out some of my friends pictures below:       Is it Arif? Or is it Arifah?    Note: This is not me nor my father.        Is it Amir? Or is it Amirah?

      Some of you wight wonder, what does it means by 'Blog Wirelessly' that I wrote at the side bar? No, I don't use a Notebook to post my ramblings, there's no wireless network at MCIIUM even. The answer? See below:     A combination of Nokia 3650 and Palm Wireless Keyboard, that's it. =) Officially Nokia 3650 doesn't support any keyboard right out of the box. But a little venturing of the  urlLink internet  told me enough to make this setup possible.   Although a foldable keyboard, the keys are very comfortable. It even surpass the feel of most PC and notebook keyboards. So, this solution made blogging, email and lengthy note taking possible. I also upload picture from the phone to my  urlLink photoblog .  The cost of one post? RM0.20 (1 minute over Celcom dial-up [Biz package]), cheaper than calling everybody to update them what's I'm up to. My, it cost the same as an SMS to non-Celcom number. So, in my humble opinion this is a cost-effective solution.  Happy Blogging to all, no matter what method you use.

      I'm glad to announce that today I've created two new blog. Each created for a different purpose (of course, what else?).   The first blog is  urlLink FKM 1113 , dedicated to share notes from the Fundamental Knowledge for Muslims: Introduction to Islam course I'm taking this semester. Although just in form of short notes, I hope many would be able to benefit from it.  Second blog is  urlLink Tinta Ibnu Ariff , created solely to practice my native language in writing. Now I realize that it is my Malay Language which is getting rustier because the use of dialects and slangs. Not to mention of my own preference to communicate in English at times and the use of English as first language here in MCIIUM to top it of. Insya-Allah, this would be a good 'Anti-Rust' treatment and hopefully would maintain my edge in Bahasa Melayu.  Surf these two new blogs at:   urlLink http://www.ibnuariff.com/fkm    urlLink http://www.ibnuariff.com/tinta

      Venue: Main Hall, Cultural Activity Centre, IIUM Gombak Campus  Time: 8-11pm  Program:  Intellectual Fest Closing by Acting Rector, Prof. Ismawi bin Hj. Zen.  Dinner  Performances:  Tan Sri SM Salim  Apa Nak Jadi  Dulu Lain Sekarang Lain  Aikido - This one is awesome, complete with 'human bench' formation. An impressive feat to hold up to three people on the 'human bench'.  Silat - 'Parang' duel! Sparks of fire emitted when the 'parangs' clashed. From Persatuan Seni Silat Gayung.  International Performance by Students from Djibouti - Three traditional dance with African and Arabic influences.   In-team  Ajibtu  Halimatus Saadiah (New Song)  Kalimah Cinta     Sorry for the sparse posting, a bit busy with assignments and all that but at least there's a rough idea of what going on. Although our matriculation programme is quite pact with all those university required course such as English, Arabic, FKM (Fundamental Knowledge for Muslims) and Computer we do have many interesting activities going on. Much to the envy of our friends in KPM Matriculation Centre.   By the way, we also had Forum Bicara ad-Deen last Wednesday at al-Malik Faisal Hall, Matriculation Centre in collabration with IKIM.fm - the topic is "Generasi Muda Islam Menggalas Harapan". The panelist are Ustaz Wan Sohor, our very own Arabic lecturer and Ustaz Mohd Zamri, an IIUM graduate. We also had performance by De'Hearty.  Well, that's it for today. Will blog again later.

      No, I'm not on a strike like Wawa & Tok Rimau. There's been no update because I'm quite busy with many things such as quizzes, tests, exams, meeting & workshops. Plus I have to empty my room because MCIIUM is the host of IPTIM Sports Carnival starting this weekend. It's quite tedious to haul all of the heavy stuffs back to our house in KL but Alhamdulillah my friend borrowed his dad car so I don't have to bring my two big luggage bag using the LRT. That was on the recent Saturday, and thanks a lot to Farid who drove all the way to my house in Keramat and then head back to Bangi. The car is an old manual Volvo and KL traffic was heavy that day so you can imagine how tedious it is for him to drive that day. Man, buying him lunch and paying for the toll that day is still not enough for his tremendous help. I do have a good time that with the three Bangi boys which is Farid, Adil and Zaki. Adil and Zaki kept us entertained all the way wading through the traffic jam with their superb vocals singing out songs composed by themselves and currently popular songs. (Mostly nasyids, Adil and Zaki is member of their school nasyid group, Al-Madani of SMK Jalan Tiga, Bangi) Plus Afiq (Labu) from Keramat who joined us for lunch at Setiawangsa at a food court in front of my former school, S.K Taman Setiawangsa.   On the recent Saturday and the Saturday before is the Saturday Series Soft Skills Workshop. On the first week is Communication Skills with one of the speaker is Miss Hafidah Samat, Entertainment Journalist from NST. Then the second week is on Personality Assesment, which the speaker is Mr. Ahmad Zaki Zafaai, a consultant. He's an IIUM graduate from the IRK (Islamic Revealed Knowledge) in Tafsir, minor in Psychology. We are quite suprised when he said he's an IRK graduate, since he doesn't look or act like one.  On the recent Saturday is also the first Arabic Test at Al-Malik Faisal Hall. Fairly easy, I got 19.5 over 20. That is mostly because I've learned at school before so here I'm pretty much just re-remember all those stuffs. The next test is on 11 September, which promise to be much more challenging than the recent one. (The date itself signifies something very challenging)  This week will be full of quizzes and test. This morning is the Chemistry Quiz, Wednesday is Maths Quiz, Thursday will be FKM Quiz and Chemistry Mid-Semester Examination. Lastly on Friday night is Computer Mid-Semester Examination. So don't expect any updates until Friday. Then after this hectic week is the Mid-Semester break for a week but surely there's assignments to do. So most probably I'll finish all my tasks here before going back to Kuantan so I can fully relax and enjoy myself. (That's what I think and wish for, but I do feel there's some task waiting back in Kuantan)  Well, that's it for now and also welcome back to college for my friends at KPM Matriculation Collegess, wishing all of you a new, refreshed, high spirit to strive for excellence.   Knowledge, Compassion, Smart
