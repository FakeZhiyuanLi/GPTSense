Contact No. 9845114070 E-mail Id. raghu_mr2@hotmail.com  Objective:   My long cherished aspiration has been to achieve enhanced work specialization through consistent, Prompted by a strong technical background and reinforced by practical thinking, I now look forward to a perspective industry in the field of Embedded Electronics Engineering.   Summary:   ·C, C++, C pointers, and data structures. ·Assembly language Intel’s 8085, 8086, and MCS-51. ·embedded system designing and development. ·Networking protocols like TCP/IP, I2C, CAN, and RS232. ·Learning Japanese for level-4 JLPT exam.                 Working Experience    ·July 02 to Aug 03 worked as microcontroller trainee at ISM. ·Aug 2003 to till date working in IPA flowmatics banglore as R&D engineer.  Details Of The Academic Worked On     Sigma-delta modulation  Description:  The project is about doing a detailed level R&D on some latest technologies, doing a proof of concept, developing a compressed audio. This is a technique of modulation wherein the base band voice signals are being scaled with their previous signal level and the error will be sent to the destination. This can be further reprocessed to get back the original signal.  Role description: designing and development of software on digital signal processing Matlab.  Team Size                    :           4 Duration                     :           3 MONTHS Technologies                 :           MATLAB.    Remote RF energy metering  Description:  [The same concept has been implemented by BWSSB of banglore recently]. In our project the electrical meter person can go to an area and can get the reading of the house under only one press of a button, which may take few milliseconds, with this rate he will be able to read meters of the whole area in a single day. In the project the antenna transmits the number of the meter using DTMF codec, which is modulated and will be received by the help of a receiver at the station and decodes the number, in the same procedure re-transmits the reading.  Role description           :           Designing and interfacing of 8255 to pc through ESA slot  Team Size                  :           2 Duration                   :           6 MONTHS Technologies               :           DTMF, Radio communication.   Hardware Lock   Description: In our project there is a lock, which is mandatory key for highly secured systems. This will be a genX System lock to operate on any highly secured servers/systems.  Role description: Designing and interfacing with 8051 [The code was written on keil c].  Company                   :          Indian Service Machine. Team Size                 :          2  Duration                  :          1 month Technologies              :          RS-232, 8051, I2C-rom.     Current projects:   Ø      Writing LCD driver for all the existing controllers through Embedded c. Ø      Flow controller system.  Description:   This is an exclusive system, which produces pulse for particular amount of flow.  Each pulse is recorded and for particular amount of flow the corresponding number of pulses is set. When that number of pulses are cycled the system will stop flowing.  Role description: Designing and development of system on Atmel’s 2051.  Company                     :           IPA Flowmatics. Team Size                   :           1 Duration                    :           2 month Technologies                :           Embedded controller.  Software Exposure:  Languages: C, MATLAB and assembly coding.  Operating Systems: UNIX, WIN 98/ME/xp, and MS-DOS.    Education Details:   B.E:  Bachelor of engineering in Electronics and communication  First class with 68% from the college Golden Valley Institute of Technology affiliated to Visveswaraiah Technological University, Belgaum in the year-02.
