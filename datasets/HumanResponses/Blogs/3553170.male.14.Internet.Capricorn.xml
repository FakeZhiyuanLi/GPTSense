        I was born long ago 
I am the chosen I'm the one 
I have come to save the day 
And I won't leave until I'm done 
So that's why you've got to try 
You got to breath and have some fun 
Though I'm not paid I play this game 
And I won't stop until I'm done 

But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way? 
And I got to got to know 

I don't know why we always cry 
This we must leave and get undone 
We must engage and rearrange 
And turn this planet back to one 
So tell me why we got to die 
And kill each other one by one 
We've got to love and rub-a-dub 
We've got to dance and be in love 

But what I really want to know is 
Are you gonna go my way? 
And I got to got to know 

Are you gonna go my way? 
'Cause baby I got to know 
Yeah

        leaving... and maybe not..... a hard decision.. too be in..
you don't know what's going to happen.... it's almost like being trapped....
you can't add knowledge so instead you think....
I mean imagine a whole life goes through you just like that... and then suddenly your mother tells you that you're going too create another... I that's some serious shit.. to be involved with... I mean just the thought of it is totally terrifying...
whatever... I still got my friends back in denmark.... I mean steffen nicki oliver henrik and all the others.. it may bee that I did not have any success with finding any friends in my new school... but who really care's.. I mean that.. I'm leaving so get over it... but no matter how much I try the memories always come back....
well I only got one more day at School... get through it and thats it.... well  bye bye... bye bye.... 

NEVER TOO RETURN AGAIN.  urlLink

       This Weekend I was at a Karate Camp and I graduated to the second green belt. I had a great time and did't worry about school or anything. Just happy without being to confused. Besides my summer vacation is in two weeks from now. I also took a few pictures of my friends: Mikkel, Oliver henrik mads and ofcourse me the masterpiece. Well we had fun and Oliver told me some sweet jokes, damm they gave a kick out of me and the others of course.

Well see you laTEr, and I am not gonna say Alligator.

done.
