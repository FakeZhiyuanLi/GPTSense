      Bintan. Everytime i say the word my heart skips a beat. I am so in love with the place. We ( Me, Fendy, my best bud, my colleague and Fendy's cuz & her Willie) went there slightly more that a mth ago. Initially i thought that Bintan is so so and the beach is so so, but i was so wrong. When we reach the Villa (Banyu Biru) we were already going ooh and ahh. The villa was gorgeous. It was a two bedroom villa, with a spiral staircase (ooooh..) and with sliding doors all round it. It was gorgeous. And it was only abt 3 minutes away from the beach.   And the beach.. oooooooohh.. the water has 3 tones, the sand white and the seashells were beautiful. It was simply breathtaking.The swimming pools were great as they were rather empty and you can jump in without swimming costume. I am so so in love with the place. I miss it so much. The service was wonderful but the food was ex (e didnt care because the villa has a kitchen..haha). *Sigh* That place was gorgeous. We stayed there for 4 nights and were constantly swimming, either at the beach or the pools. In the evenings, me and Fendy took long walks by the beach and collected seashells. *Sigh* So romantic... *Drifts away to LaLaLand for a while*...  Fendy.. when should we go there again? Should we go there for our honeymoon or should we go to Maldives?   Bintan.. i hope to see you soon.   The villa...

      I was @ Orhard with Fendy & friends when we saw this very drunken guy. He looked abt Siddique's (My bro) age ie. 20. He was swaying and couldnt really walk straight. I felt so strongly that he was drowning his sorrows. I cried because i felt so sad and empathise with him. I dont know why but i really felt so strongly that he had some problems. I felt so bad and guilty about not helping him. So whoever you are, hope you are feeling better and is safe and sound.  I dont know why but this kind of things happens quite often for me. I dont know why but sometimes, when i heard things like ppl breaking up, havings problems etc, i will cry for them. I can just feel their pain. I dont show them when i cry but when they tell me such things, i will go home, get so affected by their pain and will start to cry. I will only feel better after sometime.  Am i weird or am i such a softie? Hrmpphh..

         The Test    Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they pass a trial. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.  The first one came back and said to the king, "I brought ten apples." The king then explained the trial to him. "You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten."  The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed.  The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.  The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, "Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?" The second one replied, "I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples."

      I had a wonderful day with Fendy yesterday. We went to the airport to enjoy the aircon, then moved on to Simei in the evening to the Pasar Malam. It was so nice.   Before i went out him yesterday, i was trying to analyse my feelings for him. I thought i didnt love him as much as i used too. But i was so so wrong, because, when i saw him, my heart soars with love and i so so need to feel his skin and hairs (He is yummily hairy).   So darling, i love you so much, so very much. You just make me so happy and makes me laugh ever so often. I just cant wait for us to get married. Keep dreaming abt marriage, babies and house. *Sigh* Oh Oh! ;p

      I have been having the same kind of dreams the past 2 weeks. It is either about me getting married, me looking for a house with Fendy or me having babies. Weird aint it. Although the dreams are not exactlyunpleasant, it is rather upsetting when you wake and realize that you are not married, no house (still has curfew) and no babies.   One particular dream goes like this..'Me and Fendy were at this house. Initially the house looks small but then there is a long hall which leads to a bigger hall and there is this huge balcony facing the beach. It was simply breathtaking and then it turns out that it is actually two units combined into one. Me and Fendy was so happy'. Then i woke up and realized that was just a dream.  Another one goes like this..' I was at a stadium-like place (dont know for what though) then i saw my youngest brother and he has this baby with him. The baby was okay for a while, then he started screaming his heart out. Everybody was looking at the baby. Then i rushed to the baby to try to pacify him. That was when i realize that that was my son. As everybody was looking at us and whispering to one another, i had to take the baby out. Then all of a sudden, i was alone at the stadium and cradling the baby in my arms. The baby has huge pores'. Then i was awaken by my mum's voice. Weird and scary!  Why do i have these dreams? I really have no idea why i keep dreaming of these things. Do i want these things ie. marriage, babies & house badly? Am i going thru a quarter life crisis (albeit an early one)? Or is my biological clock ticking? Hrmmphh!

      Omi god.. guess what.. i saw my same ex again, on the same day,this time @ Cityhall. I was walking out of the station when i heard somebody shouting to me "Oi, waiting for BF is it?". Gosh and i had to do another 360 degrees turn (always dramatic) and it was him. And i said " You again?" in a very unpleasant tone with a half-grin and then i walk away. But realizing that was rude, i turned, gave him another half-grin and said "Bye!". Blimey, the funny thing was, i was thinking abt him before i saw him. I was just reminiscing the old times. Cheh.. it was like i was caught out. Anyway.. What a Day!

      I was walking towards the laksa stall (best in spore) when i heard somebody calling my name. The person has a deep voice that i cant recognize. I had to do a dramatic 360 degrees turn. It took me abt 30 second to register the face. And when i do, i was speechless. It was my ex, the one who i was with for 4 1/2yrs. Not really an amicable separation though.   Anyway, to continue, i was darn shocked. We went thru the normal conversation long (but not lost)friends (?) make ie. "where are you working", "what are you doing" etc. And as we speak, i keep moving further away from him. It was so weird. I mean, it is like he is somebody i know but yet i dont know. He even sound weird, not like the way he used too or was it because it was too long ago. I almost went up to him to touch his face cause i dont know if it is real. It is totally weird and my mind was so confused. And i did the biggest boo-boo i could do in 2004, i said "Happy Advance Birthday". Stupid aint it, when his Birthday is on 28 June. Stupid, stupid me! Then he asked "Wow you remember ah?". (Of course i do.. firstly i have a gd memory and secondly, Fendy's birthday is on 21 June and another ex of mine is on 26 June) I could feel my face turn red and hot. I just kept quiet and smiled and just walked further. Then i said, "Okie, bubbye!"  Stupid me.... *sigh*.. never knew what i was thinking cause i never expect to bump into him and thus never know what to say. But anyway, after i walk away to my laksa, i managed to get a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Hrmmphh.. oily face, fading lipstick, messy & frizzy hair..nuff said. Wished i had bumped into him in the morning, when i look close to impeccable and presentable. Well, you always meet ppl you dont want to when you are at your worst.

      I wish i am. Getting married tomorrow i mean. But alas.. Fendy is still studying. What to do! I will have to wait. Next year, if god permits. This curfew is killing me.  I don't mind a curfew, hrmmphh, but not every sodding day. I will just have to bear with it then. And be a goody goody girl.   KPK called again today. He is so cute, in a crazy kind of way. Everytime he calls, he makes my day. He is this customer of the place i am working at. I don't even know what he says most of the time but he is wildly entertaining. He asked me (again) if i was the little girl he spoke to. He asked me why i sounded like a little girl. I don't know whether i should be happy or feel insulted. Anyway, he rambled on and then he asked me if i received a respause (is this a new word?). Before i asked him what it was, he said when i do receive a respause (??) then i will be his friend. Then he said happy new year and hung up. What is he, or who is he?   He (KPK) actually called on Monday as well and told me his sister is a saicho(he pronounced the 'cho' as in 'cho-colate'. I was puzzled.. then it turned out he meant his sister is a psycho ie crazy. Duhh.. and he hung up with Happy New Year. Boy he made me laugh..!

Well i am so looking forward to 7pm.. i will be meeting Fendy finally.. aft 1 day of being apart. Hehe.. pathetic arent we?  Anyway.. yesterday i talked to SheeLs and she said she went to Koh Phi Phi tooo. She said it was gorgeous. Hrmphhh... she said you can go to the middle of the bay and the water is only at the waist level and the water is so clear that you can see all the corals and clownfish. *SObs*.. i wanna go there! She also went snorkelling. The boatman brought them to 7 different islands and gave them lunch and only charge them $10. Aint that cheaP? She also said that the plaCe has a nice hippy reggae bar. How wonderful! I am so envious of her. End of the year hopefuLLy!  FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT!FECK IT! *sObs* FendY just told me he cant meet me today as he knock off at 10pm.

      After one week of trying to find a plaCe to sit @ Hitachi Tower basemt during lunch time for my LaKsa.. i almost gave up. But today.. i managed to dig into the laKsa. It was as superb as ever. It was hot and spicy and there is fishball, shredded chicken, taupok and half an egg. Trust me.. you can never find a better laKsa. FYI, it is @ Mirana Nasi Padang (yes it is halal-certified by MUIS!). Must try. You will weep and sweat and fight over the seats but it is so worth it. Hehe.. will bring Fendy's sis there. Oh yeah and remember.. if you wanna try, must come between 11-1.30pm cos sometimes it will sell out fast.

      I was late just now.. (Cos i read my storybook after my shower!).. so i decided to take a cab. The sickening cabbie went by ECP and chose to be in the sloweST possibLe lane.... Cheh.. then i asked him to exit near Suntec and he made one helluva big turn.. then went by North Bridge Rd (my instructions!). I think he noticed me looking @ my watch and knew i was late. He asked me what time i start and i told him that i start at 9pm. It was 9.03. He got the cheek to say.. "Late a bit nevermind right!" Cheh.. if i lose my job will he support me? I just kept mum and tried to look fierce. Then when we reached the building, i asked for the fee. He said it is $12.. but i saw the fee on the meter was $12.70. I believe he feels bad and that proves that he is GUILTY. Hrmphh.. i cant std such cabbies.

      Fendy had something on the left side of his face since last week. At first it looked like a rock pimple.. then it started to look like chicken poX. I panicked as Shahrukh had gotten chicken PoX and dont want my poor Fendy to get it. His siS said it wasnt chicken poX but pimple but my muM said it iS chicken PoX. LucKily the thinGy burst yesterday and puS & blood flooded Out (disgusting!) and we found out it was chicKen PorK aKa ROCK Pimple. Haha.. so relieVed. ;p

      My weekend was slow.. very slow..! I didnt see Fendy on Saturday cos we had a misunderstdg. Cheh.. that was the very first Saturday in so many months when i staYed at home on Saturday. Even my parents were surprised.   But well.. i stayed in my room and slept and read my books. Slow.. but wonderful. Then at abt 8.30pm, my mummy asked me if i wanted to eat dinner with her and dad. I said no as i was lazy. Then my dad asked me what i want to eat so they will get it for me. In the end, i asked my mum if she wanted to go to East Coast Lagoon. Surprisingly. they agreed, even though it was a Saturday and it was damn hard to get a parking space. Anyway.. the food was nice and so was the ambience but a bit the geli with the catherines. Hehe... but nevertheless... what nice parents i have. So grateful for them. Though they may be ruthless at times (boy am i exaggerating!), they can be wonderful most of the times. c",)   Sunday was nice... Fendy's friends surprised him with a cake and pressies. Actually me and Fendy was at ECP, having a gorgeous time listening to the CDs. Then we went to Tampines as his friends couldnt go to ECP. We waited for them at McDonalds but a xiao liao cat came and me & Fendy moved to BK. But i saw his friends. Thank god they hid behind a wall. (Honey.. whenever it is ur birthday.. either my friends(last yr) or your friends have to play Hide n Seek with you! Cheh!) Then i told Fendy i wanted to go to McDonalds back, and voila.. there was a cake and lighted candles on it. I can see Fendy was touched... He is so lucKy to have such wonderful friends. c",) They assisted (tremendously) in surprising him last yr too! (Together with my Darling SheeLs) BTW..Honey... ur pressie will be delaYed okie.. so sorry!

      Ignore the BLOG below.. hehe.. i think i am having a quarter-life crisis.. *sigh*. Getting older. What to do! But it is okie as i still look like i am 21! (Although that is in an unrealistic world!)   Anyway.. yesterday me and Fendy went to Tampines again. And the durians smell so nice. That is so weird.. considering the fact that i dont eat durians as they stink! Hmm..maybe i am really having a premature quarter-life crisis.   I spent the day beating Fendy and getting tickled by him. How fun! HeHe!

      Is there something wrong with me? Why do so many people dislike or hate me? I feel that so strongly. Do i have attitude problem or they just find me irritating? I dont know. I wish i know. Boy.. i sooo feel down. *Sobs* Am i so bad? Am i so god awful? Am i such a worthless person? *Sob* What did i do? Is it the way i talk? Or the words i say? Or am i such a boring and nagging bitch? Or is it because i am so unpredictable with my temper? Hrmmpph... i hope i will get through life. *Sobs*   Why am i so unhappy?.. hrmphh... Or rather.. why am i so unhappy at one moment and happy at another? I am a walking contradiction. Is that why? Is that why? Is that why? I am never contented. I am so complex that i dont know what i want! Hrmph.. Answerssss.. i need answersss!  Why am i so useless? Why? I cant even sort myself financially. Why? Why am i such a loser? Why am i so pathetic? Why am i so disgustingly undisciplined? Why am i so weaK? Hrmpph...!

      Oooh.. i forgot to mention that me and Fendy went to My Soup Meal @ Simei on Thursday for dinner. I ordered Rosemary Grilled Chicken. It came with cheese rice and on top of that you can choose to have either beef goulash, creme of mushroom or clam chowder. I chose clam chowder while Fendy chose creme of mushroom. Fendy also order a burger. Fendy's burger was nice but the Rosemary Grilled Chicken.. oohh.. it is like having an orgasm with your mouth. It was wonder wonderful.. the chicked was juicy and the sauce was ooooh.. orgasmic. The cheese rice was wonderful too, with green and red pepper. It is so delectable.. the different flavors and textures playing on your tongue. Our bill.. $10.90. Unbelievable aint it. You gotta try it.

      Me & Fendy celebrated our 2 yr anniversary on Friday 11/06. Two years together.. how time flies. *Smiles* Anyway, we went to airport in the afternoon (his studio was cancelled!haha) and ate nasi bukhari @ T1. It was wonderful. After that we went to T2 and sat at the viewing mall amidst all the chaos and running monsters. How unromantic.. hehe! Then Fendy could not take the BO of the nonya beside him anymore.. so we decided to get ourselves an ice cream from Swensens. But before that.. we had an argument.. i guess Fendy was kinda bored and sleepy ( actually me too!) and we were like kinda sad that we are 'celebrating our anniversary' like this. But anyway we got ourselves a sticky chewy chocolate cone, ensconced ourselves somewhere hidden and hahaa.. the rest is between us.  After that, we decided to go to Tampines cos that was where we had our first date. We ate takoyaki and $3 pizza from the Pasar Malam then sat behind Tampines Mall. We recalled sitting at the exact spot on our first that. Then we went to KFC and sat at the exact same spot we sat at on our first date as well. And talked abt what happened and how our lives changed. Fendy said something touching.. he said.. now he could feed me and 2years ago he couldnt as we werent together yet. After filling ourselves and reminiscing, we went to sit outside.. yes at the same spot we sat on our first date and talked and ...! How Wonderful.  I love you so much honey... 2 yrs have done nothing but made me love you more... ! I cant wait to spend the rest of my life with you darling!  As i sat there with you Talking abt the things we want to do I felt so complete And know that you are all that i need  Two years have passed And look where that has left us Still strong together Loving each other more than ever  Although we have our arguments We too have our sweet moments This still feels so right The future seems so bright  I cant wait for that special day When we can be together everyday When you put the ring in my finger And be with me forever

      I went for an interview on Thursday for an Admin Officer Position @ a UK insurance company. It was located in Shenton Way. The place was nice. I had to take a cab there cos i took 10000000 hours to get ready. I thought of wearing a shirt but couldnt button it. Sad huh. I ended up wearing my fav blue tarakucha blouse and my ever there shawl. I was shocked and kinda shaken when i realized there were 3 ppl interviewing me. I mean, this is not the first time i experienced such an interview, but well i just didnt expect it. Anyway, i think i busted the interview. *Sigh* I know i didnt get the job although they said i was a 'Positive' candidate. Woo hey, what is that supposed to mean? 'Positive'.. hmm. Now it is Sunday and no reply yet... so i know the answer.. *sigh*.. have to continue my search...

      Last Sunday was Maslindah's wedding. I am so happy for her. Me and honey reached her place at abt 7.30pm. Cheh.. cos we had an argument.. honey so grumpy lah sometimes and also cos i knocked off at 5.30pm. Anyway, when we reached her place, the wedding is over but she and her new hubby and Sal were waiting for us. Mas was looking so radiant and happy and i saw a side of her that i never see before. She seemed stronger.. hmm.. not that she is weak.. but normally she seems very naive and very soft but when i saw her with Azmi, hmm.. she look so happy and in control. I am so happy for her and it was so cute to see the couple getting a bit lovey dovey albeit shyly. *Sighh..* Congrats my dear Mas. I remember you used to tell me that you wish you would have a guy to love and to love you. Now you have, and may you be happy forever and ever. *smiLes*

I am still at work. Yeah, even at 10.15pm. Sad huh? What to do! Hopefully i will get a reply from the lady from the agency. Need a happier and normal life! Anyway, call volume is very high.. very very busy. *Sigh* Where is my fairy godmother? Where? I need you now.

      SHE is a cousin of my friend. SHE is only 22. SHE has 1 son. We were eating when she suddenly said that SHE want to puke. Then SHE said her ex-husband (who happens to be my primary school classmate!) is at the table beside us. HE is with her 'friend'(who looks like a frigging bapuk). HE is tattooed. HE has gone to prison twice. He beats her. HER 'friend' had persuaded HER to leave HIM when HE was in prison and now the 'friend' has nabbed HIM. SHE said SHE had seen them snogging while THEY went clubbing together (after the divorce). I pity THEM. What will happen to the son when he grows up? What will happen to HER? Oh how i pity THEM! Is it FATE or have THEY brought it upon THEMselves?   I dont know people like them still exist. This is so scary. Sometimes, we are so sheltered that we dont know the other side of the grass. Hrmmph.. May GOD help THEM.

      These poems were written just a mth after i got together with Fendy. We will be celebrating out 2yr anniversary on the 11th of June. (Wow, time passes so fast!)  These words to you i write From the very bottom of my heart So pure and so true Just to tell you how much i love you  You bring me joy that nobody could  As you heal me of my wound You take away all the sadness As you bring into my life lots of happiness  I remember when we first met How, when i saw you, my heart leapt And when i saw your smile My heart just goes wild  I remember that windy night As we kiss under the moonlight By the sea and the sand And how i wish that that night never end  Although we've just been together for a month I dare say i've never had so much fun As we spend more time together As i get to know you better  As 30 days go by For you my heart do cry As i yearn for your touch And for you whom i love so much  I really hope we don't have to part As that would really break my heart With you forever i wanna be From now till eternity  This very rainy morning I lay here waiting for the phone to ring With my book and a hot cup of tea And waiting to tell you how much you mean to me

Then i opened my eyes and.......... omg.. can you believe it.. i slept with the white light on and when i opened my eyes the yellow light was on. And there is no change to the temperature of my air-con... bloodY strange man.. bloody freaky.. i quickly went to my bros' room but still didnt get to sleep. I checked with everybody but they did not switch off the white light and switch on the yellow light for me..... something strange.. in the neighbourhood.. who do you call? DONT KNOW MAN.. hehe   My mum reckons the starter is faulty.. but heLLooo.. faulty only today? Hrmphh.. who.. or what did that? Any answers? If i see another entry in my blog under my name but definitely not done by me then i WILL DEFINITELY faint.. this is eeriE..

       I had a great weekend except for a lil bit of a scary encounter..     &nbsp;   On saturday.. me, fendy and my mummy went to spore expo for the "Pesta Perdagangan". After walking around the hall.. we decided to go home. We sat outside the hall for a while, then we saw a girl crying. My mummy was like saying perhaps she quarelled with her bf. Then as we were walking towards the MRT.. the girl ran to my mum and said "Cik.. jaga kawan saya.. dier pengsan" (auntie take care of my friend.. she fainted)! My mum was scared so i went to the girl. I was abt to touch her hand (1Cm apart onLy!) when i remembered i heard her friend saying something abt "Rasuk" (Possessed) while crying into the phone.&nbsp; The girl look so scary. Her eyes were closed but i can see her eyeballs moving up and down.. and her body including her thighs.. were shaking.. so darn scary. I was so freaked out that i walked quickly back to fendy and my mummy. Just then, the girl came back with some officials and said it is cos of the "kuda kepang". So scary..     &nbsp;   Aft that.. we all went to fendy's school.. as he had booked a studio overnight for his project. Mummy left at ard 7.30pm.. barely 5 mins aft that.. there were fireworks. It was so near.. so beautiful. Poor mummy.. she so wanted to watch it but missed it.&nbsp; We had pizza and I stayed at the studio till 10.30pm..&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I went to meet fendY at his schooL @ abt 9am on sundaY.. he looked so cute and sleepy. hehe.. we went back to his house and laze ard till abt 4 pm.. then we went to tampines and meet up with his friends. We had a nice time. I am so in love with fendy still.. we actually changed our chairs (@ Coffeebean) so that there is no armrest and we can hug each other.. hehe.. SO romantic.&nbsp;   Later i am meeting him as well.. cos we miss each other already.. (YES it is your cue to puKe!) aha. Cant wait to see him.. (yes puke some more dears...)..     &nbsp;   BTw... sobss.. fendy's sis and shahrukh are going away tomorrow. The villains didnt let me have half day.. so i swopped with my colleague and ko at 6pm instead.. Fendy's sis will check in at 6.30pm.. so that means... i have to get a cab..and reach the airport in 30mins.. hopefully i will make it on time.. dang the villains.. hehe..

        Me &amp; Fendy has telepathy.. we always seem to complete each other's sentences and seem to think the same things at the same time.. simply amazing...! Egs.     &nbsp;   1) Place : KFC When : Yesterday     &nbsp;   Me : *Thinking abt buns and hoping Fendy would get buns (i was sitting while Fendy ordered).. comtemplated calling him and asking him to get buns but didnt want to be fussy.. thus didnt do so*     &nbsp;   GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?     &nbsp;   I looked at Fendy carrying the tray and saw 2 buns. Was happy. Fendy said he had never ever in his whole life bought buns.. but yesterday he asked for 1 extra buns.. ISNT THAT AMAZING?     &nbsp;   2) Place : Banquet When : 3 days ago     &nbsp;   Me and Fendy were sitting at banquet and couldnt decide what to eat. Then Fendy said omelette and we looked at each other and said at the same time.. "My Soup Meal".. ISNT THAT AMAZING? hehe..     &nbsp;   Those are just a couple of Egs.. there are many more.. we always call each other at the exact same time..! Telepathy? Connected? Bonded? Only god knows... but like mcdonalds.. "Im loving it!" hehe.     &nbsp;   I am so in love with him.. i know this is musHy.. but i dont care. We seem to have rekindled our flame ever since our argument last week.

      Sunday.. Me & Fendy went to his aunt's chalet @ Downtown East. His mum, sis, nephew, aunts and cousins were there. Had a nice time. We watched this Mly Pontianak movie. Quite scary but the scariest thingy was that the actress was really possessed after the movie. Hrmph.. i ended up sleeping in my brothers' room. Haha.. im a bloody coward and no need to hide that..! oooh yah.. i had an argument with Fendy but we made up. I love him so very much. He means so much to me.  Monday.. I was unwell .. but i went to Fendy's house on Monday and helped him edit his Proposal. (Not to propose to me! but for his school!) We had a wonderful time in the evening as we went to Starbucks and drank Hot Cocoa (With whiP creaM) and talked abt when we first fell in love while holding hands and looking at each other. So in love..  Tuesday.. We went to watch The Day Aft TOmorrow @ Stella Artois Starlight's Cinema even though i was unwell. It was drizzling but we got 1 mat, 1 sarong and 1 fabric mat. Hehe.. the fabric mat was so comfy.. the top part is like blankety while the one on the ground is plastic. Hehe.. we wanted to get an army-like groundsheet but we couldnt find the carrefour hardware+home section at Plaza Singapura. Aft we bought the thingy at Spotlight, we realized that the carrefour hardware+home was at the basemt. Hehe.. nevermind..it was a bloody good buy..we got it for $9.95. The movie was so so..but we had a wonderful romantic time.

      Dang.. i need to seek help. I think i need to do something abt my self-confidence. Hrmphh. Been spending the whole night crying.  Yesterday me and fendy and his friends went to a banghra party @ Full Moon Beach bar. Me and Fendy was okie... until i felt so ugly. There were so many beautiful slim girls there and i felt so horrible. We were lovey dovey.. until i made a joke to Fendy and he just 'jeling' me and i felt horrible. Then he went to the Gents.. and i dont know why.. i just kept picturing that if i were to go outside.. i will see him with another girl or exchanging numbers with them or something. And i actually trust him but i dont trust i am good enough for him. When Fendy came back to the table, he was rather withdrawn and i thought he must have passed by so many gorgeous girls who were dancing and must be thinking what the hell is he doing with somebody fat, ugly and boring. It just keeps running in my head. It was horrendous. And i keep picturing Fendy looking ard for a girl aft i left for hom. It was so disturbing that i left at 12.30am though for once this yr my curfew is 1am. I told Fendy i had to leave and said bye to his friends. But what i did was bad i guess cos when Fendy wanted to send me off, i just walked off. Hrmpph.. what must his friends think of me. I bet they think i am angry with Fendy or something.. but that is not true.. i am angry with myself. I think myself NOT WORTHY of Fendy or for anybody else actually.  And when i got home, Fendy refused to pick up his HP and i did very stupid things. I called one of his friends twice and sms and called another one of his friends, asking him to ask Fendy to pick up the phone. Man.. that was so embarassing. What the fuck was i thinking?  To his friends... i am so sorry. To Fendy.. i am sorry.   But i just feel so horrendous, surrounded by so many beautiful girls... i feel so worthless....... sometimes ppl think i am happy with myself but they are so wrong.. i have 0 self confidence. Totally 0. Even when i am with Fendy's friends and my colleagues, i cant be myself.. cos i keep thinking that ppl must think i am boring, unfunny, unsporting and totally horrendous company. I think i am fucked up. When i go into the MRT.. i keep thinking that ppl say 'Look at this fat ugly girl,why she even bothers to wear make-up and go out of the house.' Hrmphh.. this is my nature. That is why i am also constantly in shawls. It used to be cardigans. When ppl ask me why i keep wearing shawls or cardigans i will tell them that that is my self-confidence. That is true... cos i depend on it to cover myself. God.. i think i need a psychiatrist.  Another thing abt me is that i constantly seek approval from ppl and i think it must be tiring for them. I always want ppl to laugh at my joke and ppl to think i am nice. What the fuck is goddamn wrong with me? Whoever you are, if you are reading this.. you will probably think i am crazy and will stay away from me.

      Haha.. what is microcysts? Well it is the small pimply looking thing that i have on my bloody face.. i thought it was pimple or whiteheads or blackheads but oohh.. they do have a name.. and what a disgusting one too. CHEH!  I went to the pharmacy the other day and was looking for something for my pimply enemies. I was looking through the safe-in-the-pocket and good-enough counter products when this lady (actually shd be girl cos she look 25 years younger than me!)approached me. She told me that what i have is not pimple and is micro-cyst and i dont have a serious problem. (She must be kidding.. i only have my face left..my body is FAT FAT FAT !) Cheh.. anyway she promoted this product and tried it on my hand. It is a cleansing gel. Seems good and she said it can make my micro-cysts (Why the feck do they call it micro when they are quite big!)disappear. As i was running late i told her i will come back to buy it later. I just bought it just now and hope it works. c",) Fancy talking abt pimples n microcysts on a Friday!... ahah..

Hrmph.. yesterday my mum asked me (for the millionth time)when my appt with my gynae wil be. I told her i have to check. Hrmpph.. dont know how long i can hide from her the fact that i didnt go for my last appt! It was supposed to be in Jan but i didnt go. I am sick of my gynae telling me that i have put on weight! SHIT! Wasnt it her who put me on birth control pills and hormone? DANG DANG DANG! I remembered asking her if all those shitty stuff will make me put on weight.. and with saccharine-sweetness she said no. DAMN IT! Now look at my body.. from a constant 51KG (No matter what i eat!) to a .. damn i am too ashamed to reveaL my weiGHt... what shd i do..

      I have nothing against blondes... but this is cute..  A blonde gets on a elevator and a man is standing there and she turned and smiled at him and said; 'Hi.....T.G.I.F.' ' S.H.I.T. ' replied the man 'Excuse me...how rude T.G.I.F.' responded the blonde 'S.H.I.T.' replied that man   'Maybe you don't know what I am saying, T.G.I.F means Thank Goodness It's Friday!' ' You didn't understand me, S.H.I.T .....'Sorry honey, it's Thursday'

      It was a chore to wake up today. After i took my bath, i sat on the bed, covered my legs with my wonderful thermal blanket and read my booK while enjoying the air con. How i wish i didnt have to go to work today, especially since it is statemt week which means.. that a lot of ppl will call to check on their transactions.  Anyway it is already 4.30pm.. wOohOo 1 1/2 hrs to go. Hrmph... shd i meet Fendy or not? Met him yesterday and the days before. Im scared if my dad flare up again. Cheh.. but if i go home also ok. There is plenty of food.. i save money.. and i can use the PC.   Dang.. why do i bloody have to talk abt food. I am so bloated and fat. SHIT.. i think i better do something abt it?  What is the best way to lose weight? Hrmpph.. should i..  1) Start going to the GYM again. With who? 2) Take up kick boxing. Dont know where and dont know if i have the time. 3) Stop eating chox and ice-cream. And stop being happy? 3) Go on a diet of mantou bread. It works the last time. 4) Try 'Thin & Slim Naturally' from GNC. 5) Continue on HerbXXXXX and suffer from life-is-bitter-throat-is-even-more-bitter syndrome. 6) Start taking XenadXXXX again and start having vertigo again. 7) Stop eating altogether and disappear from this planet. 8) Survive on cabbage soups and suffer from constant flatulence. 9) Feast on salads like cows do. I look like one anyway, with big tits and big rear! Haha. 10) Quit my job and ground myself at home without eating. That is possible, as when i extracted my wisdom teeth, i didnt eat for 4 days and lose 5 bloody KG.   Hrmph.. so what do u reckonn i shd do?   COUNTDOWN TO HOME -- 1HR 15MINs...

      Hrmphh.. it is Monday already? I dont feel rested. *siGh*.. anyWay, yesterday me and fenDy didnt go to the beacH but we went to TampiNes. His friends went to watch spiDeY 2 but we didnt. Instead we went to starbucKs and manage to get comfy on the sofas. But it was darn freeZing. Cheh.. esp since we were telling each other gHost stories.. hehe. And we were drinking the strawberries and cream frapuccinO.. so wonderful.. taste like strawberries and cream ice creaM. YummY! Aft that we walked ard and i boughT a earPhoNe. My darLing Fendy help read the speCs and decide which one i shouLd buy! That is the advantage of getting an audio engineer in-training bf. Hehe! c",)  This morning i was listening to the The BeatLes on the way to work. LoveLy.. hopefuLLy the rest of the daY is lovely too. "All You Need is Love" keeps playing on my mind... hrmphh.. later i shd listen to "Across the Universe" too but the Rufus W's version!   OOoh btw.. you shd watch "I am Sam" if you are big Beatles fan.. All the songs are The Beatle's song but sung by Rufus W. Simply wonderful. Actually, you shd watch the movie, even if you dont love the Beatles. It is so moving. I watched it thrice and i cried. Even Fendy cries. c",)

      c",) I am very haPPy.. althouGH i feel a bit guilty. Why? Well....  1) Fendy surprised me with another Diamond ring yesterday. I was eyeing this Diamond and pear-shape Pink Sapphire ring and he bought it for me yesterday even though it is 3/4 of his pay. Thanks darling. This is the 2nd time. i love you but you shoudlnt have.   2) My parents were at the Hyatt weekend in Johor as per normal. I asked for Hum Tum & Tehzeeb VCDS and 'Kueh Rose' and my parents scour the whole place to look it for me.   I am so lucky to have such loving parents and bf. I really... do count my blessings. c",) I love you all. I am happy...  Btw.. they have put up new lamp posts at the carpark in front of my block and wooHoo.. the whole dang place looks like a stadium.. *I feel so safe*.. haha.  Later we will be going for a picnic with Fendy's friends....

      WooHoo.. yesterday i managed to watch "Love ActuaLLy". Fendy had OT but he manage to come on time. HoweVer.. i didnt get to sit with him as i was with SheeLs & Co and Fendy was with his colleague and they are too "paise" to join us. Cheh.. nevertheless.. it was a rather gooD movie. I lurve HugH grant, Colin Firth & Liam NeeSon. There was also this character who plaYed a singer who sang a CHristmas rendition of Love is all around. I think his character added some spice to the moVie. Hehe.   Btw.. BaybeaTs will be bacK sooN. Force Vomit will be perForming on 17/07 (Sat)! Yeah! I lurve them but have never watcHed them live. There was this once (@ Youth Park) when they are supposed to be performing. We couLd see them backstage but i guessed theY were the lasT act or someThing and my curfew was @ 10.30pm. Cheh.. i arGued with FendY cos of that. Now.. i wiLL not miSS this.. not eVen for M&S ButterminTs. HrmppH.

      Before this job.. i thought the most exciting countdown was for New Year. Nuff said.  I am so exhausted. How can so many evil people reside in this earth? The worst thing is that their evil ways led me to hate them. I dont like to hate people! I hope this people will get what they deserve. *sigh*  Why cant this be a perfect world? So many evil people roaming and poisoning the planet. So many people who think they are god or they are more superior than others.  *sigh*  I hope i will have a nice day tomorrow. I cried at work just now cos this dingo was so nasty. To add on to that.. i am stressed and i am having my PMS. I need a new job. DESPERATELY. It doesnt matter if the bank gives me 21 days leave and >4mths bonus. It doesnt matter. *Chemical Bro's "It Doesnt Matter" plays in my mind. I need some happiness. I deserve some happiness. Money is not happiness and cant buy happiness. I need PEACE. I need to feel GOOD. I need to SMILE. I need to be HAPPY. OMG... i think i need to start praying again. But i am having my rasberry ripple week.  I think i will meet SHeels tomorrow and have a nice morning. Evening... if i feel like it.. i will meet Fendy. Fendy... Fendy Fendy.. *sigh*.. dont know what to say. I am down... i am down.. i am so sleepy... i am so stressed. A sense of melancholy has enveloped me. I need a HUG. *sigh*.....

       Once upon a time in TKGS, (actually it was in 1993) a group of girls became friends. There are four of them. They met at an AMP camp actually as they were AMP scholars. They had so much fun together. They went to look at boys. They went into their new school compound before it was even ready. And guess what? They had a binoculars.. so they could look at the TKTECH guys. Cheeky girls! They did a 'survey' and tricked the guys like hell. They had so so much happy times. Then they were joined by 2 other wonderful girls. When they get together, they caused chaos. Hehe. They called ourself TTF.. which means.. Take This Fridays.. cos Friday is their favourite day.. cos..(I shall not say)! The group has a birthday.. 1 October. It was wonderful. They write letters to each other, talk on the phone non-stop and play together. They also cried and share our laughters and tears. They did silly things on buses and they hang ard often. They also set one of their friends up with a guy she likes. They had a strong bond. They were like sisters. Then... one of them did a stupid thing.. she ended her friendship with them.. and regrets it for the rest of her life. She misses them like crazy.. except for the hypocritical virago. She wishes she could turn back the clock and remain friends with them. She went to a picnic held by them once.. but it wasnt the same.. and perhaps it will never be...........  To Haryani, Bibi &amp; Annisaa... i miss you guys.. those wonderful times we had..  i will never ever forget ... those tears and laughters we shared..  i will never forget .. the letters you sent me after our friendship broke up..  i will never forget ..! I did not treasure the friendship... now i only have the memories to treasure. To you guys... i still love you. I miss those times we had together... i could only wish....................

       I was watching fear factor yesterday and saw the list of things that sporean, thais, filipinos etc fear most. I think the sporean list is incorrect.. this is what i think...  I think the GREATEST FEAR Singaporeans seem to have is............. FEAR OF NOT GETTING A SEAT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT.  Ah ah.. and i know a lotta ppl will agree with me. It is so disgusting.. to seem them rushing to the seats like is a matter of life and death. I just cant std their ugly behaviour. And not only when it come to seats. I work @ Raffles Place, so in the morning rush, you will have to queue just to go up the escalator.. and SO MANY ppl actually dont bother to queue. They just crowd ard there and they push you. It is simply disgusting. They dressed like yuppies but even monkeys are more civilised. And ooh yeah.. another problem is the brainless ppl who read their newspaper in a crowded train. Just 2 weeks ago, i was in a darn crowded train, on the way to work, and there was this IDIOT who was sitting and reading his newspaper. If he hadnt read his newspapers, i believe at least 2 ppl could stand there. When more ppl got into the train i tried to move in but he stared at me when i accidentally hit his newspaper. Super brainLess. Brainless would be what you describe the ivies as well. The ivies is the name i give to ppl who lean against the PoLe. I mean.. HELLO.. ppl need to hold on to the pole too. Dang.  Speaking of all these ugly beings...something happened at esplanade on saturday while i was with Fendy and I was furious... I was sitting with Fendy at the seats along esplanade. Then Fendy was thirsty, so he went to buy drinks. This BRAINLESS man came and sat down before i could say anything. I move to my right as there is space so i could save that space for Fendy. And guess what the BRAINLESS man did? He called his son and asked him to sit there. I was furious. When Fendy came back, i moved to my right again and apologized to Fendy, saying that the ppl just came and sat. Fendy, stood up like 2 mins later to check out the ice cream stall and can you believe what happened? The BRAINLESS wife came and sat at that place. Is that horrible or what? Fendy saw that and called me on my HP and i said very loudly... "Can u believe it? Are they bloody stupid or what? That is such disgusting behaviour!". I was so so angry. They are such dingoes.  And most of these ppl are CATHERINES... hrmpph.. what are CATHERINES? well.. ask fendy.. he knows.. hehe.. Well.. i just hope i wont be stuck here for the rest of my life. Cant std these ppl anymore. Even my parents will be migrating in abt 4 yrs. They are thinking of staying in Perth. Shd we move to Greenland Fendy darling?

Spiritual my ass! HAHA... and do u know.. he can eat food from a chinese stall at a FOODSTALL even though there is a muslim food stall. WHAT A FUCKER MAN.   TO SHARUDDIN.... FUCK YOU MAN.
