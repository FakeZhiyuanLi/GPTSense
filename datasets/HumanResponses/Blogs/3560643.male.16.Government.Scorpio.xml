      So I was outside...I was minding my own business just standing in the rain.."don't ask" and all the sudden this ugly green guy walks up and is like "hey man, take me to your leader" so I was like well..His name is God..and I showed him the bible..So he read for a while with me..and then we went to his space ship to tell everyone else about my leader..so while we were telling them about it..The Head Alien of the ship was like Snork waggle be...So I said Bless you..but he really was saying That he wanted me to bow down to him..but I wouldn't do it..So he said Skree do lukino..Which means then I will tickle you..and I was all "ok man go for it" and so he tickled me for a while and finally I was like "hey man, can I go home..its dinner time.." and he was all.." srolo conutraklo durmango tilabo" which means no..So he was tickling me..and all and then he asked if I would bow down to him..so I was all like "no" and so he grabbed what looked like a blow drier but it was really a Goosh avator 3000.."some kind of Vacuum" and he said I will vacuum your whole house until it is SPOTLESS THEN..and so I was all "no..don't do that..with sarcastic emphasis" and so he was cleaning my house and I started to laugh and he was like does this please you silly human? Now that your HOUSE is spotless where will you live? and I was all like.."My room" duh..and so he got all freaked out...and so they left and went back to planet loogy...and then I went inside and took a nap..

Which kinda sucks..Because my mom is in like CLEANING MODE now..So we have to have it clean TONIGHT..oh well..it's not as bad as I am making it out to be I guess! but anyways..I had pizza for dinner..I am so frikkin full!!! not like anyone cares though..but I kinda just add little things like that in to make this blog a little longer..lol I am in the mood to play a lil guitar! I am gonna record maybe some rock this time! I'm in the mood for a good melodic rock mix! I want a drum set also!! So im in the mood for a good concert right now..I love the excitement of being in the crowd and when a break comes up in the song everyone goes nuts..and then the band breaks loose and rocks out as hard as they can..the crowd starts to freak out and jumps all over the place pushing and singing along to the songs of the band..ahh what a sweeet vision! well I am talking to a crap load of people on aim..Cya!!!  I'll write more RIGHT b4 I go to bed maybe! :-D  Music: Underoath-Reinventing your exit Random Thought: What band name should we use?

      So today has been one of the boringest days of my life..Seriously..I got ta talk to Slick and Christa for a little while..but they both left me!!! :-( I am left here alone..just me and my guitar..lol oh well..They will be back! MUHAHAHAHA someday..but anyways..We are getting pizza for dinner from someone from the church..because my mom had knee surgery..So I am thinking about having some kinda surgery next week..lol jk I want to start a band like Blindside or Underoath or Norma Jean..I think itd be the Bomb Diggity yo! Touring around the world..Playing at Cornerstone! Ahh what a dream! One day..One day..:-) It's hard finding people who want to play in a rock band though..Or people who can actually Play or sing for that matter...I just gotta keep on prayin!!! :-D So my room is still a disaster..Maybe even a bigger disaster then before, I might take a picture with my webcam or something and post it on here before I clean it..and then take a after picture and Compare Before and After! haha I am still looking for someone who is as messy as me..:-D One day..lol CONVERSE RULE MAN! I have not found a more comfortable shoe..OR COOL lookin shoe! Converse Rock my Toes off! I have been doing alot of research on that Visible College in Tennessee and I REALLY REALLY want to go..It sucks that I have to wait until possibly the END of next year or 2 years..I think I am gonna go look up that Eagle Rock retreat online and make myself even more EXCITED..lol I wasn't all that excited at first i'll admit for some reason..but now that it's like almost here I am really stoaked! I am really shocked at myself! I didn't expect to continue writing in this BLOG thing..Ok..Joey and Christa..If I slack off for one day..You have to get onto me and make me write a blog! GOT IT? :-P Well I am going to go TRY and clean up this room of mine..I'll post later tonight! Cya  Music: Norma Jean- Memphis Will Be Laid To Rest Random Thought: It's so weird how a peanut butter sandwhich can be so good even as a child up until the day YOU DIE and yet it is prolly the easiest thing to make!!!
