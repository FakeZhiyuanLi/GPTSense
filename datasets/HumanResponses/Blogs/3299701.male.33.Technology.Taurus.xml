      This is the textbook for the class I'm taking. I keeping needing to reference stuff on the site, so I figured I could find it if I mentioned it here.

      Spoke with the CS Graduate Advisor today, and he said it doesn't matter to him whether I'm classified as a graduate or undergraduate student. He gave me the requirements for the grad degree, and suggested I just start taking classes. There's nothing in the system keeping me from taking grad classes, and if there ever is, he'll override it. Whichever list I finish first (undergrad or grad) is the degree I'll get. I then spoke to Fin Aid, and they said as long as I take 6 hours a semester, I can continue to receive my finaid (since it's just a loan). If I were to enroll as a grad student, however, I'll be eligible for another $3000 a year in subsidized load money. I basically have until the end of the month to decide what enrollment status I want for 2004-2005. If I decide to stay an undergrad, Michelle has to send a copy of my degree plan to fin aid. If I decide to enroll as a grad student, I just need to apply to the grad program before June.

      Bush said Al- Qaeda was in Iraq: they weren't, but now they are. Bush said Iraq was an immediate threat to US Citizens: they weren't, but now US soldiers and civilians are being killed on an almost daily basis. I suppose it's only a matter of time before his "prediction" about WMDs will come true as well.

      I'm toying with the idea of setting up an SMTP gateway server on a Linux or Unix platform to catch spam and viruses before they reach the Exchange server. Here's what I've found so far:   urlLink How to configure a Linux mail server with SpamAssassin, MIMEDefang, and sendmail    urlLink Sendmail    urlLink FreeBSD (similar distribution to what sendmail was developed on, so it should be the most stable)    urlLink SpamAssasin    urlLink MIMEDefang

      Wow. How lame is it to post Earthlink's access numbers on your Blog. People keep asking me, and it's annoying to have to dig through their Web site every time, so here they are.
