      uhhhhhhh... I don't know. Brooke got my e-mail... yeah. chatted with her a bit... don't know.  I just don't understand. you think... maybe that's my problem... you think things are going one way, stuff happens, list of possible reasons for stuff happening, then when inquiry is made, nothing is really cleared up. not sure if things actually were going the way you had thought, not sure why stuff happened, not sure what to do, just know that Brooke doesn't feel well. and I'm afraid that it's my fault.  she doesn't want our friendship to change. I don't want our friendship to change. she doesn't want it to be weird, she says she doesn't feel weird. I don't want it to be weird, I don't know how I feel. I still like her, I know that, but I am brought back to the question of fascination... she doesn't want a relationship at this point, ok, that's all well and good but... she doesn't think she feels the same way but she's never thought about it. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...God help me, I think I'm losing again.

      I did it. I just finished writing Brooke; telling her how I felt; laying it all out on the line.  I would rather of done this in person, face to face, but I truly felt that God wanted me to do it now. OH GOD! you are my only hope, my salvation, my King. to You be the glory and honor forever and ever. Amen.

      waiting... waiting for the mail man... or at least the you have new mail signifier on the computer... I'm sure everyone is just busy... at least that's what I'm going to believe for now. habitat was sweet as molassas! of course there are things to improve, but that'll always be the case. I'd have to say that it was a complete success, especially for the first night. but if we can keep the numbers we had tonight, and have that to grow from, that would be sooo sweet. sweet like the swiss chocolate I had yesterday. mmm mmm good!   Johnny was back at work today... it's good that he's back around after his 10 day hiatus south of the mason dixon line. then our boss John was just extra JF today. I don't know what his deal is. Bobeng attributes it to his diabetes. I suppose that's a good reason, but geez! I really need to start making some money on the side. Windy City just doesn't cut it if I want to actually get an apartment. yikes! financial resposibility. oh, it turns out that my parking ticket fine was due yesterday. so I missed out on that, have to pay an extra $10 now. what really bites it is that when my mom called me at work to tell me, I found out she was sick with a massive fever and just getting ready for my dad to come home and take her to the doctor. God bless health insurance! I hope she gets better soon, she seems to have this nasty habit of sickness clinging to her. here's to God breaking that curse!  well hopefully soon I'll now something more. I'm still waiting for some form of enlightenment.

      another day another reason to keep going... had the big true love waits ceremony in youth tonight. everything ended up going really well which is always a good thing. worship was smokin' and everbody seemed in a good mood. after youth we set up for the first night of habitat tommorrow. it took a while for us to get it all together, but it's lookin' quite nice. Alex is doin' a kick ass job with the lights, and the band gets tighter every time they play. once it was all finally set up, we took some time and prayed for everyone there ("the hot seat") it was good, and much needed I think. Handler is quite sick, runnin' a 102 temp earlier in the day, I'm prayin' that he's feeling better tommorrow. hopefully God and those antibiotics he got today will do the trick. ahhh, then Denny's. always a treat. well it was denny's, nuff said.   I still haven't sent in my payment for that stupid parking ticket, it has to be there by Friday! I'll have to spend more and send it overnight or something now. grrrr! got to send in my car payment too! stupid growing up and being responsible thing. I hope that I can do a good job of teaching my kids early to be financially responsible, it only get harder to learn as you get older...   sent off a couple e-mails to people I haven't seen in some time now last night. it was good to hear from them again. I hope that we can do a better job of keeping up with one another again this time. I always enjoy conversation; even if it is over e-mail. then when I do see them again at least I have some idea of what's been happening and we're able to just enjoy each other's presence. both of 'em (girls I've previously had interest in actually) have serious relationships right now. probably headed toward marriage. I'm less sure about one than the other, but both seem to be doing well. it's kind of weird that the last three girls I've liked are all in relationships headed toward marriage. one is gettin' hitched early this summer even! no matter, I'll have my day soon enough. whenever God decides that it's time. Brooke... hmmm... nothing further as of now. I wrote her last night as well, but I haven't heard back. I wish I knew what was going on inside that pretty little head of hers.  looking forward to tommorrow. looking forward to learning more about God and having a deeper relationship with Him. looking forward to ending this post and going to bed.

      ok, so I'm the only one on this blog right now and I've been doing a rather poor job of continuing to add to it... well the Brooke update is quick... it's still peanut butter man! at least I think it's creamy now instead of crunchy... that has to mean it's getting better right? I haven't really talked with her though so it may crunch yet...   I spend too much money! I have to slow down here... save some money for things I really want, or even put it towards paying off my bills in a more rapid time frame. alas... a lass... now that would be nice!  working on a new song, not quite there yet with the lyrics but I think I have a good title for where the song seems to be headed: questions and apologies. maybe I'll just list it as Q&A on the outside of the cd I'll have someday(hopefully by the summer)... and then perhaps the full title can be written out inside... hmmm... ideas, thoughts... we'll see. I realized that I have much more free time than I had previously realized... I believe I should use this time a bit more wisely than I have been up to this point. not that I don't enjoy the time with my friends, but rather than it just being routine for me to "hang out" with them, I would like to spend more time playing/writing music, reading, studying, praying, and even just plain soaking in God. oh man oh man, that would be sooo great!   gotta get my music in order, record a cd, play shows... gotta gotta praise God, live my life as worship... (that should really be listed first!)... lookin' forward to habitat (it's going to be freakin' rad yo) gotta make more money(pay off some bills, save some money, get some more musical and sound equipment) gotta make sure to be attentive to keeping up friendships, can't lose 'em, become distant  aright... God bless any who happen upon this (by the way, if your reading this, you're prolly the only one) so long...

      you know what i hate most of all?  i hate the fact that i don't care about things.  i am too apathetic.  oh well.  i also hate the fact that people just ruin my hopes and dreams.  i have dreams that i will be getting back together with "her," and that everything will be alright.  but i have this friend who thinks other wise and rains on my parade that she doesn't see us together... she tells me this everytime i have a conversation with her.  this angers me.  i give advise to a lot of people, i encourage them and what not... and then in turn they say i am wrong for hoping we get back to the who dating scene. (am i lonely or what?) oh well, what can i do?  basically nothing.  sucks.  and no jeremiah, she doesn't have man parts.hey! at least i don't think about her all the time anymore.  but i do think about her when i am alone (ahem, now!).

      alright... perhaps things are getting better... actually had a somewhat "normal" conversation (or em, chat) tonight. that's a plus. had a good night tonight. free dinner compliments of John Bobeng. (Gino's East is sooo good!) got my ears stretched; thanks Pat. then went to Denny's for coffee with Jeremiah. stupid waiters don't understand that when two people come in, just order coffee, that they want to drink coffee. only two cups, and we were there a good two hours. what kind of crap is that? oh well. looking forward to the Ben Folds show tommorrow night. aaaaaahh shizzle... later yo!

      la la la, yesterday i decided to kick the 'X' off of my msn mesenger...it felt good because i was so pissed. i decided i don't have to take her crap any more, "stand up and shout" (rock star) peace and love....sooner or later

      today was mundane. i hate mondays.  nothing ever good comes out of them.  seems like we all have girl trouble, or maybe lack there of.  i think "she" likes me still but doesn't have the man-parts (figuratively) to admit it.  ah well.  i ain't over her, but hopefully i will be soon.  all this is taking too much of a toll on me.  i mean, i am lonely.  very lonely.  questions arise.  "did she ever love me?" "is i always going to be like this?" "do girls find me attractive"  "if yes, why doesn't someone let me know?!?!?!" ah well.  i am not to answer those. transmission end.

      handler, glad to see you could make it!  well i know you all want to hear what really did happen to me today (long silence...for thinking) oh i know NOTHING!!!!!!!!! still no women in my life, still uncertian if i should count that as a blessing or a curse. still bored out of my gord. i really need to touch someone...uh...mmmmmm...with music. (soooo dirty). hmmm the "X" just signed on lets sit back and watch it get interesting....(moments later)......so far so good....sooner or later its going to get ugly, thats just the way it goes. (more moments later)................. ....."conversations kill"....well the "X" just signed off, amazingly enough i felt no anger from this conversation. she told me she met a guy, now just what does that mean? who gives a flying rat's anus!!! i know it sounds like i'm hurt, but i'm not. she just says alot of stuff that serves no purpose. and i'm spent

      well, well... I am quite satisfied right now; having had a bowl of spaghetios w/franks(plus a little spice) and a wonderful glass of milk.  I really need to discipline myself... I was an hour late for work  again !! ah well... the rest of the day was quite nice actually(as of yet, and I assume nothing less for tonight) I bought a compressor... yes I'm very happy about that.   sometimes... I wonder, how much of a gomer am I really? I think too much, one of these days that will work to my advantage. I just hope it isn't my downfall...  why can't I just leave things well enough alone? we shall see. yes, we shall see.  ttfn  (ta ta for now)

      well.  you know about that conversation?  it was the best thing that could have happened.  we put the past behind and are looking forward, being friends.  though i pine for her, that will have to cool on the back burner.  but it is soooooooo hard.  anywho.  turn about was good.  but i am anti-social, so it was nerve racking.  my "date" is selective-social.  so it was ok.  i think she digs me.  she is one of my X's.  she wanted to dance at all the slow songs... i didn't mind.  she got real close on the last song.... woah.  she looked like she wanted to lock lips... big woah.  i know she ain't the one for me.  i still think "she" is.  kinda funny how we have other names for the girls not in our life.  food for thought: don't go to turn about with an X.. and... umm.... sometimes the "regrowth" is better that the initial growth.  end transmission

      first off, stupid geocities is discontinuing their ftp, so I have to find another site to put this thing on... no worries, I will remedy this situation, and I will create a link to the new page when it exists so you don't have problems finding it, or remembering the new address. now on to the next...  what is it about girls that drives us so mad?  is it their unique thought processes, the way they look(yes their figure, but no I'm not suckered into the American stereotype of what one should look like), the way they walk, their smell, or is it that God saw it wasn't fit for man to be alone and so created woman to partner with us, keep us company, love... perhaps it's because of God giving us the wonderful gift of women that all of those little things about them attract our attention and make us want them so. so here we are, let's call ourselves men, longing after some girl to come along side us and share her life with us, that we can love and share our life with... (perhaps someone specific, perhaps the idea or just someone...) but it seems like every turn, every curve in the road, we get frustrated and confused because they are different, they don't think the same way as us, the react strangely to things, and we just don't understand.  but we go on, hoping that the next time it will be different, that this time she'll "come around" and everything will work out for once... then we're left wondering if it'll ever "work out," if their truly is someone for us, or if we're doomed to an existence of solitude, with no one their to share life with, no one to love and to cherish 'til death do we part.(and hopefully not even then)  do they realize what their doing when they do it? do they even realize it anytime afterward?  God help me, God help us all.  nuts in a vice... "shaking head no" (sigh)

      i wish i were over her already.  i want to be.  i have this "talent" of being really depressed and drawing it out.  i hate this.  i wish that it would just be over.. not nessisarly seeing someone else, or even looking for someone else... but just to have a mutual friendship.  i guess thats what i miss most of all, that we aren't friends.  my friend says she thinks that i hate her.  i don't.  i want to be her friend.  if i hated her, why would i still want to be with her!!! can anyone answer me this?! arg.  why did i ever fall so deep for a girl?  i let my guard down only to have my heart ripped out.  and guess who i am talking to now?  i hope this conversation doesn't turn deep.  my body can't take it.. i can't take it.  why are boys this prone to getting the nuts in a vise?  well, i guess only the male species can.  wow, what a thought.  food for thought: NEVER DATE!  it hurts, and i am much to young to know this pain.  happy news, i am going to turn-about.  yeha!

      normalcy is going to kill me one of these days... it's nice when you have a friend you can share things with, and they can share things with you, you're able to converse, joke around, even flirt a little... it becomes hard when one side develops feelings for the other, it becomes harder when the other finds out and doesn't know how to react. it's nice when the other side starts coming around again, and you can start having conversations again (no matter how small, or seemingly meaningless) I still don't regret any part of it.  you know, jon hartsaw writes some good music. I'm listening to his most current addition to  urlLink mp3.com.  it's really good. speaking of good music. I went to the Volta do Mar show tonight and their quite amazing as well. all this reminds me how much I want to take time to work on my own music. I know I have some good stuff, and that I could put something together worth buying, worth playing out, I just need to take the time to do it. Casey wrote me an e-mail the other day (I still need to respond to that, speaking of responding... later) telling me about some oportunities up in the Madison area, asked me how things were coming along down here, wondered if our project was still on, or if it should be shelfed for a while. he has spring break soon, said he could maybe come down... that would be good, I think he should really do that. it would be nice to play with him again. maybe there's a show that week that we could go to as well... hmmm.... have to look into that some more. man... no... God, I need to play, I need to write, I need to get out and share it with the world, I need to share You with the world, the gifts You've given me, and the experiences I've had... I know it's all for a reason... or at least You can use it that way(does everything have a reason for happening, I don't really think so, but I know this has, I have, purpose; God reveal!)   ahhh, the cool determination of steel.

      okay, so it 3:30am, and I have to be at work in four hours... that's right at work no later than 7:30am. no church for Seth yet again, and this time it's not because I'm sleeping! John and I have to be done by 11 anyway, so at least I can go meet everyone afterward. it's funny, the way God works. I took Tom Anderson home tonight. It was really cool. we talked about a couple different things, and when we got to his house, we prayed before he went inside. he's actually quite a caring person, he just has a lot of "baggage" at this point in his life. I'm going to make a point to be more courgal to him from now on.   Souled Out was really good tonight. when I first got there the power was out. it came back on about the end of worship, which gave the opportunity to use a mic for the message. Mrs. B spoke to the people who frequent Souled Out. how people seem to have lost the sense of loving others as yourself, which Jesus says is no less important than loving the Lord your God with all your heart sould mind and strength. it was really good.   I'm kind of stupid and... well just plain stupid sometimes. I'm happy for him... I hope that it all turns out well, whether they end up back together or go on as plain ol' regular friends. God bless the both of them.  Guess who was on at 3 in the morning? yep, exactly. things seem to be going well... I suppose we'll know for sure when next our paths cross.(in actual person that is)  I get to play acoustic for church tommorrow night! yeah, I'm looking forward to it, I haven't played for church since I moved down here this past fall. it'll be nice. Ted's playin' drums, Ray on the keys, Matt leading... saaa..weet!  oh man, speaking of excited about cool things... I got a compressor today. ok, so maybe you don't know what that is, but I do, and I like it. good night all...

      Hey ya'll. This being my first venture into the world of the blogging, I will keep it characteristically short and sweet. First of all I gotta give a shout out to all my homies, you know who you are. Secondly to any of my brothers out there who are experiencing the woes of women still, remember always that this is a mere moment in time, the future speeds steadily towards us, and with it the future brings more women, more chances for heartache, and finally that ever elusive opportunity to find " The One". Good luck to you gentlemen. I'll be posting more often now that Seth hooked me up. A moment in time.........

      so people don't really contribute here all that much... I'm not sure what to do about that, maybe I should write here more... that would probably be a good start. well, all in all things have been going pretty well... AC2002 was good, I went home for Easter, which was nice to spend some time with my family, although I was in an accident, it was the other person's fault, and no one was hurt, so that's good, Habitat is tommorrow, I'm starting to spend more time with God, praying/reading, I really want to become more passionate about God again... (almost down to two years)... yeah... my finances need help. what's new right? I really have to get things in order there. God help me! I'm tired. I've been getting to work closer to on time... I'm actually busy most of the day with shipping and receiving, it's kind of nice cuz it makes the day go by quicker. now, I'm all for savoring time, living in the moment, etc etc... but suffering through boredom because there's nothing to do, and you can't exactly just read, sleep, or go somewhere is not enjoyable by any stretch. I have reading to do, and I'm quit tired... I really need to link to here from the old page...

      monday... monday monday.  it's too dang hot.  tax day is a pretty miserable day, ya know?  today was a good day besides the heat.  i came to the realization that my future is uncertain.  my occupation is still very much up in arms, there are so many things that i want to be.  there is so much i want to do, there is on i want to be with.  all seem like they won't happen.  i know i have to give it up all to God, but patience isn't my strong point.  alls i know is that i want to get out of the High School Trap.  it sucks worse that this weather.  oh well.  there ain't much i can do, and i really think i am falling for another young woman.  food for though: you know when you are in trouble when you stick to your shirt.  end transmission

      perhaps I'll do what I can to keep this thing alive myself... if that doesn't work then I'll re-hash things later...  today was good... yep. I got up around 12:30pm, had some cereal, got on the internet. that's what I did for about the next two hours. then jeremiah called, he came over to check his e-mail while I showered, and then we were off... to the library to get tax forms. heh, just getting my tax forms on April 14... am I a procrastinator or what?  drove around, got some food, played my two new songs(rather poorly) for j... drove around, walked around downtown arlington heights, got some jolt at 7-11(the best convenience store around) and went to the concert over at heart 'n soul. it was good. sea and ocean were much better than I remember them being, jon hartsaw was spectacular, the blamed rocked, and denison marrs was way cool. what else could you possibly jam into an already jam-packed day of amusement... denny's of course. i laughed so hard tonight it hurt for an hour afterwards. the good kind of hurt though... the one that reminds you how much fun you had, not that makes you wish you hadn't... enough rambling about that... I'm not even going to try to relate what happened... it was just too funny. now I'm home, doing my usual round of web sites and wondering why it is that I seem to get through it faster and faster each time... I either need to find more sites to visit on a regular basis, or get a life... I think the first is more likely.

      ok.. so I can't seem to get to the blog page right now... but I feel like writing anyway... it'll go up some time. I don't know if I'll finish my story of last weekend. bits and pieces will probably trickle out in other entries for a while and most anyone who knows about this has probably heard about it in at least one form or another..  I was supposed to go to a wedding today. I ended up going to work instead. my boss was being dum the other day so I just figured I'd avoid the hassle and deal. I called my mom and she said she would relate how sorry I was for not being able to make it yadda yadda... I've missed other weddings within my extended family, but this one I really wanted to go to... oh well. at least I can go to souled out tonight... and hopefully since I didn't take off today, it won't be a problem to have off may 7. I really really reaaaaally need that day off. got a gig. not just any gig either... a good payin' gig. plus I don't want to leave casey hanging. that really sux dude!  I started working on recording some stuff last night. greg from work is lending me a  juice  mic and a mic pre... very nice. just recording straight to cd... I can eq and compress blah blah later... the mic is sweet... my performance wasn't the best... grr.. I brought home the cdr from work again.. so I can work on it some before souled out and tommorrow... yeah it's quite fun.  gotta get a  trade 'n times . see how much I can find amps for in there.. vic said he got his fender twin for about $600, and that the average going price is like $500... I'd go for a used twin over a new deville... yeah the deville would be nice have a warranty blah blah.. but it's retailin' at like $740... a better amp for less=seth buys the better amp and has money to spare for something else... yeah I like that idea. we'll see though, yes we shall.  why so much confusion huh? why? I'm growing to hate it...  love is not self-seeking..  I'm trying to learn that... in once instance I think I have it, or at least I'm close... another...  I'm not sure. I think I read into things too much... that I'm always trying to figure out what she's thinking, why she said this, why she did that... it's all quite too much for me.   God help me! please Lord I'm drowning here...   are you holding out your hand to me? am I supposed to have learned already and your waiting for me to realize it? I'm calling out to you..   HELP!!!   ok... I'm gonna jet... take a shower, work on some music.. later yo.

      ... where to start ... if told in full, this could take quite some time.. I guess I'll just start, and if need be I'll continue it later... I won't say finish it tommorrow, cuz tommorrow is likely to add to it... anyways...  so I called in sick to work friday... (this caused some difficulties with co-workers on monday but it was worth it..) took some time to finally fix my guitar, (I replaced the switch, but had it wired wrong, fixed that) chatted some with a friend on-line, showered, packed my van, left my house about 2:30pm. had to get gas and snacks, then took off for lockport, home of my friend brooke... I got there about 3:30 quarter to 4.. I think.. anyway, at which time I proceeded to wait for brooke to finish getting ready for her show, and talk on the phone. weird. when she was on the phone, she looked up at one point and the way she did it, the way she looked, reminded me a lot of my mom. weird. once we got her car loaded, we went and got ice cream (or ous cream, which is what brooke called it... I complimented her on the full house reference) chocolate vanilla twist cone.. mmmmm.. we got to where her show was about 5:30. I did more waiting there. she was all walking around and stuff(much the same as the rest of the night) so I was left to entertain myself. I played her guitar for a little while... the obnoxious noise of bands "setting up" their equipment soon became too much for me to overcome, so I stopped. at one point I lay on the floor staring up at the ceiling for a few peace filled minutes... I decided against staying there long however.. found my way to my bag, where I produced a copy of the little prince, (well a printed from the internet copy) good book (thanks jess for all the references that caused me to want to read it myself) read that for a while... brooke un-happy, I asked her how she was doing... she didn't want to play... didn't feel her music fit in with the other bands... I understood what she meant, but nothing I could say was going to make that situation any better... (i seem to find myself in that predicament a lot.. wishing I could do something, knowing there's nothing I can) she didn't want to read my book, her loss, I bet she'd enjoy it.. later I told her I kind of felt like making a fool of myself... she told me if I did she wouldn't stand by me.. I didn't... I think I got jipped on the amount of time she actually stood by me though... grr..  daniela showed up at some point... can't remember if before the first band or during... whatever.. that made brooke happier, and gave me someone else to talk to(seeing as brooke was quite the wanderer most of the night) I ended up running sound for her when she played; so that was cool. as I was sitting on the floor near daniela during the last band, I learned what it is to rock. oh man, it's 4am.. I gotta work tommorrow, this sucks.. I'm gonna end here. explanation of what it is to rock will come next entry... rockin'

      does it make me a real nerdface that I am on my third consecutive post to the same blog? whatever.. so I've been having some small enjoyment in leaving odd remarks in people's guestbooks. sometimes it has to do with something on their site, sometimes it prolly makes no sense what-so-ever. I commented the other day how it would just be nice to have a place to do laundry. well... I can't use the washer where I live anymore, no it's not just me because I did something dum and am being punished.. if the washer is used the floor drain floods the basement. (in case you don't realize, that's a bad thing) hey... maybe you should sign my guestbook k? you know, all 3 of you that even now about this site. I'm out.

      so what does all this mean? the family I live with got notice that they have to move out in a month. she's going to talk to the guy, say she can't do anything 'til the second week in june. work's really busy right now and there's no way she can get time off to move. plus I'm thinking that it would suck to move when there's only a week or two left of school.(she has two kids in school) I'm not sure where that leaves me. I know she said before, like when I first moved in, that there was the possibility they'd have to move, and that wherever they went there would prolly be room for me, but having only a month, reality tells me I'm not a priority in her search for living accomodations. she hasn't said anything to that affect, but it's what I'm thinking. so do I try to find a place of my own? I can't afford living by myself. say's who? say's $9/hr and 4 years of school bills on three credit cards and a loan from great lakes. ughh! I don't know, I don't know!  I DON'T KNOW!!!  ... i don't know.

      i don't know where I'm going with this..  friends.. hmmm... yeah.  saturday, after the message(s) at souled out, there was an altar call etc.. I was up front for a little while, talked a little with mark, prayed, and then a little after that I went over to where the pool tables used to be, and is now a ping pong table. so I'm standing over there against the wall when tim comes up to me..(he didn't know who I was... he just knew he had to come up to me and say something in order to be faithful to God) he says something to the affect of; even if everyone else leaves you, God is still there and will never leave you. it's a cool statement, and even cooler that someone would go up to someone they don't know to relay it. and it's true, I know it is, but it's got me wondering if it's a warning. like that I need to remember that statement, that fact, because everyone  is  going to leave me(or at least it will seem like it) ok God, it's all well and good that you wanna say how you'll never leave me, and it's fine to put in even if everyone else does... but if you take away all my friends to prove a point, or cause me to grow, it's going to suck. yeah it'll be worth it in the end cuz I'll have learned something, matured or whatever. but why doI have to go through all this suck time huh? the easy road is not the one you intended for us; love is not self-seeking; ... so the next year and a half huh? gonna be quite the growing time isn't it? in some ways I look forward to it... in others... well I only have one word: !@#%! ...yeah.

       3 blogs, 2 guestbooks, 5 posts. what a productive morning I've had. yeah right.   problems come and go. feelings run deep like the ocean, but is the ocean ever the same when you look at it a second time? emotions have played themselves dry and weary from overuse, and my mind is collapsed from the strain I place upon it in my thinking. and then, maybe the ocean is still the same, just in it's vast expanse you are able to see a new area of it everytime.  so I'm pretty much.. ?? well that's a good question really. mostly, in a day to day sense, life is good. when I start to try and see down the road however, even today becomes foggy.  I gotta stop being... pessimistic? maybe just thinking over things so much.. I don't know... "don't take the easy route its not the one god planned for you" thanks daniela that's a good statement. one I need to work on for sure. work in 45min, the shower is callin' my name...

      ok I found this link on another page and just had to find out...  urlLink Hobbit Personality Test  so here's how I turned out...  You are most like  Frodo Baggins, Son of Drogo  With many acquaitenances, Frodo is deeply attached to a few people, like Bilbo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Sam. His high ethics come out in his treatment of Gollum and Saruman. Frodo has pity on Gollum and believes that change can occur. You have a strong personal morality. You are committed to relationships and their growth. You tend to be an idealist, believing the best of the world around you. Time alone is important and solitary activities refresh you. You have a tendency to introspection. While providing compassion and being considerate, you may have the tendency of being soft-hearted or even "too emotional" You like keeping your options open. Closure is probably not one of your strong suits.   The Orcs display the evil side of this personality with their lengthy torture methods.  Traits: Empathic, benevolent, looking to the future. On the dark side you could be sadistic.   so... at least some of that is true... I wonder what other people think?

      ok, for clarification on the "no thanks required" post left on jess' messageboard...  I may swallow my foot, but here goes... to say that I never had thought of jess would be a lie. to say it went beyond passing thoughts caused by frustration due to my liking of someone else and failing to seem to get anywhere with her would also be untrue. so no, I don't have "feelings" for jess. I'm not looking for a "relationship" with her. not interested ok?   if my saying that isn't enough for you... let me give you some further evidence that what I say is true. for some may still be wondering, "why would he leave something like that, referencing  the little prince  no less, on jess' site if it wasn't about her?" or.. "he sure seemed to be around her a lot for someone who isn't interested in her" or... whatever..   1. i am interested in someone else. simple, yet to the point, I'll stop here on this one..  2. for some reason, when I was down at ISU visiting her last weekend, there was a noticable shift in my perspective of her. not that I was "interested" in her, she was cool, she was my friend, that's it. but as I was sitting there talking to her, she became my sister. I won't go into great detail here, but I actually thought to myself, "it's like I'm her brother." unlike some people, this was an entirely new thing for me. I've never felt that way about anyone before. don't get me wrong, there have been people that I have cared deeply about, but I have never had that actual thought before "it's like I'm her brother" it was a very cool moment for me.  so.. I do care for her.. that much is true. do I "like" her? no. I hope this is clear, I hope that I haven't shot myself in the foot with something I said here... this is seth leonard.. good day.

      Another prayer offered in earnest honesty. Do you hear when your back is forever turned? Survival is all I seek, not glory, not riches, to merely find an answer has become a task. The essence of love; the ardor of pain, the stench of decay and I'm left alone to find the answer to every question in my own mind. Is it worth the effort it takes to stand? Is it worth the pain that floods in with each foreign gasp for air? Another prayer goes unanswered and I rot. The escape screams to me frm the shelf, from the closet, from the drawer, from the depths and recesses of my very soul. Bound to endure, destined to drown, I scream to quiet its noise, I laugh to loosen its grip, I cry to realize I'll never have the strength. The escape gains strength every day, and every day I lose. Question, answer delayed, new queston, answer delayed, question fades, answer delayed. I wait for the day my voice gives out and I give in. Waiting for those who couldn't care to care less. Did it make you feel powerful to close the door on me? The soundtrack to my life should be the deafening thud of every door that's ever slammed in my face, and the title should be "Every Back Turned." Let me down. It didn't stop you before, why should it stop you now? You've only known these people for four months, you claim to love me. You'll never see these people again, you claim ti want to be with me forever. They will have long forgotten you by the end of the summer, you're etched in my heart like a scar. Yet, somehow I know it's me you'll choose to let down. I never tried to stop you. Was it a powerful moment? Did you feel release? Will your joy eternally be at my expense? For once in my life I'd like to be the one to slam the door and turn my back in indifference and smile through someone else's pain, and laugh and enjoy life. Somewhere, thousands of miles away, the faint sound of another door slamming in my face. Echo, reverberate, enjoy. It's your dream.

      well tonight we broke down from habitat in record time.. I hope that I remembered everything... not much I can do now. anyway, the reason: spiderman. I wasn't sure how it would be; even after hearing nothing but good things about it. I must say however that it was quite good. I won't ruin it for anyone who is still yet to see it, but I was a bit dissappointed in the ending. :( ah well, tis but a movie.   I'm looking forward to summer being here. not only for warmth, but because it will enable more friends to be able to hang out more often. case in point.. jess is coming home this weekend. (sure, she's only here for two weeks, but you gotta take advantage of what time you get) hopefully both Mike and Jake will be able to stay out  intead of having to go home to do homework now as well. there are others as well that I hope to spend more time with, but I think I'll stop here. (at least for now)   I got my van back. actually I got it back tuesday night, but I haven't written since before that so... well now you know. (and knowing is half the battle ;)  It's nice to be driving my Alice again. (my friend that agreed the name of my van should be Alice, wanted me to spell it Alyss, and I went with it for a time, but I think I just like Alice. if you read this, tell me what you think in my  urlLink guestbook  Alyss or Alice) she still needs some work done on her, and a good bath and vaccuuming are in order, but.. well, you understand, right?   I still have a lot to learn..

      soo... my van broke today. yeah suck! I was driving from souled out to meet alex at the shop (I was supposed to load out a show with him in schaumburg. thanks matt for helping him out.) I went to turn... *wobble* *wobble* no turn-y. hello busted tie rod.. hello I can't afford this. (God provides though right? yes, yes he does) worrisome is how I would describe my mood. after my van got towed, as mike was driving me home he decided it would be best to pray... agreeing with him, he began to pray. as he was praying, not that I was distracted, or not paying attention, but it struck me I could prolly write a killer country tune about my evening. yeah.. maybe I will just for fun.. hmm... maybe not. anyway, it made me laugh to myself. first time I felt better since I became parked in the middle of rand road.   I finished a roll of film today. my last picture was of the gas pump I filled up at today. the pump handle said " Thirsty? " it just struck me as funny. I gotta get this roll developed this week. I know I have some interesting pics on there, and I can't wait to see how they turned out. well I suppose I have to, but... ahhhh!! ok so, I don't really wanna talk anymore. lata

      I am nothing more than a lame man denying his crutch. I wait for the hand of eternal healing and pray that in my own selfish idiocy I don't disregard the answer as just another obstacle to overcome. There is such a thin line we tread between asking God for the desires of our heart and not making the desires of our heart the selfish lusts of our flesh. Sometimes the line blurs, often it seems to not exist at all, this all due to the fact that we are a self focused group of neurons. Can I question something that feels as if it is God's will? Who am I to do so. This web of questions entangles me. Selflessness; something I thought I had, I thought I posessed, I thought I was showing. Am I wearing my selflessness as an ornament to feel as though it somehow makes me deserve you? Do you see my selflessness? Now there is a backwards statement/ question if ever one existed. I want you to know that I love you and that this seperation hurts, but is that merely because I want you to see that I fight for you? I said I don't deserve you yet all I say and do is to make myself feel otherwise. God, I rest in your infinite wisdom. Help me take my eyes off myself and learn true selflessness.

      wow.. so I've done absolutely nothing today. I feel like writing something, but I'm really not sure what I have to say.. so this could be interesting. ( or really dull..)   I've started to wonder if staying up all day was a good idea or not. I think I may get some coffee on the way to church tonight. church... part of me would rather not go this evening. I'm sure I'll still be there anyway. setup for habitat after service. gotta be there for that.  definitely need coffee. after we get stuff ready for habitat (go through sound check and all that) I'm sure we're goin' ta denny's. can't not go, the reprecussions would be horrible. ok, so maybe that's a bit severe but..   so I've effectively avoided thinking of much of anything the past 24 hours or so. I'm not sure if it's because I had John's project to concentrate on or... well, maybe that conversation I had with  urlLink jess  really helped. (thanks a lot jess.. it means a lot to me :)   I think the latter is the case. along with God working in me of course. He's been tryin' to do that a lot lately. I hope He's successful. man o' man, do I. I still feel the same about her. I still ...    "it's an attitude"   yeah.

I think we got some good stuff though. ted's sleeping down stairs right now.    someone, someday, you

        something worth keeping    ok, so I'm not sure I still agree with my last entry, but I'll leave it stand, at least for now, 'cuz that's what I was thinking/feeling then... I had a great time just chillin' with  urlLink jess  tonight. we went to this restaurant where this old guy was rude to us, and then we went to 7-11, and then we hung out at chuck's house, and then we went and got apple juice for ryan(and other hilarious b-day things) and then hung at chuck's some more... ok, so it was more fun than I'm making it sound.. but it's almost 3:30am, give me a break huh? I got other stuff to get to here. anywho.. (I realize that I run certain risks with what I am about to type, but at this point I'm prepared for whatever consequences may come of it.) we started talking of.. personal interests, ya know, personal "relationship" interests. ya see, she knows who I like, and asked me how things are goin'. I mentioned some of what I wrote in my last entry and some things leading up to it  et cetera...  she said it made her sad to see her friends giving up. I explained a little more on what I personally meant, and the surrounding situation.. " if how she acts changes the way you feel about her, your heart toward her, then it probably is something you should give up 'cuz it's not about her anymore. if not, it's worth holding on to. " (ok I admit, it's a paraphrase, but putting it in quotes causes it to make a greater impact) " it's an attitude " (that  is  a direct quote) love that is.. it's not something affected by what she does/says; how she reacts... I think I've realized that any confusion or frustration comes from my own slefishness desiring some "positive" response to what I do/say. but I still feel the same way about her as I did before. that doesn't change. " it's an attitude " so what does that mean?.. where does it leave me?.. what do I do? pretty much the same thing I've been doing(more or less) mabye just a little better. ;)   Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.   amen!

       this is me giving in.. in the middle of a knock down drag out fight with life. yeah, life is hard. on the other had I scored a sweet chicago bears hoodie from john tonight. so what if it's too small. it has a great hood. I have bigger hoodies with smaller hoods. WHAAT IS THAT?!?! so back to the insanity that I call my life... I'm trying hard to just give up, not think about it(her). I really don't want to go through something like this again. it's too hard, and it hurts way too much. I know that nothing good comes easy, that the easy road is not the one God intended for us.(at least me)   but gee whiz Wally.. why does it all seem to be "difficult tasks"? learn learn learn grow grow grow broken humbled learn grow learn grow streeeeeetch ouch! lots of lessons and little benefits/reward.. yes yes store up your treasure in heaven where rust and moth cannot destroy, i know, but come on, life isn't meant to be a continuous series of difficult tasks and learning experiences. at least some of it should be enjoyable. I ought to be able to come through times with something... (someone?) it's all too hard for me. yes, too hard for me. God I need you. I'm far too weak for this Lord. far too weak. far too weak...  I don't know how you plan to do anything with me. or even what for that matter. school? are you really suggesting school again? what about all the bills I already have? you gonna take care of them? alright, so if you want me in school, you'll make a way for it to happen, but am I sure where/what? CLC? I'm so tired of that place. I know that sounds horable, but I just don't know if I can get on the inside, or is that not even what I need to do? you talking associates? not bothering with the ba, and the full-time(and all the bs)? harper? oakton? columbia? how involved am I supposed to be in habitat? what is my calling exactly? I don't know, never really have, just trusted you to have me where you want me... sound classes at columbia.. I don't know about that. something that greg suggested.. could be really good, doesn't seem right at present time though. I like the idea of at least taking photography with ted at harper. I think it would be a lot of fun. fricken money sux! I hate it. I need a guitar amp. a computer would be really nice to have. God.. I give up. you gotta do it. I don't care what or how, but please let it be now. PLEASE! I'll just try to be friends. I suppose that's best for now. reveal to me Lord. smack me in the face with it, 'cuz I'm tired and dum. I love you.. Seth

      :) thanks ted. ya know, it sucks when you forget your password to something. it sucks more when you have no way to change it and the feature on the site that is supposed to e-mail you with your password won't e-mail you. yes this is the situation I find myself in with my guestbook. no no.. that doesn't mean don't sign.. sign all the more.. I will get it fixed.. I will win.  work went by pretty quick today. found out my schedule for the weekend. normal work day tommorrow. well.. I have to be there at 9am instead of 10, but I get done at 4:30.(normal time) I should prolly take a nap after work.. but I will be at souled out. that's a plus.  :)  then back to sleepy-land until... about 2-2:30 so I can be at work about 3am. won't be done then until sometime sunday afternoon.  then I sleep. until when I don't know. I'm glad that I have some time to myself.. and I won't be literally working the whole weekend.  I'm done.. goodnight

      The exclamation point at the end of each entry on this site makes me feel good. It feels as if the page is screaming, " Wow, did you see what he wrote?" Now that's some good sheesh. That's all I have for now.

      today was full of God. I had some great conversation with Justin and Shawn. them telling me what's been going on with them.. me sharing a little of what's been going on with me.. it was really good. the three of us prayed at youth tonight during the altar time. it was key. juice even you might say.. well.. shawn had some interesting things to say as he prayed.. God has some breaking to do in me I guess.. I new He was working in me.. that I have things to learn and grow in.. I had kind of overlooked the whole breaking thing up to this point.. anything worth having is going to cost something.. God's gonna fully heal some stuff I prolly thought was already taken care of.. it's gonna hurt at first.. but it will make me stronger and healthier in the end.  I can't worry.. worrying does me no good.. will it add a day to my life or an inch to my height? no, of course not. don't worry seth, don't worry. I gotta start living God's call for my life.. it just seem's so general. no specifics.. ergh.. God you have to do it.. I don't know how. ahhhh.. so much to say.. things I shouldn't write here. that's frustrating. things I want to document, I want to remember, write down for the future, and I can't! God grant me good memory. help me to remember all of this. I doubt that many people actually read this(because I don't think too many people actually know about it) but I guess I'm sort of suprised that anyone would continue to read it.. I'm so vague most of the time that very few would know what I'm talking about at any given moment, and not even them all of the time. whatever. keep reading. sign the guestbook. love God. make your mark. give someone $5. leave 'em wanting more...

      alright.. my brother is on his way with shawn ezro in tow, so I don't know how much time I have to write.. it's been a couple days though so I want to make sure to keep things current. I really need to get some links going on this page.. and my layout is leaving much to be desired I'm afraid.. soon I will be remedying these situations.. dang.. they just got here.. well, short version.. things are looking up. :)

        tug  well first off I want to say what's up to my bro tyler. (while I simultaneously try to remember if I gave him the address or not. I don't remember giving it to him. which makes me curious as to how he got it... not that I don't want him to read it.. just curious.. so how did you hear about my page huh?) thanks for signing the  urlLink guestbook . hopefully others will follow in your footsteps. *hint* *hint*    played some bass at habitat on thursday. it was a lot of fun, and I think worship went fairly well over all. I hope I can get in on that action again. afterward, I went to pick  urlLink jess  up and meet everyone else at Bakers Square. Abdur is the man! don't believe me? check out what  urlLink jess has to say about him.  he is the man! once our hunger was satisfied, and we could stay no longer, mike, matt, jake, jess, and myself went back over to Northwest Assembly. I'm not entirely sure why we went in the first place, but I do know we ended up having dizzy races from one side of the lobby to the other. well, actually I only really tried once, and I got so dizzy spinning I fell over and smacked the back of my head on the floor. *ouch!* (it didn't help that I got hit in the back of the head at work today with a falling 10x14 screen case either...) to be honest, my neck and shoulders have been soar ever since, but it was quite the sight to see I'm sure.  friday.. at the sheridan in arlington heights by 10am. set up the stuff blah blah pretty boring, right? well, as I was heading back up to my van, I GOT STUCK IN THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR!!! how does that happen? I was in there for prolly twenty minutes before two guys from engineering busted the door open. I didn't get to the shop 'til 'bout quarter to 1 in the afternoon. I ended up leaving around 4:45 to go down to the university of chicago. didn't get back in the suberbs until 11:30 or so. here's the kicker though... I had to be back down there at 3:30am to load out. I got two two hour naps this morning. one before load out. and one after load out before I had to be at work (10am) when I got home from work today, I took a wonderfully long/hot shower. it was excellent! souled out was quite good tonight. I have been getting something from every service I've been to there recently. that's not something you can say about everywhere(and of course it's different for different people too) I get to be a part of the intimate fellowship between the Father and the Son. that's really cool. do you realize that Jesus' face was unrecognizable? that's how severely he was beaten... had to pick up the stuff at the sheridan at 11pm tonight. the dude had everything picked up and put away when I got there. all I had to do was haul it to my van and load it in. that's freakin' awesome! I was out by 11:30. met up with jess, ted, joe, and jake at denny's.(ah but not the same one we used to go to(the one at palwaukee) now we go to the one by 53 in Rolling Meadows. it's much better.) that was fun. now here I sit doing my daily routine of checking my e-mail and my friends' online journals. soon and very soon I am going to go to bed.  hug  ;)

       B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L ! ! ! that sums up what today's weather was. I had to drive down to navy pier for work today. I was sweatin' hard core style. yeah, just ridin' in the van! it felt good to sweat. my left arm got some sun. I think my right arm feels a little left out. it'll deal. so I ran home and showered before habitat. man that was awesome. what a great shower. habitat was good tonight. well.. sorry mat but I missed most of what you were talking about. my mom called and I decided I should talk with her. I got back in just in time to make sure I turned johnny's electric on for worship. *phew* that was close. (thanks G)   I'm going to camp. I just don't know if for both weeks or just one. if I go to one.. it will be the second one.. senior high camp. I passed the idea by my boss this afternoon. I don't think he was real keen on the idea, but I think he'd let me. (go God go) prayin' about it still. I really need to contact John Marx. talk to him about it. yeah..  really  need to do that.  I'm gonna hit the hay early tonight. good night everyone, and God bless.

         urlLink    which Episode II character are you?      Yoda. Jedi Master. Your word is pretty much gospel, as far as others are concerned. You stick to your roots and have a good head on your shoulders. You can always provide a good response to those in need of answers, or those who just want to talk. You may not look tough, but inside you've got more power than the majoirty of people.   heh.. "must is, must ain't don't sound right" - my dad

      was nearly quarter to five as I drove by my friends house.. the long way home.. and the blue passed by overhead now entering arlington heights, I pass by chicago .. the long way home.. it hangs in the sky like smoke  actually jess.. I had to go to work.. if home was my destination I would have gladly stayed out much later. and actually as it turns out.. I didn't really need to leave for another hour. I should have known better than to believe my boss when he said it would be over at 1am. ah well.. I get payed for it either way. it was nice to see you one last time, as I did not expect that I would.  things always happen when you least expect them..   so yeah.. I helped load out the aragon tonight (this morning) I suppose my being early helps make up for my lateness this morning(well yesterday now actually)   today is memorial day.. a time when we are to remember those that died to help protect our freedom that we have in this country. I plan on sleeping for some time.. then waking up and going to the beach with some friends. gotta pitch some shoes if you know what I mean. maybe some frisbee will be in order as well. mmm.. I hope that we grill out or something. it wasn't discussed as far as I know, but dang would that be good!    brooke, I'm not sure if you even read this but good luck on the big project you have to work on today. I hope that you get some time to relax and enjoy your day off.  I've been doing a lot of praying and thinking recently about my future. for once I can say that I think I have been doing more praying then thinking. that's a good thing. I guess it really started when justin and shawn came down to visit... and then tim's message on saturday kept me going in the same direction.. well seeking God for direction that is. funny.. as I was loading out the congress this morning.. dan moritz called.. I know I mentioned that before but.. searching God on what to do and * bam * Dan calls and asks if I want to go to camp. I must say that I'm starting to lean towards it. I still have to pray about it, and get the right info from Dan on it.. but it seems right. ya know? the next two years are going to be key. I can just tell.  I've been listening to the gloria record   start here  a lot recently. nothing is actually playing right now.. but that's been in my car cd player almost without exception. i was born in omaha is like my favorite song right now and I can't wait to hear it again.   seeing as it's almost 6am and I would like to get some good rest before traveling off to the beach.. I'll have to be going now.   good night and God bless. :)

      still no password info.. I arrived at souled out around 8:30 last night.. yeah, I know that's a half hour after it's supposed to start. I was playing my guitar, taking a shower, and writing a goodbye message in a card to  urlLink jess . :( for some reason beyond my grasp I love that girl to bits. now I realize some people that actually read this know both  urlLink jess  and myself, and let me assure you that there is no intention of  that  sort.. she's my sis :) (plus intention of  that  sort rests with another) I'll miss her while she's at camp... 'nuff said.  I was to be at the congress theatre at 6am this morning.. well I wasn't. I had both my clocks set for 5:20.. well I woke up at 7:20 and got to the congress about 8. I was not happy with myself for that. I mean, I slept through two hours of alarm clock! that's just plain ridiculous. I fortunately did not get in trouble for it. *phew* so I worked there 'til 9:30 or so and went off the McDonald's for breakfast.(the rock 'n roll mcdonald's to be exact) john flaws himself bought us breakfast this morning. this made me especially happy since I only had $1 in my wallet. got over to excaliber about quarter after 10 or so.. didn't leave until after 7:30pm tonight! most of the time I was standing there.  just in case  I suppose. I hope I never see stuff like I saw tonight ever again. I came to the conclusion that most guys are perverts. whether they like women or men.. perverts!   yuck!   here's something interesting.. while I was helping load out the congress this morning, Dan Moritz called me. he was wondering if I wanted to go to camp this year.. he knew I'd been there the past couple years.. et cetera.. I didn't talk to him about it much since I was working at the time and was already  two hours late  and didn't want to get in trouble. (since it seems as though I avoided it by the skin of my teeth.. thanks for that one God :)  interesting.. maybe this is some direction for my future.. just maybe...  so now I'm just waiting.. waiting for mike to call and tell me what's going on tonight.. waiting to see if I get a response.. waiting to see if I get a response.. waiting for 1am to roll around when I have to be at the aragon to load out another show.. waiting for some revelation on what I'm supposed to do(perhaps I got a clue to this one this morning.. hmm... ).. waiting.. waiting..  waiting.

      my hair is now darkest smouldering auburn.. I think I like it.  the bottle was pretty cool last night. the second band was quite good. they're called  the midstates . ok-go was the headliner. they are a good band.. not necessarily my favorite music, but good. I found out about this pizza place that's open 'til 5am! that's exciting to me. good pizza too!   today at work started off busy and fast paced. it then drifted off into the rest of the day. not a bad day all in all. shortly I'll be taking a shower and leaving for souled out. mike's supposed to give me a call when he, ted, and jake are done with accountability. I wonder if we'll do anything tonight?  not sure what's going on tommorrow. I should probably go to living hope, talk with john marx and everyone else that I haven't seen for quite some time now. gotta talk to john about camp. wanna go.. wanna go. tommorrow night I'm not sure about either. *wondering if brooke wanted me to go swing dancing with her tommorrow specifically or just some sunday* *maybe I'll give her a call tommorrow afternoon...*  in the spirit of the test craze that has been going on lately...

      I think there's something in my room that makes me sick. I felt pretty good going to sleep last night again, and then when i woke up I'm all coughing and soar throat; yuck! eh.. tristan, mary, and edwin were over when I got up. they took off not long after I came upstairs. do you think it was personal?   work at noon today. short day today, woo hoo! I hope things go well at work today. it just make things nice when they do. no idea what's goin' on after work today. I feel like I really haven't talked to the boys all week. monday and tuesday at quencher's, wednesday with daniela and brooke.. I saw them for a short time last night but then had to go work. I wonder if they're doin' anything tonight? I thought will was gonna call me sometime this week.. what did I do with his phone number.. gotta find that.    it feels good to be up well before I need to be at work. I had a bowl of cereal, and I get to take some time on-line. aww.. shizzle.

      I waaaaaay ti-ewrd..    yesterday was fun. I got down to daniela's 'bout 1:30pm.  we went to the mall and walked around. quite literally that's all we did. I think we only actually went into two stores and stopped for me to get coffee. then we went to threshold where I bought my first ever fugazi  cd. (just so you know.. they do not dissappoint) then her mom fed me (even though I wasn't hungry) it was quite good. I felt bad that I couldn't finish it though. (I wasn't hungry)   then church. apparently the first wed of the month = combined worship and split up the junior high and senior high kids for small groups. it was good. I didn't get to say hi to a couple of people because we had to leave right away afterward to go to the ashbary coffee house for open mic.   the open mic there was very different from the one at quencher's. quencher's you sign up for a spot and play 3 or 4 tunes and your done. ashbary you spread yourself out a bit more. play one or two now.. another later.. a couple after that.. it's cool. lot's of poetry read too. this one kid brought bag pipes.. mad props to that kid! Brooke did a really good job. it seemed as though people liked my stuff.. but I'm not entirely sure if they were just being nice. I think they found it to be somewhat enjoyable at least though.  the ashbary is about a half hour from my house. I went the other way. first to brooke's house to switch over to daniela's car and go to her house. I could have stayed the night there, but I was wide awake, so I figured it would be better for me to just go ahead and drive home.  I'm not sorry for the detour. (thanks daniela :)  your a good friend)   I went to bed feeling good.. but boy did I feel like crap this morning. ugh! I went to work anyway.. and it was fine. about normal I suppose. I got my shure t-shirts today. I was supposed to get them tuesday (I called in sick) john bobeng was good to me. the other guys were rummaging through and he saved me three.   habitat cookout. mmm... good food.  then I had to load out a show. two hours, prolly make $50 for it. not bad. now I'm dead tired though. goodnight.

      okay.. not much time.. I still have to shower yet and I want to be down at daniela's by 1:00pm at the latest. quick rap up of yesterday:  1\ woke up on time to get ready for work. 2\ called in sick to work /me feel crappy :(  3\ get on-line/chat with daniela/chat with brooke/other on-line stuff 4\ decide I'm going to meet brooke at the fireside at 6pm(I have to be down the street at quencher's at 9:30 anyway.. so should work out well, right?) 5\ 3:30pm lay down to take a half hour nap. 6\ half hour turns into three and a half hours.  DOH!  7\ get ready and get down to the fireside a little after 8pm (what is it with me and being two hours late?!?!) 8\ there for about a half hour/brooke decides to leave/only reason I went/so left as well 9\ walked over to quencher's 10\ walked to van where read and prayed for 20min or so 11\ back to quencher's to wait for eric 12\ help run sound 13\ end up with extra $10 in pocket for helping eric(didn't think I'd get anything.. well I did get free drinks.. I found out I like soda water with lemon.. I think I'll try lime next time) 14\ went home/quick run through of on-line routine/sleep.. ahh sleep.  so that's my day.. pretty much. gotta run

      welcome back ed. lightning is a gorgeous creation that has the power to entertain, excite, scare, and destroy all in the same instant. I saw some great examples of this wonderful display we call lightning on the way home this evening.. ah yes.. on the way home. I went to quencher's tonight for their open mic night. I went to enjoy and kind of feel the place out for future opportunities. talk about future opportunities! I actually ended up playing a couple rough songs at the very end. my voice was nothing short of dieing on me but it was fun. eric(the guy who kind of heads it up.. a former employee of wcm actually) said that he wanted me to come back next week and play earlier in the night when more people would be around. most certainly. so then I mentioned that I could help out with the sound too if he needed it. *wam* opportunity smacks me upside the head. (praise God. He is so awesome. I love and appreciate Him immensely) looks like I'm on the sub list for running sound there now. (yeah.. woo hoo!) I got his phone number and he introduced me to steve and I gave steve my number so they could get a hold of me. looks like I'll be heading down there tommorrow night(tuesday) to get a grasp on how things work there and where everything is. ( \w/ rock on!) apparently it's some jazzy group tommorrow or something, and it starts 'bout 9:30pm. (sah-weet!) I'm excited. what's funny is I was talking to shawn today (this guy I met through elliot on a windy city show.. he's goin' on tour with converge in a couple weeks to run sound for them. now that's cool.) he was talking about going to some club and talking to the sound guy there and basically getting in like I did tonight at quencher's. sometimes God moves quicker than we expect. I probably wouldn't have said anything to eric about helping out if I hadn't talked with shawn about such thing earlier in the day. man, God's timing is weird/amazing/ perfect . (that really gives me hope for waiting) I'm stoked! got to play some tonight. gonna play some wednesday night at the ashbarry coffee house. get to hang with daniela during the day wed.. go to church (christian hills) see kyle flannigan probably. see brooke. "working" tommorrow night (learning the ropes at least) maybe hanging with will friday night and going to that ihop (international house of prayer ...no not pancakes) extension that's in the area (and if not this friday, then prolly soon at least :)  summer kick off bar 'b que for habitat thursday night. hopefully souled out again this saturday.(I like going there. I always seem to get something from the service) what a great week in store for seth. it makes me quite happy. (and I already talked about going over to chuck's last night after chillin' with dan culp for a while. that was cool too) I need some rest. still fighting off this cold ( or whatever it is.. it sure is annoying!) have a great day and God bless.  ps oh yeah.. almost forgot. looks like from the calender above the bar that there is an open jazz jam (or something like that) on sunday nights. I know some of you like jazz. we shall have to go sometime.  pps I love you.

       alright.. now that's all done with, I can get on with life; or at least talking about life.. or something?  5 hours on-line  this afternoon that's right  5 hours !!!  I took a lot of tests on  urlLink the spark  and chatted with a few friends. (daniela  urlLink brooke  and  urlLink thad )    looks like I'm gonna go visit daniela on wednesday. yeah.. I've decided to make better use of my days off. instead of sleeping all day I'm gonna do stuff.. yeah stuff. this wednesday.. well I said that.. I'm gonna visit daniela; go to church with her. then I'm guessing we hit up the open mic night at the ashbary coffee house where  urlLink brooke  has been playing every wednesday for a while now I guess. maybe I'll try my hand (or my songs rather) as well.. we shall see.   anyways.. after being on-line all that time.. I decided I should do something a little more human... so I took a shower and drove around for a little bit. tried callin' some people. as usual when I'm looking for something to do,   no one answered their phones  yeah well.. mike called me back right away, so that was cool. I ended up going over to northwest to see if dan was there and what he was up to. it was good to see anne. haven't seen her in a while. apparently it was good to see me. she gave me what I suppose I would describe as a  cat call  when I came walking up. strange. it was kind of flattering.. but  strange  ended up across the street over at photo's. mmm.. double dog.. mmm.. you know barq's root beer is quite good out of a fountain. I highly recommend it. ;)     drove dan home afterward.. well, we drove around for a while; the end of which came to be in front of his house. it was good talking with him again. we haven't done enough of that, and I look forward to doing more of it.     for some reason..    I decided to drive out to  urlLink chuck 's at that point. it was cool. I finally met the infamous miah that everyone has talked about (okay.. maybe not everyone.. but I've heard his name quite a bit in the last week or so)  urlLink hartsaw  was over there too.(he's doin' some rad stuff with the  urlLink star of earendil  page) we watched adult swim of course. I mean what else do you do sunday night between 10pm and midnight.  fuu-nny!  I just may have to make a point to be over there sunday nights from now on.. hmm...  fuu-nny!  left there 'bout 2am.. I figured, " if I gotta go move my van anyway.. I'm just gonna go ahead on home for the night ." so I did, and here I sit at my computer for another logged hour of on-line time. (no I don't actually log my on-line time. that would be kinda funny though, huh?)    I'm thinking of checking out that open mic thing at quenchers tommorrow night that elliot told me about. I'm not for sure decided, but I want to go sometime, and there's not practice for habitat so it would be a good opportunity... we shall see. goodnight.

      denny's is a horrible thing to waste... wednesday night ted and I realised that we hadn't been to denny's in about 3 1/2 weeks! I know.. it's horrible. we remedied that right off. been to denny's two nights in a row now and it feels good. now I'm not saying we need to go back to 4 or more times a week, but to go off denny's all together is just plain wrong. can I get an amen?  the bosses were gone from work today  :)  habitat went well tonight. I should probably start paying closer attention to the word that is shared.. I don't think I can remember what has been talked about ever. given.. I have a hard time remembering anyway.. but yeah.. I should pay attention.   still need to finalize camp stuff. (come one seth, let's get this done!)  I'm excited! bar 'b que 'n at jake's house tommorrow night. gonna be a good time. yeah.  jeremiah called me tonight. he's a cool kid man. cool kid. sounds like he's comin' along well with the music, and God is gettin' him by financially. look forward to seeing him again.  speaking of people I miss.. I really need to write jess a letter at camp. she's been gone for like three weeks now! I can't believe it.   moving soon. not sure when. not sure where. maybe sunday afternoon. maybe in another week. maybe... I don't know. God please make something work out. thank you.  ugh! more to do.. I still haven't even started packing. I gotta get wedding cards and send 'em to where they need to go. father's day is sunday...   stuff.. yeah stuff.

       yeah I'm ready to be a rock star. wearing the same clothes in different configurations for days on end; never sure when the next time you'll step into a shower will be.  I've already successfully lived out of my van for a month. (did that when I first moved down here in the fall. crashed on johnny's floor for most of that time) I practice the other two on a regular basis. as of today, I haven't showered for three days now. (oh come on.. it's not that bad. I know other people that do it too. besides, I'm practicing to be a rock star. it's a must) the clothes thing.. well they're mostly clean...   okay.. so I've really only played three times at two different open mics.. and I should finish some more stuff, and maybe get a cover or two ready for filler (in case I gotta play for a long time for some reason.. plus they're just fun sometimes) it's funny. when I saw ryan a couple months ago.. I told him I lived in a family's basement, and that I worked for a sound & lighting company... he asked me if I was in a band. first thing/straight up. it made me chuckle. I asked john if he still wanted me to play bass for him at shows. he said yeah, unless he got charlie to play. wants me to run sound for him wherever he plays. I appreciate his compliment on my sound running skillz(as they are mad to be true); and in some ways I would be a part of the band 'cuz I would "tour" ( I use this term very loosely) with them wherever they went; but it's not quite the same as playing on stage. I don't know if anything will really come of it or not. he wants to play.. whatever.. he prolly won't get charlie any way. I wonder how it will work.. ted being in two bands and all?   I gave avis a ring last night. I was scrolling through my phone book entries and was like, " I wonder what avis is doing.. I haven't talked to her in I don't know when.." she was going out to a movie with someone last night.. but said she'd give me a call today and we'd do something. I think she mentioned that a bunch of people are doing stuff today and that we could get together in a big group and go mini-golfing or something.  it should be fun.   stupid gotta run to accu-trak.. ergh.. stupid stupid stupid.. it's not like I get anything for doing it. not even payed for my time probably. oh well.   .. and we'll have fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the t-bird away...

      so I never got around to the computer lab in the hotel and now I'm at temporary sleeping place number two. someone's house that crystal works with. it seems pretty nice. they have a high speed connection of some sort, so that's a plus. I'm on a mac.. which is cool.. but it's set up to work like a pc and the trackball eats it... I guess I'll just have to live with it. (yeah right)  so I started helping out with sound at heart 'n soul on friday night at the hardcore/metal show. it was a blast. I helped at souled out last night too, so yeah... I may be running sound at the show next sunday night.. brandston/denison marrs/twothirtyeight/element 101/anathello and some other band that I can't remember their name right now. I'm looking forward to that.  I wanted to go swing dancing tonight.. ya know.. for my second time ever.. but I have negative dollars. that's right, I think if I had any less money I would qualify to be my own government. oh well. I will go again. just not tonight.   found out that ted is gonna be home this week. no cornerstone after all. that sucks! rather selfishly, that gives me someone to hang out with this week. hopefully I'll be able to hang out with daniella sometime this week. she's rad.   sometimes I wonder if I annoy some of my friends. I hope not 'cuz I love 'em a lot.   I miss jess. I hope we are able to talk sometime soon. it seems like we always catch one another at bad times. :( one of these times it'll work. :)    I was all nervous and stuff on friday night. no, not cuz of the show.. I had to talk with someone.  I finally did and it was rather anti-climactic. neither of us knew what to say, and I can't say for sure if anything even came out of it. sometimes I just feel kinda helpless when it comes to you. ( i don't know if you even read this.. and you won't be around for a week now anyway) God bless you and keep you safe  so now I'm waiting for ted to call me. he was supposed to call erica and helen to see if they wanted to do something and call me right back. yeah.  I'd like to send a big thank you and much love to heather and mike who have both on seperate occasions in the past week demonstrated their love and concern for me in ways that I appreciate beyond the scope of language.

      thanks for the posts there jeremiah.. I am quite looking forward to hearing this masterpiece you've been working on. I'm nearly peeing myself with anticipation.(or maybe I just have to go really bad) so you like the changing color thing, huh? I'm not sure how I feel about it. It works for now at least.  I don't really have time for any detailed blogging right now.. but I am going to camp next week. I leave tuesday and get back sometime saturday. (that's the plan anyway) I have to work at quencher's tonight, and I'm hoping that it goes well(and hopefully not too late. I want to get up and go to living hope in the morning.. I should go to early service too, so I can get over to northwest.. as I won't be around this week it would be nice to say goodbye to people) yikes!  gotta go.. more to follow..

       killing myself and dying to know why   I told God that if He wanted me to go to camp then he had to make it easy to change the dates I was taking off. you see.. I had the wrong dates at first, and it know turns out that senior high camp is just next week! amazingly enough, my boss was really okay with it. "that shouldn't be a problem" he said. so I changed the dates I had off in the book and everything is good right? well... I took a look at my bank statement today. I'm in the red a c-note. do you have any idea how much that hurt?!?! so as of right now I have sixty some dollars in my pocket which forty some odd dollars of has to pay for my phone bill before they cancel my service.(which means I gotta get to the mall in the next hour) so I took another show at quencher's. tommorrow. wednesday night. I gotta call dave and tell him I can't run sound. I have to be there at 8:00 it turns out and I gotta make sure habitat is ready. I don't know how it's gonna work but I really need the cash. so I have off for camp, and as far as I know people are expecting me to be there next tuesday. I really want to be there too. the way it came up(me going that is) and how easy it was to switch my dates have to be signs from God. right? so what do I do about my financial situation? whether I end up going or not, I may take another show on saturday instead of going to souled out. that sucks! I really like going to souled out. I really need to make the extra bucks.  what extra stinks about working tommorrow night too is that epd is playing their last ever show and I can't go. well I couldn't go if I wasn't working cuz I'm broke but... ergh!!  I talked to my dad for a few minutes today. it's his birthday. he's now 52. I'd say he looks quite good for his age too. I told him I didn't know if I could really go to camp next week. (what with missing the week of work) he said that he wondered the same thing, and thinks it would be better for me to not go and work. "sometimes you gotta do" I love my dad a lot and appreciate what he has to say. some small part of me thinks God will make it work if I go. but I'm really struggling with it right now.  I found out I had the wrong dates last friday when I was talking with my mom. I was upset, cuz I really wanted to go and I didn't think my boss would let me off for the right dates. she told me that if God wanted me to go he would make it work. he made the days off work.. he could make the money work right? of course he can. but does he really want me to go? I feel like I'm giving up if I just don't go. not like something I just wasn't able to do (like going to epd's show tommorrow) but like I'm giving up short of where I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to be doing. It's all so difficult to discern right now, and my being tired is only compounding the difficulty.  I am so blessed to be staying with the family I'm staying with. I haven't bought food for a couple few weeks now, and crystal hasn't said a word. amber made a crack about it today, I think cuz she was hungry. anyway, God bless them a lot!  what am I supposed to be doing anyway? if it wasn't for God's grace and Crystal's leniancy/giving heart there is no way whatsoever I could be down here right now. "home" again is not where I want to be. for quite some time now I've never really had straight answers for what I want to do, where I want to go, life goals, plans, vision... as of late I've started feeling like I need to get some. before it was okay.. like I didn't need to worry about it.. and I don't feel like I need to be worrying about it (worrying is no good, can I add an inch to my height or a day to my life? no) I'm just starting to feel like I need to do something about it. I've got a crap load of bills and other like things that need to be taken care of.. I've been to school off and on for 6 years now since high school with no degree to show for it. I'm not really sure that I need one.. but I need to do something. feel like I'm getting somewhere. like I have purpose, and I'm fulfilling it. God help me please.  I met this interesting guy last night. his name is dusty. he was talking to me about music and what he wants to do with it and what he thought of my stuff and my playing, and it was pretty cool. I ended up giving him a ride home. I was kind of debating on whether or not I should and I just felt a tugging like I should. I prayed that somehow I could share God's love with him (or something like that at least, I don't remember exactly what I said) I'm not sure if I followed through on it. we ended up getting something to eat at this little diner. funny, when we left I was reminded again that for some reason non-christians seem to be a lot more giving with their money than we as christians are. and he wasn't the only person that has reminded me of that since I've started at quencher's. people are always bummin' each other smokes or buyin' someone a beer, and dusty bought me breakfast. and left prolly a 30% tip on top of it. why can't we be that giving? something to not just ponder, but do something about. I'm thinking I may have opportunities in the future to share with dusty... I just have that feeling.  time to be off to pay my phone bill. I think I'll try to call jess. yeah. big day with joie tommorrow. I'm looking forward to it. God bless.   ...and I feel that far away

       picking it up where I left off...    I picked up jess.. her dad liked my clothing ensemble apparently.. my combination of a cheerleading shirt and a white belt was what did it.. :)  we drove to the mall so jess could exchange some lotion for something she liked the smell of better. I learned the difference between lotion and cream.. (cream has avocado oil in it so it feels a little greasier, but is much more moisturizing) .. then to heart 'n soul. moved stuff.. set up stuff.. sat around.. said hi to the guys from brandston.. then the show. it was excellent. well aside from some feedback issues, and the fact that you couldn't hear the lead singer from element 101 to save you life.. but other than that it was really good. it was cool to be able to mix for 238 and brandston.. I helped out with the others but joie was the lead for denison marrs and embodyment.. good show.   one kind of weird point.. jess says this doesn't make me a dork, that just me as myself am one, but anyway.. I half wondered if she would show, but I really didn't expect it, and when I saw the car and realized whose it was.. fluttery nervousness. I wanted to run and hide. but I didn't. maybe you read this. maybe you don't. maybe I'm just a big dork. you still love me anyway?  my brother and shawn came down with alice and someone else.. I don't remember who.. well.. yeah.. it was good to see 'em.  jess and I took off right after the show.. actually embodyment was still playing (we ran pretty late with the show.. as usual.) I left my guitar in the hands of brooke, and rode like the wind. after a stop at taco bell and a little turning around because taco bell distracted me from my turn it was a non-stop trip to camp manitoqua. we listened to the new anathallo cd and jess fell asleep. well it would have been non-stop, and we would have made it by midnight, but just as I turned down 30(about 5-10 from the camp) up came the lights behind me. after a brief explanation of mount prospect and wisconsin id's and camp curfews(which I think was our saving grace) the police officer was nice enough to let us proceed without a ticket (even though I was cruisin' a hefty 15 over down la grange). praise God my lord and savior. as we drove on and the cop turned around I just started laughing.. so close, we would have made it. that's the second time God has been faithful in the past month or so.. jess was prolly five minutes late for curfew. fortunately the doors weren't locked yet.   after jess showed me where my head would rest that night, she went off to her room. I read for a while and had a most restful sleep. now I'm not sure if I actually woke up before jess came in this morning or not.. I think I did once, but I'm really not sure 'cuz after going back to sleep (if indeed I did wake up) I dreampt(dreamed??) that I woke up (and I know I was dreaming 'cuz when I did wake up the windows in the room were different.. and the room was shaped a little differently as well) now I've never really looked into dream analyzation or anything.. but I know that in america's sweethearts they say that when you dream about bread it represents something you can't have. I realize that's prolly not the best place to get info like that from.. but that's my background and I think perhaps God was telling me something. I don't think I'll go into all of it here. I imagine that fewer than six people will hear the actuals of this dream, and I apologize for the carrot, but those who should now will know, and may even ask me about it. you all know who you are. oh.. and don't be so sure of yourself right away. try to wrap your mind around it after you read this..  it wasn't her .    the word of the day is still wait.

      visiting jess with ted was soo much fun. aside from being generally ridiculous, we were able to just sit and talk some as well. always time well spent with either of these two good friends. found some good buys as unique thursday morning.  incubation and embryology   ha! alas.. jess had to be off to the sox game, so ted and I drove home where we hung out the rest of the day. (well.. in the home area at least)   friday was pretty dull. ted and I went to frontier days with erin and her friend kelly where we proceeded to be bored out of our skulls. oh well, not all girls can be as exciting as jess.  after work saturday I went to breanna sanders wedding. well that's not her last name anymore... whatever. I got there just in time to see them kiss. (better than cable according to justin) I got to see pat and gail and david and renee and the butchers and sanchez's and of course my family. I didn't expect to stay around for the entire reception but I didn't end up leaving 'til 8:00. ted wanted to get some sleep and jess was hanging out with mark, so since I had nothing else to do and no one to pick up I went on down to quencher's. it was a pretty good time. the guitar was nearly deafening, so it was a bit difficult to match the vocal level to it, but I did my best and I think it went okay.    so I slept in this morning at ted's house. had a good time reading the word and praying. it's nice to just sit and do that without much concern for time or anything. now I'm just trying to see what time I need to be at the building today for the show.  and I'm out...

       prolly my last post before camp..   I'm not really sure where this is going so we shall see what transpires. I am now for sure going to camp. I leave tuesday, late morning time.   YAY CAMP!!!  I am soo looking forward to camp this year. I just have a feeling that God wants to do some stuff. It's exciting. plus I don't know how it's all going to work out financially and all, and putting my faith in God about it is somewhat exhilirating. so I went to living hope this morning to talk with jon marx about camp. got forms to fill out and take with me on tuesday.. I'll probably be a counselor, but if for some reason they don't need me to do that I'll most likely end up doing daytime security. I guess that will keep me quite busy during the day... as long as I have time to work on my music and talk with friends I'll be okay. not that those are the reasons I'm going.. I'm just hoping to have time to do them. I'm glad I don't have to do the computer stuff there. I would have done it if I had to, but it's not really my strong point anymore and I imagine it would have been high stress and low free time. God works things out. yeah he does. I love him for that.  I went on a mission for shampoo/conditioner and flip flops after lunch. (which thanks to cal, susan, and charlie was free to me. God bless them for that) I didn't realize that it would be so hard to find flip flops in the summer time. I checked old navy, pay less, wal mart, target, marshalls, tj maxx, and walgreens... walgreens was the most promising, but they didn't have my size. grr.. all I want is a pair of flip flops for camp.. is that so much to ask? I really don't think so. I'll try again.. perhaps tommorrow.. I gotta find more wal-greens to check. I tried two so far.. tommorrow.. tommorrow..  went over to the intern house to meet up with dan. had a cool conversation with cynthia. we've only known each other for a relatively short time, and hadn't really talked before. it was way kewl.  said goodbye to a bunch of people tonight. (cuz I'm goin' to camp yo) looking forward to a good week. keep me in your prayers.. later.

      camp was definitely good. I have some stuff to sort through from camp though.. so I don't know how much I can really write about it right now. it was good, God is working, I'm still learning (and waiting.. everything in God's timing)  lack of funding.. heh.  novemberish.. that should give us plenty of time to work something up. I need to work on music more. I don't spend enough time developing it.    I sat down hoping I'd be able to write some stuff.. but things just aren't flowing today. I gotta go..

      howdy hey i'm sure you'll post how camp went so i won't ask. other than that whats going on? same ol' lack of funding here. i'm thinkin' about selling my car in order to have some cash in my pocket (well not really but the thought did go through my mind).  i'm definately ready to get back to where the action is! hey, lets (sooner or later...novemberish?) put something together for one of those open mic nights eh? yeah that would be cool.  so there you have it an email for your blog...i didn't feel like opening my email up so since i was logged in i thought i'd do this instead.  peace \w/

      a very merry un-birthday to me, to you  way too much money going out. nine dollars at lunch. fifteen dollars at dinner. another ... well i got the student rate at the movie.. so 6.50 there.. and the fifteen was at gino's east for john's birthday.. so I don't regret that either.. I have a horrible tendency to spend too much on lunch at work though. if I don't go in to work, I usually don't even eat lunch. ugh..   work was mostly good today.. we should really put our noses to it when the bosses aren't there though to show we can do it and prove we don't need them around. we didn't today though.. that's for sure. it was just grep, alex, and myself (john took off for his birthday) we sat in the front of the store a lot. I think the first time we really did any work was when we were eating lunch we had to stop to get a rental together. heh. the last 45 min or so of work was kinda hectic. randy finally showed up and kinda rattled things a bit.. but whatever, right?    mike forgot his pin number. lol. poor mike. it'll be worked out tommorrow morning sometime.   it was fun going out for john's birthday. we got him to make use of his new age. don't worry. no one had more then one. "bring me another one of these"  I gotta be up around 8am to be at work by 10 so i think I'm gonna skedaddle..  "I'm from holland. isn't that weird?"

God bless you all,  the mentioned, and the unmentioned .

      ...and with a new determination he sets out to find that everything around him is as it was before.. but not allowing himself to be discouraged he states, "I will do it."  I will do what? habitat was good tonight.  I had to press through worship for a little bit. Jake started playing just the chorus and ending to love song by third day.. something started to stick. I ended up sitting on the floor with tears dripping as from a slow leaking faucet, which continued on into the next song. at some point I found a sense of determination rise up within me.. "I will do it" I think this is in response to another statement I found myself saying once.. it was at camp just however long ago that was.. wed night it was.. I was sitting there well into the altar time.. most people had left.. with my head on the back of the pew.. just sitting there.. I didn't know what to do.. as I was sitting there, dino came up and sat down in the row behind, and just rested his hand on my shoulder.. slowly I started breaking down.. it felt kind of like an emotional dump if that makes sense.. (not that kind of dump so much... well... maybe) I got to a point where I was saying, "why does it have to be me?" "all I've ever wanted is a simple life" "why does it have to be me?" and I cried and cried til.. I think I still had, and probably still have more to cry yet.. but it sort of subsided at least. so yeah..   life as it is right now is pretty crappy. I mean.. things are good, in that nothing is really bad right now.. but things just aren't very fulfilling.. I'm not finding myself in places I can really grow right now. I realize it's up to me to put forth the effort and take the repsonsibility for my own relationship with God.. and I know I haven't really excelled in that area..    I just feel like I'm stuck.    I'm making hardly enough to get by on.. partly even mostly because I find myself in a pit of debt with bills that I don't even always pay every month.. somehow I think to myself that if I can just get to my next pay check it'll get better.. I've yet to find  that  miracle pay check.   ministry.. well well, I run sound for three, that's right, three different ministries at two different churches. fym (youth) and habitat (young adults) at nwaog, and I started helping at souled out not too long ago. to be perfectly honest, I'm getting a little fed up with running sound at fym and even at habitat. fym just seems to be a hassle most of the time, and it doesn't feel like I'm really doing anything for habitat. I only had 1 microphone running through the board tonight.  ONE!!!  I've been considering leaving fym for a while now.. but there's no one else to really do it, and I don't want to just leave without there being someone else who can take over. part of me thinks there won't be until I leave and it forces someone to step up and take over.. I just hate to do it that way unless I know from God that's how it must be. habitat is just frustrating as far as being a part of it goes. the services can be good.. but I don't really feel like I'm a part of something that's moving growing et cetera... maybe it's all just me, and I gotta straighten some things out.. I just feel like there's nowhere else for me to go there. it really sux! souled out is interesting. I mean.. it was almost accident that I started helping there at all.. I'm glad I did, cuz if no other reason I started talking to cynthia some.. she's a cool girl, a rad chick if you will and I enjoy hanging out with her.  but as far as ministry goes.. I'm not sure that I'm really supposed to get any more involved there. they're going to be starting a young adult church on sunday mornings this fall sometime, and it intrigues me... I'm very interested to see what happens with it. it's exciting.. and so are the things that cynthia has talked about wanting to do.. it's exciting.. I want them to succeed, and I'm interested to see what happens.. does it go beyond that? I don't know. does it lead to God's will for me right now at this point in my life? I'm not sure I'm feeling a call for it.. but I'm very interested.. very. and ya know what's weird? I got online at work today.. headed on over to  urlLink 4amblue  and on into ryan, chuck, and jon's personal pages.. now I must admit that I heard a couple/few times this past week that jon is going to denmark.. but thought it was just a short trip.. maybe a month.. well he's leaving for  9 months  in less than a month. and my interest was sparked a little more for what might take place with the young adult church, and the worship team that will lead..  it's all so uncertain right now.. a person here, a person there; a group here, a group there; a church here a church there... but God.. you gotta work some financial miracles for me here.. I'm gonna try to be faithful with my money and tithing and giving and and and... please make good on me not being at a lack of resources.. I know that isn't exclusive to money.. but I could sure use some of those kind of resources about now.  girls.. well.. girl.. uhh.. you know what's funny? when I was really seeking God at camp.. trying to figure stuff out.. and I saw her pressing in after God.. I was never so happy ever.. never so wanting to find God's will for my life ever.. never so attracted to someone ever.. and never so easily hurt by what was done, or not done.. jess and davie can attest to the pain I bore that saturday night. I'm not too proud to admit I cried. though i may seem like a sally or something to some.. and I can only imagine what she might think if she read this..(I don't know if she ever does, but I'm bein' honest here) really I have no idea. I found out she started her own online journal.. (that's what I stumbled on to last night).. I left a comment to one of her entries.. I'm guessing she'll know it was me, though I signed with only an initial.. " love  s " I wonder what she thought about that.. as I'm sure she found it by now, though no response has issued forth as of yet. heh.. someone made the comment that I like jess the other night when I said something about having to call her.. I love jess.. she's my sister ("no she's not" "well I call her my sister") we talk about stuff. it's good. but liking her is not allowed. and even aside from it not being allowed.. I like someone else!  I think as far as girl goes...  maybe I'll just stop there.

      too lazy to fiddle with my teplate right now..  urlLink something I stumbled on to .. I need to take some time to work on my template.. another time though. I should be sleeping right now.. I gotta be up at 8 so I can make sure to get everything out of the motel room before I go to work. whatever. oh.. um.. no need to follow that link. it's mostly for my own reference. uh.. yeah. well.. sleep then g'night

      seems like everyone is getting fed up with things at windy city.  everybody gets annoyed with everyone else. I think it wouldn't be nearly as bad if we had some work to do. if we had stuff to do then we would all be busy and not have time to complain about other people not doing anything. it's just frustrating right now. plus it's really hard to justify asking for more money when in all honesty I know that we all spend most of the day sitting around complaining about work rather than actually doing anything.   jess comes home this weekend. :) she only gets to be here for a week and a half, and then she has to be off for auditions at isu. it'll be nice to see her again though, even for only a short time.  heh... john still doesn't realize...  heh  I gotta figure stuff out. ugh! guess I gotta put the prayer time in. it's hard to sit myself down and dig in. hasta happen though. it must! something good is gonna happen. everything in God's timing.

      last post.. the 3.. today.. the 12.. supposed to go see sleeping at last and the violet burning tommorrow night. I think john bobeng is going to spot me the funds for it. what a nice friend. I gotta somehow get there from work though and technically I'm not off of work until 30 min after the show starts. suck! hopefully something will work out. I'd love to see the violet burning.. maybe I won't though and that'll be okay. I've got like 19 dollars to last me until thursday after work and a lot of things to take care of once I get paid. ugh!   jess leaves wednesday for isu. it'll be sad to see her leave again so soon. she's only been home for about a week but she just seems such a part of everything it'll be weird for her not to be here. :(  slept through church this morning. I've been pretty good about going the past few weeks.. today just didn't happen. I played my guitar some this afternoon. started working on something new I kinda like. we'll see what happens with it. went over to stephen sandoval's for his going away party. it was good. it's kinda weird how much I'm a part of souled out. I don't really understand it.. or even know how much a part of it I am.. it's kinda cool.. but I don't quite get it.   saw daniela last night for the first time in... it has to be at least 2 1/2 months. :)   souled out was really good last night. really good. love. mike handler spoke at northwest tonight. really good. I remembered about 6:20. (20 min after service starts) I was there for the tail end of worship and got to hear everthing mike had to say. really good. love.  girls are weird.  at chuck's right now. it's been a pretty good time. watched some adult swim. ate some taco bell. did some catch up (ketchup.. catsup.. ketchup.. catsup) on internet stuff. (hadn't been on for nigh on a week)    got some work ahead of me.  love.

I just feel like I once knew how and have forgotten.. bah!   possibilities. in some ways I feel like I have lots.. in others.. dead ends.  it seems as though ministry ops are a plenty.. and actually increasing.. work.. some ways good.. windy city sucks.. whatever.. money is tight.. :P God will provide. he said he would. souled out.. habitat.. good things.. good things.. how much and to what extent? those are my questions.. ???   I gotta start writing here more again. it's good. working on a new song.. hope it turns out well.

      ugh!  I drove down into the city for what appears to be little reason whatsoever. after twenty minutes of driving around trying to find a place to park, I clicked on the emergency flashers, double parked and ran in to see what the scoop was.  all this to find out that they had been trying to call steve (the guy I was supposed to be filling in for) for the past three or four days to tell him they didn't need anyone to run sound tonight. what a smack in the face. burned much precious fuel to get down there and not make the 75 dollars I though I was going to be making tonight. the bar keep offered me a consolitory drink for driving down there, so I tried an amstel light and gave him my phone number in case they needed someone in the future. yes.. all while my van was precariously double parked at the entrance to an alley running behind the bar.   back to the burbs I headed with the thought that maybe I could at least get a hold of someone and do something tonight rather than just sitting at my house thinking about how I didn't make that much needed 75 dollars tonight. I actually just heard back from ted.. he and jake are playing pool at quentin corner. I passed, since I should really reserve spending any money, and ted is going straight home afterward so he can get some sleep.   my great rescuer has just called now. I'm headed over to the intern house to meet up with jess and do something. yay! I didn't tell you.. I was soo suprised when she came walking into northwest last night after habitat. unfortunately I was headed out to quencher's at the time to make some kiz-ash. definitely brightened my evening though.   and he's off...

      apparently there are people who actually look at my page on a near daily basis. amazing! sorry for the delay in posting.. between work, church, and the computer being where the rest of the fam sleeps.. I've been neglecting my precious people. for that I apologize. I have to be in the city in an hour to run sound at the underground lounge. (it's south of the metro on clark, for anyone who cares) it'll be my first time there, so I want to be early.. but I still have to shower, and I wanted to write something here to state what I've been up to and how I'm doing. things are going fairly well.. man.. it's been over a week since I last posted. that sux! we'll see how I feel when I get home tonight. God help me to be early for work in the morning. gotta run.. talk to you all soon. :)

      far too many days between posts.. I gotta get the computer downstairs fixed so I can internet from down there at almost anytime I want. (that's right.. I used internet as a verb)   work is.. well.. I don't think I want to get into it right now.. frustrating.. I'll leave it at that. I may have an opportunity to have a standing sound gig every friday night though. that would be cool. one more night that I can't do anything else.. but better than $200 a month extra for doing it. plus more experience running sound which brings more opportunities in the future. Monday and tuesday this past week at quencher's.. monday and wednesday next week. praise God.. I can sure use the extra cash. aside from bills I want to get some things straight in my room (the basement) which will require, not a ton, but a little bit of money. hopefully if things stay this busy with sound gigs.. I can save up to get some more equipment (music and sound) and maybe actually keep all my bills current. (including my car payments I owe my parents which I've been unable to pay the past two months)  gotta work with john on saturday came too soon stuff.. we're gonna have a show soon and I don't know his songs. I'm not worried, it should be fun. I have his crate amp over here now.. I shall have to play with that.. ooh.. bigger problem with scts stuff.. I don't have a bass or an amp.. hello local pawn shops and e-bay.. I need one cheap.  alright.. I need to shower.. then I'm off to hang with jeremiah.. later all

      appears that  urlLink mr. handler  has gotten himself a journal now. the number without is quickly being outweighed by the number with. just so long as this doesn't replace actual conversation it's all cool.  good service tonight at souled out. mr. ed talked about.. I forget the word he used.. it's like our mission or purpose in life.. and how everyone's is different from anyone else's. it was cool. I think it's sounding better in there all the time. still have some work to do with the systerm though. it'll get there sometime.  went to the new dunkin donuts/baskin robbins/togos on rand near target.  ice cream is good. unfortunately the people working there really only know donuts.. so they are a little slow. it'll come.  okay.. I'm really tired.. and need to get some sleep.. it's gonna be a long day tommorrow I fear. g'night everyone.

      I'm sitting about two feet lower than I usually do on a matress next to a sleeping five year old who's room is being painted. the fumes about knocked me off my feet when I came in the door.   jeremiah and I worked on this rad new song for a couple hours tonight. we have a great framework set down, and I think we're mostly done. he said he was gonna start layin' it down this week and hopefully I will be able to come over sometime this week to add my vocals to it. he'll probably just do all the guitar stuff. I wonder if he liked what I was playing for the verse? it's not difficult anyway. I got to hear a bunch of his stuff the other night that he's been putting together for his cd. it's really cool. I think he's gonna put this new one on there too, which aside from travis meeks, will make me the only additional artist mentioned.. hehe ;)    man.. the fumes are giving me a headache.. I may pass out soon if I don't get down to my room.. g'night all.

      I've gotta lot to spill.. unfortunately I can't really talk about all of it right now. suffise it to say that I, in addition to my bills and direction for the future(present) have another thing I'm praying for. I suppose it sort of goes along with direction.. probably in a huge way.. but that's really all I can say. I'm praying about it.   jeremiah is now officially 21. a few of us went to the loft about midnight to celebrate his birthday. twas fun twas fun.  God bless this guy. he confirmed some things I was thinking. plus we're working on some music stuff. very cool.   \w/ broadway \w/  still waiting to talk with ted. got tied up with things last night. almost falling asleep at the wheel tonight. tommorow is the promise. ted tends to make good on his promises.  I'm really missing talking to jess right now. the past couple days when I've been on-line.. she hasn't. maybe I'll try to call her sometime soon. this internet thing is cool but it's just not the same as a real conversation.  I really need to be sleeping right now.. but I have to much running through my head. suck! well.. it's good stuff..it's just I need to be sleeping...  got some cool stuff coming on the guitar.. perhaps I'll try to read for a little bit and then attempt sleeping again. I can't be late for work.. gotta be on high alert in that concern. God.. I love you.. teach me, lead me, reside with me...

      first things first..  God is good. I love him a lot. here's a couple of the most recent reasons...  1) my mom is doing much better. she's actually home now. she is a little frustrated with my brothers..(take the hint if you read this to make extra effort in helping out) but she's home. :)  2) Margaret. :) (she's my girlfriend now ya know)  3) though I was home because my mom was sick.. I was able to spend some time with my brothers, which was cool. I wish I had been able to talk with dad some more.. but he's been soo busy lately. I hope he's getting enough rest.  4)  saturday came too soon  first ever show.. Friday October 4, 2002 at Roselle United Methodist Church. I'll get the actual address posted up here. show starts at 8.. (doors.. 7:30) (for those that don't know.. scts is John Bobeng   Ted Leonteos  and myself  it's gonna rock!  okay.. I gotta get ready for work so I can be there on time.. I'll try to get to this more again..I'm trying..

I'll leave this short.. but the reason I'm going is to see my mom 'cuz she's in the hospital right now.. any prayer would be appreciated..

      has it really been a whole week since I wrote.. dang! well.. my birthday was yesterday. it was pretty good. work was kinda draining.. but I left early came home took a shower and got myself all dolled up. that's right complete with shirt tie and jacket.. I was stylin' I took a change of clothes for afterward though. white t-shirt jeans and of course my chucks. I forgot my belt(the one with the whale buckle) but I got by okay.   Margaret planned this whole thing.. it was so sweet of her. well first she got me another black sweatband(this one has a star on it) and some blacklight bracelets with a manly pink card. but after habitat she had bought a cake and ice cream and gloria's mom had done the same for her(her b-day is today) it was soo nice. after I got my van loaded for my show tonight Margaret gave me my "real" gift. she bought me a toaster oven. she is amazing. never had I specifically said that I wanted one for my birthday but she picked it out because of a conversation we had. talk about well thought out. I must have the best girlfriend ever.  so yeah.. john ted and I have a show tonight at the fishbowl coffee house (206 rush st. roselle illinois.. roselle united methodist church) it's gonna be a lot of fun. looks like a lot of people are coming out to see us play. what great friends we have!  I have some stuff to take care of so have a great day everyone.. God bless.

      such support i get from my friends. yeah.. it's completely different from what I'm doing now, but from what I'm told I can make good money as a claim adjuster. and since I'd be working for an insurance  company, I'm sure I would get some good benefits. I just gotta get out of this place. I can't take being here for a much longer. on the bright side, it looks like it won't be a problem for me to have monday dec. 23 off as well as christmas eve. that means I can be in WI the whole weekend. I'll probably stay to see the play at nwaog sat the 21, and leave either late that night or early on the 22. I'll miss Margaret, I know. but it will be okay. we decided today that we'll celebrate christmas on the 26. that works out well since it's our 3 month anniversary that day. it's so boring at work today. there's not really anything to do. I'm sure I could "find" something to do, some "menial" task that some 16year old monkey could perform more than sufficiently. what a waste of my time. God, I hope this claim adjuster thing works out, and that it's something I can take pleasure in doing. I need to lose some weight too. it looks like a swallowed an elf for crying out loud! I think the main thing is I need to stop drinking so much pop. it's so bad for me. let's go through the different jobs I've had...  renk corn detassler 3 days seasonal cornfest(manual labor, runner) 3 times seasonal warming house supervisor 3 mo seasonal bike shop(mechanic) 3 wk poor work environment, wasn't taught needed information/sufficiently grocery bagger and stock associate 3 yr left for school library 1 yr stopped attending platteville lemstone(retail sales assoc) 3 wk nsf busse car wash(vacuumed cars) 6 wk nsf office max(sales assoc, sales clerk) 7 mo went home from school(school year ended) mccullough(office staff) 1 1/2 yr moved old navy(retail sales assoc) 9 mo went home from school(school year ended) windy city(shipping manager, rental assoc, manual labor) 15mo nsf, poor working environment, not taught sufficiently to do job with excellence ??? claim adjuster ???

      It's nice to have a day off.  I'm going down to navy pier with margaret and a couple of friends to see libido funk circus. it's this band margaret saw a couple years ago and really wants me to see them.  memorial day was good. lots of food and drink and time spent with good friends; always a good experience.  I have to hit the road...

      starting over has become a new pastime for me.   in some form or another I seem to be...  starting over with margaret. starting over with God. starting over with my band. starting over with music. starting over with on-line diary-dom. starting over with a new address. starting over with friends I haven't talked to in too long. trying to start over with a new job. not having any luck.(though that may be changing. please God make it clear) and I always seem to be starting over with my finances.  ...hopefully I can learn to keep on and stop taking a mulligan on everything over and again.
