      yeah yeah yeah i know "but why dont you write" you say clearly bewildered by my lack of consistancy. my only reply is to say that life blows and that normally that would be my entire blog. however seeing as this is mine and i want to write that wont be it and i will now proceed to write a long detailed account of how and why my life blows, and you of course will groan and leave this ridiculusly boring blog in search of something more interesting. however i will be happy so... *imitating one of those people from forever ago* ITS 9:00 AND ALLS WELL! anyway, # one bad thing- im in Mississippi. that blows. and may i just state that the water here is YELLOW. therefore i will become dehydrated and die before i get out of here. however i must say that we've found the secret of real sweet tea. it is wonderful and yes i am going to rub this in your face. another thing- ive gotten a total of two emails, and zero letters. funny, cuz i wrote everyone and you all promised you would write me. isnt it weird- out of sight out of mind. my new school is huge theres like six buildings and a billion people. i sit with a couple people at lunch but its weird- ever since my first day they've completly ignored me. its like- during class its okay just so they have somthin to do, but out of class they dont know me. however i've been noticing how incredibly self involved i am. why didnt you all tell me? basically the only people who talk to me are guys who flirt with me cuz im the cute new girl. note to everyone: i am the cute new girl (in other words im cute isnt that joyous*sarcasm drips*)  i got my care bear dvd, but its actually a video cd and its obviously pirated material(its from singapore) but at least it made me smile. i'm lonely and i hate it here and its boring, but the least anyone could do is write me, and dont give me the "you never gave me your adress" junk, cuz i did and you and i both know it. so write me or call me or email me or  something cuz i am alone and your not and therefore i take preference

      Life blows. Thats my viewpoint. i'm in computer (2rd hour) and i can't stand it. All that i can think about is the fact that this is my last friday, and tomorrows the last saturday and so on. 6 days. It keeps pounding through my brain and its never gonna stop. i am disgusted that my parents are thinking only about themselves and not at all about how it effects me. It sucks and thats all im sayin

      well im back and i hate this. my computer wont let me check my email im alone im crying again life blows oh and all these major things keep happening back home and i am here and i just want to rewind five years and relive everything so differently and cherish every moment. i just read one of my most cherished friends blogs and i just started crying because shes doing so much that i should be there for like picking out dresses for her first high school dance, and i should be there helping instead of her family.  and all of everyone write and theyre so happy and im not and it sucks majorly. i had a big long blog planned out with lost of positivety in it but i cant write that im not lying anymore. it sucks and thats it.kaity i ate peanut butter pie for you and it made me sick. i hugged a tree for kenj and got bugs in my hair. i met the most perfect guy in the world and i cant have him and now im alone and i have tearstreaks and theres nothing i can do to make it go away. Val you keep telling me to try and be friendly and that  i shouldnt keep my "wonderful personality" to myself but it goes most ways sweetheart. a direct quote would be "Im a social reject even among the band geeks so i got the whole day to myself just me...and my cd player". honey if you wont try in a safe enviroment then you shouldnt tell me to here.  i love you

      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sorry i am disgusted at the world. I was reading some blogs from people at my friends church (i know its none of my business, but if you don't want me to know dont put it on my effing internet) and the things people say are just insane. i mean guilt trip guilt trip guilt trip. then add in a heap of hate and undeserved loyalty and you have these blogs. i mean first its i hate this church cuz of all the things they did. then its lets be loyal to the church. then its well i tried a new church but i still want loyalty to my own church. and in the latest one, apparently someone told the the other that they didnt want them at the church and so on a guilt trip thing they decided because of that they are going to stop going to church all together. what is that? i dont know it just seems kinda useless to me. are you going to church for the social scene or to worship God? I'm sorry if this offends anyone. thats not the goal. i have too much spare time on my hands and i'm trying to keep my mind off of my own pathetic life. so if you want to hate me forever for this then tell me and i will retract my thoughts forever. whatever anyway, monday night. schools easy (see look thats more positive then school blows). its great though my math class is still teaching for the first time the stuff that mr. parker taught us way back in 8th grade. and yet i still only got a 97 on the math test. oh well. anyway as my new found positivity ends here i think i will go. I miss you i love you thats all except WRITE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      well its monday. now i have to go back to that crummy place they call school. however i'm working on the positive attitude thing. i talked to one of the most wonderful people yesterday and i promised i would try. i hate trying. once again i am working for someone else, but thats okay because i don't mind doing stuff for my friends. NOTE: i recieved 1 letter and multiple emails. *Turns to the heavens and sings, "HALELUIA!"* i have to go and be vain and self centered again (in other words i'm doing my hair) hugs  God bless

      I hate hate hate hate hate myself! why does everything i do have to effect others? why do i have to always make everyone cry? DONT CRY OVER ME!!!! IM NOT WORTH IT!!! Kaity darlin i luv ya. dont waste your life trying to be my best friend when you've got all these great oppertunitys ahead of you. but dont forget about me and write me everyonce in a while because im all alone out here and its boring without you. i hate this! everyone always says they miss me and they feel bad for me, but i dont see why. i feel bad for them. i wedged my way into their life, and when the tide changed i had to leave again, and they hurt more than i do. i'm okay with being alone, but i hate that every one else has to be too. i wish i could just stay in my little hole and never come out so that no one would worry about me.  look at me rambling on about myself again. i am the most incredibly self involved person i know. all i talk about is me me me. i wish i would shut up. my current philosiphy on life: it sucks. dont bother pretending that you're independent. you arent. your parents force you to do what you dont want to do. so does your school. when you get out of that, your boss tells you what to do. and even if you're the biggest baddest dude on earth you still have God rulin over you. you cant do what you want its never about you. so just give up. oh and there is no real world. its a mirage. we go through every day and in the morning we wake up and feel pretty good. then we look in the mirror. I hate this. i hate everyone except a select 8 people. you all know who you are. all the rest of you bite me

      lonelyness overrules everything else so now i lay me down to sleep and.... oh there used to be people reading this crap. well i am not insane just bored and lonely again. i just saw a new strong bad email that reminded me so much of home. kaity if you havent already check out the strongbad email entitled monument. you'll see why anyhoo my sister is screaming again and lying about needing the internet to do homework, but i intend to ignore her as all she really wants to do is talk to her boyfriend-which i have no objection to as long as its on her own time. so instead i'll sit here and catch up on the like 50 or so strongbad emails which i have missed. serves her right for not ever letting me check my email(i cant on my dads laptop). anyway i am sad becuz i jsut found out that no one is coming to visit me this summer. they say next year but by next year they'll barely remember who i am. somebody will be like "remember that one chick who used to hang around us" and somebody else will go "oh yeah she moved to like maryland or somethin" and then they'll all shrug and do something else. im not bitter just alone forever.  ya know what sucks the most is that my dad said i had a choice but when i was there and i did have a choice about leavin, i didnt get a choice. it justs sucks i want my friends. i hate this crummy place. i'm gonna go do something now

      hey i just felt like mentioning that i thought of a positive of all this hell Lynn is putting me through. i am now single by choice rather than just undesirable. so hah. by the way just an update, i said no and the next day he asked me again and so now i wont speak to him and i know i should be christian and forgive and forget, but i cant so i say forget him.  by the way have you ever been to a crawfish party? its hilarious! imagine thirty pounds of crawfish on garbage sacks on the ground and all these high schoolers kneeling and just shoveling these things up!absolute hilarity

      grrr. life is all going downhill. i have to catch a bus in about ten minutes to go to school, where i will proceed to take state test needed to graduate which i am not prepared for, and i will reject the first boy who has ever asked me out and in doing so lose a great friend. you would be confused at this point which is not surprising as i dont write in this thing so i will explain. this guy lynn at my new school was getting to be a good friend but now he asked me out. i feel no attraction to him at all and i still dont know how to reject him without hurting his feelings. this is probably mostly my fault as i give all of my friends frequent hugs when i see them and it probably led him to believe i was attracted to him too, but im not and i have a bus to catch so in closing i will say that you really should be at home to recieve my phonecalls when i'm going through a crisis

      darn it. i just wrote like a super long blog and my compy malfunctioned and erased it. so heres the jist: we had a tornado drill today. they make you sit in the hall with your back to the lockers (like that'll do any good). there isn't enough room in the freshman hall for all the kids, so i figured that if someone had to die it might as well be someone unhappy, so to traumatise everyone i decided instead of trying to bbe safe i'd just run up to the windows and be impaled on a piece of shattered glass making everyone be afraid of windows. i wish i could go home and its very sad that my hopes lie on someone unemployed and broke buying a plane and flying me out here. i despretly need a hug because this chick made fun of me for my veggietales cd. i miss you i have homework so i have ot go. luv ya

      I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t feel up to it. I wish I could say that I feel fine physically at least, if not mentally or spiritually, but I can’t. I’m having a breakdown, I’m continually going into states of depression, and to top it all off, I’m sick. I don’t even know why I’m sick, but I’ve had a constant pain in my stomach since Wednesday night. It won’t go away, and it doesn’t get better or worse from eating or the lack thereof. What makes it worse is that my parents don’t even believe that I’m not well. They’re like, she’s just faking it and stuff, but it’s spring vacation, and there would be no point in wasting fake sickness to get out of nothing. It’s completely real and without explanation, and all that I can come up with is that the hole where everything I cared about was ripped apart is finally showing signs of not being immune. And I’m sorry that I’m not good enough to be okay with this. I tried I really did. I just can’t handle being alone all the time and never having anyone to talk to, never having anyone to get hugs from. I’m sorry but I can’t handle being away from you guys because you were my support system, and my shoulder to cry on, and your home was my home basically. I felt more comfortable with you then I ever did with my own family. And now that’s all gone. At first I thought that it was a spiritual thing for me to have to leave because I depended on you all as a reason to even bother going to church every Sunday and Tuesday. I hated going anywhere alone, if you remember. I even refused to go eat lunch alone at school. But now I’m all alone and when the weekends over, there’ll be people again, but they won’t be people who get me or who care, and they won’t be people I know. They definitely won’t be you. But really my spirituality philosophy doesn’t make sense cuz this is one of those times when God seems so far away and everything seems so pointless. Isn’t one of the things you’re supposed to have ‘fellowship with believers’? lets face it  everyone who I’ve talked to here doesn’t and nobody who does cares to get to know me, and you all are just going to tell me to try harder, and then everyone here tells me to try harder, and all you want me to do is be more like you and I can’t because I’m me and every once in a while somebody else has to try. I’m sick of trying. So I’m sorry that I can’t be happy to be here, and that I can’t appreciate the “opportunity”, but the only opportunity I want is an opportunity to go home and I can’t. so I’m just sick of it all. I would end this entry by telling you not to worry about me and that I’ll be okay, but occording to you all, that just makes you worry more, so instead I’ll end by telling you to pray for Val to have a safe trip home from Florida, and be pleased with myself because I said something that had nothing to do with me.

      okay i over exagerated from what i knew to be true in my last couple blogs. okay i exagerated a lot. for all i know my letters never got there and you cry everyday. okay that is not true either. but now i am really feeling gone becuz i just read one of the people who really impacted my lifes blog and she was telling about her life, and well i was mentioned three times. once there was a reference to "this one girl named cheryl" and again "this cheryl girl" and lastly "then i became popular and left cheryl in the dust". i mean i should know that i won't show up in life stories much becuz my parents keep making me move away from everything before we can make important stories and memories. but honestly this is one of the people i respect most in the world, and i know if i wrote something about everything important that happened in my life, she would be spoken about over and over again. she impacted me so much with her faith and how easily ministry came to her. i had a hard time even explaining what i was reading in reference to my bible. but i guess it makes sense that you cant impact greatly in five years, especially when you're someone whos kinda softspoken except to b***** a lot. which i do. anyway this isnt a guilt trip thing and if you're gonna take offense at my journal thingy then you shouldnt be reading it. and as i know someone will bring this up, i wasnt taking offense at that i was just considering how i have wasted my lif eby not touching anyone. sad pathetic and all that

      well. bored and alone. whats new. i wonder if anyone actually reads this anymore i mean i don't talk about anything i dont say anything except to whine about how alone i am. maybe i should just quit with the blog thing. i mean firstly i dont have the time, and also nobody reads it anymore anyway. i mean i know that life continues without me, but it just seems like the memories and friendships fade so fast. i mean at first when we got letters, we read them with such joy and sat down to answer with long detailed replies, but then it took a few days to reply, and when it was done it was a bit shorter then it had been before. and now it's been a few weeks since i replied from the last letter, and as far as i know there was a blizzard in which everyone died. then theres the people who dont really seem to care much whether we stay in touch. ya know, the type of people who you bump into on IM everyonce and a while and the conversation goes something like:"hi!" "HI" "how are you" "im okay just missin you." "oh" long silence. someone says"well i gotta go" some one else says "byebye email me", and you never here from then until the next random time. so now i'm like a memorial entry in their blogs dated long ago that they dont really remember even writing. eventually i'll get a generic card on my b-day and then nothing at all, and everyonce in a while someone will say "hey remember that one chick?" and everyone will say oh yeah her what was her name again?" and the conversation will switch topics again. kinda sad, but i guess you should put things in the past and move on to now. it's just that now kinda sucks. oh its my sister birthday today. she's seventeen. whoopee. she got a digital camera (a really nice top model one). as a consulation, i guess for them liking her better then me, i got printer paper. yay. i feel so loved. its like really late and theres school tomorrow, so i gotta scoot God bless HeroX PS: NinjaX rox my sox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      choking blub blub or possibly drowning i cant tell. i swear this is what hell is going to be like. so hot it makes you nauseaus and so much humidity that you can barely breathe and when you do, you can feel the water filling up your lungs. honestly, i'll be one of those unsolved mystery deaths. "girl dies from water filled lungs miles from nearest water source". i miss my dry heat and freezing cold home! I love you IDAHO!!!! i want to be there without water filled lungs. Anyhoo, i am still happy cuz i get to talk to my krissy via IM. Also i have new clothes, a puppy (stuffed but it looks real :)), and of course my pretty converse. They're pink hightops and so so cool! plus they are part of our revolution against anarchist who use their mothers credit cards to buy their "punk rawk" gear. well that might be what its against we are too  confuseded to tell. (sorry im stealing krissys words) anyway my family is at this block party but i was nauseous from the heat and all the southerners, so i left. anyhoo, running away everyone write in the bloggys

      well i havent written in a while so i'll backtrack. umm on wednesday (thats as far back as i remember), i went to the ortho and he said that my teeth have shifted so that the only way to fix them is braces again, which especially blows because if we were still back home, it would be free as we paid my old ortho in the beginning and, as it wasnt anything i did, would have fixed them. also on wednesday, i went to get my reportcard (98, 100, 98, 100, 93) and i ran into this guy who i really like. unfortunatly, he has a girlfriend, and i have a commitment i made to myself to wait until i was ready to think about major commitments (like marriage) before i started dating or got attached to anyone. by the way this is the guy i've mentioned in multiple blogs, on may 11, he was the guy who i mentioned, and earlier i mentioned my "husband", thats also a reference to him. but even though i know it could never happen, i still really like him. i mean i know part of it is physical attraction; i mean, the boy is seriously dreamy, but i know theres something else there. i suppose its partly because i only feel accepted when i get actual signs of it, which always used to be hugs, and he always gave me those, and i dont know, i guess i felt special, which is kinda dumb cuz he hugs all the girls. i guess im just stupid so you all can ignore my rambling on stupid stuff that doesnt really matter. on thursday, i did...nothing. i threw my bouncy ball around. whoopee! (Sarcasm exudes from my countenece, if you couldnt tell) well friday was pretty cool, though. my sister helped my clean up my room. (yes it is clean. i know you said not to, but i need the money). for once, we actually got along. then we went out with brandon(seeing as you dont know brandon is this sofmore who's really my sisters friend, but we get along). we were supposed to go to this nifty coffee shop to listen to this band, but there were like ten zillion people there, so we called my mum and decided to go bowling instead. however, when we got there, it was really crowded and we would have had to wait for like half an hour to even get a lane, so we said forget it, and we went to walmart instead. bad thing was, we didnt ask my mum this time. fortunatly we didnt get cought, which is really only fortunate for my sis, as i dont care. i mean what are they going to do, ground me? which by the way is actually kinda funny, as theres nothing to ground me from but church i guess, and they wouldnt do that. ( i know, you're thinking but she just said she went out and now she says she doesnt have a life, but this was a once only special). so really its my sister who loses. but it was kinda funny, as me and her actually got along. it was pretty nifty. anyway, today all the sisterly love was gone and shes back to hatin, but i'll live. anyway not much more to say, although technically im only writing all this down because i just read a scary book and dont want to sleep cuz, well, number one, im afraid of the dark, and also i dont want night mares. so now i'm going to read another book and see if that helps and if not i'll be sleepy in the morning. big effing deal. anyway hugs and all that God bless Cheryl

      well summer is dull. even throwing things is boring. however i did get a package from Val today, and it was just too sweet. i would have cried if i wasnt smiling so much. honestly, you know me too well. i suppose its partly because i am not a very deep person. i've found it suits me to just be open and happy all the time. people tend to like that. also its partly because we spent so much time together. those were the days. if everyone would take a moment now to reminise (i wont tell you what to remenise about *cough*me*cough* ;) ) i would be much abliged. anyway hugs to all and many thanks to Val, although i was a bit concerned that that ice cream wrapper wasnt enclosed. i hope the mail people didnt lose it. i was very disapointed ;) Hugs and lots of love Cheryl

      blah. well school is terrible, but home is boringer. so now i have just a few things to get off my chest. adressing Val: You cut your hair?! i am absolutely devastated, not really that you cut it, but that i wasnt consulted, or even informed until afterwards. i want to be there. (okay technically i shouldnt be yelling at you as this isnt any fault of yours, i just really miss being there.) Adressing Kristin: How dare you say that you love him?! he is satan incarnate! he is a bad word which i dont choose to put here. i'll leave you to come up with which one fits properly. you better be effing joking cuz we talked about this and you agreed!!!! adressing everyone who hasnt struck a nerve recently: I love you heaps, now write me loads of letters! now as for my life, it is boring, and i spend a lot of time making dents in my walls with my bouncy ball. for all who are interested, it is my half of the GAY set (GReen And Yellow). also my half is the yellow and kaitys is the green. these were bought at the gas station on the corner near shelley high school on January 22, 2004 (moving day, life ruining day, whatever you want to call it). just a little background for those who didnt really care i love you God bless L

      well i have a few months before the next torture session begins. (in other words, school is out) ok technically today is the last day, but i'm not there so for me its over. hmmm i believe this counts as sluffing. its my first time YAY! but its not much better at home except i got to sleep in till 9:30 today which really got my brain all screwed up but was much better then waking up at 4:30. but my mom finds it her duty to make my life as miserable as possible by getting on my case as soon as i got up. "go clean your room" "turn off the tv" "be miserable" okay she didnt actually say the last one but i could feel it. well at first i hoped i would find something good about moving here, but i've searched and theres nothing. i'm losing contact with all my friends, i;ve gained 15 pounds and look a bit like a snowman, i'm completely alone, and my faith has suffered a lot. its really bad and i hate it. i mean it would be easier if there were something to look forward to, like getting to see you again or visit or something, but i'm basically garunteed a lonely summer where i dont talk to anyone. basically i'll leave the house for church and to buy new clothes for next years wardrobe and thats it. speaking of next years clothes, ive decided that my wardrobe will consist mainly of white grey and black, with only hints of color. this will signify how void of happyness and color and stuff my life is. of course my parents will throw a fit, but there isnt much they can do. my mum thinks i overexagerate how bad i feel, and my dad never sees it because i pretend a lot so people dont freak out. anyway my life is boring but i still have to clean my room so i guess i'll go. hugs and lots of love L

      yay i get to talk to kaity!!! ultimate joy, although it seems like everyones life has changed a lot. kaity and krissy hang out with joel, who is dying from mds (mysterious dying syndrome- i dont get it but whatever), the old calvary youth group has split up and basically died out, and there appears to be a lot of dissension in the ranks. it really sucks that we all got split up and the this happens. i wish things hadnt changed. so anyway there is a lot going on but everyone knows something and nobody knows everything so i'll just remind you instead that there are only 5 days left of school. so ha now i can sit at my parents house and daydream about home. anyway life is gray and void of color so take care cheryl

      blah i hate this. oh well. 6 days HAHA! we get out of school first. of course i have no plans but at least i dont have to see all those nimrods i go to school with. yeah. thats good. of course my walls will probably end up with dents in them from me becoming so bored that the only source of entertainment is attempting to knock myself unconscious against the walls. okay ya know i feel a complete apathy towards the world, so i think i will go before i make everyone mad. hugs from missississippi

      well i managed to sneak on the internet now, as my sister finally went to sleep. she has some paper to write which she put off to the last minute so now im forbidden  to be on the internet until she's done but shes asleep and i dont care what my parents say. they moved me to missississippi. well we had a choir concert tonight. it was okay i guess. kinda pathetic though. everyone was crying cuz it was our teachers last concert as she is retiring and also we had senior walkout. i didnt cry though until afterwards when i was told i couldnt go online. i did think of something funny though. Mrs. sawyers retiring. Mrs. hawkers being fired. there is a woman applying for the choir job. wouldnt it be a hilarious coinkidink if...? anyway im okay tonight cuz i just stopped talking to two of my favorite people, one of whom i havent spoken to at all since we moved to this hole. so i luv you guys and thanks a million trillion for reading. I love you way more than my luggage. hugs and a very blessed night cheryl

      god i am so sick of this. i just got on and now i have fifteen freaking minutes to inform you about this crap i call life. is it wrong to hate like your family? cuz i do. i cant help it and this isnt some teen angst crap. im bloody serious. but thus is life so forget it.  anyway im really psycho at the moment for various reasons which, due to my sister not ever being prepared, i cant go into, but some of them definitely revolve around lonelyness. our choir class is singing all these love songs and stuff, and all i can think about is that that wont ever happen to me. i hate it. i really want to feel needed and loved again. i felt so secure so happy before we left and i knew people cared about me and now i;ve got zip. i really need a chocolate and caffeine high. by the way, wouldnt you think that when a guy holds your hand in public, he probably likes you?

      i dont think i can take this anymore. i know we only have nine days left of school and all, but its not even about that. i just feel so alone and i can't stand it. i mean i have no real friends. the only person who wants to be my friend is Gabby and honestly i wish she would just leave well enough alone. but i hate being alone so much as you know. you remember the days when i wouldnt eat lunch cuz no one would go through the lunch line with me. it was great, but now i've lost everything. i just wish i could go back and quit complaining about everything i had before it was too late. i see all these old women on tv and they cry about their childhood traumas and low self esteem and i see myself 12 years from now. i'll cry a whole lot and say that January 22 2004 ruined my life. thenm i'll tell them how lonely i was and how i didnt have a date all through highschool. but i wander. anyway i just wish i could see you and tell you one last time how much i love you and how much you mean to me. ya know those stupid forwards that talk about what if yyuo never got to tell someone how much they mean to you? it finally applys but now its too late to do a thing about it. so on this light note, i bid you farewwell. Hugs to all i love, and to all i hate, may acidic snails eat through your brake pedals. (the only hateds are my family and mississsissippians) Cheryl

      i know i should be getting ready for school k? i just dont want to go and have to face all that crap again. i think school is the one place i hate more than here. here at least everyone leaves well enough alone and i dont have to see everyone being all happy when i'm so not happy. i hate it. i really have no friends except gabby and i honestly would rather be alone then be friends with her. but if i wasnt friends with her all of my other supposed "friends" would ditch me, even my husband (lonnngg story tell you later).  i dunno i think what bugs me the most is that my parents said that i had a choice after we got here. well let me tell you something mom and dad, i didnt have a choice cuz if i did i would have chosen to keep my life minus you. and to tell you the truth i wouldnt miss you all that much. sorry to burst your bubble.

      well i finally figured out who that nasty comment was from, but i'm gonna let it go as there is a small chance i might be wrong.  anyway life is boring. we finally got a walk to remember, and my mom is freaking cuz i've watched it like 6 times in the last 4 days. however the library still doesnt have gone with the wind, and that irritates me to no end. i really want to watch it because it peeves my family, and also because its a great movie. however i dont know if i could sit through it because i've had about enough of the south as i can handle. but then again, the south pictured in gone with the wind is different then the south im in so i might be able to stand it. anyway not much to say. luv and blessing to you all L

      well life is dull. however im happy to say i patched up things with kaity. while i still worry about her, and she has another issue on my permanent prayer list(she was there before, but this gets added), i am genuinely happy for her. thanks to all who sent their support. however, whoever left the nasty comment, let me just say to you that if you had any guts, you would leave your name. as i have large doubts that i know who you are, i would like to inform you that you dont know crap about the situation, i cant tell her because i respect the other person involved's privacy, i know without a doubt that she doesnt know, its my business cuz shes my friend who i care a lot about, and i've said everything i could, but even i know that my word means nothing to this situation. oh and i'm sure your grammer is perfect when you're upset. anyway, i had a bunch more to say, but my sister wants the internet, and my dad takes her side always, so i have to go, but i love you all. oh and big hey to Shawn (should i say pastor Fanchette, as i dont know you very well?). apparently he just started reading my bloggy so smiles to you luv and all that stuff L

      oh god i think im in shock. what do you do when you find out that your oldest friend is going out with the only person in the world that you truly hate and you're too far away to stop it? you cant enlist help from your other friends, they're preoccupied with other things and other people. ya know im lying to myself. i could stop it just with a few words explaining why i hate him. but i wont,  because i respect someone elses privacy. but i cant live with myself knowing that i might stop her from getting hurt if i tell her. i never wanted to tell anyone what i know about him though, because i dont want to believe that its true, but its not something anyone would lie about. however i dont know if she'll even listen anymore cuz we had a big fight about my being far too honest and her calling it rude because its negative. then she got mad about me badmouthing him and it slipped abou them being together. but im not feeling exactly priviliged to be one of the people who know. i cant take this, knowing that they're together, and aparently hes all over her, which just makes me sick, and i could stop it but wont beecause of loyalty to someone else. all i really can do now is pray. darlin, you'll probably read this so i just want to ask you to take heed of my warnings and please please just be careful. dont let him too close. if you want to talk you know im always here May Gods will be done in this terrible situation L

      oh lord i think i may be in shock. what do you do when your oldest friend starts going out with the one boy you hate and you're too far away to do a thing about it? this is really really bad. its the first time i've ever wanted to tell someone what i know about him and i cant and its killing me. i mean what if my telling her could keep her from getting hurt, and i dont and she does get hurt? i'll carry that guilt with me for the rest of my life. however i dont know if anything i do will help anymore. we fought and she seems to hate me now. apparently my negativity is rude, which is not really suprizing but she didnt have to give me more proof that my life is terrible and out of my control. honestly i really dont feel special to be in the group of people who know instead i feel like curling up and playing dead. i dont know what to say that isnt negative, isnt hurtful, isnt insulting to him because he deserves to be insulted, deserves to be hung by his earlobes and thrown darts at until he is in serious pain. see the thing is, i saw what he did to my sister. i didnt know why she was like that at the time, but i do now and it wasnt pretty. she told me part of it, i found out the real truth for myself. now i am bound to secrecy, partly cuz she doesnt know how much i know. i wish i didnt know. for once i want to tell, but telling makes it real and i dont want it to be real. darn it i cant do anything from this far away and my other friends wont do anything (i know i called and asked but they were preoccupied cuz they had company). however i did find out that he always has his hands on her and it just makes me sick that he would think about being with her. you realize that hes much older than you dont you?  i dont know what to do but pray about it because i dont thinik it matters what i do anymore. i just want you to know that even if you hate me, i still care about you. if you ever want to talk without getting mad cuz im honest, then email me, im me, or give me a call. i've noticed that you dont really care to write me, seeing as i never recieved a letter or email since we got here from you, but please just take a minute to try to look through his facade. please just listen to me L

      Grrrr! I hate all phone companies!!! I think we should revolutionize that! They shut down our cell phones last night and I couldn’t make my weekly phone call!! It really blows. Of course, it was kinda my families fault, seeing as my sister got like $170 in overage charges cuz shes too stupid to realize we don’t have unlimited minutes, and then my parents, for unknown reasons which can only be that they enjoy ruining my life, didn’t pay the bill until the late notice that said they could shut down the phones came in. but it bit especially since I missed my weekly phone call to Kenj and Val. Seriously this is traumatizing cuz it means it will be over a week until I talk to someone outside of my family again. So big apologies. I’ll try calling someone tomorrow cuz my family drives me nuts. So everybody change your plans so that I can call you! J  I do feel a bit better though cuz I made cupcakes and they turned out just beautifully. They were chocolate with chocolate frosting and mega big chocolate chips on top. Of course the whole chocolate cupcake thing made me all weepy again because I kept remembering the lovely tower we made out of mini cupcakes and I just wish could do that again cuz it was wasome good fun. What wasn’t good fun though was my mum waking me up by announcing that the phones worked again. I mean whoopdeebloodydoo. What do I care it’s a bit late, seeing as the only time val is ever home is on Wednesday and its fun talking to two people at once. So anyway love to everyone Toodles Cheryl (please pray that I don’t throttle my sister)  okay well all that was supposed to go in yesterday. Actually technically it should have gone in Wednesday, but I have a very inconsiderate family. For the second night in a row my sister got online at around seven and stayed on past 11:30. I don’t what past means as I for one have a reasonable hour for sleeping which is preferably an hour and a half before this. As she is the cause of me not being able to speak to my friends, I do not tolerate well her habit of possessing the phone line at all hours of the night, seeing as that is the time I have chosen to update. Anyway just a brief explanation of how this came to be in the wrong place which is of course because of my sisters selfishness.

      well my sisters back. still not sure how i feel about that. i mean, on the plus side, my parents attentions are focused entirely on me. however, that also means that none of my parents attention is on me.&nbsp; but hey i can live with that. i dont know. when she got back i just had a big upset last night. normally i'm good at hiding how i feel, i wait until i can get to my room to be angry or sad or whatever, but since she brought her boyfriend and he's in her room, i have to share my room with her and get no privacy whatsoever. (i don't ever recall agreeing to letting her stay in my room. as i recall, i said i liked having two beds so that if one of MY friends came down, they'd have a place to stay) so anyway last night i was upset and not hiding it very well, so, either out of curtesy or just so i'd look like a brat, my sister slept on the couch last night. i was kinda thankful for that cuz it gave me time to get a good cry in, but i felt bad too. i was kinda rude to her last night(not on purpose for once). i think i called her insensitive. but there were reasons. i guess it kinda struck me that it had been six months since i'd been home.i was freaking out, and she didn't have the decency to take a picture of even one of my friends, or tell me they asked about me, or at the very least say that they were happy and looked well. i know she was cought up in other things but she should know that i've been gone for as long as she has. what grated on my nerves the most was that the second she got back she started complaining about it being too short. i just wish she'd realise that she got two weeks plus ten days here with todd, and i would shave my head if it meant i would get to see even one of you for just one more day.  anyway, shes back and still alive. fun little update right hugs L

      well first off, tanky oi to krissy for the lovely comments. i am pleased to know that you all got my gifts, although i must say the ocean-noise-hearing was an added bonus that i didnt know about :P anyhoo, i am pleased out of my mind because i am definitely definitely getting a guitar for my birthday! its red and that makes me happy (i tried for pink but no luck) however there are downers to my psyched-ness. like i just found out that school starts on august fifth. while im kinda looking forward to it just so i can get out of this house, i really don't want to go with my mask all perfectly in place and pretend like i dont care that i have no friends at school (or within a 3000 mile radius). plus i'm broke and i thought i'd have a wee bit more time to buy school clothes. so now i have to go bribe my dad into giving me large advances on money i might be getting sometime. its not actually that hard though, so im probably going to look great next year. but i still dont want to go. &nbsp; for all of you who dont care to read my long tirades, this is my life: i'm: psyched about: my guitar everyone getting their presents getting away from this abysmal hole down about: school starting having to do housework mississippi in general being alone &nbsp; anyhoo, i think that covers it. hugs L

      well life is the same old, same old. except... my sisters leaving for Idaho tomorrow and i'm insanely jealous my mom got a job and so now she expects me to do everything for her, including cook dinner and, as all of you know, i'm no emiril lagassi (hey i'd settle for chef boyardee, but i dont even rank there) oh and we're heading to some big benifit thingy for some aquarium. coincidentally, my family decided not to tell me about it until now because apparently it ammuses them to see me unprepared. but thus is life. anyway just an update on life in my very wet hell. (ya know i always thought hell would be really dry and flame-y, but i suppose everyone is wrong sometimes)

      well, i'm actually happy today, which is kinda off from the usual monotony of emotions ranging from boredom to depression. but i guess i've finally started to accept the fact that i have to move on. its just so hard to realise that its been five months. i really want to be back where i belong, but i guess i finally realised that thats not possible. its funny though that im so calm about the fact because normally i freak when i cant control everything that happens. but i sorta guess i've accepted that i have to give this one up, let God handle it. i've kinda had a breakthru about all that, i realised that i dont let God have everything in my life, there's chunks which i just say are off limits. so thats my new spot to work on, and i hope you'll all pray for me to have guidence through all this. i love you God bless L
