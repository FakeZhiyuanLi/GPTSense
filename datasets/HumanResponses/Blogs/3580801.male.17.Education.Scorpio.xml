      Well it had to happen sometime.  Today was just one of those days where the voices inside just decided to turn on me and start ripping me to shreds.  In other words, I entered a valley on the bi-polar rollercoaster.  My mom started getting on my case again about what college I should go to and I just couldn't stand it.  She's really protective, so naturally, she wants me to attend a school that is relatively near-by.  Because of this, my mother is dead-set on my attending Rutgers State University.  She doesn't care what I go there for, only that I go there.  She incessantly says how I'll be able to go there for free since my grades are so high, but in reality, Rutgers will only pay a maximum amount of $4,000 toward the tuition of $14,000.  Wonderful, a school I'm not really looking forward to will still put me in debt.  I'd rather go somewhere that may a chance of fun and new beginnings rather than the dump for everyone in Jersey.  My grades and participation in extra-curricular activities can get me into better schools, but my mom won't have it.  She says they won't pay my way to go to them, she doesn't realize that Rutgers won't either.  She merely wants me to stay near her.  Maybe I'll just buy her a cat and say good-bye.

      My school hosts a mixed doubles tournament for the people that play on the girl's and boy's tennis teams.  I've entered all four years but have only managed to get into the semi-finals every year.  This year was different however.  My teammate, L, and I whooped up on the competition today.  We destroyed the best team, but more importantly it was a team effort.  L is badass with strokes that are definitely more consistent than mine.  I couldn't have had a better partner.  That's about it for today.

      I'm bi-polar.  In my high school psychology class the disorder is defined as "crippling."  Can't say I agree with them, but it's a shit textbook anyway, so who knows what other sources say.  It's not crippling to me, I've made it to junior year without any real problems.  Hell, my school doesn't even that I am afflicted by it.  Whatever, they'd probably shit their pants if they knew their goldenboy was fucked up in the head.  That's right, someone with a "crippling" psychological disorder has managed to become the standard by which others are judged.  It's just funny how people will latch on to whatever they deem as normal and good, but won't bother to question it.  But, I'm not hear to preach about the evils of religion or government, afterall, this is a Blog for Chirst's sake, so rather than insightful social commentary, you're in for more high school melodrama bullshit than you can handle.  Enjoy, and if you're lucky, something worth reading might just slip in.

      I was bored one day and didn't feel like reading, so I broke down and thought people might care.
