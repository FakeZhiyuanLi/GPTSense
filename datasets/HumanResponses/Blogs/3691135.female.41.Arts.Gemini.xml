      Up at sparrow's fart this morning.  Cooked the Saturday morning breakfast for the divine ones but couldn't face eating anything myself.  Last night it felt like I had fallen asleep, turned over once and the alarm was going off.  No dreams, no disturbances, just lovely peaceful sleep. What seemed to be about five minutes worth. I didn't even hear The Girl come into my bed.  Sunny but chilly this morning. The soccer game was a good one to watch.  These little people are becoming quite skilful.  The other team had some really aggressive little monsters on their team - quite a bit of pushing and shoving going on.  It saddens me when you see that because you just know that they aren't really having fun because they are too focused on winning.  Anywho, The Boy played really well.  Afterwards we went down the road to see my friend Sarah - her boys were playing soccer and football at the same time at the same sporting grounds.  She is an even more devout sporting mother than me...She was organising the bbq.  It was good to catch up.  I feel quite chirpy at the moment.  The blues of the  last month or so are lifting. The father of the children didn't show at soccer again but I don't think either of the children were too fussed about it.   So now we have come home and they are out the back burning up the energy (where do they get it all from?) bouncing on the trampoline.  I think that trampoline was the best investment I have made.  It keeps them active, under control and the cat really enjoys it as well.  So far no falls, no broken bones, no injuries.  Touch wood.  The mats around it are a good protective measure and if they fall it's onto grass.   The Boy is asking me to take him to the skate park today.  I have a shitload of housework I need to do.  The Girl gets bored at the skate park.  How do I split myself three ways???? Into mean mummy mode.  The Boy can skate up and down the footpath, the Girl can amuse herself singing karaoke (yes, another investment but somewhat questionable) and I am going to at least make a start on the housework. I am the only person who does anything around here.  Bloody hell, I DO EVERYTHING!! I haven't even given a thought to what I will do with myself tonight (that is if the father of these children gets it into his head that he will spend some time with them).  C was suggesting that we have a date but hasn't called as yet.  Probably he has tried to, but I am on here a lot...reading blogs and writing this....all the details of my fabulously exciting life.... As for A, well we all know that I am NOT going to have anything more to do with him.  No siree.  Pffft..... I can't think of anything else to write about. I braided my hair yesterday so that it would be all curly.  It was.  Then it got rained on.  And went frizzy.   That's where the hair is at. Yes it is.

      is mandarines.  When I was pregnant with the divine ones I couldn't get enough of them.  I love the smell.  I love the taste.  I've got three of the little suckers here right now.  I'm comforting myself with fruit.  Ha Ha, Inner Fat Lady.  FOILED AGAIN.  Mandarines aren't fattening..right???

      that my new obsession is with putting links in the posts.  And not photos of me in various states of hideousness.  The divine ones are chatting to each other from their beds.  I want them to shut up.  I have to get up real early tomorrow so they can have a cooked breakfast before we go to soccer.  And my son thinks I'm mean.  A just sms'd me He's "out and his phone is on silent". Get over yourself A! Well, that's just FINE.  Tomorrow night I will be out and my phone will be OFF.  In fact my phone will be off to him from now on.    Don't mess with me.  I bite.  I think I have cabin fever.  I want to get out and do things.  I love my children and I want to have a bit more life outside of being a mother.  A only sees one of his daughters for seven hours a fortnight.  He's got no idea what it is to be a hands on, there for your kids parent.  He comes here last night, sleeps with me, and then the next night he can't be disturbed.  He's probably up to his old tricks.  He seems to enjoy being a player but can't deal with being played.  Whenever I do go out or I don't call him for a few days he calls and wants to know what is up with that.  IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER.  When am I going to get that through my head????  Oh shit.  Why am I doing this to myself???  If he is out screwing around then good luck to him.  He still has to go home to Mummy and Daddy's house.  And he thinks he's got it together.  Pffft.  Last night I really enjoyed being with him.  This morning I felt quite tender towards him.  Now tonight I'd like to walk past him, and be unaware of him because I'd be smiling into someone else's eyes and seeing love there.  I'm a hopeless case.  But there's always tomorrow...

      I posted this earlier, at least I thought I did, but it disappeared. A is not answering my calls to his cell phone. No big deal.  I just wanted to ask him something.  He's out somewhere and I don't rate.  Bad manners is what that is. It's just rude.  He call me whenever he gets the urge.  I call him and he ignores my calls.  Ok.  I am not going to call him. EVER AGAIN.  And tomorrow night I am going on a date with someone else.  I see a margarita in my future. (The drink, not the signora.  I'm with  urlLink Momster  on that one...the only woman I would consider is Angelina Jolie and even then I'd have needed a few margaritas first)  Oh I can't wait to get my hands on the soccer player next week..

      I have been reading  urlLink Scarlett's    blog.  Funny, witty, full of that southern charm.  Here in Australia I would be considered a Southerner sometimes referred to here by northerners as Mexican.  This obsession I have with creating links has got to be easier on the eye than my earlier obsession with posting photos of me, and then....me...and of course , not to be forgotten...me.  A is not answering his cell phone.  I take back anything nice I may have thought/said about him.  He calls me whenever, wherever.  I call him and he is ignoring my calls.  So that should tell me something.  It tells me that I am not going to call him again this weekend and tomorrow night I am going out with someone else and I am going to have loads of fun.  I can see a margarita in my future (the drink, not the signora) (I'm with  urlLink Momster  on that one...the only woman who does it for me is Angelina Jolie) and A be damned...  Gotta go and hang out the washing now so that I can wear my favourite top to soccer tomorrow.  And I need to sleep so that I don't have to lug this luggage around under my eyes tomorrow.  I sweat today I looked 51 instead of 31.

      This blog is anonymous, right?  Of course it is.  So it is perfectly ok for me to say what I am about to say.  I have a new massage client.  He is a Latino soccer player who is HOT.  He has the most beautiful eyes and is tall and is put together in a very attractive way.  Oh lordy, how am I going to do this?  I got all sweaty and tongue tied and kept melting everytime he smiled at me. Which he did.  A lot.  Ok ok, I'm forty one.  I have earned my right to be a pervy old person.  Yes I have.  He is HOT.  HOT.  HOT.  I am a professional.  I will massage in a professional manner and keep my thoughts pure and clean.  Like hell I will.  I really hope he can't read minds.    Later on I think I may have to deal with myself while thinking about him.  I am a pervert.  Yes I am.

      still not sure it I am getting the link thing right.  So if I was to type in  urlLink Southernly Delicious and then follow the instructions from Blogger it should work. And it has!!! Oh I wanna do that again.  Let me see.  Another place I have been which is a good read is  urlLink Genuine  Oh I'm on a roll here!  I love it when I work stuff out. I even managed to serve up dinner tonight without stuffing anything up! How hard is it though to put the meat and the vegetables into the oven to roast for an hour and a half though? I am pleased to report that my head is clearer now (last night I had a leetle more wine that I should have.  I love red wine but it don't love me so much).  I am looking forward to an early night tonight.   The divine ones came home and they are DIVINE.  They are watching the Simpsons so I am guaranteed half an hour's peace.  As I am now officially a 'soccer mom' we have to be at the playing field tomorrow at 8.30am.  It has been raining here in bucketloads again (all night, in the morning and without fail at 4.00pm).  It was all the bragging I was doing about yesterday's sunshine.  Which was wonderful. I even got a little colour from it. So tomorrow is soccer which means tonight I have to be super organised.  I have a favourite new top at the moment which I planned to wear again tomorrow only the Inner Fat Lady spilt something on it at dinner.  Dammit Inner Fat Lady - get outta my house!! TV here is crap at night.  We don't have Foxtel, just the commercial stations.  I bought a dvd player but haven't taken it out of the box yet.  I also bought a new printer and it is still in the box as well.  I am lazy.  Yes I am.

      A came over last night.  I am a hopeless case.  Completely hopeless.  And I left my blog on the screen of the laptop.  Now A is not a snooper.  But he did notice.  So this morning I went in and edited(deleted) some of my earlier posts.  Just in case.  And I have decided not to censor myself.  Chances are he has forgotten all about this blog and won't find his way to it.  But just in case he does, I would like him to know that I am not saying anything in here that I don't say to him.  We drank some nice red wine and sat around the table and talked for hours.  It was good.  It has been a while since I have felt that connected to him.  But we are still over.  So over.  As over as you can be when you are sleeping together once, twice, sometimes three times a week.  He stayed here last night and it was lovely to wake up to him this morning. Normally he leaves before the morning (if my children are here I prefer that). He is so warm and so gorgeous.  And I am not posting this here because I think he might be reading it.   I am a hopeless case.

      So the divine ones went to their father's for the night last night. The Boy has his clarinet lesson today at school so I sent him with his clarinet.  So anyways...the school just rang me requesting that I take the clarinet to school as the Boy doesn't have it with him...uh huh, okaaaaaaaaay.....turns out that the clarinet is still with the father (notice I haven't called him a dickhead once??!!!)  The father tells me he didn't know that the clarinet lesson was today. Despite the fact that he was the one who told me that the teacher had told HIM that it had been changed to Friday.  I don't know what he's smoking these days...Dickhead!!

      The girl skipped across the back lawn earlier this evening and clambered up onto the trampoline.  (It's a bit of a ritual, the divine ones come home from school and the first thing they do is go and have a bounce).  Here's the thing.  Our cat, a black and white fool who goes by the name of Tom (only he's neutered), hops up there with her and has a lovely bounce as well.  Yep, nothing unusual there.  Just my girl and the cat ..bounce bounce bounce.  It cracks me up...he is the most uncat like cat we have ever had.  He comes when you call, bounces on the trampoline, hops into the front seat of the car whenever we go anywhere and sits there expecting to come too. When the children went to the kindergarten just across the road from where we lived he would go as well and spend the morning with the children. Hell, you throw a ball and the cat will chase it.  He just won't bring it back.  I will take a photo of this next time it happens.

      I just made apple and banana filled pastries.  For the children.  (Did you hear that Inner Fat Lady?  I said FOR THE CHILDREN).  The Inner Fat Lady is the one who lives inside me who eats too much. The one who gets out of bed at night and goes to the refrigerator, Who has sometimes been known to eat..straight from the refrigerator.  She’s gross.  Sometimes straight from the cupboard.  The Inner Fat Lady is also the one who believes that eating burgers and fries from Hungry Jack’s (that’s Burger King here in Oz) won’t be as fattening because the children are with their father that night.   As I sit here typing I can feel that tyre around my middle pushing into my elbows.  It wasn’t there this time last year.  The Inner Fat Lady has given me that.  Thanks for nothing Inner Fat Lady!!

      today is a beautiful day weatherwise...it's winter and the sun is shining and everything is green and the sky is the most blue of blues...tra la la la....and I slept last night!  I don't recall having bad dreams and I did not wake up with the heebie jeebies at any time and having that one night of relative peace has made all the difference.  I don't feel old, sad and ugly today. I only went back onto the Lovan yesterday (a dark place for me was yesterday) so it must all be in my head!!  As I said I slept and woke this morning and I feel lighter and better.  I don't dare step on the scales because, well, me and exercise haven't been getting along that well lately...but if sadness can be measured in kilograms I  have definitely lost some!! (Of course, tomorrow I may be back where I started, that is the nature of this condition, but for now I am grateful, so grateful just to have a break from the dull, grey sadness and pain.)  I wonder if I will have the nerve to tell Mr G (my therapist) on Friday morning that I have caved and have gone back on to meds?  Probably not.  But as I said, once things are sorted here and I am in the new house (wherever/whenever that will be!!?) I will have another crack at "going down into the depression and coming out the other side".  Mr G compares it to going out to the desert for forty days and forty nights, well I felt like I had been out there for 49 and could see no end in sight.  Maybe it was the darkness before the dawn...Oh who cares.  All I know is that today I feel better.  I really wish there was a definite answer on the new place.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to jinx things - living in this house makes me think too much about A and what happened and I need to get away.  And besides that the "rent" is a bit steep for me.  I'd like the pressure to ease up a bit. No word from A.  That's ok.  I can deal with that.  It's probably a good thing.  I have been ignoring my phone and I have been plugged into the internet (dinosaur dial up connection) so the house phone has not been ringing.  I'll probably get told later how much this has been pissing someone off but I really don't care.  I want to be left alone for a while to dwell in my own head.  One particular friend keeps bugging me to drive to her house all the time.  I really need to say NO I DON'T WANT TO and have her leave it at that.  Mr G keeps telling me it is ok to do that.  This particular woman, S, is lovely but she needs to recognise boundaries sometimes.  I love her dearly but I am not like her.  I don't need constant phone contact.  Every time she has a conflict of any sort (and that is pretty often) she is on the phone to me.  I like to listen a lot of the time and she does the same for me...but she will ring at dinner time, or when I am trying to do homework with my son, and sometimes I feel like saying GO AWAY.  I can be a lousy friend.  Yes I can. My way of dealing with things is to come in here and bitch and whine and cry and take silly pictures with my webcam.  At least that way you , the reader, can read or not, it's your choice.  Actually, I am pretty confident that noone reads this blog.  That is ok with me.  If it was me, I guess I wouldn't read it either.  I read a few blogs, when I have time, and I love the humour in some of them.  I guess it takes a while to develop that style.  At the moment I am so caught up in what is going on in my head that it is not very interesting for anyone to read, let alone funny.  Blah blah blah... I'd like to be able to write about the funny things that happen to me out there but well, I'm not out there at the moment.  I really am staying in and being all agoraphobic like.  I go to the 24 hour supermarket around the corner.  They are used to me wandering aimlessly around in there.  It's where I do my thinking sometimes.  Oh, and my shopping. So anywho....I sent the children off to school this morning.  The boy is going on an excursion to a science centre.  He is so excited.  He loves anything sciencey and mathematical.  With his hair all styled (he is very particular about his hair) he looked so cute I had to take a picture of him.  He was not very impressed with me this morning.  I suspect he thinks that I suck sometimes.  He has told me this, once.  Only once.  My girl was just divine.  She is always divine, even when she is being a stubborn little donkey.  She had some pretty chunky blonde streaks put into her hair a while back and they are growing out.  It looks kinda funny and I can't wait until they are gone.  But I think she looks like an angel.  She is an angel.  Did I mention that I love my children? I wish they would eat more vegetables.  I made pumpkin soup last night, FROM SCRATCH PEOPLE!! It tasted good.  The children wouldn't touch it.  Instead, they ate the pizza that I made.  Maybe I should put pumpkin on the pizza next time. Oh and wonder of wonders, tomorrow night they are going to spend the night with their Dad.  A few months ago I had to insist that they spend the week nights with me, he wasn't so good at getting them to school on time clean and fed and organised...They used to be with him Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  I used to go out a fair bit...my how times have changed...but anyways, he took the girl to Joeys (scouts) last night and as he was dropping her off the boy went to the front door and told him that they (the children) would be staying with him Thursday night.   So he is picking them up from school tomorrow.  Yay for me!!  Friday is the last day of the week so it won't disrupt their week too much and who knows, I may venture out and catch up with C.  Not A.  No siree....(grimaces at the thought of own weakness when it comes to A). I wonder if it matters if I use names in here?  I mean, nobody but NOBODY I know knows about this blog and what are the chances they would come across it?  As far as I know I am the only person I know who is even aware of blogs on the internet..A couple of times I have slipped up and typed the children's names in and had to go back and change them.  I think I will leave things as they are.   I'm going to post some pictures now.  Because I can.

      I want to cut it. But it's so long now.  It's taken three years to get it to this length. (I started to grow it when I took up with A) Hey, Sammy's hair (yes, Days of Our Lives is on...not that I am watching it) is looking good.  I might just drag my sorry ass outta here and brush my hair and style it like that. I need a life. But I'll give it a go.  Then maybe I'll go buy some new uggs.  The ones I am wearing were men's...they are way too big and sloppy now. And my boy wants a pair two.  My girl already has new ones.  They are knee length and lace up.  She looks adorable in them. I can't go anywhere with my hair looking like this though. I'll take a photo of before and after and post it, m'kay?

      I'm on my bed with my laptop.  Dr Phil is on counselling a woman who is a sex addict. (She's weird looking...why am I worrying that no one will ever want me again??)  Anyway, I'm overeating.  And no one is going to stop me.  That's just how it is today.  I am going to call A in a little while and ask him over later tonight.  It's three years today.  I want something out of this.  I have stopped crying.  I went back on the medication today.  It'll take a couple of weeks to kick in.  So keep watching this blog...it becomes a three ring circus!!

      I've given in.  I've gone back on to the anti depressants.  In a couple of months when I have moved and sorted things out a little better I will try again.  But right now I can't do it unaided anymore.  The last post I made convinced me of that.  I feel really unlovable like this.  waah waah waah...I feel like slapping myself and giving myself a bloody good talking to.  I am going to go back to dancing.  I learnt belly dancing for a couple of years.  I seemed to let it go this year (living with A I seemed to let a lot of things go).  But for right now I am going to stay here on my bed for a little while.    That's ok.....right???

      this paragraph is taken from an email I just received from C.  I have had two mini dates (coffees and chats) with C and I get that he is interested.   "...but why are you feeling shakey ? have you got inner demons that need to come out, or is it that you feel  like you're struggling with something and not getting much help from anyone ? I can be very sympathetic, you know. I've been through tough times myself where I've agonised about my life, my  circumstances, my relationships and other things."   C and I email each other every day and we just chat.  As soon as I read the above I just burst into tears and am still sobbing.  You see, the last thing I want to do is talk to him about what a pathetic loser I feel like sometimes.  I mentioned that I was feeling a bit unsure, "shakey" is how I describe it and then he comes and hits the nail on the head.  So accurately that I have broken down and sobbed like a baby.  I so don't want to do that around him or anyone.  But IT'S TRUE.  I am full of demons - so much stuff has happened that I just want to forget.  I don't want to dwell in it and drag it up from the past.  I want to live in the now.  And yes, I am struggling BIG TIME and nobody can help, no matter how much they want to.  I don't want anyone to feel that they could, or even should, step in and fix it.  I'm scared of him now.  I'm scared to go near anyone.  I feel so hurt by A, so hurt my the father of the children and I'm so tired. I want to die.  But I know I can't and won't.  I am not suicidal, am not contemplating doing myself in, but shit, I am SO FUCKING TIRED of this heavy lump of pain that I have to drag around every day. I feel tempted to email him back saying STOP.  DON'T BE NICE TO ME.  DON'T SHOW ME ANY SYPMATHY.  I CAN'T BEAR IT!!!! oh yuck.

      Today is the anniversary.  Three years ago I went to a dinner party and reacquainted myself with A. (We had dated about sixteen years earlier).  Ever since then we have been involved...I have loved him, despaired because of him, laughed with him, cried with him, missed him, waited for him, been totally comfortable with him and been very wary of him.  We tried living together and it didn't work.  I have also "done something" with someone else when we were together.  I started to tell him about it because I wanted to be clear and honest but he cut me off.  As though he didn't want to hear it because then it would force him to change his 'picture'.  Since then I have come to understand that he doesn't really see things clearly.  He puts his own slant on everything, no matter how far from reality it may be.  Oh well, all that aside, I still have feelings for him.  Very strong feelings.  I will move on, I know that.  Right now there is one guy who seems interested.  He is nice but a bit older than I normally like.  And there is another one who I am waiting for to email me again.  He seems more my speed.  But then again, I have been known to get it WRONG. Can I be really honest here?  I don't want a partner.  I just want someone who will come and spend time with me when my children are with their father.  I want to feel warm soft skin against mine.  I love sex.  Not any sex, but good sex.  Honest sex.  Not one night stand sex, but just someone who wants to play, wants to talk, will care and be fair, play nice and be real.  But not be here all the time.  Not expect me to be available all the time.  Not want to do EVERYTHING together. I don't want hairy backs.  I don't want to hear whingeing about ex girlfriends.  I don't want someone who smokes pot.  I don't want someone who has to get drunk to be intimate.  I don't want some old sad sack telling me all about his failed relationships. I like to look at good teeth.  No brown, crooked, stained teeth.  Teeth are so important!  Also, no beards. Yes.  That is what I am thinking.

      sorry dear reader for that previous post.  It was not meant for you.  Really, I am calm now and will meditate.  tee hee...NOT.  I love my life. I love my boy and girl. I don't tolerate selfish dickheads well is all.... So now I am thinking about the colour scheme for my new house.  I think I will stay with rose and cream in my boudoir.  I want to do the dining room in caramels, tans, earthy autumn colours....la da de da.... *giggles* he really IS  a dickhead.  I wish I could post a photo of what a dickhead he really is. Did I mention that I had great sex on Saturday night?  Yep, I slept with my ex.  NOT the dickhead father of children.  The bad ex who moved us into this house and then moved back to his parents house.  That's a whole nuther story which I think I may have already told somewhere on this blog.  Naughty naughty me.  Well, he's got that gorgeous dick and he is so comfortable and familiar and knows just what I like. I can't imagine how I am going to find another one and go through the whole teaching thing again.... but I know I will. I don't want anymore dickheads, fucktards, control freaks, damaged egos, .....I just want lovely lovely happy sex. Yes I do.

      you rang today.  all warm and concerned.  are the children ok?  No you fucking dickhead, I've tied them up outside and am hoping that wild animals will come and eat them.  you are such a dickhead.  and whilst I am being generous of spirit and not ripping you a new asshole for lying and dumping shit on me this weekend does not mean that I am going to lay down and let you walk all over us.  You are a spineless weak person.  You lie and think that you get away with it.  well you don't.  I have no respect for you.  I will not tear you down in my children's eyes, because I have respect for them.  I love them and don't want to place the burden of our conflicts on their little shoulders.  Pity you don't see it the same way.  You lack integrity and honesty and you do not take your responsibilities seriously.  You are a professional child support avoider and are so concerned with how other people see you.  What about this?  Your son recognised that you were telling shitty lies on the weekend and that you were being really disrespectful to all of us.  Well, you can deal with that.  You dickhead.  I am laying it all down here because I know you will never see it, and neither will the children.  You keep clinging to the insecure relationship you have with that poor woman who is so obviously desperate to have a relationship.  As far as I can see, she is harbouring and supporting a man who does not do the right thing by his children.  And has failed other children in the past.  Remember your eldest son and daughter?  Where are they now?  Who are they now?  Do you have any idea?  You tried to blame me for everything going wrong in your life...well guess what bud...I don't want to know.  I don't go to your house..you come here and hang...I don't involve myself in what you do.  You get six nights a week, in fact seven nights a week recently, to run your show and I haven't been anywhere near you.  So how can you say that I am the catalyst for the problems in your relationship?  Seems to me that you and your partner are learning that maybe racing into living together (two months in) may not necessarily work as well as you'd like it to.  Ya know what?  You have to work at relationships.  You have to nurture them and allow them to develop and grow.  You work at nothing.  You expect instant gratification.  YOu were like that years ago and you don't seem to have learnt or grown.  If I could, I'd like to say sorry to my children.  Sorry for giving them a father who is weak and incapable of stepping up to his responsibilities.   Get over yourself dickhead.

      I just realised today, after paying hundreds of dollars of bills that the power company have not sent a bill here since we moved in.  What the...?  Have they forgotten about us?  Is there a glitch in their system?  What should I do?  I guess I don't need to do anything.  I can just sit and wait and see what happens.  Power is so expensive here and well, I want to have heat occasionally.  And I am a very conservative person.  I make sure I turn off appliances when we do not need them to be on.  I am always walking around the house turning the lights off in empty rooms.  I don't run the heat as much as other people I know.  We lived in a house for six years that had no heating.  We learnt to wear warmer clothes and to snuggle under rugs and things.  Also, bed is a great place on cold winter nights.  Is the great spirit cutting me a break and letting me off paying for power?  I dun think so....still right now I am happy to say "let it sit.  If they catch up with me they can bill me and I'll pay it later".  It's not my job to ring them and ask them are they doing theirs...right???  Money's too tight to mention.  I need new prescription glasses.  I have been wearing the magnifying ones for the last couple of years and I think I deserve to be able to see clearly when I need to.  I am saving money and the children always come first.  I can go without new clothes, I don't wear makeup anymore (A convinced my that I look better without it.  I have to say that my skin has been much cleaner and clearer looking as a result.  However, I still love my shiny lip gloss.  I have nice shaped lips.  If I am starting to look like a woman in her early forties then that is fine with me because that is what I am.) I don't spend money on booze or cigarettes.  I don't spend money on anything other than surviving and giving the children the best that I can.  I want my son to have music lessons because he enjoys learning the clarinet.  I want my daughter to have dance lessons because she loves that.  I want them to be able to do the things they want to do. Life is good.  Even if we don't have as much as others seem to, life is still really good.  We are happy.  We eat well and healthily.   Desert tonight was fresh fruit.  The children don't see anything wrong with this at all.   Of course, they love ice cream and chocolate and all that other indulgent stuff, but they accept that most of the time we eat fresh fruit for desert.  They are happy and healthy. So, if the power company don't send me a bill, that's their problem. I signed up for the bill when we took posession of this place so I've done my bit. Freedom is Power.  Power is Free?  I'll wait and see.  And meanwhile I'll continue to be conservative and not wasteful with energy.

      woo, feeling very relaxed now (that valium is kicking in).  The curse is upon me..no wonder I have been feeling like a big bloated fat person....the bleeding goes on longer and longer these days...no wonder I feel tired and drained.  Yet another thing to add to the list of things I need to tend to.  Like the washing.  I like to send my children to school in clean clothes every day.  Their school uniforms are looking a bit worn.  I need to go tomorrow morning to buy some new polo shirts for them.  That means I need to be organised.  As in, have the correct money with me in the morning.  That will mean an early morning run to the ATM which will mean leaving ten minutes earlier.  No worries.  I can do that.  I wonder if anyone can be bothered reading this.  It is just me, typing down every little thing that comes into my head. I so want this new living situation to eventuate.

      It's 9.14pm and Boy and Girl have just settled down for then night.  It's a later one because Boy has Cub Scouts.  Tonight was Sumo Wrestling Suits Night.  I think Boy looked more like his mother than ever... I went to see A at his work today.  He was nice, it was ok.  Until he started talking about "not being a victim to his emotions anymore".  Just sounded like double speak for not dealing with his feelings.  Or even allowing himself to accept that he has them.  Oh well... I found out a bit of interesting information with regards to an old friend who I have sort of lost contact with.  I lost contact with him because he enmeshed himself in a relationship with a woman who makes a career out of being a serial monogamist.  She is not a bad person but she is very territorial and I felt I would leave them to it.  Also, with everything that has been going down with me in the last few months I didn't feel ready to talk to him about it.  Anyways, I heard that they have broken up.  So, maybe now would be an ok time to approach him and catch up over a cup of coffee and just talk like we used to.  He is such a nice man.  I think I need a friend.  Or that I need my friends.  Is this the lightening of spirit that I have been praying for? No news yet on the property that I want to move into.  A told me that he and his family are NOT making a competitive offer on it.  Pffft...as if they would.  The real estate man referred to A as a time waster.  I now know that he was just (trying to) manipulating.  He spoke today about how he hasn't had any contact with his eldest daugher.  Poor kid.  Her birthday is next week and I bet she is feeling really conflicted.  While A and I were living together she would come and live with us four days a fortnight.  She had some problems dealing with the sudden changes, she has had to deal with so many disruptions and quite traumatic experiences over the last couple of years.  Both her mother and father are very extreme people (in fact her mother is the serial monogamist I referred to earlier).  I love this blog because it is anonymous.  If anyone I speak of stumbles across it I hope they understand that I am writing this here to facilitate my journey through this life experience...not to be judgemental of anyone or the choices they make.  One thing I am learning is that there needs to be grace in life.  I speak about things as I see them and I really mean no harm to anyone.  I try not to judge because one thing this life is teaching me is that we are all human, spiritual beings having a human existence.  Our spirits, our souls, our bodies are all the one thing.  I am learning how all the different elements of who we are must be combined harmoniously - I can't live in my head and not my heart and I can't live in my spirit and not my body. Since coming off the anti depressant medication I have started to have very physical reactions to events and people.  A while ago, any interaction I had with A literally made me throw up.  It was then I came to understand that the way things were between us and the way I was allowing him to treat me was really making me sick.  Now when I see him I don't feel nauseated.  Today I was able to say honestly that all I wanted was just a hug.  I needed some human contact and I needed to know that someone at least cared, even if it was only a little bit.  I didn't end up walking..I got scared of it... My sister F has been talking to me.  I love her so much and feel that I have been unable to communicate to her just how important she is to me.  Not because of the things she has shown she is prepared to do for me.  But because of everyone in the family she is the one I can talk to about how things are going.  We have spoken about setting up a business together, working with lead lighting.  She is very artistic and creative and has a wonderful flair for choosing colours and creating amazing interior schemes.  I am creative too.  I am an attention to detail freak.  So tonight I have organised to learn to go and do pottery. Yes.  I have become a forty one year old woman who wants to go and do a pottery class.  That's funny.  It makes me laugh.  But I can just see our lovely shop - sunlight streaming in through the windows and reflecting off the beautiful glass designs, all the colours and us sitting together but separate working on our respective pieces.  I can see shelves displaying my ceramic glazed pottery pieces.  Not flowery vases but cups, plates, stuff you can use.  Not stuff that sits collecting dust.  I want to work on some urns, exploring the female form. And strong colours.  no pastels. I am also still in the looking for work mode. I want to shed this weight I have been carrying around.  Maybe the weight is the physical embodiment of my fear and sadness? I took a valium earlier, just to take the edge of the hype that has been building up in me. I made a very homey dinner for my family tonight, we sat and ate together at the dining table.  The Simpsons were on in the next room which grated on me. Hey, I say that I am not taking medication, the occasional valium just helps to take it all down a notch or two. I am not a purist.

      dropped Boy and Girl off at school. Girl forgot her school bag.  Too busy fighting with Boy about who gets to sit in the front seat.  Nobody gets to sit in the front seat.  Just me, because I am driving.  Then I went and bought healthy diet food...steamed salmon and vegetables for me this week, along with all the curries etc I cooked yesterday which now don't appeal to me at all, of course. I also went and bought some new exercise/leisure type clothes.  I am going to bathe, cos I don't smell good to me right now, and then I am going to walk.  All day.  I will walk past where A is working and stop for a coffee because of course he needs to see how healthy and glowing I will be after all that walking.  Hang on a minute whilst I slap myself.  I want him to...oh shit...I don't know.  I guess I just want him to care.  about ME.  Ok, so he can get a glimpse of sexy glowing me and then I'll disappear for a while so he can start to wonder.  Anyway, sexy me is going to walk and walk and walk until I have my sexy butt back.  I am tall and have an hourglass shape (when the excess flab is not there).  I am making my body my project for the rest of the year.  I am going to get dead sexy again.  And that my friend is why I am going to go now and start walking my way back to sexy. tee hee....normally it would be time for medication now but not today....

      is full of caffeine.  I know this. I love it.  Just around the corner from where I live there is this little cafe run by a really nice man who is VERY particular about how he serves his coffee.  It is so so so so GOOD.  Did you hear me?  I am going to go and get myself one today. It will be my reward for all the good work I am going to do.  Latte (not soy..I dabbled in that for a while but I love the creamy warm lattes)...yum yummy yummmm.  Did I mention that I love the coffee from the cafe round the corner?  I go there with my mother sometimes.  Mostly we go into the markets on Thursday morning and have lattes at Z's cafe.

      I didn't get to my bed last night.  Boy and Girl were staying with their father. I missed them!  It is the first time they have had a night away for two weeks.  No big deal normally, but things have been as far from normal lately as they can get.  So I pulled out the couch bed again.  I have slept on it for the last two nights.  My bedroom is staying very tidy.  And it really isn't all that comfortable.  I think today I will organise some padding on it to make it more so.  I have been waking up at all times in my bed and lying there worrying and feeling anxious.  So, I figure if I sleep in the lounge then that is where I will sleep. So anyways, last night I completely blew my diet by getting a burger/fries and coke meal.  Dreadful!  I will have to walk for an hour and a half today just to deal with the burger.  Never mind. I got online this morning and paid my mortgage, bills and put money in my savings account.  It's not much but it will take the stress factor down a bit.  I hope. I need a job.  Like a real job where I go someplace for a certain amount of hours a week and do other people's stuff.  I have my own massage business here at home but because I have been sick lately and very depressed I haven't really wanted to have contact with people.  I don't want to infect them with my sadness! I am hoping soon that my sister and I will be running a lead lighting workshop together.  That is in the pipelines and I am praying it comes together.  I am not a religious person but I am still praying.  A lot lately. If you the reader are starting to wonder "what is she going on about?" let me just quickly tell you.  I am not crazy, I am just sad sometimes.  At the end of last year I moved myself and my two children out of the house we had lived in for nearly six years and moved in with A.  I loved him then and we had plans to form our own family group and live in a loving home together.  It didn't work out.  A lot of it was down to him turning out to be someone completely different from the A that I knew.  And also it had to do with the fact that I had been living alone with my babies for six years and just didn't know how to adapt to living with someone else again.  A didn't give it time and to be honest I was glad and relieved when he left.  He has a lot of issues.  He is living with his Mum and Dad who are still picking up after him and propping him up.  He has a huge ego and is quite delusional about his life.  Sadly, in all of this he lost contact with his eldest daughter and now only sees his youngest daughter for seven hours a fortnight.  He just doesn't get that he is an angry, scarey, bullying person.  He doesn't see there is anything wrong with him but he scares his children and my children didn't like him yelling at them...so anyways, I'm not into blaming.  It just didn't work out and so he is gone.  Life then got very expensive for me.  My confidence plummeted to an all time low and I have been very stressed and depressed.  During this time I have been seeing a counsellor who has helped me to see that I do not have to medicate myself anymore and that depression is something that my body needs to do.  I am learning to listen to what it is telling me.  It is difficult and frightening at times and there has been a river of tears flowing.  And at this stage I have to say that I can see a glimmer of light up ahead.  The darkness is lifting somewhat.  I had no idea how deep and intense the sadness that I carry within me is!  And I am an outgoing, funny, happy person who laughs a lot.  I have withdrawn a lot and have lost contact with a number of people who I thought were friends.  I don't blame them.  It's ok for this to be happening.  I need to be alone right now.  Going out and dealing with social issues would just distract me from the personal work I need to do.  I used to drink, not excessively, but I used alcohol to medicate myself, along with smoking to get high.  I don't do this now.  I feel a lot clearer.  I still have a glass of wine or two occasionally but nowhere near the amount I used to indulge in. I wonder where my children are?  Their father is supposed to drop them home before school this morning.  Oh well, they will be here soon and it won't stop the world turning if they are a bit late for school.  See, this is how it's going for me.  I am learning to not be so anxious and uptight.  It was unbearable for the children to have a mother who would fly off the handle at NOTHING.  EVERYTHING. So, now I want to get out there and start working.   So I will go into 'looking for work' mode.  I am also supposed to be studying for my diploma in professional counselling but that is sort of on hold for the moment.  Today I will take a step towards getting that back on track as well. Another goal for today is I am going to clean my car (inside anyways, it has done nothing but rain here for the last week). So, there you go.  Every little thing.  And it's 8.15am. Has all the makings of a perfect day.

      I have been watching Sixty Minutes (because I can't bear to watch Big Brother) and there is a segment about a woman who killed her autistic child.  It made me cry.  I think how hard it is to raise two "normal" healthy children virtually on my own (they go to their Dad one night a week - when he is not acting out and abandoning them because his new partner is feeling insecure..again).  It is frustrating at times and very rewarding.  Sometimes I feel as though I am on my own and nobody loves me and then Boy comes and hugs me and tells me he loves me and I realise how lucky I am.  Looking after my two is hard work - just keeping on top of everything that is needed, day in day out.  Sometimes life seems so repetitive and mundane that I could scream...and it is also the most important thing I will ever do in this life.  If anyone tried to hurt my children I would stop at nothing to protect them.  I love them. Totally.  And yet I can see how this woman found herself just losing it and, in the end, losing her son. Was what she did terrible?  Yes.  Should she be in jail?  I think not.  I think living with the knowledge of what she has lost will haunt her forever.  I do not condone what she did but I do not believe that she meant to do it.  I will admit that at times I lose it with my two, I have a temper and life can get me really down and then I get angrier than is warranted and I yell and scream and can be really negative with my children.  I don't like it and I want to change it. I am changing it and I still make mistakes.  This segment just made me sit and cry.  I have been doing a lot of that lately.  I figure that eventually I will have sobbed out all the sorrow I have buried deep inside myself.  Then I will emerge from the tears, cleansed and ready for the rest of my life.  I used to take Prozac to stem the tide of tears.  I became numb.  The grief just sat there and fermented.

      I have had a lazy lazy day.  Boy and Girl have gone with Dad and I am laying around creating this blog. I made red curry chicken adn satay beef - to use up the meat before it was no good.  Now it sits in the fridge and I won't have to worry so much about cooking this week.  Later I am going to make pumpkin soup for my children.  They don't like my curries and asian dishes so much.  Unadventurous little palates that they have. I will miss them tonight but boy do I love having some time alone, for the first time in fifteen days! However, Boy and Girl will be home in the morning before school.  I have to have the uniforms and the lunches ready.  I have to have the bills paid.  The dishes washed.   The toys picked up and put away.  The garbage needs to go out.  I am still in my pyjamas. I am going to go out later and get a bottle of wine and some take away BECAUSE I CAN.  (I could have sex with myself, if I wanted to!!  because I had lovely good sex last night with A. and now all I want is more lovely sex....not necessarily with A.  though...). I had to go and deal with the washing.  In a lazy way.  Still it is all done.  I have decided to pass on the bottle of wine.  I will feel like crap tomorrow, even if I only have one glass.  And really, what is the point of having only one glass?  I love that buzz of getting slightly buzzed.  But not alone. My cell phone has been beeping and ringing and I am not going to pick it up.   And I miss my children.  I went into their room earlier and put some of their stuff away.  I love their smell.  I love them. That's all I got for now.

      dear darling a.  You are the worst I know.  You are the best I know.  I know that I will move on soon.  I know that you will be hurt and grieve as I have had to.  Do like me..let it flow and you will grow through it.  Ii is not my intention to use/abuse you hon, but I gotta tell you that I love having sex with you.  I just don't love you anymore.  Because, sadly, I am not ready to trust that you will not hurt me again as you have done.  One day I may be ready to accept that risk but all I know now is that we are done, except that we are still having wonderful sex.   Because you my dear have the most gorgeous penis.  And I normally don't care much about them.    So, thankyou for the lovely lovely sex we had last night.  I anticipate that I will keep having lovely lovely sex with you until I find someone else that I can play with.  And I am looking.  Because that is who I am.

      is what I have...in immeasurable amounts. Which is why I am letting you, father of my children, get away with the crappy stunts you have been pulling these last few days.  You know why?  Because I love those kids and I will put up with your crap because I know that doing otherwise will not be good for them.  I know you love them so just grow up, get over yourself and look after these kids with me!  This is not about you or me...get over yourself, I did!!  So your new partner is insecure and wants to play games with you..well fiddly dee dee....that is for you two to handle.  Leave the children and I OUT OF IT.   I am giving you the benefit of the doubt here dickhead so make sure you get this right!   I love our children and I know you do too.   End of story.  I will just move past the shit you dumped on us yesterday and assume that you just need to grow up. Pull that stunt again though and I won't be so generous of spirit next time bud....

      Divine Boy's soccer team won this morning's match by a forfeit.  The other team didn't have enough players show up.  So some of the kids on our team played on the other team.  And scored goals.  For them.  It was really good to watch these children out there having so much fun.  The Dad has taken the children.  He told me at soccer this morning that they are all going to a wedding.  This afternoon.  Sheesh, thanks for the notice!  So the Divine Girl immediately decides 'she hasn't got a thing to wear'.  (May I just interject here and explain that she has more in her wardrobe than I have!!)  The Dad (notice I refrain from calling him The Dickhead anymore) received THE LOOK from me.  I hope he is enjoying shopping with her right now.  Seriously, it was like having Cinderella living with us.  I suggested she wore her beautiful medieval dress I bought her last year but Noooooooooooooooo....she doesn't like the sleeves on it anymore.  She suggested wearing her black velvet dress (she calls it her "witch's" dress).  Darling, it's a wedding, not Halloween. Which, by the way, is not traditionally celebrated here in Australia but I do it because I just love any excuse for a party where I can dress up as something wicked.  I should have said yes but it is important to me that my daughter does not attend someone's wedding looking like Morticia Adam's granddaughter.  Meanwhile I am preparing for my date tonight.  My face is green.  I can't smile.  I have a facial mask on.  I was hanging out some washing with this mask on.  The Neighbour With No Hair was also hanging out his washing.  He cracked up.  I didn't.  It would have ruined the face mask.  And now I am preparing to wax my legs.  Now here's the please explain bit.  I ask myself, why am I waxing my legs in preparation for this date when a)I am wearing trousers and b) as previously reported I do not sleep with my dates so he's not going to see, let alone cop a feel of my legs.???  And underwear.  I have chosen my favourite ensemble.  He's not going to see it.  I guess it makes me feel good to know that in the event that I get run over by a bus and he DOES see my underwear he will be impressed.  (Hang on, there's a mental image...me being run over by a bus and my date thinking Oooh nice undies!!..shame about her being crushed to death and all)  I think I've left this face mask on long enough.  This is the longest I have gone without talking.  There's no one here to talk to at the moment but that's never stopped me before.  A has rung me a couple of times this morning.  He doesn't want me to go on this date tonight but he can't come out and say it.  Why am I feeling like I'M THE ONE DOING SOMETHING WRONG HERE???  Anyway, Happy Independence Day everyone!!  Hope y'all are having a good weekend.

      Divine Boy and Girl had last day of term at school today.  Yay!  Two weeks of sleeping in.  We are going away a couple of times and they will spend a bit of the second week with their dad.  Spoke to the dad again this morning.  Communications are improving which takes a load off my mind.  Last night, my friend G (we are going up to his and his wife M's vineyard for a few days) stayed at my place.  He comes down to the city every so often for work related stuff.  I made a Thai meal for dinner and we had a bottle of wine.  Then A came over.  He is pretty down at the moment and I am a sucker.  I still care about him so much.  I wish that we could work things out but I doubt it will happen.  Anyway, we had another bottle of wine.  It was fun.  We sat chatting until the small hours.  I was a bit squiffy and was kinda mean to A.  But he talks over me all the time!  And he was getting loud.  And it pissed me off.  And then this morning (not exactly hungover but pretty close)we woke up and talked.  I can see that he is going through a lot right now and my heart goes out to him.  He is such a beautiful man who thinks he has to prove himself all the time, that he has to impress everyone with his charisma.which he has in bucketloads..when in fact all he needs to do is just be himself and believe that he really is ok.  He was having a hard day today and left work to come and have a hug.  Which of course turned out to be more than a hug.  He went back to work and since then has sent me three sms messages telling me how much he loves me.  Mind you, he also heard me on the phone last night making plans to see J tomorrow night so I think he may be feeling a bit threatened/territorial.  But he made the rules!  I would have loved to still be in a committed relationship with him but he said he wasn't able to commit to that.  And he is out tonight having dinner with friends.  I wasn't invited.  So there you go.... And I have my divine ones here with me tonight.  Tomorrow the soccer game is at nine o'clock so we get a bit of a sleep in.  They were with their dad last night and the girl has been falling asleep since I picked her up at 2.30pm.  When she sleeps she sucks her thumb and looks like a baby still.  They have jumped into my bed.  I am going to toss them out soon because I want to actually be able to sleep in my bed tonight.  I am excited about meeting J for dinner tomorrow night.  We might go to the Thai restaurant that A took me to last Sunday.  I love Thai food.  I really really love Thai food.  J is into Reiki.  I went through the whole new age thing when I lived in Melbourne about fourteen years ago.  But it is interesting to hear him talk about anything he talks about.  And he's warm.  And funny.  Ya know , there are some good things about being a single mother.  I'm allowed to date.  Sure, I'd love to be married to someone who adored me above everything else and wanted to grow old together and have grandchildren and would cut the grass and take the garbage out and love doing it but...well...I'm not in that place.  I married someone once and it didn't work out and ever since then I am afraid of making the same mistake again.  And so I get to date.  Which is heaps of fun.  I'm sensible too.  I don't sleep with my dates.  I don't know how I am ever going to get over A.  Especially as we still sleep together. That's not so sensible.  He remarked this morning "..you are probably going to go and fall in love with someone else...".  I wish I could.  Maybe I will. But can I stop loving him?  Sometimes he makes me so mad I wish I'd never met him.  All I know is that I can't make it happen just because I want it to.  So, in the meantime I get to go out on Saturday nights.  I like lively conversation over good food. And I like that I get to go home alone.  It feels right.  It feels like the dating I should have been doing in my twenties.  In my twenties I was so stupid!!  I was working as a musician (that's how I met the children's father) hanging out till all hours in the nightclubs where I worked, drinking too much and using all sorts of substances that I hope my children never ever ever touch.  I slept with men that I hardly knew and I was not a nice person.  I guess now I can say I am lucky to have gotten out of that life with no diseases and no tattoos.  (Hey, I like tattoos on other people.  I'm squeamish and have no tolerance for pain).    Heh.  Just tossed the kids outta my bed.  Now they are running riot in their rooms.  But the funny thing is, they prefer to sleep in the same room together.  The boy will go sleep in the spare bed in the girl's room.  They are settling down now.  They are such good children. I'm gonna go and tuck them in and tell them how proud I am and how happy I am to be their mother and to promise them that we are going to have a great couple of weeks holiday.  In my thirties I worked for an entertainment agency and also for an architect and an interior designer.  I changed into someone who wore business suits and had her hair and nails done on a regular basis.  I married my musician husband and stopped drinking and doing drugs.  Then the children came along.  I worked right up to the day that I gave birth to my son and went back to work when he was three weeks.  My husband kept working as a musician and cracks started appearing in our marriage.  Then three years later, after the birth of my daughter I realised that he was still living the whole rock and roll existence.  He wasn't there for me or for our children.  I left him and moved back to Adelaide.  It was hard at first, with a newborn and a three year old. I retrained as a massage therapist and while I was studying that I worked as a secretary.  The father followed us back to Adelaide and we started down the rocky road of learning to parent our children together but not together.  It's been a six year journey and at times has worked really well and at other times I have despaired.  One good thing that came out of it all is that my ex husband gave up drinking and doing drugs as well.  The children are loved by both of us and  know it.  Recently, my ex has been having problems in his current relationship and it spilled over onto us.  Of course, this is all covered in numerous posts so I won't relate it all again.  But I am optimistic.  Life gets easier.  It gets harder too.  I hope A is having a nice dinner.  He pre ordered the Peking Duck last night. It is a 'boy's'night out so that is why I am not invited (or so he tells me.  I believe him)  I joked with him today that I was going to ring the restaurant and tell them not to prepare the duck.  I'm evil like that.  Anyways, I don't care much for duck.  I'm going to sleep soon.  I hope you are having a good weekend and Happy 4th of July to all my friends in the US.

      I have just spent what felt like an hour (probably fifteen minutes in all) on the phone with the father of the children.  He is in the remorse phase of whatever luna cycle he is on these days... however I am pleased to report that he has indicated that he is going to act like less of a dickhead and more of a responsible father.  Pinch me someone.   I have told him so many times that I have lost count that I do not want to get in the way of the children having a relationship with him.  I want them to have a good relationship with their Dad. So, baby steps.  He has agreed to go and get some counselling to deal with his outbursts.  I understand that he may have seriously negative thoughts about me (who'da thunk?) and I think he gets it now that I don't want the children made aware of them.  I don't want my son to grow up and create relationships where he is verbally abusive to his partner.  I don't want my daughter to grow up thinking that if someone loves you they will show it by verbally abusing you.  Sheesh, that's what blogs are for!!  I was going to suggest he start up his own.  He could go online everyday and tell the world what an evil person I am. I promise to put a link to that blog if he does it.  Oh hang on....if he can't work a washing machine or a lawnmower OR PAY CHILD SUPPORT??, how is he gonna go with a computer???  It has been so good for me to be able to come in here and bitch and moan about what a dickhead he has been.  And I get to massage the hot hot hot hot HOT soccer player tomorrow.  Woo Hoo....I' a sick puppy.  Yes I am. I truly believe that he is some sort of karmic reward for being such a sainted mother and ex wife.....  And I still have my hair.  It's behaving itself today because I took it outside and sat it down and had a serious talk to it.  I said "Hair, just get it together and start giving me an easier life or I will pull you out strand by strand myself".    So, everyone rest easy...the hair is behaving itself today.  The neighbour who heard me giving my hair the talking too however is disturbed by it all....mind you, he's bald.  He has NO HAIR.

      The soccer player has rung and made another massage appointment.  I am going to have to go to church beforehand and pray very earnestly for help to be very good and not jump him....lol....I did say NOT jump him...  The Divine Boy was in a school play today.  Ah, it's good to see he has inherited all my good looks, charm and talent.  The dickhead was there on the other side of the hall.  At least he bothered to turn up!  There's a positive!!  I woke up this morning and realised I had a bit of spare time.  It's one of those days when I just had to say "It's ok - just let me shop and noone gets hurt".  I bought myself a pair of jeans.  Did you hear that people?  I got my big butt into a pair of jeans!!  Maybe recent crappy stuff does have a payoff...my butt is disappearing.  But shit, why is it that all jeans these days have to be hipsters?  My butt may be doing a shrinking act but the hips have yet to get with the programme.  M'kay...let's talk about me for a while...just for something different.    So I bought the jeans and have all good intention of walking the hips down.  I also bought a really nice red top.  So now I hope that J wants to go somewhere on Saturday night where we don't have to be really dressed up because I want to wear what I bought.

      Yesterday's post was me being at odds with the world.  Not terribly entertaining reading for anyone but gee it makes me feel better to download it all here.  I don't feel like I have to carry it around with me as much.  So, the weather here is, well, it's wet and cold.      "People get ready there's a train a coming don't need no baggage you just get on board"    Two more days left until the end of term.  On Friday the divine ones get out one hour earlier.  Saturday is soccer day.  Saturday night I am going on my first dinner date with J.  We spoke on the phone for ages last night.  We have a lot of things in common.  The same massage tables.  The same CD's.  The same bizarre humour.  On Sunday the divine Boy has a birthday party to go to.  The divine Girl and I are going to clean out the car and start packing.  We are heading off on Monday. A has been very generous and is giving me the keys to his getaway place on the south coast.  I would like to take the children over to Kangaroo Island for a couple of days.  Then we will come back for a day before heading off to the Flinders Ranges in the North.  I will be working, pruning, in my good friends, G and M's vineyard.  Because I love it.  It will be cool but probably sunny.  They have a divine boy and girl too and all the children enjoy catching up.  There will be wine sipping, and I will be cooking for everyone.  Cooking is something I love to do. And I'm good at it.  In fact today I only have a couple of massage clients booked so I am going to bake stuff to take away with us. I think it will be good for just the children and me to get away from here. Change of scenery and we can just have fun.  I am so lucky.  My kids love car trips.    I guess they will be with their Dad on Saturday night.  I wish I could ask them not to tell him where we are going but I can't do that.  It's not fair to them.  I don't want them to feel pressure to keep things secret.  I stocked up on film at the market last night.  I so want to buy a digital camera but for now I'll stick with the old one.  It's still nice to get the film developed and then stick the photos into the album.  I have about ten albums.  When the children were first born I think I took a photo every ten minutes or so.  So.  I'm off to cook, bake, wash my hair and spend an hour or so trying to get a comb/brush through it.  I am still fantasising about cutting it all off and being one of those women who can just get up in the morning, wash it and dry it in under fifteen minutes and go... But I have to lose the weight first.  I'm going to put my yoga dvd on and also put my Anthony Robbins cd in the player and then I'm going to do a happy dance and chant .....because somethings gotta give...right???

      My son's teacher called me in today.  The Boy has been looking tired and stressed and has been complaining of headaches a fair bit lately.  My daughter was also in tears today when I collected her from school.  She says she is lonely and no one will play with her at recess or lunchtime.  Just conincidentally the father was in the car park at the school when I arrived.  He called out to me, rather agressively, but I kept on walking.  The children didn't see him and I didn't mention that I had.  Since then he has been calling my cell phone.  After his nasty crap he pulled in front of the kids on my front doorstep the other day I don't want any contact with him.  And the children spent two days with him and now at school this week there are problems.  And I'm supposed to know what to do.  Only I don't.  All I can do is bring them home, be as positive as I can about what is happening in their lives.  I need to take my son to the doctor to find out why he is suffering these headaches at school so much.  I need to talk to my daughter's teacher.  I want the little bitches in her class who have been teasing my daughter to cut the crap.  Now.  Sheesh, these girls are only six years old and already the nasty, bitchy, clicquey stuff is already starting. As if life isn't going to be hard enough.  Fucking little witches.  I am not one eyed..I am not automatically jumping in and accusing everyone else's child and thinking my own is a perfect angel....but what I have heard I have heard often enough this year and I want it dealt with.  NOW.  Or else I am going to start talking to the parents myself.  Right now I feel like sitting down and having a long cry.  But right now is not the time.  I am going to go and make a nice family dinner.  And later I am going to read the book I went and bought after school.  It's called "Parent Talk - How to talk to your children in language that builds self esteem and encourages responsibility".  I'm worried.  I wish I had someone to work through this with me.  That's where it is right now.

      I came across  urlLink this blog  again after some time.  This woman is fabulous.  I wish I could write like her.  I relate so well to the things she is talking about.  I now wish I had access to this sort of information when I had my babies.  Then maybe I would not have felt so alone and totally incapable of being a mother.

      I was just reading  urlLink Lanie's  blog and it got me thinking.  Up until moving into the house I now live in I always paid a guy to come and mow the grass.  Mostly because that last house we lived in was on a block of land the size of a small country.  The guy who mowed the lawn was cute.  And funny.  And didn't charge a lot.  I liked him.  He went travelling around the world.  I hope he is having a great time. Then we moved to this house.  So that A and I could have a lovely happy ever after family set up here.  (We all know how that panned out and what an idiot I can be...whole nuther story..). This house has a reasonable size back yard with lawn.  The front yard has no lawn.  I have a lawn mower.  Every three or four weeks or so, weather permitting, I mow the lawn myself.  I guess it's exercise.  But I'd rather go for a walk or a bike ride or even , heaven forbid, a work out at the gym.  But noooooo. Because I am trying to save money I mow the lawn myself. I get hot and sweaty, itchy and my shoes get all green looking and my eyes water and go red and I have to wash my hair (another story there too).  Shit. Now here's the thing.  I have a few nice men around me at the moment.  (Ex husband is NOT in that category because he is a nasty assed dickhead).  There is A, who despite not living here anymore (I requested that) still shows me love and care and concern.  There is C who loves to take me out to dinner and send me emails every day telling me how special and all I am.  Then there is J who is a real sweetie and wants to give me shoulder rubs and take me out for dinner and wants to introduce me to all his friends. You know what?  They are all lovely men.  If one of them would come round one sunny day and go "Hey, let me cut the grass for you!"  you know what would happen?  I'd be really, really grateful.  I'd probably confer all manner of sexual favours upon whichever wonderful man did the deed.  I'd get hot and sweaty but not itchy and green and all yucky feeling.  (Still have to wash my hair though....) So I guess it's a good thing that none of those wonderful boys read this blog.  (A, my love, if you are reading this blog STOP RIGHT NOW.  And come over and mow the lawn for me....) I think I need to finally get the divorce papers served on the nasty assed dickhead and REMARRY.  A lovely man who will mow the lawns when they need it.  A lovely man who will be very generously rewarded in the bedroom for doing so.

      Not much. Wait....... No, I can't say that....it would sound like whining and we all know that I don't do that.....much....  So ANYWAYS,  it is cold here!  And it has been raining since last week when I was going on and on about how sunny it was....it rains at the end of school each day.   I was a couple of minutes late yesterday.  The faces on the children.  I am a bad mother.  And this morning I sank even lower on the scale of "How bad a mother can I be???".  I didn't remember to warm the Boy's socks.  Quick, call child welfare.  Last night the children, Boy and Girl, had a combined night at Scouts.  (He's in Cubs, She's in Joeys)  They were really looking forward to seeing the reptile handler who was coming and bringing snakes.  Ugggh.  I didn't hang around, I dropped them at the door and took off.  Well, the snake guy didn't turn up.  Thanks Snake Guy!  One and a half hours later I returned to pick up some very bored children.  And to add to that...I forgot to warm the Boy's socks this morning.  Does it get any worse?

      I have an irritated disc in my lower back.  It is inflamed and is pressing on my spinal cord.  It creates pain and restricts my movements.  I have had to deal with this condition on and off over the last ten years or so.  So I am currently on my bed with the TV on (not watching it) and feeling absolutely bloody woozy and good at the same time (pain medication). Luckily for me it did not flare up until about 3am this morning. I went to turn over in bed and it felt like someone had plunged a knife into my lower back.  Que sera...  but I had a lovely weekend.  I woke up Sunday morning and cleaned up the house.  I have decided not to run away, just yet.  Once the house was cleaned I took a long bath and washed my hair and gave it an intensive conditioning treatment.  It takes hours to brush/comb because it is very thick.  I sometimes want to cut it short.  But while I am still overweight I am not ready to turn into pea head woman.  So the hair has been taken care of.  If I don't get a brush through it every day (and that can take upwards of half an hour) then it starts to dreadlock...can you tell that I have an ocd thing going on with my hair??  Then I made lunch for myself.  Smoked salmon, light cream cheese and capers on rye.  And hot chocolate.  It's made with real curls of chocolate and it is wickedly wicked and I was  making myself feel better.  I was thinking about the children and missing them but I also was relishing the time alone and knowing that I had the whole rest of the afternoon/night ahead of me to do whatever I wanted with.  The washing had all been done and folded and everything was ready for the children to come home in the morning and get ready for school.  Later in the day A rang.  He wanted to come by after he had finished playing golf.  Me, I think he wanted to see how I was after having had a dinner date the night before.  I wonder what he thinks about it all.  Anyway, he arrived and hugged and kissed me and told me that I looked beautiful.  Then he said he was taking me out to dinner.  We went to a little Thai restaurant, not far from home, and had a fantastic meal and a nice bottle of wine.  I knew that he had to pick a friend up from the airport at nine so after dinner I just assumed he was going to take me home and then head off.  We got home to my place and well, we headed for the bedroom.  Now A has always been very skilled and quite gifted in the bedroom department however there was a new playful twist to the proceedings last night.  Very intense and stimulating...not something I want every single time but it felt so so so so so good.  He had to leave afterwards to go pick up someone from the airport.  I got up made a cup of tea and then went back to bed feeling very warm and loved and totally shagged.  Then I checked my email and J had sent me a lovely email....detailing that he wants to take me to dinner just as soon as we can arrange it.  Woo Hoo!!!  So the father of the children can be as nasty as he likes...for every mean and shitful word/deed he commits against me it seems there is a corresponding hug and genuine sharing of love from elsewhere...I am a very lucky woman.  I have my children and I have A as a friend and a lover and I have my friends, old and new.  I may suffer from depression but that is just one part of the story ..it is not the whole story.  As I mentioned earlier, I have had to start taking the medication again.  However, it is just to get me through this time of uncertainty...we need to find a new house to live in and I want to set up my business.  I want to make major changes in our lives and I don't feel I can do this effectively if I am waking up with night horrors every night.  The past few nights I have slept.  It is helping.  When things are settled then I will have another go at it.  Last night, I woke at three am. It wasn't from nightmares or horrors, it was that I had twisted my back somehow and was in a lot of pain. I got myself up and took some pain killers and luckily was able to get back to sleep not long afterwards.  I remember thinking that if I was in a bad way in the morning I would have to keep the children home.  But when they got home this morning they organised themselves for school so well.  They are divine.  I adore them.  The only sad thing was that Girl was a little upset that her father has tried to tell her that she can't have her beanie kids anywhere but at his house because he bought them.  What a dickhead. I asked her "Are they yours?".  She nodded her head.  "Then they are yours, and you can have them wherever you want, ok?".  He's a prick.  What if I said "OK kids, I want you to bring home from your dad's EVERYTHING I have bought for you".  They wouldn't have beds to sleep in.  They'd have nothing.  Maybe a few beanie kids.  Way to go you selfish piece of crap.  He doesn't pay child support.  And he told my son that "your Mum has too many boyfriends".  I really don't, and the men that I sometimes go out for dinner with I only see when I don't have my children.  Dickhead.  He is the one who is on his fourth live in relationship since we split six years ago.  That's gotta tell you something.  Thank the goddess I have this blog to come and pour it all out into.  Otherwise I might do something...like run him over.  Several times.

      If you hang on to the past you die a little everyday.  The children's father stood in my front doorway today and verbally bullied me and tried to intimidate me.  All I am trying to do is raise my children to be healthy, positive, confident people.  It's been six years now since I had to leave him.  He is in another relationship.  He is supposed to be happy.  Why does he have to say nasty passive aggressive things to me, in front of our son? I defused the situation.  I thought about closing the door on him and keeping the children with me.  But then I would have two upset and disappointed children.  They were both looking forward to spending time with their father. Why does he want to tear me down like that, in front of his son?  The Boy stood there with his arms around me and said "no Dad, don't say that to Mum".  I hugged my wonderful boy and said "It's ok honey, you don't need to worry.  You go have a nice time with your Dad".    I don't want him to feel he has to protect me or make choices between me and his father.  I would love to never have to see the ex again but I can't make that choice for the children. When they left I came in and sat in the living room.  I felt numb and cold.  And then the tears started. And after feeling ok the last couple of days I felt like I'd fallen back down the tunnel, into the hole. I thought about packing up and heading off, disappearing for a few days.  Maybe after having to care for his children for more than an overnight visit the father might realise that he needs to ease up on the passive aggressive nasty shit he keeps throwing at me.  But I don't even have that option because just disappearing would upset and frighten the children. But I need a break from this.  I don't want any further contact with the father of the children.  He is just a nasty ass. Then A came around.  He listened.  That's good enough for me.  It helped.  While he was here C rang and we made a date for dinner.  I'm pretty sure A knew that was happening and he was cool with it.  So, not all the men in my life are setting out to hurt me for their own entertainment.  I know that sounds a bit like me being a victim, but I am not.  I just won't put my children in a place they don't deserve to be.  Their father should know better. While on the phone to C he picked up that I was upset.  He asked me if everything was ok and I got that painful lump of tears in my throat and couldn't answer him for a few moments.   He knew.  He picked it straight away.  Oh boy, I am going to have to watch this one!  Anyways, I pulled it together and said "no biggie - see you at seven".   When A left he gave me a big hug and I felt that he wanted me to know that he cares.  Either that or I have gotten it all wrong ...again.  I had only fifteen minutes to get ready so I washed my tears away, moisturised, put eye drops in and a little makeup.  I thought I looked ok, if a little tired.  Well geez louise, I have been up and on the go since 6.30 this morning!! Dinner was at a little Italian place not far from where I live and it was quit nice.  I was only running a little late and C seemed pretty pleased to see me.  We shared a nice meal, a nice bottle of wine and finished up three and a half hours later with coffee and chocolates (which I bought for him as yesterday was his birthday).  I felt a bit tired but relaxed and considerably happier than earlier.  C is growing on me.  He is very interesting and I kept looking at his face tonight and thinking how kind and warm he is.  He is the perfect gentleman.  He walked me to my car and we hugged.  And kissed.  Just one soft kiss, full on the lips, that lasted for about four seconds.  I was surprised how easily I met him for that kiss.  Normally I would expect to feel awkward but it was easy to kiss him.  After the kiss he looked at me intently for a few seconds.  We both took a step back away from each other and that was when it got a bit awkward, for me anyways.  I felt like I should have been on my front doorstep and that my Dad was going to turn on the light and open the door... I said I had really enjoyed the evening, I mean you can't spend three and a half hours talking to someone if you aren't enjoying it... I told him I would be happy to see him again.  So, I played by 'the rules' technically this was our second/third date and a kiss is allowed. He's nice. My ex isn't.  Least not to me. Obviously  me ex has got issues concerning me.  I wonder how his new partner feels about that.  I hope she tells him to shut up and get over it.  I hope she doesn't turn it into a "let's shit all over the ex wife" scenario because I don't think that I could handle my children being around that. No more tears from me.  I am going to sleep and have a nice quiet day tomorrow.

      The Divine Boy and Girl and I are heading north today.  To the vineyard.  I am going to take in that amazing view and breathe freely.  This trip is the best thing... I really need to get away.  I'm feeling emotionally drained and bruised.  I don't feel like blaming, or being blamed.  I just want to change the way I am feeling.  We are so lucky to have the friends that we have.  I'm going to pack the car and get out of here.  Take Care everyone and see you when we get back!!

      A and I.  It's over.  I'm done.  I'm sick in my heart and my stomach.  The cycle has come around again.  The last week had some really nice moments.  And now we're back to that place where I can't be.  Just protecting myself from the onslaught takes more energy than I have.  Sometimes you can love someone with everything you have and it still isn't enough.  No guarantees.  I'll be ok.  I've survived before.

      I have been meandering around again.  I will put links in later to where I have been.  Right now I feel tired.  So tired.  After all the sleep I got last night and this morning.    All the boys have settled down beautifully in the lounge room.  This is what I love about the school holidays.  The children get to do fun things..sleepovers on a Monday night.  When I saw my best friend S this afternoon my heart went out to her.  Here I am constantly whining about my life and my problems....and there she is injured, sick and totally unsupported.  My children's father may not get Father of the Year award from me but hey, at least he is there.  S's ex partner abandoned his two boys.  Twice.   When I get sick I can call on the father of my children and he steps up and helps out.  I am grateful for this. I just forget that sometimes.  I'm not looking for accolades, but it feels good to be able to help out, even if only in this small way.  And they have been such good boys tonight.  I hope S feels better tomorrow.  I met her about four years ago.  She was a friend of a man I was dating at the time.  I no longer see him (just drifted away) but she and I have stayed close.  We have been through some hilarious times.  There have been hot summer nights when we have gotten drunk as monkeys together and danced like idiots until three in the morning. (always at home, safely and NOT in front of the children!!)  We have given up smoking together.  We both walk together.  We both battle our weight.  We tell each other how beautiful and dynamic we really are.  She has told me when I am dating a dickhead and vice versa.  She has been there to put her arms around me when I have sat and sobbed.  So today when I saw how pale and unwell she looked I could not believe that it hadn't occurred to me to make the offer earlier.  I'm a bit slow on the uptake sometimes.  We laugh at each other all the time.  We both have the ability to always see the ridiculous side of any situation.  We care enough about each other to speak the truth.  Sometimes it hurts, but it always feels real.  She is the only person I cannot lie to ...about anything. She can always tell.

      The Divine Ones came home last night.  I had a call from my tiara wearing friend S.  She has had a fall and hurt her ankle and has also been feeling really unwell.  She is on her own and I felt terrible for her.  So I went to her house today, cooked and cleaned and have bought her two boys back here with me for the night.  I hope she uses the opportunity to take a hot bath and go to bed.  And stay there.  We decided not to leave for our holiday until early Wednesday.  I slept in this morning until 9am.  The Divine ones were awake and made themselves breakfast.  I rolled over and thought about thinking about getting up and decided to just stay where it was nice and warm for another five minutes.  Next thing I knew it was 11am and I had gone back to sleep for two hours!!  The Divine Ones were still inside and safe, happily playing together.  I am a bad bad bad mother. I am also a well rested mother who has not said an irritable thing all day.     So now here I am with four children and no idea what to feed them all for dinner.  We cooked a barbeque at S's house at about 3.00pm so I don't think they will be all that hungry for a while yet.  It's weird, it feels like a Sunday but it's Monday.  I love these holidays.  Then again I wonder how much I will love them in a week from now....  Haven't spoken to A or C or J at all today.  I want sometime on my own.  Just to let my head settle down a bit.

      The dinner date went well last night.  The restaurant was great, the food was divine, the conversation was lively, the company was good, I enjoyed myself immensely and felt good.  We left the restaurant around 11 and decided to walk down the road to a bar for a quick nightcap.  That's when it happened.  J is a handholder.  He grabbed for my hand.   Now call me cold and unresponsive..but..I am not a handholder. Not with someone I have only just met. It felt weird.  And a little sweaty.  And I just didn't want to.  I pulled  my hand away.  The only hand holding I do is when I cross my little ones across the street.  Or when I am with someone I really really love.  Like A.    So the hand holding stopped.  To be replaced by an arm around my waist.  This was a first date. No No NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOO.......  We were sitting in the bar for a little while and I just suddenly wanted not to be there.  J was fine.  The handholding and waistholding made me a little uncomfortable and all of a sudden all I could think was I didn't want to be sitting in a bar on a date with a handholder.  I wanted to be with A.  My head started to swim with the knowledge.  I was so caught up in those thoughts that I missed something J had said.  "I'm sorry, what did you say?" I asked him (it was a little loud in the bar).  His response was "I've just been thinking how I've wanted to kiss you for the last couple of hours".  And then the hand went on my leg.  Oh dear.  I had to go.  I thanked him for a lovely evening and then he insisted on walking me back to my car.  Fair enough, it was late and a bit of a walk which I'd rather not have to do alone.  But there it was again....the grab for the hand.  As we walked along I explained to him that I am not a hand holder.  Yes, I can be affectionate but we'd only just met.  I won't even begin to describe the goodnight kiss attempt that I just managed to avoid.  And then to make matters worse, I called him by the wrong name as I was saying goodbye.  I am not sure he heard me.  In the car on the way home my eyes were filling up with tears faster than I could wipe them away.  And it was raining.  again.  As I got in the front door, A rang me on my cell phone.  He just wanted to know that I was safe and home ok.  He wanted to come over but didn't want to ask.  So I did.  He spent the night here and we talked for a while and then I fell asleep in his arms.  Holding his hand.  Hearing his heart beating.  Remembering how just six months ago I believed that we were going to grow old together and that one day I may have to deal with the fact that his heart was going to stop beating.  And hoping that mine would stop beating first.  When we woke up this morning we just lay there holding each other not talking.  We went out to my favourite cafe, just around the corner and sat on the couch there drinking coffee and reading the paper together.  Holding hands.  He left to go and drop his friend off at the airport.  I went home and started cleaning up the house and wishing that the children were coming home earlier than they were.  A arrived back at my house unexpectedly a couple of hours later.  We went and lay on the bed, just holding each other.  And talking.  About why we have ended up where we are.  And how we can't seem to stay away from each other.  And how good we can be.  And how difficult it was when it all went down the way it did three months ago.  I have decided not to make any drastic changes.  But he knows that I love him.  And I know that he loves me.  Maybe we can find our way through all this.  Maybe we can't.  All we both know is that we have to decide.  Not today, not tomorrow, but soon.  The children and I are leaving for our holidays in a couple of days.  I hope this gives me time to think about things.  I wish I could write funny posts.

      When we were in the market today I saw this new Lipton Tea - a flavoured black tea which they have been recently promoting on tv...it comes in flavours like Cookies and Cream, Caramel,&nbsp; Vanilla and Choc Orange.&nbsp; Eden likes to have a "cuppa tea" every now and then so I let her have it ...very weak and with milk and sugar (she is only six after all).&nbsp; So after some discussion we decided to give the Lipton Choc Orange tea a go. &nbsp; We really shouldn't have.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's disgusting.&nbsp; I think that I would rather have a normal cup of tea and then maybe a choc orange flavoured biscuit with it.&nbsp; A cup of tea should taste like a cup of tea.&nbsp; What was I&nbsp; thinking?&nbsp; It is truly horrible tasting tea. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      "bowmboi" by Rokia Traore.   Rokia Traore is a singer/songwriter/guitarist from Mali. In many parts of West Africa, professional&nbsp; musicians are often from a certain lowly caste called the 'griots'. However, Traore's family are from the Bamana ethnic group who do not observe this restriction so strictly. Therefore when Rokia was young she was able to sing with others at wedding celebrations, despite coming from a privileged background. As Rokia's father was a diplomat, her family spent a lot of time in different countries while Rokia was growing up. She came into contact with many local and international styles of music, although her parents were reluctant for her to become a musician. When she was a bit older Rokia stayed at the lycée in Bamako while her parents were in Brussels and there she developed her voice and first performed in public.&nbsp; In 1997 she met Ali Farka Toure who gave her quite a lot of guidance and then in 1998 she recorded her first album, Mouneïssa. The tracks on 2000's Wanita CD are all in Bamanan except 'Château de sable', which is in French. Her lyrics cover issues like respect, traditions and relationships. She is joined by Boubacar Traoré on the track 'Mancipera'.  urlLink Coco Mbassi  does the backing vocals on several tracks and Toumani Diabaté plays kora. Hauntingly beautiful gentle tracks make this a real treasure trove. The hallmark of Rokia's music is trance-like rhythms, in contrast to many of the other women musicians from Mali like Kandia Kouyate.&nbsp;The accompanying instruments Traore chooses are unique as they are traditional like the balafon (giant wooden xylophone) and the tiny n'goni, which are not normally heard together. She also uses kora and calabash percussion.&nbsp; Rokia is becoming well known internationally as she performed with her band at WOMAD Festivals in&nbsp;2001, and also at several venues in USA and London including the Barbican. She has been a finalist for several awards and won the Kora All Africa Music Award for Most Promising Female in 2001. On stage she is truly compelling with her voice, guitar and dancing.Check out Rokia’s own detailed web site which has stunning photos and her very busy concert schedule:  urlLink www.rokiatraore.net At the end of 2003 Rokia's new 10-track album Bowmboi came out. Several of the songs discuss the vital topic of childhood, including the two tracks on which she is joined by the Kronos Quartet. Her style is definitely unique. Also listen out for her distinctive voice on a Senerap band's album: Daara J's Boomerang. Together and separately Rokia and Daara J produce a winning sound for today's world - it can't be sheer coincidence that both Rokia and Daara J won awards in the 2004 BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards.   &nbsp;

      Watched a dvd with the children tonight.  Cooked a homey chicken,vegetable,pasta dish.  Let them camp out on the fold out sofa in the lounge.  They are curled up there together now like little puppies.  It is 2.00am and I am awake.  I have taken some valium earlier, after some pain killers.  I am worried about tomorrow.  I am still bleeding heavily and am in quite a bit of pain.  Something tells me that this is not going to be so good.  Tomorrow's appointment is at 11am.  I looked in the mirror earlier and I look grey.  And my eyes look bruised.  And dull.  And I'm a little over this. I can't sleep.  I have no appetite.  Except for chocolate. How can I be awake when I am so tired?   Am going to try to get some sleep now. Will be back tomorrow with a decision.

      I have some news but I'm not really supposed to say anything just yet but seeing as how noone in my family knows about the existence of this blog...  A few years ago my sister bought a house in a suburb very close to where I live now.  She and her husband renovated the house.  It is spacious, full of light, has a beautiful deck area/entertainment area out the back, an enormous back yard, potential for a fantastic garden (I see water features, play areas, vegetable patches, herb gardens and still space to erect a shed/workshop/studio). They did this so that her parents in law could move from the country to the city. Now the parents in law are ready to move to a retirement village.  The father in law is digging his heels in but he is the main reason they need to move.  The mother in law (she's sort of like an adopted grandma to me) is very eager to move into somewhere smaller and more manageable for them, where they will be near other people in their age group. So this means that the house becomes available for...well, me and my children.  And we will be able to buy it for very good terms. Where we live now is lovely, but since A moved in here with me and then moved out four months later I have never really wanted to stay here.  I want somewhere new that I can start fresh.  The main bedroom has double french doors leading out onto a deck..I can put my desk in there and set up a place where I can write, and sit in the morning sun and have my coffee..I can see my new bedroom..all white and sky blue..And I will be able to put my own leadlighting designs around the front door...there is just so much that can be done...I can't wait to get in there and start painting in my colours!!  The kitchen is all new and it is in a quiet street and is not far from the school. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the parents in law find the place that they are looking for.  It looks like things finally are working out the way they are meant to be.  That's the universe at work for ya..... I also will have a room for massage which means I may be able to let my room at the clinic go and save myself the rent on that each week.  (Given that I have not been well enough to work there recently it has seemed like wasting money which I hate to do...) I really hope this works out.  I have my fingers crossed.

           Richard Perry/The New York Times Simone Assboeck, right, teaches the salsa.     In the Ballroom, a Redefinition of 'Couple' By ERIC MARX  Published: July 14, 2004 As the ballroom dancers glided in unison, mirroring each other's pulsating movements to a midtempo Latin beat, a couple in black body-hugging costumes caught the audience's attention.  Screaming "Go 201, go 201," the onlookers cheered the pair on as they whirled across the room in an athletically sensuous display of high leg kicks, grinding hip turns and pirouettes. The couple, one of 24 teams dancing in the preliminary round of a ballroom dancing contest at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, captured second place in the Latin division.  Only the couple's sex — both are men — hinted at controversy. In letting the dancers, Russell Halley and Jorge Guzman, participate in the competition in April, the organizers of the M.I.T. event for the first time permitted two men to dance together at a championship level. Mr. Halley and Mr. Guzman are also pushing against limits set by the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association, which requires that a competing couple consist of a man and a woman.  The two dancers say that the rules are archaic and that they have proved that two men can dance powerfully and still be artistic. Moreover, they ask, if questions of gay identity and inclusion are being engaged in the workplace and in the bonds of marriage, then why not in professional and amateur sport?   "Did you see the people at M.I.T.?" asked Mr. Guzman, 41, a stock trader who has been dancing with Mr. Halley for three years and who both leads and follows. "They were screaming and jumping. They were happy — straight and gay people — because they understood everything that we were doing."   Competitive ballroom dancing is growing in popularity and is even being considered for inclusion as a medal sport at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Among the arguments advocates have used in pushing for its inclusion is that, like ice dancing or paired skating, dance is one of the rare sports where male and female athletes compete together and on equal terms.  For two years Mr. Guzman and Mr. Halley have competed internationally in gay ballroom dance tournaments in Europe. But such competition is virtually nonexistent in the United States, and the two dancers, who live in New York City, say they have neither the time nor the money to keep flying to competitions in Hanover, Munich and London.  "I'd like to have the opportunity to compete," said Mr. Halley, 40, who runs a talent agency that books stylists and makeup artists.  The International DanceSport Federation, which oversees competitive ballroom dancing worldwide, says that allowing all-male couples alters the fundamental nature of the sport.  "Just as the Hopak dancers do not have to start adding other ethnic groups' elements to their dances because to do so would fundamentally contradict what the dance is about, DanceSport does not have to start adding dances about some other relationship," Jim Frasier, who heads the legal commission of the Europe-based federation, wrote in an e-mail message, referring to the Ukrainian folk dance to explain why his organization has sought to restrict same-sex couples.  Citing as an example the pasodoble, a dance based on movements performed during a bullfight with the man in the central matador role, Mr. Frasier added: "It is performed by a man and woman because it is about the relationship between a man and a woman, using the metaphor of the matador and the cape to express one more aspect of the man/woman relationship."  To many Americans, ballroom is still principally a sexually expressive dance hardly associated with the athletic agility and stamina required of sport. It has failed to gain wide media exposure and sponsorship in the United States but nevertheless has increased in popularity over the past 30 years, both at the grass-roots level in communities, colleges and secondary schools and at private dance studios.  The United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association, based in Virginia, has been pivotal to that growth, notably through investment in its Youth and College Network. But many of its college groups are in open revolt against the association's interpretation of the International DanceSport Federation's ruling, although primarily because it would leave scores of women on the sidelines, unable to compete at two of the association's national competitions. (In ballroom dancing, women outnumber men three to one, according to some estimates.)  Nevertheless, many of those interviewed at the collegiate level say they see this as an equal rights issue for gay men and women: thus the invitation to Mr. Halley and Mr. Guzman.    See?  First you let them marry and next thing they'll all wanna be ballroom dancing!!  To hell in a handbasket, I'm tellin ya!!!

          Bush appeal for gay union ban From correspondents in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin 15jul04 US President George W. Bush today renewed his election-year appeal for a controversial constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage after that effort suffered a Senate defeat.  "I am deeply disappointed that the effort to pass a constitutional amendment affirming the sanctity of marriage as being between a man and a woman was temporarily blocked in the Senate," he said in a statement  .  Um..yeah...the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman like um Britney Spears and whatshisname?  oh and then there's Jennifer Lopez and whoever she's married to these days and um, let's see, oh Donald Trump?  Let's not let gay people get married because, oh gee, they might not get it right and that would just stop the world turning, right???  Sheesh....

          NEVER TO RETURN: Minchin's no-dump guarantee By PAUL STARICK and LEANNE CRAIG 15jul04 SOUTH Australians have been issued "an absolute, unqualified, rolled-gold guarantee" that interstate nuclear waste never will be dumped in the state.  Finance Minister Nick Minchin, who spearheaded the Federal Government's plans for a national dump near Woomera, yesterday guaranteed those plans were abandoned – for all time.  Senator Minchin told The Advertiser he absolutely rejected Labor accusations that the Government would change its mind after this year's election.  Asked if he could give a guarantee this would not happen, Senator Minchin said: "An absolute, unqualified, rolled-gold guarantee."  He said the Government would pursue the states to ensure they created dumps for their own waste.  The move marks a dramatic shift from statements Senator Minchin made as science minister in October 2000 that having nine separate repositories "defies logic".  "The idea we should now build not one, but nine low-level waste repositories is absurd," he said in the October 2000 press release.  Yesterday, he repeated Prime Minister John Howard's promise that a co-located dump for federal low and intermediate-level waste would not be built in SA.  "There are no circumstances under which we will be putting this in SA," he said.  Senator Minchin said even if other states eventually demanded a national repository in SA, against the wishes of Premier Mike Rann, the Government now would not agree.  "If the other state premiers have a problem, they should speak to Mr Rann," he said.  "We tried and failed to acquire land in SA (for a national repository). We now expect Mr Rann to be building a state repository and we will be riding it hard."  Mr Rann said "in this mighty David and Goliath battle – David has won".  "But, you don't win if you don't try and persistence and commitment always pay off, particularly if you are united behind a cause that is a good cause," he said."  "I did not want to see South Australia with the tag `the nuclear waste dump state'."  Both major parties guaranteed they would remove 10,000 drums of radioactive waste stored at Woomera for almost a decade.  Opposition Leader Mark Latham overruled his environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, who said the low-level waste would stay at Woomera.  A spokesman for Mr Latham and Labor industry and science spokesman Kim Carr said Labor would establish a national repository outside SA, then take the Woomera waste there.  Speaking before Senator Minchin, Mr Latham said the Government was "likely to reverse their decision once the election is out of the way".  "For eight years they have been trying to get the dump into SA and the only reason they are saying this today is because there is an election coming up," he said. "People in SA would know that they will be back to their old form as quick as a flash."  Mr Howard said the Government's decision to abandon the dump plans had been forced by "the worst aspects of unco-operative federalism".  "This has come about because of the `not in my back yard (syndrome)'," Mr Howard said.  He said the prospects were "at best, 50-50" of a successful High Court appeal to a Federal Court ruling that the Government's land acquisition process for the dump had been flawed.  "Given the court decision, there was nothing to be achieved by going on," he said.  "If the states are refusing in practice to cooperate, if they're adopting this destructive attitude, then I will flush back on them the responsibility of looking after their own waste.  "If they want to play sovereign state politics, not-in-my-state politics, okay, they can do that.  "But they will have to look after their own waste."  Australian Conservation Foundation executive director Don Henry said the scrapping of dump plans was "a welcome victory for the SA community".  He said South Australians had realised the potency of "people power" and urged them to apply this with renewed energy to saving the River Murray.      No, let's not dump nuclear waste in Woomera. (My birthplace by the way).  But let's continue to incarcerate regugees there in concentration camps.  Refugee women and children...because we're just so convinced that these people are all terrorists..pfffftttt....This sure is not the lucky or the free country for some.

      The navel piercing mystery has been solved.  Thanks  urlLink Michele and Haylie  - you were right. The woman who originally pierced it for me has advised that yes, my body was rejecting the stainless steel bar and that I need to go with gold or titanium.  I don't wear gold, it doesn't suit my skin tone, I'am a silver girl.  So, as soon as this clears up and the scar tissue softens up a bit I am going back again for another go with a titanium piercing.  And I am still thinking about a lower back tattoo.  Something that incorporates my children's names.  Up till now I have referred to them as the Divine Boy and Girl but I guess it's safe to reveal their names.  The boy is nine and his name is Josef.  The girl is six and her name is Eden.  Then again I am not good with pain.  The navel piercing didn't hurt at all last time (must be no feeling in all the flubber)

      Divine Boy and Girl are home.  They are watching a dvd - The Cat in The Hat.  It all feels better.  I am still not ready to get out there and take the world by storm but it's nice hearing them banging around, giggling and just being them.  I have to foray out to the market later...something about needing to feed them... In the last two days or so the only thing I ate was cheese potato bake.  Oh and there was that chocolate last night...yummm...I love dark chocolate.  It kept me awake until 4am this morning and I am starting to think I may be displaying some compulsive tendencies re being on here posting ad infinitum....bah...what can you do????  You know how some people post in their blogs that they have nothing to blog about?  And then they leave it at that?  Not me.  Even when I've got nothing to say I've got plenty to say about having nothing to say.  More about that later.

      The prospect of Saturday night looms...J has emailed me and requested I call him re getting together again.  If it hadn't been for the handholding (not my thing, not on a first date, in fact, well hardly at all).  I know I blogged earlier that I had given up dating but I was coming down with an illness...can I be held repsonsible for everything I rant about in here?  Do I give it another go?  Maybe I could explain that I don't want hand holding and I will kiss when and if I am ready.  Or do I let this one pass?  A has already expressed interest in doing something on Saturday night.  I have told him that he has to invite me to do something by Wednesday's or there are no guarantees....he just got in tonight..but was not specific ....perhaps I will issue him with a rules infringement notice (like the "drunk talk infringement notice" I issued him one night...he woke up with yellow post it note stuck to his forehead reminding him of what he had said in his drunken state) Bloody hell, it's 4.10am and I can't sleep.   Bella needs help.  Obviously.

      Divine Boy and Girl and I live in a small southern city in Australia called Adelaide.  It has a population of just less than a million people.  I live about ten minutes from the city, about 20 minutes from the beach, about 10 minutes from the foothills and about 30 minutes from the Southern wine district (McLaren Vale).  The vineyard that I work in (when we can get up there) is about three hours drive to the north.. at the gateway to the Flinders Ranges, which is an amazingly beautiful area that has to be seen to be believed.  We really are so lucky here to be so close to such a diversity of places.  Adelaide is not a big city and yet is bigger than a large country town.  I love where I live.  I would really like to have some land where we could keep horses.  And thanks Monica, we would love to come and check out Texas!!  Who knows, it may happen!!  If anyone cares to, please leave links to information about where you are from.  I am always interested in new and exciting places.

         In summer of 1863, Gerardus Johannes Droste opened his first confectionary shop in Haarlem. One of his first candy products was the chocolate pastille. This pastille was created with "melt in your mouth" satisfaction in mind. Using only the best Dutch chocolate, the pastille is rounded on the top and flat on the bottom. It fits perfectly between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. Since that time, Droste Pastilles has remained true to the traditions of G.J. Droste and the credo "The Real Taste of Chocolate", becoming one of the largest selling chocolate brands in the world. Droste Pastilles are sold in over 70 countries and is the most recognized Dutch Chocolate. Today, you can still enjoy the same chocolate your ancestors enjoyed, a tradition worth passing on to your children.       Droste Chocolate of Holland - Whether you choose the Pastilles Tube or the chocolate bars, you won’t be disappointed with their decadent taste. The chocolate feels and tastes so good you’re palate will be craving more! Sold in a cases of 12. Individual product is 3.5oz. in size.  Pastille Tubes: $40.88, bars $33.20.

      I'm back.  In my bed.  I've changed the linen and cleaned up the room. I love clean sheets.  I did the dishes.  I still feel like crap.  I have an appointment with the doctor for Friday.  The outcome of which I hope goes like this "Sure, we'll take your uterus out.  Would now suit you?"  I'll spare you the gross details, let's just say that I am starting to look transparent from all the bleeding.  It has been going on and off for weeks now.  I also have a condition called CRPS (chronic regional pain syndrome) which tends to flare up when I'm stressed or not well.  I sound like a hypochondriac!    So, I have told myself, it's ok to have a physical breakdown now because it's holidays.  The boy and girl are staying with their Dad an extra night.  When he bought them home today he looked at me and said "You look terrible".  Well thanks for that. No really, I got quite teary.  With all the stuff that we have gone through in the last couple of months it just got to me.  His noticing and his caring about it.  We sat and had a cup of tea together and he suggested to the children that they spend one more night with him to "let Mummy get some rest so she is able to have more fun with you guys".  Divine Boy wasn't so keen.  Divine Girl was cool.  She is such an easy going kid.  Once I assured Divine Boy that I was going to be ok he agreed.  They are such great kids. The dad gave me a quick hug as they left and said "You just do whatever you need to feel better Bella, you just tell me what you need and I'll be there".  I can't describe how it feels ..it's like the war is over.  So after they left, I picked up and felt lighter and I cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom, put some laundry through and then collapsed on the bed.  Everything feels a bit achey. A came around tonight (even though I told him to stay away because I was feeling off and there was every possibility that I would be a total bitch.  He just laughed and said "So what's new"?).  I told him a bit about what's going on with my insides (surely that would be enough to send him running??).  He gave me a big hug and said "I'd better not mess around with that part of you for a while then".  I looked him straight in the eye and said "Oh great.  And yet you'll still f*ck with my head!!!  Maybe I should start bleeding from the ears?".  He laughed.  He has a great loud booming laugh...it drives me mad and it also makes me laugh too.  So he held me for a while and we just chatted.  He left.  I am all tucked up in bed, having taken some kick ass pain killers and I am sure I will feel better tomorrow.   School goes back next week and I have massage bookings that fill up two whole days.  I have pottery on Tuesday morning and Thursday morning I am working in the leadlighting studio with my sister F.  She has being doing some amazingly beautiful work...I want to start photographing it. I have been working on mirror frames and lamps.  Eventually we will open up our own workshop/gallery.  We are still looking for the right location.  My friend S rang tonight.  It turns out it is her father's birthday today as well.  Happy Bastille Day to everyone btw.  I am wide awake and relatively pain free at the moment.  Which means all manner of nonsense is likely to come spilling out...so I better stop now.  I have a collection of an Australian magazing called "Food Ideas" on the bed with me.  I am going to cut out the recipes I like and put them in a folder.  If anyone is interested in Australian recipes/cuisine let me know and I'll post recipes.  And I'll even put a gingham apron on and a bow (pink) one in my hair.  I may even post a photo....

      Today my dad would have been 76 years old.  He died last year.  He didn't seem old to me.  I am going to walk to the cemetery (not far from here) and put some flowers on his grave.  Happy Birthday George. I love you and I miss you.

      Ok.  I spent most of yesterday on/in and possibly under (we won't ever speak of this again) my bed.  It's cold and wintery here, school holidays, the children are with their father until later today.  I still feel down.  (This morning's discovery of belly piercing disaster has not helped).  I am hormonally challenged and borderline agaraphobic.  With a tendency to over dramatise.  Thank the Goddess for this blog...it gives my friends a break from my phone calls.  My challenge to myelf today is as follows:  Get out of the bed Shower and deal with the hair Clean the kitchen Do the laundry Vacuum the living room Go for a walk to get the heart rate up Prepare a really nice family meal for tonight  Doesn't look that formidable when put like that does it? No.  It doesn't. So I am going to do it. In a few minutes.  No Bella.  Do it now.

      I had my navel pierced about eighteen months ago.  Just a cute little bar with a sparkly gem at the bottom of it.  I didn't display it usually....after two children and all I prefer to keep my belly covered.  It was just something I did for myself.  And of course, studying belly dancing, it looked nice with some of the outfits worn.  It took a while to heal after I had it done.  I was diligent in caring for it and eventually it healed beautifully.  Until last week when it started to look a bit red and the skin a bit dry.  I figured I must have caught it on the waist band of my jeans (strange to call it a waistband when, like all the jeans available now, the band is actually way down on the hips).  So I started applying the disinfectant lotion again and rubbing a bit of vitamin E cream into it.  And I woke up this morning and the bloody thing has come completely out.   The skin has broken completely through.  Now what I have are two little bumps of skin just above my navel.  Aaaaarrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!    Ok, breathe, Bella, breathe.... I have closely inspected and it doesn't appear to be infected and should heal soon and hopefully the scar tissue will settle down and then I won't be permanently disfigured.  And probably I can have it repierced.   But shit like this freaks me out.  (I know, you're probably wondering how I ever managed to get the piercing done in the first place...)  Well, I was toying with the idea of getting a tattoo on my lower back.  My dad had just died and I was doing things a little out there...for me anyways...it was my way of dealing it seems.  Anyway I walked out with the belly piercing instead of a tattoo...  Have just reinspected the belly button.  It really isn't that bad at all.  I am going to call the place where I had it done and talk to them about it.  I wonder if this is a common thing?  I do recall someone telling me a while ago that these type of piercings do 'grow out'.  But after a year and a half?  Maybe it's just my weird skin....  Ohhhhhhhhh dear.  Lucky it's not on my face.  (I had my nose pierced about five years ago but I don't wear it normally unless belly dancing...)  Oh and don't worry...I'm not posting a picture of it!!

      So I rang A and I let him know. I let him know that I was feeling sad (violins in background) and that I wanted him to come over tonight and hold me.  *slaps self across face.  and again.*  Later I sent him a text message saying I am feeling really off colour and need to be alone tonight (which is the truth) and that he should call me later so we can talk.  I have made a cheese potato bake which is in the oven now and I am going to take a hot shower, put on clean pyjamas and take a bowl of abovementioned comfort food to bed with me and watch tv and post more nonsense on my blog.    Anyone care to join me in my self indulgence?  I only have one dvd in the house at the moment.  Monty Python's Life of Brian.  I'm not in the mood for that.  Oh Australian Idol 2 starts tonight.  mmmm....hah... There's Big Brother 4 which is nearing the end....nah OC?....nah  maybe I'll go into one of those naughty chat rooms and give myself a trashy name and pick fights with people.....mmmm maybe.....

      I vaguely remember being awake at 5ish this morning and not being able to get back to sleep I dragged the laptop up onto the bedtop and sought solace in reading my favourite blogs.  Why do you all live in the US???  A was here (yes I know, shoot me) and rolled over in bed, looked at me quizzically and said "Are you online???".    I gave him that look, you know the one that says "Are you STILL here?".  Event of last night a little fuzzy.  So busy shopping yesterday I forgot to eat and then I drank red wine and it's all a bit of a blur after that.  I bought an espresso machine yesterday.  And a dvd player for the children.  And I received, via the mail, a gorgeous pair of black leather driving gloves.  I still have to determine who sent them but I totally love them.  Just the thing for this weather.  They weren't from A.   Last night I yelled at him.  He left.  I decided in my squiffy state that I NEEDED to go out...Monday night in Adelaide...yeah like that's going to be a success...he came back.  I didn't go out, which in retrospect is a very good thing..but it's all so screwed up.  Today I am still wallowing in bed and I may stay here all day.  Oh no, I can't.  I have to go and buy a new charger for my cell phone.  Bugger!!  I found my cell phone, it was in my car.  With a flat battery.  And the charger now won't work.  I wonder if it would be a bad thing if I went in my pj's and ugghies?  My uterus feels like it's about to fall out.  Sorry if that's too much information but there's been all sorts of weird things going on with my insides lately.  It seems like I have a period every other week.  I am all crampy and sick feeling.  I want to ring A and cry and tell him I'm sorry for being such a bitch last night and that he should come back and I'll be good. I promise.  HELL NO.  He needed to hear just how much he pisses me off.  But he's not listening.  He never does.  As soon as I start to talk about how I am feeling or about how he is affecting me he immediately starts to criticize back.  It's so fucking pointless.  It as though he can just tell me that I am wrong and he is right.  End of story.  End of relationship more like.  I am going to ring him and tell him.

      Divine Girl is having her first horse riding lesson this weekend.  I want to find somewhere for us to live where we can keep some horses.  She has ridden before (on a pony) but I want her to learn...the way I did.  She has a way with animals..they love her.  Indiana (new horse up at the vineyard) followed her around the yard and was so gentle with her.  She has no fear of horses.  Our time up in the country has really got me thinking.  About five years from now, about ten years from now....  Their Dad came and collected them a couple of hours ago.  They were so happy to see him and were both jumping up and down like puppies telling him all their news at once.  Divine Boy clung to me a bit before they left. I just want them to be happy and safe. I love those kids so much.  Now what do I do?  I have a couple of days to myself!  I think I'll go shopping. Michele put the idea into my head about a dishwasher.  There's only the three of us here...You know what I really want?  A proper espresso machine....  I don't have any massage clients booked today or tomorrow. I can do whatever I want.  Go shopping, take a long bath...start a new book...  Still sending positive energy and prayers to Michele's family for her Mother.  Makes me appreciate how lucky I am to have my Mum around the corner from here...no matter how daffy she can be sometimes!!

      I can't get to sleep.  And wondering if  urlLink this baby  has arrived yet?  I love babies.  I love the way they look.  The way they smell.  The little baby sounds they make.  Sometimes I really really really want another baby.  Maybe I should go and hold one for a little while and get over it.

      Catching up with the blogs I read on the internet tonight I found out that Michele's mother is in hospital and Michele is worried sick about her. Michele, I hope your Mother is ok and that it turns out not to be serious.  Sending you positive thoughts and wish there was something I could say to help.

      We came back today.  Had a great time but let's face it, taking two Divine children on a five day holiday when you spend four days working in a vineyard does not really qualify as a holiday.  Which is why I am tucked up in bed now, tapping away at the laptop.  The Divine children are washed and fed and nearly asleep.  I am ready for a holiday to get over the holiday just returned from.  Here's how it went:   Watching my friend M get rather squiffy on red wine (what we refer to here in Australia as pissed, shitfaced, and/or cactus) last night.  I abstained because I had the drive home today and didn't want to risk having that red wine headache that would necessitate me driving with my head hanging out the window (yes..I've done it before)  Hearing about M's antics (from G this morning) after I had gone to bed last night.  So glad to know that I am not the only one who says and does (hilarious) stupid things.  He was most amused by her enticing strip tease performed for him, right up until the point where she fell over taking her undies off....and did not get up again  The divine children attended a two day theatre workshop while we were up there.  I had to find something for them to do while I was in the vineyard.  Divine Boy was not so keen on the singing/dancing part but seemed to enjoy the bit where he and the other boys got to "swordfight" with wooden sticks.  Gee, so glad I paid for him to spend two days trying to hit other kids with sticks.  (We could have just left them in the vineyard to do that for free....)  The new horse, Indiana.  He is 16 hands tall and a dark copper colour with a white star on his forehead.  He is totally gorgeous and loved the Divine Girl.  I would not let her on his back this time though because he had only been there a couple of days before we arrived and still is settling in.  We are all learning 'natural horsemanship' and fell in love with this horse at first sight.  The petit verdot vines.  We are training them up onto the wires now.  Pruning these vines involved a lot of kneeling and getting up...I need new knees.  If I can work out how to set up a wish list I will put them on it.  When the legs got too stiff and sore I moved over to the shiraz vineyard (across the creek bed - about ten acres in all).  This pruning involves cutting back to two bud spurs.  Still hard work but at least standing, not kneeling down and getting up...  We all took turns at cooking at night.  (In the daytime we eat like peasants in the vineyard).  The food was really diverse and delicious and went down really well with the last couple of year's vintage.  I found that as I was so tired at the end of each day I could only have one or two at the most.  (Unlike many of the the others!!)  After I put the children to bed at 8.30ish (country air and exercise is very good for them.  They both have rosy cheeks, bright eyes and fell asleep as soon as their little heads hit the pillow) I wasn't far behind them.    I call this my Dreadlock holiday because being in the mid north of the driest state in the driest continent water is something to be conserved.  So showers are quick.  Hair washing is something that waits till you get home.  So my hair (yes, a post could not be made without talking about my hair) started to do it's usual thing  - forming dreadlocks around day two.  Divine Boy thinks I should just let it go that way and be done with it.   Today as soon as I got home I washed it and went through the whole detangling nightmare.  I snuck off and took a look at a house for sale...just dreaming...I could live up there and plant another vineyard and write my book and ride my horses....like I said, just dreaming...the Divine Boy and Girl need to be here in the city for their education and their Dad.    While I was up there with all that clean air, water and the VIEW.  You can see for miles and there have been some good rainfalls and it is so green and beautiful.  I felt lighter than I have in a long time.  I didn't think about anything that has been happening back home here at all.  I got to take some walks and to contemplate that I have more options than I let myself see.  All that hard work....I put my jeans on this morning and they are baggy!!  Yay!!  (So tonight we have Chinese take away when we get home because I am so lazy and such a bad mother and probably they won't be baggy tomorrow.....) Even so, I am determined to keep up a fairly intensive exercise programme from now on and hope to go down a few sizes by Christmas.  Also, there is a vineyard just out of the city that I will be working in over the next few weekends. Pruning. I do this work because I love it.  I love working with the vines and watching the fruit grow and at the end of it all drinking the gorgeous wines produced by this fruit.  It was so cold up there.  The days were around 10 degrees celcius and the nights were icy.  Coming back home I realised that we have had even more rain here.  I am looking forward to Spring.  The Divine Girl and I have gone through so much lip balm (our lips react to cold air...very red and sore)  Our cat was very happy to see us.  My neighbour very kindly fed him for us while we were away.  I forgot to cater for the fish.  They were still swimming the right way up and seemed relieved to see us.  If a fish can look relieved....well, they looked the way I think relieved fish would look...  So there is one week left of this term's holiday.  Tomorrow night the Divine children go to their father's house.  I will have a couple of days to myself.  I want to get my house in order.  I can't find my cellphone.  It is probably lying on the ground among the vines...lol...so there has been no contact with anyone.  I have decided not to date anymore.  I want to grow old alone and plant flowers and look after horses and grow vines and write books and be a better grandmother than I am a mother.  I don't want to argue or do battle with the children's father anymore.  I don't want to see A.  I don't want to explain to anyone why sometimes I am so sad that I can't be reached.  I just want to accept it as it is and make the best of it all.

      It's 9.55pm. No sign of A and that's ok because the pain in my lower back and legs right now is pretty consuming. Dear reader, please don't bother with this paragraph. It is simply an exercise for me to distract myself. From this pain. It's not the sort that you can writhe around in trying to find a way to be in less discomfort. It just is. The nerves at the base of my spinal cord are being subjected to pressure which is not a good nor a healthy thing. When I close my eyes it's like I visualise the pain being like electric blue lightning....and the storm is a big one right now. I am concentrating on keeping my beathing deep and regulated. Sometimes when in pain, we tend to hold our breath and breath shallowly and quickly. This has the effect of increasing pain. I took some pain killers and instead of taking the edge off the pain they seem to have taken the edge off me.   The children are in bed and quiet. They were such sweethearts tonight. They tidied up their rooms and the living room and even stacked their dishes in the kitchen. They are so sweet. Divine Boy wanted to call the doctor for me and wantd to make me a cup of tea. I don't want to risk him having an accident with hot water so I told him I was ok but that I love him for wanting to help. They really are special people and I can am so proud of how they are turning out.   I think I will go now and read some other blogs until I fall asleep. A said he would be here at 9 but it's better that he doesn't come. I'll just turn out the lights.&nbsp; And switch off me cellphone.&nbsp; He'll understand.

      See, give Divine Boy time enough and he'll find the can of whipped cream.  He just fessed up.  He told me he made a banana split in his mouth.  (One less bowl to wash) We never had cream in a can before.  Oughta keep them occupied for the next five minutes or so.

      A good relationship is one where you bring the best out in each other. You can still argue, sulk, feel let down, feel joyous, revel in each other's closeness and love the way that person smells...and you must bring out the best in each other.  A and I seemed to do that for so long.  What's happening?  Once I used to feel that I understood and accepted him and that he returned that.  Now where are we?  Not together, and miserable apart.  Fearful.  Wary.  Tired. I know that he will come over here tonight and that I will lie next to him and just know that I don't want to be with anybody else and that I am waiting to hear him say the same.  But it isn't going to come.  Is that what he means by 'running scared"? Pity I let the Divine Ones stay home today because I'd like nothing more than to just lie here and sob my heart out. (Don't want to scare them)  Think the pain killers might be kicking in.  I'm feeling woozy.  Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee......

      Yay it's Friday.  How's this for really bad mothering?  The children are home from school today.  It's freezing cold and raining out there and when I woke up I couldn't move without a lot of pain so now here I am, and the Divine Ones are out there watching Monty Python movies.  I have gotten up a few times and pushed food at them, which I have found is a really good way to keep them under control.  A rang me.  He says he loves me and that he's 'running scared".  I don't know exactly what he means by that.  All I've done is gone on a couple of dates and then had C over for dinner the other night. I'm not keeping secrets, I'm not sleeping around.  We're not married, there's no plans to live together again.  But I want what I want and I'll go after what I want.  I want peace, I want laughter, I want pretty things.  When I get what I want I'm an absolute angel to be around.  Really I am....lol  Soccer game is at stupid o clock tomorrow morning.  I am going to have to take some of those kickass pain killers to get up offa this bed and get Divine Boy's gear together.  And I am going to have to get moving tomorrow.  Divine Boy can't miss a game.  Sure, today he can miss school...but soccer? No way.  I couldn't get in and out of the car this morning, let alone use my foot on the clutch.  Tomorrow I'll call a taxi if I can't drive.  Ok enough whingeing.  I have inflamed discs in my lower back which are uber inflamed at the moment and are pressing on my spinal cord.  The inflammation will go down and I can resume normal life.  I have to learn to ask for help.  My sister is working.  My mother is too elderly and has hip problems at the moment.  A is at work and there's no way I'd let him see me looking like this.  The children's father isn't working today but experience has taught me not to ask.  Divine Boy is wonderful.  He is going to go to the bakery on the corner (two doors down) and get us some really fattening doughnuts.  Australian doughnuts are not like American doughnuts.  American doughnuts are way nicer.  But what can you do when you live in Oz?  A wants to come over later tonight (he is taking his daughter out to dinner and a movie.  This is good news because for quite a while she has refused to see him.  She is a really lovely kid and whatever else he can be, he loves her and he is HER dad.  A girl always needs her father.  I'm glad that they are seeing each other again.)  Divine Boy just came back.  NO DOUGHNUTS!!  They sold out.  Well, my butt will be thankful.  Yesterday my mother commented "Sweetie, you are LOSING WEIGHT!! Please take better BETTER care of yourself!". This from the woman who gave me the genes for eventual and seemingly inevitable embiggening...and the same woman who would be the first to tell me (about three hours after the birth of Divine Boy) that I was going to have to get my figure back to keep my husband IN LINE. (Um, mum, he's a musician who was constantly on "tour" when our children were born...you don't keep men like that in line...you just don't)  I am 5 foot 11 inches and when I was in my twenties I became an obsessive gym workouter person and got my weight down to 61 kilos....nowadays I sometimes fantasise about doing that again but being a bit older I think it would make me look....sick.  Nah, I'll just stay fat and happy.  At least I know my dates are into me for my brilliant mind...lol...oh and the fact that I am a kickass cook.  And on a mercurial note....Dear Reader, notwitstanding short term memory loss, that stuff I wrote about the other night...you know the bit where I played with the idea of giving this blog away and disappearing into the blogging sunset?  well PFFTTTTTT....I DUN THINK SO....I'm here to stay, whinging, whining, saying how it is too so not fair and all that jazz.....  I am Gemini...Hear me CHANGE MY MIND.  Over and over and over...

      Wanted to stay in bed this morning because Divine Ones were with the Dad.  But I had to get to Leadlighting.  My sister was there.  That was good.  Five siblings and she is the one who I know is there for me and me for her.  I don't know what has happened with the rest of the family.  After my father's death some really weird stuff went down and now noone is talking to anyone.  Except my closest sister and I.  I love her.  She loves me.  Fiercely and very protectively.  I am so lucky.  A ringing last night and being all mean and nasty.  That was bad.  I now know that I am in an addictive cycle with him.  It always ends up with me feeling hurt.  I want to break the cycle.  And I want to work things out with him. But it seems like the nice loving him isn't really him, that's just what he shows you to get you in place for the next great big plummeting disappointing drop. I'm so tired in my heart about it all.  Thinking up a new design for a leadlight mirror frame.  Measuring, designing and choosing colours.  That was good.  I'm a details person.  Obsessively, almost.  That's why I keep an online journal.  I come in here and just pour everything out, all the details.  I don't read over it, I hope noone else wastes too much time on it.  I love the comments that do come in, because they make me laugh. That is good.  Back pain today, sitting, standing, lying down - no respite.  That's bad. Because it makes me irritable and depressed (and depressing).  It makes me grumpy with the children.  It makes me feel wrong.  C emailing me today about last night's dinner.  That's good. C wanting to know when we can go out again.  That's not bad, that's just pressure.  Me being awake late into the night, my head full of all these things, well that's life.  Tomorrow, today, I'm giving myself permission to be whatever it takes to be ok.  I think I will wait until this passes before I post again.  I will go and read all of your blogs because you make me laugh and you help me to forget my crap for a while.  But then, I know me, I'll be back in here rattling away again by the afternoon.  Have a wonderful day, whatever you are doing.  Think of me drooling on my pillow.

      I need a digital camera.  I am using a webcam to take pictures and they are way blurry.  So are my eyes now. I'm tired.  I'm pissed off.  I don't want to whine and moan so I'm going to take a break now for a while.  I don't want to write in here when I know that there are certain persons who think that because they can come in here they are entitled to give me a hard time about my life....   To all the people who I read on the internet...I think you are wonderful and I find you endlessly interesting and I will continue to read your blogs and to somehow feel that there is a connection that transcends borders. I may even email you and let you know when and where I start my new blog.  But for now, the sun sets on One Perfect Day.  And then again, tomorrow's another day and quite possible the sun will rise again and it will be an even more Perfect Day.  Have a great day everyone.  Think of me turning and tossing and kicking the covers off.  LOL  Bella

      Ya wanna know something I learnt (perhaps a little too late) tonight?  Is that there are people out there who just love it when they can go all righteous and be really mean to you.  And that is why they keep you close.  They give you just enough to make you want to be around and trust them but they do it so that, first chance they get, they can kick you in the ass.  For just telling your own truth.  Yes, friends, we have a new reader.  His name is...well it doesn't really matter what his name is.  Let's all make him feel welcome.  He won't bother leaving comments, but he will ring and try to make me feel bad about being me.  There isn't anything in this blog that I won't stand behind.  It's just writing...well I don't need to explain ....you guys all know why we do this..  So sue me for having someone over for dinner. Which went really well.  The food was really good and it was really nice to be able to cook without being told how, when and where, without feeling rushed.  It was relaxing.  It was fun.  But there will be consequences....*snorts*  So, to take my mind off things I am now going to post pictures of my place.  MY PLACE.  Where I am allowed to have gentlemen callers and friends.  And where my children laugh and play and eat and sleep and grow and love.  Without feeling like they are walking around on eggshells.  It's time for me to let go and to start feeling good about what's ahead.    So welcome new reader.  But seriously, you won't listen to me so why the F*** do you want to come and read my blog?

      Did I mention the mother at school who obviously can't drive safely and then why the F*** is she driving a great big four wheel drive? Seriously I wouldn't trust her to push a pram.  Which she will be doing soon.  Poor Baby.  I mean it, Poor Baby.  And then there's the one about the massage client who repeatedly arrives fifteen minutes late for appointments and then has the nerve to comment on "oh that was only a 50 minute massage!?".  Stupid woman.  No wonder her hair is cut so badly.  She probably does the same thing at the hairdressers.  I had to go racing to the children's school to take them a freshly prepared and heated lunch.  No, this does not mean I am an extra goody good mother.  It just means that I wasn't getting it together terribly efficiently this morning. I was running a few minutes late (refer to stupid woman in above paragraph who kept massage client number 2 waiting while she took forever to get her shit on and get out).  You should have seen the children's faces.  You'd think I hadn't fed them in a week.  And the teacher in Divine Girl's class....gave me that look...and I just wanted to say "Oh shut up, you don't know"...but of course I didn't.  C is coming for dinner tonight.  I have been racing around shopping for exotic ingredients (obsessive compulsive disorder - it has to be just that much better, ya know??).  Why am I doing this?  I like him and all but I don't know if I want to be seeing him.  And if I am seeing him, what am I going to do about A?  And should either of them know?  I think not.  After all, I'm only sleeping with one of them. It's just dinner tonight.  Why am I so compelled to make everything so damned special??  Bloody hell, he should be taking me out to dinner.  Oh, that's right.  He has already.  Oh Goddess, please let this day get better.   Surely 2.00pm in the afternoon is not too early to put some vodka in my juice?  And you know what else?  I am going to wear my pink velour trakky daks tonight with my ugghies and my white hooded top.  I am not going to wear makeup (I don't anyway) and I  am not even going to put on perfume.   I usually have candles lit around the house anyways (old habit from wiccan pagan running around naked on full moon nights phase of my life) but I will make sure it does not look like I have a seduction planned.  The trakkies and the ugghies should make that pretty bloody clear.  Oh and the nerdy ugly girl glasses.  And maybe I'll throw the ocelot ears in for good measure.  What do ya think???  Oh and for those of you who are wondering (pfft..noone but do I care?) the menu for tonight is:  Atlantic Salmon with a garlicky peppery lemony crust served on steamed asian greens and with baby potatoes tossed in BUTTER - (yes that's right Jenny Craig I said BUTTER) and freshly chopped herbs from the garden.  And on the side will be bowls of Greek salad and freshly baked dinner rolls.  This will be accompanied by an unwooded Chardonnay from the Barossa Valley...not sure which one yet so will chill a couple...  Desert will be apricot/orange/cinnamon pastry parcels (made by yours truly) served warm with whipped cream...from a spray can....lol.  After that I want to put my feet up and fall asleep in my chair.  Oh and Divine Boy and Girl are having a mid week stay with their dad.  Gotta run, next door neighbour is coming up the drive...shit, shit, shit....

      After my little outburst this morning I went and read comments left to me by some of you people. Yes, you know who you are Michele, Monica and Genuine and Lanie.  (Not enough time to link right now but will do it later)  YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST and life has definitely been easier to laugh at since finding your blogs.  I have just spent the last five minutes rolling on the floor laughing my bottom off...(that's gonna take some laughing I can tell YOU!)  I am no longer shaking with anger, now I'm shaking when spontaneous chuckles continue to erupt...and I have a client due in about ten minutes...lol...one thing about being a massage therapist is you have to be careful not to laugh (for no reason apparently) around half/fully naked clients..they can be a bit sensitive and all....LOL.....  I just know I'm gonna crack up when I start thinking about it.  Quick, think of something else Bella....*deep breathe* *snort* LOL

      The following is me, letting off steam BIG TIME because of something that occurred this morning which has left me shaking and really PISSED OFF.  It is addressed to a particular person and I may very well email it to her when I am done.   Ok Tara.  Yes, I'm naming you here because I don't care.  My daughter has been friends with your daughter since kindergarten and your daughter is a lovely little girl.  Who acts out aggressively at times.  Not her fault, considering the home environment that you and your partner(?) provide for her.  You have told me yourself that there is domestic violence involved between the both of you.  No wonder your child thinks it is appropriate to hit other children as soon as things don't go her way.  The school stepped in and enrolled her in a course to teach her social skills that will help her to integrate back into the classroom.  Ever occurred to you that it just might be YOUR responsibility to do this?  Huh?  No, of course not. You'd much rather spend your time hanging around the parking lot of the school moaning,whining and bitching. I have had you at my house BECAUSE our daughters have a friendship.  When your daughter has behaved aggressively towards my children I have not shunned her (like so many other parents of children at her school) but I have sat down quietly with her and listened to her frustration.  I care about your daughter because she is a beautiful person and my daughter loves her.  I have had you here and patiently bitten my tongue while you bitch and whine and moan about EVERYBODY - family and well I can't say friends, you don't seem to have ANY.  And you say you don't understand why other parents avoid you???  You have had conflict with just about every other parent in your daughter's class.  I tried to stay out of it.  I once tried gently to tell you that it is the place that your daughter attends school - NOT necessarily the place for you to base your entire social life. I finally cracked a couple of weeks ago.  I have been feeling unwell and have had my own worries and that morning that you came and started up with me I just forgot to bite my tongue.  I told you that you are the most negative person I have ever encountered and that I just did not have the energy to listen to anymore of your shit.  I considered apologising later but I didn't. And I haven't.  Because I really do feel that you need to be aware of how you make people feel.  I won't bite my tongue around you anymore.  I can't. So this morning when you deliberately turned your car in front of me - at a f*cking stop sign!! - well I take that as a deliberate act of aggression.  I had to hit the brakes and I had my children in my car with me!!  You deliberately tried to cause an accident!!  I can't believe you would do such a stupid and aggressive thing - especially when you are a couple of weeks away from having a baby?!!  You stupid woman.  (I feel sorry for the poor baby that has to come into your dysfunctional family and endure your lazy, unrealistic approach to parenting.)  Ok, I have stopped shaking.  But let me warn you.  Don't come near me.  Just add me to the list of people who avoid you like a disease.  I now know that there really are people who are as ugly on the inside as they are on the outside.  Yes, that's you.  You are an ugly person.  I hope our children can continue to be friends at school.  Sadly, I cannot have your daughter over here to play anymore and I think that is a shame for her.  But I will not have you around me or my children ever again.  Maybe this time you may have learnt not to involve your daughter in your nasty mouthing off. One can only hope.  But pull a stunt like that with me again BITCH and I promise you - I will make sure that you are brought to account for your actions.

      A arrived and set up the massage table, lit a candle, put on some relaxing music and warmed the towels.  Wow....  I made sure the children were settled then went and had a hot shower.  After that I hopped up on the table.  My back didn't like it at first - lying on my front - but after a while it got better.  A has a different style of massage to me but WOW.  He really gets into the knots and the sore points and shows NO MERCY.  I have this tendency to laugh and giggle when something hurts (weird, I know) so the whole thing must have sounded bloody hilarious.  But after an hour of massage I feel so much better.  I had no idea how tense I was. No wonder I have been feeling like a crazy woman...One hour of massage...if that's how good I make my clients feel I think I'm gonna have to charge more!   So now I feel very spoilt and pampered and it's about time! A has gone home.  He was really tired and we thought it best.  Tee hee...silly man, made me so relaxed and happy and sleepy with no sex involved... So here I am all tucked up in bed with the laptop (breaking my curfew again for the second night in a row, on the second night since I placed said curfew upon my nocturnal blogging activities). So little time, and so many blogs to read!! Well, off I go.  Have a really good day everyone and think of me snoring away on the other side of the world!!

      Potter's class this morning went well.  Am working on a bowl which is going to have a leaf design on the outside of it.  Clay really dries your hands out. *reaches for the vitamin E cream*  But it felt really good.  Gave a massage (really have to keep hands soft) and then got out in the garden in the sunshine and did a couple of hours of weeding.  And cut the climbing rose bushes back.  They are climbing all over the neighbours side of the fence and this way I hope to get to see more of him...tee hee.  Seriously, even without hair he is kinda cute.  Yesterday morning it was so cold that my car stalled backing out of the driveway (the school run) and it wouldn't start again.  I knew that I had 'flooded' it with gas and would just have to wait a couple of minutes but it was comforting to see him standing at his car with that look on his face, you know the one that says "You want me to come and do the man thing and make it work for you?".  I would have fervently nodded YES YES YES, but I hadn't had a shower (yet) and I had trakky daks on and my ugghies and my nerdy ugly girl glasses. I'd rather he came and did the Mr Fix it / Super Rescue Dude when I have black stockings and Coco Chanel and red lip gloss on.  Oh, and the rest of my clothes too, of course. Nah, he's just the guy get next door who laughs at me when I hang out the laundry with a green face mask on.  He laughs at me when he sees me playing by myself on the kid's trampoline (after vodka shots...not a good look).  And he's heard me doing my insane mother who should be locked up act.  I'm going to have to clean my act up obviously. Anyhoo, I digress.  I worked really hard in the yard and it is looking heaps better.  But the grass needs to be cut.  Tomorrow, if there is sunshine, I will try and get it done really early.   C is coming over tomorrow night after he plays basketball which means I have to clean my house.  I have two massages booked so that leaves me pretty free in the afternoon to do it.  I just hope that I don't lose this sudden burst of motivation and energy. I made carbonara pasta for Divine Boy and myself for dinner tonight. Divine Girl went to "Joeys" (Scouts) with her dad and it was Carb City here.  I don't care.  I can eat carbs.  It's when I lay around on my lazy a** that I put on weight. A is coming over later to give me a back massage.  I am sore.  And who gives the massage therapist a massage huh?  Good old A. We talked today.  Neither one of us has any answers.  I keep flip flopping back and forth like a fish out of water...guess I'll just leave this one to the universe for a while and see where it goes... Had two lattes from G's cafe around the corner.  And not much else until dinner. No wonder I was buzzing around like a bee! Oh and the other best thing about today was I found my ocelot ears headband.  I've had it for a few years and I wear it at home a) to keep my hair out of my face/way and b)they make me happy.  And they'd probably make the next door neighbour laugh too.  Except I won't wear them outside.  When I put them on I am the Supreme Kitten House Cleaner.  It helps.  Really. Hey, it's 8.30.  I have to go and supervise Divine Ones teeth brushing and tucking in and huggies and kissies and telling them that I love them so so so much.  Divine Boy entertained me tonight with his Monty Python's Life of Brian Monologues.  He's got an incredible memory for that and he had me in fits of laughter.  He loves having one on one time with me and I love that time with him too.  Ok, back later to post photo of above mentioned ocelot ears. Divine Boy has just come in and 'mooned' me.  Yay me.  Heh, you shoulda seen his face when I said I was gonna post a pic of THAT on the blog.  (He has no idea what the blog is).  I just told him that I would put the picture on the net where everyone could see the bad moon a rising....tee hee..

      I am going to be strict with myself and turn the computer off at 10.30pm at night.  Then I am going to get some sleep. It's too tempting to stay on wandering around the blogs and reading...all a little too stimulating for the brain and I need my sleep!!  I have started playing around with templates...I need to learn how to write in HTML.  Thanks to Kris for sending me some really good reference material.  And tomorrow I am going into the potters studio to play with clay again.  I need to go and buy a digital camera.  So, while I am off in the land of nod, I hope you are all having a good day and doing good things.  Bon nuit!!

      Charles Melton Winery in Tanunda (about an hour and a half drive north of Adelaide)buys the grapes from the vines that we tend up at Laura (about a two and a half hour drive north of Adelaide. This is where I took the children for our holidays last week.    Since 1994 we have been working with a small group of growers who have developed Shiraz and also Cabernet vineyards in the Southern Flinders Ranges. This new viticultural region is around 180km from the Barossa and moves from the township of Laura further north to Mount Remarkable. The land is surprisingly varied and encompasses sites ranging from spectacular hillsides through to low yielding creek plains.  The oldest of these vineyards is now giving us grapes that are allowing us to make the sort of wine that we always believed this exciting new area had the potential to do.    Whilst sharing the richness and weight of the Barossa wines the Laura wines show a sweeter perfume and less of the spice that we see from our Tanunda gardens!!  By the way…. The trophy for "Most Outstanding Effort in Promoting Humour During Vintage (or at least it was funny for everyone else to see Charlie, James and Tim flee from the crusher in lightening speed)" goes to one of our Laura growers who packed their grape delivery bin with a surprise rubber snake.      Tee Hee Tee Hee...the fun you can have with rubber snakes, heh!!

      The following are excerpts from an email I received today.  Anyone interested in the refugees being kept imprisoned in this country might want to read on:      Dear Bella,  In the last couple of weeks there have been again a lot of news stories in the press surrounding refugees in Australia. I assume you read about Amanda Vanstone's press release "that only one child remains in a detention centre" or you have heard that many Afghans from the Nauru detention centre arrived in Australia or you heard last weeks about the changes for TPV holders. But as there is always a possibilities that you missed out on some of these events I would like to give you some additional information and apologize for any cross-posting about this matters.   1. Our immigration minister's big announcement that "just one child remains in detention because the mother refused to leave her husband in the Baxter detention centre" can only be described as a deliberate lie, because at the time of her announcement 101 children were still in detention. She simply ignored 19 mostly Iraqi children still detained on Nauru and 11 Vietnamese kids on Christmas Island, in Villawood were still 30 children detained (meanwhile many of them have been transferred to the Baxter detention centre or housing project), 3 kids are still in Maribyrnong in Melbourne and the rest are either detained in the Baxter housing project or under home detention in Adelaide.  Additionally there are because of the length of detention young people at Baxter who are now over 18 but were children when they were first incarcerated, eg: Former unaccompanied minor Afghan boy - now >18, detained since Woomera opened (Nov 99), now at Baxter girl - 20 yr old Iranian, was 16 when detained, never at school, detained since Curtin early 2000, now at Port Augusta boy - 18 yr old Iranian, was 14 when detained, never at school, detained since Curtin early 2000, now at Baxter boy - 19 yr old Afghan (+ 4 little siblings all still under 18), detained since Woomera January 2001, now at Baxter  2. Last week the last group of refugees from the Nauru detention centre whose case had been re-opened and then positively assessed arrived in Australia on a temporary protection visa (TPV) after all of them had to spent 2 to 3 years of their live incarcerated. I am very happy that many people finally gained their freedom (though only temporarily) but we shouldn't forget that there are still about 100 people locked up on Nauru, most of them are Iraqis, who are becoming increasingly desperate not knowing what will happen to them.  3. Last week Amanda Vanstone announced that all the refugees on temporary protection visas are now allowed to apply for permanent visas. So far this wasn't possible for them and they had to leave the country if they wanted to apply for a permanent visa (with more or less no chance of success). After this announcement many refugee advocates celebrated these changes but soon realized that this was a bit pre-mature. In the following the pro and cons listed by somebody from the Refugee Resource Centre in Melbourne (the cons definitely outweigh the pros).  WHAT DO THE CHANGES MEAN?  Is it good news? YES and NO  YES The new changes mean that asylum seekers on Temporary Protection Visas will be allowed to apply for other types of visas that they were previously barred from.  DIMA has not said what these visas are yet but they are likely to include Close Ties, Skilled Visas, Employer Sponsorship.  This MAY increase the chance of SOM asylum seekers on TPV getting permanent visas  (please note that all people on TPV's are already deemed to be refugees and in all other countries in the world would be accepted permanently because of this status)  NO 1 No automatic granting of permanent visas.  Applicants will have to apply for another visa on top of applying for a Protection Visa.  They will have to prove they meet the criteria for one of the other visas.  2 This compounds their anxiety and trauma.  No details have been released how this is going to work.  3 The process could take up to 6-18 months and keep people again in limbo which has been so disturbing already.  4 This is still a denial that these people have already been deemed to be refugees and should have permanent protection as outlined in the International Convention on Refugees to which Australia is a signatory.  DOES THIS REPRESENT A MORE HUMANE GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD ASYLUM SEEKERS  NO. The rhetoric makes it sound as though the majority of the 9,500 people on TPV will get permanent visas. In fact what it seems is that they will have to apply for highly sought after immigration visas along with the many thousands of others around the world who also apply for these places. If the Government were genuinely concerned about a humane approach they could 1 automatically have granted all TPV holders permanent protection immediately 2 Not be still trying to send people back to Iraq with offers of money 3 End Mandatory detention, the Pacific Solution and use of TPVs when people have been assessed as refugees.  WHICH ASYLUM SEEKERS WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE VISAS? All people on TPV's and those coming from Nauru  WHAT ABOUT ASYLUM SEEKERS ON BRIDGING VISAS? These changes do not apply to anyone on these visas and these are the majority of Asylum Seekers  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE SYLUM SEEKER RESOURCE CENTRE? 70% of the people who use the services are on Bridging visas.  The majority have no work rights, no medical cover, no access to Centre Link and only survive because of the services of organisation like ASRC for food, shelter legal and medical assistance.  However ASRC will now also need to help 500 families and others on TPVs to apply for another visa plus the protection visa.  This means there will be an extraordinary amount of legal work.  The need for organisations like the ASRC will be greater than ever.  For more information see the ASRC website = www.asrc.org.au

      I have a disc in my lower back pressing on my spinal cord.  Not very comfortable.  And after the last week my tolerance for pain and feeling tired is wearing thin.  Not to mention that Saturday night's little foray into a few vodka shots too many...I think perhaps I have no right to complain.  But I'm going to anyway.  Just for this paragraph. Ouch.  Have rung the surgery re results from Friday's tests and the doctor wants me to go in and see him to discuss them. I'm thinking this may result in removal of a uterus (mine) and to this I say YAY!!  Basically, I should sit Divine Boy and Girl down and tell them they are not getting their security payment back on my uterus because they did not leave it in very good condition at all.  Once again, just I'll just be adding weight to the argument that their mother is a total nutjob.  Anyway, Monday Monday....I went to an early belly dancing class and was falling behind by the end of the lesson.  It is freezing cold (well here in Adelaide 11 degrees is what we call freezing cold).  It was hard to drag ourselves out of bed this morning to get to school on time, after two weeks of holidays. But I did it.  A solid hour of dancing is good exercise.  When I got home A called.  Seems that someone related to me (who shall remain nameless) sent him an email containing a nasty virus.  It's a bit of a mystery.  I don't know that I can be bothered doing the detective work because whilst on the one hand I understand that there is at least one relative of mine who is no fan of his, I can't imagine this person/anyone actually doing something like that.  And who would send something like that with their email address attached??  I'm thinking a virus has gotten into someone's address book somewhere. Either that or my sister really did do it in which case tee hee.... No harm done to his computer.  His ego is more likely to be causing him problems with regard to this.  Anyhoo....I am going to make some fruit bread tonight.  With the bread maker.  The loaf which it turned out last night was really good. I get lazy and leave the breadmaker in the cupboard but it's out again now.  It tastes so much better than store bought bread and makes the house smell nice.  Look at me, I'm turning into June Cleaver.  Just let me pop into my gingham apron and put some lippy on, mkay?  The Divine Ones want me to make popcorn (I found the popcorn maker at the back of the same cupboard that the breadmaker was hiding in..)  I have said I will provided they clean up some of their most recent trashings.  It's pretty quiet out there at the moment.  This either means cleaning or no cleaning is being done.  I'll go with the no cleaning...usually when they clean they fight with each other because they are so pissed off at having to clean / do anything..... Popcorn makes the house smell good too.  Did I mention that it's cold here?  Brrrrrr....but it's not raining...yet.  I bought a different coloured folder to put my summer recipes into.   Which colour gingham apron should I go with, red or blue I wonder.  Quick, pass the lip gloss again.  I can't wait until the summer.  I am enrolling Divine Boy in a "learn to surf" summer programme.  Hey, if I can shed a few more (ok, at least 20) kilos then I might do it as well.  Maybe not with him.  Wouldn't want to embarrass the little guy.  So, in preparation I have to go and research surfboards for little guys (and possibly for mother's as well).  I think Divine Girl will probably 'get on board' as well.  Just thinking about summer makes me feel better.  Well, I better go and see what's happening out there....it's way too quiet.

      I got to sleep most of the hangover away. At 10am I rang C and told him that tonight's dinner was OFF.  He wasn't real happy about that....so I told him to come around on Wednesday night after he plays basketball.  It will be the first time he has been to my house.  I have organised with the children's father for them to stay with him.  Then I got up and showered, dealt with my hair (see previous posts for long winded descriptions of what's involved, cleaned up from the night before (finding one empty vodka bottle on the floor of the living room) and put on sunglasses and lip gloss.  A came back from golf and we went for a walk around the corner to my favourite cafe.  We sat on the black leather sofa there and read the paper, ate the most amazing torte and drank coffees.  We chatted to the owner of the cafe and to each other.  There was lots of laughter and I felt so much better.  I loved being with him.  When A and I are together we can do it so well....we are so comfortable and I was feeling really good.  And my hair was clean and shiny and straight and dreadlock free which always helps.  Then we wondered back to my house.  I sent him into the shower (he had come straight from playing golf).  Then we went to bed.  Mmmmm..lovely afternoon shagging, and this time I was fully cognizant and aware of the acts that I was more than happy to perform upon his person).  Afterwards, lying there in that glow, I decided it was time to broach upon a subject or two which we do really need to discuss.  Well duh, stupid me.  After sex, A performs a ritual which he refers to as 'blissing out'.  Basically it consists of him falling asleep.  Well, there just wasn't time for that.  I need to know what we are doing!  We see each other, we sleep together, there have been so many expressions of love and intimacy...a decision needs to be made!! He woke up enough to hear me out but his responses are uncertain and vague.  So that's made my mind up.  I will keep my options open.  If he doesn't want to commit, then he will have to put up with sharing me.  And I am not prepared to share him.  If he wants to go elsewhere then he is welcome to do so.  However, I will not have anything further to do with him.  I know this may sound like double standards, but it is not. I am not sleeping with anyone else and I have no intentions of doing so.  If I were to, then that would be the end of A and I.  That's just how I am made.  He is the one who seems to want for us to spend time together and he wants to talk to me on the phone every night but when I ask him to define who we are to each other he starts giving me this weird kind of double speak.  Idiot.  So I get up and start preparing for the return of the children.  A went home (he is living with his parents...hmmmmm) and I cooked for the children and I.  Then they had their showers, we watched tv together.  Something on tv made me get quite teary and the children noticed. I explained to them that it made me think about how much I love them and miss them when they are not with me and that they are the most loved and cherished people in the whole world.  I reassured them (once again) that their Mother is a very emotional woman who cries tears when she is happy and sad.  That sometimes their Mom just has to have a little weep and then get on with things.  Five minutes later we were all laughing uproariously at something amusing.  I tell my children that Mom laughs just as much as she cries and that tears are not bad things, they are just sad feelings manifesting in a physical way.  End result....bemused children who understand their mother is a nut job.  And they went off to bed like little puppies at 8.30. School goes back tomorrow so I have to set the alarm.  I came to bed and then C rang.  We spoke on the phone for hours.  I am looking forward to seeing him here on Wednesday but also a little apprehensive.  Even though I am not ready for any intimacy with anyone else, it stands to reason that if I am dating others, and having another man around for dinner then there is a chance that eventually it will happen. And that will be the end of A and I.  I wasn't implying or threatening A with that earlier, but what does he expect me to do?  He won't give me anything to work with and I am 41.  I haven't got time to waste sitting around waiting for him to decide.  I don't want to grow old on my own.  I want a partner.  So here I am, not sleeping again.  It's 2.45am and I don't want to be a grump when I get up at 7.00am.  This week is a busy busy one for me.  I have belly dancing tomorrow, pottery on Tuesday, Chris for dinner on Wednesday, Leadlighting on Thursday and numerous massage appointments to fit in amongst all of this.  At least it means that I will not be hanging around my bed feeling crappy like last week.  The bleeding seems to have stopped (touch wood).  Oh and tonight I trimmed the ends of my hair.  I have been doing this for a while, I can't see the point in paying a hairdresser thirty dollars to do it when I can do it myself.  I took off about an inch in all and it looks so much better.  And another thing.  I am going to make Wednesday of each week my 'weigh in'day.  I refuse to post what my actual weight is on this  blog (I have serious body image issues) but I am going to keep a record of losses/gains.  If/when I get near my goal weight I will advise what that is.  I'm thinking if I make myself accountable to you guys, then that will work as a motivation tool.  But don't worry, I don't expect anyone to give a rats....  so have a good week everyone....if I think of anything to write about I will do so .....Love and light to you all!

      I was awake most of night before....caught up on this life sucking time machine...I fell asleep about 6am with Divine Girl sleeping next to me, taking up most of the queen size bed.  I slept until nine when Divine Boy came home from his sleepover at the neighbours.  The neighbours, P and M are really fun, party loving people.  I feel perfectly at ease letting Divine Boy spend the night there..they have three boys and he loves having 'boy time'.  Anyway, he came in woke me up and asked permission to go riding his bike with his friends.  I blinked blearily at him and said "Yes, eat something first, wear your helmet and put on warm pants".  He went off and I went back to sleep.  Saturday morning this is not such a bad thing to do.  Divine Girl gets up, turns on the cartoons, get's her Crunchy nut cornflakes and her blanky and is happy for a while.  Next thing I knew she was in on the bed with me saying "Mummy, when are you going to wake up???".  I had been dozing on and off and having really weird dreams.  I figured it was about 10.30am. "OK, sweety, I'm getting up now".  I got up, found my ugghies under the bed, dragged on my robe and shuffled out to the kitchen to put the kettle on.  It was 12.55pm.  Bloody hell!!  Where was Divine Boy?  What has Divine Girl been doing all that time, alone and unsupervised?  I made a cup of tea, went and sat with Divine Girl and told her how sorry I was that I had slept half the day away and left her alone.  She was quite understanding and proceeded to show me that she had "cleaned up her room" (miraculously, unheard of, never before happening) and had been colouring, doing cut outs and playing dress ups (with my jewellery and makeup).  So, no real damage done. Then the father rang wanting to know when he would be seeing the children.  I organised to drop them off later in the afternoon because I wanted to spend some time with them when I was actually AWAKE.  Divine Boy returned home shortly after (just as I was about to send out a search team).  So the rest of the day passed by. I borrowed my brother in law's truck and went and picked up some furniture for the living room.  I have wanted to buy a particular lounge suite for some time now but have decided to wait for a while (until the children have passed out of their 'destructive stage' like in about ten years or so).  The chairs I picked up were my Dad's (and he died last year so I guess he wouldn't mind me using them) and now our living room is much cosier and guests can sit comfortably...up until yesterday they have a choice of the fold out sofa or a very large suede bean bag.  The fold out sofa makes a great 'fort' for the kids when it's folded out...but for an adult to sit on it was not so great). After the furniture moving (which I did unassisted...I am Wonder Woman) I went shopping and finally purchased the new underwear I have needed for ages.  And the makings of a very nice meal.  The children were packed up and dropped off at their father's and I raced home to shower and prepare a very nice meal for A and I.    He arrived much earlier than I expected, so no shower.  I looked really daggy but he didn't seem to mind.  He kept cuddling me and telling me I smelt really good.  WTF?  "Here's a man who hasn't had sex in over a week obviously" I thought to myself.  We cooked dinner together - cajun salmon with potatoes in butter and parsley, mushrooms and asparagus.  More vodka shots. After dinner we played chess and it was a long game which I won. More vodka shots.  We played guitar and sang loudly.  More vodka shots.  I donned my shimmy shawl (belly dancing) and performed two dances.  More vodka shots.  We were rolling around on the floor laughing and I lay on top of him to see if he could bear my weight.  He said it was a good all over body massage.  I don't think it is one I will be employing with my clients however.  Now at this stage I cannot be sure but I think there was another vodka shot.  Then stumbling to the bedroom.  Then after that it's all a bit fuzzy.  Fast forward to six in the morning and I wake up with that "Oh god no, I'm awake".  Fuzzy headed and racing to the bathroom to "drive the porcelain bus".  Made myself a cup of tea but made nothing for A because he had booked an early game of golf with one of his golfing buddies and I was a bit miffed.  Back to bed with a thumping head.  Then A got up and left to play golf.  Idiot.  He kissed me goodbye and thanked me for performing a certain act upon his person after we had come to bed.  An act which I , for the life of me, cannot remember performing.  I looked at him with one eye open and said "Yeah, whatever, now go away and let me sleep".

       urlLink Genuine  suggested I use a lighter approach to this blog re colour.&nbsp; This is the best of the templates (in my opinion) on blogspot.com &nbsp; I am new to this and I whilst I am sure there are ways to create my own template I have yet to develop the techno know how to do so. &nbsp; By nature I am a creative, artistically motivated person so I will add this to my "to do list".&nbsp; I still can't figure out how to post a picture of me to my profile.&nbsp; It keeps telling me I need a URL thingamyjig....nevertmind, I'll get there. &nbsp; I have lots of things to say about the weekend just gone here but first I am going to go and read all the blogs I love to read.&nbsp; I also need to find out how to list/link them in one of those sidebar listy type things as well.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Back real soon. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Really wintery day.  Surprisingly for winter.  Where is the sun that needs to come and shine into this greyness I have found myself sinking into?  The children are out back kicking a soccer ball around and generally enjoying each other's company.  That's because the mother has curled up into the foetal position and looks all grey and teary so there's no point in trying to involve her in anything right this minute.  Clever kids.  Last night I wrote myself a list of things that I have to do today.  Now as I peruse this list it seems as if someone else has written it.  Someone who had some hope.  Surely not the woman who sits here now feeling like this.  More tears. But I will uncurl myself and set myself to task. Something there about painting my toenails.  They look grey to me.  Red.  A bold definite no shades of grey about it red.    You know, those children out there are making some really happy noises.  Shrieks.    I dreamt again about dancing last night.  I was whirling and spinning and then next thing I lying on the floor, motionless.  I also dreamt that I was throwing handfuls of popcorn at young latin american men held in iron grey cages.  There were black musicians in my dream playing guitars and I felt such joy because they were playing one of my favourite spirituals and I was able to sing along.  Until my voice dried up and could not be heard.  I dreamt vividly of a highly polished wooden floor upon which I was dancing again.  I was wearing a long purple coat and was holding a cushion that was covered in the same soft, silky fabric.  Later the coat became red.  Don't know where that cushion ended up but I felt I needed, really needed to have it.  I was so upset that I couldn't find it.    Must take my own advice and 1.  not eat take away chinese again and 2.  stop taking the valium.  It's obviously responsible for my very colourful and stangely disturbing dreams.  I have to file my nails down.  Otherwise my next massage client will be in shreds. And whilst some may like that, most don't.  I'm considerate like that.  If you come to me for a massage I guarantee that I will not send you away torn and bleeding.  You know what got me so bent out of shape last night?  A rang, he was going to come over and see me.  I said that I wasn't feeling up to anything but am early night alone.  Then he thought he should tell me that he was seeing someone else tonight.  So there it is.  I told him that now I know that I definitely never want to be with him again. Well good luck to you A.  He asked me if I wanted to get together for lunch on Sunday.  I told him no.   Then I got so upset and felt the knife turning and turning.  All over an immature, emotionally stunted dickhead like A.  I really need to get out more.  One thing I know is that he thrives on causing emotional pain.  He prides himself on being an 'honourable person with integrity' probably because in previous relationships he has been anything but and has lost a lot because of that.  I feel sorry for the person he is seeing tonight, if she is in the for same ride that he takes everyone else on.  C sent me an email last night.  He makes me laugh.  I need to go back and read it again.  I can feel myself slowly uncurling.  The edges of the duct tape that has been wound tightly around my heart are starting to peel back. I'd even be prepared to spend a night holding J's hand.  As much as I am not a hand holder.  Anything just to break out of this weirdness.  More shrieks of delight from the children.  The doors bang as they come running in and out.  Sounds like I should go get me into that fun too.  The wind chimes out the front are...chiming...do I dare lift the blinds and blink my grey eyes out at the day?  Yep it's grey.  No surprises there.    So now it's 26/25 days to break the habit.  I don't know ..I'm losing count.  Technically I haven't had anything to do with A since last weekend so does that count?  In that case I may be at day 22.  That's good.  Deanna sent me a beautiful email of encouragement and wisdom.  It made me cry.  That's good crying.  That someone I have never met can have that much wisdom and insight and actually care enough to share it with me.  Makes me feel hopeful and not so alone.  I want 'funny silly me' to come back.  The me who says and does 'funny silly things' just for the fun of it and laughs at everyone else when they say and do 'funny silly things'.  I feel like that 'me' has been strangled.  I want to pull myself up out of this.    I want this weekend to be next weekend.  My friend G and M are coming to the city with their children and we are going to be working up at Stonyfell in the vineyard. P and S  will be there.  They are beautiful people who just have that ability to make you feel good just by being around them.   There will be much pruning of vines (that's the work part), lots of talk, lots of laughter and on Saturday night we are going to celebrate with a barbeque at P and S's house (an absolute mansion with a fantastic view of the city lights..pool and spa...the works) and drink lots of lovely wines.  That will definitely be a leave the car at home night.  On Sunday we will be back in the vineyard (hopefully not too hungover) to finish the job. I hope we get as much done on Saturday so we will not be pushed too hard on the Sunday.  G and M wondered if I wanted to bring someone else along. G wondered if A might be into it.  I just laughed and said "I don't think so".  A said he wanted to come along on Saturday night but I said I preferred not. He only wants the rewards, he would not want to put the work in. I know that would cause some resentment. Mostly mine.  Especially when he'd start banging on about "his" winemaking (mainly his father's) which tastes like crap anyways.  So, however this weekend pans out, I am so looking forward to next weekend. I want Divine Boy to be well this week.  I have so much work to catch up on!  I have several massages booked in the early part of the week and expect more calls for later bookings.    I think I will ask the father if he can have the children one night during the week so I can have dinner with C again.  See, this is me focusing on what I WHAT I WANT as opposed to WHAT I DO NOT WANT.  I'm throwing the valium out today.  If A is not around then I won't need it.  The unfurling from the foetal position is almost complete.  I'm going to take my first small step out into today.  Pray for me...lol

      Make yourself a cup of tea /coffee/ vodka and sit down here by my fireside and lets have ourselves a nice little heart to heart, hey? So, what's new with you then? Hmmm? Speak up..I can't quite catch what you are saying......  Well here's my news.  I've stopped crying.  That's good.  I really feel like a cigarette.  That's bad. I'm going to go make a cup of tea. That's neither here nor there.  Sheesh, I need to get out more. There is no more chocolate in the house.  The Toblerone went to school with the Divine ones today.  There is alcohol.  But I don't drink alone.  I've sent some emails and left some messages about tomorrow night.  Seems like everyone is out tonight doing stuff, except me.  But I have my two little people sleeping all curled up like warm puppies in their beds.  That's good.  We have left over Chinese.  Food.  Chinese food.  That's not really so good.  In fact, it's never as good as you think it's going to be.  Heard any good jokes lately?  I looked in the mirror earlier and saw one.  Me and tears. Not a good combination. I'm missing that glow.  I need to get my glow back.  Has anyone seen my freaking glow???????  A friend recently suggested a particular pastime that might bring the glow back.  I just looked at her like.....I wouldn't have sex with myself now even if I paid myself.  I'd slap my own hand away in disgust.  I want to have sex with happy people.  Not pathetic sooky la la's like I'm being now.  It would be mercy sex, and I dun do that.  Mercy sex.  Thats not good.  So here's my plan.  1.  Take the weekend with which I had planned to do not much and 2. turn it into the most fun weekend had so far.    The children are going with their Dad (who amazingly is being nice to me!) tomorrow and I am going to do something completely different and new.    I am going to dye my hair.  I am going to clean my house within an inch of it's houseness.  I am going to chill a nice sparkling chardonnay.  I am going to paint my toenails, and give my nails a french manicure. I will put on a face mask and do all the laundry. The next door neighbour will probably see me and I will be happy that he can laugh.  I won't laugh because I won't want to crack it.   I have great faith that someone will come up with a grand plan for tomorrow night. I won't be lonely.  I will laugh.  As much as I can.  There WILL be margaritas.  There will be lightness of being, and lightness in my heart.  Well, the valium I took is starting to kick in now.  I'm running low on them and I think I will not go get the next prescription filled because I'd just take them because I like how they make me feel.  That's not so good.  So, I'm going to browse my favourite blogs to see if they are out of bed yet and blogging yet.  Call me a hermit, but sometimes I feel more connected to the people I read on here than to the people I know in the outside world.  And then I hope I go to sleep.  And tomorrow will be a so much better day than tonight.  For sure.

      Ok, this is just me talking to myself. And posting it out there.  I don't want to sound whiney and sooky but I feel so pissed off now.  Angry.  Hurt.  Sick that I let myself invest so much emotion into something/someone just to have it played around with.  The person involved is not worthy of the energy I am wasting on him.  He is so screwed up.  And because I am so screwed up about love and all things connected I let myself get drawn into a never ending story with him.  I'm 41, on my own with two children and you think I'd have stopped asking this question by now!  Why would anyone want to fuck with someone else's life and emotions so much?  What can he possibly get out of it?  And why did I let myself get into it in the first place?  This is going to be the longest 27 days of my life Deanna!!!!!  I'm so hurt now and I'm crying and while I know it's not going to stay like this forever ...oh jeezus please please make it stop. My natural reaction would be to go out and have fun with a friend, or date someone new, or start something up with someone...but this time I am not going to do that. I've promised myself that the next person I trust with any part of my heart or soul is going to be worthy of it.  That I am going to know that about them before I take even the smallest of steps. And then I wonder, maybe there really isn't anyone out there that I will feel that way about and maybe it will always just be me.  And that I should be ok with that too.  What's so scarey about being alone?  Nothing.  I prefer it most times.  What's scarey then?  Being lonely.  But I've known worse.  I lived with the person I'm talking about now and he made me feel worse than I've ever felt on my own.  And I'm still letting him do it.  A word of advice (to myself, and three years too late):  If a man doesn't get along with any of his ex wives/lovers/girlfriends and even his own mother doesn't seem to like him (oh she may love him as a son but really,really doesn't like him) then let that be a warning sign.  If he has a history of deception and other unsavoury events then let that be a warning.  If his own daughters prefer not to see him if they can help it, then take heed!! If he tells you that he is different with YOU and that he knows he fucked up before and yet it won't happen with YOU..then here, I'll lend you the sneakers and you just START RUNNING NOW!!  If his oldest friend in the world can only say "that's just how he is, he'll never change" then LISTEN to that friend and do not make the mistake of thinking he just might be different with YOU.  Because he won't.  He'll just suck up all the good stuff and leave you feeling cold, empty and sad.  Right.  I got that out.  I don't know that I feel much better but I know I will.   I'm going to dress up, put on my tiara (metaphorically speaking of course) and head out  tomorrow night and have me a margarita or three and smile into those nice,  warm, friendly and smiling eyes of someone else.  Someone who isn't going to cut me to shreds emotionally.  Someone who just wants to have some fun.  (And someone who's eyes are not permanently blood shot and glassy from being high)

      DB home again.  He said he had the pain again.  He's been sneaking outside to the trampoline though this afternoon so I suspect he's feeling better. DG has come home, minus the sparkly butterflies in her hair.  Looking less like a fairy and more like a feral.  But a totally cute one.  And she won't let me take a pic of her.  Hurray it's the weekend. No Chess club tonight, no soccer tomorrow. I may not even take my pj's off till...whenever.  Already covered that we're in for a BORING time in the last post.  Been exchanging emails with C this afternoon.  It seems the mild mannered super dude may actually have a bit of a wild streak.  But as I am on a "self inflicted habit breaker no nooky curfew" for the next 28/27 days I will not be able to confirm or dispute that statement.  Ahh, mystery.  Dating isn't that much fun you know.  There's so much pressure.  Go and read this  urlLink Fishies  blog on dating and love.  She covers it so eloquently.  Love is good but the road to love, via dating and all that it entails is just so much bloody rubbish really.  I love A very much.  And I know that he loves me in his man/boy way.  We have so much fun and when it's good it's so good.  But it doesn't seem to be enough for either one of us.  He doesn't physically abuse me, he doesn't lie to me, he doesn't cheat, but...we just can't seem to work it right.  I wish we could.  My heart is still very sore.  I feel stuck.  Which is why I imposed the no nooky curfew.  Which I'll probably break. Or not....  Did I mention that I was born in the sign of Gemini?  We are having Chinese take out tonight.  It's that sort of Friday.  Chinese food might take my mind off sex.

      One thing about living in the southern hemisphere - we get to Friday just a little before most of you in the Northern hemisphere. (See&nbsp; my knowledge of things worldy just goes on and on and on and on and......)  It's Friday morning here and both DB and DG have gone to school.&nbsp; It's School photo day.&nbsp; DG's hair was&nbsp;all&nbsp;'done' - yes, it was quite a 'do'&nbsp;and she looked like a divine little fairy child.&nbsp; Or a Fleetwood Mac Groupie.&nbsp; We didn't go with curls, instead we braided and took it out this morning and fluffed it all up and pinned it with butterfly clips (sparkly ones!!)&nbsp; I really wish I'd thought to grab a picture, but I'll post the school photos when we get them.&nbsp; DG was determined to shine this year (last year was her first year at school and she didn't quite understand what was happening and so in her photo she looks like she is being lined up before a firing squad.&nbsp; DB's first school photo was the same).&nbsp; DG is an enigma to me.&nbsp; She is a totally girly girl.&nbsp; I grew up the youngest of&nbsp;five girls, and I was the tomboy (we all say that, I know, but I really was.&nbsp; My mum used to keep my hair short and I was skinny and weird looking and was often mistaken for a boy).&nbsp; So I was never&nbsp; a girly girl.&nbsp; Now that I have a daughter we do all things girly.&nbsp; We paint our nails together, style our hair, share the same taste in sparkly lip gloss and like to dress up in&nbsp;belly dancing gear and dance around the house.&nbsp; DB thinks we are weird.&nbsp; We love it.  DB spent a lengthy time in front of the mirror this morning with the hair product as well though.  Hopefully this year will yield photos that we can actually display.  DB seems to be recovering well now.&nbsp; And after a week of his illness, doctor's visits, hospital visits, sleep deprivation, cancelled massage appointments yadda yadda yadda I have decided to just take it easy today.&nbsp; I feel so tired!&nbsp; And yet at night I lie awake...   This morning the children's father arrived to take them to school!&nbsp; (Thunk.&nbsp; That was the sound of me falling over in shock.)   He handed over some money (thunk) and then advised he has paid for DB's clarinet lessons for the term. (thunk).&nbsp;&nbsp; (OUCH,&nbsp; by now it's starting to hurt a bit).   So I picked myself up off the floor and made him a coffee.&nbsp; We chatted whilst the children ran around doing that last minute stuff they do before school (as in putting stuff in their bags that they really aren't supposed to take to school but do anyways ie beanie kids, gameboys etc etc)  During the chat the ex mentioned that he felt bad about how things have been between us lately.&nbsp; Yeah right.  I informed him (yet again) that all I want is the best for the children and that I do not want to 'be at war' with anyone.&nbsp; I reminded him that I have never stopped him from seeing his children and have always encouraged the children to have good communications with him.&nbsp; I don't want to be seen as someone who is always being 'righteous'.&nbsp; So I wonder....is he finally getting "it"?&nbsp; Has he realised that when you have children you have to STEP UP TO IT.&nbsp; And just do whatever it is you have to do to be a good parent and look after these children.&nbsp; They are only with us for a relatively short time and I just want them to be able to go out into their lives and be able to deal with the world.&nbsp; To feel good about who they are and where they come from.&nbsp;   So all bodes well for the weekend.&nbsp; I have no plans, no dates, DB won't be playing soccer (at this stage I think he should have a quiet weekend) and so it it going to be RELAXING.&nbsp;   Now wait for stuff to happen to make a complete mockery of that...tee hee   It's Friday and I am lazing around.&nbsp; I'm going to the cafe soon to have a latte and read the paper and be a total lazy ass.&nbsp; Tonight we will eat take out and watch DVD's.&nbsp;   Life is Good.&nbsp; I am exhausted.&nbsp; Sleep is on the agenda.

        I got sent this in an email.&nbsp; Y'all probably seen it already but I thought I'd post it anyhoo.     &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO TO MARRY?   You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming.   Alan, age 10   No person really decides before they grow up who they're going to marry.  God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later who you're stuck with.   Kirsten, age 10   2.&nbsp; WHAT IS THE RIGHT AGE TO GET MARRIED?   Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person FOREVER by then.   Camille, age 10   No age is good to get married at. You got to be a fool to get married.   Freddie, age 6   3.&nbsp; HOW CAN A STRANGER TELL IF TWO PEOPLE ARE MARRIED?   You might have to guess, based on whether they seem to be yelling at the same kids.&nbsp;   Derrick, age 8   4.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM AND DAD HAVE IN COMMON?   Both don't want any more kids.   Lori, age 8   5.&nbsp; WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON A FIRST DATE THAT WAS TURNING SOUR?   I'd run home and play dead. The next day I would call all the newspapers and make sure they wrote about me in all the dead columns.   Craig, age 9   6.&nbsp; WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?   When they're rich.   Pam, age 7&nbsp;   (Smart kid)     The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't want to mess with that.   Curt, age 7   The rule goes like this: If you kiss someone, then you should marry them& have kids with them. It's the right thing to do.&nbsp;   Howard, age 8   7.&nbsp; IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?   It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after them.  Anita, age 9   8.&nbsp; HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT IF PEOPLE DIDN'T GET MARRIED?   There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn't there?   Kelvin, age 8   &nbsp;  9.&nbsp; HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK?   Tell your wife that she looks pretty even if she looks like a truck.   Ricky, age 10

      Divine Girl and I are going to curl her hair tonight.&nbsp; It's school photo day tomorrow.&nbsp; Divine Boy will be going to school.&nbsp;   Got my design template approved first off this morning.&nbsp; When the children are both at school tomorrow and I HAVE SOME CHILD FREE TIME!! I am going to go and buy the freakishly expensive glass and lead.&nbsp;  Spoke to A this morning.&nbsp; My intuition is correct.&nbsp; We're done.&nbsp; A very wise person has told me that it takes only thirty days to break a habit so I have twenty nine to go.&nbsp;  I have also decided not to get involved in any way, with anyone else, until the habit is broken.&nbsp;   Basically that means no nooky for a month.  GAH........................................................................................  Oh, and whilst on the subject of 'so disgusting that it's funny' (don't try to follow my logic, it's not safe), I think  urlLink Hula  takes the cake with this one.&nbsp; Go and check out her latest recipe (dated July 26).&nbsp; Unbelievably grossly funny........&nbsp; And I have been given permission to say "Only in America!!"&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Um, the photo I posted last night was my daughter.&nbsp; Divine Boy stayed in his own bed.&nbsp; He is doing much better today.&nbsp; His temp has come down and he is asking for food.&nbsp; And asking. And asking.&nbsp; I am much relieved.&nbsp; Apparently there is an illness (my sister knows the name for it..I can't pronounce it much less spell it) which is very similar to appendicitis and "mimics" it.&nbsp; Apparently her son suffered with it at around the same age.&nbsp; It's incredible, the doctors at the hospital won't tell you anything unless you specifically ask them.&nbsp; My sister is a midwife, and worked as a nurse for many years and she filled me in on what is going on with my Divine Boy.&nbsp; So, he is home today but looking and feeling much better.&nbsp; Thanks everyone for your kind words and concern.

      I finished it! My template "cartoon" (drawing for tomorrow's leadlight class).&nbsp; It is a very geometric design for a mirror frame.&nbsp;  Though I am not sure if I will be able to go tomorrow now.&nbsp; Divine Boy is still running a slight temp and is still getting the pain in his side.&nbsp; He is sleeping peacefully at the moment though.&nbsp; Divine Girl has snuck into my bed.&nbsp; Divine Boy seemed a little better this afternoon but then seemed to go downhill again tonight.&nbsp; I am feeling&nbsp;a bit drained and tired&nbsp;and it's upsetting to still have no real answers as to what is going on with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;   And I washed my hair. Woo Hoo.&nbsp; Hate the shampoo I'm using at the moment though.&nbsp; The children seemed to have discovered that they love washing their hair and our shampoo consumption seems to have tripled in the last few weeks.&nbsp; I am so going to go and buy myself some really nice stuff&nbsp; (I always used to until recent months when there seems to be little or no "me" money) and hide it in the bathroom.  I'm tired and yet I'm awake.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; There is an old Katherine Hepburn movie on the tv.&nbsp; Perhaps I'll fall asleep watching it.  I can hear the Toblerone chocolate in the kitchen calling me but I'm ignoring it.&nbsp; Sort of.  And I am still heartsore about A.&nbsp; Feeling let down all over again.&nbsp; It is a cycle.&nbsp; And I'm determined to break it.&nbsp; For myself.&nbsp; I really hope he gets involved with&nbsp;someone else soon and stops screwing me around.&nbsp;   Gah, don't listen to me.&nbsp; I'm just rambling on now....*yawns*

      I just sent a certain person an email.&nbsp; Which, bluntly put, explains that I AM NO longer going to deal with&nbsp;anymore of&nbsp;his bad manners and out of control ego bouts and that I AM looking forward to being with someone, in every sense of the word, who ISN'T HIM.  It's a big step to take, ya know.&nbsp; Because after three years of put downs, lying crap and various other forms of emotional abuse, I just don't know that I am ready or brave enough to&nbsp;take that step.&nbsp; But I really want to. I guess it's a bit like jumping off a bridge with a long stretchy rope tied to your ankle. Actually,&nbsp; it's probably a lot easier than that. And if we can dim the lighting , well, it should get even easier.  As to who the lucky recipient of my love, bubbly company &nbsp;and world famous sexual favours &nbsp;will be?................ well that's gonna remain in the vault.  For now.

      Divine Boy is still on the sick list. I took him to the hospital, where after three hours of waiting and blood tests and examinations they have sent him home.&nbsp; He either has a virus or the beginnings of appendicitis. Poor little guy.&nbsp; So it looks like another day off school tomorrow.   And it's still freezing cold here.   And A is being really unfriendly again.   Yep, all is normal.   I left a message for A on his cell phone saying that I have had enough of this treatment.&nbsp; I'm sure that will afford him great satisfaction to know that I am feeling left out in the cold again.   This weekend is going to be pretty busy.&nbsp; I have to fit out our spare room because it looks like we will be having an overseas student coming to stay for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to go out and organise some furniture for the room and clean it out.&nbsp; (It's amazing how we can spread our shit around this house!)   Leadlighting class tomorrow morning.&nbsp; I still have to draw up my template.&nbsp; I got all the stuff for it this morning and I am waiting for the children to go to bed so I can get started on it.   But first&nbsp; I need to go and wash my hair.&nbsp; In fact, I think I am going to take a long hot bath with a glass of wine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time for ME.   At the hospital today the doctor was&nbsp;young and gorgeous.&nbsp; I felt like a pile of dooky, with unwashed hair, and wearing my most daggy clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's always the way!!   Well, it's Wednesday night and I have no date organised for Saturday!&nbsp; J rang last night but didn't actually ask me to do anything specific.&nbsp; After the handholding incident (previous post somewhere about this) I wasn't sure I wanted to pursue anything there.&nbsp; But as my good friend pointed out to me , it was really a compliment and he was letting me know that he likes me.&nbsp; I guess I'll keep an open mind.&nbsp; But no Saturday night date for him.&nbsp; That's the rule.&nbsp; If you want to to see me&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;night, then you have to plan it by Wednesday.&nbsp; C has emailed but hasn't put forward an idea.&nbsp; As for A, well he's off the list for good now.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; This time I mean it.   I think it's time for a good old Girls Night Out.&nbsp; Tiaras and Cocktails.&nbsp; And no boys.&nbsp; Boys are smelly and they spoil your fun.   Have to go tuck the children in and kiss them three thousand times each.   &nbsp;

      Divine Ones are both asleep.&nbsp; Divine Boy's temperature has come down slightly.&nbsp; I hope he's over the hump of this bout of sickness.&nbsp; I feel drained.&nbsp; But not sleepy. I am not sending him to school tomorrow.&nbsp; It's heart breaking to see your beloved child with a pale face, dark rings under tired little eyes and when the pain in his stomach hits he looks really distressed.&nbsp; I feel so useless and helpless.&nbsp; I just held him and rubbed his back.&nbsp; He has been asleep for a couple of hours now. Now I just have to pray that Divine Girl doesn't come down with it too.&nbsp;  Boy do we need a vacation!&nbsp; (we just had one!!) .&nbsp; But this time we need to go somewhere warm and sunny.&nbsp; I have a friend who has a place in Port Douglas in Queensland.&nbsp; I wonder if I made a wish if we could afford airline tickets up there for a week soon.&nbsp; Oooh, imagine what Divine Boy's teacher would do then!!&nbsp; Have an aneurism probably. Heh.

      Divine Boy is not feeling well. We have been to Doctor D and it seems like he has a stomach flu/virus.&nbsp;&nbsp; But appendicitis has not been completely ruled out.&nbsp; Poor little guy really isn't a happy camper. He's got a prescription however the drama that accompanies pill swallowing.....I fully expect to see and hear him giving an Oscar acceptance speech sometime in the next twenty years or so....So it looks like he will be home again tomorrow. If the pain keeps up tonight I think we may be in for one of those FUN late night visits to the hospital. Oh hang on, the doctor gave me his cell phone number. Tee Hee. Silly Doctor D!! The father picked up Divine Girl from school and has taken her to Scouts tonight. I almost wonder if I should request he keep her with him in case we do have to go out later. Don't mind me, I'm just thinking out loud here, via my fingers. I have the laptop in the bed with me and the sick boy next to me. If he could just go to sleep it might settle down a bit.&nbsp; I feel tired.&nbsp; I'm thinking that if we have to go we should go now.&nbsp; Divine Boy is reluctant.&nbsp; I am unsure.&nbsp; Not&nbsp; a state of mind that I like.&nbsp;

       urlLink Monica  just commented that there was something funky going on with this blog.&nbsp; For a moment I thought that meant a GOOD thing.&nbsp; But no, it seems that she had to scroll halfway down the screen before anything appeared.&nbsp; Please let this NOT be because I have been fooling around in the template. (Like letting a kid loose in a glassware shop).&nbsp; Please let it be a momentary glitch that will have sorted itself out.&nbsp; When I view it on my screen, it looks as usual.&nbsp; You know, kinda long winded and repetitive and, well, Boring....So dear reader/s...please let me know if there is anything funky going on with this blog at your end...And no, this is not another pathetic cry for attention...

      It's brass monkey weather here.&nbsp; Chilly and grey.&nbsp; Divine Boy stayed home from school today as he is still not quite right.&nbsp; When I dropped Divine Girl off at school I went to his classroom to collect some books and homeschooling stuff for him to do.&nbsp; Mrs ON YOUR FREAKIN BACK gave me the third degree about his illness.&nbsp; I stood my ground and kept a mantra in my head "Only two more terms of this beeatch".&nbsp; I gently reminded her that he is my son, has lived with me for nearly ten years now and that I, as his mother, was the one who made the decisions about his attendance/absence at school.&nbsp; And I stopped just short of telling her to go and get her freaking roots done.&nbsp; Sheesh lady, if you are going to have your hair dyed blonde then at least maintain it.  Otherwise it just looks shabby.&nbsp; Crappy.&nbsp; And something about pink crushed velvet sleeveless vests worn over black sweaters....ewwwwwww   So I took Divine Boy with me to Pottery Class. (Gee, it makes me feel positively menopausal to admit that I go to Pottery Class).&nbsp; He amused himself making models of feet.&nbsp; M'kay.&nbsp; I'm cool with that... I am doing quite well in the bowl making department.&nbsp; Everyone will get handmade bowls (salad/pasta/soup/rice/crap that you find on the floor type bowls) for Christmas this year.   One of the other class members booked a massage for after class next week.&nbsp; And then so did her two friends.&nbsp; I think it's a little bit of the "keeping up with the Jones's".&nbsp; Hey, I am not complaining.&nbsp; It's all money in the bank to me.   After class I had to go to the hardware store.&nbsp; I need to get a mirror tile - Leadlighting class on Thursday and I am making a frame.&nbsp; But the hardware store where I remember seeing the mirror tiles about a year ago no longer stock them.&nbsp; Bugger.&nbsp; So home we came and I let my fingers do the walking in the yellow pages.&nbsp; After the massage I have booked tomorrow I have to go hunting around town to get the materials I need.&nbsp; Divine Boy will need to be ok for school.&nbsp; Much as I love his company I am dying to get some time to myself.   It feels like this week is going to go on forever.&nbsp; It is only Tuesday afternoon!!&nbsp;   No bloody idea what to cook for dinner tonight.&nbsp; *Yawns*  My back feels heaps better today.&nbsp; Two days pain killer free and I am starting to look normal again.&nbsp; My behaviour has improved somewhat as well...  A didn't come round last night so I didn't get me some of that.....  TMI anyone????  Oh and that six pack of toblerone?&nbsp; Well it's now a four pack.....Oh ok then, a three pack.   Divine Boy is complaining of stomach pain again.&nbsp; I'm a bit worried.&nbsp; It is so hard to get an appointment with the Doctor that we normally see these days.&nbsp; I'm wondering if I should take him to the hospital later.&nbsp; I better get off this time sucking machine and make some calls I think.   Later Dudes.

      So, anyways I put a hit counter on this site last week.&nbsp; Since then there have been a few hits.&nbsp; Probably most of them mine.&nbsp; But it would seem that people come and lurk and then shuffle off.&nbsp; Please leave me a comment, even if it's to say that you have nothing to say about the fact that I obviously have nothing&nbsp; to say.&nbsp; It's the thought that counts.....Anyhoo, Goodnight from me.&nbsp; Think of me having to wake up when you are getting ready to go to bed.

      I have been site visiting again, finding new and interesting places.&nbsp; First off I went to  urlLink Shemboy &nbsp;.&nbsp; This young man has survived a horrific&nbsp;car accident&nbsp;and lost one of his very close friends.&nbsp; His site is about his experiences and his recovery.&nbsp; A very interesting, thought&nbsp;provoking, insightful and humourous read.&nbsp; Go there and send him your encouragement and best wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;(And check out his pics....he is a total cutie!!)  Then onto  urlLink Moodstruck  ..... if you need tomatoes (or tequila) it would appear that she's the one to see...another entertaining read.....  ...this led me to  urlLink Jenny's Deep Thoughts..Or not &nbsp; - definitely a blog name I can relate to....  and then randomly to  urlLink Blondie ...where the first thing that caught my eye was "herniated disc".&nbsp; This is what is wrong with my back and I can only sypmathise with her because I know how disruptive and painful this condition can be (refer to the endless whines in my posts about pain)  And then, just to round off the five, I came across  urlLink My Single Mom Life ...well, no surprises why that one would catch my eye....but once again some pretty amazing similarities and conincidences.....and I know that in this universe NOTHING happens by conincidence!!  Now, if I only knew what TRACKBACK was....and how to use it....I'd follow  urlLink Genuine's  advice and do it.&nbsp; But I'm stoopid bout stuff like that.&nbsp; And it's 1.26am....Bugger!

HERE IS MY CHALLENGE.  SHALL I LEAVE IT THERE AND TORTURE MYSELF? SHALL I MAKE MYSELF LOOK AT MY BUTT IN THE MIRROR EACH TIME I THINK OF HAVING SOME? SHALL I GIVE IT AWAY TO THE MAN I LOVE? (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE HON)  I can't reveal it's existence to the children....not at this time of night, they'd be&nbsp;bouncing off the walls.&nbsp; I know...I'll sneak some into their lunch boxes tomorrow as a surprise.&nbsp; Break the school rule of NO CHOCOLATE.&nbsp; Tee Hee......

      Dinner cooked.  I can hide five different types of vegetable in bolognese sauce if I chop them small enough.&nbsp; Dishes washed. (Those who know me know this is the one chore I am least likely to want to do)Desert baked and served.&nbsp;  Leftovers packed up for school lunches tomorrow.&nbsp; Laundry ready to be put through.   Big Boring Brother 4 Finale is on tonight.&nbsp; I have not voted once.&nbsp; The one I thought deserved the million was evicted last night.&nbsp; So I don't care who gets it now.&nbsp; Just so long as it isn't Bree.&nbsp; She behaved like a total beeatch for most of the series.&nbsp; Trevor, well he's kinda funny but kinda boring...if anyone should get a million bucks for sitting around on their big old behind on a bean bag and occasionally scaring people, well it's ME.   Once I'm done with NOT watching the final show in tv, I am going to set the ironing board up and see if I can remove the pink candlewax from my favourite white hooded top.&nbsp; (Last Wednesday's dinner I spilt candle wax on my sleeve when moving the candelabra)  This will be the first time the iron has been switched on in ....months.....   I am not a domestic Goddess.&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be no confusion where that's concerned.   But I am Uber Mama.&nbsp; Just ask my kids.

      I like dogs.&nbsp; I fully intend to get a dog for the children (and me).&nbsp; But I had been thinking that we could go to the Lost Dog Home and rescue a doggy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Puppies are sweet and cute and all but you have to invest so much time into them.&nbsp; I sort of thought we could get a dog that's been abandoned and just wants a second chance at being part of a family.&nbsp; I thought we would do that when we have found the new house.

      Divine Girl has invited Amy J for a play date after school on Thursday.&nbsp; This information was related to me, very seriously, because it is the equivalent of&nbsp;a Royal Visit to have Amy J come to your house.   Now, we have swings, a trampoline, the most haute couture dress up box you could imagine (as in the clothes I cant fit my fat a** into anymore which is pretty much most of my wardrobe), 3,499 Barbies with assorted outfits and various electronic sources of entertainment.&nbsp; We even have a playroom that can be converted to a disco.&nbsp; (pull the blind down and turn the mirror ball on).&nbsp; I put on a sumptuous feast (ok, cookies and fizzy drink).&nbsp; All should be good, yes?   Well apparently NOT.&nbsp; The most&nbsp;IMPORTANT ingredient WE DO NOT HAVE.   A puppy.   Amy J has a puppy.&nbsp; (Why not go to HER house then?)&nbsp; Amy J has THE most beautiful puppy ever.   We have a cat, but he won't comply and behave in a suitably puppy like fashion.&nbsp; Useless bloody cat.&nbsp; Hair ball producing, heat sucking eating machine.  I am expected to procure a puppy by Thursday.   And you know what?&nbsp; I'm seriously thinking of it. Cos I'm a sucker like that.&nbsp; And it might put to rest these clucky maternal stirrings I am feeling everytime I see or hear about a baby.   But then I think of the vet's bills, the peeing and the pooping on the carpet and all associated things to do with having a puppy, which won't stay a puppy but will grow into a dog which will bark a lot, annoy me constantly and leave hair.&nbsp; Everywhere.&nbsp; Which will be really good for my allergies.   Anyone got a puppy I can rent?????

      The school rang at midday.&nbsp; Divine Boy needed to come home.&nbsp; He's not well.&nbsp; Oh summer, please hurry up!&nbsp; He looked like me with a hangover.&nbsp; And no, dear reader, he was not at the vodka last night.&nbsp; I asked him.   So Mrs On Your Freakin' Back&nbsp; (teacher) obviously considered him not well enough to endure her daily regime.&nbsp; My god, the woman may possibly be warm blooded after all!   I think he's picked up a flu virus.&nbsp; So I tucked him up in my bed (that's a REAL treat for him) dosed him up with Children's Panadol and suggested he try to sleep.   Luckily  I  woke up in time to collect Divine Girl from school!!!   It rained and rained last night.&nbsp; Today is just cold and grey. All the work I needed to get done this afternoon is still there.&nbsp; No suprises there.&nbsp; I won't feel like sleeping tonight anyhoo.  Spaghetti Bolognese for dinner tonight.   Oh and anyone who wants to buy the movie rights to this blog, just form an orderly queue to the left, please.   &nbsp;   Is there anything weird about this?     &nbsp;  I dreamt that Judge Judy came to my (childhood)&nbsp;house.&nbsp; I was working on a computer (which was&nbsp;circular in shape...like they always are in dreams)&nbsp;and I couldn't make it do what I needed it&nbsp;to. Because Judge Judy kept watching over my shoulder and I kept making typo errors.  Meanwhile, a small blonde child was running around the house (which was the house I grew up in as a child) and scribbling all over the walls and floors in texta ink.&nbsp; I was torn between stopping this child from committing any further vandalism and bringing up the programme on the circular computer. It was some type of accounting programme. And I was frustrated because I knew that I could do it, it just wasn't happening.   Now my question is this:&nbsp; Should I give up the pain killers or the afternoon naps?   &nbsp;

      It's no secret...I love silver.&nbsp; I love my silver bangles, bracelets, ear rings etc etc.&nbsp; A while ago, my favourite solid round silver bangle disappeared.&nbsp; It's been gone for months.&nbsp; I turned my room, the kids rooms upside down looking for it.&nbsp; I went through every cupboard, toybox, looked under every sofa cushion.&nbsp; Eventually I gave up.&nbsp; I figured it must have fallen off my wrist or that somehow it had been lifted...   On Saturday I was packing Divine Girl's overnight bag for her sleepover. I couldn't find her overnight bag so I grabbed her old pink kindergarten backpack from the cupboard in the laundry.&nbsp; When I opened it...hey presto!!&nbsp;&nbsp; There was my silver bangle.&nbsp; Oh Happy Day!!   It's always the last place you look.   Divine Girl was much relieved when she received a great big joyous hug from me...I as so happy to have it back to worry about her putting it in there and forgetting about it.&nbsp; That's just what kids do, right?   That was a good thing that happened on the weekend.

      Woo Hoo...Our Prime Minister has turned 65 today.   He still hasn't made any declaration or commitment to fulfilling the next three years as PM if he is voted in again which means that we may end up in eighteen months or so with the Treasurer Mr Peter Costello as the PM.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; Not.   I wonder if the people who are going to vote Liberal&nbsp;have considered that.   &nbsp;

      Friday night: slept the sleep induced by kick ass pain killers.  Saturday:&nbsp; Up at sparrow's fart to deliver Divine Boy to Stupid O Clock soccer game.  Whilst there managed to piss other parent of Divine Boy right off...amazing what a few truthful words can do....so if we are going down "Let's Be Stupid About This Street" again well all's I can say is Yay Me.  Saturday afternoon I was visited by a friend (who has the same name as me!) with her daughter - we haven't caught up in a long while and it was good to talk.&nbsp; She is a very good counsellor who never pushes and I felt much better in myself after talking to her for a while.  She took Divine Girl with her for a sleep over (our daughters are the same age) which was really nice of her.  A came over and I was terrible company.&nbsp; My back pain has been making me really irritable and I have deserved the title Total Bitch.&nbsp; (And not in a good way).  The father of the children rang at 6.30pm wanting to know if the children were spending any time with him...apparently his dialling finger was out of action until that time).&nbsp; I let Divine Boy decide.&nbsp; He wanted to see his Dad so that was all good.  A and I spent the night in, ordered pizza and watched tv.&nbsp; We went to bed really early and I fell asleep.&nbsp; All was good until later, when I totally freaked out because he woke me up.&nbsp; Once again, it wasn't me...it was the pain killers talking....  Sunday morning....we slept till eleven!!&nbsp; Then we lazed around, went out for coffee and to read the Sunday papers came home, went back to bed...then A left and I got up and did the dishes and did the laundry!!&nbsp; Then I went for a drive up into the hills to collect Divine Girl and when we came home the father dropped Divine Boy off.&nbsp; We had a light dinner and then all hopped into my bed and watched some tv.&nbsp; We watched Big Brother 4 and my favourite housemate (Paul) was evicted, just 24 hours short of the million dollars....that sucks...so we all went to sleep really early.&nbsp;  Isn't my life just so totally exciting????

      Dear Mrs Get on My Eldest's Back Every Freakin Chance You Get,   Divine Boy was not on school on Friday because I was having a really hard time getting moving and co-ordinating my feet on the clutch and the brake pedal, not even mentioning the accelerator&nbsp; was just too much for me.   I'm so so so so so sorry that my son has lost one whole day in which you can impart your extremely valuable wisdom and knowledge to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, like last week when you all sat down and calculated just how many minutes a day you spend teaching them.   (Of course, I so totally understand that you may already have called in Child Welfare Services.&nbsp; Please ask them to wipe their feet on the mat on the front door, which I will have left open for them seeing as how I can't move much right now.)&nbsp;   Today's good news however, is Divine Boy is at school today.&nbsp; (Please note that he hardly ever misses a day).&nbsp; He was Totally Stressing Out in the car on the way to school.&nbsp; Apparently he needs a note from me if he gets to school late.&nbsp; (which we weren't..it took me a while to convince him that the clock in the car is running seven minutes fast).&nbsp; If I have to write a note why he's a few minutes late, then he'll be later, won't he??   He isn't enjoying this year much with you at all.&nbsp; But I have explained to him that not every teacher is going to be as good as&nbsp;others he has had so far and that I still expect him to do his best and to be respectful and polite.&nbsp;   I wish you'd lighten up a bit.&nbsp; It's hard enough to keep his self esteem on a good level without you dumping your disapproving shit on him every day.   He is doing well in his work, he reads way beyond his age level, he's smart.&nbsp; He's sensitive.&nbsp; Back off.&nbsp; Bitch.   From Divine Boy's Cranky Mother

      I'm on my own here.  The only comfortable place is flat on my stomach.  And I'm hungry.  That's a good sign.  Only problem is I haven't been shopping and there's no food in the house.  So, maybe my body will start using up all the reserves of fat I have stored around my butt and hips.  Yay.  Still hungry though.....

      I'm not sure...it could be an after effect of the pain killers...but I just saw Ashlee Simpson's video/song "Pieces of me" and I liked it!?   What do you think I should do?????   I think the whole Rock chic thing has more appeal that her totally plastic and dopey sister. Mind you, I don't think watching "Newlyweds" helped to endear Jessica to me at all.

      The children aren't here.  They are with their father tonight.  They went there last night.  My lower back condition has been flaring up lately.  Yesterday as I got into the car I must have twisted my spine a little, and the lip of the disc that bulges out has become inflamed and is pressing on my sciatic nerve.  Too much information for ya?  I was picking up the children from school so it was around 3.30pm.  Halfway home my whole lower back and left leg went into muscle spasm.  It hurt a great deal.  It also meant that I could not drive any further. Fortunately we do not live far away from school, so once the car was parked and locked we were able to walk home, about a fifteen minute walk.  The thing about this back/spine thingy is that I can move around with it.  Walking is a little more tiring and a tad uncomfortable but it's "do-able" So here comes the interesting part.  Sitting down was impossible.  Lying down, there was just no way I could find a position that wasn't just unbearable after a moment or two.  So I was up and moving.  Controlling my breathing.  And the pain was starting to increase.  I took some pain killers and saw the children off.  And then I just sort of kept walking around until 2am.  I was so tired, and if it was possible to fall asleep standing up, I would have.  I called my doctor's after hours service and a 'locum' doctor was sent out.  He was wonderful.  I usually hate needles/shots of any kind but he gave me one in the butt that stung...ouchies..but fifteen minutes later I was in bed and out like a light.  Having spent ten hours on my feet and moving Thursday afternoon and evening, Friday I spent most of the day asleep.  Aided by pain killers. Kick ass pain killers.  The conclusion of this very long winded post is that it is now Saturday morning and I still have some back pain and one dead leg.  My left leg is numb to touch and my foot is really weak.  So I'm walking kinda funny like.  But I'm walking.  DB has come home this morning and gone off to soccer with one of his team mates (who lives two doors down the road).  DG is with her father (DB reports that she has been very naughty at Dad's house and has been getting into trouble quite a bit).  I am not allowed to drive at the moment (I couldn't anyway, my car is a manual gear change and I can't use my left foot on the clutch).  A came over last night and made me an omelette. He is a very good cook and very caring and supportive at times like this.   This is not the time to talk about any kind of future developments while I am under the influence pain and pain control.  The good thing about this is that all the walking I did, and now all the walking I will have to do to get the strength back into my left leg (the loss of sensation and the foot weakness may last for several weeks) means that I will lose weight.  I have had this condition for the last twelve years or so and have refused any surgical intervention all this time (my eldest sister had the same, had the surgery and now has a morphine pump installed under her skin....ewwwwww)  So I have to lose weight, start working out to strengthen my muscles to support my lower back better....every cloud has a silver lining.

      He drives me crazy.  He makes me laugh.  He holds me. He hurts my feelings. He tells me he loves me. He makes me feel so sad sometimes.  He sends me funny messages.  He drives by my house just to see that I'm ok. He drives past my house to see if anyone is there. (I'd do the same, but he's living with his parents right now) We argue.  We storm out on each other.  I couldn't take anymore.  I "cut myself loose" and I moved on.  He went dancing with someone else.  By Sunday he was at my place telling me he didn't want to be with anyone else, that he wanted to make things work with me. I know that I would be ok without him.  He'd be ok without me too.  And I want him in my life. As much as I don't.    We lived together for four months until he moved out earlier this year.  We both have children and there was so much going on - court hearings for custody (on his side), difficult relations between parents and then the children having to make space for each other.  It wasn't bad, the children were always top priority - it just came with a unique set of challenges which we were not prepared for.  My closest friends and family have told me to move on and forget about him.  His family and friends have told him the same thing, I'm sure.  And we are still drawn to each other.  There is no physical violence.  But the pain we can cause each other emotionally is devastating.  And when it's good, it's wonderful. And I'm not talking about sex.  The emotional closeness, the friendship, the support for each other.  That is what is so good about it.  So here it is.  I know I can walk away.  I am prepared to do so.  I don't want to be with him because I am afraid of being without him.  I know what it is to be without him and I can live with it.    We have a choice. We can try to make it work or we can walk away now.  In any case, if it doesn't work, I know it will not kill me, because I have already survived it.  So it's a risk.    This is not a decision I can make quickly. And I know he knows this too.

      Discovered this Thursday Threesome thingy at  urlLink this new (to me) site:       Onesome- Knit one: Do you have a crafty hobby? Knitting, stitching, scrapbooking or model building, whatever it is, tell us about it! Or is there a crafty hobby you'd like to take up if had the time and/or money to do so?     Yes.  I am artistic and creative.  I am a 'potter' (I make things out of clay) and on Thursday's I do leadlighting.  I am currently working on a mirror frame, which will be placed on a stand and in front of a window.  I love colour and want as much as I can light-reflected around me.      Twosome- Purl: Or rather, pearl. What's your birthstone? And while you're at it, what's your sign?     My birthstone is emerald.  My sun sign is Gemini, but I have Scorpio rising and therefore am now, in my more mature years (pfftt..) exhibiting strong Scorpio characteristics.  Also, I look like  a Scorpio.  I have a Virgo moon which makes me compulsive obsessive about some things (ie attention to detail in pottery and leadlighting) and there is quite a bit of Taurus in my chart which makes the man who says he loves me say I'm crazy.  (He's Taurus too...go figure)     Threesome- Too: Too much? Have you had enough of the political coverage already? ...or are you waiting for things to really gear up in the Fall?     I've had too much of the political coverage - of both the govt of the United States and the govt of Australia.  Admittedly this time around perhaps I am paying a little more attention because of world events of late...but enough already....

      It's Humpday and I'm struggling with it all here.  Divine Children were sent to at 7.30 instead of 8.30pm last night.  They still are not really "getting it".  There was more of the same so I have told them that tonight they are going to bed at 7.30 again.  I just need to get some controls back into place here.  I'm outnumbered two to one!!  It's the little things like when I say "Please bring your schoolbag in from the car when we get home".  They just disregard me...it's as though I talk just for the sake of hearing my own voice....(oh lordy, I'm channeling MY mother here!!lol) The other thing I did this morning is introduced them to Mr Dishcloth.  They are going to become well acquainted with Mr Dishcloth tonight (and every night from now on).  They are old enough to dry the dishes and put them away.  DB did say "Mum, I'm going to clean my room this afternoon when I get home".  Well Good.  But that is not going to make the tv come back on.  I don't know if he knows this yet or not.  Meanwhile here I am humming and hawing about starting my glass cutting for my leadlight project.  I have to go out THERE...OUT THERE it is rainy and cold and it's really kind of dodgy on the roads.  I have to do it though.  It has to be done by tomorrow morning.  I'm boring myself now.

      It has been raining for three days and nights.  It's making me cranky. I'm tired of this cold weather.  And if one more child comes near me with a complaint about another child well...something will have to give.  My head will explode.  I have sent them to bed half an hour earlier tonight.  They really did go a little too far last night.  Maybe that's because I've been going a little too easy of late. Mean Mommy.  Well, that's all I have to say for now.  I have to go and make muffins with mini M&M's in them for play lunch tomorrow.  Oh and bread. I have to make bread.  (This means I have to put the stuff in the bread maker and push the ON button.)  I don't really have the energy to do it.  I gave a massage today at a house where they obviously don't believe in heating.  It was so cold.  Normally I break a sweat when I work. Not in this place.  It was positively arctic.  All I wanted to do when I got home was jump under my quilt and have an afternoon nap.  And I was so hungry too!!  I have an appointment tomorrow and I have to get the glass cut for my leadlight mirror frame I am making.  I have to have it done by Thursday morning.  I just seem to be time poor at the moment.  Well, that was fascinating, huh.

      Last night the Divine Boy and Girl were more Naughty than Divine.  They would not be quiet when it was time for them to go to sleep.  I warned them.  I said "If I have to come in one more time and tell you to settle down you will lose ALL privileges for a week!".  As I walked down the hallway back to the living room I heard a little voice call out "I don't care!".  "Well that's good" I called back "because you've just lost them".  (While this may seem unfair, can I just point out that they have both been 'pushing the envelope' for a couple of days and have both received more than one warning)  It has been raining all night last night and today.  I was running a little late (as in five minutes) to pick them up from school.  They had been waiting in the rain.  (There is a porch verandah at the front of the school they could shelter under but today it was obvious the Daddy's Genes Take The Lead Day.  So they were a tad damp and smelt like wet puppies as they climbed into the car.  "Hot showers for ya both when we get in" I suggested.  "No!  Kid's programmes!" they chorused in unison.  They got 'the look'. "I haven't forgotten about last night you know!" I pointed out. They both just shrugged.  When they got in the door the televisions are all there as usual.  Funny thing though, the antennas have all disappeared.  So no tv.  And no game boys.  No PS2.  No DVD's.  Less than Divine Boy is ranting and raving at me at the moment.  Boy, that kid has alpha male syndrome.  He thinks because he is the only male in the house he is THE MAN of the house.  Sometimes I'm tempted to repartner just to show him...lol....Only kidding.  I AM STILL THE HEAD OF THIS HOUSEHOLD.  La La LA LA LA LA LA LA LA  ....I'm not listening.  He is working himself into quite a frenzy.  (Divine Girl has decided to go take a hot shower.  Smart kid.)  Maybe next time they'll know that I mean business.

      There's this woman, who has a wild child living inside her.  In her younger years this woman's life was that of the wild child - she was wild, spirited, fiery and lived each day like it was her last.   Then life, time, love, and the loss of it, calmed her down.  Further and further down.  She became someone who took care of her responsibilities and made sensible choices.  Safe choices.  Decisions were made on a daily basis that involved putting everyone else first.  The woman was quite happy about this.  But inside, that 'wild child' exists still.  She is sitting, swinging her legs impatiently and twisting her unruly hair into dreadlocks.  One night the woman opened herself up, and out came the dancing wild child with her blazing eyes and unruly hair.  She danced barefoot under the full blue moon and infected all around her with her fiery spirit.  She drank from the fruit of the vine and tasted the forbidden fruit.    Next day, when the sun came up, the woman awoke.  Wild Child was back on the inside, smiling to herself as she curled up and lay quietly.  When the woman looked into the mirror, she saw that her hair was unruly and dreadlocked and that her eyes were blazing.  She left it just like that.  And now she dances.  Everywhere she goes. And she lives every day of her life loving as though she has never lost love before.

      Two people go out on a dancing date. They share with each other that they both have "someone in their lives" - and they feel both  their  heads are being messed with. (Insert sound of plaintiff violin here). They dance, have fun and then (according to one party) went home to their respective beds without so much as a goodnight kiss. (Gee, guess which gender related this side of the tale!!) Just over twenty four hours later the female of this couple is texting the other asking "Are you free on Friday?". The male of this couple, receiving this text message is in a quandary now, because he has told "the someone" in his life about this. What does he do? Welcome to the"Oops, That Was a Slip of The Tongue Show".  Ed:  The person in the quandary IS free on Friday.  No doubt he WILL pursue the sender of the text message.  Watch this space to see the 'someone' in his life sit back and chuckle quietly to herself as he spins his story, ' explaining' himself and 'explaining' why it is  HER  fault that this has all come about.

      What a day! After very little work last week because Divine Boy (DB) was home and not well I had to get back into the swing of things...and my arms and hands are exhausted! But I'm still here typing away at 12.50am!  Two massages of approximately one and a quarter hours and then a 9.00pm booking who I massaged until well past 10.30 - that was the full works: lower back, upper back, shoulders, neck, head, legs, feet...and it was for a friend so the time went quickly - chatting for a while and then just massaging in comfortable silence.  I love what I do. At the beginning of each massage I make sure the room is warm and I always burn some candles in the fireplace and have light aromatherapy oils which lightly scent the air but do not overpower. I have a cd which is a compilation of native american dances/songs and I love listening to this as I massage. It serves two purposes - firstly I know it is as long as the massage needs to last (no ticking timer or annoying buzzer that goes off and startles the client) and it gets me into the 'zone'. The phone is taken off the hook, the doorbell is turned off, the cell phone is turned off and sometimes I forget where I am. It's like a light trance state, whereby your hands are communicating. It's an instinctive thing. I am well practised in technique and yet I just follow where I find my hands taking me. The music lulls the client into a more relaxed state and then I can feel where the muscle is knotted tight and cramped and I just work on it to release the tension. Often I feel my own muscles working hard and I tend to sweat - so it's a good workout for me. Most massages leave me feeling very energised and relaxed at the same time and I know that this is a part of what the client feels. I have a couple of clients who can make me feel quite drained. I know when that happens that it is because I am not 'channeling' good energy. Some clients are quite surprised that they can find themselves feeling quite emotional. But the body is where we store the emotions that we don't communicate. (Which is why I believe blogging is a very therapeutic thing also). And of course, massaging an area where an emotion has been stored gets it moving. I often find myself telling clients not to be ashamed if they feel like crying..it's not uncommon and it is a good release. I never push them to talk about what is going on with them but if they feel the need to communicate it, I will listen. I have learnt that we all have similar insecurities, fears and anxieties. Even people who look like they have it all completely 'together' on the outside can be carrying a lot of pain on the inside.  Oh, and in case you are wondering, no, I don't perform sexual massage. (Well, I do, but not with the clients. Only ever with a lover/special friend).  I use organic oils - almond and apricot kernel oil blends are my favourite. The only thing is there is a lot of laundry generated (sheets on the massage table and towels etc). But you factor that into the cost. I am not as expensive as some people I know in the industry but that is because I believe that I will only charge top dollar when I know I have really mastered the art of massage. And that means lots of practise.  I guess this is one of the reasons I don't go to the gym. The more work I do, the more muscle I develop. (When my hair goes completely grey I shall put it in a bun and call myself Olga and dress in a white nurse's uniform and be really scarey and hurt people...tee hee) Tomorrow I have pottery first thing and then two massages booked straight after. This means taking a change of clothes with me as well as the table etc etc. I really prefer clients to come to me but as these two live just around the corner from the studio I am quite happy to go to them.  So there is a rundown on what I do. I am determined to get as much work as I can over the next few months. Most of my clients are referred to me by their friends/family etc so it's good that I don't have to factor in advertising expenses. But I think next year I will branch out and find a studio I can set up myself somewhere. Now if I can just add an extra day to each week I can do this and set up the leadlight business with my sister.  That's a whole 'nuther post. How to work with glass and not cut your hands so you can massage. (I think I'd prefer to see a masseur whose hands were not plastered with bandaids. And I don't want people's germs either!!)  So anytime you need to loosen up and get those knots out of your neck just give me a call!!

      What a funny weekend it turned out to be.  Today has been filled with massage appointments - I have one booked for 9.00pm (any minute now) so I can catch up on the missed work of last week.  DB is well and Divine children have just gone to bed without any complaints.  So all is good.  So, as soon as I have a minute or two spare I will log on here and bore you all stupid with every little detail of my weird weekend.  There was a full moon on Saturday night, also referred to as The Blue Moon as it is the second full moon of the months...I personally hold it repsonsible for a lot of strange things that went down on the weekend...tee hee...

      You're driving down a main road, heading into the city and pull up at a red light.  You look into the car next to you.  You see that the adult in the front passenger seat is holding a baby of about eight or nine months of age on their lap. A beautiful golden haired blue eyed baby.  Just like Divine Boy was at the same age. And there is no seatbelt on either the passenger or the baby.  You wind down you window and motion to the driver of the vehicle carrying this unrestrained baby.  The driver of this vehicle winds down her window as well.  "Please put your baby in the back seat with a seatbelt on or something - that is so so so dangerous" you say  "Mind your own business" she responds.  "Then go to the hospital and find out what a baby looks like after it's been thrown from a car, when the car has been hit" you tell her, your blood pressure rising and your heart starting to thump in your chest.  "Ah shut up.  You whiteys think you can tell us everything. If you were black maybe you'd have some brains" she retorts, winding up her window.  At this point you realise that the driver of the vehicle seems to be part Aboriginal.  You hadn't realised, or even noticed the colour of her skin.  Just the baby, sitting on the lap of the passenger in the front seat, unrestrained.  A tragedy just waiting to happen.  "I do have brains.  And I have two children who are alive.  You lot die like flies"  You wind your window up and drive off as the lights turn to green.  Then you question why YOU made such a racist comment.  Life seems altered somehow.

      Yep, it's Saturday night and I'm on here posting.  But before you all shake your heads and say tsk tsk this woman has no life...I did go out.  Not really a date, just a bite to eat with a friend.  We were both feeling a bit weary and tossed around the idea of catching a movie - neither of us felt up for dancing like wild things and we decided to leave the movie till next week.  So I am home and tucked up early. Except that I think I will have to go out again because I have a craving for soft drink.  What you call soda.  Which is fattening whatever we call it.  So maybe I'll stay put.  And my leg feels like a horse kicked it. That's good news.  My hair is playing games with me again.  I am so close to having it cut. But then I remind myself that it doesn't behave any better shorter than it does long.  I am going to wash it and straighten it tomorrow.  That should take most of the morning. And them I am going to my favourite cafe to drink coffee and read the Sunday papers.  Alone.  DG and DB are with their Dad tonight.  I committed several acts of random kindness today concerning him.  If nothing else, I feel better about it.  DB has a new Eye toy.  I never touch the playstation but this thing is funny.  I am quite good at ninja - just proves my theory that I'd be really good at knocking people over and kicking ass if I was not so peace loving and anti-violence. After about fifteen minutes of playing this thing I felt like I'd worked out.  (I was careful not to kick with my left leg).  DB and DG sat by and laughed themselves silly.  Which is not hard for them.  My friend S came over with the boys today.  Between the eye toy and the trampoline the kids were on the go all day.  They will all sleep well tonight.  I made pancakes with maple syrup.  And cleaned the kitchen.  And got most of the way through the laundry.  I just sometimes wish I had someone to share the joy of domestics with.  Heh.  I am Domestic Queen this weekend.  So, like I said, tomorrow I will be at the cafe ALONE.  I am quite enjoying some aspects of single, celibate living.  At least I don't have to share the paper, or the cake.  And I can cultivate that 'air of mystery' that men seem to find so intriguing.  Not that the men in this area do.  Most of them are in their seventies.... or, if they are in my age group they are married with children.  The only other news I have today is that my Coco Chanel perfume is nearly all gone so I am now wearing Ralph Lauren.  The divine ones say they like it.  *Yawns*  Ok, now I'm going to meander around and read all about you.   Have a Great Saturday dear readers!

       urlLink Mr G !!!!!!  Now I have to figure out what he wins.  I would welcome any/all suggestions but keep it clean people!!!  I'd also like to make mention of  urlLink Elizabeth  who came a close second. Congratulations Elizabeth and thankyou for visiting.  I suggest everyone else reading this should go and pay Elizabeth a visit and say Hello.   urlLink Deanna , I know you said I should not post any more pics (and I promise I won't - not of my unmentionables) however I feel that I should share with you that we both have the same kind of hair.  Straight, wavy, curly, crazy stupid hair.  The similarities just never seem to end!!  Only I don't have an SUV.  I have a stupid Japanese car which I hold responsible for my current back problem.    Oh please, Japanese readers, do not take offense at my comment.  It is because the car is one of those you have to get down into (combined with the fact that I am just short of six foot in height) that I call it stupid - not because it is Japanese.  *Bows respectfully*  Despite my car, I love all things Japanese.  Especially wasabe.  You have no idea how useful a disciplinary tool the wasabe is in this house.  If anyone says anything really naughty I go and get the tube of wasabe out of the fridge.  That is all it takes.  (And before you all go calling Child Welfare on me, let me just say that I have NEVER actually administered it...I just let the Divine Ones sniff it and have told them that I WILL give them a spoonful of it if they step TOO FAR out of line) Other things Japanese I love are sushi, sashimi, sake, rice paper and Japanese horror movies.   Oh and there is a Miss Kitty tiara that I covet too.

      I'd just like to say thankyou to  urlLink Mr G  for bringing so much attention to The Girls.  If you do nothing else today, please go and leave a comment for him.  Be nice.  Tell him I sent you.  (There you go Mr G, that should increase your hit counter by at least 3, maybe 4) Alls I had to do was post a pic of The Girls in a  new unmentionable (and send it to an ex or two..because...well remember I told you about those kick ass pain killers?  I had too much time on my hands obviously.) However back to  urlLink Mr G . He's a funny family man who keeps many readers entertained daily.  Recently he played a trick, pretending he was some one else and that he had gone away mysteriously. I was devastated as were many others.  Some clever people were on to his tricky ways but I'm Stupid.    Anyway,  urlLink Mr G  sent some very nice people my way who all left very nice comments.  I'd like to think that some of those very nice people come back occasionally without The Girls having to make another appearance.  So a big thankyou from The Girls for your kind comments, and also to Rockchild - hon I can assure you that should they ever reach my belly button I will definitely NOT be publishing THAT picture.  Tell your Mom I hope all goes well and she is UP and about asap.  So, it's Saturday morning here and I am about to commit an act of random kindness (I forgot to do it yesterday).  I hope you all find time to commit an act of random kindness today.  Even an act of senseless beauty will do.  Whatever you can do.  Then please come back and share your act with me. I need the inspiration.  My act of Rk is this:  I am going to ring the ex and offer to pick the children up to save him having to organise a taxi or someone else.  (His license is suspended for another three weeks).  I have not been inclined to do much else but sigh or snort at the mention of his name of late so today I am going to push the borders a bit and do something that helps him out.  I have got EVEN more feeling back in my left leg.  OUCHIES!!  But that means the pressure in the sciatic nerve is shifting slightly which is good news.  It means that I'll be back on that catwalk sooner than ever.  Well just as soon as I can walk properly and lose about 20kgs and 20 years.....but I'm optimistic!!!  Well I'm off to use my power for good instead of evil.  Y'all are probably snoring and drooling on your pillows.    Oh and  urlLink Ms D ...I hope your hair is kinder to you today. *Hugs*

      I love my bed on cold wet Friday nights when the Divine Ones are with their Dad and it is all quiet here.  I am getting more and more feeling back in my left leg and get this....OUCH!!! But I will not complain because it means that I will be able to walk properly sooner and I have pain killers.  I am going to take some now....first for the day...I wanted to see how far I could go and so far so good.  I miss my children but i love this time to myself.  I don't even want to go out, even if I could.  I love my bed.

      Spontaneous Posting.  What sort of sane person has a cup of coffee at 11.30pm at the end of a really, really long day and then goes online?  I guess, that this is the time when I might otherwise be reading.  Having found this very comfortable medium, consisting of bed, fluffed up pillows and laptop and the lack of a present partner (to either love immensely or feel frustrated and irritated by or even, in some cases, both at the same time) I find myself in here tapping out whatever piece of thought like substance that randomly crosses my mind.  Sometimes, for no reason at all I will remember a Charlie Brown cartoon from my childhood.  Or I will  hear, as if from far away, some gentle classical music. And I find that tears fill my eyes and I let them fall, unchecked.  At these times I find I can almost detach myself and move gently away whilst allowing my body to just be there, letting the tears fall.  I am always rather perplexed at my body's ability to create tears.    Anyway, thanks for allowing me to download here.  Despite the coffee, and the pressing urgent problems I have a tendency to worry endlessly at, despite the fact that I can go to sleep safe in the knowledge that those same problems will still be there tomorrow, unchanged and awaiting challenge, I think I may be able to try and sleep now.  Sometimes we grown ups are silly about sleep.  And some of us write impossibly long sentences guaranteed to induce sleep in others.

      I have sat back and exhaled and for some reason this Tears For Fears song just popped into my head.  And I think all good modern blogs must contain the lyrics to an eighties pop song at some time.  Now all sing along with me:    Shout    (CHORUS) Shout, shout, Let it all out These are the things I can do without Come on, I'm talking to you, come on  CHORUS  In violent times You shouldn't have to sell your soul In black and white They really really ought to know Those one track minds That took you for a working boy Kiss them goodbye You shouldn't have to jump for joy  CHORUS  They gave you life And in return you gave them hell As cold as ice I hope we live to tell the tale I hope we live to tell the tale  CHORUS  CHORUS  And when you've taken down your guard If I could change your mind I'd really love to break your heart I'd really love to break your heart  CHORUS  CHORUS

      I'd just like to say that, having given it a little more rational thought, I may have been a little, shall we say, rash? hasty? thoughtless? in posting "the girls" on here yesterday.  So, in a week or so, I shall go back and delete them.  The ones in the blog that is, not the ones on my ribcage.  Let me also point out that it was really more about ze brassiere than the actual contents of said brassiere (and who says we Aussies are a rough and uncultured mob?  Oh thats right, we do.)  That little white ribbony bow thing that hangs down?  I give it one wash (albeit very carefully in one of those meshy lingerie washing bags) on gentle cycle (pictures of underwear riding bikes slowly around the park) and that sucker is going to be fraying.  Annoying little bits of stringy nylon crap that catches on everything.  Perhaps I should go down to the river and bang it on a rock or something.  That's what I picture when I see "hand wash only" written on labels.  Which I can only read if I can find my glasses you know.  Which are usually on top of my head.  Anyway, the nearest river to me is the Torrens.  And that's a bit polluted.  There is Brownhill Creek however.  And due to the prolific rains we have had here of late I am happy to say is flowing.  Like a vengeful uterus.

      quit lurking.  leave a comment or something.  if you  want to or don't want to agree with me or pick a fight with me or tell me that I am full of dooky, well, go away.  Stop lurking.  I am getting NO satisfaction from seeing my hit counter rise and nobody talks back to me (apologies to those kind and loved souls who do...I love you guys).  Yes You.

      I am a bad parent.  I am in here on this  and my children are out there STARVING.  Did you hear me?  They are STARVING TO DEATH IN THERE because I haven't fed them anything for the last half an hour.  You know what I am going to do????  I'm going to order A FULL OF FAT HEART ATTACK STRIPS/BLOW YOUR CHOLESTEROL SKY HIGH/MAKE YOU AN OBESE FAMILY pizza.  Because I have just joined an eastern religious cult that insists that if you are "at that time of the month"  you are forbidden to handle or prepare food and you must go up and live on the roof of your house until you are ready to come down.  I just joined five minutes ago. And I'm gonna skip the going up on the roof thingy because, well its freezing cold out there and I might slip and hurt myself.  Now would someone please dial the pizza joint for me??????????

      Bloody Long Day Today.  Hey thanks guys. I boldly post the girls and two people comment. Forty or so lurk, but two comment. That's one comment per girl.  Don't you people recognise a pathetic attempt at attention seeking when you see one?????????  I was so tired this morning. I didn't think it was possible to get more tired than "I'msoexhaustedIthinkI'lljustliedownhereanddieforawhile" but it is.  Oh and those previous whiney posts? PMT.  TMI?  I love my children so much. As I was driving them to school this morning I explained to them that Mummy is just always going to be an awful woman in the mornings. That she will yell and shout and be generally foul and that they should just understand that this is who Mummy is in the mornings but she still loves her little Angels even though she is telling them that she hopes wild animals come and eat them while they are at school. Or maybe I just thought that bit. Out loud. I don't remember. I was too freaking tired. And driving....  I had an errand to run this morning. I won't go into details out of respect for privacy of those involved (and because of a certain person who lurks in here - yes, you know I know you do and you know I told you to stop it....it's almost as bad as snooping in someone's cell phone if you've been told to stop coming in here you know) anyhoo...what I learnt this morning is that people can REALLY hurt each other. It made me realise that while I may have my problems with relationships and intimacy I'm really pretty lucky all in all. I pray that my children are never hurt like that. I want them to grow up being able to love and be loved, freely and with an expectation that they are worthy of receiving the love of another. It's really sad what people do when they don't feel worthy.  And then just to make this an even longer bloody day...the back specialist who has been handling my x rays and mri scans and such like rang and said that they have found 'something' they don't like the look of in one of the scans. There is no need to worry/panic at this stage...it could be scar tissue or something like that....but it does mean more time spent hanging around hospital consulting rooms (not my favourite pastime) and waiting for results. So I have to head in on Monday and have some more tests done. Yay. (Mental note to self to stock up on "Go home you dick, love Bella" post it notes)  Well, the good news is that I'm not pregnant.  I know, I know...TMI!!!!!!

      The concert was good. The town hall is a pretty amazing place. I took some photos of the interior...oh and of DB's perfomance as well of course.... DG got really restless and I don't blame her. It went on and on. Three hours. No break. An abundance of groups of pre pubescent girls in leotards dancing to pop music. Next year maybe they should just lump them all into one group. Because three hours is a long time for anyone to sit in one place, let alone children. There are some really talented children at that school though. It's got a really good arts/music department and is a big focus in their daily routine. Haven't heard a lot of clarinet practice happening around here of late though I must say. There are going to be some tired and cranky heads here tomorrow morning. Mine will be the biggest one probably.

      People with thick luxurious hair are blessed.  People with thin stringy hair are not so blessed.  Not with luxurious amounts of hair anyways.  I think everyone in the world with thin stringy hair should a) get a decent haircut b) get a collection of hats to jazz up their thin stringy hair. c) shave their heads. Ever noticed how when someone is annoying you, all you notice is things like: their thin stringy hair (or how big their butts are?) I think I could be a nicer person.  Then maybe my flaws would somehow seem lessened.

      So I cut the grass myself.  Next time I'll pay someone to do it.  I'll just figure out what I have to give up to afford it.  Food!  Then maybe I'll get slim again!!  What does a girl do when she has given men up?  She goes and buys sexy underwear, takes photos in it and sends it to all her ex boyfriends.  Anonymously.  Or not....  We're off now to catch a bus into the city.  So we can watch DB in his music concert.  Is a glass of chardonnay considered as one of the five food groups?  I'm going to write a book - The Chardonnay Diet.  You do nothing but drink chardonnay and don't eat. At the end of it all you will be  a) very drunk b) slimmer c) able to afford to have your grass cut  Gotta run!!

      I'm in my nice warm bed. The Divine Ones are in theirs.  All is quiet.  I am going to have an early night and catch up on sleep.  Maybe that's why I've been mood swinging so extremely today....  I called my friend K.  We haven't seen each other for a while and it was good to talk to him about what he's up to.  In the course of the conversation he has offered to help me with my leadlight project by making up my baseboard.  (He is a very skilled carpenter/handy DIY man person).  It really touched me. I had been planning to try and get it done myself tomorrow (among the 1,001 other things that have to be done tomorrow.)  Having him offer to do that for me was great. And now I need to think of something I can do for him.  Not need, want.  When someone is so helpful and thoughtful you want to do something to show your appreciation. I think in my last few posts I have been too self focused and sitting in my sulky little corner looking at what I DON'T have instead of seeing what I do have.  As it turns out, he is really into pottery.  So I am going to make something especially for him.  I feel better.  I feel like eating chocolate.  (I always feel like eating chocolate...)  So tomorrow I am going to be a busy mother.  And tomorrow night my son is performing at the Town Hall.  Which is going to be a carparking nightmare.  I think we may catch a bus there and take a cab home.  The Divine Ones will love that.  I can't remember the last time I used public transport.  I don't even know if I remember how.  Of course, when we lived in Melbourne we caught trams everywhere.  But in Melbourne EVERYONE catches trams everywhere, because Melbourne has trams that go everywhere.  It was really good fun.  Adelaide's transport system doesn't seem anywhere near as much fun.  But still, we live close to the bus route and it will be something new for the children.  I have the weight attached to my leg again.  I can wiggle my toes but I still ahve no feeling in my lower part of my leg.  It's weird. I need to work out at a gym, even though I don't like gyms.  I want to have my lighter body back. Not so that men look at me, I want to feel light again and have the energy that I used to take for granted.  I'm "off" men.  Except for a couple who are really good friends I find them to be quite dishonest and untrustworthy.  Especially the ones who go on the loudest about how full of integrity and honesty they are.  I've just been hanging out with the wrong ones is all...best for me to steer clear of them altogether I think.  me me me me me....oh I need to find something else to talk about....

      and you know what else?  That pill is bloody expensive.  When am I ever allowed to go to the hairdresser?  When was the last time we went out anywhere?  Actions speak louder than words, even if the words are loud. It's all still bullshit.

      Last week I had to use the morning after pill.  I won't go into the why's and wherefors about it but it is really not a very nice thing to have to do.  And then there's the waiting to be sure that it has worked.  All good for the stress levels.  And the other person involved seems to remember and care about it in exact proportion to the time it took to create the need to take it. I had to take the yukky crap, so cut my freaking grass without making a big noise about it.  You know where the mower is.  Just do what any bloody man who cared would do. You know why I say "No"?  Because it pisses me off when people make a big song and dance about doing something for you.  It's just hot air.  Just do it.  Or don't.  But don't bang on about it.  For f*cks sake, how often have I cooked meals and done things for you?

      Went and picked up DG from school.  DB had soccer practice.  DG and I went shopping.  She scored a new ring (she likes shiny pretty things) and I bought a pair of trousers for working in (comfortable and a bit dressier than I normally wear) and a new rolling pin (for claywork).  The trousers were a bargain, they were on a rack and marked down by 50%.  A woman who was looking behind her as she was moving forward walked straight into me.  She was short and wide.  The pain that shot down my leg and up to my shoulder was very intense.  "oh sorry" she commented offhandedly.  "No you're not" I responded "you're just clumsy and not smart enought to watch where you are going".  I moved off, but not before I caught the look on her face.  Her jowls were wobbling and her mouth was a dribbly looking "o".   Isn't it fascinating what a bitch pain can turn you (me) into.  What I really needed was a post it note with "Go home you dick, love Bella" - refer to  urlLink this funny lady's site  for explanation of that one.  Mental note to self:  Get those post it notes!!  Luckily for me DG was too busy admiring her new ring to pay attention to what was said.  Although I suspect she has some idea of what a shrew her mother can be.  I just hope she decides not to turn out like me.  DB and DG are eating macaroni and cheese.  Blech bleh bleh bleh.  But they like it.  The smell makes me feel nauseous.  But it's easy and early dinner tonight as I have to take DG to Joeys (Smallest league in Scouts) and then pick her up an hour later.  Then I am going to have my nightly glass of chardonnay.  I'm swapping dinner for the chardonnay tonight because I am getting too fat.  (I ate breakfast and lunch so I don't need food tonight.)  I only have one glass.  Ok, it's the size of a small bucket .......  Then I am going to read something inspiring and positive and then I will think a happy thought.  Possibly I may be able to fly after that.  And then again, maybe not.  I have much to look forward to.

      Pottery class this morning.  We had a school tour through...lots of teenagers standing around awkwardly watching as we worked.  I had nothing to say. My bowls are looking good and I've bought some clay home to work on a sculpture.  Just to keep my hands busy so I don't go making calls to a certain person. I need to go and get a new rolling pin (to work the clay) and some more freakishly expensive glass to finish my mirror.  But I can't seem to get up off my butt.    Driving was even easier today.  The healing is going well.  I had to buy tickets for Divine Girl and I to go and see Divine Boy's music concert tomorrow night.  I almost forgot, and just managed to get the last tickets they had.  I haven't spoken to the Father of These Children about it because he has been a complete dick lately (and has lost his driver's licence as well....and had an accident in his new girlfriends new car....and she didn't know he had lost his license..and he claimed he didn't know he had....but he did because I made him ring up about it when he was here....) and anyway, I am not responsible for keeping him involved in the children's lives...that's his bag to carry.  The children have been very adamant that they don't want to go to his place this week.  I'm stuck in the middle and will cop the crap for it...  I am not getting any support here.  I'm whingeing and whining and crying again...it's my own Pity Party.  I am doing everything and I'm on my own.  The only people around (with the exception of my sister F) just seem to be around because they want something from me or they want to make me feel sad.  Today I feel like life sucks, love hurts and disappoints too much and I am completely on my own here and always will be. I love my children but for f*ck's sake, I can't do everything, be everything to everyone ALL THE DAMN TIME.  I'm so sick and tired of feeling like I always have to be on top of everything.  When is someone going to come and let me sit down while they cook me dinner? (Ok, A made an omelette for me last week when I was in so much pain I couldn't do anything but since then he has been so mean at times that it makes my head spin.)  When is someone just going to come and cut the grass without making a big deal about it first?  Sh*t, when I think of all the laundry and shopping etc and other stuff I've done to help others out in the past....  When is someone going to buy ME something shiny and pretty?  I pay for everything, I make sure they have what they need, I make sure they get to where they need to be on time, I always go that extra bit for them.  I love them.  I don't expect anything back from these children.  But when is something nice going to happen for ME?  Life sucks big ones.  Please don't comment. You'll make me cry more.  Just ignore me and I'll get better.  Promise.

      Chardonnay is my friend.  It makes me feel relaxed.  It lets me go to bed when I want to.  It doesn't give me a headache.   Cigarettes are bad.  They won't be nice to me at all.  They are not allowed to come round here no more.  Mr A, Bye Bye.  I took the weight off my left leg tonight.  I am getting more feeling back in my foot.  I made pinwheel sandwiches for DB's school party tomorrow.  I forgot to eat today.  But I did remember to take DB to scouts, and pick him up.  He is being 'invested'  next week, so his scout leader tells me.  This is going to cost me.  Of course.  It's all good.

      I made omelette for the divine ones tonight.  They ate it.  It contained several ingredients that both Divine B and G claim they cannot tolerate.  You can hide anything in an omelette, provided it is chopped finely enough.  That's where a food processor comes in.  However, I am using a hand chopper I have had for years.  In tonight's omelette I hid:  4 spring onions 2 capsicums (one red, one green) a large handful of swiss brown mushrooms basil pine nuts garlic onion   and of course, six eggs, laid by A's chickens.  Divine children ate it.  But for some reason, the bloody cat won't.  Well go hungry then puss.  I don't really care.  (It had finely chopped ham in it.  If I'd left it on the counter the cat would have no problems hopping up and tucking in.  He's just being a shithead)

      I am a girly girl.  Even if I'm 41.  I never cared much about my nails but now I do.  I buff and polish regularly now.  Because I give massage I cannot have long talons.  But every morning and every night I tend to my nails.  I rub in Sally Hansen's Get Growing vitamin thingy stuff for nails.  Take it from me, it's good. (Until I find out it's made of some cancerous causing nasty business or whatever).  Having nice nails makes me feel more successful at being all grown up and stuff.

      A has been very supportive while I have been limping around.  I love him and really appreciate everything he has done for me this weekend.  And I made myself re-read previous posts and am on my guard.  Can't help that.  I just can't work out what he wants and why he wants it.  No words with/from J.  Which I guess means that I won't be getting my John Butler Trio cd's.  Such is life.  Haven't returned C's email.   None of this is BECAUSE of A but because I have been laying low.  Pain will do that.  I'm not sure, but I think A might still want to see other people.  But he says he doesn't want me to, so of course he won't let himself.  But really, I'd be ok with him seeing other people, eventually.  Not necessarily because I want to see other people,  but because I want him to do/be what makes him happy.  Moving forwards, not backward.  Or sideways. Or should I say, limping.

      Ok, I've finished posting the pics.  Now for the minutae.  It's been a cold grey day in Adelaide.  I can drive the car now that I have some strength back in my left foot/leg!  But I can only drive to the school and back - after that my back and leg start to hurt too much.  So it's been a stay in and work on the leadlight stuff.  I am repeating myself, I know.   I have one small cut on my middle finger and lots of cut glass that I can't use.  Such is life.   DB has Scouts tonight.  Luckily the Scout Hall is right next to the school so I can drive him there and pick him up.  However, this now means I have to go and cook dinner early.  I am at a loss for inspiration but that is the great thing about kids.  Omelette for dinner works for them.  And the glass of chardonnay works for me too.

      Check out this  urlLink site  - it's Danny Wallace's book.  When was the last time you committed a random act of kindness?  Mine was last Sunday week when I took my neighbour's wheelie bin to the curb (it's collected Monday morning and he seemed to have forgotten).  Maybe he hadn't.  Maybe I just confused him.  So starting this week on Friday I am going to perform at least one act of random kindness.  Why don't you guys join in and we can all write about our random acts of kindness.  oh and thankyou to  urlLink Miss Meep  for her direction to the link.

      Update on the Gimpy Leg  Ok, the numbness in the lower left leg is still present but I can make my toes wiggle more.  I was able to drive the children to school this morning as there is a  little more strength back in my leg.  So this is all good news and I am really happy that the progress so far is quite rapid.   My children are beautiful people.  They have both shown me such concern and were falling over themselves this morning to be good and helpful.  Of course, now I just want them to go back to being self obsessed insensitive little monkeys  - that's all they should be expected to be..they're kids!!  I still have pain in my butt (literally) and down the top part of my leg and sitting or lying isnot comfortable after about five minutes, however, I know that this will ease up.  Considering the state I was in on Thursday night this is nothing but an irritation, a nuisance.  I am going to spend this morning cutting the rest of the glass for my leadlight project.  Then I am going to give myself a pedicure.  If I have to have a spastic foot, it can at least look nice, can't it?   (There was a scene in Kill Bill where the character of Sophie is driving.  You see her perfectly manicured foot with red nail polish, in open toed shoes pressing down on the accelerator.  That image has really stuck in my mind.  I want a big toe that looks just like that.)

Wackiness: 74/100 Rationality: 40/100 Constructiveness: 146/100 Leadership: 64/100  You are a WECL--Wacky Emotional Constructive Leader. This makes you a people's advocate. You are passionate about your causes, with a good heart and good endeavors. Your personal fire is contagious, and others wish they could be as dedicated to their beliefs as you are. Your dedication may cause you to miss the boat on life's more slight and trivial activities. You will feel no loss when skipping some inane mixer, but it can be frustrating to others to whom such things are important. While you find it difficult to see other points of view, it may be useful to act as if you do, and play along once in a while.

      DB and DG came home at 5. Not the happiest of campers. "I never wanna go to Dad's next weekend" was all I could get out of DG (translates to I never want to go to Dad's until next weekend). DB claims that his dad was 'being unreasonable and not keeping his word" (Yep, the world can be a shitty place little one). The father's only comment as he dropped them off was that they had been 'horrible' - which means to me that they were just being kids... Ah ha, I know what it is....The father has had them since Thursday night - three days and three nights...(while I lazed around enjoying sciatica) and I think the novelty probably wore off for all of them after night two. Oh well... I am looking forward to doing fun things with them next weekend. There is a little post coming up about the father but I'll save it until I'm not so tired. Believe me, it's a karmically funny one....  I'm well pleased with myself at the moment. The kitchen is clean. All the laundry is done. The children are fed, washed, cuddled, hugged, loved and tucked up in bed. DB is wearing his ski beanie and looks like an adorable little mouse. DG is sucking her thumb. They are covered in blankets and doonas of all colours and they make me feel...the best.  I have a glass of slightly chilled chardonnay and Pride and Prejudice is on Channel 2. With Colin Firth. Yum. I have clean sheets on my bed. Everything is ready to go tomorrow. (am going to walk the children to school, if it's not raining). Woo hoo... The only thing missing is the box of chocolate truffles, but seeing as how I am on a "lose four pounds a week" regime I guess I'll just have to make do with the chardonnay. And before you say it ...I know there are calories in white wine....s'ok...I'm gonna work it off tomorrow.  I have been pain killer free today and had the urge to do stuff, all day long. Even if it meant dragging my dead leg around with me. It's weird, at times it feels itchy and I go to scratch it only to be reminded that it is a numb as if it has been to the dentist. Weird.  So, it's an early night for me tonight (Monica, you might want to look "early night" up in the dictionary because I think you have forgotten what it is)  Think of me dear reader/s, drooling on my pillow as you sit there, pretending to be working.

      When I lived in Melbourne in the nineties, I met a man in a bar one night. (No, this is not an intro to el sleazo posto). He was on roller blades (this was the nineties), I was on margaritas and we struck up a conversation that is still going now some twelve years later. He is a very passionate environmentalist and I think the world needs more of him..people who really believe in their ideals and care for the environment and the future of the planet. He has designed a website which he updates and maintains to a high degree of excellence. Please make some time to go and have a look. Don't be put off by the name - it's not all about snakes - some of it is - but it is a really interesting, informative site. Pop back and tell me whatcha learnt! The site is  urlLink http://www.snakeshow.net/  urlLink   And another thing about this man is that he was/is/always will be a very special friend to me. He stepped in and helped me through some really tough times and he was always there with his great big smile, his even bigger heart and his love of life and all things good. I can't speak highly enough of this person, and I hope he understands that although time can go by when we don't have much contact he is always in my thoughts and is always considered a part of this family.

      I watched Kill Bill last night.  I had no intention of watching it, but in the end we did.  Whoah, that was a lot of blood.  It was funny.  Not something I want my children to watch for about twenty years or so. I got the giggles when Uma Thurman's character is willing her big toe to wiggle.  I've been doing exactly the same thing!  Now all I gotta do is get me some Japanese steel and things will be just dandy!!! Don't mess with the Mom with the big pointy metal thingy.

      I just lost six kilos in less than a minute.  It started to get a bit hard to lug those weights around on my left leg.  Anyhoo...I have been very productive today.  The laundry, the kitchen and all that jazz is done.  I've cut out more of the glass for my leadlight project.    I've sorted out my bath towels.  Are you feeling the excitement here yet?  Here's something to try.  Give yourself a hand massage using olive oil and sugar.  Seriously.  Do it.  Your hands will thank you.  Oh, and make sure to wash your hands when you're done.  Oh looky...Miss Teen USA is on television....Miss Louisiana was nice looking.  There's just so many white teeth on that screen.  Big white teeth.  It's freaky.

She smells sweet and has creamy olive skin.  She had blonde streaks put in her hair which I regret.  They are growing out now.  She has eyes the colour of the sea.  She has the longest blackest eyelashes I have ever seen.  I think she has the cutest butt I have ever seen.  She is so cute that she gets too much attention from people for being so cute.  Her most annoying habit is sucking her thumb and sticking her hand up my shirt.  (We call this 'fiddling' - she sort of tickles you around the waistline and it drives me nuts when she does it...she has done it since she was a baby and I fear she will never stop.  I think this will make outings with her a bit weird when she is in her twenties.  She can sing. In Arabic.  She shows great promise as a belly dancer and has inherited her father's musical talent.  She is learning to play guitar.  She is a total room trasher.  She does not have a tidy bone in her body.  She thinks it is perfectly ok to have her closet full of toys, books, crayons, barbies and other toys and shove her clothes, clean and dirty, under the bed.  She can wrestle her brother to the ground and pin him there by sitting on him.  She knows the lyrics to every song she's ever heard. It's freaky how she does  it.  She never stops talking.  Except when she's sucking her thumb.  She has a stubborn streak a mile wide.  When she 'digs her heels in' she is just like her father.  She adores my mother.  It's like she's known her before or something.  I was never that close to my mother.    Animals are attracted to her.  I call her Queen of The Chooks because when she is in the chookyard they all form a circle around her. She loves animals.  Indiana (the horse up at the vineyard) adores her.  He nuzzles her hair as though he can't get enough of her smell and follows her everywhere.  He is so gentle around her.  It's beautiful to watch them together.  She is a natural horseperson.  She misses my Dad as much as I do.  She talks about him a lot.  Sometimes we have a little cry together when we talk about how much we miss him.  He used to give her big bearhugs and tickle her. He would tell her stories about a bear that lived in his house that was shy and would hide when we came round...She had just started school when he died and one of my favourite memories is of taking her to see him on her first day.  She was in her uniform and stood in front of him, her great big grinning face beaming up at him.  He told her that she was going to be the smartest girl in the world and go to university and make us all proud.  I think he was right.

      My poor little man.  He felt really unwell suddenly, last night at the long winded cub scouts 'investiture ceremony' and he thought he was going to vomit when they were giving him his badges etc...I was sitting there watching him turn green and started thinking that I should always remember to carry a bucket..as you do.  (I also felt queasy when he had to "swear allegiance to the Queen of Australia".but that has nothing to do with food..just the idea of swearing allegiance to that old bag)   Anyway, I am going to put him - all of us in fact - on a gluten free diet.  I am convinced that his recent bad health is ORGANIC in origin and not stress related..it's that Mommy instinct thing at work.  I started thinking about when he complains about feeling sick and it's always after lunch at school or if he eats burgers etc from fast food joints..which is hardly ever because we so don't like that food.  And when he eats pizza he picks the topping off, eats it and leaves the rest.  I love bread, but I can't eat it every day and white bread makes me sleepy.  Seriously, if I eat white bread within fifteen minutes I feel like I have no energy at all and all I want to do is lie down and nap.  (Then again, I feel like that a lot of the time....oh that's right, I am a Mommy!)   He eats meat, fish, fruit and vegetables so it won't be like a huge change to his diet....just gotta alter shopping habits.   So, it's gluten free pasta, bread and cereal for us all now.  I'll give it six weeks and see how we are going.  He will not touch butter and is a real pain in the backside about having every little bit of fat trimmed off his meat...won't touch milk but loves yoghurt.  I don't think he's worked out that yoghurt comes from milk. I don't buy icecream because a) I end up eating it late at night and it makes me fat..ok it makes me FATTER and b) because I'm a mean Mom.  Just ask my kids.  Am going to go and do my research on all this now.  And one of the potters at the studio is qualified as a nutritionist, so next week I will ask her what she thinks about it all.  So, in conclusion, we are going Gluten Free AND..he is now a Member of The Scout Cub Family and has promised to live by their code.  Tee Hee...I now have leverage.....

      I washed it this morning and blow dried it straight.  It was all soft and manageable and was behaving itself.  Please explain why it is that after half an hour in the car and five minutes out in the wind it just goes straight to hell?????  Everywhere I look at the moment, I am seeing people with short, well managed, funky looking hair.  Why does my hair hate me so much????

      A couple of years back it was Wiggles.  Videos and cds.  Now it's woggles and neckscarfs for Joeys and Cubs.  There is an "Investment" happening tonight (I wonder if I should wear my tiara?) and let me tell you it took some investment this afternoon preparing for it.  Just short of sixty bucks later I have about one third of the gear the Divine Ones require for Joeys and Cubs.  And Divine Girl, Mummy is sorry but you WILL be receiving the handme downs when your brother moves to Scouts and you move to Cubs.  And the father of the children can expect a call with a request to put his hand into his wallet (if he can get past the cobwebs) and shell out some dosh too. Well, if you take the weight of my wallet into account, I've already lost some, right???  Despite my moaning above, I so totally love and adore my children.  I'm quite happy to do these things for them. They deserve the best I can give them.  I want them to grow up happy, have good friends, find people they love and remember their childhood as a good and happy time.  Dib Dib whatever else it is ....now I'm off to polish my tiara.

      It's been confirmed.  I walk funny.  That's why we have Specialists.  They look at us as we walk into the consult and say "You have a distinct limp".  Good Lord, I would have fallen over with my leg in the air, but I already did that in the bathroom this morning and, well, it kinda hurts and so I thought better of it.  So, after another scan, which I must say was performed really quickly and efficiently I have had word that yes, I do need to have some surgery performed to remove an area which is constricting my spinal cord.  I am alternating between sheer sweaty, chest clenching anxiety and panic (I hate the idea of being cut) and a weird sort of deja vu calmness about the whole thing.  One thing I do know is that I no longer have the option of carrying this excess weight around anymore.  The heavier I am when I have this surgery, the more complicated the process is, and the recovery will take longer.  Well fine, I'll lose the weight first and worry about the reason I keep it on later on. Because the one thing I know for certain is that I want to be here for my children - I want to be a big participant in their lives and I can't do that if I can't run, or even walk properly.  I think the children must be tired of hearing me say "Mummy can't do that because of her back".  Updates will be posted as they occur.

      When someone hurts me, it's ok for me to feel that hurt and to sit with it and deal with it.  It's not ok for me to come in here and spout out my venomous bile, no matter how much humour it is coated with.  I came to this understanding all by myself.  And while it doesn't change things at all, at least I feel better now that I can see where I need to go with all of this.  I think that this blog is of better service to me if I use it to learn more about myself and how I can develop the finer aspects of my character.  My humour, my ability to laugh and play, and my capacity for love and forgiveness. I have lots of energy and spirit which I let become overshadowed yesterday by my fears and insecurities.  All of this came to me in a dream last night.  I have removed the posts about a certain person because whilst I think he has done the wrong thing by me, I don't believe that my being nasty and mean and spiteful is going to correct any of that wrong.  This much I will reiterate.  I like to believe that there is good in everyone and I try to work with that.  When I find this not to be the case, I feel the disappointment and then I move on, expecting that I will find good elsewhere.    I want to always be able to look in the mirror and see the good there.    In my dream last night, I revisited what I had posted here yesterday and I saw that it wasn't the good in me.  Quite the reverse.  I owe it to myself to be better than that.

      To the left.  The sidebar.  Down under "view my complete profile" (don't - there isn't a screen wide enough) See?  Huh?  I FINALLY figured out how to put in my LINKY LOVE THINGIES!!!!  I just don't know what happened to the title though...but it seems I am getting smarter by the minute....  So if you think you should be on there and you aren't, it's probably because I'm not THAT much smarter yet but let me know and I'll add you straight away.  Now I have to find out   how   to send  urlLink Mr G  a nice bottle of wine for being visitor 1,000.  (I can hear him rolling his eyes and sighing now...but seriously Mr G...I need to be led by the nose ring....YOU can still call me Stupid.  I like it when you do it...dunno why....)  This day just gets better and better.

      YOU are a nasty piece of work.  Yes YOU.  YOU know who YOU are.  A nasty piece indeed.  Blech. Sickening.  Blech. Blech. Blech.  I can't get the yucky taste you have left in my mouth to go away.  Toxic.  YOU should come with a warning.  Oh, hang on.  YOU do.

      Today I caught up with a couple of good mates.  (Good mates = men friends without an ulterior motive or agenda).  We were talking and sharing, and the great gender divide wasn't so wide for a while.  One of my mates gave me a hug and told me I was ok and was going stay that way.  My eyes filled up and I laughingly pushed him away saying "Stop it!!  You're going to make me cry!!".  (We all know what a Tearie Dearie I am)  "That's because you need to and I want you to" he replied, locking me in one of his famous bearhugs and rocking me.  I didn't cry.  Not then. I will later on when everyone is asleep.  See?  I have learnt SOME control!!  (Oh and just as a side note...one of the other mates did cry.  And they were real tears too.  I am saying a prayer for him that everything turns out ok).  We all decided that no matter which way things go, we are all going to stick together and maintain the solid friendship that we have.  That made me feel so good.  I can't tell you...it was like my whole body was vibrating with my heart wanting to burst. I love my mates.  I trust my mates.  I'd do anything for them.   We drank a lot of coffee.  Coffee which has made my hands shake.  But as you can see, I can still type.  And whilst my hands are shaking I can happily say that I am "still at the helm of this ship".  See..I'm the one on the horizon floating this way and that....like a crazy ship.  But at least it's MY hands at the helm.  I am in control of my journey.  (Yes Deanna, I am saying it over and over and over.....the cat is looking at me strangely).

      Woke up this morning with a Red Hot Chilli Peppers song in my head. That's SO much better than having an Ashley Simpson song in your head, let me tell you.    The Zephyr Song   Can I get your hand to write on just a piece of leg to bite on what a night to fly my kite on do you want to flash a light on take a look it's on display ... for you coming down, no not today  Did you meet your fortune teller get it off with no propeller do it up it's on with Stella what a way to finally smell her picking up but not too strong ... for you take a piece and pass it on  Fly away on my zephyr I feel it more than ever and in this perfect weather we'll find a place together fly on... my wind  Rebel and liberator find a way to be a skater rev it up tp levitate her super friendly aviator take a look it's on display for you ... coming down no not today  chorus In the water where I center my emorion all the world can pass me by fly away on my Zephyr we'll find a place together    I think I woke up with this in my head because last night as I was falling asleep I was watching the RHCP playing live at Slane Castle in Ireland on tv. I had some great dreams.  Fueled no doubt by the tv and the pain killers.....  Well, I gots to get up outta this bed and go and do stuff.  Alone.  Did I mention that I am alone already?  Wish I could hang out with The Red Hot Chilli Peppers.  They look like a bunch of fun people.
