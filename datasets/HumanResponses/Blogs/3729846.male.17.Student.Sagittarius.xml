      I have been busy these last couple of weeks making and editing and designing websites!  First of all, I am trying to put the finishing touches on my Beastie Boys website, that will take a couple of weeks, so i'll keep you updated.  I was also asked if I could create a mini-site for Drama at my college to help promote this play that we are doing called "Work, Leisure, Life and Death". I have created a template and finished most of the pages, but I have got to now put the information on the pages now which will take about 2 hours.  I also have another site in the pipeline promoting myself. I decided that I wanted to create a site for myself so that I can put up a couple of promo songs for my album that I am creating.  I have other websites that I would like to make in the future, so keep posted for further info.  Peace

      I haven't posted on here for AGES, but thats all about to change. Ok this is whats been happning since the last time I posted. I closed 'The Skoop' E-Zine after just 1 issue, the 1st issue was amazing, really good and interesting, but the reason I closed it down was because there was very little interest in it. I MAY start it up again, but we'll see what happens. If I do decide to bring it back, then i'll let y'all know on my website.  Tomorrow (18th August) i will HOPEFULLY have the 'Music' page on my website open, Ive produced 3 tracks and will get them up on the site for you to enjoy.  Im looking for people to join up to the message board, it's takin a little time for the word to spread, so the message board is a little bear right now, but im sure that will all change very soon. I will be adding LOADS of more topics to it, and im also gonna be starting competitions so look forward to that. - If you are interested in being a Moderator for the site then please get in contact with me.  Peace (update tomorrow y'all)
