       So this is my blog.  I just figured out in this hour that i actually have the hotts for Eli. and this does present a minor  problem .    since her and andrew are an Item, and since she is in fact not diggin' me. so i guess all thats left to do is say crushes are just a healthy phase of everyday . but for fiction sake- i love getting crushes on things impossible to have and love just entertaining ideas about the whole thing.   i cant believe i just now realized what exactly was meant to happen in that bathroom at salon. and all i did was blubber about zoe. what would have happened if you had kissed me instead of andrew? would i be in the lover shoes right now? or would it just have been just a drunken fling? BUT i could just be imagining this whole reality.   ps. if god really intended us to walk then he wouldn't have invented roller skates.

      I really dont want to work today. but duty calls.  I think im going to key largo after work with jessi to meet up with cory and buy a stash. yum.  This beez wax makes my hair really nasty but it works. go figure.  Zoe's not comming to visit.she was but now shes not. I'm extremly bummed about this becuase i miss her alot. i think more than i can explain. when you go from dating someone and kissing them and holding hands and sleeping in the same bed to just being friends and living together and seeing them everyday and then in a second its all gone and you dont get to see them whenever you want you realize how much you actually liked their company and the cute things they do that no one else does. its hard though. because i still like zoe alot. i still want to be in a relationship. so its hard to push those feelings aside and ignore them and it seems the harder i try the harder it is. she doesnt know this. no one does. i dont tell anyone because i figure if i dont talk about it then its not really there. but it is. it's like when you move to a new house and can't take your dog because the lanlord doesnt like pets so you have to give it away and then it feels like something is missing all the time and you still feel like its yours but you cant do anything about it. so i have no idea what to do. just pretend its all different .  jeff is so good at stencils. im mega jealous. his no pigs one is awesome! my walls are full of stncils. next target THE TOWN!  i love le tigre in the morning. it gives me that extra pep in my coffee and make me go RAWWRRR oi oi oi oi!

       Christmas,Twin falls, Idaho is her oldest memory   She was only two    It's the first time she felt blue    Cafeteria,harrison,elementry   beneath a parachute   I saw her without shoes   7up i touched her thumb,she knew it was me   although she couldn't see   unless of course she peaked    my moms good she got me out of    twin falls idaho   before i got too old   you know how that goes   thats where she still was the summer she turned 17   In 1983, three weeks after me   last i heard was she had twins or maybe it was three   although i've never seen   that dont bother me    i really enjoy that song above. that and doing laundry has put me in a better mood and tomorrow im going to walk next door and make friends with those boys becuase well i can't just sit around and pout and mope and stomp and be irritated.  these sleeping pills im taking are working very well and put me out about 10 min. after i take them. but im groggy in the morning.  im going to call those places tomorrow that applied to and asked them if they have looked at my application. i always thought they were the ones supposed to be doing the calling. oh well right?  I have decided to stop sending mail. becuase well it sucks when your the only one sending and never recieving. but understandably people are busy so oh well it doesnt matter. i definatley dont want to see maggie in the near future becuase she doesnt think i should care about her so then i wont.  i have this insecurity lately about people, and that im terribly annoying to them so im going to stop talking for awhile and give everyone a break from me.  i've taken off all of my bracelets but four and they are the ones that i have given myself. i dont want to carry around sentiments anymore becuase i feel they just weigh me down. but i still miss them although im not going to lead on anymore becuase it just makes me sad so im going to ignore it.  goodnight.

      Yanno when you have pms and you're already in this horribly bad mood and groucy and already irritated with the world and then everything goes wrong.  Like my favourite head phones breaking so now i have to use these ones who by definition suck and have this short cord so when im on the computer im ON the computer and if i move my head i get yanked and whip lash. Or like the day when all the dishes have all this crusted food on them and you have to scrub and scrub just to get it all off. Or the cute boys accross the street who invite all their friends over and by the time i get the courage to go introduce myself or say hi or say "HEY IM SOOOO BORED PLEASE HANGOUT WITH ME OR TELL ME SOMEWHERE FUN TO GO OR SOMETHING FUN TO DO" they leave. Or the chris who im supposed to hangout with who is busy DIVING instead of hanging out with me which has been moved to tomorrow when i think im so bored i want to cry becuase im frustrated and all my emotions are out of whack.  im in that just fuck you all mood today  WHOA LOOK OUT today.

      When you love someone or something you just cannot entertain the idea of it/them leaving. and when they/it  does surprised,hurt,confused,and anger trails closely behind.   someday we'll know if love can move a mountain someday we'll know why the sky is blue someday we'll know why i wasn't meant for you   Chris is back in town but he has been busy lately. so we have a dinner and  movie date on friday. I'm thinking of things to do for eli for her birthday. ill most likely just leave a happy birthday song(im thinking the beatles) on her answering machine. my crush is gone. I'm very thankful about that.  Porn flicks really dont do it for me. too bad.  My mother showed me my old pony tail from my first hair cut My hair was a different colour then, more blondish redish and it was long . I have to say i miss that, and think it is odd she kept that. I'm craving my youth and wanting to get back into things such as Skateboarding,Horseback Riding,Soccer,and not eating peas.  goodnight.

      So I've been listening to Jeff Buckley alot lately, which reminds me of alyssa alot. It's funny how i can remember someones taste in music, but not what their voice sounded like or how they tied their shoes.  It's a warm summer night, while i'd rather be out on top of libraries or walking for hours with directions written down on paper that i look at every sixty seconds to make sure we're heading the wrong direction, i'm sitting at home, which i seem to be doing alot. My old friends who live here,who im not really fond of anymore are out of town on vacation, all the while i dont like them that much anymore but would hang out with them to meet other people or least be out doing  something,anything.   Actually at this point in my life i am most often lonely and bored. I want something exciting to happen, I want to meet someone exiting,I want to fall in love with someone i just cant get enough of and go through the low points of acheing and the high points of bliss. I want those places i applied to, to call me back. I want a cd burner becuase all of my other cds are played out and are scratched to hell. I want bush to be out of office and the war to stop right now.  I really the cover, dancing in the moonlight. mirah-person person makes me hope thats what eli and faith are thinking.

      I always find myself fighting. or no scratch that. bickering. no, not even that. biting my tongue. yeah thats it im not good at dealing with negative things said to me. all im hearing are the negatives. all that is comming at me are the negatives. when my mother used terms like "when you  had  intelligence" well, that says to me "when you used to be more intelligent and now you're just stupid" when my mother says "i wanted your brother and you to get an education and he has his high school diploma and well you're seventeen and dont nor a drivers license" well that says to me that she does not recognize my efforts into trying to solve that problem and she does not listen to my ideas when i talk to her about photo-journalism and college nor does she recognize the fact that i have my permit . note- i've gotten pulled over in the car with her and had to show my  drivers permit  when my mother says "i think independence its the most important thing and i've tired to teach your brother and you to be independent and self sufficiant but it didnt exactly work with you" well that tells me that she thinks higher of my brother than of i and that i am a waste in her eyes. it also tells me that she doesnt remember when i was 15 and left and survived two years without her.  but  with the help of other very kind people(not including my father), but i managed. note: my brother is a 21 year old with a child and a fiance living in a trailer in his fiance's parents yard and doesnt pay rent and he works for his father who is going to  give  him the buisness... my brother got his g.e.d becuase his friend craig did most of it for him(geometry,biology,algebra,history) and i (at thirteen years old) got blackmale used against me for smoking cigarettes and i did his english,grammer,and his acceptance essay. when my mother says "everyone tells me i have raised a selfish unappreciative rude child" well that says to me exactly what it says that i am selfish,unappreicative and a rude  child.  do i say anything back to these comments? like how they offend me, how im trying to make myself  something  how im desperately trying to be on my own,how those comments really hurt my feelings? why no, becuase that would lead to a fight and im still nervous about her raised voice becuase it used to lead to a raised hand and then to a swinging hand. i just sit quietly and stare off into space pretending im watching tv and cannot hear her, and if im still upset later on in time i simply take a shower,smetimes cry, or just go in there to be away for awhile,and sit in the shower thinking and replying to myself all the comments i should have said back.  but that is neither here nor there, i can look at this in a positive way and how it is motivation to get the job,work the job i wont like,get the money,get the car,leave.  i would talk to someone about this,but i dont really like talking about things becuase if i talk about them then i get upset and that would be embarassing, and note-its 1 in the morning,who's up? . my point exactly.

      the thing i miss about annah is the sex far more better than the new jersey girl who had to listen to oldies how could one not sing along and giggle. aparently that ruined the mood. but anyways as i was saying. it was just so damn good and for the first time  i  actually felt like i was performing well for the first time becuase i didnt feel the need to impress this woman. and thank god since their were two before her i didnt have those first time second time jitters. but i still lust after her and i have picked up some new techniques that i am dying to try. i've only had sex with four women in my entire life and in a few years im sure ill meet people who are better sex partners who care to stick around longer.  i would get a call girl any day of the week its a fetish along with girls in white shirts ties and thigh highs.

      Alot of things going on lately. I'm feeling very torn between saint augustine and urbana. i have friends in both places you see saint augustine i have known longer but have somewhat grown apart in some aspects i still keep heather and zoe y and tiffany but in different levels. and then urbana which has not been there for all the history in the making but sure is going to be there for future makings and i have become close, very close. i feel obligated to saint augustine becuase well they are older but i feel obligated to urbana becuase they are just so splendid. so i'm thinking about just none. i cant have both so i wont have any. its better that way in retrospect. i've talked to zoe about this and she says im selfless and should just be selfish sometimes and do what would make me happy. i need to talk with kaldari about some things i would really like to get to know him better, he's so interesting and wonderful. i also want to get to know santana becuase i have placed an opinion based on other opinions and i'd like to make my  own  opinion. My mother seems to not care either way as usual.  I'm worried about maggie becuase well she has such  potential  basically i feel she is going to shit. shes going to a very very good school and getting an excellent education i mean she could do anything she wanted. anything i fear she will just settle for less live in a shitty apartment, work a shitty job,eat shitty food, and sleep next to a shitty,stinky,asshole for the rest of her life and it will go all up her nose in those line forms. maybe im being too judgemental and parental like. if that would make her happy to do that then i just need reassurance becuase i dont believe it. i've tried to talk to my mom about it, as usual she does not care about anything or my thoughts. which is depressing  i really need to get those applications turned in but i feel so shitty today, mentally and physically worn out. tomorrow.  i dont want to eat until some of this is solved, just stressed.  p.s the commenting is going off to no mans land. this is just for overflowing thoughts.

       where exactly to begin. zoe, my sweetest friend,former lover,former lust.  my darling girl . please dont leave me here. Oh,how i am full of love and caring feelings. that little trickle of warmth inside getting fuller and flowing faster by the days. i am comforted by forces far,far away. though there are miles between us, love still travels through rain,snow,and tears through telephone lines and mailboxes. my sweetest,sweetest friend i hold you so dear and close that i fear to let go my security has set in   i build each one of my days out of hope and i give that hope your name i know there is strength in the differences between us   will we overlap
