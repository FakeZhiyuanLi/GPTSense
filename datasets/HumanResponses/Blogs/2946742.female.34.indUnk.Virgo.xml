      He can't do anything for himself I am just like his little Elf   He orders me around Til I feel like I might drown   Babe this, do that Do this, babe that   Make my coffee Make my lunch Get me something I can munch   Wash my clothes  Clean the sink Now get me something I can drink  Clear my dishes Watch me dress Boy, the house sure is a mess!   Why can't we go out tonight? Oh, we're broke...  I forgot...  That's right   Well, give me the remote, techtv is on Now help me up so I can use the john   Now I want you to sit with me There's no room?  There has to be   I love you though, I know you're a pain... But everything you do just drives me insane!

      Where is my baby oh where can he be I saw him just two weeks ago his body so small his heart beat unseen he had a lot more to grow  I longed for the day I would see his face And hold him in my arms It hurts to know he could not grow I would never cause him harm  Something went wrong my baby was gone the saltwater stained my cheeks so soon was he taken my heart is still breaking it had only been two weeks  I feel so sad I miss him so bad I wanted my baby so much And though he is gone I need to be strong My heart will forever be touched  I miss my baby

      My helium tailed cat Smiles as he struts  Where ever he's at People think he's nuts  It's not because he's fat Though he has a few guts  He's a good cat Though some prefer mutts  I give him a pat And a few bucks  So he can buy a rat Because he hunts  He doesn't use a bat Because he's a klutz  He'll sleep all day  If you let him  He likes to play When the room is dim  He'll lay on the mat He'll lay flat  Except for his helium tail

      When I was little We played we were men I didn't play barbie's unless I was Ken  I'd wrap a towel around my waist After swimming at that park pool place  I didn't like pink I preferred blues and greens Hated wearing dresses I'd rather wear jeans  One Halloween my friend was a nun I dressed as Superman That was really fun  We used to sing along to "Grease" She was Olivia, I was John  Love to climb trees  Ride bikes and play cars now I enjoy the nudie bars I'm not like other girls!  :-D

      Another piece of her dies  When he says those words She has empathy for them She used to be them  She hasn't forgotten  From where she came  He is from another place  He has never known that life  It doesn't make sense to him He's always had it easy  Everything he wanted was his  She didn't know it when they met She will never be good enough  But he won't let her be anything less  She knew motherhood before freedom Though she does not regret it  He only knew freedom  Without regret   and so it goes Another piece of her dies   Freedom must wait  She is nothing if not a possession  What need has an object for emancipation?   They are on oposite ends of extreme She's always been the strong one He's always needed help Now he is all powerful And she is the helpless one   and so it goes  Another piece of her dies   And her pen her only confidant  Depression her only way of life  What's wrong?  He says Nothing I wouldn't expect you to understand You would have had to be there  Like a plant deprived of water Another piece of her dies   Just like Chevelle  I like having hurt So send the pain below  Where I need it

      I used to know myself so well But that was a long time ago Before I knew ME I have no identity I don't know ME anymore  We used to play silly games I'll be Paul you be Gene Do you know what I mean?  Can a book really affect your personality? I think I'm having a Cobainism  I used not to worry I used not to fear I was just living  seems like I'm happier lonely than trapped Used to think love was a party Turns out it's super glue

      Hanging by a thread Waiting for a sign Only time will tell If he really is mine Waiting alone for hours, Days and even weeks, months and years What am I doing wrong Why isn’t he here? He will not tell his family or friends about me It’s like I don’t exist I don’t know what’s going on Obviously there is something that I’ve missed If I really am his girl… Then why can’t they know? Why won’t he show?

      Do you keep my picture with you? Do you think of me at all? Does my name come up in public? Would you be there if I call? Can I trust you with my heart again? Would you hurt me like before? My mind doesn’t believe it When my heart says, “I want more” Will it ever happen for me? Why do I love you still? My mind says that I’ve had enough But my heart still wants your fill. Do you love me? …Then show me that you will.

      I hold in my hand a ring,  One that has never meant a thing. Given by a man who can… but won’t. He says he loves me but doesn’t show it. Maybe he does, but I wouldn’t know it. The lies he tells make me wonder why. I stay up late… sometimes I cry. Why does he hurt me so? Everyone tells me but I still don’t know. He says that he loves me. Why does he say it? This game that he’s playing, I don’t wanna play it. Everyone says that he’s still with HER. He doesn’t tell them different, so… I’m not sure. I want to be loved unconditional; Forever. But will it ever happen? My mind says Never! He wants me to want him, but not the way that I do. Will it last forever? Or are we through? He does what makes him happy… not caring if it’s right. I want to know the real him, but it always ends in a fight. Why? Why do I still care? I love him

      I had one chance But now it's gone  Beyond my control And now it's gone  A life inside to care for Another life to share  Now it's gone forever Never another chance  A new life never to be held Forever my loss  Never a chance again  My one chance has passed My one chance has gone

      Last night I dreamt that we stayed after the concert and partied with the band Saliva. After the show, they were turning the Orbit Room into a skate park with ramps and everything. Weird. I don't remember any more than that. I had to get up too fast to think about it.

      I was going to the job at the bank. It was way up high. The way to get in was like trying to get into a treehouse. There were cement notches in the side of the building that I had to climb up to get to the door. It was kind of leaned away from the building too, so it was hard to do. Lucky there was a tree right next to it to stop me from falling.   I finally got up to the door and entered. It was a big room with two smaller rooms in it. I went into the room right in front of me and closed the door. There were a bunch of other people in this room sitting at tables. I found a place and sat down. I was listening to people talk and found out that all these people were about to loose their jobs. They were talking about how unfair it was. That's when I realized that I was in the wrong room. I got up and left immediately!   I went into the other room where people were being taught how to use the machines and how to sign in. I went over to sign in, but the machine had the wrong date on it. I had to move the date back for it to be right. I did my job and then it was lunch time.   I went outside to get on the bus. I had to go home. I was sitting near the front of the bus. Actually I was standing. There was a man standing behind me that kept smiling like he knew me, but I didn't recognize him. Then there was a Mexican woman and a little boy who were sitting. The boy was sitting in front of the woman, even though it was her son. The bus was very crowded. We were driving into a storm. The sky was very dark and it looked like it might start pouring any minute. Some more people left and I was able to sit down now. I sat next to the little boy.   I finally got home. I think it was my parents house though. I went inside just as my daughter was walking into a hornets nest. It was inside the house and I saw her go into it. She ran outside to get away from all the hornets. I laid down on the ground and covered my face with the hood of my fleece. I pulled the sleeves over my hands. I just laid there waiting for the hornets to pass me by, but they didn't. They all came to me anyway and started to sting me all over my body, right through my clothes.   I finally got up and ran out the door. I went into the garage and took off my clothes. There was a shower in the garage, for some reason. The garage door was open though. I didn't seem to care. I started washing off. I could feel the hornet stings all over me and they were starting to itch. I made the water warmer and just kept scrubbing my arms and legs to make them stop itching. Then I woke up.

      We were on our way to a party somewhere. Christopher was driving. It was a motorhome. Two girls we went to school with were there too, Michelle and Bridgette. They were all smoking weed and offered me some. I told them I shouldn't because I'm trying to find a job. So, they just shared it amongst themselves.   It was a long straight road and it was at night. We were looking for the road to turn on to. It was going to be on the left side. Just as we were passing it, Chris said "There it is". At which time, the motorhome spun completely around. We had missed the turn. Rather than turning around, he decided to just back up. So, he is backing up on the opposite side of the road... through a red light... that a cop car is waiting at. Ooops! The cop puts on his flashers and Chris has to stop. Before the cop asks for anything, Chris is giving himself up. He says "Here it is. Take it all" and throws out the bag of weed. Well, I'm sleeping on the bed in the back and I hear all this going on. I'm thinking to myself... "Why did he do that? The cops didn't know he had it."   How we got out of this, I don't remember. We are on the road again driving to the party. The party is in a cave under ground. It has two rooms. The first room is filled with masturbating men and the second room is filled with Hippies smoking weed. So we head for the second room. And that is were we hang out all night. Then I woke up.

      Sara is frantic. Jason's wife has just been killed upstairs. We don't know who did it or why. Jason is going to be next. Jason talks Sara into marrying him so that the killer won't get their money. Weird.   Anyway, so Sara writes on a piece of yellow legal paper...   "I take you, Jason Van... How do you spell your last name?"   "V-a-n-d-e-r-Dddddd"   "What was that? Vander???"   "Dean"  So, it's written on the paper and she signs it and hands it to him. He signs it and for some reason it's legal now. They are married.   He knows he is going to be killed so he tells his best friend Josh, "You and Sara go! Take my car." He wants them to have his money. And after he is dead, Josh and Sara can get married. So, they leave out the front door and up the driveway walks Joe. He starts asking them where they are going. There's no time to explain. Joe has a crush on Sara and you can tell. Sara and Josh have to get away before the killer comes after them.   The vehicle is parked so that the drivers side is next to the wall. It was backed in, obviously. It is too close to the wall to get in. The killer is coming. You can hear. Josh gets under the truck and lifts it just enough to move it away from the wall. Then he gets inside and starts it up.   The killer has just made it into the garage as they drive off. The killer is chasing them and somehow gets in front of the truck. The killer has a gun. You never see the killers face. They almost hit the killer with the truck, but somehow miss. The killer hands the gun to Josh, who throws it back out the window and starts speeding down the street.   About three blocks down, you notice that you are on a movie set. The trees are fake. The grass is fake. Everything is fake. We pull around the corner and around another corner. We drive into an open elevator. Now we are driving a mini cooper, not a truck. We turn the car around in the elevator and when it opens, we drive out. We drive down the hall to another elevator and do the same thing again. When we come out of the second elevator, there is a case of carpeted stairs. We drive down the stairs and keep going. We are inside a hotel. We drive out the front doors of the hotel and keep going. We arrive at a stadium and walk inside.   Scene Change:  Police Station... The Cops are after us. They are searching for us because they think that we killed Jason and Amy VanderDean.   Scene Change: Back to Stadium... Josh and Sara are sitting in the bleachers. Joe comes in looking for them to warn them that the killer is there. Sara realizes that she thinks they are being framed, because she still has the pen. The same pen that she used to write up the marriage certificate. She thinks they are after her because of the pen. Josh and Sara are looking at the pen and discover that it opens. There is a piece of paper inside. It's folded up and rolled so that it would fit inside the pen. They unroll it and unfold it to discover instructions for making an origami pig. Weird. The killer is after them for this??  The killer is coming down the aisle now. The killer is drawing attention by putting one hand up in the air and giving the Ozzy sign. There is a gun in the other hand. The killer spots Josh hiding under the bleachers and comes towards him.   The killer is close enough now that we see who it is. The killer is Jason VanderDean's own sister. She fires the gun five times but misses. Now she is standing right above where Josh is hiding. She bends down to shoot him in the head, but she is out of bullets. She is mumbling incoherently about why she killed her brother.   Flash Back to VanderDean home. Pictures on the wall show that Jason VanderDean is a little person, a dwarf. His wife Amy is not.   Back to present scene... Sister is still explaining why she killed her brother. Sister is also a little person. She says that she was mad at him for marrying Amy, someone who is not a little person. So, she killed him and his wife. Then she was coming to kill Sara and Josh. She wanted the money, but still couldn't get it because her brother married Sara. She had to kill both Sara and Josh, otherwise Josh would get the money.  The police finally show up in the middle of all this and arrest the sister.  Credits Roll...   Jason VanderDean played by Jason Bateman Wife Amy played by unknown woman Friend Sara played by me as Jennifer Love Hewitt  Best Friend Josh played by me as unknown man Sister played by unknown woman Joe played by Jay Mewes (from Jay & Silent Bob)

      Prince Dream...  I was at some kind of company party. It was a big dinner. There were a lot of people and Prince was there. He had a bag of lemon drops sitting in front of him and he kept eating them. He got up to use the restroom and I kept watching the door, waiting for him to come back. Then, I couldn't wait anymore. I had to use the restroom. So, I got up and started towards the door. Just then Prince walked back in. He met me half way from the door to were he was sitting. He was facing me, and my back was towards the wall. He put his hands on my arms and we started to dance, just a little. He said something to me about wanting to be alone with me, but he didn't think I would. I assured him that I would! I said "I don't even need to be drinking to be alone with you"! I hugged him and then left the room. I was in a mall. I spent the entire rest of the dream searching for a place to be alone with Prince. On the top floor, there was a Christian rock concert going on. Couldn't be alone there. I took the elevator to another floor. Too many people. Next floor, still too many people. I went to stores and shops all over the mall and there where people everywhere! I ended up at a place like Chuck E. Cheese or similar. It was an arcade with tons of little kids in it. I wasn't really looking for a place to be alone anymore. Now I really had to use the bathroom. The rest of the dream I spent looking for a bathroom. Then I woke up and I really had to go! Damn the dreams that I don't get to be alone with Prince!   The Prince dream before this one is posted on April 24,2004.

      Weird Dreams, Again...  I had a strange dream last night. It was another of those that come in pieces. First, I was traveling with my mother. She had a motor home and we were stopped. She was sitting in the back on a couch and I wanted to get going, but she wasn't ready. She was looking in the phone book for something. I asked her what she was looking for. She said she was looking for "Cosmopolitan". She said it was a band. I told her I'd never heard of it. I asked if they had made any albums. She said they did. She was getting frustrated because she couldn't find them in the phone book. I said "maybe it's under the singer's name".  Next, we were going to Taco Bell. We were going through the drive thru, but we were walking. There was a strange guy with us named Stanley. I have no idea who that is, or why he was there. He had short curly red hair and green eyes. He was obviously of mixed race by the tone of his skin. When we got up to the drive thru window, Stanley reached inside and pretended to take money out of the register. Some kind of joke I guess. We got our food and paid for it, then we left. After we left, I noticed that I was holding one of those little golf-type pencils. For some reason, I felt like I had to return it to Taco Bell. So, I went back thru the drive thru and gave them the pencil.  Next, there was a Middle-Eastern doctor who gave me eye drops that was supposed to be some kind of medicine. I think it was for allergies. I used it and then my eyes started bleeding. The blood was all dried up around my eyes. I went to the bathroom to wash it out. This happened a few times. Every time I got it cleaned out, it started to bleed again. I could feel the blood dripping down from my eyes like tears. Then the nurse of that doctor was there in the bathroom with me. She was telling me that it was meant to do that. It was not really medicine. I was mad and I kept kicking her as she was trying to leave the bathroom. She was trying to walk behind me to leave and I wouldn't let her.

      Dream  Last night I dreamt about a little ghost girl with long blonde hair. I was holding her about my head and spinning around. I told her to hold her hands out in front of her so it would feel like she was flying. Then I asked her if it was fun. I told her that when I was little I wanted someone to do that to me, but no one ever would.

      Bits and Pieces  I dreamed that someone on our block had five Dalmatians. They had a huge display in their front yard. It included five couches (one for each dog) situated in a circle around a fireplace. Evidently they had decided to get their dogs new couches because there were five hot-pink couches at the curb for pick up. The new couches were powder-blue.   okay  I was trying to climb through a window for some reason. It was way up high and I had to stand on a bar stool to reach it. The windows were little like ice-cream-shop size.   don't know why

      Dreams... from last night  First Dream  I was at my mother's house and my cell phone rang.  I answered it and heard "Hey Buddy! What's up!" It was Dan, one of my ex-boyfriends.  I said "Who is this?" even though I knew already. I had to act like I didn't know. Tony was standing right there. I said "How did you get my number?" I didn't give it to him. He said "The Doctor's office gave it to me" I said "They're not allowed to do that" I wanted to talk to him and I wasn't really mad, but Tony was standing right there.  I couldn't.  interpretation:  telephone for a woman to dream of talking over a telephone denotes she will have much jealous rivalry, but will overcome all evil influences.  Next Dream  I cut my right pointer-finger. I don't know how. It was a really deep cut and you could see straight to the bone. I put some Neosporin on it and covered it. It wasn't bleeding, just an open gash. After that I looked at my left arm and it was covered with ringworm. NASTY! Not just my arm either. My entire body was covered. It looked like a maze all over me. I woke up immediately. Eek!   interpretation:  cut to dream of a cut, denotes sickness or the treachery of a friend will frustrate your cheerfulness.   ringworms to dream of having ringworms appear on you, you will have a slight illness, and some exasperating difficulty in the near future.

      Sleeplessness and Strange Dreams...  Playing Pop & Drop just before bed can only lead to one thing... Sleeplessness!   So, I lay awake last night for, what seems like, forever! I started thinking about things I should do in the morning, like... Exercise, write in my blog, check my email, buy cough medicine for Tony, buy the new "Rolling Stone" with Prince on the cover, go to counseling, etc.   Then I started thinking about things I should do this week, like... really start looking for a job, pick up my pills from Walgreens, wash some more laundry, etc.  I started comparing Collapse to debt consolidation.   I started wondering if I should try to pay off my Line of Credit first, one of my credit cards or one of the dentist bills? I owe less to the dentist. But then again, the boy really needs some new clothes. hmmm...  When am I getting my next Child Support check again?  What else can I sell on eBay? Or should I just try to sell the stuff at my mother's garage sale? It might be easier. When is my mom having her garage sale? I could print up price tags.   I wish Tony would quit coughing. It sounds like he's dying! Have to remember to get cough medicine!   When is Father's Day? We just had Mother's Day and I don't remember when Father's Day is.   What the Hell am I going to make for dinner tomorrow. Oh, that's right, I took some chicken out of the freezer.   So, FINALLY... I fell asleep... thinking of all these things.  Next thing I know I'm shin-deep in a crystal clear spring. You can see the white sand through the water. There are Opal-colored crabs frolicking around my feet, rushing in and out of their underwater caves.   My nephew, Jimmy is there. He says to me "Aunt Sharon, can I take my shoes off?" To which I reply, "Well, I suppose... but if you do, you better watch where you walk."  So, of course he does take his shoes off. Then he is just standing there terrified, because about a thousand Opal-colored crabs come out of hiding and now he has no place to step. I start thinking... hmmm, Opal-colored crabs can't be very common. Maybe I could sell them on eBay? I could make some money that way. How would I send one through the mail? Maybe a Styrofoam box, like what they ship steaks in.  Tony starts coughing franticly...   Then I'm somewhere else, standing behind my mom. I notice that she's gotten her hair cut. It looks awful. My mother has a mullet!   I say to her "Mom, did you get your hair cut?" To which she replies, "yep".  I say to her "Is this how you wanted it?" She says "yep". Why would she do that??   Tony starts coughing franticly...  Then I'm sleeping at my mother's house. The phone rings and my mother wakes me up to tell me the phone is for me. Who could this be? I answer it, half asleep, and it's a man. Evidently someone who works for one of the survey companies that I do online surveys for. He says "We wanted to thank you for all the surveys you've done lately, and for all your help we want to send you a bonus check for $60."  Tony starts coughing franticly...  I wake up to go to the bathroom and when I open the door there is a room full of kids! Who's having a slumber party? What are all these kids doing here?  Tony starts coughing franticly...   What a strange night!  Now, I'm really awake... I must get Tony some cough medicine!    inperpretation : water. (to dream of clear water, foretells that you will joyfully realize prosperity and pleasure)  crabs. (to dream of crabs, indicates that you will have many complicated affairs, for the solving of which you will be forced to exert the soundest judgment. this dream portends to lovers a long and difficult courtship.)  nephew. (to dream of your nephew, denotes you are soon to come into a pleasing competency.)

      More Dreams... (guest starring Prince)  We were out camping with a large group of people. Most of them I didn't know. But, my mom was there and both of my sisters and Tony. It was far away but I'm not sure where.   It was nearly time to leave and I took my suitcase and put it in the back of someone's trunk. After all, we were all traveling together, I thought. After the car drove off, I realized that those people were not from our group. I felt so helpless. I just put everything I had in the trunk of someone's car that I didn't know!  My mom said "Don't worry about it. When they get home they'll see that it's not theirs and send it back to the airport. It has you name and address on it anyway".  So, I tried not to worry, but I was still worried about it.   Next, we were riding in my mom's car, which used to be my grandma's car. We were parked at the top of a hill and my mom got out. I don't remember why. Anyway, the car started to roll and no one was in the driver's seat. I jumped over the seat to stamp on the break! The car stopped just in time.   Now we were in a parking ramp with a cement wall in front of us. All of it was one way and I couldn't figure out how to get back to where my mom left us. So, I parked the car instead.   There was one of those "Air Bounce" things there. I wanted to go in it. So, I did. Only, now I had a bike with me. They let me take the bike in with me.  Later, we were going to a club. It was a couples club. It was me, Tony, my friend Alisa and later my mom showed up. I'm not sure why she was there.   Anyway, as we were walking in, a naked guy walked past us heading in the opposite direction.  He said to Tony, "Hey, Dude... It's a nudist club. You might as well get comfortable".   Then Tony looked at me and asked "Is it"?   We both looked around at the crowd. There was some nudity, but no one was completely naked except the guy that told us that. Tony took his clothes off anyway.   We saw some people we knew. They were dancing. There was going to be a "Drag Show" so we found seats close to the stage and sat down.   Gina and Victor were sitting in our row and I gave Victor a kiss.  The row was seated... Victor, Gina, Alisa, Me, Tony, Mom.   I was saying to Alisa, "I don't think my mom knows what this place is. She really shouldn't be here".   My mom was watching the "Drag Show" and had NO CLUE that they were not really women up there. The contestants were all lined up against the wall waiting for their turn on stage. I was looking down the line-up. That's when I saw Prince!   He was helping one of the Drag Queens fix her dress. I noticed him and told Alisa. "Look! There's Prince"! I reached out to him and yelled "Prince..... Prince.....". Trying to get his attention.   It was so loud with everyone talking. I could barely hear myself. Finally, he looked my way and I leaned over the partition and reached for him. I couldn't believe he was coming near me. He was so close now, I didn't have to yell to be heard.   I said "Prince, I Love You"! He looked at me and smiled.   He said "What?, No "HEY..." first"?  He took my hand and I whispered to myself "OH MY GOD"!  He said "Would you like to sit over here"? He motioned to the judges seating area.   I said "I would LOVE to sit there"!   He helped me over the partition and seated me across the way. Then he sat next to me. He was to my right.   I felt a tear in my eye and said again "I love you so much"! Then I kissed him on the cheek.   Alisa asked, "Should I take your picture"?  I said "Definitely! Take a lot of pictures"!  Then I woke up... (sighs) I wanted it to keep going...

      Another Strange Dream...  I was on the set of "Three's Company" but the set was my old apartment on Countney St. In my dream it was really my friend Alisa's apartment who lives in Arizona.   I was there visiting Jack, Janet & Chrissy. They had a little Pug dog named Frank. He was mostly black but had some white too. He was just a puppy and he had a wounded left paw. He was lying in a wicker basket and I was petting him.   Then Alisa and her little daughter came home and I happened to notice that the livingroom floor was covered with "Cap'n Crunch Cereal with Crunch Berries". So I had an idea.   I was going to help the little girl pick up the cereal off the floor and throw it away. I went into the other room to get a plastic planter pot. (one of those that looks like it's made out of stone but it's really plastic. Looks kind of like a bird bath) I went to get that for her to put the cereal in, only it was covered with a wire cage which contained a small white rabbit with red eyes.   I picked up the cage and moved it so I could get to the planter. I picked it up and brought it back to the livingroom. By then, Chrissy was already sweeping it up. She swept it into a dust pan and emptied it into the planter, but there was still more and the planter was full.   I went to empty the planter in the trash can and when I came back, the cereal was all cleaned up. My friend Alisa was straightening the rug on the floor. There was one corner that wouldn't stay down. It was kind of curled on the corner and stuck up just a little.   She asked me to fill up this Coke bottle with water so she could set it on there to keep it down. So, I went to the kitchen and was rinsing out the bottle. I happened to look at the cap and it was a winner!  You have won a Hot Fudge Sundae from Dairy Queen! So, I finished rinsing the bottle and filled it with water. But, I didn't put the cap back on.   I gave the cap to Alisa and told her it was a winner. She looked at it, then said "Emily! You won a Hot Fudge Sundae"! The little girl was so happy! She was smiling and jumping up and down!   Then Tony turned on the light and I woke up. He had to get ready for work.

      Strange Dreams...  First I was in a competition. There were two teams. It was all very strange. It took place at the mall. One team, each player had 12 drum sticks (like what you play a drum with) and the other team, each player had 12 eggs. The object was to toss each drum stick or egg and then go and pick them up, all 12 of them, and put them in your basket. You had to keep doing this until you got to the end of the mall. But when I got to the end I had more than 12. I had like 23 or something like that. Very strange.  Next, I was in a car riding with my ex-boyfriend. We were talking and then he started telling me that my teeth weren't "white" enough. I tried to defend myself by saying "it's not my fault. Whenever I go to the dentist, I get my teeth cleaned. I can't help it if they're not "white" enough". I was looking out the window and he kept driving. I opened the door and he kept driving. I turned and jumped out of the moving car. I landed on my butt and didn't get hurt at all. I got up and jumped onto a train that just happened to be stopping right in front of me. After I got on, the train started to move. I saw my ex-boyfriend coming toward me just as the train rolled away.  Next, I arrived at an abandoned building. It had a rusty elevator which I pushed the button to get on. It took me to the top of the building where I lived. There where no windows, just open panes. The whole place was drifted with snow. This was my place?

      Tight-Rope Walking...  I had a strange dream last night. I was at a park somewhere. On all sides of the park were tight-ropes, like in the circus. There was a guy there, younger than me, teaching me how to walk on them. He explained how to do it, then he did it. After him, I did it. I made it around the whole playground without falling! After that we were standing in another area of the park. There was a fountain made of white stone. It was old and moss was growing on the bottom. It had sculptures of hands in it. The boy was looking into the water at the hand sculptures. He said something about "things like this, always intrigue me". Not sure why he said it. Then a lady came walking by in a peach-colored business suit. I asked the boy if he could teach her how to walk the ropes. He told me "No, because she doesn't want to learn."  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Dictionary of Dreams - 10,000 Dreams Interpreted by Gustavus Hindman Miller  (I bought this book while I was living in NY. I refer to it now and then. I will do that now.)  Ropes - To walk a rope, signifies that you will engage in some hazardous speculation, but will surprisingly succeed. To see others walking a rope, you will benefit by the fortunate ventures of others.  Fountain - A clouded fountain, denotes the insincerity of associates and unhappy engagements and love affairs.  Learning - To dream that you will take great interest in acquiring knowledge, and if you are economical of your time, you will advance far into the literary world.  Moss - To dream of moss, denotes that you will fill dependent positions.  Park - To dream of walking through a well-kept park, denotes enjoyable leisure.   I was unable to find anything about sculptures, business suit or playground.

      My Dream Last Night...  We were on some kinds of family vacation. I don't know where. We where in a rented house or apartment. Something like that. It was us, my mom and dad, Mary and someone I'm not sure who, that had a baby. I remember when we first got there. Half of the curtain on the door was missing and nothing on the other 2 windows. The half curtain on the door was kind of a brown and tan flower print. Just little flowers and vines. I attached a different piece to the bottom to cover the window. The new piece didn't match at all. This new piece was red and blue plaid. Also put this on the other 2 windows.  Later we were all sitting down and whoever it was with the baby was standing by the table holding the baby. I got up and went over to her and asked if I could hold the baby and she let me. He must have only been a couple months old. He had dark black hair and blue eyes. Blue eyes like mine. I asked if I could feed him and the woman said I could.  When it was time to go home, I was there by myself packing everyone else's stuff. I don't know why. No one had put anything in their suitcases. There was a pantry and some of the cans were open and still sitting on the shelf with the unopened stuff. That's all I can remember.

      Overslept  I was so tired this morning. I got up and took the kids to school. That was about 7:30. Then I came home and went back to bed. I figured I would wake up about 10:00. I always do. Well, I slept and slept. Had some pretty weird dreams which I don't fully remember. Something about being a kindergarten teacher and rolling up a roomside carpet that's all I remember. When I finally woke up, I looked at the clock and it was 12:59! I can't believe I slept that long! Great! Now I'm going to be up all night! Anyway, I'm not tired anymore. :-D

      My dream last nite...  I was going to meet Usher Raymond for some reason. My daughter said for me to make sure I got his autograph for her then she handed me a peanut. So anyway, I met Usher and told him, "My daughter wants your autograph" and I gave him the peanut. He broke it down the middle so it was 2 pieces now and flat on the backs. He took out a fine point sharpie and wrote Usher on both halves. I brought it back to my daughter and told her how he did it. She told me it was impossible. Not because it was too small, but because "He couldn't have written it with a marker on there, only a pencil. A peanut is too oily to write on with marker" What???

      My dream last nite...  I dreamed I was working in a domino factory. I don't really know what my job was. I think I was filling domino orders to be shipped. I was working with my friend I used to work with at the bakery. She must have gotten me the job. I remember being worried that it wasn't going to pay enough. But I had to keep working there, because if quit now, I couldn't collect unemployment. There was another guy working there too. It was someone I went to high school with. He was standing next to me. Whenever no one was looking I would lean over and kiss him. Later, after work, my friend from the bakery and I got out our hoverpacks and started flying around my parents house. Then my mom came out and told us to stop.

      My dream last nite...  I was on some kind of island vacation. I was the only biological girl there. I was surrounded by gay men and drag queens. I was perfectly happy and accepted by everyone. It was kind of like camp in a way. The cabins were set with bunk-beds. Everything was made of wood. Outside the main building were tables set up banquet style all in one long row. The tables were covered with a long white tablecloth. Near the ends were little stands which held a large ashtray suspended over a table-like wooden tray. The tray held cigarettes, matches and condoms. Everyone smoked Winston Lights if they smoked at all. I don't smoke anymore but sometimes in dreams I do. Everything was free and everyone got along. There was an unlimited supply of fresh fruit and that is what everyone ate. There were pineapples, coconuts, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, kiwi, grapes and every other fruit you can think of. There was no fighting at all. Nobody littered. There were no mosquitoes. Everyone could do whatever they wanted at any time. There were other small islands which you could walk to. They were all connected by little bamboo bridges. Each had built in street lights which kept them lit. When it got dark out, the lights came on automatically. There was nothing on these other islands but palm trees and sand. There was clear blue water as far as the eye could see. The sky was even more blue than the water. Many people could be seen bringing blankets and picnic lunches to these other islands. If there is such place as "Paradise" then this place was it.

      My nightmare last night...  We were at the house where my grandmother lived. My son was on the side of the house walking towards the back where I was. Between him and me there was a big python, about seven feet long, with it's head in the air looking at my son. It frightened me. I yelled out "Eli, there's a snake"! But he kept walking towards me. He saw it. I guess he thought he could get around it. He tried, but then it bit him. He turned away. I wanted to go to him to make sure he was alright, but then the snake started coming after me. I got within about two feet of the snake when I noticed that it was not going to stop. I started running the other way. Then I looked back and saw that I was not going to be able to outrun it. I laid down on the ground and covered my face and hands. I remember thinking "maybe it won't bite me if I just stay still". Just then I heard my mother come out of the house and yell "Sharon, there's a snake"! I picked my head up and looked at her. Then I woke up.

      Create your own show!  Have you ever fallen asleep in front of the TV? If you have, and most of us have at one point or another, then you know the effect it can have on a dream. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, try it. If you have the TV on loud enough to hear the words, when you fall asleep, there's a good change you'll dream in Dolby Stereo and Technicolor! It's quite entertaining! Especially if you're watching something you like. This can also be accomplished by listening to the radio. I highly recommend the WGRD morning show. I find myself laughing in my sleep every time I do this. What's better than being a part of your favorite radio show?  I met Tony & Tina today! Maybe you know they came to Grand Rapids to get married. I got to hang out with them as the radio station was interviewing them. Then when the radio station said to call in for tickets to Tony & Tina's Wedding... I couldn't find my damn cell phone! There was a bunch of them lying there in the dirt, but every one I picked up was not mine! So, I didn't win the tickets! Then the interview was over and I was trying to go home, but I couldn't remember where I parked my car! I was wandering up and down the street! I'd swear it's not where I parked it! Just then the parade came though... Three guys with drums and symbols singing...  "Two great La-Z-Boy chairs... (bang symbols)... One great low price... (bang symbols again)..." over and over again... God I HATE that commercial ! Had to get up anyway, the dog needed to go outside. Oh well, there's always tomorrow's show!

      Things have been pretty weird lately. I actually got something for Valentines Day. (I never have before). Nothing great. Candy and a heart man with sweet tarts inside but then that was Valentines Day. (Last Friday) and I didn’t see Brian again until Sunday and when I did see him on Valentines Day, it was just in the morning for about an hour. We didn’t have sex. He brought over the candy and took me to lunch. (That’s a first) he’s really been acting strange all week. He was over Thursday night to watch “Party of Five” with me. We always do that. We had sex. He said he wouldn’t be over Friday cuz he was gonna stay home and watch the Bulls game. Fine, whatever. Then he calls me Friday and says that he had a rotten day. This and this and his windshield wiper came off he says, “So I have to go get that replaced tonite cuz I got a show to go to tomorrow. Ya know what I’m sayin’?” (He always says that) so I said “you’re going to a show tomorrow. So. I thought you said you were staying home to watch the Bulls game.” He said, “Well, some things are more important than staying home watching the game.” Whatever! Like I’m not important or something. So now he thinks I’m telling him what to do. And says that I have an attitude. So he’s gonna give me a couple of days to “cool down” like he didn’t already plan not to come over all week, just like last weekend. Something ain’t right and then  I had a really vivid dream last night that he was fucking some girl in his kitchen. It seemed so real I was pissed when I woke up . I know that’s crazy, but it was just a dream. I think he is fucking around. How else is he gonna go from coming over every night to coming over only once or twice in a week? Tell me. I don’t think this will last much longer. (You know it all started when I moved and didn’t give him a new key). If he’s not gonna live with us, he doesn’t need one. Right? I’m getting really sick of his crap. I think we’re through. I’m not gonna call him. That’s for Damn sure!

      I slept really good last night.  I dreamed that I was sleeping next to Brian . The seminar has gone very well. Homework is to come up with “your greatest accomplishment”. I think I would have to say, becoming independent. I’ve done it before and I know I can do it again. I just got a list of subsidized housing and I’m going to fill some applications for some of them. Soon. My check didn’t come today like it was supposed to. I hope it comes tomorrow. I got one thing to say. I was 10 minutes late to the seminar today. All I can say is “driver’s seat”. Brian knows what I’m talking about.

      I went to Brian’s last night (Thursday) and took a nap til 5:00 am. That’s all we can really call it. I have to be home before my kids wake up. Also before my mom or dad wake up. They would probably have a fit if they knew I stayed most of the night. I don’t know how else to spend the night with him unless we finally get an apartment together again. I can wish can’t I?  I had a dream that we didn’t hear the alarm and woke up at 6:45 am instead of 5:00 like we were supposed to. I was mad and yelling at him because I knew I had to be home before the kids woke up. I came home and there was one light on downstairs. Eli was awake. He said Heather was still sleeping so I told him, “Don’t tell Grandma I was gone all night.” He said he wouldn’t. Then I went down to go back to bed and my dad was down here doing laundry. He started yelling at me and being sarcastic like he always does. He said “what, were ya out talking in the car all night long?” Then I woke up and it was 4:58 am. Brian took me home . Everyone was still sleeping. No lights on. I wish we were still living together. I miss him so much when we’re not together. I love him.

      We were driving south on Pine towards my old apartment on Fifth Street.  The car in front of us was a red Fiesta with a blue driver's side door.  I'd recognize that car anywhere.  My ex-boyfriend Brian used to drive that when we were together.    We turned east onto Fifth Street and somehow slid right into the back of Brian's car.  The car was crushed from the back corner to half way up the driver's side.  Tony kept on driving.  He didn't know who it was.  I saw Brian trying to get out of the car.    I told Tony, "You have to stop.  It's required.  You hit him."   Tony drove down about 2 blocks and we ended up at an outside mall like the one at Universal City in California.  We got out and were walking towards the mall.  There was a group of Puerto Ricans near the entrance smoking a joint.  Tony stopped and was talking to them like he knew them.  He called one of them "James".  Later, we went back to my apartment on Fifth Street.  I guess we were living there.  We went inside and there was a party going on.  I saw the chick that Brian left me to be with.  She was pregnant.  She didn't recognize me.  I saw Brian but he kept running away from me every time I tried to talk to him.    I went back to the mall later by myself.  I was eating at a McDonald's there when Brian came up to me.  He was dressed as Ronald McDonald but I knew it was him.  No one sounds like him except him.  He said "I need to talk to you, but we can't be seen together"  That's all for that part.  Later, Tony was deciding to make a green stripe down the side of our car by scraping it on the side of a building that was green.  He did one side and then the other.  It looked really bad.

      I dreamed that I was in a house that I've never been to.  I was looking around, trying to find out how to get into the attic.  I found a loose panel on the ceiling and climbed up.  I found some old art work that I did in high school up there.  I was looking around on all the walls for a place to hang it up, but I couldn't find any nails.

      I dreamed that I rode my bike to  urlLink James ' house in California.  I saw him walk out the back door and I yelled "JAMES!"  He said "What's wrong, what happened!"  I said "Nothing, I'm fine.  I brought you something"  It was a Christmas present.  It was a Shrek 2-place dinner set.  It had 2 rectangle shaped plates with Shrek Christmas theme pictures on it.  The silverware that came with it was miniature like kid size with the same theme.  I don't remember any glasses or cups.  Next, I dreamed that  urlLink Chris , Michelle and I were walking down to the beach.  It was night time.  When we got there, it wasn't really a beach.  It was a pool, but somehow there were waves in it.  The sand came all the way to the edge of the pool.  We got in to go swimming and kept riding the waves.  Sometimes they would almost take us under, but I wasn't scared.  We were all having a good time and it was all for fun.

      I dreamed we were moving back to New York. There were boxes everywhere and I was packing.   I dreamed I was taking a bath in a really big tub. It was like one of those old claw-foot tubs. The water was really deep.  I dreamed I was searching the newspaper for a job.  I dreamed that we cloned our dog Asia and then we couldn't figure out which one was the original.  I dreamed that a new couple moved in next door and I was dating the husband and Tony was dating the wife.  I dreamed we were at a party somewhere and there were a lot of people there. I was suggesting to Tony that he should trim his chest hairs. Another woman at the party then grabbed his chest hair and started straightening it out. When she was done, she was half way across the room and still holding on to his chest hair. It was really long. When she let go, it all sprang back into place. It was really curly and thick.  I dreamed there was a black kitten that kept jumping onto my left pant leg. He was holding on with his claws. I was just walking around with this black kitten on my ankle. Then I sat down and started feeding him honey from a bottle. He liked it.

      I was walking towards a building through a war zone. A large group of Asian men were dressed in uniform and firing weapons. There were planes flying and a lot of smoke from the guns being fired. I was just walking normal and upright through it all. I was not affected by any of this.   I got to the building and went inside. There were no lights on. I was wandering from room to room. It was like the inside of a hospital. I felt like I was inside one of those mystery games for PC and I didn't know what I was supposed to do next. I was just wandering around, lost. I suddenly became fully aware that I was dreaming. At that point, I knew I could do whatever I wanted. But, I couldn't seem to think of anything exciting to do.   This building was somehow connected to the mall and I soon found myself inside it. I located a pet store within and went inside. I was looking at puppies. There was one in particular that I was interested in. It was a tiny black pug. He was the cutest thing ever. I wanted to take him home but I wasn't sure if it was going to be okay with Tony. The woman at the store had told me that the dog would not get much bigger than he already was. He seemed to be about the size of a Chihuahua but not as skinny. I decided to take him. I knew Tony didn't want a little dog. But, I didn't want another big dog. I'm not sure how that went over with him. I didn't get to that scene.  Next, I was in a Science class or Biology (I'm not sure). We were studying frogs. We all had these things that resembled giant ant farms, but with water pipes inside instead of sand. They were split in half to show the inside of the pipes and encased in thick plastic. You could see several live green frogs inside the pipes. They had somehow gotten inside the pipes and could not get out. The pipes were like a maze with added parts on it that did not belong. The frogs were lodged in several spots where they had grown and were unable to ever be removed without being destroyed. We were supposed to sign the consent form that said something like... I consent to the removal of any frogs found inside building pipes. I understand that they will be destroyed preceding removal.   After this, it was not a building procedure anymore. It became an operation. I was having surgery to remove the frogs from inside my body. I'm not sure where they were. Maybe inside my intestines?? When the surgery was done, there was a big pile of dead frogs.   Then I woke up!

      I wish I could remember all of it.  I dreamed I was on vacation somewhere with my friend Alisa and my daughter.  Actually, my daughter was only in one scene.  We were staying in a hotel.  I was taking a bath with my friend.  She was telling me that she saw Prince and he was staying at THIS hotel!  I was so excited!  Somehow, she got us invited to his hotel room.    We were looking out the window and up.  Across from our room we could see him in his room, which was probably on the 3rd floor (You know...  like, 319).  We watched for a while and then someone came rushing through our door.  It was a bald-headed guy with a white bike with no front wheel.  He ran in and threw the bike into the pool.  (It was a strange room that had a pool in it.)  I tried to call the front desk to complain.  I didn't know what our room number was.  Then I saw it on the wall, 169.  The man started chasing my daughter around the room, but when he heard me calling the office, he left.  We went over to Prince's room.  There was a crowd of women around the door trying to get in, but only me and my friend were admitted.  Cool!  We went inside, and it was like a birthday party.  Prince was eating cake as he was lying on the bed.  He looked so cute.  I came running and jumped on the bed.  I landed on the opposite side of where he was sitting.  I started feeding him cake and he had it all over his face.  I wanted my picture taken with him, but he said "Not right now".  He wanted to wash his face first.  I got up and followed him to the bathroom to help.  Then I don't remember this part.  Next thing I know I'm outside at a festival or something.  It's like we are in the Sims game.  When people see the Star, they start walking towards him.  I saw him, but I kept my distance.  Then he recognized me!  He grabbed my hand and we started dancing.  He didn't say a word. We just danced.  Then he brought me back up to his hotel room.  It was just me this time.  He was carrying me around the room like a kid.  I was sitting on his hip facing him.  I could feel him on my leg!  :-D  Later, I wanted to show him  urlLink my drawings .  So, I took out my sketch book and handed it to him.  I sat on the bed next to him as he turned the pages and made comments.  He was impressed!  The pictures in the book, I have never seen before.  But, In the dream, I drew them.  Maybe I can draw them for real.  That would be cool.  I spent the whole day and nite with Prince.  It was like he was my boyfriend and not a celebrity that I know I will never meet.  It was really nice and I didn't want to wake up.    But, Tony left the door open...  and the cats came in and started fighting at the foot of the bed.  I tried to shoo them out, but it was too late to get back to my awesome dream.  Damn!
