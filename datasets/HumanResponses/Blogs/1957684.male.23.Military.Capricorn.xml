         Humm.....I am writing but there is nothing in particular I have to write about. This week has been very stress free and I have been a bum. It is strange that no matter how strong I think my convictions are on anything I will daily stumble and compromise. The latest one of my compromises came when I hurt my wrist while at work. Actually, very honestly I hurt my wrist while jokingly punching a coworker. You must understand that this is some of the silly stuff that we as marines do for fun. Yes for as much as I put up a front I am a very immature person. Well anyway what I then did knowing that if I told them I hurt it while messing around I could get in trouble was make up a story of course. The bad part is that I told everyone of my coworkers what happend as well as my direct supervisors. I even said that I thought I should just tell my officer in charge what really happend. This I did probably to sound moral. My supervisor told me just to stick with the made up story which I of course consented too. I kept thinking of the post I read in Joanne's blog about the student who came clean about cheating and the commitment it took.  Life is hard for in my case when I do come clean on such things which is really just doing the right thing I imagine God aplauding my goodness while completely excusing all of the bad i do. It is so easy even in our attempt to be humble to start to take pride even in our humility.  I suppose as I have grown as a Christian I have more and more adapted the doctrine of total depravity. For without God unchanging, God all merciful all powerful, and all loving I would be most lost. If you could take the time please pray that I could have some amount of integrity in my life. Meaning make the man I show the world and the man I am am in my thoughts to be the same.  Well as long as that man is more Christ and less me.......

      I can't make the little shout out thing come up on my blogger......Can someone help? I highlighted that little format they had for it and put it in the body, but I guess I did it wrong. If some one is willing to help I am more than willing to say thank you. I dare you to test me on this one...                                                                       Sincerely,                                                                          The new guy

           Right now I am taking a basic philosophy class through University of Maryland online. I really love philosophy I do, but this class is not the kind of philosophy I was thinking about. In this class we talk about stuff like does feminism provide a positive direction for society, is prostitution immoral, should pornography be allowed. These are just examples of the topics usually covered in the class. I know you are thinking "these are great topics to take a stand on what could be the problem".  For me the problem begins when the other students in the class say "I have the right to watch whatever I want I am an American, no one can tell me different" this they say to pornography. (never considering there responsibility as adults and parents to raise healthy children) Then with prostitution the answer is "Prostitution is horrible, the human body is something special not meant to be sold. When I have sex with my significant other it is something very special and private". What normally follows every post are these words....."But this is just my opinion, not saying I am right, after all who am I to judge what is right and wrong for another person". The problem is that very few of my class mates have a sure stance on anything.  How can I determine what is truth using the preliminary requirements used to determine whether or not a statement is meaningful such as (1) logical consistency (2) empirical adequacy and (3) experiential relevance when we have no common point of reference. The fact is I cannot.....  They claim the intrinsic right to view pornography on one hand than on the other claim how sacred the act of sex is between two adults and how wrong it is for someone to sell there body for money are completely contradictory. When I approach this issue using the set requirements for any philosophical view such as the Law of non-contradiction. I am told that I should not pass judgment on others who am I to say what is right for another person. Thus affirming the Law of noncontradiction. The fact is that each of us, implicitly or explicitly, lives by certain precommitted principles that are considered to be the nonnegotiables of life. We do not just arbitrarily believe everything we hear, but consciously or unconsciously, test propositions to determine their truth of falsehood. Once a proposition has been tested and proven to be true, we may choose to ignore the ramifications that follow, but we can no longer question it's veracity. Unless of course all truth is subject to the opinion of the individual, although we may not agree we are certainly in no position to say they are wrong!  Augh! We have denied all absolutes and eradicated all points of reference with which to test truth. We have enterered into  terra incognita  on matters of the greatest importance even for survival.       I am really at a loss here as to what to say... How can I defend a position where there is nothing to defend besides my own opinion? Which  is no better or no worse than Charles Manson's. Yes I said Charles Manson and I use him as an extreme measure....But those of you who hold to subjectivism go ahead and apply your system of noncommitment of truth and you will see you have no grounds from which to judge a man like Charles Manson. Sure you can say the law's of the land but then we must question how each individual interprets those laws. Can we condemn them for a wrong evaluation of the law? If I am wrong in my conclusions please rebuke me, but do so using some system of logical argumentation. I think anymore subjectivism and I will be sick. I want to go off on the exclusive claims inherent in all belief systems even those like Hinduism which are "all embracing" but I will leave that for another day.  Oh! By the way I had a good day today just exasperated at the use of absolute claims in order to deny absolutes. Just some thoughts be Blessed...........Keep the Son in your eyes! James

         I just finished another wonderful Marine Corps day. I hope that by saying what an average day consist of I do not shatter anyones vision of "America's greatest fighting force". This day began like most others you wake up at 0500 in the morning go on a formation run. You know the ones where you see them all in step singing running cadences.  This is not that bad although unbearably slow for my taste. The songs are very tacky also the themes consist of outlandish things like doing PT (Physical Training) runs in heaven with Saint Peter and Chesty Puller(who is the Marines most decorated war fighter and a drunken wife beater) after you die in combat.  After this we proceed to our appointed place of duty(work) at 0800 in the morning. I am a Lance Corporal a lower rank in the Marine Corps that is an E-3 for those of you who know pay grades.  What this means is I am the guy given the orders. Things which apply in the rest of the world, things like knowledge of job, experience as a Marine, and capabilities as a leader and any other admirable trait are meaningless until you pick up E-4.  Corporal... I am what they fittingly call a "non-rate" along with anyone else E-3 or below. This basically means that I have no rights outside of those given me. This works out wonderfully when it comes to accomplishing simple tasks, seeing as I have about 5 people in direct supervision over myself and about 30 other people just like myself.  These 5 people usually disagree in every aspect of accomplishing simple tasks such as counting phones. So instead of just doing something once we do it 5 times in 5 different ways. Well each one insist "this is the way it is supposed to be done those other Sgt's are idiots".  I learned to laugh at this....I try to reserve all negative judgments which I often find creeping to my mind in the form of rebellious sarcasm. I try to remember that these people are the same old as me and are doing the best with what they have.        Being a Marine is wonderful! What other job can you get yelled at for not making your bed properly in the morning? We clean all the time I think I have a complex about dust now. The Marines are convinced that dust hidden in the deepest recesses of your room are the very thing which is going to lead to an untimely death. There is also formations it is understood that the only way that a group of people can understand anything is if they are in a box formation for at least 30 min. Oh Well......     My petty gripes and complaining aside. I must constantly remind myself that I am not here to do my will. I cannot be like everyone else cursing my superiors under my breath, only doing enough to get by and falling into the vile jokes and talk which are so common amongst Marines. I am here to do the will of the Father. Jesus Christ! The name which has completely transformed my life.  When I think back on what exactly he has meant in my life all I feel is awe... The same awe as looking out at the constellations on a clear moonless night. All of my apologetics all of my proofs that I now use to defend the Gospel of Christ did not bring me to Christ it was seeing  my depravity. Realizing that I am a sinner and that Christ died for me, He is my redeemer. In the end all of my searching for the great truths in other religions and philosophies I was brought nowhere. It was when I accepted Orthodoxy the great mystery of Christ which has always been in front of my eyes that I found Life! He alone is Awesome! I live now to be his ambassador to the Marine Corps

      Time  Indifferent to the withering of flowers, you draw on. you care not for worldly powers, once their gone.  words fill the void, so long as they cease not songs hopelessly employed,  appease not  cruel you seem, as you relentlessly break my fleeting frame Fool! I scream, as I daily jest His name defame   Poets lament, lovers cling all in you will feel deaths sting  I fear not, these vestiges once cast aside My wars fought, these mortal bonds denied  Claim your last, for when He returns! your moment's passed, the last page turns  No more, as we usher in eternal day No more, homage to time forever to pay  Rejoice ye saints,  for Christ was ever true What eternity paints, is a portrait of His love for you                                          -James Quinn Mechaley

      Thursday morning in Okinawa, right about this time, I should be doing operational checks on the gear that I work with or cleaning, but I am here writing on my blogger.  Good news in my life as of right now would be that I qualified expert on the rifle range on Tuesday.  What that means is I shot about 38 out of 50 shots in the black. This will really help me in getting promoted, something I really need to do.     Other good news is that a good friend I made over here in my first year has just wrote to me. Eric is one who was able to go 12 rounds and be passionate about what he believes, but also able to admit where he was wrong. We came so far in our talks! He went from claiming to be a existentialist atheist, to a agnostic to claiming there has to be an absolute truth which comes from a transcendent being or else life makes no sense. He told me before he left that there can be no middle ground. I left him with the challenge to see if Jesus Christ adds up. If he is really the way, the truth, and the life. Anyways, he now lives in California where I will be moving to in about two weeks. I have a feeling God still has work to do in this young mans life as well as mine.     I just got dumped last night....bummer huh, I can say that I seen it coming for I really did. I know, I put it in the harshest terms possible maybe not to fair. I have been in a long distant relationship for almost 4 months, total the relationship has been about nine months now. I heard stories of so many failed long distance relationships, I thought if I remain faithful that this one would be different.  I really just feel foolish for trying to make it work in the first place. Really, how childish of me! I blame this on the fact that I have never really had feelings for anyone. So in this case when I realized I felt love and felt it fully recompensed. I automatically said to myself, "this could be it, this could be the one." Not that I had been looking for a relationship when I initially went to Korea in fact that was the last thing on my mind. I made a decision early on not to feel ever again. It is hard to explain I suppose I have abandonment issues with my family, wasn't hugged enough or something. Accepting Christ in my life made all such decisions void. Nevertheless, my childhood still seems like this dark storm cloud on the horizon, ready at any moment to come back and rain on my parade. This time it was me being ignorant in my first real relationship, saying "this will work we are in love...." All the while knowing that I have to many unhealed wounds for a relationship to begin with.     I think I forced something that wasn't there. What I mean is that I wanted so badly to share my heart with another that I forced the relationship to progress where it had not. I am really sorry about causing so much unneeded pain through my selfishness, I am sorry about being so ignorant. It is funny that this experience with dating that so many have so early on I am just now having. I am hurt sure, but really my pride is getting dealt the real blow.    I am sorry for making her feel "this burden" as she put it. I wanted to ask her to define burden, but what is the point? She really let me down easy, you know the whole "let's be friends and have nothing change between us." and "you never know if God intends us to be together maybe someday it will still happen." To this I said let's be real....If we do not want anything to change in the way we talk then why are we breaking up? And if you truly believe God intended us to be together why would we give up now and forsake this "great burden?" I do not blame her in this it was really the right thing to do I am glad she did not hide how she felt from me.      What I believe happened is that the butterflies in the stomach passed and in this day and age that is what love is defined as. A feeling, an emotion, something which when felt it is great, but when it is gone we wonder why we acted so strangely. The whole concept of dating is not biblical at all, In the Bible you see daughters being given in marriage by their fathers. The father was responsible for the protection and purity of his daughter. His responsibility to be protector and provider was then passed on to her husband. This is clearly taught in the Bible but I am sure I would be called a fundamentalist or old fashioned for saying this. (as if that is a bad thing.) Whatever dating has it's success stories too, so I will leave the issue to those more qualified. Well I could go on venting all day but I had better end this here. I put my trust in Jesus Christ for he has not and never will fail me.

       Saturday night here in Okinawa and as usual if it is not raining the weather is perfect. I am still in shock about the news that I am leaving this place. When I take the time to reflect upon all that i have done and experienced in my time over here, I am overwhelmed. This place is truly a subtropic paradise which I now realize I did not apreciate as I should have. It is kinda silly now that I am in my last few weeks I am trying to suck the marrow out of Okinawa, trying to experience everything I can. Today I just drove all around Island and found Japanese malls that had T-shirts with misspelled words. I think they are hilarious to read.  I wonder if such humor is reciprocal? If they laugh at us when we think we are looking cool in our shirts with Japanese and Chinese writing on them? Anyways, back to the experiencing this place, I think I will wake up tommorrow and take some good pics of the sunrise.  I hope to have a picture page up before to long so that people can see some of the nature pictures I have taken, as well as some of my freinds from home and those I have made while abroad. Anything else happen today? Well nothing I can think of now off to bed. Shalom

          It is bed time now but as usual I am wide awake. Strange how habits we learn so early on shape our lives. Such as eating junk food, staying up late watching to much TV and a host of other petty habits. Of course this is not completely determanistic we can at any moment change our minds. G.K. Chesterson says that "habit, is habit breaking" so blatently true and rational that is what I like about him. When I talk about breaking habits I am talking about habitual sin that I have in my own life. As I read my earlier post they seem plauged with one question. Maybe I did not state it directly but it is definetly implied (Do I love God?)      Well I have come to a conclusion.....Yes, Of course I love God! Why have I been struggling for four years now trying to break myself free of my old man and all that that entails? Why do I even wonder if I love him or not? The issue is that I do not love him perfectly and I do not love others perfectly.  I truely want to, but I don't. I have a great example to follow thankfully and am trying to grow in understanding of Him. Shame, I believe is natural and to be accepted as something which works towards repentance but is not meant to an unbearable burden or a scarlet letter which we wear. Once shame has served its purpose of making us aware of our wrong doing we need to give it to God. The reason I have been struggling so much is that I want to do it alone. What I truly mean by alone is by any means except for God which obviously is a bad way to go about it.     Ok, Something that relates to right now......I have just found out today that my extension to remain overseas has been denied and I will be living in the great state of California in about 3 short weeks. I really don't know what to feel about all of this right now. Initially I feel nothing, nothing at all I am kinda saying well....California is a good state. This does crush the hopes I had of possibly being stationed back in S. Korea again, but I am certain that this to will work out for the greater good as well. I have much more I want to write so much to be thankful for so much to repent of so much growing to do. In his time I know.                                                                                      Shalom,                                                                                          James

      Lost and found Who is it, who walks your road?  One amoungst this ramshackle lot, who carries your load.  Am I he, could I be, a man who searches for true light? Or yet again, here in sin, do I wander in endless night?  Plans seem righteous when they are my own. In a company of fools without you, I'm alone.  Deceived by a thousand lesser lights, deceived by my own pride,  deceived by what I thought was right, deceived into a lie.  Hear my cry as it shall not cease, till in your arms I'm found hear my praise and unspoken plee's, place my feet on solid ground  Word of truth, Word of life, Word that became flesh and died. Flesh that laughed, flesh that cried, flesh who's spilt blood crushed the lie.  This same Word that became flesh, I now call Lord. Daily am I pierced, by this double edged sword.  To know you, to show you, the only acceptable sacrifice I can give. To go through, to be new, the death which means life with you to live.

      I have come to the conclusion that I am nobody. I am one who fails at every commitment ever made. Most importantly my commitment to Christ. I hardly ever pic up my Bible anymore I feel like such a fraud. The Word of God I know to be his love displayed to a wretched unworthy world. He became manifest in the flesh to redeem me!? I know that he is omni- everything which means that becuase I have accepted Him He will not just give up on me. For He knew the very moment I would forget him, the very moment I would rebel in my heart and He forgave it....all of it on the cross. I am so sorry Lord! I can say these words with all emotion, with full sincerity, but why will I walk away and forget him in my next breath? This is the dichatomy of man we put God in a nice little box so we can sit at the throne of our own hearts and make Him our conveinant footstool. I ask how can our Lord be so long suffering? Forgetting that long suffering is one of his eternal attributes that can never be diminished. I am a carnal, nominal, luke warm Christian... Can such a one even be considered worthy of the crown of life.  I preached a sermon a while back in my home church I called "free grace, at a price" In it I basically said that if we truly considered what was done on the cross for our sake, made it our daily meditation, and honestly strove to pick up our cross daily and die unto ourselves. Then there is no way we could continue on in the sin that we do. I was reading Bonhoeffer at the time and hopefully reconciled it with the grace of God properly. 2 John v. 6 says and this is love that we walk in obediance to His commands.... Read Psalms 119:97-128 and you will see the link between love and obediance. John 14:15 Our Lord himself says; If you love me you will obey my commands. Galatians 5:6 says that....For in Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. 1 John is chalk full of what our love should look like. I am talking about gift love here the same love which was displayed when Christ willingly went to the cross for our sins even though we did nothing to deserve it. I know even now all my righteousness is as filthy rags and I am Justiflied by Faith and there is nothing I can do that it is all his work being done in me. I still want to grow and change and put away childish things. "Work in progress" I commit myself into your able hands mold me and make me Lord.... Lord God Almighty, Savour, Master, Creator of heaven and earth. Help me to love, calm my anxious thoughts, guide my forward steps in your divine purpose, help to be more you and less me by loving my brother and giving to those in need. I ask all of this in the Name of Jesus Christ, Amen!

         I have arrived!!!Wahahahaha!! Today was my first real work day with my new unit, not at all what I expected I can say that much for certain.  I am on camp Las Pulgas which is in Camp Pendleton in California, way out in the boonies.  All there is here is a small store and a gym other than that we are 15 miles away from anywhere. The plus side is I am on the first floor of my new Dorm, the rooms are bigger and the people I work with are pretty cool. They made me the training NCO today, should be an interesting challenge. Training NCO for the most part is a desk job which requires taking care of everyones administrative troubles, as well as making weekly training schedules. My job coming into the Marine Corps was being a switchboard operator which is really interesting to me. The trouble is that I am with an Artillery Battery now, artillery batteries are much smaller and more moblie than the Communications battalion I was with. That means the bulky Comm gear I am used to use I will never touch again. That also means when we go to Iraq I will be much closer to the action in order for us to shell the "terror" out of Iraq.      I have not set any goals for my time here yet, but when I do I will post them here and if you (if there us a you) Does anybody read this? Oh well, (sigh) if you do please read my goals when I post them and check up on me from time to time to see if I am meeting any of them. Oh yeah please pray that i can find a good church and fellowship out here as well as be a witness in my work place. Enough for now peace!!!

         I have learned to be content in all things......Ok, not really things are just looking up in Jamesland today. I wrote the other day about the "breakup" I think I sounded selfish and pitiful now in hindsight, that is the beauty of blogger we can laugh at how serious we take ourselves at times.     The Lord has truly given me peace concerning the decision to just be friends. I think that is because I had the blinders on and wasn't willing to look at reality. The reality is that me and Lydia make good friends but God is just leading us in different directions. Was I willing to compromise with my service to God? It appears I was almost ready too! I am so thankful Lydia was more righteous than me in making this decision.       I know I have been called to be like Jeremiah in his time. We are living in a post Christian time, in a post Christian world. All restraints and warnings from committing evil have been removed, because we as Christians are afraid to tell the truth. Because we have taken on the World's philosophy. Steadily, you can see and trace where we went wrong and where we continue to go wrong.  You cannot tell your coworker that his adulteress relationship is wrong because it is not your business and after all who are we to judge others? Why continue to say peace, peace when there is no peace? The word "evangelical" has come to mean ignorant and bigoted in these last days. I am sorry to say we are not giving them much to work with.... Every group that I work with now seems to be saying how can we get interest in our ministry going? Next thing that happens is the Rock band comes in, the message of the cross is over spritualized and made to be a self help guide.  The draw, or appeal to Christianity seems to be that we have everything the world has music, movies, cool clothes, finacial guides, dieting books the Christian way, And eternal life!!! Why not be a Christian? We have forgotten to be Holy. The people of Isreal spent 40 years in the desert learning the difference between holy and profane amougnst other things of course. They were distinct becuase of thier God first, then the Law, traditions, and unity. They like us exchanged the truth of God for a lie. The wanted a king like the other peoples around them. They wanted fantastic god's of prosperity ones which are easily controllable. We are the same as them therefore our ministry should be the same as the prophets of old. We need to look ahead to the enduring city. You must remember that men love darkness, they don't want there deeds to be exposed to them. So of course there going to be opposed to the cross of Christ.  Men don't try Christianity and find it lacking, they try and find it too difficult.  They hated Christ when he came and they will hate us, let us not become just another choice amoungst many. Let us tell the truth that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. Christianity is exclusive, it is not easy, but it is the right way. "You" "Me" We are sinners, by God's holy standard.  Let us stop comparing ourselves amoungst ourselves. We cannot worry about whether or not our ministry is bearing fruit or not. Our Idea of a good sermon should not be whether or not you felt good afterward. Are we so spiritually bankrupt that only the sensational will draw our attention? We are so desensitized! We see a commercial with starving children on the screen and change the channel thinking "I pay tax money so that programs are set up to help them, I am doing my part." It is not the goverments responsibility it is ours. Where is our sense of outrage at sin? Let us wake up we have been lulled to sleep in the cradle of the world with all of it's creature comforts. We need revival, revival which only comes with a proper understanding of Biblical truth. Where is our Martin Luther, or our Billy Graham? I dare say they are asking this same question. We are, I am ashamed of the gospel, because I both fear and love man more than I do God. "He loved the praises of man more than his God" I do not want this said about me. My desire is to serve God in fear and trembling. I will leave you with this; " I am not ashamed of the gospel, becuase it is the   power  of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile." been reading alot of A.W. Tozer, Francis Shaffer, and Charles Colson lately......needless to say I am a little fired up. Hopefully I have zeal backed with knowledge, this much I must pray. Keep your eyes on the Son....

      Still writing from Oki. should be gone in a week though I hope. Things have been ok here just looking back on my blogs and realize that nothing I write in them reflects how I act during the day. Strange I have a very dramatic flair in me I suppose it is from my drama days. I was reading on Joanne's blog how she said she feels like a turtle on her back. I thought it was funny and also true of my own life. The reality is if it was not for Christ I would continuely be in this same state from day to day.  I feel like I am always running behind, while others with apparent ease waltz through life. I really doubt this is the case but in my worse moments I would like to believe it was so.  Man I can't wait to have my life as a normal person back! Military life is such a hassle I never realized the basic rights which could so easily be taken for granted. I am all the more thankful for them now I suppose so it is a good trade off.  I feel good today and have nothing to write about just putting random thoughts down so bear with me if you happen to read this mess.  Oh well I am done maybe I will write more later.

      Sometimes words from others inspire me beyond what the writer could possibly intend them too. This is the case with the Blog entries from Sandy and Joanne I have just finished reading. Both of whom are in reality strangers to myself save one common bond I find in us all. Longing...... I am not even sure if either one of them would describe what they feel in the same way. I am even slightly ashamed of myself for prying into others thought lives to the find source of their dreams.  Strangely, I find myself at a lack of words, an inability that is a large concern on my heart. How! How do I make known the deepest longings of my own heart in such an open way and not have them misunderstood? Even more, I would be a greater fool and more prone to misunderstanding if I fail to attempt.       Joanne's words touch me deeply, for the desire to rid myself of fear, inadequacy, and the desire to be one with the Lord permeate her words. Sandy's words are really much the same "I want to go home" these words which consummated her entire entry broke my heart this night. because I know only to well......I feel all at once in this blogger the man in Joanne's class asking if the world can see my darkness thanking it, than all the more one who sees beauty in writing and in nature and realizes just how very incomplete I truly am. Only when I am home will all my hurts and pains be vanquished. Only at home will the Mystery of God's creation, His vastness, and all beauty be finally reconciled and realized yet still remain Wonderful.       It is strange that I truly do feel emptied by conversing and being around other people. I think partly because I notice how very far apart we are from one another. Really, If I where to be sincere and speak my heart at all times and others would return the same...Where would we be? Could we really just let our bellies out like that for all to see? I am not sure....One thing I do think would happen is that we would all knowingly and joyfully look upon one another and say......Oh! You have one too!?  As long as we are all equally afraid of the consequences, I am sad to say that I will continue going home after being with my friends feeling a dull emptiness, just knowing that for yet another night I did not live. In the Garden, Adam and Eve where naked not only before God, but before each other and not ashamed. I know that I am seeking this completeness in all my relationships. I wear my heart on my sleeve in so many friendships in the hopes that for a brief moment, someone will notice and I will not be ashamed. I foolishly hope that my best friends, my family, hopefully someday my wife will not be ashamed of exposing there own hearts and together we will understand, I wonder again if such can ever be this side of heaven.        I realize that this longing for intimacy is the reason I read so much because, authors of books are hoping for the whole world to understand them by their writings, they must expose their hearts. In moments of great joy, I truly relate to their intended meaning and no matter who or how long the author has been dead, we connect. The greatest connection ever made in my life came through the Bible...For in God's Word alone are all man's deepest longings addressed and fulfilled. In God's Word alone, is this connection living and active, for God is living and active. God is a God of revelation. When the perfect moment arrives, he comes alive in His Word to us and in these precious moments, I feel the Joy of the Lord. Lord, you said, "It is finished" and this moment I believe and pray others believe also that this is so; you are my Redeemer and my Justification. My deepest joy and my deepest pain flow from you...the mystery that you make known.

      I am 23 years old today!!! God has really blessed me this year my friend Becky and I drove all the way up to San Jose, about an 8 hour drive to spend Christmas with her family. Her family is so kind and made me feel really welcome in thier home. One of Becky's brothers is a super smart guy, Valedictorian of Princeton and a staunch cold athiest. We had a very interesting talk seeing as his biggest philosophic influence has been Niechtze. I don't buy it a second when someone tells me they really believe what Niechtze has to say, I think Niechtze's Nilhism is synonymous with refinement. More for those interested in showing there intellectual prowess in denouncing God with beautiful writings. Speaking with this bright young man made me realize that knowing why I believe is so important.       Late on Christmas day Becky and I drove up to Sacramento where we met up with a bunch of other friends of Becky's. Complete strangers to me made me a birthday cake, hungout and  just treated me so kindly today; I have not deserved any of it. Minuature golf, air hockey, talking about God and starbucks..... I am stoked!  LORD! You never cease to amaze me, every day you bless my life with new friends and fellowship, all after a long trying spiritual drought. Nothing deep tonight just a feeling of thankfulness to God and a renewed hope. I hope everyone had a blessed Christmas whereever you may be......

           I have come to the verge of a breakthrough in my life. How do I put into a few words a lifetime of thought and reflection that took place in single train ride? As in most other cases I will just write and hope my heart can be known; mainly to myself. There are very few events which define my life as I know it so far. I really think that the prayer meeting for North Korea was one such event. Not only did the meeting give me a much needed chance for fellowship, the meeting also gave me a sense of direction in my life. The train ride over I was reading an essay by C.S. Lewis called Lilies that Fester. In which he speaks of how easy it is for pure things to be corrupted. His main focus where issues like; Culture, refinement, and Religion. If our motive for listening to classical music isn't becuase it stirs our hearts to transcendence or at least enjoyment then we are wrong. He means that our motive should not be purely based on attaining some status quo, or being "Cultured", but on truth.      Reading this Essay and going to the prayer meeting in and of themselves could not have possibly been the cause of my breakthrough. I give all of that glory to God my Father for His ability to speak to the heart and answer prayer.  I concluded a few startling things about myself that I already knew, but am now looking at in a different light. One, I do not know myself.....I do not know what it is I am looking for in my life. Has my motivation been to deny my roots to become a man that I could and should never hope to be? Yes! Exactly what I wanted, precisely why I suffer so much. I cannot intellectualize the simple fear of rejection any longer. "SELF" Is an Idea without roots! For me to witness the suffering and attrocities that are occuring in ALL THE WORLD and continue to ask myself what will they think, is this what I want, and other such questions is to buy into a lie. God has reedeemed me from death for more pressing matters. Namely to love my brothers, make right injustices, hate evil, feed and clothe the hungry and naked, take care of widows and orphans in thier distress, spread His Gospel, and most importantly to fear and love Him with all of my heart. I do not want to be a festering lilly any longer. I want to be the same as the rest of creation in showing forth His majesty. Even more....I want to be a Son of the most High God!         I pray now for conviction and devotion, dedication and direction. I want focus in my life, the NK prayer meeting helped me realize that soon I must make a choice and give my life fully to it. I will never be a Renaissance man, but I can be faithful in the calling with which I have been called. Lord have you called me to such a strange ministry? Would North Korea need someone like me? I do not know any answers, now at last I have an Idea of the questions. I am willing to listen....So truly, truly Lord, Your will be done!

      Phew!!! What are relief, I am on vacation now until the 29th of Dec. Then I go to work two days after which I am off another four days. I have to save my money for when I start College that means I am not going home for Christmas. I am bothered by this because like anyone else I just miss being around my family and friends at home. I think unlike others and very selfishly I have a different outlook. I do my time in the Marine Corps the way I would do jail time. You see for me it is easier to just focus on the task at hand. The more I call home and hear about how things are going at home, normally not the greatest, the more I will worry. This is really insensitive right? In reality it is me being concerned more about my own well being than that of my friends and family at home. Well, before I beat myself up there are more practical reasons, the fact that nothing really changes in my life, I have nothing of interest to tell them. It is normally just the facts with my family. It comes down too; "this is what so and so is doing, this is what we are doing, besides that nothing new is going on. How about yourself?" My answer sounds the same "I don't know work is the same, might go to the field soon, I really miss home I love you guys" Maybe all that is needed is that reassurance of being loved and thought about by those you love. I pray for them all in my prayers even my young cousins I hardly see on my stepmothers side of the family. So my issue isn't one of not caring I can not explain why I will just have to hope that someone reading can understand my vague intended meaning, if there is one?       Ah...... My new roommate listens to old gothic German hard rock, or something? I do not know what it is exactly, I will say it is scary. Really, I like quiet background music, preferably Christian music, classical, or Jazz. The funny thing is that I hear so much rap music now that I can tell you every different rappers name and some song (if you can call it that) he or she has. Every man I work with seems to think it necessary for me to hear about all there sexual exploits, on top of that how big of a "player" they are. The fact that I do not want to hear that sort of talk means that there is something wrong with me. I am amazed at how reality is twisted by the media and entertainment.  For now I will leave that an undeveloped thought. I might go travel California aimlessly starting tonight, or at least watch The Return of the King! That I have waited for an entire year to watch. Well Just pray that if you read this that I can be a faithful ambassador to Christ and find good fellowship on Christmas.

      If he could Describe it at all, He would be An artist.  But if he Were an artist, There would be deeper wounds, Which he could not describe.  -- E.L. Masters, from Silence        This I find to be the case with everything all beauty, heart ache,  triumph, defeat, everything..... I think I understand why some poems and some stories can only stir something in you but it is always just out of reach. C.S. Lewis describes this in his book Surprised by Joy he states; "Joy is distinct not only from pleasure in general but even from aesthetic pleasure. It must have the stab, the pang, the inconsolable longing." This pain that accompanies Joy is one of the reason's I came to Christ. In Christ alone does this mystery seem to be fulfilled. In Mathew ch 6:28-30 He point's out a simple lilly in the field, He then proceeds to say that Solomon in all of his glory was not adorned as one of these. After exalting the beauty of the flower in the next breath he takes it all away by saying "If that is how God clothes the grass of the field,which is here today and tomorrow cast into the fire," I can imagine him pulling up a flower and explaining it's beauty in such a way as to bring back the joy of ones first sight of a rose. Only after to cast it away.....The real wonder of it all, is how he expands this glory unto man by concluding; "will he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?" He shows so poignently that nature should be a sign in the road, a marker indicating that the "inconsolable longing" we get from it, is not to be worshipped. In fact it indicates only that we are so much the greater becuase God created it for our enjoyment and His and as a way for us to realize His love.       I have not really left my room in about 6 weeks other than for work and I wonder why I am so depressed. I really miss having fellowship with other Christains. I never realized how essential fellowship is to our survival. I have been convicted while reading Thomas a' Kempis, Imatation of Christ of my selfishness here are the words which did it.                MY CHILD, you should give all for all, and in no way belong to yourself. You must know that self-love is more harmful to you than anything else in the world. In proportion to the love and affection you have for a thing, it will cling to you more or less. If your love is pure, simple, and well ordered, you will not be a slave to anything. Do not covet what you may not have. Do not possess anything that can hinder you or rob you of freedom.  It is strange that you do not commit yourself to Me with your whole heart, together with all that you can desire or possess. Why are you consumed with foolish sorrow? Why are you wearied with unnecessary care? Be resigned to My will and you will suffer no loss.  If you seek this or that, if you wish to be in this place or that place, to have more ease and pleasure, you will never rest or be free from care, for some defect is found in everything and everywhere someone will vex you. To obtain and multiply earthly goods, then, will not help you, but to despise them and root them out of your heart will aid. This,     understand, is true not only of money and wealth, but also of ambition for honor and desire for empty praise, all of which will pass away with this world.  The place matters little if the spirit of fervor is not there; nor will peace be lasting if it is sought from the outside; if your heart has no true foundation, that is, if you are not founded in Me, you may change, but you will not better yourself. For when occasion arises and is accepted, you will find that from which you fled and worse.       I hope the Lord continue's to guide my steps in the way that is true.

      Psalms 71 14 But as for me, I will always have hope;  I will praise you more and more.  15 My mouth will tell of your righteousness,  of your salvation all day long,  though I know not its measure.  16 I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O Sovereign LORD ;  I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone.  17 Since my youth, O God, you have taught me,  and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.  18 Even when I am old and gray,  do not forsake me, O God,  till I declare your power to the next generation,  your might to all who are to come.   19 Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God,  you who have done great things.  Who, O God, is like you?  20 Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter,  you will restore my life again;  from the depths of the earth  you will again bring me up.  21 You will increase my honor  and comfort me once again.

      Geese, it has been a long time since I have last wrote in my blogger, believe me I have tried. I will spend hours at a time trying to figure out what I think or how I feel. There is a pressure I feel to please someone, to get the thumbs up from the world. I am so sick of living my life controlled by fear. Maybe it is apparent to everyone but me that I am lonely and desperately reaching out. Perhaps it is a loneliness that I keep bottled up inside, this is even a part of me I foolishly try to hide from God. I honestly don't know.... I have been saved for four years now, I am still a child. Joanne talks about being grown up in her blogger and how the years move. She was much more articulate and had more meaning to her words. By no means, do I hope to capsulize her entire meaning by my own words. Sandy, reflected upon her life up to this point, as well as brought up many points for reflection. The reflecting I have done is this; I am still a child, I am grown and in fact look very much older than my age but am lacking, I lack on the inside.         I will speak plainly now and attempt some honesty at least with myself. I compare myself with all of my friends from home and abroad and I feel joyful and heartbroken all at once. They have all accomplished so much and are moving in the right direction, they have goals for there lives. Me, on the other hand...... I am turning 23 day after Christmas and where am I? I know such comparisons are not right nor good for me to do, but regardless of whether I type it or not I still do it. So on I go..... I am way behind the power curve. Everyone I graduated with.... Well my Christian friends anyway are done with College and beginning there lives. I have not even begun that phase of my life yet. In fact, I am still licking childhood wounds. I go to sleep everynight feeling a quiet desperation, a nagging pain that never really leaves, but only deceptively subsides. You know I wrote my whole testimony out intending to put it on here. I decided against because I hate to feel that I am pitied by others. All my intellectual pursuits, all my searching, all my life has been my attempt to prove to myself that I am not what I was raised up to believe. Worthless, an Idiot, stupid, not good enough, never amount to anything, your fathers son.......On and on it goes.....This war rages within my heart. I find myself trying to ward off all attackers using my manhood, using the I am smarter than you kind of attitude, everything I do is to this end. Is this my thorn in the flesh? Or is this a pivotal moment in my existence? Lord, My God help me to understand..... Well I must cease this kind of talk, my inadequecy should not be jealously towards those I love. I know the Lord can use me to spread the gospel whether out of envy or rivalry, but I desire it to be goodwill. I desperately want to serve Him! Heavenly Father revive this your servant, help me to be obedient in speading your Gospel. I need a chance to serve you Lord. When you first revealed yourself to me, my heart was broken my pride vanished and only you remained. In these past four years I have been quietly laboring, rebuiding the Tower of  Babel which you destroyed I know now I cannot build this up to you. For it was and is you who makes me to rise in the mornings, it is you who made these dead bones to live again. Your works are beyond comprehension, how far beyond knowing are You Lord. Yet, You have made this heart Your dwelling place merciful, merciful Lord you who calls me friend. I am the least of all men you know my heart. Guide my steps, remove the burden of guilt and unforgiveness and Lord if you choose not too, give me the strength to endure it's onslaught.  Here is a poem from Francis Thompson he talks about God meeting him where he was at and what this experience is......If you do not care for my muddled words please read this poem, I hope it is a blessing to you         O WORLD invisible, we view thee,  O world intangible, we touch thee,  O world unknowable, we know thee,  Inapprehensible, we clutch thee!   Does the fish soar to find the ocean,  The eagle plunge to find the air--  That we ask of the stars in motion  If they have rumor of thee there?   Not where the wheeling systems darken,  And our benumbed conceiving soars!--  The drift of pinions, would we hearken,  Beats at our own clay-shuttered doors.   The angels keep their ancient places--  Turn but a stone and start a wing!  'Tis ye, 'tis your estrangÃƒÂ¨d faces,  That miss the many-splendored thing.   But (when so sad thou canst not sadder)  Cry--and upon thy so sore loss  Shall shine the traffic of Jacob's ladder  Pitched betwixt Heaven and Charing Cross.   Yea, in the night, my Soul, my daughter,  Cry--clinging to Heaven by the hems;  And lo, Christ walking on the water,  Not of Genesareth, but Thames!   Francis Thompson

           Life for me comes in small realizations, These precious moments where I see what a selfish fraud I really am. I say this realizing all of my struggles; I daily battle with lust, laziness, course joking, envy, jealousy, and Pride. Mainly pride, Pride is one that sprouts up anywhere we allow it too. Self-control in the Bible is not the self-control we have come to embrace in our day and age. The self-control spoken of in the Bible is one that realizes that our self is one given over to complete submission, holiness, and obedience to our Maker. The Bible is pleat with scripture to show we are to deny ourselves for His sake by the obedience of our spirit to that of the Holy Spirit. When the word of God speaks of Casting all our cares upon Him, I believe it means to realize our absolute need for Jesus at all times. 1 Peter 5:7 says; "Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you." You see, by refusing to cast our cares upon Christ we are actually affirming our sovereignty. God is a consuming fire, if we labor to build a throne room off of materials we gather outside of Him, they shall be utterly destroyed. Only when we spend our lives building up the Body of Christ and building up the throne room of our hearts using His tools, His materials, and His blueprints. Will we find that the Consuming fire of His Presence finds a Worthy seat in our hearts. Do we really consider it a small doctrinal matter that the Creator of the Universe, not only redeemed our unworthy lives to Himself; He makes our hearts His dwelling place? Sometimes it seems this way.      I was asked today why God does not speak plainly to us, why doesn't he just tell us what everything means? After thinking about the question only shortly I replied; "He does speak to us plainly! I realized at that moment that the Bible is speaking of something so vast and incomprehensible that the only way we can understand is through Allegory and Parable. Jesus employed this method for everyone, in the same way a parent (an honest parent) will use the death of a goldfish to help a small child understand the reality of death. God uses all of creation, all spoken words, and all emotion to express something eternal to us. Great writers understand this well, Dostoyevsky exposed the fraudulence of the humanist philosophies by revealing the sin ridden heart of man in Crime and Punishment. C.S. Lewis explains the Awesomeness of Heaven in the story of a bus ride to it, in the Great Divorce. John Bunyan the depths of Grace in the story of a man on a journey to rid himself of a burden in A Pilgrims Progress. George MacDonald, Madeleine 'L Engle, G.K. Chesterson, are all trying to express the inexpressible through fantasy or mystery. Most of the grand truths these writers attempt to convey are truths revealed to them by the Spirit of God dwelling in there own hearts. Well, I will sleep now hoping to learn more about our glorious Savior in the coming days, weeks, and years. I hope to express the Mysteries of Christ as He makes Himself known to my Awestruck heart according to His will.

         There is a whirlwind of emotions telling of my thought life this past two weeks, in this one instance, in this time of refining, my environment paralleled my own thoughts. I went to the "field" as I said I would in my last post. The field means going out into nature to do training for us Marines. That we did, for eight long and somewhat boring days to master our ability to set up communications on the move. As far as the Marine Corps goes I think riding around the mountains and playing on radios was a success. I learned a lot about how things operate in an artillery unit. The pace is much faster and the gravity of our training much more real. This is because we all know that very soon all our war games in the woods here at home; will be real. On a much more personal level concerning my "Bio's" or work life, I have been dealing with a substantial level of stress. I am in a position where the Marine Corps wants me to be a leader. I have come to realize that leadership is one of the most important aspects of being a Marine. Only there is a slight dichotomy between the ideals of Marine Corps leadership and the actual expectations of my superiors. Justice, judgment, decisiveness, initiative, dependability,  tact, integrity, enthusiasm, bearing, unselfishness, courage, knowledge, loyalty, endurance these are the 14 leadership traits which are ideally what the Marine Corps expects from us. There are also leadership principles as follows:                     Know yourself and seek self-improvement.  Be technically and tactically proficient.  Develop a sense of responsibility among your subordinates.  Make sound and timely decisions.  Set the example.  Know your Marines and look out for their welfare.  Keep your Marines informed.  Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions.  Ensure assigned tasks are understood, supervised, and accomplished.  Train your Marines as a team.  Employ your command in accordance with its capabilities.       Now, all of these guidelines give the impression of greatness or a certain level of integrity in the Marines at least. But this is not what I have seen in my three short years in. I will not go into all of the details for much of trials overcome I believe have made me a stronger man. Much of the trials are to be my reward and I would not miss my reward because of my many carnal inclinatations. I will say that the leadership expected of me is of the "train or pain" kind. Where I should raise my voice and punish for the slightest offenses, as well as teach by micro-managing. My boss has a problem with me asking for other grown men to work instead of ordering them. I will leave my grievance here, at the superficial level, because my pain in this area is already in God's hands. Someday, when I can tell of it all with a clean heart; I will.         I am no storyteller, for if I where I could explain how the hectic work schedule paralleled my own spiritual battles. Humm.... I do not think I sound cryptic only vague, I guess because I can explain with speech, my heart much easier than by writing. I mentioned that the field was somewhat boring. I should have said that when the work tempo slowed which it did when we finished our initial set up at each sight, we relaxed.       During the hard times I made up my mind to give my all to God. This means that during the down time I not only gave my all to God I was able to meditate on who He is. Lying every night in a sleeping bag under the great expanse of the heavens, I was able to think of a life hyphenated by Christ. Full of goodness and purity and honesty and truth and gentleness and hope and love and peace and joy.... and on and on. I am a broken man my spirit submitted completely to His, I cry tears that wash away all doubt and uncertainty, I cry knowing that He knows my steps. The true miracle is the freedom I now feel from my analytical mind. Faith is breathing, being, giving, dying, and becoming one with Him as He is one with the Father.  Jesus Christ, My Lord!      I have always been hopeful romantic, always looking to God to bless me in this area. I wanted a wife after His heart. Yes, I still do.... Now my desire for a wife is pure. I can look at my friends Justin and Megan falling in love and say Amen! I can look at my friends Wendell and Mandy and say Amen! I can read of Sandy's thought life leading to love and find a likeness to my own pursuit and say Amen again to her giving it to God and not having it return void. My giving up is much the same as hers and much the same as my Justin’s and Megan's who unfortunately have never known my thoughts of Joy concerning the purity, honesty, and rawness of there love, because such expression from me would be easily misunderstood. I gave up this past week, I put down my burden and truly picked up the cross.... I do not care about anything but living deliberately, purposefully, and joyful for the Gospel of Christ now. I will be genuinely ME from now on; I will take the course, which I know has always plainly been before me, and give up on a life hyphenated by self and focus on self-mortification. I know this is a long post but if you are willing continue and read this excerpt from Thomas a' Kempis the 3rd book of Imitation of Christ:          The Thirty-First Chapter TO FIND THE CREATOR, FORSAKE ALL CREATURES  THE DISCIPLE O LORD, I am in sore need still of greater grace if I am to arrive at the point where no man and no created thing can be an obstacle to me. For as long as anything holds me back, I cannot freely fly to You. He that said "Oh that I had wings like a dove, that I might fly away and be at rest!"[35] desired to fly freely to You. Who is more at rest than he who aims at nothing but God? And who more free than the man who desires nothing on earth?  It is well, then, to pass over all creation, perfectly to abandon self, and to see in ecstasy of mind that You, the Creator of all, have no likeness among all Your creatures, and that unless a man be freed from all creatures, he cannot attend freely to the Divine. The reason why so few contemplative persons are found, is that so few know how to separate themselves entirely from what is transitory and created.  For this, indeed, great grace is needed, grace that will raise the soul and lift it up above itself. Unless a man be elevated in spirit, free from all creatures, and completely united to God, all his knowledge and possessions are of little moment. He who considers anything great except the one, immense, eternal good will long be little and lie groveling on the earth. Whatever is not God is nothing and must be accounted as nothing.  There is great difference between the wisdom of an enlightened and devout man and the learning of a well-read and brilliant scholar, for the knowledge which flows down from divine sources is much nobler than that laboriously acquired by human industry.  Many there are who desire contemplation, but who do not care to do the things which contemplation requires. It is also a great obstacle to be satisfied with externals and sensible things, and to have so little of perfect mortification. I know not what it is, or by what spirit we are led, or to what we pretend -- we who wish to be called spiritual -- that we spend so much labor and even more anxiety on things that are transitory and mean, while we seldom or never advert with full consciousness to our interior concerns.  Alas, after very little recollection we falter, not weighing our deeds by strict examination. We pay no attention to where our affections lie, nor do we deplore the fact that our actions are impure.  Remember that because all flesh had corrupted its course, the great deluge followed. Since, then, our interior affection is corrupt, it must be that the action which follows from it, the index as it were of our lack of inward strength, is also corrupt. Out of a pure heart come the fruits of a good life.  People are wont to ask how much a man has done, but they think little of the virtue with which he acts. They ask: Is he strong? rich? handsome? a good writer? a good singer? or a good worker? They say little, however, about how poor he is in spirit, how patient and meek, how devout and spiritual. Nature looks to his outward appearance; grace turns to his inward being. The one often errs, the other trusts in God and is not deceived.

           First on to the light matters... I will be leaving for some field training tomorrow that will last for one week. That means I will not be able to have internet access, which is a good thing I think I look here to often to fill a certain void in my heart. Anyways I have fully registered my car now all I have to do is figure out how to do my budget. Oh well, since I already metioned money I might as well make a confession.... I have no sense of financial responsibility at all, I just hope the money is there when I pay my bills. Just wanted to air some more of my apparent flaws maybe doing so will help to change them.       Ok, on to my thought life! I really thank Joyce for the sight with Ravi's MP3 material the "understanding the spirit of our age" lecture by Dr. Zacharias really helped me to see a huge error I have embraced. That is to say my search for self fulfillment and all that it entails. I look back on most of my writing and most of my reading now and don't see service to God, but a quest to understand the longings within me. Honestly, the further I search into my own heart the blacker I find it to be and the more distraught I become. This is because there is nothing good in man. Our natural inclination is towards self, what is better known as pride. Only in seeking to draw closer to Christ (which means denying myself) can I become truly real. I miss many loves in my life, most of them I have never experienced. Strange as it may sound the longings I have within me cannot be fulfilled by always looking within myself. These longings I feel are from heaven, so heavenward I must turn my gaze. I am not home yet that is what I know, this is what I learn fro the Bible. Jesus Christ promises that he has prepared a place for us so let us hope in that.       Here I am! No longer will I feel bad because I do not always feel love, as Sandy pointed out love is so much more than feelings... Joyce is right about Sandy's words you can expand them to all forms of love not only romantic love. The implications of having love for Christ accentuated by those we love is phenomenal! As I have said we only become who we are meant to be by denying ourselves, taking up our crosses and following Christ. Jesus Christ loved the whole world! He died for us who were not deserving of Him! Could we not love in the same way? Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, correct wrongs, or to be more specific.... Forgive those who are in your debt in some way not only financially. Invite strangers over to your home for dinner. If a man asked for your coat give him also your cloak. Heck, you could even tell someone about Jesus and help bring them to Christ, then of course give all of the glory to God.      Let us LIVE for Christ.... We could spend our lives on any cause really, any social issue which vexes us now and our lives would not be wasted, so long as we love our brothers and sisters as ourselves. I desire to draw closer to Him and in doing so learn to love my Neighbor. Pray for me as I will be praying for all of you...... Well my one fan that stops in occasionally.... Unless that is just me checking in from a different computer hehehe oh well! I pray that from now on that God may be glorified through my blogger I am sorry for those of you I may have discouraged in the past. I must also apologize for how unorganized this post is I hope the reader can understand it.

      Well, it is high time I wrote something in my blogger. There is so much I could write about that happend in my short lived vacation. Short lived becuase I know how much I accomplished. I am now the proud owner of a 2001 Nissan Sentra a relative steal 37,000mi, fully loaded for only 7,300 dollars. I have been building and fostering many relationships with solid Christians who are on fire for the Lord. Been realizing more and more my purpose in serving God, as well as coming to a better understanding of the wonderful work Christ has done in my life. I got to see Lupe and Sandy which was cool all the way from Korea, Many of my friends from Okinawa are living in Oceanside. I met the lead singer of Switchfoot you know the one who wrote the music for the movie A walk to remember,  He was a really cool guy and a solid Christian. Well, I am on duty right now and reading This Present Darkness by Frank Peretti (I think that is how you spell his name) I will write more about what it has helped me to realize later right now I better get back to "work".

             7But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. 8We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; 9persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. 10We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. 11For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. 12So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you...  16Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 17For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 18So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. The Word of God is complete, God's word brings me my only consulation. To know that I am to go joyfully to whatever God wills for me is hard at times. All I have to do is remember my thoughts of former days, how sorrow and suffering kept me company in my midnight hour. I have to keep in mind that in my worst moments of sin when I was sure there was no forgiveness. In these moment's I remember "God's grace is sufficient for me, for his strength is made perfect in my weakness." I remember that I carry about with me always the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus might be revealed in me. No matter what trials might come my way I can rest assured in his promises to me "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all."       I like John Piper and his "Christian Hedonism". I completely agree with his thinking, we are commanded to rejoice in all things.  James 1:2 says to count it all joy when we face various trials..." Romans 5:2-4 says "We rejoice in the hope of the Glory of God. Not only so, we rejoice in our sufferings..." Philippians 4:4 says "Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!" Paul's prayer for the Roman church in Romans 15:13 is May the God of hope fill you with "all" joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." Trusting in Jesus is a moment by moment venture. I write these words and I quote these scriptures as one who has no other comfort in this life. Even if I where not to recieve any of the promises made to me, would it not be greater still to be spent for the truth? To say that I lived serving the one true God, there is no higher calling. I accept my pain joyfully knowing that God has my best interest in mind. I know that nothing lame or halt can enter into the kingdom of heaven, nothing impure can enter. So it only makes sense that he is refining me and purifying me in the consuming fire of his presense. All there is left for me to do is moment by moment to lift up empty hands of faith to a God who is there. I was born spiritually, which is important just as my physical birth was important, for without being born I would not have the life I live today. Trusting God that my sins have been forgiven and I am saved is Justification. Once we move on from this point what is important is our Sancification, meaning our day by day, moment by moment reliance upon the finished work of Jesus Christ. No matter how far we go in our Christian faith we cannot outgrow our need for Jesus, In fact I find the opposite to be true the more I serve the more I need him.

      Being tired like I am right now is normally enough to keep me from writing in my blogger.  When I am tired I write about things that are really bothering me... so here goes. In my last post if you couldn't tell the major themes are my own pride and my search for significance. As I stated I know beyond doubt that who I am is defined by the finished work of Christ. What I want to expose is where that line of thinking comes from. You see it seems like most everyone I know is finding there significant other to share in this life with. I am not jealous or angry in anyway, in fact I am joyed by this fact. This does leave a slight question mark on my own heart. I ask myself and God whether or not I am meant to have a wife? I try not to think of it, but in my mind it remains to be found out. Really, I have decided that if I am to be single I will do it for the glory of God, Iv'e decided that he is more than enough for me.        My selfishness and pride come into play is in questions like; am I good enough for a wife? Can I love as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her? In asking these questions I ask myself if I am really seeking God, truly seeking?! I do not want to be in a relationship and have doubts about whether or not I know what love is... I want true love to be an inherent part of my new nature. I want to give of who I am freely not worrying about the returns. I am scared that my love will hurt someone instead of heal. I have seen love used in this way my whole life, (not really love at all) from within my family, I am scared that in some way I might do the same. 1 John 4:18 says; There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.       My doubt, my fear, and anger will never accomplish the righteous life that God desires out of me. Corrie Ten Boom, the author of The Hiding Place when experiencing hardship in the Nazi concentration camps prayed to Jesus and asked for him to take away what she could not carry. For her, it was the anger she felt towards those who held her captive. In the end she realized that those who kept her captive where the real captives.They had on the "man made manticles" of sin which so easily ensnare us. If she did not forgive them she would never be free herself, but she gave this to God for it was to heavey for her. Years later she witnessed about God's love; not only to the former concentration camp inmates, but the guards as well. When I read that I realized that it is not giving up on my thoughts about marriage, and about my issue with pure love, it is giving them up to Christ that is important. If I start to sound like a broken record in the weeks and years to come it is becuase I am a slow learner. I will continuely be saying; "Oh... Lord Jesus, you can carry this too?" as I hand the fragments of my broken heart to my Lord who is able.        I have only had one girlfreind in my life, whom I truly loved, or thought that I did. I remember always being afraid of what books she was reading, and what classes she took in school. I never said any of this to her I didn't want to sound like a psycho. But there remained a part of me that was so afraid that if she spend her time reading secular books that her relationship with Christ would suffer. It only seemed natural that your whole focus should be for the glory of God and nothing else should matter. I realize that I am not perfect though, and in this realization understood that I was being controlling. I never acted on these thoughts of asking her not to be or do certain things at least I hope I didn't. The realization that I thought like my father in this area scared me enough to make me doubt whether I should ever attempt to be in a relationship. Again Lord, I ask you to take this fear from me also, I cast all my cares upon you Lord, this moment I lay all of these burdens down at your feet. Take from me all my unrighteousness and make me acceptable in your sight. I love you Jesus, and I thank you for all of your great and many mercies. Well enough out of me. If you read this please pray that the Lord supplies the strength I need to give all of these things to Him.

           Here is an excerpt from the book 'The Great Divorce' this particular interaction in the book is between C.S. Lewis and his guide through heaven George Mac Donald. A saint of God was unable to convince a man to give up his sin and in the process the man tried to use pity to sway the saint the mans attempt failed.           'even now I am not quite sure. Is it really tolerable that she should be untouched by his misery, even his self-made misery?'       'Would ye rather he still had the power of tormenting her? He did it many a day and many a year in their earthly life.'  'Well, no I suppose I don't want that.'  'What then?'  'I hardly know, Sir. What some people say on Earth is the final loss of one soul gives the  lie to all the joy of those who are saved.'  'Ye see it does not.'   'I feel in a way it ought to.'  'That sounds very merciful but see what lurks behind it.'  'What?'  'The demand of the loveless and self-imprisoned that they should be able to blackmail the universe: that till they consent to be happy (on their own terms) no one else shall taste joy: that theirs should be the final power; that Hell should be able to veto Heaven.'  'I don't know what I want, Sir.'  'Son, son, it must be one way or the other. Either the day must come when Joy prevails and all of the makers of misery are no longer able to infect it:or else forever and ever the makers of misery can destroy for others the happiness they reject for themselves. I know it has a grand sound to say ye'll accept no salvation which leaves even one creature in the dark outside. But watch that sophistry or you will make a Dog in the Manger the tyrant of the universe.'       From this point on the story touches on some very profound points... unfortunately I have to type all of this out instead of copy and paste so I will get on to my point from here.       Instantly, upon reading this I remembered some of the sick thoughts that kept me company in my childhood. The prevelent thought being "What if I where to die, they would be sorry then." (when I felt abused or neglected I said such things) and many other such things as this. I would run through scenerios in my mind of their grieving process at my imagined death and say "serves them right" What really struck me is the fear that I might still do this in my life... although not so blatently. I do think about how my death would affect others around me. Basically the whole need for acceptance, in my case by everyone. The question I ask myself is am I significant?       Believe me I know the answer, I know in my heart that Jesus Christ alone is able to give me significance. People often find their significance in the company of others (comparing themselves amoungst themselves). We find something to lay claim too, a talent, a job affiliation, nationality, race, religion etc. and allow this to be the measure of who we are.  Many of these I confess are very accurate indicators of who we are synthetic a priori's really. I want to probe deeper yet though and expose the error in this thinking. Meaning is always derived from a mind. We cannot know about ourselves truly unless the mind who created us endowes importance upon us. My search for meaning and significance ended the day Jesus Christ came into my heart and life. "We were created for thee, and our heart are restless until we find our rest in thee."  To know that my maker loves me is all that is important. On that day of finality, the day when we shall all stand before Him it will not be what we think of Him; that is important, but what he thinks of me.       The reason I often doubt myself is becuase I am concerned I might not be good enough. The great thing is that I am not and will never be good enough. I am weak I know, but he says; My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness . . . He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.      You see it is acceptance, obediance, and love that are necesary. His grace, His power, our weakness, our waiting upon Him! Humility before the throne room of His presence is the only way.       We who follow this narrow way find freedom in who he is despite our circumstances. Let us lay claim not only to the crown of Christ but His Cross also. A.W. Tozer coined these words in his book 'Of God and Men'  "The man with a cross no longer controls his destiny; he lost control when he picked up his cross. That cross immediately became to him an all absorbing interest, an overwhelming interference. no matter what he may desire to do, there is but one thing he can do; that is, move on toward the place of crucifixion."       Please read this prayer and make it the prayer of your own heart in your walk.       Lord make me an instrument of Thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master; grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.  -Saint Francis of Assisi

      Chances are I will be writing in my blogger a whole lot in the next few months. This is becuase I am a part of the remain behind element of our field exercise. Right now, I am a part of a field artillery unit. That translated into normal language is, really big guns! Personally, I am a switchboard operator that is the reason I am here at the CP "command post" and not doing the whole "shoot, move, comunicate" thing. The Marine Corps has systematically blocked almost every internet site that I enjoy. Well, Yahoo email and www.homestarrunner.com I love strongbad emails. BUT, They have completely missed the blogging domain and right now I am on night shift, which means just me, good books, and a computer all night.       So far since coming to 29 palms I have read Leo Tolstoy "The Death Of Ivan Ilych, Family Happiness, The Kreutzer Sonata, Master and Man" you guessed it short stories. I have not read War and Peace or Anna Karenina yet, although I have made a few futile attempts. I made it through the "The Kingdom Of God Is Within You" in which he states his stance on non-resistence, Tolstoyian philosophy, or theology if you will. Other books I have been able to read at my leisure here are; Pearl S. Buck, "the Good Earth" I found three of her books for 6 dollars at a used  bookstore. I spend about 60 dollars a month on books, needless to say I am amassing a large library. I really enjoy wandering though bookstores seeking after treasures hidden amidst the mundane. My normal companion's in these ventures are Justin, Eric, Willy, or Russ. I digress, Shusaku Endo, "The Samurai" The story is very powerful, I discovered the book in a J-town mall in Los Angeles. He is the only Japanese Christian Novelist I have ever heard of and I would recommend him to anyone. The way he spoke to my heart through the ambitious Franciscian Monk Velasco in his battle against personal conquest and God's will is meaningful to me. In the end through Martyrdom he found peace with God, sometimes I feel this is the only sacrifice that will suffice for someone as hardhearted as myself. Next, on the list is Harry Conn, "Four Trojan Horses" The four Trojan horses are Sociological, Political, Psychological, and Theological. In this book he concisely states how Humanism has made so much headway in our society and under what guises. His contention is that the root of our philosophical despair today lies in the subject/object debate that came from the Eurpoean Philosophers. He actual traces the root back further than Francis Shaeffer who takes it back to Hegel's Dialectic and the abandonment of the antithesis/thesis thinking. Finally, John Stott's "Between Two Worlds" I am amazed at how Scholastic the book is in it's coverage of the history of Preaching, as well as the Preeminence of the word of of God. If you read this please don't hassle me about the whole "Annihilationism" debate concerning John Stott much of which is most likely a misunderstanding, for the most part, the guy is solid I think?        Arrgh.... So I have done it again, I was trying to make my blogger a little more like other people's. By saying things like: I am at such and such place, had a good day, family is doing well,etc. than possibly throwing in a funny story from work, or something that my freinds and I have done or plan to do, to boot. As you can see from the gross spectacle of who knows what above; I have failed. Seriously, I have reread my post from last night and now ask myself. "Come on James, you are not serious are you?" Ouitside of the blogger domain I am still serious about learning, but, more importantly  I am a fairly big dork, I play hacky-sack, chess and ping-pong.  I have an overbearing form of sarcasm that becomes apparent in the form of tall-tales I like to tell in the hopes of insighting laughter. I am an overtly animated person when it comes to story telling, I love using a loud boisterous voice as well as to much facial expression and body language.  I can spend whole nights just hanging out singing praise songs or buckling down for some serious God talk. I really do not like to watch TV at all, although ocassionally I will watch a movie or two.      I really think my freinds are being courteous when putting up with my regular antics, which I affectionately call from Seinfeld "unbridled enthusiasm". I enjoy sitting in coffee shops, but do not like the whole college age group who find it necesary to wax intellectually refined and voice an opinion on every pop subject, by quoting one liner truisms seemingly straight from Dr. Phil.  I am anti-MTV as well as anti-reality TV, which is an area of disagreement between many of my peers who do not see the harm in such stuff. I do not go around condemning people who do watch such things though, but if asked I will tell them what I think. Basically, I do not make my personal preferences a requirement for others you know the law of Moses, law of Christ debate.       Being a man I battle with pride, lust, lonliness, and depression, from my own sin, lack of compassion and  lack of witnessing to my brothers in the Marines. I am very worried about my family coming to know the Lord and have constant concern for what the future holds. I desire to live passionately and unashamed for the Gospel of Christ, but daily fail to even act like a Christian.  I am horrible at keeping in touch with freinds and family and procrastinate horribly when it comes to reading the word and praying. I need you Lord! so much, Lord you are so merciful, I thank you Jesus for the cross. Lord let me serve you sincerely I set all of these my sins before you and ask you to take them from me... the weight of my own sin has destroyed me, without you in my life I am lost...  I desire you more than riches or fame, help me to live for you I ask all of this in your almightly name, In the name of Jesus Christ I pray. Amen

           So here I am in lovely 29 Palms, California, the sign upon leaving the Marine Corps base says; "29 Palms, an oasis of murals".  The one who spoke such words spoke truth, the receipt of which is the cool breezy evenings. It is during these mild evenings that the waning sun seems determined to show forth it's final brilliance, in an effort to ward off the impeding night. This is accomplished in rich layers of orange red hues that expound upon the majesty of the craggy mountains to the north. The before mentioned sunset, coupled with the gluttonous night sky, full to excess of the starry hosts, dawns realization. These remote beacons that have guided mankind upon the high seas from times nearly beyond recollection, are indicators of a glory greater than themselves; a glory that leaves mankind without excuse or recourse.        Strange to me that in my youth I looked up to the ever faithful heavens already knowing that beauty was an intrinsic part of life. Now, as I grow older I find I have to squint to see the stars and the beauty of them I almost have to internally compose. (in part because I lost my glasses) Why now should I have to strive to realize wonder and beauty in life, where in my youth it came naturally? I blame sin, categorically speaking, all sin, original, personal, and all other categories one finds fitting. Am I so deluded that I must have grand rhetoric in excess to appease my need? At times I truly fear this could be. Then I ask... What is the point in lamenting the loss of wonder and by who's definition am I defining wonder? I believe if I am clear enough in trying to state a very vague point, I am defining wonder from the standpoint of a child, without ever stating a definition. Well..., here is the definition according to the dictionary:           One that arouses awe, astonishment, surprise, or admiration; a marvel: ÂThe decision of one age or country is a wonder to anotherÂ (John Stuart Mill).  The emotion aroused by something awe-inspiring, astounding, or marvelous: gazed with wonder at the northern lights.  An event inexplicable by the laws of nature; a miracle.  A feeling of puzzlement or doubt.  often Wonder A monumental human creation regarded with awe, especially one of seven monuments of the ancient world that appeared on various lists of late antiquity.      This brings me to my realization of wonder as a man. God in all of His majesty, glory, strength and loving kindness is wonderful! The more I search the depths of love and mercy of God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit dwelling within me, the more I sacrifice myself for the gospels sake, the better I am able to receive wonder with thanksgiving. The true wonder is expressed here for me; "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.  And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord who is the Spirit". As I contrast the wonder I now behold, with the things thought wonderful in my youth, I realize they are both good.  As I am being transformed into His likeness I am able to see life in a new light. As a child I did not understand what sacrificial love meant and even now only have a conceptual understanding of it. Even this dim understanding is enough to stir a desire to realize experientially "gift love" in my own being. So the wonder I now posses becomes clear in the love between a man and a women, in seeking to understand the rational mind of God, and in the hope that all I do, can and will be for the glory of God.       Just today two events occurred that put a rebuke on my heart. The first was right away in the morning as I woke up the Marines who work under me to get ready for the work day. One of the being PFC Josh Flamez a very good natured young man who happens to be a brother in Christ. He had a attitude problem in the morning to say the least. Normally such would incur the full wrath of an NCO in the Marine Corps, but, since I am a "civilian trapped in a Marines body" I handled a little lighter, which was just a firm warning to change his attitude. This same man young man was found later hiding in between two humvee's (hummer's) crying. When asked a reason why, he said that his parents were getting a divorce. Lesson to be learned from this; be more sensitive and less judgmental. The second happened this evening after returning from a Bible study, I was standing by some of the people I work with still holding my Bible and one of my Marines asked why I was going to Bible study and at the same time talking bad about the "Gunny" and E-7 in the Marines, I am an E-4. He also mentioned how a few days back I had drank a few beers, this I did just intending to be sociable never suspecting that it would cause offense. Mind you I only drank 4 over the course of the day and night, but, I believe the love of Christ compels me to " Let my light so shine before men..." How desperately I need you mercy Lord! I am come casting everything before you, laying all of my burdens down. Lord I believe, yet help my unbelief. Lord I trust, may this trust manifest action. My Wonderful Counselor, my only hope, break this heart of stone so that I may love as you first loved. I ask in faith an obedience to your word, knowing that you are a God who hears the prayers of His people. I ask all of these things in Christ name. Amen

           Phew! I just got back out of the field this morning and worked like crazy while in the field. Uh... I won't even bother trying to explain what we as Marines do in the field, so in the mean time just stick to the whole war movie ideal. I cannot explain anything in writing, I think becuase I am such an animated person well speaking. Here are my upcoming plans for this year...         -Go to 29 Palms, CA till may 15th, leave on the 14th of this month.      -On the 16th of May Drive home to Nebraska, stay for 30 days.      -June 20th go and do some infantry training for Iraq      -Early Sept go to the big sandbox across the sea for 5 months      -March 11th 2005 GET OUT OF THE MARINE CORPS!         Well, I am to tired to write any serious thoughts out right now. Need to go soak in my last 2 days of freedom before the Marine Corps pulls my leash. For whoever reads this please pray that I can keep my focus on Christ alone in these upcoming months. Ultimately He is the only one that matters in my life. Meaning that any TRUE love or TRUE concern I have for what is going on outside my small sphere of existence is based completely upon him. The love that James has to offer is the opposite of 1 Corinth 13. enough God Bless...

      1If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.       Lord my God, you have spoken in the stillness of this morning through Scott, this man whom I cast aside with a hurried theological response many months ago. Not a very good one at that. Never once giving pause to consider from what depths such pain and anger can issue.  Scott, you may never read this entry, but I ask sincerely for your forgiveness.      Now, I commence to a pseudo-defense of my position, although not for anyone else, but for my own conscience sake alone. I have been a Christian for 4 years now and in this short time, there’s been a complete transformation in my life from the man that I once was, to the transcendent bastard child who has found a home. I do not remember if I have ever explained my position on my blogger, for the most part I use this as an outlet for painful moments or pitiful reflection; In essence, what I am doing now. I grew up in a family of imperfect parents. My father and step mother where still to busy living the party life to pay their children any mind. I know my Dad truly laments this fact and desperately wishes he could redeem those years lost. Neglect caused me more pain than anything in my life did.  Like all children, I wanted nothing more than my fathers’ acceptance, or at least his notice. My real mother died when I was 2 or 3, so I never really knew her besides a few memories that I am not sure I haven't completely made up and convinced myself of.       I was the unwanted son, never fully loved, hated for my slowness and always knowing this to be true. The reality is because of generations past and the sins of my ancestors my own father did not himself know love. Although he is still responsible for his actions as I am for mine. I remember with stinging clarity being called worthless, good for nothing, stupid, retarded, even unwanted. Many of these they said in an off hand manner, but there was a level of sincerity when mingled with my inability to perform in school. I was a "special" child never really fitting in, but desperately seeking approval.  For this reason, I became the class clown, performing extraordinary stunts and waxing foolish for the praise of my peers.  There was abuse also; although it was consummated by physical acts at times, the words normally did unrepairable damage long before the hitting occurred.       I found the notice and acceptance I was looking for by theft, running away, and by drugs when I had turned 12yrs old. I spent the ages 13 to 16 in and out of jail and homes, on and off the streets, feeling out of touch and out of control I wandered the way of the lost.  These years were filled with darkness and pain.  I began to hate God and I said, "If he were real he would not allow such suffering, or at least he would not allow me this life so undeserved.” This hatred for the misconception that I knew as God spurred in me an intense desire to find out true truth. When I was 15 and at home, on probation, a wonderful Christian woman named Barb Sayer had compassion on me and paid my way to go to a Young Life camp in Colorado for one week. I remember in my time there how I would go hide in the hills in the evenings as the "preaching" was going on. It was there that a group of Young Life counselors found me and just talked with me. I expressed all of my doubts while they listened attentively and considered their answers. In the end, the statement that has changed the course of my life was "Many of the greatest minds have spent there entire lives searching for answers to the questions you have asked and many of them have come to believe in Jesus Christ." So I searched... although my search was wrong headed, it was as honest an attempt as I could make. I spend the next couple of years diving off the deep end with LSD, cocaine, and any other hard drugs you can think of. In that time, I decided that God could not be God because of evil in the world. Within these drugs, I found traces of something greater, something that would finally bring me fulfillment and acceptance. In reality, I escaped life as it stood, with all of its pain and heartbreak. I contemplated deeply as I could all matters pertaining to life and in the end found something very disturbing to me. I realized that no matter what escapist mentality I held too, I could never escape death. There were various methods but the same awful conclusion, my inability to know and this leap into the dark, struck fear into the very fiber of my being.       Unlike many others, I do not have a clear-cut conversion story; in fact, I believe my acceptance of Christ to be a culmination of many smaller realizations and submissions. In the end, the result is the same. I do remember one event in particular that I can claim as definitive now in hindsight. I was 19 just out of high school and had been reading God's Word for quite some time well continuing in my same sin filled lifestyle. It was at a small hippie gathering in Lebanon, Missouri that I made a confession of faith. It was here that God dropped the scales from my eyes and allowed me to see evil, here for the first time I realized my absolute need for a Savior. I had traveled down in a van with my cousin, but could not go back up with him for I needed time to sort things out for myself. I decided to hitchhike back and use the long lonely miles on the road to Nebraska to reflect upon this newfound need. By God's all powerful and wonderful counsel it turned out my first three rides where Christian men. I remember expressing to the man who provided the last of these rides just what I was not, by covering a long list of things that could not be the truth. After explaining everything that I was not, he asked one pointed and poignant question. "Well friend, if not any of them then what are you?" I paused for a long while. Before I answered, I already had full assurance of this answer. the word Christian danced on the tip of my heart. Jesus Christ was a song within me I knew would take a lifetime to sing. His Spirit assured me that my sins were forgiven, that all things had become new. Jesus Christ called me friend and He called me brother. Finally, life made sense; yes, one fact remained, that in the end: we all die. This question God very smartly answered in His Word. Galatians 2:20 says, “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God, who loved me, and delivered Himself up for me.” Colossians 3:3 says, “For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.”  You see what humanity has realized from ages past has not changed; death is the only way to escape the evils of this world. Everything I tried everything I sought to become on my own power ended in utter failure. I realized that I could not even live up to my own standards (or law) for my life. This is where faith comes into play. Romans 3:21 says, “But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all of those who believe…” Do you understand what this means friend? This means there is nothing we can do, but accept this gift from God. The Word goes onto say, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.” He has imputed His righteousness in us, imparted in us new life; we are born again. Again, Romans 10:4 says, “for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.” 10:9, 10 says, “that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.        At one point in my life this same story I now tell seemed foolish to me, there are times still today when I look at all of the suffering in the world and ask myself if God’s Word is really sufficient to give meaning to the hopelessness I witness daily.  You see, my family is poor; even now, my parents are severely in debt, they about to lose the home that has come to mean so much to us. My brother is in prison and no one in my family has really come to know the Lord yet. most everyone in my family still battles with drug addiction, my sisters struggle with sexual abuse suffered growing up (not from my father) and end up in a string of bad relationships. I know I do not need pats on the back about how my home life, I do not want to hear that is will all be ok in the end. Sometimes God’s word sounds too romanticized to be true. It is at these desperate moments that I must be reminded of the truth. The truth is that I found the world to be the lie first. Jesus historically, philosophically, and experientially proves correct. My hope is not of this world and in reality the world is evil because we choose darkness. Sometimes all I need is the assurance that there are those who will pray, those who will have “empathy” or at least a slight understanding, the very thing I failed to do for Scott, the very thing God allowed Scott to realize ontologically through the love of God pouring out of Sandy. It is a great truth, that only when we learn to love that we can know love in return. It seems God has taught Scott this powerfully through the redemptive love that none of us ever really deserve. "GRACE"         For a long time I had bought into the lie that faith is a “leap into the dark” Which meant to me that it was unfounded and ignorant. This same lie coupled with my striving to prove to the world that I am not all of those horrible names that haunted my childhood forced me into a life of learning. At first, I wanted to know to make others look bad. I wanted to show them my prowess in all things “intelligent”. Therefore, for the past four years I have bought and read hundreds of books in order to become refined for the sake of refinement. In many ways, God allowed me the diligence necessary for the undertaking of such frivolous task, despite what my initial motives might have been. You see, He truly uses us for His glorification and the churches edification. Meaning that what I intended for evil He will surely use for Good. Hebrews 9:14 says “how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve a living God?”   I implore all of you who call upon the name of Jesus to keep looking to the blood of Christ and the cross of Christ for your daily sanctification. Now, I say with a grateful heart “Whom have I in heaven besides thee, and there is none upon the earth I desire besides thee.”

      If letters could blush... I will just come right out and say it, I am not going to Iraq! This morning in order to prepare for leaving all of us Marines recieved our Anthrax and Small Pox vaccinations, as well as constantly being bombarded with "the importance of being mentally prepared for the worst." To top that off we just had a memorial ceromony for two of our fellow Marines from a different Battery who have died in Iraq. A Battery is about 130 people there are normally 5 Batterys in a Battalion thus, 2/11.  So at the COB today the  word was passed that we are now at an operational standdown and are to resume our regular training on Monday. I sincerely want to apologize for anyone who read my last entry, I want you to understand that I was certain we where going, everyone up to my Battalion Commanding Officer CO  thought so. I feel like a real goober I thank you all for your prayers and I am glad to know there is concern for my life and my ministry.  I will say that if my words can help you to realize the seriousness of the situation over there right now I have done some good. Sure we Americans are winning the war. for each Marine, Sailor, or Soldier killed there are about 200 Iraqi's killed.  These are men like myself, yes fighting for a different reason, but none the less more valuable than the choicest diamonds, more beautiful than the most enamoured sunset's. A large part of me was really set on going, I work with some very bellicose individuals who are motivated by the prospect of war. Well, I am happy that I will not go I guess... I should just take things as they come from now on and not say anything till I am on the plane. Through all of this I cancelled my leave to go see my family and go to a good friend of mine's wedding. Told everyone that I would going and now am taking it all back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

           I woke this morning to a humm that nicely acommodates a crowd busy in hurried yet earnest discourse, somewhat in hushed tones due seemingly to the urgency of there topic. The Marine Corps is full of complainers, those of us who are just never satisfied with our circumstances, kinda makes you wonder why such a person would join the toughest branch of the Armed forces to begin with. For all express purposes the rumor mill or "scuttlebutt" as they say in the Marines was grinding out some outlandish commodities for those of us with itching ears. By this hour the bite of the desert air by night had long since ceased and in it's place the blinding desert sun, this selfsame sun that forces the sensible indoors for knowledge that to endure this hessian crucible for any purpose is onerous, arises to annul our cool.       Lying idly on my cot listening to this routine gabber, I was alerted as all others by a change in the atmosphere. The change that took place was one of finalization. There was consensus reached on a subject that has been dwelling as a menacing storm cloud over all our ignorant lives, the issue of going to Iraq. I remember my heart quickened it's pace as one of my superiors quickly dispensed of all the gossip found wanting. "All of 2/11 is going in two weeks, they have cancelled all of our training, let your family know and pack your bags." I sat up in unbelieve, a dumbfounded look upon my face and concern in my heart. 'What, I thought we weren't leaving till Sept?' I said to myself.  After this confirmation  upon confirmation parlayed itself in an acutely actualizing way. That left me no method of recourse, no way to rationalize or laugh away reality. In a few short weeks those stories of distant lands I hear of in the news, the lands I have only read of from biblical accounts, the mounting body count and my own battle with courage will all come to the forefront. No longer, can I say in a sympathetic tone; "how horrible!". No longer, will political talks as to the moral or legal correctness of this war be applicable to me. I will have to be a man for the first time in my life and forget myself. All I can hope to do is serve in a manner that will not bring dishonor to my God and my Country, or cost the lives of my brothers in arms. All I can hope is that through serving in this capacity, I will learn what sacrifice means and I will know what it is to love. What a joy it will be, if at last I can be rid of my childish notions of Love, Truth, Hope, Perseverance etc. I pray to God that His will be done! I hope that he teaches me an effective way to minister to those around me. Already, I can see fear etched in many of the faces of those who work under me. Most are no more than eightteen or nineteen years old, first time away from home and desperastely lost without a sure foundation in Christ or anything else for that matter. I see so many come in only to be drawn down into cesspools of sin. There is an image to live up too as a Marine, not the image you see personified on the TV, but one that corrupts. The image is that of a man with a foul mouth, one who can handle his drink, have his way with women in a reckless and carefree manner and then come to work the next day, work hard and stay true to the superfical aspect of being a Marine; Honor, Courage and Commitment.  Here I stand, I can do no other, yet I am not sure if standing is what is required for these men to come to know Christ? I ask anyone who reads this to pray that God prepares a way for me, as well as watches after all who are in harms way. While your at it pray for the saints who are spreading His gospel to the utter ends of the earth, that they will bring glory to His name. Thank you....

           The fradulence of the human heart,      the deluded lives we lead.      Yearning to be free from misguided passion,      and willed monotony.      New birth,      living water,      hope beyond hope will relieve.      Cruel manacles that bind so tight,      only death bring eternal reprieve.      Lifted up to the height of heights      earth bound to a cross, all for me.      Lifted up on that day I knew.      Lifted up, this day I know!      To call you Lord       and by death;       Be set free.

      Lord my God, be this night my only teacher, teach me all your ways so that I might walk in them. Your disciples put their faith in you upon the revelation of your glory from water to wine;  (Jn. 2:11) I do the same.  How easy it is to fall passionately in love with the truth, yet how hard to express! Jesus, not only teach me your ways, but allow the light you have given me to shine before this world as a testimony to your sacrifice. Make my own life to reveal yours. I Lord do not have the strength, but in my weakness your strength is made perfect. Take this life from me Lord, I want it not. Take my world apart...  Your will be done in my life Lord Jesus. I am so sorry for my sin, I can do nothing without you, it seems my life would be perfect if only I wasn't constantly in the way. I lay down all of my burdens, my hopes, dreams, aspirations, everything. I cast all my cares upon you for you care for me.  I ask you for suffering and reproach in this life Lord! 1 Peter ch.4:1,2 says;      1. Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, becuase he who has suffered in his body is done with sin. 2. As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.        If I seem confused in my most recent posts it's becuase I am... I am trying to live by my strong desire to serve the Lord and subject my own failed battles with sin to Christ. Just this last sunday the pastor of a church that I will not name stepped down from the pulpit. He admitted to the congregation that for the past couple of years he has been carrying on in adulterous relationships with numerous women. How very heartbreaking! How we must watch our steps! Men who read this know my struggle becuase it is so common amoungst us. Jesus deliver me from the body of this death! I don't want to keep fighting a losing battle with lust. I feel as though I will never be ready to marry, never be ready to truly serve until this awful burden is removed from me. You tell me to live by the Spirit and I will not gratify the lust of the flesh, but I confess to you that I can't do it on my own... Lord will you walk with me another mile? I feel as though I am a dog who has turned back to his own vomit, as if I have crucified you all over, like a cloud without rain. What i am you know full well, I don't know why I write my struggles in broad view of all except to say I need help. Lord, I need help! Romans 13:14 Rather clothe yourselves with Christ and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature. Help me Jesus!

          Here is a poem I wrote when I was 18 I wrote it well doing a little hitchhiking in New York. My search to know the truth was in full swing at this time the "hound of heaven" was closing in on me.       Alone I walk through the cold of night      Unknown destination, unknown I walk alone       Onlookers gaze, unattached to what they see      Still I walk on, as life further beckons me            I meet the world along the way      It's many disguises, melodies, and words to say           It's ill intend and best desires      It's original truth that makes us all liars       I wander on so long through these realms long gone      In the beauty realms of nature that give way to Babylon       I search for peace in these cities and valley's I scour      in our quest for perfection it is ourselves and our love we devour       Alone I walk, with God's good word       Alone I walk, never to be heard        When I wrote this I had come to grips that God was out there and thought that i understood Him. I knew he was the God of all creation, but did not yet accept His salvation.  God was allowing me to see how wretched the world was, which got me asking some pertinent questions concerning what is true. He is light and truth and only with new eyes can we see his majesty. I am sure my search, and striving after righteousness even now resemble Billy Madison's construction paper and cotton ball snowman he presented to Miss Lippy. Thank God, I am not getting into heaven based off of my merits.

           Another very late night here at wonderful Camp Wilson in 29 Palms. To be honest I have written and rewritten this same entry about 5 times over the course of the past three days. This is becuase I am not really being honest and honestly, I do not really know what that is anymore. I have made an effort to live my life sincerely for Christ alone even if that means never finding happiness. Then I find myself writing in my blogger as if I needed to please somebody, or be somebody. I wonder if I can even write this entry purely just to put some thoughts down? The second I attempt to write I wonder what will people think, will they notice I am superficial, what if my thoughts are completely ignorant or wrong, on and on it goes until I actually find myself worried about every minute detail you could imagine.       I am in the Marine Corps and I hate it at times but I try to do it to the glory of God. I get out in a year and not really sure what to do with my life from there. I hope God has something extraordainary planned for me, I hope to find fulfillment in all my endevours. I am scared to death of my day to day struggles and am afraid that none of my victories will ever be complete. I am scared of not being loved and accepted, scared of my inadequecies, and scared of insincerity. My life is controlled by fear. Maybe, I will never be good enough for this life, but, I hope that there is one thing that I can do still. And that is be used by God so that others may know Jesus Christ. Forget all of my attempted philosophical rantings and every other attempt at being intellectual. Give me your presence Lord, I am sick of living by fear, teach me to serve, teach me to love. Ecclesiastes 4:4 says " And I saw that all labor and all achievement springs from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind." This is me, everything I have ever done is tainted with self-interest. I know, the whole routine... Yes, God can use even what I mean for myself for his glory. But what is the point if I can't live completely for Him? I need to have all of Him and none of me, I will not settle for anything less. If I can't know Christ and the fellowship of His sufferings, if I can't give everything that I am without always worrying "Who am I doing this for"  what is the point? Everything, will be burned away in the end, every work that was not of Him. I need assurance from you Lord that I am a new creation! Why must I always live with this nagging doubt? Where is my conviction at? Conviction is the state of being convinced, and assurance the state of being sure, by adequate evidence or arguement that something is true.  I know your word is full of comfort and assurance Lord, You say "Do not let your hearts be troubled..."  you know the plans you have for me... you tell me your compassions are new everyday... you tell me to let tomorrow worry about itself.... You give me the witness of the saints, the faithfulness of the sunrise, yet I doubt! Lord, you truly are patient, and kind, and loving, and everyother good thing I can attribute to you. It is truly profound that you had Adam name all of the plants, animals, and creatures becuase, we still do it today. Not only do we label and catergorize creation; we attempt to do the same to you. The beauty is that there is no limit to your glory. What a joy to spend our lives, all of eternity even, just finding out just who you are, then finding out that you are so much more. I have faith in who you are Lord, yet help my unbelief. Have your perfect will done in my life, cast away all of my fears. I love you Jesus! for you first loved me. You loved me despite myself and I thank you for that.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you,  my only love..........

           This past week there could be little to nothing to separate me from any other average joe. I read my Bible maybe twice and hardly picked any others books as I usually do. I spent a lot of time hanging out with the people I work with playing pool, telling stories, joking, and wrestling. In the midst of all of my business God did something miraculous! He stayed in my heart despite my lack of bible reading and despite my lack of beating myself up over my sin. I can not attribute what has happend this past week to anything other than the Lord moving in the lives of His children. Both mine and those who are coming to know Him. I have recieved the chance to share my full testimony, tell the Gospel story, counsel others about there relationships, stress to them the relevence of the Christian faith using apologetics, and just learn to love them and meet them where they are.       It is not about me! Jesus thank you! This is so big in my life, perhaps one of those life defining moments. Sure in the grand scheme of things this is just another mountain top experience, but I have learned to recieve such experiences with joy and am learning to embrace the "Valley of Humiliation" with a willing heart. I don't feel like writing using proper grammar or spelling, I don't feel like trying to sound deep. I just want to share my joy. Being a Marine isn't that bad when you do it to the glory of God.

      Walking with your word in my heart, I decided not to stop. I walked past the familiar faces and places, once held dear. Looking now with different eyes, I seen; pain pouring out of every stereo, confusion in the young, and bitterness in old age. I walked on praying, "Lord let me know you, let me find you at last!" I walked past the ceasless day by its unnatural light, down the man paved roads to a young and starlit night. I followed till the noise of nature, replaced, drowned out man's clutter. Straight faced and solemn I continued on, Your highest praises I did utter. "This time I will not return, this life will not know me, but you!"  The birds of the field are fed and each day Your mercies are new. Why should I ever worry knowing the lillies lot. What pain or fear could grab me knowing Your will is sought. But the night grew thick and my feet grew heavy, hunger stabbed with effective knives. Still a man, hopelessly caught by need that seems to plauge our aestetic lives. I lay down beside the road to rest my weary head. Hunger, fear, and wants, replace my sleep instead. Falling, turning back, chastised by the cold air, the fragility of my frame and weakness of my flesh, I seek, but no longer Thee.  Frivolous is this faith when what's free is conditionally and foolishly composed by me. I fly fast now, my selfish wings unfurled to the night sky, seek safety, O' World is it you, who by indulgence can set me free? I fly to my perch in the same unnatural light. Outside remains still, the dark and cold of night. The familiar faces and places remain yet to greet me. The same pain, confusion, and bitterness, I still with different eyes, must see. Prayer prayed not forgotten, fell on Your listening ears. I then shut off the painfilled music, spoke wisdom to the young, and cried for peace to those advanced in years.

                   It is 5:40 am now, my shift for SOG (Sergeant of the Guard) ended nearly two hours ago and for some odd reason I am still awake, despite my lack of sleep the past couple of nights. My entire mission consist of: Ensuring Marines are not sleeping on thier post, ensuring they have accounted for all of their gear, ensuring they wake up on time, making sure they have food and water, their morale is high, and finding out if they have any health or administrative concerns. I also report any unusual activities that occur outside of the firm base to the Watch Officer. (watch the movie "Fire Base Gloria" in order to understand what a firm base is.) I really enjoy being a quasi babysitter to grown men. I realized tonight that I can use my position to really minister to those I work with. When someone is forced to stare down the barrel of a .50 caliber machine gun for four hours with no t.v., magazines, or music to keep them company they are left to their thoughts. So far I have ran into a couple different kinds of people. 1. Those who apparently do not think of anything. 2. Those who only think of their great many exploits. 3. Those who are angry with the world and want to tell you about it. 4. Those who have concerns about their families or need someone to unload their thoughts on. "disclaimer" My categories do not accurately reflect the general populace.       My favorite role upon walking my post is that of a counselor to those who are downcast. Being a Marine is not a very easy job. All of the "freedoms" we fight to defend, we Marines are completely denied ourselves. Lack of freedom, stressful work environment, being away from home, and thoughts about Iraq really get to some people. What makes matters worse is most of these young men are more concerned about how there mothers are handling all of the news. That means that you Parents out there have to grow up! Stop giving your son who is about to go to combat more to worry about. While concerning being a counselor I found that just listening and trying to understand their depression will do a lot. Moreover it gives me an excellent opportunity to share with them who I look to for consolation. I explain how accepting Christ in my heart means realizing that the God of all creation, the very God who gives life and light liberally to all, is the Same God who became flesh and dwelt amongst us, the very same God who died upon the cross to save us from death and sin. This same Jesus Christ promised to send me a comforter, this same comforter is this same God of all creation dwelling now in my heart. This same God, Triune in nature, hears my prayers, sees everything I do and loves me despite myself.  I am able to share with them my background and why it is I understand depression. I share how knowing the God that gives all men life will never leave me nor forsake me and knowing He has promised me eternal life is enough to bring me through anything the Marine Corps can throw at me.  Starting to get sleepy now....

            Jesus, I am not sure I live up to anything written in your word. I am not sure I have ever felt the power of the Holy Spirit in my life. I don't think I have ever trusted you enough to really take a step of faith. Maybe I have never felt, never experienced the reality of being born again. Maybe I just don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Maybe I just don't know how to give my life to you. Perhaps coming to you has always had me in the lime light. Have I selfishly accepted you because I want to be blessed? What am I doing? Where is my ministry? How have I left anything to follow you? Where is my confidence? Where is my boasting? Why is it that only when one is on their death bed do we realize the immense weight of eternity, the truth about our eternal souls and our need for a Savior? What words of consolation can we offer those who grieve knowing that there loved one is most likely in hell? That is reality, not everyone is going to heaven. What can the prayers of a guilt-ridden, sin-ridden, selfish man like me do? What if I where to boldly say that I know all of the scriptures you could use to comfort me. What if I where to say that my only hope lies in those same scriptures. What if I where to say I am lonely and feel, the only thing that is real in my life is this. I don't feel the love of the Holy Spirit bringing me comfort and assurance. I don't see the needs of the sick and dying being met by me, the one who should be pleading there case. I want to be real! I want to be genuine! I want to walk away from all I know, share in your sufferings, live for you! Serve you! Love you! And be with you always... But, I don't know how to be sincere, to meet peoples needs, to feed them, clothe them, comfort them. Show me the wretchedness of my sin Lord only in contrast to the fullness of your Glory. You are glorified Jesus, you sent your comforter and have prepared a place for me. I pray Lord that you make this real to me and help me to make it real to others.       I wrote last night in a desperate moment these painful words, I wrote because my life feels out of control, my love seems insincere and my faith manufactured at times. Today upon rereading my own words I was struck by something. Struck by the fact that I pitt everything on my ability to succeed, my ability to serve, my capacity to love God, me, me, me. Sure my prayer/plea sounds most earnest and perhaps true in some sense. I am not serving or living in any way close to the way those in Bible times did. My walk is of course completely me centered at times and for the most part I don't feel God's presence bearing down on every aspect of my life. But there is another reality I have completely neglected, the core of the Christian faith. Jesus Christ is Lord! He died for me! He covers my sins! He is the one who will plead my case! He loves me and doesn't see me now; He sees the finished product. His blood HAS washed me, purified me. His death HAS set me free from the bondage of my sin, He HAS delivered me. He will give me the words to say, He will lead me into all righteousness. Jesus you are my Lord, forgive me for trying to make you into nothing more than something to help ME along MY way. Take control of my life, the throne room of my heart is yours, I ask you to adorn it in accordance to your liking. I am weak, broken and not able to fix myself. I commit all of me to all of you, have your perfect will done in my life. Be my Lord... Jesus Christ be glorified through my life as I stand on all of your unfailing promises. Lord God according to those promises I ask you to see the brokenness of Scott's father and in that brokenness to call him by name. Lord that he might be known by you! Heavenly Father you conquered death and sin because of your great love for us. We pray in all earnest that you open His heart to know you, to seek your face and see your glory. How majestic! How powerful! How worthy of all of our praise are you Lord! Not only Scott's earthly father but, my own. There is no to late with you Lord. I ask believing that you are our High Priest.  7"During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. 8Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered 9and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him 10and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek." I ask according to your promises; 11   "And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12   He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 13   These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 14   And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: 15   And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him." Lord hear our prayer

           I will just come right out and say it, I am growing a moustache. Yup, I know there are many, many loyal fans out there who have been desperately waiting to hear this news. This stache is dedicated to all of you Magnum P.I. fans out there. I am hoping for a moderate balance between Tom Selic and Burt Reynolds on this one. My prayer in all of this is that, the end result is not some sparce, scant teenage moustache, or a fu-man chu; only time will tell.       I haven't wrote in my blogger for a while mainly becuase I have been resting so much that I am afraid I have nothing noteworthy to tell about, until of course, my grand epiphany with the handlebar stache I am banking on tumbled out of my childish mind. Other than that I am just chillin in the desert spending a lot of time reading the word and a variety of books. So far this past two weeks I have read Treasure Island, Robert Louis Stevenson, Hard Times, Charles Dickens,I, Issac Take You, Rebekah, Ravi Zacharias, The Aeneid of Virgil, and right now am making my way through Pride and Predjudice, Jane Austen and Civilization On Trial and The World and the West, Arnold Toynbee, then finally The Gospels and Acts in the word. Needless to say I have a lot of free time on my hands.       I have not been my usual self lately, as far as my constant self doubt is concerned. This is a new place for me. I feel a certain peace in my heart about life in general that makes me a little uncomfortable. I have decided it best to call it a blessing from God and just accept my time of rest by keeping a peaceful mind.       If there is a common theme that I have cogitated, or pondered on through the reading I have done, it is the value of devotion. The devotion to duty, or (dooty) that one of the hands aboard the Hispanolia, sp. Tom displayed in being willing to lay down his life rather than mutiny with Long John and the others. The simple honesty and quiet perseverance of Stephen Blackpool as well as the Love and devotion of Sissy in Hardtimes. It should go without saying, all of the valour, courage, devotion, love, and sacrifice so beautifully displayed in the Aeneid was inspiring and educational. Ravi and I go way back... although I don't think I agree with him in all areas I enjoy his personality and heart for the Lord. Did I mention his rappier wit? His book gave me a few more truisms about relationships to spout out and I guess it did reaffirm the fact that relationships are difficult and invovle compromise and all of the same things everyother relationship book says about communication and what not.       Me and relationships I don't see ever really mixing. Of course like most others I hope that I will find the right one and live happily ever after and what not, but as long as I am still me, I don't see it happening any time soon. I suppose looking into the facts to much has not helped at all either. I found the number one cause of divorce, Christians included, is finances, number two is communication, I am deficient in both. This is only two out of about a million reasons I use to convince myself I am not ready. Others are:  1. I need to desire God first then the rest will fall into place. 2. I am ruggedly individual by nature. 3. Based off of my family background a relationship is guaranteed  to be 10 times harder. 4. I am an extreme introvert 5. I don't understand women in the least 6. Again, I definitely am really bad with money 7. I think I am the jealous type, although not the psycho kind. 8. I don't think my plans right now include a significant other. 9. I am a card carrying member of BTR (Bachelor Till the Rapture) and would be required to undergo severe ridicule and beatings from the other current members in order to be disenfranchised. Well the list could go on but it becomes more specified from beyond #9 so that will have to suffice for now.       This is a funny story.      I work for a 35 yr old black man, Gunnery Sergeant Beynen. Anyway, he decided that he wanted us to brainstorm to think of an idea for a T-shirt for our section. So being diligent Marines myself not included, my comrades brought out a plethora of ideas not sparing any sexual innuendo's of course, which I will forego the specifics of for decencies sake, but must mention the shirt "decided" on for humors sake. After long and careful deliberation in one of our staff meetings on the subject my Gunny said. "Yeah, those are nice ideas, but, here is My vision. Picture a big hand in the middle of the shirt and one the top it will read, make sure your pimp... and the bottom will read, hand is strong." It was then decided by my Gunny that the hand would obviously be a black one, on account of the fact that he in his own words is; "a beautiful black man." My initial reaction, dumbfounded silence. My current reaction, dumbfounded and annoyed to sarcasm. What is he thinking! that is the stupiest shirt idea I have ever heard of! Does he expect me to where it? Am I taking crazy pills here or is this not cool? I will take a moment to explain this man in a little more detail from my perspective. He is really task organized, very efficient when it comes to work, a neat freak, perfectionist, and prone to micro-managing. He makes a conscious effort to improve himself as a leader and attempts to be lighthearted at times. Over all, I like his work ethic, don't mind his personality, but am afraid of him and think he hates me and have a hard time working with him on account of it.      That pretty much sums it up for now, I will write more later.

      Over the course of the past few months I have been burning a whole lot of midnight oil. Many nights I spend sitting idly in front of the computer screen searching for blogger's and Xanga's that resonate with my own heart. I spent a little time before I sat down to surf the net and considered why I do this. I refuse to go over the externals as to why I spend too much time surfing the net, I will go straight to the heart of the matter. I am looking for acceptance in the online world... looking for someone to validate my thoughts and Ideas. Someone to encourage, rebuke, agree, or deny me. All of this fruitless searching in order to supplement my time with the Lord. I also have some great freinds. My freinds Willy, Russ, Milo, Pete, Renee, and Becky are ssome I spend time talking about who God is, who Jesus Christ is, who we are in Christ and how that relates to the World. I have decided that I will not allow myself to surf the net or hang out with my freinds until I have spent time in the word and spent time with the Lord in prayer. Jesus Christ alone can fill the void in my heart... all other relationships, to include best freinds, or even spouses will not fill the emptiness in the heart of man so much as God.       Holy Father, Lord of my life and Savior of my soul, I consecrate my life to you today. I pour out my life as a drink offering to you my King. The blood of your Son draws me nigh Lord and keeps me so. I do not know where to go, but I am ready, Lord send me. How to adress the pain, how to be a light in a dark place? I do not know... Lord I ask, your will be done and you be glorified.

           I awoke last night letting out a feeble cry for Jesus to help me. I remember trying to form the words many times well I slept, this well the feeling of many hands holding me down taunted me. I could not break free, but I could dream... In my dream I ran out my door into the courtyard of my dorm only to see all of my possesions recklessly tossed and torn everywhere. While I was examining the remains of my ID card I looked up to see a large lizard the size of a Kamono sp. Dragon stalking towrds me. All the while there was an evil laughter in my head. I felt as though I had lost all control of my mind, as if it was being taken apart while I sat and watched it all happen. It is hard to explain this feeling of complete insanity... I have not felt so desperate for many years. If any of you have ever had a bad acid trip before you could relate to the feeling of losing control. When I finally woke up and cried "Jesus help me!" I felt as though I had won a great battle, I was scared and had to read a few chapters of the Bible to help me sleep. Not that it mattered which verses I read, the Bible was used more as a crucifix to ward off the vampires then anything.

      I have to wake up in two hours, but right now that does'nt matter. What truly matters is Knowing Jesus Christ. I spent the last 5 hours with my dear brother in Christ talking about everything. Russ is a radical Christian in much the same way I am. There are convictions that must be lived out in both of our lives that we spent time in passionate discourse, prayer and tears over. I have to change.... I realize that what makes me laugh and cry tell God much about my heart. So why listen to music that is obviously promoting pride, the same with movies that promote everything self-oriented? Why do I substitute caffine for sleep that I should normally get? Why do I substitute surfing the net, pornography, movies, and other books for time spent with God and His word? What is with these 8min ab videos, and diet pills, breast implants, piercings, tattoos, sugar free, fat free, low carb, abortions, birthcontrol, penis enlargement, on and on.... Everything becuase we are lazy and fools, entire industries,peoples entire lives spent on fulfilling our wants. For what? So they can make enough money to fulfill their wants in return. Thus whole cities founded on sin. Mankind outside the Mercy and Grace of God is in rebellion and desperately lost. Much of what we call "worship" is nothing more than sensationalism. The reality is that I could sing any song verse 20 times in a row and experience a euphoric feeling. So why do we conclude that is the Holy Spirit? I could hire a hyponotised to come to the church for a day and speak persuasively and cause people to fall over in place or laugh uncontrollably, but that does not mean it is the Holy Spirit. I often wonder what the appeal to Christianity is these days? Have anyone of you seen those retarded " not of this world" bracelets, or the necklaces that have a nail on them, or the generally fashionable crucifixes you can buy now? The Christian music that is cool just like the world's music? Christian books on leadership traits instead of on traits of a follower? Satan has so man tools with which to decieve us. We must remember he is the Father of lies who can masquerade as an angel of light. Satan will give you a lake of truth to hide one pint of poison. Why do women all have to expose their middriff or what ever they call the stomach region now? as well where pants that are so low you have to have a bikini wax to where them. That along with all the time in tanning booths, makeup and perfume.... Guys you are definetly guilty of all of this too... In all of this I am expressing some thoughts that pass through my mind, of course I do not go around telling people they are wrong and I am right. Perhaps those who do such things are strong in their faith are simply practicing the liberty in Christ? Much of what I wrote about I write as a challenge to Christians to try to live holy and set apart... I don't wan't to call unholy what God has called holy so feel free to rebuke me for my error....

           Spent much time over the course of my years in anguish concerning many issues. The most pressing of these issues being my sin contrasted with the holiness of God. I discovered a few startling realities upon seeking God's face. I found that my sin is not really the important issue at all. Jesus Christ died for my sins and my trust in that fact is enough. I noticed that often times I sin on purpose in order to feel anything at all, feeling the shame of my sins honestly feels better than nothing at all. This is bad only becuase as in all instances in our walk it is an indicator of my lack of trust in the Lord. Answer, realize that even my anguish over my lack of faithfulness is me trying to affirm my sovereignty in my life. All I can do is cliche as it may sound to some is constantly, daily hourly, by the min. give my all to Jesus.        It seems to me that we as Christians also do not understand fully what it means to be a Christian. What I mean is that we tend to look at things in a fragmentary manner, instead of as a whole. We look at the War in Iraq as bad, the break down of the family as bad and "Tolerance" as bad. We see God as Creator of heaven and earth, Jesus as Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit as living in our hearts. What we all seem to fail to apply, is these facts, to the whole of reality. If Christianity is true that means it is the only relevent Worldview. It means there are really only two ways to look at life. One is from the Humanistic perspective, the other Through the lens of Scripture. We must see Gods providence in every moment, contrasted with man's rebellion. There is in fact a great unbridgable chasm between the two. There is only one form of goverment ever to reflect the true nature of life accuretly, the kind based of off a Judeo-Christian tradition. Only in Christianity can there be a LEX REX form of goverment that does not have a sujective base, only in Christianity is man fully man. If you take the thinking behind abortion and follow it to it's logical conclusion you find life loses all value, if you trace Neo-Darwinism and trace it back to it's logical base you find it never has had value. In such a world who can fault Adolf Hitler or call Him unjust? Who is there to distinguish between right and wrong? Other than the powerful. Democracy fails to be democracy when conquest for democracy becomes tyranny to the "liberated". We cannot set up democracy in a Goverment without a Judeo-Christian backing becuase it will ultimately turn to a dictatorship. Those of us in America will soon learn if we have not already, that to free yourself from the shackles of the Divine is to bind yourself to the natural and and Carnal. In the name of freedom we are being stripped of every right we once held dear... and why? Becuase we have taken God out of all life and are now finding the only available replacement on the market is man. We as Christians need to see Christianity as TRUE to all of life. We need to act as if it is true in all aspects and fight on all the fronts at once. Political, Theological, Philosophical, and Sociological, as well, realize the Spiritual implications of such a War.

      God is so much bigger than even our deepest sentiments. No grand rhetoric, finite platitudes, heartfelt homiletics, aestetic reasoning, or romantic verse can come close to describing the greatness of God. We get so caught up in what holiness should look like, what perfection should be that we forget to examine the life Jesus Christ lived while in our midst. We forget that he rent the veil and through Him we have communion with the Living God. God is not only in a feeling, not in a moment, not in a way of life, He is all in all and will be Lord of all. This all to say we do not meet Christ only in small moments of clarity, or pious images of kneeling before him. Yes, you will find him there, but you will find more self service in this place than anything. You will find for yourself rivers "humility" in such moments, but this is not it. Jesus Christ is Lord of all is even in the monotonous moments, in our despair, and in our deepest of loves. It is here you will meet the Lord, we cannot run, I cannot go to a monastery to find peace. The Cross is central in the Bible for a reason. In fact we learn in the word of God that the Son learned obedience by what He suffered. We learn that Jesus Christ layed down His divine power and humbled himself even unto death on a cross. Willingly! Why do we strive for so much and make so many goals outside of the Lord. Don't tell me what you want to specialize in, how many kids you want to have, what your perfect vacation is, who the perfect mate is, how much money you want to make, what your dream car is, what you want or deserve. We deserve death. The world is desperately sick! Everything is wrong! All the cities all of the T.V. shows, all the music, the way we dress, the way we joke and the way we murder. All out of pride. Guilty, we are all guilty. I don't know about you but unless I am reading a different Bible we are called to conform ourselves to His image, to take up our crosses and follow Him, to basically do what He did. He came as a light and He tells us we are a light. He came to show forth the Fathers love and tells us to do the same. I am not buying any of this doctrinal fiasco anymore. Am I pre, mid, or post trib, dispensationalist or covenant theologian, am I a cessationist or do I still believe in the gifts today, is baptism required or is it not, am I Calvinist or Arminian? There are so many more... As we debate these issues the goverment is taking over our job of Charity, the tv is blaspheming and promoting liscentious living and we call it entertainment, people are dying by the thousands we we talk of economic and social reform. Time to wake those who are sleeping, set free those who are in the bonds of sin and know Christ by being like Him in His death.

      Tomorrow is a heavy load Lord when I carry it all on my back. Remove it from me Father so it's contents can be cleary seen before my eyes. My future as well as all of you, is the same as peering into the cloud of unknowing without the Son. Thankfully, the veil has been rent and the clouds parted at the consumate revelation of who You are through Jesus Christ. Help me in being Christlike by conforming myself unto His death that I might be found alive with Him. I am riddled with doubt Lord even so I have none other besides Thee. Cast down my high places clear out Your temple of all it's impurities as you did of old. In Your immutable Spirit zeal consumes like the glory of your brilliant presence burns. Lord, I feel the cold breath of the void, I see the brambles growing round to cut me off, if you do not rescue me I shall surely die. Redeem me from the depths once again if it be Your will, for Lord I cannot breath, nor see except by You. Your will and law are my delight, just please make your victory a reality in my life. I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen

           Thank God for weekends! The time here is 12:32pm and I just woke up maybe 20min ago. I have never had a better opportunity then now to write a little something about what is up in my life. First off let me mention, one of the reasons I write so little anymore is becuase of a conviction I have had concerning my own words. You see when I really take time and read over some of my post I realize just how temporal and unrelated they are to the reality of where I truly am. What I mean to say is the words written speak volumes for the moment but very little of the condition of my heart. I am a Christian "Little Christ" and on a day to day basis I put my unrelenting faith in this knowledge and strive to live for our Lord knowing His proximity to my own heart. I am frankly sick off writing in my journal all of my frivolous doubts and fears that pass with the rising of the new sun. I am tired of looking back and regretting my words wondering whether I am doing an injustice to the Lord by them.       I suppose what I really want can never be achieved in this life time. I want to write something meaningful, words that capsulize the heartbeat of our Christian faith. I desire to be relevent to this world, for my walk and witness to make an impact, to be holy, set apart, and a royal priesthood. I believe if my words ever were to Crystallize they would loose all of there social significance. Perhaps the power of the word of God lies in the fact that it is living and active. Lies in the fact that it remains permenant and transforms the heart. Although, the bible is just words on a page, just a book, we can't but marvel that it remains yet today as a staple for history as we know it. We cannot overlook how these words on a page illuminated by the Holy Spirit are able to transcend any purpose we can tag onto it. The only limitations we can place on God and His word are those He Himself placed on Himself. If you are reading this I hope you are enjoying the ride...       On another note, I went with a couple of friends to a Christian techno house down in San Diego last night. It was techno music with scripture flashing on the screen so that as you danced you could read the word of God. Ummm... it was a little different. I do not dance but I tried it out anyway, I felt something like charlie brown. This girl I went their with Denise told me to simply find a beat and follow it, which sounded like great advice at the time until I got their. Well, it turned out to be me mercilessly attacking the air with a barrage arms legs and hips in an attempt to follow every beat at the same time. All in all, I loved it!

      Same as usual, have tried many times to write sincerely as possible in my "online journal" but always delete whole pages at a time afraid of my own thoughts. I am so envious of people who go through life and can just have a routine. I read my bible now, go to work now, write now, etc. etc.      I wanted to write in detail about what the Lord has been teaching me, my time at home on vacation, my friends wedding on and on. But that is not me... I come on here when I can't sleep. When my heart is heavy with petty cares. When I just need...      Why was man still lonely after he had named all of the animals when he had God? Why can't I kill this desire in me that desires companionship? I try... My number one desire and goal in life is to give my life in the Lords service. I TRULY TRULY believe that to live is Christ and to die is gain. I have been speaking openly about God to all my coworkers, but then forsaking my own studies. I am seeking after balance. I have come to a lot of conclusions about my motives in many things in life. 1. The way I choose friends is based on what they can offer me and not how I can serve. 2. Most of my goals I strive to achieve are to in the future to set myself up for being a more eligable bachelor. 3. I am still even after all of this time foolishly hurt from my break up with my last girlfriend. 4. I have decided to finally give all of this up and live for God. I will to be eternally minded, forsaking all that is behind me casting aside any desire that is not glorifying God. Learn what it is to obey, learn what it is to love unconditionally, learn what it is to feel compassion. Lord be my strength!!!

      &nbsp; Fighting back a surge of emotions, holding back thoughts and feelings that flee with times intensity. There must be something in this hornets nest that can be drawn out, that can be expressed and articulated. My mind is a&nbsp;torn net catching up the refuse of a broken levee, pouring over the landscape of my city of flight. The words cascade recklessly down, reason breaking reasons founded on sand. Truth covering, Truth saturating, Truth filling and settling down on my home.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This house that sin built, canopy covering the sky, blocking out the Natural light, so that what has life must die. I did not build, but inherit, this rich city buttressed by pride. Generation after generation has cursed their father for their toil, yet all built and all died. All work to build their kingdoms, sovereign lords in a land of shadow. Sovereign lords with but one&nbsp;Transcendent foe.&nbsp;Generation after generation cries out in my heart, I cry too.&nbsp; Cursed men, working on cursed lands, for cursed gain never see their work through. &nbsp;Must I walk in my birth fathers footsteps, must my lot be an addition to this misshapen maze, megalomaniacs monstrosity, a teetering&nbsp;expression of the man's majesty.&nbsp;Always supported by another false wall, our proverbial house of cards&nbsp;crafted&nbsp;with shaky and&nbsp;uncertain hands must fall.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sapiently savage, diametrically at odds with mans soundness, we call You a fool.&nbsp; Your floodtide is gasoline, your word a consuming fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock of Ages, could cause a spark, to ignite the&nbsp;funeral pyre. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Burn away, the canopy that blocks out the Sun, Burn away the old city to which men often run. Burn away all of me till Your will alone be done.&nbsp; May this&nbsp;smoking sacrifice&nbsp;rise up a fragrant scent to You. May my life bring glory to your name in all&nbsp;that I do. May the old things truly pass away, as I behold all things, all new.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been searching the internet all tonight looking for a good school to go too. My main hope is to get a "school cut" a school cut is a ticket out of the Marine Corps about three months early and a great way to avoid going to Iraq. I really do not want to go to Iraq at all. If I have to go I suppose I will. Do I see a point in it? No. Do I completely agree with the war? No. But none the less I will fulfill my contract and obligation that I swore to upon entering.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be abundantly clear to anyone reading this, but I will state it anyway. I have no freakin' idea what I want to do with my life. The reality is that I lack almost all basic skills necesary for completing school. Most people I see online in the Blogger/Xanga domain somehow understood or were made to understand the importance of school. At the very least they made it past Algebra 1, or English comp, or maybe even a typing class.&nbsp; Not me, in the years I should have been learning basic grammar and multiplication tables and what not, I was moving around.&nbsp; In the years following from their&nbsp;I was in jail. After that point up until I graduated I just did what I had to to get by. So now I find myself in quite a predicament.... What and the hell do I do?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, I feel like I would fail school if I attempt it. I am so scared of the possibility of failing that&nbsp;I am almost willing to put myself through the hell of more military life to avoid faillure. Scary thought. I have always been afraid to fail... I used to lose races and wrestling matches in highschool on purpose, becuase I would think to myself, what if I give everything I have and it is not good enough? I suppose I am asking the same question right now.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't need someone to reassure me that I am smart and should not have any problems. I know I am smart, I would be lying and be full of false modesty(pride) if I denied it for the sake of modesty. And in my own defense, saying that I know I am intelligent does not mean that I think myself the most intelligent or better than anyone I am&nbsp;simply stating&nbsp;a fact.&nbsp; I need something I can stand on.&nbsp; Perhaps a trip back through elementary school like on Billy Madison, or private tutors, or a miracle!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my prime I used to be able to run 5k in 16:48 and bench press 315lbs. I used to run everyday and sleep well at night, but something has changed. For some reason I only slep a few hours a night, never ever run or work out, have high blood pressure, and am chronically depressed. Now, I have never really taken well to the name it claim it campaign, maybe I am just to much of a realist. In fact, the reality is that I just hate my life as a Marine. I hate putting on my uniform everyday. I hate having to put on this show in front of people on a daily basis. I just want to be me! I want to live my damn life and enjoy some of the freedoms we are supposedly propagating in Iraq right now. This anger is as much me as anything in my life. This hatred that I habor towards God every today for my crooked teeth, my lack of education, my poor upbringing, my current job. This anger is what keeps me going. I will have to be honest with myself and admit that. The Bible preaches a Gospel that I have never lived out in my daily life, nor in my thoughts or prayer closet. This by no means goes to say that I do not Believe in Jesus Christ in every Orthodox sense of the word belief, but it does mean that I do not see the reality of Christ living in me at all. It makes much more sense to say selfish motivation has drove me this far in my life. Now guilt ridden and sin ridden, I do not know if I can do this anymore on my own strength. Help me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The mind is amazing, I guess I never really take the time to wonder about it till I have had to use it for a while. I have a subscription to World magazine now, World is a weekly Christian magazine that puts issues in politics and society in a Christian Perspective. I think most of the writers are Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic so they hold to a very Fundemental outlook on life. The other subscription I now have is to First Things, look on  urlLink http://www.firstthings.com  to get the info on it. I really think some of the issues brought up in the Magazine are very important. I decided I need to learn about what is going on around the world as well as how I should think about what is going on. I know some of you might be saying "Why not check out secular sources to find balance in the coverage?" To this I answer, I am immersed in the secular sources. Most people go about regurgitating the latest political buzzwords, the all to convienent and truistic trade words of your particular party, and the clever commentary of our media conditioned culture that hold no water whatsoever. All the while not really knowing what they are saying only repeating as a parrot would. The only thing I see when I watch the presidential debates is a blithe boxing match where the contestants are more concerned with the looking good than they are are with winning. Since I do not claim to be so well endowed with understanding and discernment as to be able to extract the egg from the cake. Meaning to draw out some minuscule measure of truth from the floodtide of lies pervading our media. I am forced to look to those who have spent there lives trying to understand these positions and it just so happens; they are Chrisitan. Besides I noticed that my mind is a blank slate, whatever I fill it with seems to take the reins of my heart and soul. With the knowledge that the media is not fair in it's reporting and whatever enters my mind dramatically shapes my outlook, I just think it safer to guard my heart and read Christian sources. Mind you I will stay this same course until I am steadfast in my resolve concerning the Christian Worldview. I wrestled with the idea of going to Iraq for some time up until maybe a week ago. I wondered about the justification of going to Iraq based on all of the arguements with the weapons of mass destruction. I wondered about the justification based off of the Just War theory. I wondered about the Justification based off of God's word. Throw in Farenheit 9/11 and you have yourself one confused young Marine. Should I be over in Iraq guarding oil wells, risking my life for the sake of finacial gain? Is my president somekind of money grubbing jerk who uses Christianity as his cover for all manner of evil? I decided I don't really care. There are so many superficial issues that vexed me about going. I will not go over all of them I will only state why now I say I do not care anymore. After speaking with many people on the issue, looking in the word and trying to understand Jesus's stance on war and reading some articles I came to my current understanding. The view I now hold is that the justifcation for going comes not from international law and the Just War theory, not even from national security concerns, nor revenge. No amount of evidence showing how dishonest the president is will alter the fact that what is going on in Iraq is God ordained. When I look at Scripture and read the words Christ speaks about loving our enemies, turning the other cheek, and accepting persecution it seems initially like a open and shut case. Why not hold to Tolstoyian philosophy concerning war, it seems biblically based off of the beatitudes. This until I open my eyes and realize the same Jesus who spoke those words is the same God who destroyed whole nations of people who rebelled against him. The same God who cares for the poor, downtrodden and the oppressed. This immutable Spirit tells me to break the yoke of sin and set the captives free. I know from reading harrowing accounts from Iraqi people who lived in Saddams regime how very evil it was. The times he used chemical and biological weapons on his own people, or had women raped in front of their husbands to coherse the man to some purpose of Saddam's. The rape was often times videotaped and sent to family members in order to bring disgrace to the family. He had torture cells with meat grinders in them to grind victims while still alive. There are many more examples besides to show the wickedness of his regime. In the end my justification comes from the fact that ideally war sucks and should not be. There should not be over 30 dictators in the world that oppress their people with violence, but the fact is there are. In the world right now there are millions of people living in hell on earth. God cares for these people and blesses the United States in order to reach out to them with loving compassion. Since the war in Iraq the country has been opened to the Gospel in a new and refreshing way and a evil regime has been brought down. This to me is something that is pleasing in God's sight. If the U.S. is acting out of completely selfish motives God will deal with us. In the mean time I might as well focus on His purposes in all of this and not my own, or someone elses political or personal agenda. If I have offended someone or you completely disagree with my reasoning you will have to talk it through with me, becuase I suck at writing. I have much more sound justification than what I put down here, but my lack of writing skill hinders me from giving it proper heed. Well I will write more later, Jesus Loves you!!

      No messing around, no trailing off in some incoherent babble, only what is going on in my life. Right now it is 12:14am and I must wake up in about 5 hours. This is part of my normal routine, on a daily basis I start work around 0700 in the morning military time and get off at about 1630. I shower change change out of my camoflauge utilities uniform into regular people clothes and go out. Going out for me on a monday night is sitting in the Barnes&Noble in Oceanside and reading drinking tea. Right now I am reading Blue Like Jazz by a guy named Donald Miller. So far so good. It is right in line with the whole new Christian Postmodern movement headed by men like Brian McLaren, and Millard J. Erikson. Some kinda breaking free from the shackles of deductionism and reactionary spirit that comes with Modernism. They want to use Post Modernism not the extreme kind i.e. "the truth is there is no truth" as a tool to witness to the generation of now and appeal to them on more relevent basis. An example would be to use beauty and showing how certain lifestyles are not beautiful, instead of thumping them over the head with you Bible. Not that Donald Miller is adressing the issue of Post Modernism in his book, I just believe there to be a post modern feel to it. A better word I would use for it is honest. Donald Miller is honest with who he is and it is working my heart.       I am also reading Moutain of Spices the sequal to Hinds Feet on High Places, both of which are spiritual allegories. On the cover it says An allegory about human weaknesses and Strengths comaparing the spices in song of Solomon to the fruits of the Spirit. I am only about 50 pages into it, but already all of it applies to me. Hinds feet on High Places changed the way I perceive my daily walk and interactions with others I feel this one is gonna do the same.      My freinds Russ and Kevin left two, 4 min long messages on my voice mail, they are funny guys. Apparently they wanted me to eat some pick up sticks with them. The best message I received came from my freind Justin who just returned from a 2 month long missionary trip to Croatia. Of course he lives in Nebraska and I in California, but at least now I can find out how the Missions work went and just hear how the Lord has been working in his life.  My freind Nick also called he joined the Marine Corps about 6 months before I did and is getting out in 2 weeks. He plans on moving back to Nebraska and working at a bar in the small town of Battle Creek population 997 people and growing. We used to do alot of partying together back in my savage days. He really only smoked pot and drank with me. Ocassionally he would trip on acid with me, or eat some shrooms. He never got involved with he more serious drugs I was addicted too. The problem with him now is he still thinks of me as the same person and want's to drink with me all the time. I am not one who believes drinking to be a sin. I think it is smarter to stay away from and have all kinds of wonderful arguements I could wax intellectual with concerning the issue but will leave it be for now.      I have a really large group of people I can turn to for help in anykind of trouble. I have been blessed with more friends than I can really stay in touch with properly. I think by now most of them know that I am just strange. I have weeks where I will hang out pretty steady then other weeks where I have some strange social anxiety and cannot handle being around people. In fact I get very standoffish. I am not a very good freind. I rarely return calls on time and never am reliable with hanging out becuase some weekends I will opt to spend reading at Barnes&Noble instead of doing anything. Or I will hang out with people I hardly know instead of my core group. This thie point where I would normally get extremely introspective and dwelve into why exactly I act the way I do, but today I resist. victory!!      Friday I went to the Switchfoot show!!! The show was really good and they played like three new songs. My freinds Willy, Becky, Jamie and Nicole are personal freinds of the band and talked with Linda the lead singers wife. I, on the other hand left as soon as the show was over. I was a little curious about the lack of giving God the glory talk out of the band members. I would want to ask them what they think about there responsibility to spread the Gospel and how they are acting on it. One way I see it pan out is when I tell someone that Switchfoot is a Christian band and they say "really!" I say yeah, listen to the lyrics of such and such a song. Basically, I explain Christianity in the context of explaining a song meaning. I wonder if that is their intent and if they are fine with being sponsered by Jack Daniels and Heiniken beer? I am not some judge or anything, I am ot passing moral judgement I am just curious as to how they are dealing with everything, where are their hearts at? That is plenty of late night ranting for me. Since I highly doubt anyone will read this entire entry i will include that I love Carne Asada Burrito's, a lot. By the way the title has nothing to do with anything.
