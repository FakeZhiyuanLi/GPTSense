						   So David Millar has admitted to taking banned substances (erythropoietin for those who care) just 8 days before the Tour starts.  He's the 8th person under investigation in what is now widely being referred to as the Cofidis Affair.  The team suspended racing for a month earlier this year to let things die down but this stuff is just not going away.   So, let me ask you a question.  Is Cofidis being banned as a team from riding in the Tour de France?   No.  And why not?  Because it would be bad for French cycling.  I'm not making this up.  Cofidis is the largest and most well funded French team and Jean-Marie LeBlanc (head of the organization which puts on the Tour de France) would rather they ride the Tour under a huge cloud of suspicion than just kick them out.  Those who have been watching carefully know this is a gigantic pile of steaming poo.  Communidad Valenciana-Kelme was banned from the Tour this year because a disgruntled former rider made all kinds of sensational accusations, which so far are completely without proof.  Cofidis has had a number of people ARRESTED and CHARGED WITH CRIMES but because they've fired everyone who has gotten caught, LeBlanc says, of course they can ride.  Way to take a tough antidoping position, Jean-Marie!  Of course, the rest of the team aren't under a cloud of doping suspicion.  After all, just because a quarter of the team has been found to be doping is no reason to even  suspect  others might also be unfit to ride.  Sheesh.  Oh well, at least I enjoy riding my bike.  I rode a beautiful sunny 38 miles this morning and it was hella fun.  I highly recommend you try it.

						   My posts over the next month are likely to include lots of wonky analysis of the Tour de France.  I have been looking forward to this ever since last July, when Lance Armstrong raised his fist in victory in Nantes, after clinching his fifth and most recent victory.  My particular dog in this hunt is  urlLink Tyler Hamilton , who is actually a few months older than Lance.  Tyler came in to the sport later and has progressed more slowly, but this year is likely to be his best chance of ever winning the Tour, even if he has to break Lance's streak to do it.  Tyler rides for the Swiss Phonak team, who look strong enough to support him should he manage to get in to the yellow jersey.  We shall see.  In this cycling vein, the best source for bike racing news on the planet is  urlLink Cyclingnews .   urlLink Velonews  is also great, and a little more focused on the US scene (not to mention being more attractive).

"We try to encourage people to actually go inside the Art Museum, too," the center's chief executive, Bill Moore, said. "But a lot of people just want to run up the steps."   That's awesome.

						   Seeing as how the first ten days of Le Tour were calculated for maximum boringosity to GC contenders, I'll start posting on new albums.   Preordered Rogue Wave's first full-length,  urlLink Out of the Shadow  and got it in the mail last night.  I've listened to the first song about 6 times already.  Damn is that good.  The album starts to drag in the middle a bit, but it's all quality stuff, and I will check in again when I have had the chance to give it a little more careful listen.   Watch this space for reviews of Replacements'  Let It Be , Neko Case's  Blacklisted , John Wilkes Booze's  Five Pillars of Soul , and AC Newman's  Slow Wonder .  Yes, I have been picking up a few CDs lately.

						    urlLink These  examples are a little scary.   urlLink This  starts out understandable, but then the guy ends up on a terrorist watch list.  A high price to pay for writing a stupid segment about bombs for his novel while on a plane.    Some would say there is a gray area between keeping the peace and censorship- a la thought police.  I would agree, but some of these seem to be in the dark side of that gray area.  Seems excessive to me.    Thanks to the the donkey and political animal for these links.

						   Every once in a while you find something on google that just makes your head spin.  I was trying to find a bulk quote price for ruthenium in elemental form, aka ruthenium metal.  So I type in the following unmodified:  urlLink metal prices ruthenium.   First hit OK, but the price looks off to me, so we start scrolling down.  Where it gets interesting is in  urlLink hit #5  entitled "precious metals". Starts out fine with some pretty standard info on precious metals: where they come from, common uses, with a few weird things added in like the following-  "Precious metals are now being actively and aggressively researched for their potential medical benefits.  Laurence Gardner [1] has provided considerably evidence in this regard by showing that these metals in their Monoatomic Elements, ORME, state are capable of amazing and astounding actions."  That "provided considerably evidence" construction is theirs.  And I've not heard or Laurence Gardner or much about the medicinal value of precious metals outside of Cis-Platnin for cancer, but what the hey - I'm no expert in the field.  Anyway, I'm curious now so I get the the end of the page and there is this link to the  urlLink The Philosopher's Stone.   This is some of the most fucked up psuedo-science I've read in a long time.  Its well worth the read if not for comidic value.

						   Chris  urlLink asks  a good question.  I myself was gonna mention this soon too as I picked up the super extended reissue of  Slanted and Enchanted  just before my trip to Japan.  The liner notes to "S+E", as it's so affectedly self-referenced, act as if it were some kind of watershed album in the indie scene, busting down barriers and changing lives.  It  is  a really good album, no doubt about it.  But a revolution?  I don't think so.  Jen heard it the other day, and actually asked me if it was Lotus Dinner.  This doesn't surprise me, as Pavement couldn't play their instruments either.    Why didn't we get into Pavement sooner?  Two related reasons; exposure and lack of separation.  I never heard a Pavement song until Haircut from  Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain .  I saw the video on MTV, read the review in Rolling Stone.  This is where you get music information in small, central Wisconsin towns before widespread Internet.  The Rolling Stone review got me interested in the album, but I ended up purchasing PJ Harvey's  To Bring You My Love  instead, and I can't say I'm any worse off for the decision.  There's a million bands out there being talked about at any given point, and not many people in my milieu were even talking about Pavement, much less gushing about them in the extravagant ways mentioned in the hipster liner notes.  Pavement never really separated themselves in our minds from a thousand other similar bands, who all basically had the same aesthetic and some exposure.  S+E is a really enjoyable album and I am glad to get into their music, as nothing like it is really being made right now.  Stuff I like lately, like  urlLink The Shins ,  urlLink The Constantines ,  urlLink The Decemberists  and  urlLink AC Newman  is all far more musical, well-produced and accomplished.  I don't hear anybody making music like Pavement lately and that kind of sucks, but it's pretty understandable.  The inevitable fate of bands who depend on lack of musicianship is their development of musicianship through rote repetition.  It seems like bands are once again no longer becoming popular when they objectively suck and to me, having reached for musical maturity in the early 90s, there's an empty place.  I'm sure I'll pick up more Pavement as I get bored with S+E, but I have to confess a certain lack of concern over missing out on them the first time.  I heard a lot of great music in the early 90s and that particular hunger was satisfied in other ways (coff, Lotus Dinner, coff).

						   Just got a copy of Pavement's  urlLink "Brighten the Corners" .  Like most good music that I come to like over time, I ask myself, "Why didn't I get into this earlier?"   Well... taste for some music is acquired, and Pavement probably fits into that category.  But Pavement' music is like coffee- once you get a taste for it, its hard to remember not liking it.  And with a couple of spoons fulla' sugar like "Shady Lane" and "Stereo" will make this one go down easy if its your first cup o' Pavement.

						   Wow.  The  urlLink stage 4  TTT lived up to its billing today.  Talk about excitement.  Torrential rain meant there were crashes and surprises all over the place.    My boy  urlLink Tyler Hamilton  willed his team into second place after losing FOUR riders on the road.  Had  urlLink Phonak  lost one more, they would have been SOL, as time is taken on the fifth rider across the line.  Hamilton lost only 20 seconds to Lance today.    Speaking of  urlLink USPS , they dominated for the second year in a row.  Once again, they started a little slow, but they ramped it up until their advantage was over a minute.  They held it there as taking more time would have been pointless due to the obscure new rules this year.    Jan Ullrich's  urlLink T-Mobile Team  landed in fourth, meaning the German lost another 40 seconds to Lance and is already nearly a minute behind, before we've even seen any mountains.  I think they are paying for the decision to not bring Cadel Evans to the tour.  He would have been a big help today.   urlLink Euskaltel-Euskadi  avoided the worst case scenario, losing only 1 minute 20 seconds to the leader today, but Mayo and Zubeldia are now 5 and a half minutes back.  They can attack in the Pyrenees and gain a fair amount of time and still not be particularly worrisome to LA, Hamilton or Ullrich.  Finally, let's not forget Roberto Heras, whose  urlLink Liberty Seguros  put in a solid, though unsurprising 7th place ride, meaning Heras is now one and three quarter minutes down.  That's a much more manageable gap and Heras could certainly make that up at  urlLink La Mongie  or  urlLink Plateau de Beille .  This tour is shaping up to be pretty awesome.  Lance looks very strong right now, but he did last year at this time as well.

						   I can’t help but post my response to Matt’s slacktivist inspired post in the main page.  It’s a great topic for discussion.  My favorite part of the slacktivist post:  "Due to expensive land and encroaching urbanization, southern California [dairy farms] dairies are more geographically concentrated than those in other states, leading to a bigger manure problem. At a typical dairy [farm], hundreds of cows are locked into stations where they line up to eat hay. Once released into open areas, they jam together under whatever shade they can find to avoid the heat and glare of the sun."  This is what those a-holes must mean in the "happy cow adds" I see on TV.  The only hope is that investigative reporters will put this kind of stuff into the mainstream and enough people will worry about quality a la Upton Sinclair so positive change takes place.  At the same time, I continue to eat meat with little remorse.  Is this wrong?  My actions do support things that I know are wrong.  Why can't it be like when I was a boy?  Those days are gone, but I learned a lot growing up.  I’m not about to give up meat and dairy, but my eyes are open.  On the farm where I grew up we actually raised a fare about of the meat and eggs that went on the table.  We had chickens (some for eggs, some for eating), turkeys, and pigs.  We fished in our own boat and the times we caught dinner were the only times fish was on the menu.  We did catch extra and freeze them. Beef and dairy all came from the market.  After all that, I, and probably my sister, knew where meat came from - dead animals.  Animals that didn’t want to become dead animals.  I wish others had that experience.  I wish that everyone that eats meat had to raise an animal from birth – kill it – then decide if they wanted to eat it.  I’ve made my choice.  I wish folks that provide meat for the market took as good a care with their animals as we did with ours - for health reasons mostly, for the animal’s general well-being too.   My problem with it is that too many people just take it for granted – don’t think about where the meat is coming from.  Many get squeamish when they see slaughtering or butchering taking place.  Some can’t even stand the whole gutted fish in the market.  It is about making informed decisions, if the decision is to eat healthy meat raised in a humane way, like our family farm, then I’m all for it.    A counter argument often raised to justify factory farms is that it lowers the cost of the product, so more people can afford to eat foods that improve their diet.  Salmon farms are often the favorite example.  There is a point to be made here.    On the other hand- does this mean the economies of centralized animal raising and processing are really providing the best product for the lowest price in beef, chicken and pork?  The cost sure is lower, but why?  Part of the problem, is that the cost to the environment from these places is not passed on to the consumer.  It’s passed on to the neighbors of these large factory farms.  Other costs are  urlLink subsidized  by our federal government.  My main thesis is probably this – real positive change is only going to happen if consumers get hit with health problems or in the pocket book.  Cynical, but true I think.   Not everyone is going to have the type of experience I had growing up.  Fewer still will make a conscious decision about it like Matt and Jen.  Perhaps the wake up call is coming, let’s hope its not too painful.

						    urlLink This is good .   "Sir," said the eloquent congressman, addressing the vice president on the floor of the Senate, "it is my duty to inform you that I am composed of an elastic and rubbery substance, whilst you are constituted of a most mucilaginous glue; and those very imprecations which you see fit to hurl so intemperately at my person, rebound from my resilient anatomy and adhere indissolubly to you."

						   Fred Clark  urlLink has a point .  There's something deeply wrong with a system that makes the animals that feed us seem like Divine in Pink Flamingos.    The words "farm" and "farmer" don't really apply to most of the American food sources right now.  Industrialization has been unequivocally bad for our health, environment, small towns, migrant workers and souls.  I had been a vegetarian for about three years, when I started eating meat again last year.  I felt like I wasn't having an impact and I lost my determination to do what little I could to improve the lives of farm animals.  It's good to be reminded at this point about the reasons I originally chose to be a vegetarian, and also to be reminded that I am too often avoiding hard decisions about my diet.  Perhaps I will become a vegetarian again, or maybe I'll just start shelling out the higher prices for meat I know is produced in humane ways.  This is important.

						   Well, the predictions do sometimes hold up.  Every pundit before the race was saying how the Tour de France could be lost on stage 3's cobblestone sections, even if it couldn't be won there.  Sure enough, Iban Mayo  urlLink lost almost four minutes  today and with it, any realistic chance he might once have had at winning the tour.  He can expect to lose another 2 and a half minutes tomorrow in the team time trial, leaving him with an insurmountable deficit, considering there's 60 km of time trials (not his strong suit) yet to come.  Jean-Patrick Nazon picked up another stage win.  His team gave him a perfect leadout as McEwen had gone too early and faded in the last 25 meters.  Nazon appears to be the great French sprinting hope, which would be nice, because then we won't have to listen to all the stories about how pathetic French cycling is for the next few years.  Robbie McEwen squeaked into the yellow jersey with his 3rd place.  He nearly pooched it by going waay too early in the uphill sprint, but managed to pick up the bonus seconds that earned him  jaune .  Good on ya, mate.

						   Hmm.  Here I am, a day late, and thinking what a good idea it is to list my freedoms on Independence Day.  Well, here's mine;  Freedom to be totally pissed off at  urlLink this guy .  Freedom to go cycling pretty much whenever I want, considering I have a wife, kid, house and job.  Freedom to buy a whole bunch of crap I  urlLink don't need , but  urlLink lust after  anyway.  Freedom to read a  urlLink wide   urlLink variety  of  urlLink opinion  and  urlLink information .  Freedom to live basically the life I want to lead, free from major wants or worries.    I live a blessed life and it always peeves me to see people who have no idea how bad it could be.  People who avoid  seeing  poverty and its attendant problems are surpassed on my personal shit list only by people who see it and think how lazy and undeserving those poor people must be.  At the top of my list are those "christians" who insist on selectively enforcing obscure dictates of the Old Testament while simultaneously ignoring the  urlLink Sermon on the Mount , also known as the Word of God.  If you are a follower of Christ, then work on the problems that he saw.  Poverty, revenge, anger and war.  These are the problems.  Not homosexuality, not abortion.  Usury is wrong ( urlLink Citibank , I'm looking at you).  Accumulation of wealth is wrong and evil.  It doesn't get any clearer than this.  I have a lot of problems with how I live my life, but I believe if I focus on this stuff, I can be a better father, husband, citizen and human being.  The Sermon on the Mount is basically the only reason I still have faith.  It is so natural and right.  Regardless of the religious trappings, it's a blueprint for the world as it should be lived.    Remind to talk about how freeing this is sometime.  I'll explain Brahms to you.

						   For the holiday weekend, the folks at Pitchfork   urlLink reposted  2003's great "choose a new National Anthem for the good ol US of A" shtick.  There is a great history and fun facts on Key's "The Star-Spangled Banner" and why we should ditch the unsingable ditty.  I think my vote is with Matt LeMay: lets adopt the Pixies  urlLink "Wave of Mutilation" .  The first time I heard the song, I mistook the title lyric for "wave all through the nation". Thats almost "Big ol Jed had a Light On" or "Excuse me while I Kiss this Guy" in terms of embarressing misinterpetation of lyrics, but in this case it just turns the Frank Black tune into a patriotic dirge of surrendering to unity under the flag.  Lets change the lyrics to my mistaken version, then it will make a great national anthem.  Write your congressman today!

						   Well, this is why prediction is so darn difficult and it's why they ride the races.  Alessandro Petacchi of Fassa Bortolo has not been dominating the two sprint finished so far.  As yet, he hasn't even podiumed and his vaunted Fassa Bortolo sprint train has looked disorganized, underpowered and out of synch.  Stage 1 especially, with its long, straight finish, was expected to be Petacchi's playground.  Instead, his train got swamped with 800 meters to go, and veteran Jaan Kirsipuu  urlLink got the win .   Today was a technical, in-town finish and Petacchi could only manage 8th on a stage won by  urlLink Robbie McEwen , who got the jump on everyone and practically had time to shower and shave in the time it took the other sprinters to get across the line.   Also of note, Norwegian national champion Thor Hushovd managed to squeak into the yellow jersey.  Go Scandinavia!  Oh yeah, and my triathlon relay won the team's competition with a 1:01:02.  I won a mug!

						   Independence Day is a great opportunity to think about leaving the indentured servitude of graduate school.  A draft of my ticket out of here is shaping up - in the form of an NIH (National Institutes of Health) post-doctoral funding application.  Funny how a ticket to freedom can look a lot like a 20-some-page federal government form, but that’s really what it looks like for me.  I think its time for a "Freedoms List".  Those freedoms I'm starting to take even now as I gear up to leave the nest here at Irvine  Freedom to work on science projects of my choosing, predicated on funding of course.  Freedom to get as much gym time as I can handle.  Back down to 156 lbs!  WooHoo!  I haven't been able to bench press my weight since high-school, coming up on 10 years past.  After about one and a half months of steady gym-going with a workout partner willing to challenge me, that goal may be in reach soon.  Man, do my triceps hurt... but Ros loves 'em! and I feel great.  Still not getting 50 miles + of bike riding cardio like Matt and Jen, but one thing at a time.  Freedom of thought.  The single mindedness, extreme focus, put into a dissertation project really dominated my mind.  It is fun to start thinking about so many other things... art, music, science, politics.  Freedom from the Orange Curtain...  Couldn't resist a shot at "the OC".  cheers

						   The Tour Prologue was yesterday.  Armstrong was just as strong as expected placing 2nd  at 3 seconds back of TT specialist Fabian Cancellara.  Ullrich lost 15 seconds or so to Lance, but I don't think that's very worrying to him.  Jan has never beaten Armstrong in a prologue, so I doubt he's worried about this one.   My boy Tyler also lost 16 seconds to Armstrong, and I can't help but think that's a little more scary.  Tyler was all over his bike in the last couple kilometers and didn't look good.  We'll see.  Maybe he peaked early and maybe he just had a bad day.  If yr gonna have a bad day, the prologue, where you can't lose too much time, is the place to have it.  I myself am awake at 4 am as I am preparing to ride the bike leg of the  urlLink Firecracker Triathlon   It's a 12-mile time trial with 12 corners, so I am expecting just under 30 minutes for my split.  Then, at noon today, Saguaro Velo is having a pool party, so I'll relax there and try not to get a sunburn.  Have a nice day...

						   So I was thinking about a long post concerning the mysterious absence of gratuitous nudity in modern cinema, when  urlLink Political Animal  posts a link to  urlLink this .   A new study from the Harvard School of Public Health has found that a decade of "ratings creep" has allowed more violent and sexually explicit content into films, suggesting that movie raters have grown more lenient in their standards.  ....The study, which was issued on Tuesday, quantified what children's advocates and critics of the ratings system have said anecdotally for years: that a movie rated PG or PG-13 today has more sexual or violent content than a similarly rated movie in the past.    Now, my thesis is that before PG-13, you basically couldn't make an R-rated comedy without a little gratuitous female nudity.  The list of early 80s comedies with some fleeting frontal shot of women's breasts is as long as your proverbial arm.  This list is topped, of course, by Phoebe Cates' mind-altering appearance in  urlLink Fast Times at Ridgemont High , but a long list of shower scenes, changing scenes, love scenes and just flat out bizarre unexplained nipples preceded it.  I realized the worm had turned while watching  urlLink Bad Santa  two days ago.  This movie, if you aren't familiar with it, features an incredibly foul mouthed drunkard played by Billy Bob Thornton as a criminal who dresses up as Santa, then steals half the store after it closes on Christmas Eve every year.  Don't worry, the ending is heartwarming.  Billy Bob's character gets laid multiple times in the film and  never is there a bare nipple to be found !  What could be the point of this?  He must say the f-word 150 times throughout the movie, making references to anal sex and Mrs. Santa's sister all the way.  The producers knew they were going to have an R-rating and frontal nudity would have been completely appropriate for the film.  Yet for some reason, they held back.  This is a huge puzzle to me.  What's going on here?  On one hand, we have some researchers saying that ratings creep has been occurring for the last 11 years in a big way, and on the other, we have films that aren't explicitly about sex avoiding nudity like it's a  bad thing .  Weird.  I'd also point out that depictions of explicitly sexual violence have gotten more common over the last few years.   urlLink Monster  has an absolutely agonizing rape scene, and indy films especially seem to equate showing this sexual violence with realism, rather than exploitation.  But the type of nudity I am talking about from the 80s was in my mind  far  less exploitive in the sense that it was often celebratory of the power of the human body.  It was objectification yes, but modern feminism has certainly shown us the double-edged nature of that kind of objectification, in that it also becomes a tool of empowerment in the enlightened woman.  So it depresses me that essentially neutral nudity has been expunged from film, while horrific dysfunctional power struggles and sexual violence still seem to have their place.

						   Ok - so we're all up on the Governator's  urlLink "girlie men"  comment in ref to the Democrats in the annual budget crunch out here in the land o’ sunshine.

Relevent Quote:  “Republican leaders McCarthy and Ackerman, in an effort to show that negotiations were back on track, wheeled down a $2,000 Jura espresso maker that GOP members had purchased for the governor.  They pasted a sign on it that said: ‘Back in service.’ The lawmakers were playing off Burton's refusal to bring the governor whipped milk from his own machine, which had become Burton's practice until the weekend blitz by Schwarzenegger cut off the gifts.”  Two questions:  (1)  When did Schwarzenegger start thinking Burton and other Dems were “girlie men”? During budget crunch or after they brought him whipped milk for the first time?  I mean, come on, I like friendly partisan relations too, but bringing the guy whipped milk?   Its like an emasculated version of the "secretary stereotype" of bringing the boss coffee.  I’m surprised Schwarzenegger didn’t ask Burton if his favorite dessert was creampuffs.  (2)  What the fuck are these people doing with $2000 espresso makers anyway?  They were either paid for with tax dollars or contributions to the political parties, I’d bet.  And now both parties have one?  Great use of funds folks – that two grand on the espresso maker is really doing a lot for the citizens or party supporters.  Even if they were not paid for in either of those ways, isn’t this still a little excessive when the rest of us make do with Mr. Coffee? Scheesh.

						   Paul Cz offers up the  urlLink following  from the Strib... He told police he puts himself where train crews can see him - engineers and conductors consider him a regular - and makes obscene gestures because he is frustrated by their loud horns.   Well, if that's not a reason, I don't know what is.    Actually, when I read the article, I was struck by how completely understandable his behavior was.  I used to be the kind of person who would laugh at this and just shrug it off but now I find myself thinking about his situation and sympathizing to an extent.  Not to say that I'd ever make a habit of sitting by the tracks, flipping off relatively innocent engineers, but I get why he does it.

						   On Monday I sent a draft of the proposal, and the rest of section one of the funding application to my potential future boss.  The prop still needs a lot of work, but its starting to come together.  As an excellent reward, I had purchased tickets to the  urlLink Modest Mouse  concert at the  urlLink Wiltern  in LA.  Surprisingly, after dropping of the prop at FedEx at about 6PM and heading out, traffic was great from OC to LA.  We got there at about 7:30 (show started at 8:00) and hung out for a little while.    The Wiltern is a mid-sized venue, probably holds about 2-3000 on two levels, a floor, and a balcony that has seats.  The interior design is like an old opera house.  I could only get tickets for the balcony when I bought them in early July, so my five friends and I got some drinks and headed to the seats.  The view from the balcony was great, and the opener,  urlLink The Walkmen , had a good sound, bringing out this old standup piano for a few numbers.  The piano sounded like a piano from a saloon in a western, which made for an interesting mix with their indie rock sound.  Down side was the vocal performance.  They were not up high enough in the mix, I think the lead singer realized this and basically over compensated.  Kinda sounded like Bob Dylan crossed with Tom Yorke with a brown paper bag over his head - not good.  But the musical performance other than vocals was great.  Now, the last time I saw MM, at the  urlLink 400 Bar   in Minneapolis, the band was a standard three piece on tour.  Well, as we know, they’ve re-added Dann Gallucci for additional guitars and Green is back drumming, however, it appears that Benjamin Weikel is still touring with them, but appeared to have relatively little to do on stage, although sitting with a drum kit, he basically added additional percussion – the poor guy was stuck with a tambourine on far too many songs though.  I felt sorry for him, although I prefer Green’s drumming with MM, Weikel’s got talent too, and it seemed to be going to waste here. They are now also touring with an electric cello player, who adds backup vocals on a few songs.  So at some points, MM was a full six people on stage, quite a different act from the band I saw in The Hole back in 1998 which had me a little worried at first.  The results were fantastic.  Outside of a few technical problems with sound, they put on a great show, playing many tracks off their new album including many of my favorites, The View, Ocean Breathes Salty, Burkowski, Black Cadillacs, Float On, and The Good Times are Killing Me.  They mixed in some good older songs off Moon and Antarctica like Paper Thin Walls and Wild Pack of Family Dogs.  And they working in the Never Ending Math Equation, and Isaac nailed the never-really-ever-even-ever-really-ever-ends lyric.  They were really tight, great live sounds, had all the instrumentation to make things sound great, but still had a wonderful live sound too (swapped out guitar for Banjo, or electric for acustic, Erik Judy played a little mellotron or moog or something, Gallucci added some keyboards on some of the Good News songs).  They ended on Doing the Cockroach off the Lonesome Crowded West, Isaac got to give us the last of the lyrics through the pickups of his guitar.  They came back for a brief encore that ended on one of my favorite MM songs, Broke.  We didn’t get to hear too much of Lonesome Crowded era songs and nothing from Long Drive, but I’d seen most of that live back in the late 90’s, so I wasn’t missing it.  Isaac talked to the crowd some, in his usual mumbled lisp.  Pretty clear he’d been drinking before the show, but I’m sure that’s standard.  He related a story about how he’s got a new roommate, a guy that use to be homeless, but is living with him now and at one point took a shower for 5 hours.  He’s keeping it real – or something.    Great show from a great band.   PS: Modest Mouse is suppose to be on the  urlLink Conan O'Brian Show  tonight.

						   Here's a letter I sent to cyclingnews.com.  New letters come out on Fridays so it may get published tomorrow.  I'm sure Chris and Ros are tremendously interested in the finer points of doping scandals in cycling to here goes...  I'm just writing to commend everyone on the news staff for their fine reporting of the the recent series of doping incidents throughout cycling (French, Cofidis, Meirhaeghe, Bergman, Sbeih, Manzano/Kelme etc...).  The issues involved are far more complex than "all pros dope" or "Rider A was doping, therefore his team is dirty" and cyclingnews' coverage has been extremely sensitive to reporting the facts on the ground, rather than idle speculation.  The recent revelations in the French affair revealing only two riders' DNA in the sharps bucket are a wonderful example of the system working as it should.  If only the rest of the world press were so careful to avoid casting aspersions without evidence, several Australian riders would have been saved a tremendous amount of mental anguish.  Thankfully, those who are guilty appear to be on the road to punishment and hopefully, those who are innocent will not have an unjustified stain on their name in the future.  2004's rash of positive tests appears to be the result of a number of new tests coming into usage, and I fully expect more positive results at the Olympics, giving the recent arrival of a reliable HGH test.  But that's unequivocally a good thing.  While it seems as if many riders are testing positive right now, the actual percentage of positives is very low.  The UCI, WADA and other sanctioning organizations appear to be weeding out the guilty, which can only be healthy for the sport as a whole.  Innuendo and insinuations about doping, while easy to voice, are useless as a way of preventing cheating.  The only solution is to try to stay ahead of the dopers.  Testing will never be perfect, but we must all to our best to fight the rot in our sport.  Sincerely, Matt Runquist Tucson, AZ

						   So last night, rather than dutifully working on my funding application, I got suckered into watching one of the latest  urlLink Jerry Bruckheimer  classics, Bad Boys II by our roommate, Special K.  Now I never read a review of this movie, and don’t remember how it did in the box office, but having just seen how good an action movie sequel could be, in  urlLink Spiderman II , I thought I’d give it a go.  Wrong, Wrong, Wrong.  Perhaps I’m just getting too old for this crap, but the umpteenth car chase seen – the one with the dead bodies falling out of the mortuary van and getting decapitated on the street while  urlLink Will Smith  and  urlLink Martin Laurence  cracked wise - seemed a new low for me.

						   I went weightlifting with Chris and his newish roommate Matt on Saturday and boy, do my arms hurt.  Yikes.  I also won several state track championships this weekend.  I set personal records in the flying 200m (12.6), kilometer (1:18.4) and 4000m (1:34).  Additionall, I won my first match sprint, placed 2nd along with Mike Jolivet and Scott Ellis in the Team Sprint and placed 3rd (behind Curtis Gunn(!) and Corky Kurtz) in the points race.  All in all, a satisfying weekend.  Arizona State Track Championships was THE goal for the year and I am pleased and proud to have done so well there.  Big thank yous go out to Chris and Ros for putting me up on two nights, when hotel rooms in SD were going for $600 a pop and Gary Lawrence and Elizabeth for driving me back and forth, even though Gary was sick and ended up not riding.  I owe them a huge debt.

Wednesday, August 11 in Tempe, Arizona.  Dang.  I think I am gonna have to make arrangements to go.  It's been a long time since Chris and I and some other folks (Jen?, Rachel?, Paul?) saw Doug and the Gang at First Ave back in the day.  The highlight of the night?  Some dude upstairs screaming between each and every song, "Cleo!  Play Cleo!"  Hey buddy, I know Cleo is off TNWWL and so you think yr hot sh*t to be able to request obscure early music, but shut up.  I mean really, have some respect for yourself.  Also noted: Doug choosing some random to get up onstage and "play" his guitar during the extended instrumental breakdown of Broken Chairs so Doug could go get a smoke and a beer backstage.  At least, I think that's what he was doing.

						    urlLink Billmon  has a nice  urlLink takedown  of Barone's  urlLink latest column .  Man that guy rubs me the wrong way.   The best evidence last week's Democratic convention succeeded in accomplishing what Team Kerry set out to do is the Republican reaction, which is to insist the Boston infomercial was a false representation of both the party and the nominee.   To a certain extent, that's true - although as a progressive, I would argue it's not nearly as true as the conservative chattering class would have it. No matter how left-wing the delegates on the floor were on the hot-button issues (this was almost an hourly talking point on Fox and CNN) the face of the party establishment was pretty much the face we saw on the stage - culturally liberal on social issues, Clintonian centrists on economics, but most of all, completely pragmatic about elections and what it takes to win them.  This last quality, of course, is one the Mayberry Machiavellis also share. Which is why the criticism now coming from the right is so amusing: It mirrors almost exactly the Democratic complaints about the last Republican convention, in 2000. That, too, was derided as a false front. At times it seemed as if Rove and Co. had rounded up every non-white Republican official in the country and planted them on permanently on stage, while banishing the likes of Tom DeLay and Pat Robertson to the outer edges of prime time.  The most ridiculous example of this role reversal I've seen yet comes from Michael Barone, the effete conservative columnist turned Fox News talking head. In his convention week column, Barone railed against the Democrats for having the gall to complain about the divisive politics of the Rovian era:   Now Obama on Tuesday night, like Clinton on Monday night, said that the way to get rid of partisan division is to install the party that has vociferously promoted partisan division – that insists on the "Bush lied" theme ... It is like the man who murdered his mother and father and threw himself on the mercy of the court on the grounds that he was an orphan. The Democrats, having stirred up partisan turmoil and political division, now seek power on the grounds that they will eliminate them. What's amazing about Barone's diatribe is the complete absence of any awareness of how ironic it is for Republicans to complain about Democrats indulging in the politics of personal destruction on one hand, while promising to heal partisan wounds on the other.    This, of course, was precisely the political strategy pursued by the Rovians in 2000. If anything, they ran even further from the Clinton haters in their own party than the Democrats did from the Bush haters in Boston this year. And with good reason: Bush and Co. had the complete fiasco of the Clinton impeachment (and the congressional losses suffered by the GOP in 1998) to remind them how much swing voters hated the anti-Clinton moral hysteria.  Barone's bitching, in other words, sounds more like a claim of copyright infringement than a legimate gripe about Democratic hypocrisy. Imitation, after all, isn't just the most sincere form of flattery; it's also the heart and soul of competition.  It would seem, in other words, that both sides have learned the utility of the good cop/bad cop routine in an age when the left and the right both want red meat while the voters in the middle generally prefer their politics with a side order of Valium.   As the party out of power, the Democrats are naturally better positioned to put the technique to good use now. And, since the swing voters are a hell of lot more disturbed by the fiasco in Iraq and the partisan hype that got us into it than they ever were about Clinton's blow jobs, the Dems also don't need to as careful about keeping the Bush bashers out of sight and out of mind until November. If I were Barone, I'd be pissed, too.   Billmon's a mensch.  Barone is constantly setting up straw men and knocking them down, while simultaneously ingnoring the din of faux-conservative Republicans looting the cupboards behind him.  If the guy had a shred of sense, he'd be sprinting full speed towards  urlLink Kerry , who seems bound and determined to run a fundamentally conservative Clintonesque fiscal and budgetary policy as far as it can take him.  Instead, Barone is bitching about the political nature of politics and how unfair it is when the kids on the other side of the fence learn to play the game by the same rules, or lack thereof.

						    urlLink “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth”  have just launched their first big attack add against Kerry.  This story has so many facets and angles to it, that it merits discussion.    The “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” formed, basically, to take down Kerry by undercutting his credentials as a decorated combat veteran from the Vietnam War.  Most of them seem upset due to Kerry’s antiwar efforts after his honorable discharge from the Navy.  Some, as evidenced by the new add, feel Kerry did not deserve several of the medals he was awarded during his service.  Although these veterans served on the very dangerous swift boat duties, none were under Kerry’s command.  My opinion here is that these folks just don’t like Kerry’s politics, perhaps especially his Vietnam protesting after coming home, so they are going after him.  According to CNN, the Bush campaign is trying to distance itself from these folks, mainly because they don’t want reciprocal attacks on Bush’s past, likely including Bush’s Texas Air National Guard   urlLink SNAFU , driving under the influence  urlLink influence ,  urlLink cocaine  use, and likely others.  Of course, they say its because they want to look forward to the future, not the past.  Now there is a lot of  urlLink buzz  regarding one of veterans for truth (who wrote positive things about Kerry during the war) retracting the negative statements about Kerry made with the “veterans for truth”.  Then, his story changed again, and he retracted the retraction of his retraction/correction of his original report filed during Vietnam – got it?  It has always seemed to me that Vietnam means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.  Now, If it’s a two-way race then the basic facts on the Vietnam issue between the candidates are pretty clear - regardless of what other swift boat veterans have to say about the details of Kerry’s service.  In my mind, Kerry volunteered to go – period, George W. did not – period.  After the war, Kerry  urlLink protested  it with  urlLink Vietnam Veterans Against the War  and did some things that some find disrespectful to other veterans; after George W. got out of TANG, he got a DUI and snorted some coke, then got into some failed business ventures.  Both then, eventually, got elected to some office or another.  I’m not sure what effect this will have in Nov, if any.  People of my generation have experienced Vietnam mostly through TV (shows like  urlLink Tour of Duty  and  urlLink China Beach ) and movies like  urlLink Platoon  and  urlLink Full Metal Jacket , or maybe even  urlLink Rambo .  Some, like me, where born the sons and daughters of veterans – but how many really know their father’s experiences?  It’s not like my Dad talked to me about it very much. Dad’s got some great stories about the  urlLink USMC , but he doesn’t talk about his experience in Vietnam – mostly just the funny stories that don’t have anything to do with people getting killed.  Other children of veterans that I’ve talked too have similar experiences.  I’m OK with that.  Once, several years after I left high school, I went back to that school with my Dad, to watch him talk to a high school class about Vietnam.  The kids didn’t ask too many questions, but my old history teacher (Mr. Knoke) and the vice principal (Mr. Mork) sat in and asked some.  Dad wasn’t in a good mood after the talk; he didn’t feel like it accomplished very much.  (In fact, that’s also what he had to say about the war…)  To me, he sounded rather upset.  He said he didn’t think he’d go and talk again; I guess that was his first and only experience doing that kind of thing.  Now, what do the last 2 paragraphs have to do with Kerry and the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth?  Point is – for a lot of people of my parents’ generation, Vietnam remains a big deal, and the emotional baggage is substantial.  For a lot of people in my generation – it feelings are varied, but much less intense – just like the kids in the class my Dad talked to.  The Veterans for Truth seem to feel Kerry’s milking his experience for political gain and they seem bitter about it seeing how he didn’t support the war after he came home.  So now some of them have changed their stories from what they wrote about Kerry during his Navy Service.  I understand that they are upset, but they need to either just say out and out why they don’t like Kerry and quite switching their stories about what happened 30+ years ago.  Likewise, Kerry’s made his point of comparison with W and I think he can let it go in terms of the campaign.  Besides, Vietnam isn’t the biggest issue this year, and people of my generation know it.  A different war is.

						   Hey, Chris this one's for you.  And it's also for Ros, who complains my posts are too short.  The  urlLink Washington Monthly  has a great new article peripherally about John Kerry's energy policy, but more specifically about getting energy security quickly.  It's unfortunately not one of their online articles, but I think they do put all their features up online once the new issue is out.  If they do post it, I'll link to it.  If you want to pick it up at Borders or some such, it's the one with Ted Turner on the cover.  I'll quote extensively, using my best knowledge of fair use.   Yay! Here's the  urlLink link .   Thanks  urlLink Kevin .  The article, by Sam Jaffe, begins with a slap on the wrist towards Kerry's energy policy, which focuses on energy security through incentives to the auto industry to move to a hydrogen economy by 2020.  Unfortunately, Kerry's solution has not been quite as forward-thinking as his rhetoric.  He wants to provide $10 billion worth of incentives to the U.S. auto industry to encourage automakers to step up their production of advanced vehicles, ignoring the fact that Detroit has been getting similar subsidies for a decade, to little effect. Jaffe then mentions how current projections show a hydrogen economy being hugely expensive, with the technology unlikely to produce less carbon emissions than current hybrid vehicles.  His introduction ends by suggesting that current and right around the corner technologies could eliminate foreign oil dependence by 2020 (an apparently magical date).  The article proper begins with a little history.  In Washington...the word "ethanol" calls to mind billions of dollars in wasteful goverment subsidies and sycophantic paeans to imaginary family farmers.  And for good reason.  Beginning in the late 1970s, the federeal government granted a tax credit at the pump for ethanol-compounded gasoline, plus an income tax credit for small ethanol producers--policies that have cost the taxpayer more than $7 billion in revenue over the last two decades, without much payoff (except to agribusiness). If I may quibble for a moment here.  If the subsidies have been going on since the late 1970s, that's a quarter century, not two decades.  $7 billion divided over 25 years is $280 million a year.  That's a lot of money, but it's not out of hand.  Compare it to any number of federal projects over the last four administrations and it comes out as relatively cheap.  Jaffe's about to make a better point, so I'll shut up...  To provide enough grain-based ethanol to power the economy, notes Cornell agricultural economist David Pimentel, we'd have to use almost all of the farmland in the country just to grow the raw materials. Jaffe goes on a couple paragraphs in this vein, noting how inefficient corn-based ethanol production is and how expensive it is compared to gasoline.  Summary , ethanol not the answer to anything.  But, Jaffe notes, two new technologies have emerged which could make ethanol the answer to just about everything.  The first is an interesting method to produce ethanol not just from the fruit of the plant, i.e. the corn, but the stalks, roots and leaves.  All the more useless crap becomes cellulosic ethanol.   A Canadian biotechnology firm called Iogen, however, has developed a genetically-engineered microbe that processes the cellulose much more easily. This cuts down on cost of raw materials and energy costs when it comes to producing ethanol.  Iogen and Royal Dutch Shell have already investing in a production facility, expected to crank out 100 million gallons a year by 2006.  That's good news.  So here come the nut of the article and I'm gonna quote 'em in full.  I hope that still counts as fair use, because I think it's really important, and I wish WM had put out there for everyone to read.  The prospect of cheap cellulosic ethanol makes it possible to imagine a very different energy landscape.  Since it doesn't require fuel-intensive refining, Iogen's product would provide a net energy gain.  If it becomes competitive with gasoline, we could begin substituting cellulosic ethanol for imported gas.  [excised sentences about specifics]  And while traditional ethanol production requires us to burn our own food, cellulosic production does not.  Indeed, a number of energy crops, including poplar trees and sugar beets can be grown on land unsuitable for food production.  Most intriguing of all is switchgrass, a hardy North American plant that can be raised without irrigation and harvested with a low-labor process similar to mowing the lawn.  In other words, it requires very little energy to bring to harvest compared with ethanol's traditional corn.  According to Cornell's Pimentel, roughly 15 percent of the North American continent consists of land that is unsuitable for food farming but workable for switchgrass cultivation.  Given the typical energy yield of switchgrass, a rough calculation indicates that if all that land were planted with switchgrass, we could replace every single gallon of gas consumed in the United States with gallon of inexpensive, domestically produced and more environmentally-friendly cellulosic ethanol. Okay, but several paragraphs earlier, Jaffe mentions the uncomfortable fact that ethanol produces 33% less energy than gasoline per gallon.  Pretty rough calculation.  It also assumes that this switchgrass production land isn't, you know, completely inaccessible, National Parkland, range land, being swallowed by suburban sprawl and so forth...  I think Jaffe is making an excellent point here, but stretching the argument to it's absolute limit hinders rather than helps.  Cellulosic ethanol is great.  It can reduce dependence on foreign oil.  It's way better than corn ethanol.  Why make an easily targetable silly statement about EVERY SINGLE GALLON OF GAS WE CONSUME?  It just seems counter productive.  The second part of the article deals with how we can use this cheap cellulosic ethanol to move to a hydrogen economy, while sidestepping the main problems of a new hydrogen economy; namely transportation and storage infrastructure due to low energy density.  This part was inherently less interesting to me since the H2 versus EtOH and other candidates thing will be very familiar to anyone who is remotely interested in energy independence and hydrogen power.  It does mention Larry Schmidt's recent breakthrough at the U, where he uses a 5 dollar prototype to crack EtOH into 85% H2.  That's cool and it leads Jaffe to suggest that we should focus on solid state fuel cells, which can use less pure hydrogen, but need some advances in ceramics to withstand the high operating temps required.  In the wrapup, Jaffe talks about the political implications.  Encouraging cellulosic ethanol makes political sense.  Landowners in the Southwest (think swing states Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico) would see their property values rise if switchgrass cultivation became widespread.  And cellulosic ethanol made from castaway plant matter would provide a new source of income for farmers in the Midwest and Plains (the Dakotas, Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana).  That would bring the price of cellulosic ethanol up a bit, but it would still be far cheaper than traditional ethanol made from food crops. I think Jaffe is knowingly downplaying the the upward pressure on land prices (switchgrass prices) and on castaway plant matter.  I don't know any farmers who are just throwing their cellulosic plant matter away right now.  There are a variety of uses around any working farm for that stuff and while selling it might be attractive, the price has to be right.  The price is low right now because demand is low.  Farmers have all the corn stalks they need.  If Royal Dutch Shell starts buying up all the corn stalks, that's gonna put quite a bit of upward pressure on the price, at least until widespread alternative sources (like switchgrass or whatever) come on line.  The article ends with a nice quote from Anne Korin, an analyst at the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, described in the article as an energy policy think tank.  If we wait for the perfect energy technology to be developed, it will take a very long time.  We now have several technologies that work well enough to end all foreign oil imports in ten to fifteen years, but only if we start implementing them right now.  Good stuff.  Any comments, Chris?
