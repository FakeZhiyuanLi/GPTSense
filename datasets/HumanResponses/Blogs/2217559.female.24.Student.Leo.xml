      Okay, it's like 10:45PM, Jen's in the shower and I am waiting to go to some Halloween party. Guess we will see how fun it will be. I have had 5 heinekens and I am feeling all good at this point. Sometimes I think it is just easier to get out of things so i don't have to commit emotionally. I don't what the hell my problem is.  I just kind of freak when things get tough and feel the need to just run from it all.  I think Jason hit it on the nail today when he responded to my email about leaving on a cruiseship.  He said, "Why? Sounds to me like you are running from something."  And I thought to myself, maybe I am.  I ran from Houston to Nac-a-nowhere and then from there to Austin and now to Austin to somewhere out in the middle of the ocean.  Yet I do try and blame it on business- like the contacts i will meet or the moeny I will save to get Bella Rock and SLT off the ground.  Hmm. Who's reading this now? The thoughts roam through my mind like a television that won't turn off. Tomorrow night is Shane's party. We are supposed to go.

      Whoopee! Okay, I got the blog/journal/diary idea from Jennifer after she created an AOL journal. So I did some research online and thought what an excellent tool to have for communication while I am aboard the cruise-ship.   Monday I have my final interview for the first lady position and hopefully I will land the job and move aboard Celebrity cruiselines within the next month or so. Yippee. So, I think this will be a great place for me to post my journals about things that are going on in my life, places I am traveling and people I am meeting.   Happy Halloween, by the way. I have no plans tonight or shall I say I have plans which consist of not really leaving the house. I just want to hang out with Jennifer and throw water balloons at little kids and maybe throw back some beers. Should be fun - sounds as entertaining as anything else. Lord knows sixth street is not where I want to be. I did that last year and that scene was too much for me. Not to mention hearing about the urban legend of the crazed HIV person stabbing people with syringes of blood on Halloween.  That story still gives me the creeps.   SL-T Productions is coming along quite well - for those of you who aren't familiar: This is a production company that I have started with two partners. We are throwing a large xmas party in December at an undisclosed location. We are super excited as we now have an advertising exec, promotions person, catering, sponsorship from local businesses - everything is coming together quite nicely! It will be difficult to leave as things pick up but I am hoping I can persuade people like my hottie friend Shelby to pick up the front lines and step up the plate. She has great people skills and can seriously work with anyone.  My exboyfriend Jason emailed me today. Weird one he is. Never know exactly why we stay in touch. It's not like we are friends. Guess it's just that history, past that we still share in soe weird distant way. Gosh, it's only 2:45PM!! Oh my goodness another hour or more before I can leave. How irritating. I still have this lame office job until I get the final word on the cruiseship (departure date, etc.).   Okay, I am closing this journal for today - more to come soon!! Smooches.

      We arrived in Cabo this morning. Wow, what a beautiful port! I woke up this morning with the bright sun and blue water from my window. I also saw huge rock mountains as well. Do you remember that seen at the end of Goonies right before the big sailboat comes from outside the rocks?  That is what is looks like exactly in Cabo. Just gorgeous white sands, the bluest water you have ever seen and resort style hotels all over the beach. I went to a great restaurant called "The Fish House" and I had a chicken sandwich. hehehe. Seafood is an everyday thing and chicken is a rarity.  Anyway a huge pitcher of Sangria was $9.00 and we didn't even finish it. I did some shopping, rode in a rickshaw an came back to the ship. Pretty uneventful day.   My bosses (9 of them, all greek) played a huge prank on me yesterday. Vassilis, my main boss, called me into his office and told me that as tradition the newcomer had to clean the outside of his windows. So he had a towel and a bottle on windex on his desk. I was almost laughing because I was like, "Ok his office is about 5 feet from the water. Am I going to be hoisted down or what???" He was very serious about it and he told me to report to the staff captain at the bridge at 8 this morning. So all night I was wondering around the ship talking to all the head officers trying to figure who else had done this weird crap before as well.  Everyone was like, oh it's fine. Don't worry about. Only the people that Vassilis likes are invited to do it so you have to do it. THey made up this huge elaborate story about how I would have to sign a release form.  I was thinking, "Are these people f**king crazy??????"  I sent Jen an email immediately telling her all about it. Hahaha. Anyway, I reported to the bridge and all the officers stood there - me in my shorts and tshirt ready to be hoisted down the side of the ship. Vassilis tells me I need to wear my uniform when I do it. (Panty hose, jacket, skirt, blah blah). I turned aorund to go back to my cabin and change when everyone starts laughing saying, "Welcome aboard."  It was some huge big prank on me and of course since I a) so gullible and b) not familiar with the industry - I fell for it.  It was funny though. I was shocked.   Anyway, last night was formal and I had my first night of picking tables and escorting guests. I felt like a diva! I wore like 6-8 grand of diamonds (loaned to me from the onboard jewelry store) and just felt like biggest of best. It was very glamourous and just a blast. It was success and now everyone board knows me as the social hostess. Crew/staff that don't know me personally stop and introduce themselves - it's so flattering and just adorable. The people here are truly wonderful.   I should run though. Busy, busy, busy.    As the greeks say, "Ciao."

      I walked up to the "Bon Voyage" party late yesterday afternoon to take pictures for guests and socialize and I had no idea what I was walking in to.  After just a brief few hours in San Diego, I really wasn't able to notice the beauty of the city until seeing the sunset last night. I was standing outside on the 12th deck high above the water and the sunset was incredible. Blues, reds, oranges just bounced off the sky into the ocean. The sunset had a gorgeous backdrop of the lit city of San Diego. It seemed to just go on forever. The wind was blowing and the boat started to turn - all the while, the black Boyz-to-men-wannabe group in the background singing, "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay."  As cheesey as it sounds I couldn't help but think about how amazing it would be to be taking off on a 10 day cruise with my girl. (Rather than standing there in a fog with nude panty hose on taking pictures for 3 japanese people who don't speak any English. No kidding, the man pointed to the button on his camera and said, "Shot." instead of shoot.)  It was nonetheless a breath taking moment. Just right before the sun went away, that moment of silence. The first bit I have had since my departure. In a sea of people that one moment at glance of the sky, just took me away.

      I am half way through this very long day of greeting guests, dealing with complaints and walking elder folks up the stairs. It was been a busy busy busy busy busy - oh did I mention, busy? day. I have met all of my VIPs except for 3 suites and I am going up to their rooms within the next half hour - well, after we finish the "Titanic Boat Drill" anyway.  Oh bother, gotta go solve a crisis. More soon.

      So, 10:00PM last night I was at the computer checking guest information about my next table to seat and I get a call from my boss. He says, "Shelly, get over to my office now." It was a stern voice and I started trying to figure out why I would alreayd be in trouble. I hauled ass over to his office as fast my heels could carry me. I walked in and there was my boss, Vassilis and 12 others girls in his office drinking wine. He says, "Why you don't come join us for wine more often?"  (In his broken greek english translation).  I was really surprised. So I sat down and we drank a toast to another successful cruise and to my new hire. It was awesome.   After my everyone left the formal dining hall, Kimberely (the other social hostess that's leaving tomorrow) and I went to a nice seating with all of the Mai'tra-des (however your spell it).  It was awesome. We had a formal dinner with lobster and some great cheese. It was a yummmy meal. In fact, the same that all of the VIP guests ate earlier. It was very nice of them to invite us and I was invited to attend next cruise as well. Afterwards, I hung out in the disco last night for awhile. The Asst hotel manager joined my table of 4 and so we sat there and drank some champagne. I didn't drink to much though as I didn't want to feel like hell today. It's pretty cool though - when an officer is seated at your table, all of your drinks go on his tab regardless. Not bad. Anywho, I stayed for awhile and then went to my cabin.   Today I take over everything - the mobile phone, pager and every other responsibility of the social hostess position. I am excited and certain things will go well. Oh also! I am moving to a new office in January where I will be facing a huge window of the ocean all day! Isn't that incredible? It's going to be super nice. I have met some really cool friends on board that keeping me entertained - like a woman named "Uma" from Canada and another girl named Stephanie. I hung out with them a bit last night and it was good fun.   Today doesn't feel like Thanksgiving for me. I guess I had my Thanksgiving dinner last night. I hope everyone is doing well. Know that I miss you all so much and I hope you have a lovely day with friends and family.   See you soon, Shelly

      Tonight is my first night to don the party gown and walk to the walk of the first lady.  Our main dining room has a huge cascading staircase that leads to the captain's table. I will be escorting the guests down these eletgant stairs in front of all of the other seated guests.  This ship really reminds me of the titanic and everytime i think about being onboard I think of that damned ship. Weird.  anyway, I am excited about tonight. I am going to take a nap this afternoon as I will be working until after midnight tonight. I have to host the "Grand Buffet" at 11:30PM and introduce all of the international chefs. Wish me luck on name pronounciation.   So, thanksgiving isn't really being celebrated on board. In fact, I had completely forgotten about the holiday until I received an email from Jennifer this morning. I hope everyone has a great holiday break and eats lots of food. Good food. The officer messroom food is yuck and makes me have owie tummy. (Dannielle & Christina know what this is).   We have two days at sea so we areactually right now about 750 miles south of San Diego. We will arrive at that port on Friday morning and will pick up new passengers!   wots of wuv, Shell

      Ughhhhh, okay, I feel like hell today.  I woke up at 9:00Am to the sound of this horrible alarm clock that I bought.  Man, I just want to throw that thing in the hall when it goes off.  It is soooooooooo loud. Anyway, I got to formally meet the captain this morning and what an interesting character. He's a drunk - I mean seriously. I went in there at 10AM and he was having a scotch. Everyone smokes cigarettes in their offices. It's weird. Must be a foreign thing. Anyway, I got to see the bridge of the ship when  went to visit with the captain. It was incredible. Today, we are in Manzanillo. I haven't gone into port today because I have been kind of busy this morning. I had to give a guided tour of the ship to our port agents - about 30 hispanic people that speak no english. It was a lot of hand gestures and oooohhs and awwwss. Hehehe. It was fun though. The people were very nice and very impressed with our ship.  Tonight we have this latin dance thing in the Navigator Disco club upstairs.  Apparently, it's a huge thing for staff but I have a big day tomorrow so i don't know if I will go. I have to work unitl around 11 tonight anyway. Tomorrow night is my first formal.  Pretty exciting. I haven't figured out what I will wear just yet.   Today is discount day in the spa so I am having an hour long massage for really cheap. I am going at 3:00.  God, I remember those days at ECI when 3:00 was the kiss of death on a Tuesday - just getting out of staff meetings. THis kjob is a breeze so far. My boss - the hotel manager or "the hotman" as well call him is awesome. I went in to see him this morning and he said, "Here, sit with me for awhile."  We talked about his family, blah blah, he smoked a lot of cigarettes and said the f-word a lot. It was great. The best conversation I have ever had with a boss.   Oh yeah, we have a tranzee on board. Her name is Julianna and apparently when she was on the ship before she was a man. Guess we know what she said her money for.  She doesn't like the social hostess because the cruise master told her that they would neve rhire her for this position. Poor thing. I am nice ot her though. Hahaha.  Let's see what else. Hmm... oh we have time changes too.  Tonight we go back an hour and then tomorrow night another hour.  I am kind of confuse don what day it is and the time. This is just the most awesome job ever. It really does not feel like I am working at all. I haven't gotten sea sick yet but if i have another hangover I might. i ave felt really queesey today for sure. Maybe the massage will make it better.  Love you all - more soon.  Shell

      Just got in from an incredible evening of hanging out with crazy people.  I met the art auctioneirre who auctions art from rembrandt, picasso & pete ward?  It was soo incredible - he told me all about the story of pete. I will get the artist information for the site but his work goes for over 18K per painting. We are working a trade deal where i solicit my VIPs and vice versa. It was fun.  Tonight was my first night in the "Staff Bar" and it should have been labeled the gay bar because everyone in there was gay - male though.  I met an incredible waiter from south africa who was just beautiful. His name ios Julias and his girlfriend is aboard. He is way cool even though he has a MAJOR uni-brow. I6t was fun though-  I had a few glasses of wine, and then went downstairs with the gays. Hehehehe. My ship is weird - I am learning that the "cruise life" is much different from any other. Everyone I meet is either leaving in a week or here until January.  I miss my family and when I say family I mean friends and blood. I mean hello, it's 2:30AM and I am at my computer writing. I miss my Jennifer so much. There are no women on board that I am interested in. None. And the men - well, they are greeek or british and all are mostly gay. I will have a hangover tomorrow for sure, so i may not write. Blah blah blha. I am going to run outside smoke a smoke and then go to sleep. No cabin sickness yet but hell if I drink any more tonight there will be sickness in general.  Oh remind me to tell y0ou about Jason the singer. He's fucking awesome.   Okay, sign off for now, Paddy. Love you guys and miss you terribly.  Please don't forget about me.   Your shipboard social hostess,  Shelly

      Hey peeps! Just wanted to send a quick note and let you know I am doing great. I am learning a lot and working so much1 I was able to go into port today and check out this small town of Ixtapa. It was really cool! I had lunch at this place called "the fat mermaid."  (And trust, there were pictures of really fat mermaids everywhere!)  I had two coronas and took the tender back to the boat. Had a couple of hours off and I am now back at work untl aorund 9. My schedule rocks!!  I make my hours and I get to hang out with tons of people. My cabin is okay right but I will moving into the current social hostess' room once she leaves on Friday. It is really really small. Why oh why did i bring so many clothes! I am meeting tons of people and my ship is huge. I am one of 10 americans on board- most everyone else is greek, russian, asian - it's really fun. My hotel manager is nice. I am considered an officer so I get to eat in the officer messroom. (Kind of like the navy, ey?) I keep getting lost on the ship though! There are 12 floors! It is soooo big!   Tomorrow we head to Manzanillo and it should be really fun. I am going to the beach with my coworker for most of the day and then I will work tomorrow night. Guys, this job is the best job I have ever had! Oh and for all the smokers out there - I bought a carton of smokes on board for $14.00. Everyone smokes!!!   All my love to everyone - I miss you all so much! Hi Paddy! Take care and please write when you can - shelly_marie_white@yahoo.com.

      Ok, Michael Jackson is really weird. We can all agree on this right?  I think that this story is just incredible. Is he really serious when he says that people are trying to sabotage his new album?  Did anyone even know he had one coming out?  FREAK!  Okay on to better topics....  I had the best dinner last night. I ate so much I could hardly move. My grandmother cooked turkey and dressing, potato casserole, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce, venison, ham and my favorite - cherry cheese cake. Oh gosh, I should have thrown up last night because I feel like a giant cow today. Hehehe. It was wonderful and very touchable of her to cook for me.   I also got to hang out with my little cousin for awhile. I say my little cousin but she's 19 now.  We drove to the Target (30 miles away) and went shopping. I bought the In The Zone by Britney Spears - YES, I DID. I couldn't resist it - she was just sitting on the shelf looking so hot and it was 9.98.  I bought it and it might possibly be the worst album I have ever heard. Hahaha.  I guess I will listen to it a little bit more- or for as long as I can stand it. Well, after shopping my cousin stopped by this beer place and picked up some tall-boy coors lights. we drove to her school (K-12 are housed here) and sat in the parking drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and catching up. (We couldn't come back to my grandparents! Drinking is forbidden. Hahah). So we A beer and I came back to my grandparents and jumped into my favorite bed - huge cotton mattress.  I sunk in and slept until 7:00 this morning. It was a great day yesterday. I have really had an awesome time spending time with my family.   Okay, more so. Bye Paddy.

      I drove to Houston yesterday and it was the hardest drive I think I have ever had to take. I left Jennifer's at noon and I drove away watching her stand in her driveway waving bye. I wanted to turn around about hundred times before I hit 71. I miss her so much already. We must have talked on the phone 5 times yesterday.  I woke up this morning at my house in Houston and I just felt like a complete freak. I can't believe I am just days away from leaving everything I know. Leaving Austin wa sby far the hardest moment for me. I kept having to say goodbye to all of my friends, one last lunch appointment, one last dinner, one last phone call. I never thought I would ever be so tired of saying goodbye in my life. And the thing that gets me is that everyone that is in my life are in my life for a reason and I will always cherish that. I am not saying "goodbye" forever, just for a little while.   I am heading to my grandparents farm today. 400 acres of land - the air is so fresh and so clean.  (Isn't that a song?  So fresh and so clean..) I can't wait to see my Nana and Papa.  Tonight is our Thanksgiving dinner. I think I will leave Houston around 10 this morning so I can have a full day with them.   Hmm, so yesterday when I was leaving Austin I was driving down Congress headed towards Ben White. All i could see was the capital in my rearview mirror. What an interesing view it was. I remember when I first got to Austin and the way I felt when I first saw that tall building. It was a feeling of a new beginning for me. I kept thinking of all the different things I have experienced, all the people I have met over the years and it was just a very weird feeling to have leaving. I am excited about my future for the first time in a LONG time. No more secretary-go-get-me-this work. Thank God! I can't wait for my new venture. This is going to be awesome.   So, Paddy...I miss you!  And my Lisa, AJ, Charity, Jackie, Dannielle, Christina, Kevin, Starnes!, Tammy, Deborah - Joe? Okay, not him. I miss everyone!! I can't wait to send postcards to all of you!  Long live the Ex-ECI Association!

      So, I have a wonderful evening last night.  Jennifer and I had dinner with my friends Dannielle and Christina - Mac-N-Grill. Yummy. We ate too much though and I had to force Jennifer to take Rollaids. It was funny. I enjoyed spending time with Dannielle and Christina. They are just the sweetest people in the world and they have such an incredible relationship. I just love it! Thanks guys for spending some time with me before leaving.  I haven't seen AJ since Sunday but he calls me today and tells me he broke his toe yesterday morning. Bummer!  He's having xrays but the doctor doesn't think it is broken. Thank goodness- he may still be able to danc ein the Nutcracker this fall. Oh I am going to miss the ballet season this year - :-( Oh well, I maybe I can see some water ballet or something. Hahaha.  Everything is packed and ready to go. I got my apartment leased and someone is moving in this weekend. I am so relieved to get this information.  Otherwise I was going to be paying for an apartment that I didn't live in. Ugh, that would suck!  Sorry it's been so long since I have written. It's been very busy preparing for my leave. I have my new hire checklist meeting on Friday afternoon and I will get my travel arrangements then! I am excited- Saturday is approaching fast.   Tata titi, more soon.  Shelly

      Well, this is my last Friday in Austin. Feels weird. My last weekend here is approaching. Tonight after work I will celebrate my new job with all of my friends from ECI - none of them work here anymore with the exception of just a few.  Then I must head home and do a mad dash to pack the remainder of my stuff before the movers arrive tomorrow. I am getting nervous. Getting a little anxious. It's coming to fast and not fast enough if that makes any sense.   I spent last night hanging with Jen. She took me to dinner at Brick Oven and then we just hung at her place afterwards. I am going to miss her so much. I think it is just now sinking in for the both of us.  She is really an incredible girl who has forever changed the way I look at things in my life.  And I guess having people in your life that inspire you to be a better person are always a great addition.    My going away party is tomorrow night. At the lounge. I am excited. It will be a little difficult knowing that this will be the last time I see all of my friends for 6 months, maybe a little longer depending on where everyone else is when I get back. I am going to enjoy the evening and their company tremendously. My mom and Richard come into town tomorrow and I am excited to visit with them.  They are going to help me with my move - well, basically, I think mother is going to help me pack. She know sI am not very good at it and if I don't have any advice I will wind up with 20 pairs of shoes, 1 pair of panties and no toothpaste. Hahahah.  Sunday I am going shopping at the Tanger Outlet mall. I have a few more things to purchase before leaving - like some formal dresses. I enjoy shopping there a lot although I don't get to often because it is in San Marcos and well, I don't like San Marcos.   Okay, guess I better slap my harness back on and start being slave driven. I have to spend the morning working with my favorite asshole of ECI, Joe Kelly. Ewww, what a jerk.  He's the biggest.....blah blah blah - ok, I am not being very nice here. Trust he's a total jerk.

      Have you ever encountered something that completely freaks you out from your inner core? Something you can't possibly explain - your brain can't even make sense of the event? Well, I experienced something of the sorts last night and I feel really bizaare today....  11:00PM at Jennifer's house. Laying in bed watching tv, chit-chatting about nothing. We decided to go to bed and so we turned off the tv and Jennifer tried to turn on the lamp next to her bedside to set the alarm clock. The room was pitch black and when she tried to turn on the lamp next to her bedside, the lamp would not turn on.  She said, "Crap, the light bulb is out."  So she turned the overhead light on and made sure the lamp was plugged in, set the alarm and laid back down. I was laying there just thinking about work and a thousand other things when all of a sudden THE LAMP FLICKERED ON. I was like, What the hell? So, naively, I tell Jennifer to stop joking around and just turn on the light.  (The overhead was still on at this point).  She unplugged the lamp and we just layed there, thinking how weird was that.  3 minutes later.  We were settling in, saying goodnight and the lamped flicker again.  Difference this time is that the LAMP WAS COMPLETELY UNPLUGGED.  I am not kidding you - the lamp was unplugged. And power was going through it.  It flickered about 4 times and I got so freaked out that I sat directly up in bed, made Jennifer turn on the light and I just stared at the lamp.   Okay, keep in mind, I am compeltely freaked by things like this. Jen was calm, cool and collected and was like, "It's okay, Shelly. This stuff happens all the time. Watch this."  I am just looking at her like she's crazy at this point. She continues, yelling into the middle of blank air:   "Can you do it again? I am going to count to five and I want you to make the light blink." "1, 2, 3, 4, Blink!"  During the pause between 4 & blink the unplugged lamp blinked twice.  And we both looked at each other like OMG.  She repeated...  "1, 2, 3, 4, Blink!" And once again the unplugged lamped flickered twice.   Now my brain can't really compute what happened last night. I have never truly believed in ghosts but last night I know something was in her bedroom making the UNPLUGGED lamp flicker on and off and Jennifer communicated openly with the uninvited guest. It was really really freaky. I couldn't go to sleep. I was terrified. So I made Jennifer talk to me until 3AM. I just layed there with my head barely uncovered peeking out to the closet and surrounding walls every so often.  Jennifer was cool and really managed to calm me incredibly but it was so weird. I just felt weird. And today I feel even more weird.   We nicknamed the ghost, Blinky.  Blinky blinky blinky. Don't think I am going to stay Jennifer's tonight. Eeeeeekkk!!! How weird. Patched a few paranormal links for peeps:    urlLink   Amy's got ghosts too.

      Paddy Langford is the coolest guy I know. He has got to be one of the funniest people I have ever met. Quick witted and you would know how he was unless he told you. (I know but I won't share that info here). I think I will share some of my funniest times with Paddy:  1. The Missing Bevo - Paddy had a litt e plastic bevo stuck on the side of his cube during the entire he worked with me at ECI. One day, Bevo was mysterious gone. Paddy began getting Polaroid photos of his Bevo in different places around our office, building and parking lot. Bevo was seen dangling from our balcony, laying in the grass by our company sign, wearing an A&M sweater, stuck in the FedEx drop box - it was just awful.  Every few hours another picture would surface on his desk.  This was probably the most I have laughe din a long time. Finally paddy made Xerox copies of dollar bills and paid the ransom to get his bevo back. Everyone in the office was privy to this game of steal the bevo from Paddy. It was great.  2. The UT/Oklahoma Game - Lisa and I went to Paddy's house to watch the game in his huge living with his huge TV and eat his mother's food. We get there and Paddy is so nervous about the game that he can't even sit down. He was just pacing the floor.  It was so funny. I got to see Paddy in his home environment (which I had never seen before).  I got to hear the google noises he makes for his dogs. It was really funny. When UT got the crap beat out of them (was it 65-13??), paddy was devastated - although - I must say, his mom was in more disgust than Paddy. She was just over it! Completely over it. I laughed so hard.  Anyway, paddy rocks and I am going to miss him.  He can't get on my ship though. Because then I would kill him.  I can just see it now, "Shelly, can you get me this? Shelly, I need you to pick up some of this." Blah blaah blah blah...

      it hit me last night like a ton of bricks. A ton of bricks. I had my normal Monday night meeting with Starnes & Tammy at Sullivan's and finished up around 7:ish. We had a great meeting - everything is coming together nicely.  After I went home as Lucy and Darren both said they wanted to hang out but neither one called so I just continue where I left off on my packing once I got home.  I must have lsitened to Sade's cd "Lovers Rock" about 3 times when I decided to give my old buddy Clint a call.  He used to work with me at ECI but was unfortunately fired back in April. We were very close friends and since I haven't heard from him in a long time I decided to give him a buzz and tell him about my new job and turning in resignation notice.  We ended up being on the phone for about 30 minutes and he invited me over to have a few beers with him.  So, I went over to his place around 9 and he was playing some retarded online shoot-em up game on his computer. We hung out, caught up and it was a lot of fun.  I left his place around 11 and headed home.   I talked to AJ on my way home and he wanted to hang out, so we did.  I love him soooo much. I am going to miss him more than he can imagine. It's hard to believe that we have only been friends for about 4 years - it seems like I have known him my entire life. We were joking last night that our international phone calls are going to be outrageous.  I told him that he HAS to come to San Diego to visit me when I am in port. My baby!!  Anyway, here I am this morning at ECI, not working as usual. It's boring here. I am over it. I am ready to go. My boss, Jeff, just left a little bit ago for another all day meeting at our corporate office. That's a good thing. Blah blah blah.  I miss my Jennifer. I didn't get to see her last night because she had plans with Heidi and Kim.  I hope I can see her tonight.  I just want to go to her house and curl up beside her on the sofa and watch tv. Or jump into her big huge king size bed and sleeeeep. Yummy!

      So, I just got back from a very refreshing weekend at home visiting my family. It was awesome. I got the call from Caron Grant (my recruiter) on Friday afternoon at the airport curbside check-in at 5:01PM.  We played phone tag through security check points until I finally got to my terminal and was able to write down details. I leave November 22nd for Acapulco. I will be meeting my ship there as this particular cruise leaves on the 17th (which is when she initially wanted me to go). So, I got the news and called my mother, my grandmother, AJ and Lisa then Paddy. Wouldn't called Jen but I knew she was driving and I couldn't reach her on her cell. Then after those phone calls, reality started to sink - OMG, I am leaving in less than 14 days. Leaving, like packing up and leaving. I got home yesterday and started packing after a wonderful visit with my mom and Richard. I took a lot of things off the wall, actually did my dishes and began to get organized.  I wish I was inspector gadget or mary poppins so I could shrink things for my suitcase. I can't imagine not taking all of my clothes!!!!  Jen called me about 7:00 and I went to meet her at hoooooooters.  We drank some beer and then well went to anotherplace but we won't discuss that. It was fun nonetheless.   Tonight, I have a meeting with Tammy & Starnes to discuss the party in December. The party I will not be here to help host. Awwwww. How sad. They will do a great job I am sure. And when I get back we will show them how it really gets done. Hahahahahah. Just kidding.  But you know, I have been thinking about that a lot too.  6 weeks paid vacation is a long time. I am thinking I will rent a villa in Italy and invite all my close friends to come meet me there. Maybe I will take a language intensive course and learn Italian so I can communicate with the locals. How funnnnnn.  I am so excited about leaving. Nervous and sad but I know that my friends and family will be here when I get home.

      Oh man, what a week. I am so glad it's Friday. A little tired today but nothing can break this smile off my face - I haven't been home to Houston in months and months. Mom and I are going to dinner tonight and then just hanging out, going shopping tomorrow.  She is really excited about my new job and I am too. I can't wait to break the news to this crap-ass place. (ECI).  I got into a little baby brawl with Joe this morning - such an asshole. I just hate the way he talks to people in general and so that makes me really short with him. I can't stand him. I don't know how he has made it so far in life with the kind of attitude that he has. Blah blah, enough about him.  Last night I hung out with some friends, had a few beers and just enjoyed one of my last Thursday night in Austin. I sat there at the bar reflective over the 4 years I have spent in Austin - the relatioships I have formed, the friendships I never thought I would make, the career decisions - interesting where we end up after a certain period of time. I always thought Leah and I would be together forever....and then I thought Brian would be my roommate forever.... blah blah.    Jeez, I am bored. I am going to search the net for a little while.

      Good morning. I think this is the longest week I have had in awhile.  Yesterday was probably the longest day of my life though. More details of that sure to come.   I am excited about going home tomorrow. Just counting down the hours. I am so ready to get out of this town for the weekend. I need a break from everyone and everything. I need a vacation - guess I will be having one of those soon. Hehehe. I have told my grandmother that I am coming this weekend. I was thinking of surprising her. I don't know though -I know she has a lot going on this weekend so maybe I will go ahead and call her this afternoon.   I am still waiting for Royal Carribean to call me about my ship assignment. Hopefully they will call today or tomorrow. I hate waiting! I think I am th emost impatient person ever. I haven'tt alked to Jennifer today. Wonder what she's doing? Hmmm.

      My meeting was successful last night with Tammy and Starnes. We had a graphic designer meet us at the Whisky Bar and we were able to nail down a lot of great ideas for the design of our company logo and website. The website should be up and running hopefully within the next few days and I will post a link once that happens.  I know Tess (graphic designer) will do a great job. I got home last night and just layed on the couch...watched TV.  I was exhausted after such a long day. AJ gave me a ride this morning to work and that was really nice. I know he hates it because it is so out of the way for him but he loves me and that helps.  I booked an airline ticket yesterday to go home for the weekend. I fly into Hobby about 6:30 and I am so excited to go home to visit with my mom and Richard. I was thinking of driving to my grandparents' on Saturday but I just learned today that my grandmother is hosting my grandfather's high school reunion at their house and so I guess they will be really busy. I may just go to hang out with my aunt char and other family members. I miss them all so much. It seems like forever since I have gone and spent time with them. My grandparents' farm is incredible. 400 acres of land, cows, tractors, dogs, crafts and lots of comfort food.  I usually go at Thanksgiving for about 4 days but looks like this year I will be on a cruise ship by then. I think my grandmother is planning to have Thanksgiving early for me which is incredibly sweet.  I am sad about leaving my babies - Jennifer and AJ. They are the two most important people in my life.  Jennifer and I have grown so close over the last four months.  I will miss her so much.  I have so many fears about leaving for 6 months - like will everything change between us?  I know we will stay in touch and I just hope that what we have is still here when I return.  I know long distance relationships don't carry the best track record but maybe we will be the exception.  (Although I don't think I have ever had a long distance relationship).  I told AJ this morning about my cruise job on the way into work.  He was really sad and I know that my leaving will be hard on him. We have been very close friends for about 3 years now and have grown to treat each other as brother and sister. He really has been a great friend to me and I know that I will miss him and our friendship most of all.  I will miss all the lazy afternoons and evenings of us hanging out and being stupid.  Making retarded noises, laughing uncontrollably and just being silly kids. He truly is one of the only people I have met in my life that I can share my most ridiculous side with.   I have my bible study tonight - unfortunately, I don't think I am going to make it. This no-car having crap is for the birds. I can't even get where I really NEED to go. Hehehe.  Mom's giving me a car this weekend so all my problems of transportation will soon be gone. Yippee!

      So, I just completed the interview for the First Lady job.  And I got it! Leaving in 3 weeks for some unknown destination.  I should be getting a call with details in the next 3 days from the HR Director, Catherine. I am very excited. I have waited for an opportunity like this most of my life and to have it be sitting right in front of me now if mind boggling.  I will be leaving friends, family and business relationships to meet all new friends, family & business relationships.  I am excited about the culture I will gain and the world knowledge of an experienced traveler. I guess snow I wait again. I remember my first phone interview for this job almost one month ago.  Never did I expect to actually be leaving on a cruisehip shortly thereafter. I have so much to do and so much to plan for - packing up my apartment, putting things in storage, subletting my apartment, turning in my two weeks at ECI, telling sugarback, planning a going away party - getting my passport, taking a physical - 3 weeks just doesn't seem long enough. But maybe it is - if it was any longer I may change my mind. Right now there is just a lot of excitement around the whole job.  I am sure when I get there I will miss everyone greatly - especially Jennifer. I think we have both tried desperately to forget about the cruisejob and really just think about the time we currently have but now that there is a deadline approaching that shifts the focus incredibly. I am anxious to hear back from everyone. I wonder what clothes I will bring, what food I will eat and what interesting coworkers I will have. Wow, now I can daydream for another 3 weeks. (Not like I haven't already been doing that since October 1st).   Oh but wait, reality is still here. I have to go to the doctor today to hopefully get my staples out of my head and then I will head to Tammy's to drop off her vehicle and go to my regular boring day job at ECI. Meeting tonight to talk about SLT Productions which I guess I will not be here to see the result of all of our hardwork and planning.  Oh well, there will be plenty of opportunities for me to do the same in the future.  I am soooo excited!!!

      Sunday mornings, oh I love them. I just woke up a few minutes ago. A little groggy but not too bad as I didn't drink very much at Shane's party last night. It was fun although I must say I never knew he had such INTERESTING friends.  Mostly his brother's friends, I think.  His brother is 19 and boy what an age difference that is. I felt old last night. 24. Bah hum bug. I found my self remenising over high school days, friends and parties. =  Didn't make it to church this morning. I just felt like sleeping in and I think Jennifer is throwing a bar b que at her house this afternoon to watch some football game with friends. I have toget ready for my webcam interview tomorrow! Ohh - wonder what I will wear??!?! I am sure i will find something. I was going to put the hawaiian background up behind me but I didn't find time to actually go purchase one this weekend. Guess I will find something out.

      This afternoon iss just dragging. I wanted to take a nap this afternoon but it doesn't look like it's possible as it is already 2:20 and I have my first table at 5:55pm. And of course I have all the last minute preparations to wrap up as well so I am still in the office. Right now, I am waiting on some guests to call me back and tell me if they are accepting the invitation. Anyway, blah blah - nothing new since this morning.

      "Damn, baby, what did you do to yo hair?"  I don't even know what day of the week it is, I swear.  I think it is Saturday. The Captain and I were speaking th eother day and he asked me what day it was and I didn't have a clue. Literally no idea what day of the week it is.  It's irevlevant here.  We work everyday so it's not we are looking forward to a weekend.   Last night was fun. I was invited to the greek bar-b-que on Deck 4 Aft. My friend Fotis came and picked me up from my office and took me there. I got there around 9:30ish and when I arrived there was tons of food, lots of beer and all of the senior officers. I was one of 4 girls there. We sat there, talked and drank for a couple of hours. The greek officer danced a lot and I sat there making fun of them. It was a blast. After we all went to the crew bar for a bit and I hung out with my German friend, Felix. I am learning lots of greek words and some german because of my friends on board. I go for my daily "greek" lesson every afternoon. My friend Zoe gives me four new words a day, 3 good and 1 bad. Hehehehe. I am learning slowly, which I guess is the best way.   Tonight is formal. Again. I am so tired today. These people are killing me. I need lots of sleep sleep sleep. All I see are Z's right now.

      Wow, I had a great day.  I slept without knowing what time it was actually. We had an hour forward last night and I totally forgot. So, I woke up this morning about 9, lounged in bed for a bit and then Lisa called me saying, "Where are you girl??" It was actually 10:20AM. Hahaha. I freaked and threw on my uniform and ran upstairs to find tha tno one cared I was in at 10.  What a great feeling. No running to ECI like I used to do. Anyway, I worked until 1ish and then Lisa and I went to Playa Caracol to do some shopping. I was able to log onto AOL instant messenger to talk with ym mom and grandmother. It was really cool. Anyway, I didn't buy anything really - just some vitamin E, toothpaste and a new lipgloss. Lisa shopped like crazy but something about Mexico clothes jsut really turns me off. Besides, the only place I will wear these new clothes is to the crew bar and I am not trying to impress anyone there. Hahaha. Long story short, I was back at the ship by about 3:30 and back at my desk by 4.  I have had a great evening though. Lisa and I have been cracking up left and right about random stuff. We decided to have a "Shell Sister" reunion tonight with our friend Kim in the crew bar. Kim has been working the night shift for about 11 days so she is finally joining the real world again during the daytime. So, I guess we will go there, gossip, drink a few beers and go to bed. Tomorrow is a sea day which means we will all be really busy. I have 3 functions and a formal tomorrow.   Anyway, I hear that the crew gets a huge buffet dinner tomorrow night. It's an international feast where they cook each countries favorite dishes. I can hardly wait to see what they come up with for the US. =Hahah=  Lisa always jokes about me being a "dumb American" but I snap back at her about her "soreys and aboots" as she is Canadian.  We have so much, I swear. Just retarded fun.   Christmas day we are in Acapulco and I am helping out with a wedding -well, actually planning the wedding. Just call me, "Shelly the Wedding Planner."   I hope everyone is enjoying the much needed time off with friends and family. I miss everyone so much but fortunate for me I have made some great friendships on board. We are sharing christmas presents and we have plastic trees in our offices, etc. Not too shabby - definitely not close to being at home but a good try.   Lots of love, Shelly

      Whew, what a hectic past few days. This Christmas Cruise is crazy insane. Today things slowed drastically and I needed the rest. I odn't know if  could have gone on. I woke up this morning worked for a few hours and then went to my cabin and went back to sleep. Had lunch around 1:00 when Lisa and I headed to Cabo for our favorite spot, Pueblo Vielo. Our waiter recognized us immediately and took special care of us as if he knew how much we had worked since the last time we saw him. We had some amazing food and then headed to the mall to do some shopping. There was some football/soccer/baseball (heck, I don't know what sport) victory in Cabo so all the locals were driving around honking with red jerseys hanging out their window. It was funny - we were cracking up. We got back about 4 and I havejust kind of been playin catch up this afternoon.  I had after dinner drinks with the producer of the Ellen Show and her family. Very well connected family!  I am looking forward to spending more time with them throughout this cruise.  She gave me her card and told me anytime I was in the Burbank area that I could get VIP tickets to Ellen's show.  Pretty neat! Apparently there's a 6 month waiting list as is and she said that she would love to have me there to meet everyone.  I really thought that was nice of her to offer.  We talked a lot about the show and Ellen and it was just interesting to meet someone who worked with one of the greatest. Alas, I just retired from that meeting and now i am jsut blogging and checking email.  I met a really nice couple on the last cruise that emailed me today.  They were so incredible. I am really looking forward to all of the guest relationships I am building onboard. Very fun.   Tonight wehave our crew Christmas party - not as elegant as the passengers as I hear we will be served Pizza and Beer. Guess we can't ask for much more. Hahaha. That is definitely one of the most interesting Christmas dinners I have had. Nonetheless, I am sure it will be fun.   My familyis the greatest. I received all of my christmas presents yesterday with a card signed by all.  My grandpa left the funniest message on my card. He said watch out for the scary men.  It was funny, I laughed really hard. And then I cried. It was really depressing to be sitting on my bed all alone in my cabin opening my presents by myself.  Esecially after I had a glimpse of the contents when the security guard checked my packages for bombs. I told the security officer, Ita that i was glad we could share that moment together. (Very sarcastically).  None theless, all of my packages from Jennifer and family were much appreciated and very much needed. I felt very loved and missed and I guess that warmed my spirit enough for Christmas.   Gotta run now. Ciao as we say here.  Best wishes to all for a safe and Merry Christmas.   Shelly

      Just started a new cruise today and what a nightmare. 400 kids on board. No kidding. No geriatrics on board but we are all wishing they would come back now. These people are frekaing insane. We actually have 3 little girls staying in one of the penthouses. We lost one of their Louis Vouton bags and now the mother is having a fit. It's ridiculous the crap we deal with. Oh the boat was delayed leaving today because one of the parents on board caught their 18 year old son with drugs. They called th epolice to escort him and take him to jail. It was crazy insane. So I guess that kid will spend Christmas in jail. Meanwhile, I had dinner with the producer of the Ellen Degeneres Talk Show tonight. Very nice lady. We have a formal meeting tomorrow afternoon as she is interested in shooting some footage and interviewing people on board. Should be very exciting and might even get my face on camera at some point.   I had a couple tonight demand potato pancakes for dinner every night for hannuaka. Jewish ceremonies all over the ship for the next 10 days and kids are running aorund with walkie talkies yelling and screaming to the top of their lungs. Man, I want the old people back. We thought they were bad!!!!  Let's see what else. I am very tired today. I came in to the office at 4:15 this morning and worked until 5:45AM. I couldn't sleep so I came up to my office in my pajamas and printed invitations, yaddi yadda yada. It was weird being awake and working at that time.   I guess everyone is getting geared for Christmas. To be honest, I can't wiat for it to be over and get these hellions off our ship. Little satan children. What kind of child whose 12 carries a louis voutton????  a $1,000 suitcase????  Ugh, don't get me started.  Oh Kevin Dobson is on board this cruise. For those of you not familar, he is an actor who plays Governor Brooks on One life to live. (He also stared in Kojac for 5 seasons as well.)  Pretty interesting.   Tonight, Lisa and I are going to have a few beers in the crew bar. We are going to sit there and destress from this hellish day. Tomorrow is formal AGAIN and then finally a day at port where life becomes simple again.  Love you all - well, excpet one question, Paddy - did you really REALLY go to Joe's Christmas party????? What the hell were you thinking?   Lots of love,  Shelly

      Hello, all. How's it going? Things are great here as usual. Today we are in Mazatlan and it's beautiful weather. Warm (about mid 80's), breezey and sunny. The Shell Sisters and I are going out today to a resort about 20 minutes outside of Mazatlan. Apparently the whole staff of the ship tries ot make it out there to play volleyball, drink coronas and just veg for about 3 hours. The ship leaves at 5 so we have ot be back by 4:30pm.  Yesterday was awesome. I met th emost amazing couple at the beginning of this cruise and I was able to give them a private bridge tour with the Captain yesterday afternoon. The woman, very attractive, in her mid forties is a pilot. She has been flying planes for over 25 years. And her boyfriend, well he's a photographer for Better Homes & Gardens. Just awesome - really awesome people who really liked me a lot. After the private bridge tour (which i will discuss momentarily), they invited me back to the royal suite for a couple glasses of wine. We sat and tlake dofr baout an hour and half and it was just awesome. Wonderful people that I most definitely will stay in touch with.   The bridge tour was the first I have given. It was very cool though as it took place right at sailing so we were able to see how the ship gets moving and all the commands needed to get clearance. Inside the bridge, greek is spoken. The navigational officer took us around each side of the bridge and told us specifics about our ship and it's operations. It was very neat. Not to mention the view! Next time you are on a cruise, A) Find the social hostess and schmooze her (that's me) B) Ask the social hostess or other officers on board for a private bridge tour.  C) Ask to dine at the Captain's table. If you get to do any of these things while on board, you are a member of the elite few who have.   After visiting with the great folks in the Royal Suite, I received a call from the women in the penthouse. They invited me up to hang out and have ANOTHER glass of wine. I accepted and spent about an hour hanging with the two of them. It was really fun. I had to go to come down to my office and have a meeting with my hotel manager after that. It was fine though. I wans't tanked or anything. I must say we have had some wonderful guests on board for this cruise. Definitely met a few people that I will stay in touch with. Can you imagine this every two weeks? Meeting more and more people? Wow. One group leader I met with earlier in the cruise, gave me 15 baseball caps and a $75 gift certificate to a fancy restaurant in San Diego. When these people are nice, they are VERY nice.   Well, not much more news other than that. This week has been pretty relaxed with having all of the ports in a row. I haven't worked tha tmany hours but tomorrow will be about 13 though. I have my elegant tea party, formal night and the midnight grand buffet where I have to give my speech. That speech I give is really long and I have to pronounce all of these french chef names. It's fun but I have to ask them to prounounce their names a hundred before I get up there.   Lots of love and wishes for a great Christmas.   Shell

      Okay, today has been boring. I haven't done one thing today. Everyone is offship today because we are in Acapulco. I came into the office this morning, worked for about an hour, went back to my room napped until 12. Then went to lunch with Lisa and then out to Villa Vera, Spa 7 Resort to lounge by the pool, drink lots of bottle water and continue to work on my tan.  (Which by the way I am turning bronze already! Step aside Jennifer Lopez.)  I got back about 4, then had a wonderful conversation with Jennfier - not Lopez.  Jennifer Odom.  We were on the phone forever but it was so good to speak to her and hear her voice. Afterwards, I came up to my office and I have been searching the internet since. I just changed as I am going out to dinner tonight at Carlos n Charlies in Acapulco. We don't leave from this port until 11 so we actually get to enjoy the nightlife a bit. Mostly everyone goes to Paradise but it's just like a crew bar there so Lisa and I decided to not go tonight. We are on our own adventure. Tomorrow works starts up again. Busy busy as usual. But tonight all the guests are calm and are quite possibly griping out some poor mexican at port about the cost of their taxi.  These people are so cheap I swear.  Man o man.   Ok, I am off for the evening. See ya soon. Shellbell.

      Sorry I didn't write yesterday but it was just a weird day for me. Friday night, I had my first starcode. STARCODES are pages on a select few beepers that run to the scene of a life or death situation. I am on that starcode team as I am the grief counselor for whoever is with the person who is dead, dying, or in process.  It's awful. Such an horible responsibility for someone to have - consoling someone who's family memeber (albeit huband, child, wife, et al) is not doing well. Friday night, my pager sas, "Starcode, Pavillion, Dck 7, Aft."  I threw everything down in my arms and just started running. It scared the hell out of me. Absolutely. I won't go into details but let's just say that it is only today that I feeling better. It felt like a scene out of ER.   Last night was formal and both of my officers had a wonderful dinner. My boss, told me before he sat - "Excellent." Which is a big compliment from him. I think he still questions my abilities since this is my first time on a ship. Apparently, it is really hard to get a job on a ship and they rarely hire new people.  So , it's taking all of us "first timers" time to gain the respect and confidence that everyone else already has - simply because it is our first time here.  anyway, last night went great.  I went to the disco for abit and then down to the crew bar with my friend Lisa.  My friend, the Safety Officer, he left today. Such a nice guy. I will miss him. It's so strange when you get to know people and they leave. Already 5 since I came aboard. But noone says bye, they say see you soon. Because this industry is so small you are bound to see these people again on a next contract.  OUr chief conceirge is leaving as well. She's really nice. From Portugal.   So, anyway, today we are in Acapulco. My favorite day. It's beautiful weather today. Most of my friends are all going to Wal-mart but I refuse. I want to go lay in the sun and just swim or go to a restaurant and eat some good food. (More seafood, hahah).  I am getting so tan! Already, you can tell I am in the Mexican Riviera every week.  Tomorrow Zihuatenejo. That's where the fat mermaid restaurant is. Yummy. I really need tot ake pictures of that place!  Okay, I will run for now. I hope everyone is having a lovely Sunday. I miss Sunday. Hell, I miss knowing what day of the week it is. Ok, who am I kidding here? I don't miss anything about it. It's wonderful to wake up everyday and wonder where I am in the world. I feel blessed.

      So Lisa and I went out to Crystal Resort again today. AIt was fun as usual and really happening when we arrived. Most of the people on the ship go to this resort so it gives everyone chance to hang out off the boat. When we arrived we jumped in the pool and swam up to the bar to order our favorite - pina coladas. We stretched out in the stone pools inside the pool and just sat there. We vegged and did nothing but soak up the sun and hang.  A few minutes after we got there Lisa saw the guy she is dating and his friend Pantelis. So the four of us hung out and played volleyball and drank. Well, most of the time it was the three of them hanging as I wanted to just lay out in the sun.  Nonetheless, it was fun and relaxing.  My friend E-tie came and hung outwith me for a bit. He is from Israel and we just sat there talking about what brought us to the ships, how long we were both here, etc. etc.   I got back to the boat about 4:00 and my mobile was already ringing when I walked in my room. Bother, work again. I am now back in the office. I got some sun so that was cool.   Tonight is ladies night in the crew bar and supposedly everyone is supposed to go because we all need to have a girls night. I personally don't feel like it after being out in the sun today. I want to finish what work I have, eat some food and check out a movie - wonder if that will happen. Hehehe.  More soon. Shelly

      Today we are in Puerto Vallarta. Lisa and I are going back to the crystal where we are planning to rent jetskis.  Not sure if will today since it's so beautiful outside. We may just lay out by the pool at the Crystal again. It's really warm out today.  About mid 80's and very sunny. Pretty weird to be two weeks from Christmas and in such a warm climate. I guess it's really cold in Texas about now. Most of the new people onboard are having season seaosn displacement. Just not really knowing what time of the year it is.   My friend Stephanie left the ship today. She got an email from Home Office yesterday that said she needed to attend a conference in Miami and from there she will head off for her vacation. I think she's planning on going home to Canada rather than traveling. She was pretty sad/excited to leave. Mixed emotions. I think I will feel the same. Especially since Lisa and I have become such good friends. I guess that's the way it goes though when you travel as much as people on ships do. I am sure we will all stay in touch though.   I am going to grab some food and head to the beach. I will write more about our afternoon escapades once I return.   Ciao,  Shelly

      Man, what a day. By far my best afternoon yet.   Lisa and I took off to Mazatlan today about 1pm. I finished my work as she did and then we hit the gangway. We took a trolley over to the port entrance and then headed to "El Cid," a major resort beach location in Mazatlan. We got to El Cid and went through entrance out the back way to find the pool and sun.   We walked down the beautiful coast to another hotel called Costa. We walked in and the pool attendant told us we had barely made happy hour. (Mind you, it was 2:00 at this time). We bought a bucket of Pacifico beer for $6.30 US. We sat by the pool laughed & gossiped about people on the ship, and entertained the thought of parasailing. I needed liquid courage and so we continued to drink our bucket of beer and soak in the sun.   After the bucket we decided to head down to go parasailing. OMG, it was incredible!!! Lisa went first because I was too chicken. I went to the little oyster stand (they were cracking them open right there on the beach!) and ordered a beer. The guy ran up to the top of the hotel and brought back a LITER of corona. It was huge. About that time, Lisa came down from parasailing and it was my turn.   WOW is all I can say. It was incredible. They strapped me in and told me that I could smoke and take my beer if I wanted. I declined, I was too scared. Lisa encouraged me to go so I strapped one leg in at a time and climbed in.  We took off. And suddenly I was about 50 hundred feet in the air. I could see the entire coastline of Mazatlan. The islands near by. I have never seen anything like it in my life. It was so quiet and calm. I stretched out my legs in the air and just marveled at the ocean far below. It was the most amazing experience. I had so much fun. It was a spiritual moment. I know it sounds corney but to be that high above ground in a foreign country when less than 2 months ago I was living on sixth working at some bullshit job, god, it was like I had arrived. Welcome to my new life of traveling and sailing. Literally.   I talked with Lisa after I landed and she felt the same way. It is also her first time away from home on her own adventures. It was just cool. So afterwards, we took our Coronas to our taxi - which by the way was an open golf cart that played disco music like YMCA, Disco Fever - we were cracking up. We arrived back at the ship and just got back into our office. It was such a kickass time. Freaking cool. It's times like these that make EVERYTHING feel right. I am where I should be.

      Yesterday.   I finished work at 8:30 and went to the Cova to have a glass of wine. The Chief Engineer joined and we were sitting laughing, joking about the formal night tables, etc. I received call from the Concerige department asking me to report immediately downstairs. I quickly ran downstairs before taking one sip of my wine.  I walked into Chief Conceirge's office and there were four of ym colleagues. A passenger's sister called to the ship to report that their mother had passed away. The man and wife were in their forties so I know it was a shock to them.  As part of my job, I have to tell these families of this news and help them make arrangments for their disembarkment at the next port.  When  the CC told me, I just sat there for a minute and took a deep breath then just reclaimed my composure and went straight to the dining hall. I had to leave the couple a note to call me immediately. I then walked to their room and told them the news. I think it was one of the hardest things I have ever had to tell someone.  But at the same time it was good that it happened and wasn't as bad as a major starcode for my first time.  I have to be the grief counselor for our guests when their is death in the family both onboard and onland. It's a part of my job that rarely comes in to play but last night reminded me of the reality thatit exists.  Today I had to get up super early to assist these people with their disembarkation. I have a meeting later in the morning and then I am going to the beach to just rest for the afternoon.  Kind of strange to be up so early as most of the time I don't come into my office until 8:30-9:00.  I am so spoiled.   Christmas is coming so soon! We have trees all over our ship now! Very exciting. I wonder if Santa will be stopping on our ship??  Shelly

      I love that song. Tracy Chapman completely rocks the casbah. Today we are in cabo and I woke up 10 this morning. It's a good day. Relaxed compared to the last 3. I am going to the beach with my girlfriends and we are going to soak up some sun and breath some fresh air.  It's so strange. You would think i would go out on deck more often but I just never do when I am on the ship.  For the most part I am sitting at my desk or in the dining hall visiting with guests. I had dinner with the penthouse guests last night during second seating. Formal wasn't so great last night but oh well. Right now we have a reunion cruise and almost all of our passenger are over 60. Tough crowd for sure. Sometimes I look at them and wonder what it will be like to be their age. Some of them are just the sweetest people I have ever met. Then you have the ones that should never come on a cruise because it's never going to make them happy. The miserable ones.   Thank you Jennifer for my CD. I love this CD.  Jen made me a cd before I left and it's just awesome. I listened to it almost every day but sometimes it just really kicks me in the head and makes me think about home. It's a nice retreat from the complaining guests, woman chatter behind my desk. I just put my headphones on and I am suddenly in a different world, my world, back at home.  I remember listening to this cd in Jen's car, the night before I left Austin.  We must have sat in her driveway for an hour just talking, laughing, crying, all the while listening to this cd.  Listen to me, I am going on and on about home. I do miss home. Time goes by pretty fast here though because I am so busy. I can hardly believe that I have already been here almost a month.  Unfortunately, I have discovered that a lot of people do not get to leave on their leave date.  More often than not their contract is extended. Maybe a month, a week, a day. But some people do 8 months when their contract was only 6.  And sometimes vacation is cut short.  That kind of sucks but I guess we will see.  I will keep everyone posted.  Merry Christmas, peeps. We just got our decorations in San Diego and so the ship sort of feels like a holiday. Not much though. Mail takes forever for me to get - apparently like a month or something. That sucks because I will be receiving christmas cards/gifts in January. But it's okay. I think the ship will have a special dinner for the crew. At least I hope so.  Okay, enough. I have to run and quit blabbering. Miss you all so much and I can't wait to see you.  I hopee everyone is doing well. You are all in my thoughts and prayers.   Shell

      Wow, I was so busy yesterday I didn't have time to blog. I turned in my time card last night and I had a total of 74.30 hours for the week. Isn't that insane? Yesterday was the busiest day. Today was the sane as I had three functions back to back. Tonight is formal night again and I get to wear my new dress! Exciting! I bought it at Macy's yesterday when i went out to port. (San Diego).    Things are going well as usual. We had a bunch of crew disembark yesterday. One girl from the Spa got fired because she was coming to work drunk everyday. (Like 9AM in the morning on one day).  Pretty sad stuff.  Another guy got kicked off because he tested positive for drugs. Not sure what kind though. I just pretend there aren't any better - the less I know the better. My friend Fotis invited me and Lisa to visit him in Greece over vacation. He has a big summer house there and he said he invites all his friends for two week to vacation there. Sounds like fun. He's such a nice guy. I don't know if I will go but it was very nice of him to offer.   Lisa is well again so finally I feel like I have my half back. She's so cool. We just laugh so much and since her desk is right near my office we talk to each other all day. It's funny, when we eat in the officer's mess, we are usually the two loudest people just rolling on the floor cracking up.  She's fun. Glad she didn't give me her norwalk yuckness.   I am over my sea sickness which is good. Tomorrow is CABO and finally a day to relax.  Lisa and I and a few other girls are taking over to the beach tomorrow to get some sun and play. It's the only time when we feel like we have a day off and most of the time we are still working in the evening once we come back onboard.    Must run. Get ready for formal night. Much love to my homies, mommies & my girl.

      Today I feel sea sick. I woke up this morning and wanted to puke.  We are travleing very fast to make San Diego on time as we were delayed in Zihuantenjo by 3 hours. So, the Captain has picked up the speed and now we are all green in the face. Just naseous as hell. I realized a bit ago that maybe so fresh air would make me feel better. I haven't been outside in 2 days. I stepped out and it was much better. Supposedly, my office is in the best part of the ship for motion but I think I disagree. I am sitting here at my desk rocking back and forth watching some of my things shift around.  It's weird. Not to mention my stomach is turning flips. I may go downstairs to my cabin shortly and try to nap for a bit. This motion sickness is for the birds. I ate some bread (apparently experienced crew know this) and will have a glass of ginger tea. I guess there are a thousand remedies on board. We will see soon.   Last night fun. The greeks are crazy on this ship. We all went to the officer's mess and sat there and listened to greek music. It was fun. I watched all the officers dance around like weirdos and I listened to more greek talk than I have all ship. I need to learn that language because I swear they are talking about me. (Of course, you know it's all about me...hahahah) Just kidding.  What else. Hmm. I don't know. I gotta work though. I need to puke. I keep thinking that will make me feel better. I fear that once I start, it will never. Sorry to have a blog entry about throwing up. Just thought I would share.   The weather is nice outside though. About 65 degrees, sunny and the ocean has huge swells today. Listen to me, I sound like a true maritimer.   smooches.

      Hey peeps - double blogging today as I just felt I needed to vent a little bit. Today has been one of the longest and most stressful of all. I have seated one table right now and I have one more left for 8:25. Then, on to rest for a bit. From there 11:30, I host the midnight buffet. I have to speak into the microphone for 45 minutes talking about the chefs and everyone. I am tired people. Really, really, really, really oh by the way -really tired. The sleep on board is nil to none. I slept last night 4 hours and have been going since 9 this morning. I change clothes 3 times throughout this day. (Formal evening). I am eager to get back to San Diego.  Even embarkation day is one of the busiest for me.   I just met 6 couples for the first time and had to introduce them all. Remembering their names and faces was very tough - especially since I have only their guest card pass to view. Anyway, we are getting a new captain for next cruise. I just heard some rumors around the ship today about the old captain. Apparently, he has a wife in Thailand but has a thing for phillipino stewards. Insteresting. Funny, how everyone knows things but doesn't talk about them very often. I must say this ship and ship life in general is worse than soap operas. These are the days of our lives. My god. So, you are seen talking to anyone and you are suddenly sleeping with them. Weird, huh? I have seen it happen to a lot of the new people already. Fortunately for me,  I am the social hostess so I talk to everyone and people know it's for my job.  Weird. Ship Life it's own entity for sure. Married people who have spouses at home are constantly developing relationships on board. Very strange to me as I think it's just completely wrong. All of the girls on board want so desparately to hook up with an officer on deck 10. Little do they know but most of them are gay. And the others are all yucky and old. The greeks think there are two different lives. One on board and one at home and that they are separate. I just don't think that's right at all. But nonetheless, I just go about my day, doing my job and hanging with my friends.   Anyway, whew.  I have an hour and half to kill so I think I will grab a cup of coffee. Lots of love. Talk to you soon.

      Hola Pacos. Como estas?   Three people in my area have been quarantineed for carrying the Norwalk Virus.  72 Hours of pure hell. Norwalk is a gastrointestinal virus that is easily transmitted through normal interaction like the common cold. Pretty yucky and my friend Lisa just got it. I was hanging out with her last night so today I have been very OCD about what I touch and come in contact with. I don't want that crap.   So, today is a Greek Holiday - Name Day for St. Nikolaos. Name day celebrations are much bigger in their culture that their own birthday. Tonight there is a huge party to celebrate with greek music and plates/glasses breaking. I will take pictures. Apparently, in previous celebrations, all the plates and glasses on board have to be locked up because the greeks break everything. Hahaha. Funny, huh? I am sure it will be a fun learning experience for me. I have been learning so much about their culture and traditions. Because 60% of the ship's employees are greek, all the holidays are observed.  Tradition and Family Names are the most important things to these people. Everyone adapts to their language - me now speaking basic communication words in Greek to officers. It's respectful to address the officers in the Greek language so through trial and error I am learning quite quickly.   In addition, I am learning some French (sorry, Richard), mixed in with Spanish.  My Spanish has improved a lot because I have to use it in port so much. So that's good. Sometimes when talking to my friends on board we will be using 3 different languages - bits and pieces. It's fun and very interesting.   Tonight is formal night - AGAIN. Busy evening for me but the good thing is things are getting easier day by day. I am learning a lot - brain overload. Hehehe. It doesn't feel Christmas on board. I will be sending my mail out on Monday so look for postcards from me. Lots of luv, Shelly.

      So last night, myself and 4 other girls went out to Paradise. Acapulco is our longest length of time in port (until 11pm).  So we went out to dinner at 8. It was awesome. We heard about this palce called paradise and so we decided to go their. First let me tell you that earlier in the day I went to Walmart. Walmart is my favorite place in port.  Uma and I went there to pick up panty hose and we ate in the McDonald's there. I had a McPechuga sandwich. Hahaha. It was a spicy chicken sandwich but the entire menu was in spanish. I don't know how but often I forget I am in a foreign country. Moments like these in McDonald's quickly remind me. Anyway, Paradise was beautiful.  The most tropical restaurant i have been too. it was in the plaza area of Acapulco. In th emiddle of the restaurant (which was all outside and open on the beach), there was this huge bungee jump station.  We order pina colodas and ate some wonderful food while watching crazy people take the plunge of death. It was crazy cool. We took a lot of pictures and as promised they will be coming soon - almost done with the roll!   LISA and KIM are my new friends. They are awesome. We all blend very well. Kim is from Holland and wants Lisa (Lizaki as the greeks nicked her) and I to visit while on vacation.  Lizaki and I are thinking of vacationing together a bit. She wants ot come to Texas so maybe you will get to meet here. Think Pam Anderson. That's what she looks like. Gorgeous girl but breaKing hearts all around the ship. This girl is freaKing cool as shit. All the canadian girls adopted me last night. I am now canadian. Hehehe.  I have to run.  If you have left me a voicemail, I will call once I am in San Diego on Monday. Love you bunches. Shelly

      Okay, you know that bumper sticker, "mean people suck" ??  I have propose a new one, "old people suck (sometimes)"  We have currently over 1,000 guests that are above the age of 55 and I swear some of these people are the crabbiest. I had two people in one of my group functions last night (in addition to non-english speaking japanese people), just pull out the bitchy card with me last night. I talked to the hotel manager and everything is fine now.  My bosses are so layed back. Just very cool. They say, "Bravo, my dear. You are doing great. Do not worry.  Finito."  Their language and culture is very charming, for sure.   Oh, so, for Paddy - On board this ship for this cruise is philadelphia phillies player with last name of THOME. His wife is drop dead gorgeous and apparently they are pretty famous.  Does anyone know who they are? I didn't know until last night when one of my table-mates told me.  Speaking of which, Yiannis (our assistant hotel manager) invited me to dine with the formal captain's table last night and so I sat with all of the people I chose. Just lovely people I picked. Somehow, I managed to pick out one man in the JAG (Attorney for the navy - yes, Richard, I know you are singing the theme song right now - "In the navy, In the navy."), and two other attorneys - one for criminals, another for real estate. I had a therapist for criminals, a marketing specialist and his debutante wife as well as a travel agent woman. It was great.  All of my invites praised me in front of the captains. We had lots of wine and made jokes, had the greatest dinner (new york sirloin! yes, I ate steak and I normally hate it. It was incredible!).  After dinner, I received roses for me and all of the guests.   I am learning new languages. Greek, French, & Spanish.  some many cultures collide here...  It's awesome.  Today, Uma and I are going to Wallmart to get a christmas tree, christmas cd's and stockings. We are putting stocking in our office so people can drop things by to us. Hahaha. It's going to be great having Christmas in Mexico. I miss my family and friends so much. and my Jennifer. But thankfully I have made some wonderful friends and they will keep me company so I don't jump off the ship. Hahaha. Oh forget about it - I would never. This life is too fun to write home about.    Lots of luv, Shelly

      Today was awesome. Very awesome. I had a meeting at 10 this morning but was out by 11ish.  I took the rest of the afternoon off since we were in Puerto Vallarta. I went to walmart, bought a DVD player for 35.00 (isn't that cheap??) and then went to THE CRYSTAL HOTEL with my canadian friends, Lisa & Kim.  We sat at this huge resort pool for like 3 hours drinking pina coladas and lounging in the pool. We played volley ball, swam, got lots of sun. It was so much fun.  This resort was crazy cool - it had huts all throughout the pool, swim up bars, chairs inside the pool, waterfalls and it was located on the beach.  We could see the mountains and the shore if we looked right. I mean the beach was right there!! It was so cool. We didn't realize we were getting tipsy until we started to leave and kept bumping into things. Those were the best pina coladas I have ever had. They came with the fruit and everything.  We sat there and pretended we were on vacation with all the rest. It was a great escape from the ship for sure.  Plus, I got to spend quality girl time with new friends. These girls are a riot. We came back to the ship at 4 and then I showered to come to my office for a few hours. But when I was sitting out at that pool, I just kept thinking, "I can't believe this is my job."  I am still in shock. I was sitting there going, "I am at a resort pool in Puerto Vallarta and a month ago I was sitting in a boring staff meeting under flourscent lights."  It just doesn't make sense. I keep waiting to wake up and this all be a dream. It's just too incredible. It doesn't seem conceivable.   Anyway, we took lots of pictures and everyone will be happy to know that I am getting close to the end of the roll. I will probably get them developed when we get back to San Diego in a few days. Then I will try to figure out how to post on this website. I am sure there is some way I can. - I just have to figure it out.   Tomorrow is a sea day so no ports and I will be very busy again. But Acapulco is on Thursday, yippee. I love traveling. It's the best feeling in the world to be somewhere new everyday.   Lots of hugs and kisses sent your way,  Shelly

      Is anyone tired of hearing how fabulous my life is?? Hahaha. I am getting kind of tired of writing about it. I wish you could post responses here. Too bad, I am cheap and jumped on the first free blogger site I found.   So today was good. Didn't have too much going on.  Last night I had dinner with my new friend, Uma. It was her, myself, the lead conceirge (Jackie), and another girl Stephanie. We had special arrangements in the formal dining hall. It was in the Palm Springs area of our ship and it was very formal.  We were celebrating Uma's birthday. It was really fun.  It's amazing how close you get to people in such a short period of time on board.  I mean you eat every meal with them, go for an afternoon cocktail when you have some downtime, talk about anything and everything. It's great. I really like Uma though. She's a Chinese Canadian girl who speaks fluent french and bits and pieces of about 14 languages. Pretty impressive! I am learning a lot about the greek language through interactions with our officers. Like, "Ella."  Ella can mean a thousand things depending on the context. It can mean, Come on you are pulling my leg.  Or Ellaaa, you are so stupid. Interesting language, greek is. And I pick up accents so easily.  Lately, I slip into some weird european twang when I am talking because I am around people with weird accents all the time. I remember when I went to New York for the first time. I came back after a week and a half talking like a staten island girl. It was awful. Hahaaha, I am so impressionable.   I had safety meetings today. I learned about my life raft.  We have a real setup with life rafts - they can fit 25 crew members and we have food, water, a knife, reflective devises, flashlights, smoke signals, flares, everything. It's really unbeleiveable how much stuff they put in those rafts.  So I was busy with that stuff today for quite a bit.  Then I came back to my office and picked out my tables for our next formal night (Wednesday).  I can't wait to go into Puerto Vallarta tomorrow. I am going to Wallmart (with 2 L's). Go shopping for a bit, eat some lunch and then back to work.  You know, I thought working 70 hours a week would be tough but honestly, it doesn't bother me. Especially since I can go upstairs and sit with Uma for 30 minutes, have a cocktail, shoot the shit and come back downstairs and work. I don't punch a time clock and no one is ever looking over my shoulder. It's just hey, have a good time if you are going to work so much. Pretty great work ethic. Too bad america couldn't adapt to this working lifestyle. I think Europeans experience some of the luxuries that we do on the ship. Afternoon breaks, et al. I know when I was working at ECI none of this would ever be conceivable.   Oh yeah, I had one of the entertainers come to me today. She is so adorable (about 19).  She came to me and said very shyly, "Do you think when you have some time that you might be able to tell me about your job.  I don't want to really work on ships anymore and I would love to get a job being an event planner." I was flattered. It was so sweet. I think I will meet her later tonight and give her some advice (whatever, that may be???) I don't even know how I got here. Hahahaha.  Take care and have a great Monday, whever you are.  Shell

      I am from Texas. Yes, I am from Texas. Houston. Austin. Texas. Texas.  I am ask the same question wherever  go albeit in Mexico in a Taxi, in Mexico in a store, on the Ship after ihave already told everyone - I am from Texas.  In Acapulco today, again. It was a gorgeous day and I went to villa vera until I got very rudely interrupted by all the dumb ditzy blonde dancers who I can't stand. These girls make ME, yes ME, want to puke.  Rumors have spread around the ship that they are carrying STDs like a plague and most all of them are sleeping with some greek officer. I can't stand them and now they are in my department.  Fortunately, I am in more of a supervisory role than them. I was a villa vera resort for 30 minutes before they ALL showed up with their greek boyfriends...prancing around in tiny bikini's screaming, "Aww, Don't - I am fat. I don't want everyone seeing how fat I am."  4 Words for these girls - EAT A PIZZA BITCH. Ugh, I was so irritated that I stayed for an additional 30 minutes and left when I had planned to stay all afternoon. It was disappointing, but oh well. I then took a taxi to the beach and decided I would try that option. I walked for about a 1/4 mile before I ran into some friends. I stopped and plooped into the sand. Watched the waves crash,ate some great garlic shrimp, and headed into the water.  While Iwas there, a huge tidal wave sucked me under, filled my entire swimsuit top and bottom both with sand and I think I had a rectum cleansing. I was spit out on the beach shore where I discovered that this tidal wave crashed into my handbag getting everything covered in water and sand. It was fiasco I swear. Nontheless, I was able to get some of the sand out and get in another taxi to come back to the ship. I am hoping to go out again tonight for dinner but I am scared to dath of what might go wrong this time. Hahaha. Aww, I am sure I will survive.  I have gotten a dark tan in the last few days. My hair is getting much blonder and I am happy to report that I have lost almost 15 pounds. Ship life is good. Very good. Hehehehe. I have many photos that I would love to share but I can't figure out how to post them on this site. I guess they will have to wait.   Many hugs and kisses and lots of hellos to all my friends at home. May 29th will not be here soon enough. Hi Paddy.

      good evening everyone. how is it going? things are great here as usual. just working very hard and playing very hard. we have a psycho woman stalke don board who keeps following our entertainment staff around telling them she will make them all stars and famous in GET THIS - Arizona!!! YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.  She's crazy.  She has even tracked one of the singers down in his cabin. How retarded.  Anyway, things are running smoothly. The last 2 weeks cruise the weather was bad. we had storms in all of our ports and rain as well. I enjoyed it to be honest as it had been almost 2 months since I had seen any.  I am very excited about getting into San Diego tomorrow. Two guests that have sailed with me preivously are meeting me at the terminal and we are going for lunch.  Just wonderful people - Kat & Ed.  Edis a photographer for Better Homes & Gardens and Kat is a pilot. She emailed me today and wanted to know if I could get away for a bit. I accepted certainly!  I am definitely settling into this ship life now. Starting to become even more familar with our 10/11 day cruises - just the way things go and schedule of events etc.  i had a conference call with our Miami office last week and they outlined quite a bit of changes for my position which i am very excited about. Right now I am spending about 5 hours a day in the office doing invitations, administrative work and because they want me out in th public all the time - they are giving me an assistant to handle my administrative work. I am super excited about this because it will allow me more opportunities to throw parties and host events with my guests. Yippee!  Let's see what else new - oh I got a raise. Pretty cool. Let's just say ECI can take that 3 1/2 percent and shove it - because after being here for less than 2 months, I have just received a raise times 5 of that percent. Jerkoffs. It's amazing to me how some companies can treat their employees like slaves. At least here, we want to be here and enjoy our job!   Well, I am off to the dining hall now. best to everyone. smooches!  shelly

      Last night, I had laundry wars. I went to deck 4 to the dreaded Laundry Room to wash some clothes. We have 3 working washing machines for 800 people. (You can imagine my delima). After waiing forever to use one, my machine kept breaking in the middle the cycle. The washing machine door was flying open and water was going everywhere. I called the chief electrician and he came. What a mess. I hate doing laundry on this ship. Next time, I think I will send all of my clothes down to the Chinese Laundry and have them do it for me again.   I watched Indecent Proposal last night.  I haven't seen that movie in ages. It was weird. Demi Moore is such a cat though - just a beautiful woman. Wow.   It's raining in Puerto Vallarta. Yesterday was the first time I had seen rain in almost 2 months. I loved it. I just sat in the rain and talked with friends.   Oh, man, got a call. Have to run - I will write more later today.

      Hey peeps, sorry it's been so long since I blogged. Gosh, a week, huh? Sorry, guys, it's been busy, of course I have made some friends on board as well and time just completely flies on this ship.  Let's see what's happened since my last blog - -   I got my next assignment and sign off date here. I sign off of this ship on May 29th and will head home for 2 months. Then back to the Century doing the eastern/western caribbean from July 28th until January-ish.  Our ship will be on a 7 day run but will do both sides of the caribbean every other week. Some of our ports include: Ochos Rios, St. Maartin, Bahamas, San Pedro - really nice caribbean ports. I am very excited. Mexico is, uh, well, getting a little boring. Fortunately, my curren ship is doing a repositioning in March and we will be leaving out of San Francisco going to Catalina Islands, Monterrey & Cabo again. Then May 1st we will be doing Alaska again. Not bad for one contract. I will be able to be on the Alaskan cruise probably a month and then I will head home.   We are all glad to have survived the holidays. On our christmas cruise we had over 450 children on board and I wanted to kill myself. Kids are such terrors, I swear. We had teenagers all over the ship and even one 18 year busted in our a room with 6 guys (I don't think I need to go into details at this point. I will let your imagination go on this one.)  The New Year's cruise was awesome though. All of our passengers had to be 21 and most all were younger in age, party people. The casinos were packed every night. The crew drank a lot last cruise -we were all a litle shocked when we got our bar bill last week. Whew!  Talk about some depressed people, do we even remember Christmas/New Years?? Hahaha.   Today, Lisa and I headed out to Cabo and rented Jetskis. We were out on the ocean for an hour just jumping waves, drinking tecate and basking in the sun. It was blast. We circled our ship, took photos of the islands and rock formations. It was really fun. We came back to the ship and have been blah since. We were planning to have a Shell sisters night but I don't know if we will make it. I am drinking coffee right now, trying to wake up. Tomorrow we are in Mazatlan which means - our surfing lessons day. We go to the beach there and hook up with this mexican guys who teach us how to surf. It's fun because they run the parasailing boats too so, we can do that if we want. It's kind of boring to do it a lot though. Hahaha. We will contineu to learn how to surf for a fewhours, drink some beers and come back to the ship.  Our usual.   We just got a new Assistant Hotel Manager (the 3rd since I arrive in November), a staff captain, safety officer, navigational officer- lots of new people on board. All the others have gone on vacation now. These guys are really tough.  The drummer on the ship got fired in San Diego. Apparently he sucked. I felt bad though because I had hung out with him a few times and I didnt get to say goodbye. Cool guy, just a crappy drummer I guess.  The tranzy has been given me drama mama. She's sooo crabby and I hate working with her.  Fortunately, my office is located in a different spot now and I don't have to deal with her quite as much. So moody, I swear. I think she's transfering ships soon though. Someone promoted her to group coordinator from guest relations officer - all of the girls in the office have our thoughts about how this happened....  Yeah, we are sailing no! The sky is beautiful right now. It's been sort of cloudy today in Cabo but the sunset is still gorgeous. I love the susnets/sunrises on board. You really feel the beginning and close of each day. The reflection of the sun and moon on the water is just indescribable.  I saw dolphins today while we were jetskiing. It was really cool - they were right next to my jetski. Lisa and I tried to get some photos but it was difficult as we were just learning how to drive those suckers.  Nontheless, it was cool.   What else....work is going good. Just staying busy and meeting tons of people. This week we have a well known writer on board from the San Diego Tribune and I am trying to spend as much time with her as possible. She's doing a write up on Celebrity and so I have been escorting her, introducing her to everyone. It's fun - she's a really nice woman.  I just found out that probably within the next few months my title could change to Public Relations Director.  It would be a salary increase and of course will look phoenominal on a resume for a land-based job. I am pretty siked - I hope they decide to go that route.   Okay, this blag has turned into a novel. I hope everyone is doing well. I am looking forward to a big bash when I get back to Austin. We will have to go out bar hopping after my solid 3 days of hibernation with Jennifer.  Lots of love your way,  Shelly

      Acapulco stinks.  I smelled the worst smell in my life today and I haven't a clue of what it was coming from. I still smell it and it is now hours later on the ship. Peewwww.  Lisa and I had a very strange day in Acapulco. Orginially, we started out to shop for new works shoes and have some pina colodas. We went to Sansborn's which is supposedly a department store. Uh, no. The sold souviners there and that's about it. Next, we walked down to the Mexican Wal-mart, except this wasn't Wal-mart, it was weird. There was a man dressed in a spiderman costume handing out flyers, loud intercom speaking in spanish about the specials and people galore. We went in to buy Shampoo (I know how exciting right?) and the guy actually had the nerve to stop us as we entered the store with our pina colodas. What a first! isa and I have trecked inside the Puerto vallarta mall with open 40's of corona beer and never had anyone say anything to us. It was apauling. So, needles t say, we quickly finished our drinks and entered the store.  Shortly after making our purchases we crossed the street to head to "Zapatorias" (shoe store). We chose about 6 different pairs of shoes that we wanted to try on - meanwhile I am struggling with my spanish skills to tell them what size we wanted and color. Every shoe we chose, they could not produce the correct size.   It was frustrating. So we let and continued our shopping. Somewhere along the way in search of our next pina coloda, we end up in old Acapulco, walking down stinky streets with very local people surrounding us. We were in cracktown I am sure of it. We walked fast and finally escaped back to the tourist side. Don't think we will make that jaunt again. We ate at some random restaurant that didn't understand what nachos were and the margaritas were serve din plastic champagne glasses (very strange). Our taxi back to el barco was $2.00 (even stranger as normaly it's about 10).  All in all, what a weird day.  Lisa and I are planning to go out for dinner tonight. I wonder what will happen this time???  We are talking about bungee jumping tonight at Paradise. How scary. I don't know if I can pull it off. My luck, the cord will break and I will be flung in to the ocean.  i will keep you posted of the outcome.  I talked to Jennifer today for a long time. She's doing well. I miss her so much. Had a little breakdown last night where I tried to purchase an ocean phone card with 200 pesos of Mexican money since the bank was closed.  When I couldn't reach her, I gave up and went to sleep. Our conversation today was great though. I can't wiat to see her and everyone else in May.   Smooches from el stinko,  Shelly

      Well, I survived and hopefully all of you have as well. The night was incredible, yet someone was missing. Jen. I missed her so much and wanted so badly for her to be by my side at midnight. It was tough breath to take at the end of the countdown. Really tough.   With that being said, I guess I should update you on some things that been going on around the ship....  First, I got my safety card taken away last cruise because one of the bridge cadets questioned me about how many life boats we have. Hell, I didn't know and after taking a short poll around the ship I have since learned that no one knows this information. If you answer the question wrong during boat drill, then the safety officer takes your card. It sucks. I have been so busy that i haven't found time to go get "re-quizzed" in the safety officer's office so i can only imagine what he will ask me when I finally do. It was actually kind fo comical at the time but now I am a little nervous. Greeks are so intimidating sometimes.   Let's see - yesterday, my office was relocated. I am now officially under the entertainment department. Originally I was reporting to the Hotel Manager now I have the coolest boss in the world. He's the cruise director. It's good for me to be in this department because it's gives me the opportunity for advancement. (i.e. assistant cruise director, cruise director, yadda yadi). So now, I am in this office with the assistant cruise director and the cruise directors office is connected off to the side. Let's just say this- my boss rocks. He doesn't care what I do or when I do it. When I try to talk to him about my plans for the day, he says, "I don't care."  He's hilarious. We laugh so much already. His fiance is on board and she's pretty nice as well. And he is NOT greek. Which is good because I am a little over them today.   Last night was really nice. I went to th eopen deck to countdown with all of my friends. I can't wait to have my pictures developed. I have pictures of me and the Captain and all of the bridge officers. Also with Lisa and everyone else. I hope they all turned out well. After the countdown a guest and lisa and I went to the disco to have a few drinks (as if we needed them at this point). We arrived and I saw the Captain. He insisted that we sit with him and so we did. He had a bottle of dom perignon chilling on ice and suddenly when we sat, all of the waiters come over and start pouring our champagne, offering us canapes, etc. It was crazy. We sat there and drank and laughed for at least an hour. I was over it a bit because the Captain drains me sometimes. He's awesome but I have to be so prim and proper when I am in his company and it gets tiring. Especially when you have been in a formal since 4pm and you just want to put on your jeans and flip flops and drink a beer. I am sure all of you can sympathesize. Anyway, we sat there for a bit and then I excused myself and headed to my room to do just that. Change clothes and go to Deck 4 for our private crew party. (The time by now was about 2:30AM). Got to the crew party, hung out with everyone. The floor was very slippery so everyone keep sliding around, busting their ass every 5 minutes. I am proud to say I was one of those people. Hahaha. And then Lisa fell as well. It was hilarious. We would fall, everyone would help each other and then continue dancing. Hahaha. Lisa and I hung out there with all the greeks and everyone else until about 4:00pm. Then about 15 of us went down to the chinese laundry department and had a private party in the ac workshop. We broke plates. Drank vodka. Listen to greek music. The usual. Hahaha. And then Lisa and I left aobut 5:30. A long night for sure. I am tired and hungover like a mad dog today. But at least I survived. I came into the office about 9AM and stayed about an hour then went back to my cabin and slept for 3 hours. Everyone feels like hell today. All of the staff eyes are bloodshot, everyone yawning and just looking like hell. It's pretty funny. My boss came into his office in tennis shoes and shorts.   I think i will go back to my cabin now and take a little rest again. Hahaha. Everyone else is sleeping since we are in port today. (Mazatlan). GOne with the Wind is on TNT today! Yippee!! I started watching it this morning. i am sure it's still on now. Hahaha.   Wishing all of you the best of 2004. I love you all and miss you dearly.  Shelly

      I hada great day today, even though I am pretty exhausted by this point. I was able to talk to Jennifer today for about 2 hours  -it was great catching up. I was also able to call AJ, Stretch and my mother for awhile as well. It's always great  to hear familar voices on the other end of the telephone line.  Okay, I have 8 miutes before I have to head to the Captain's office.  Just got off the phone with him. The greek's answer their phone with a "nayyy" word which means, "Yes?" Kinda rude if you ask me but I just go with the flow.  My conversation is always the same with the Captain but we have this routiene and if I broke it the conversation wouldn't be right.  "Good evening Captain, this is your social hostess, Shelly."   "Ella, Shelly." "Yes, Sir, I have your tables ready for review." "Endaxi, 6:30pm" "Okay, bye." CLICK.  Everytime, the same conversation. It's funny. We have a lot of younger people on board this cruise. That's exciting - rather than same 70 years plus.  No offense to our elders but jeez, remind me not to be so cranky when I get older.   There was beautiful sunset out of San Diego tonight. It was - yes - cold in San Diego. The temp was about 58-60 degrees. (Much different from Acapulco a few days ago). None the less, the change in temperature was welcomed since we have been in 80-90's for the past 8 days. I can't iamgine what Alaska will be like.   Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.    99 days to go. Cali Nickta.  (Good night)

      Today is Thursday, and I just had to look at my calendar to find that out. It's so weird not knowing what day of the week it is.   So, I was thinking last night after a long conversation with Jennifer, that it would be awesome to get everyone together for a weekend in Gruene for toobing down the river. I need to find that website with all of the information but ifwe book in advance we can get good rates and availability. There are little cabanas thatyou can rent for like $25.00 a night (so cheap) right on the guadalupe river. You can have camp fires and showers and anything really that you want. I will get my mother to forward me the link so i can post it here if anyone's interested. I was thinking maybe one weekend late June, early July. (Of course we still have plenty of time to discuss).  Things are going well here. Moral is a little low because we are all sooooo sick of the Mexican Riviera. I have no desire to have Mexican Food again in my life or for that matter drink a corona or pina colada. We changed course in about one month - March 12th - we have what's called a "dead head" cruise. This means we have no passengers on boad for 24 hours. We will be sailing from San Diego to San Francisco.  It should be a lot of fun - of course - only if we get a ew staff captain. The one we have right now is a mini Hitler. He gives warning for anything and you can imagine how hard it is for this Texas girl. I swear Texans are just our own breed of people. So friendly, low key - everyone else seems to just spaz about the smallest things.  Take for example - our security onboard - They are all from Israel. Apparently, they have to go through extensive training in the Israeli army to even be considered for a position onboard a ship. They have to be in the top of their class. So, just knowing that bit of information you can imagine how strict they are about the rules onboard. Then throw on top of that the evil dictator onboard and it's just ughhh.    Meanwhile, I have approximately 100 days left onboard the Mercury. And I am counting.   Today is a busy day. all the guests are complaining about their bills, organizing their luggage and just andering around the ship running into walls. Quite funny though - it's amazing to see how stable the employee have become when we have rough weather. By the way, when I refer to "rough weather" i am not speaking in terms of rain, snow, hurricanes - I am spekaing of the swells in the ocean.  The sea can become very rough at times and when it does our ship stabilizers are actually working extra hard ot keep the motion at a minimum. Today it has been pretty rough in that doors swing back and forth, things on our desks slide around and even funnier - our guests actually run into walls and each other. The crew has learned how to workin these conditions because we are here all the time. But the guests, oh it's funny - people walk in zig zags. Hehehehe.   I have talked to people who have been working on ships for 30 years and heard stories of ships almost turning over, 90 foot waves crashing down on the 14th deck - pretty scary stuff. it's hard to imagine when they are telling me these stories because it's just something I have never seen. The scary thing i I ill be in mid-Hurricane season on my next contract - and in a very dangerous area of Florida. Whew. I need to think about this a little more.  Anyway, I am blabbing but I hope everyone is doing well. I hear the weather there has been very cold and evensome snow recently!?!?!? What's this crap baout? It never snows and when I leave we finally get some>>>>  Go figure.  It's been hot as hell in Acapulco - oh crap - speaking of which I want to tell you about the tsunami that attacked me at Sunset beach.....  My friends - Dave (the art auctioneire), Karen (his girlfriend), and Jason (the entertainer) and myself all decided to actually do something positive and educational in Acapulco for a change since all we ever do is sit aorund somewhere and drink. We hired a driver for about 4 hours and went on a tour. We saw the cliff divers - and if you have neverseen something like this, I highly recommendyou visit Acapulco.  There were about 5 guys who climbed (bare footed, with no safety ropes or anything) up a 100 foot cliff and dived straight into the ocean. It was the most incredible thing I have seen. I can't imagine taking a jump like that. (Apparently they are paid pretty well and are treated famously in Acapulco).  Ou next destination was the hotel Flamingo that John Wayne built. It was very quaint and the view was incredible. I was surprised that the overnight rates were so low - you can rent the honeymoon suite for about $75.00 per night and the balcony opens up to the ocean, there is a jacuzzi and a hammock right outside the door. It was really nice. John Wayne's private cabana was nice as well with a private access walk to the beach view. The cabana was shape din a circle with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. Very nice and all that can be yours for about $250 a night. (The most expensive on the property).   Now, to the tsunami part - we went to the lagoon and sunset beach in Acapulco shortly after. Had some lunch on the beach at this restaurant and then decided to go horseback riding on the beach. First of all 3 of 4 horses quite possibly could have been donkeys. But nontheless, we hopped on and wentup and down the beach.  It was great. Karen and I decided to take a swim in the ocean afterwards so we went trotting off to the sea. We jumped in and started swimming out a bit. 2 minutes after we are out there, I look over my shoulder and see a SIX - yes SIX - FOOT wave coming directly towards us. I looked at her and screamed, "SWIM!!!!!" And she dove under the wave and survived. Me, I couldn't get under quick enough so I was sucked up by the current and thrown against the bottom of the ocean floor. It was death moment for me. I realy thought I wasn't going to come up. There was so much water and I came up gasping for air. I was practically running on the water to get out before the next one struck. Very scary!! All in all no broken bones or anythin - just some major whiplash and a black eye. (My hand hit me in the face when I was thrushed down.) So, I don't think I am going to swim in  the ocean anymore. Hehehe. No more for me.  Damn, I guess I had a lot to talk about. Sorry for rambling. I miss everyone so much and can't wait to get home and irritate the hell out of all of you.   Lots of love, Shell

      my woman is incredible. for those of you who haven't met her, you will, because she's not going anywhere. i received this huge bag of all of my favorite candy last night and taped to each piece of candy was a typed mmory of a moment that the two of us have shared.  it was the most incredible valentine's day present i have ever received. just so very thoughtful.    Jen, you are incredible. really incredible. thank you so much. i love you.  I am feeling much better today. Tuesday sucked but it's over.  Right now we ar ein mazatlan and I am bored because all of my friends onboard are being lame and no one wants to get off the ship. So, I am just bored. I haven't even eaten lunch yet. I just got back from my cabin - I ate a package f sour candies that Jen sent me. Yummy! But I think I need some actual food though. I am pretty tired today as I had a late dinner with the penthouse guests and a very famous artist andher husband on board.  Manuel and I hosted the Captain's Club party and we were sitting with the last guests when they realized they had missed dinner. So, I called the chief housekeeper and had their butler bring a menu to the guests in the nightclub so they could order and have formal dining in their penthouse. He came, took the order and we went back to their penthouse and had some cocktails (additional cocktails). We sat there and drank and ate and had such good conversation. It was the greatest evening. I am tired though this morning. Whew! I didn't get back to my cabin until after 2:00AM.   Anyway, things have slowed down a lot for me lately since I don't have the groups anymore. It's awesome, I actually have some free time now. I am not printing any of m invitations anymore, just chilling back having dinners in penthouses, living it up. pretty fun now.   hope all is well. miss everyone. love you. happy v-day.

      Do you ever have those days where you feel like you are in high school?  Let me explain.  I live and work on a floating high school.  Most all of the kids here are juniors, some seniors.  They all like to drink too much when they know they shouldn't and always jump at the opportunity to get naked with someone. They sneak alcohol into their cabins, throw dishes in the trash and smoke cigarettes in their offices. Some "forget" to wear their name tags on formal nights, while others throw parties on the bridge for the popular kids while the master is sleeping. Yet we still have those chosen few, the dedicated seniors that are solely looking towards their future and wouldn't do anything to jeopardize their career. (Mind you they are few and far in between).  Then we have the shoppies, (chicks that work in the gift shops), that pee in the coridors when the crew bathrooms aren't working, one actually lives with a married officer in his cabin, another one is gay and he sleeps with the photo guy who isn't "gay", oh and let me not forget the newest information I have found out - - one of the shoppies - offerec a private strip show about 4 months ago for the senior officers in a closed in area of the ship. I saw the photos 2 days ago, believe it or not.   And that is just half of deck seven - move to another deck aft or forward....Let your imagination carry you.   This high school is located in a very small town, where everyone knows everyone's business and even if they don't know they will actually make up crap about you. Just make it up - completely untrue.  I know this because tonight one of the shoppies dared to ask me about rumors they heard about me, now labeling me with raised eyebrows as "the girl from Texas."  I kindly said to that shoppie as if I was Courtney Love, "Believe everything you hear"  and then flicked him off.  In this high school, we have separate cafeterias, much like separate lunch periods (A,B,C if you remember correctly). Except each messroom is like a different grade level.  The dancers are by far the freshman - err, freshwomen of the group and they are not allowed to eat in the seniors mess. I eat in the seniors mess but depending on the time of day, I may not go because of the looks women get when they walk in. It's like the popular kid walking into a room and everyone looks up from their plate to see what she's wearing and what she's eating.  All the while, whispering under the breath as she walks past. The Jocks in one corner and the nerds in another, the princesses with princesses, the new "age" with other new "age" - and then there's the cafeteria food. The lunch lady has changed her appearance from that we are used too - now she's a he and he's from Indonesia, he cleans the room and serves the slop. But unlike the junk food counters in high school, you can order from the fast food place and the indonesian will bring it to you.   Aside from this we have our physical fitness areas, those include the staff bar and crew bar - much different from the taebo tapes we watched in health class. Now, our health class is held in the medical center when a dancer gives  another  STD to someone on board.  We have the troubled youth counselor who is very popular for handling disturbances at home.  She usually talks to the principal about those problems he has with others and continually reminds him that shouting at his coworkers (i.e. students) is not in the SQM (School Handbook).    Then cut to the socal hostess, who apparently had a reputation before she even got here.  She's the bubbly one around the ship who is always happy yet recently she has been boggled down with too much of the high school life. Her normal happy self has turned to a frown and she scowls at everyone she comes in contact with -especially the crew. With guests, she is still managing to put the "act" on but in silence in her hidden office she sits typing about her drama on a computer screen. Everyone has noticed that she isn't quite the same as the first few months she was here.  Now, exuding much more negativity about the way things are handled and views things with a jaded tired look. There are moments when she shines. There are moments when she truly shines, one of those being when she hears the Cinderella gasps as she walks down the grand staircase with the most beautiful people on he ship walking behind her and a senior officer following.  But usually that moment lasts only from the time she enters the dining until the time she leaves (4-6 minutes).  She's mean to those around her, demanding of their attention only to throw it away in a whim, sincerity blinded by jealousness....jealousness of the people leaving in 11 days - back to their home and "normal" life.  Jealous of the families they have and the bonds they have created while on vacation. She has guests email her - "No, please stay in touch, " as she waves goodbye from the gangway.  All the while knowing that after a few emails the connection will fade and the guest's reality will set back in - she won't hear from them then...at least not until their next cruise, when they want VIP treatment -  to be invited to sit at THE table.  The Social Hostess sluffs it back and forth one side of the ship to the next only to be greeted haphazardly in the hall with either a feeble sounding voice of "good evening, dear" or a blank stare because the guest doesn't know English.  It is a constant battle this one fights daily - get up, get out of bed, laugh, joke, make fun of people, have a few cocktails, lay in bed, miss your family, plan your vacation and fall asleep watching the same movie you've seen a hundred times since joining the vessel. Oh wait, tonight's tomb raider two and she hasn't seen the ending of this one - only the beginning a few times.    Ugh, sorry just venting. Been a tough day. I need sleep. I was awakened at 3:45am this morning to the sound of the hotel director telling me that they needed me for a medical evacuation.  I jumped out of bed threw my hair in a ponty tail and got dressed in my uniform. I arrived in the medical center at 4:02am.  The coast guard arrived to the aft of deck 11 at 6:10am. I sat with guest, helped them pack, consoled the grown man as he weft over his father's condition. Then I watched as we discovered that the son would be able to accompany his dad in the life flight carrier. He was around 35-38 years of age. The son took one look at the helicopter flying above and the raft he would be placed in and said, "No, I can't go. I am too scared."  Then our medical team took this eldery man's body and placed him in the basinett and hoisted him high above the ocean into the helicopter. Shortly after the coast guard officer jumped up to catch the roped and they were off.   We will arrive in Cabo 3 hours late tomorrow because we had to turn the ship around to meet the helicopter. It was exhillarating and scary. I got back to my cabin at 7:30 this morning and smoked four cigarettes in a row. I thought to myself, "How could I ever leave a member of my family when they were in serious condition?" My fear would never be as strong as my will and desire to see them through the condition. I don't know. I just sat there.  Watched some travel show on Istanbul for about an hour and then went back to sleep. I got up at 10 and headed to the office. Exhausted and you know, it's now - let's see - 10:30PM and I haven't stopped since 10:00AM. The funny thing is I still have to make an appearance at 3 other places before finally going to sleep around 1:00AMish. What does that make? about a 22:00 hour day? Something along those lines.   I miss everyone. I miss the normality and politics of bullshit office. But you know, I also lie when I say that. I am just in a complaining mood and decided to spill my guts on this damn blog. Don't anyone dare take pitty on me - I am a princess in a dream world that suddenly has realized everything isn't always what it seems.  I am fine just needed to vent a bit. I get frustrated as everyone does at some point. It probably has a lot to do with the lack of sleep, the deepest of emotions from last night's medical and the argument I got into with Jennifer yesterday. I have just been in a funk this cruise. I need to pull out of it, swallow some prozac and hop back on the "happy-I-am-on-a-cruise-ship" train.   Oh poopy. I have probably just depressed everyone. Maybe not. Love you all. Next blog will be happy I swear.   Shelly

      Hi everyone. I am so sorry I have been slacking on my writing in the journal.  The internet sucks on the ship - it's so slow and lately I have had no patience for it.   Things are still going great out here at sea. Mexico is getting alittle boring to be honest but only because we are here every week. I am looking forward to mid-March when we switch to 7 day cruises traveling to Cabo, Monterrey & Catalina islands.  Should be a great cruise itinerary for awhile. And then of course we will head to Alaska before I come home.  It's so hard to believe I have been here almost 3 months. The time has flown by although now things have slowed considerably.   I have found this life to be somewhat lonely at times. Especially since my friend Lisa has dicked out a bit - she's hanging with her boyfriend all the time and I really can't stand him very much so we have just kind of broken up. Hehehe. I rarely even go to dinner with her anymore. But her boyfriend leaves in a couple of weeks so I am sure she will want to start hanging out again - I hate being a convenient friend. So, I think I will just blow her off for awhile after he leaves. She can find her own friends.  I have been hanging with a lotof different people but still some of the same. Fotis is awesome. I went to the crew bar and had a few drinks with him last night. I actually hooked him up with a guest over new year's cruise and he's madly in love with her. I think they are actually going to get married - definitel a sign that love at first sight still exists. I am very happy for him. Saddened though as he will be leaving me soon - going on vacation and then of course he will come back to the Mercury after I am on vacation.  I will then be on the Century ship so I don't know -hopefully our paths will cross again at some point.   The new group coordinator came onboard- which is excellent for me. I will no longer be in charge of groups which I am very happy about. These people can be so demanding and I already have enough on my plate as is.  The new group coordinator is Uma - remember me talking about her when I first came on???  She's turned into kind of a biatch and so now she has been nicknamed on the ship as, "Viet-Cong."  Kind of funny. I just try to stay out of her way and say as little as possible to her. I hate crabby people. They suck.   Today was a great day.  I hung out with some guests all day and they showed me an excellent time. We went to this place called Mayan Palace and had lunch, some pina colodas and exchanged great conversation.  The husband, Mr. Peterson, is a pilot for Northwest airlines. He's flying the 747's and his wife a beautiful socialite. Just great people in general. I am thinking about going out tonight but still kind of weighing it out. I don't have anything to do in the office so I am just kind of hanging out looking like I am working. (What's new with that??)  Our chief conceirge is leaving soon - in fact in a few days. He's a great guy, I will miss him. But I will see him again on the Century. He's headed there now. Strange how we are all connected in some way.   I have sort of decided to just chill in Austin/houston for my vacation. Jen and I have been tlaking about taking a vacation somewhere chilly. Just for a rest and relaxation break. I told her I just want to go to some random cabin in Utah or Kansas and just be away from all people. After being surrounded by 3,000 people for six months, the last thing I want to do is go to some tourist area on my vacation. Heheehe, for real.   I found a kick ass surfing spot in Acapulco.  Recolverado Beach. Supposedly excellent waves and good surf.  I am going with art auctioneire and asistant next time we are in Acapulco.  I am sure it will be fun. I was planning to go today but I hung out with guests instead.   Well, i am off the line now. Gonna go change into my austin jeans and tshirt with flipflops. Damn, I miss wearing those clothes. These uniforms are choking me. Hehehe. Love you all so much and I hope everyone is doing well. I miss you like crazy and can't wait to get home for 2 months to visit with everyone.   Much love to my ECI alumni.....

      Ella, peeps! How are you?   The last few days have been great. Just hangin out with friends and watching the time pass by. Our dead head cruise was awesome. We had soooo much fun.  Our day started at noon with a huge barbque, loud music and  heinekens.  Lisa, Kim, Gina and I decided to have a few beers midafternoon before going to our spa appointments. I spent 3 hours in the spa getting ionthermie (a shock-the-fat treatment), scalp massage and a manicure. It was wonderful. I had a little rob on and walked around like royalty. About 15 of us met in the disco to decorate for the party. I was in charge of decorations and let me just tell you - that disco was to die for. It was gorgeous. Balloons everywhere - we called it the Mercury Prom. Hahahah. After decorating we were all a little tipsy since we had a 12 pack of heinikens, we played bingo for cash and then headed back for the party about 11:30.  My friend Helen from Scotland went with Lisa and I and we dressed up like Charlie's Angels. It was so fun!! We took a lot of photos and got totally pissed. Next day we were in San Fran.   San Fran is beautiful. I want to live there. Our ship docked right next to Alcatraz and we actually sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge. It was incredible. I didn't get to spend too much time at the port though because I was working in the temrinal greeting our VIP guests. I did get out for an hour and fell in love with the city immediately. I can't wait to spend more time there.   We had our Welcome Aboard show on Saturday night and I completely screwed up. I have to introduce myself on stage and I just went blank in th emiddle of my speech - in front of 500 guests. I fumbled a bit before croaking out, "Many days we have. I look forward ot hanging out with ya."  It was ridiculous. I wanted to cry but I made it through it.   Last night the girls and I went out for formal night.  We drank wayyyy to much. We had 3 ooozo shots.  This is th emost insane liquor ever!!! Lisa bought a bottle of champagne and carried it from the disco to her cabin at the end of the night. (We aren't sppose to A-drink in excess, B-carry liquor around the public areas, C-take it to our cabin or D-kiss a guest in the process....Lisa did all of these things.  I woke up this morning in my formal gown with half a glass of champagne next to my bed. This party queen was out! We had sooo much fun though. Oh, it was a blast.  Meanwhile we all feel like hell today.  I have to run now though - I have to go host the fruit and vegetable carving now. Ewwww......  I am going to barf.  LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH.  CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU VERY SOON! MAY 29TH IS APPROACHING!!!!!

      Hi guys...sorry it's been so long since I had an entry. Been busy, distracted, lazy - a combination of it all, I suppose. Today is the very last time we will be in Acapulco. Sad day for us all as this is our favorite port. We leave tonight at 11:00pm.  I am frantically preparing for our disco party on the 12th. The crew has the ship overnight by ourselves as we are repositioning to start sailing out of San Fran. So when we leave San Diego on the 12th we will be alone - without any passengers. It will be great. But I am in charge of the decorations of the Mardi Gras theme so I have to go out and purchase all the decorations today. Can we say, "Donde esta la fiesta??"  Things have been going smoothly here onboard. I have 10 weeks left before I come home. I am so excited. I have had an awesome cruise this run. I met 2 young people from Austin who are so sweet. They are in their early forties I think. Just great people though - live right by Mount Bonnell and we had spent a lot of time together this cruise. It was great to talk to someone about home and have them know exactly where I am talking about.  I am planning to have dinner with them when I come by for vacation.   I have also met a couple of crazy ladies in their 30's that are from San Francisco. They are both therapists and just really laid back.  We spent the day together in Puerto Vallarta and just had an awesome time. (Yeah, I spent the day with not one but two, therapists.  Go figure.)  They have invited me to San Fran to stay with them and go tour the city. I think it would be a lot of fun for sure.  Just don't know when I will have the time. Hehehehe.   Nothing really new here.  Just hanging out.  Got the fleet ratings yesterday from last cruise and I am the highest rated social hostess in the entire fleet.  I was so excited. I can't believe it!! It feels great to be at the top. (Of course everything could change in one cruise).   Let's see, what else.... the food sucks here, my skin is so dry from the treated water and air conditioning system.... I can't wait to come home and eat some great food. Nothing has a taste here. Hmmmm...... Brick Oven. Brick Oven sounds so good right now. Or Z-Tejas.   Next week - we will be doing Cabo San Lucas, Monterrey & Catalina Islands. All 3 are tender ports which will make it difficult for us to get off the ship. May 5th - adios! Headed to Alaska! (Super excited about those itineraries....)  Okay, I am a blabber, blabbering all over this screen. Love everyone and miss you dearly!

      Just left Mazatlan.  The town can be described easily as one of Mexico's armpits.  (I am convinced Mexico has more than the standard two.) I spent the day out today by myself. I hopped into an open air taxi and cruised over to the beach resort, El Cid. I hung out and had lunch by myself, watched the ocean, thought about coming home and went to the pool. I listened to the entire cd of Shakira - apparently Mexicans think she should be played everywhere - they must be trying to reclaim her after this american stint. I got tons of sun in the short 3 hours I was out.  It was really nic eot be back in Mexico.  I am really really really looking forward to being in Puerto Vallarta tomorrow. We have this huge flaming gay group on called "The Pied Pipers"  and they are taking me to some gay resort in Puerto Valarta tomorrow.  It's called Blue Chairs or something?? I am going to do some research on the internet and see if I can get an idea before I go.  The last thing I want to do is parade around Mexico with a heard of naked "Gay and Away" travelers. Hehehe.  Nonetheless, Lisa and I areplanning to head to our own territory in the afternoon, "The Crystal" hotel and resort for some last minute memories before she leaves on the 5th.  I can't wait to have on of those pina coladas again.  Didn't I write earlier that I never wanted one of those again?? Hahaha.  well, nothing too new here folks.  Still on the ocean. Water is still blue and I still miss all of you. (Oh look, Jen, I made a poem - hehe).   see you in 29 days. remember when I had the 108 day count down??? we are getting closer here!  luv, shell.

      I will be free. Free to roam whatever part of the world in whatever clothing I chose to wear. No more nude nylons, no more black high heels or kacki brown skirts...  No more blue blazer that's 2 sizes to big and no more make-up twice a day.  I will put on my white t-shirt, jeans and flip flops and walk off of this floating city.  Grab a beer in the San Fran airport, say goodbye to my friend Kim who will be heading back to Holland, my friend Dwayne who'll be returning to the UK- and then bam!  I will be home. Arriving shortly in the airport to the beautiful smile of my mother.  I can't wait.   I filled out my resignation form today (they make you do thias every contract). I dropped it by our crew pursers office and smiled. 4 weeks to go. only 5 days left in this cruise and then I ma off to Alaska.    I will miss many people here - like Helen from Scotland, Adam from Colorado/Utah, Tineke from New Zealand, my cabin attendant - Terrance from India, Nils from Germany, Kim from Holland, Bisser from - wait I don't know where he's from??? I hope to see them again some day........ BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HOME DAMN IT!!!!!  I can't wait to kiss everyone's faces and show all my photos and talk for hours about the lessons I have learned. The lessons you have learned, yaddi yadda yadi.  I can't wait to see Lisa Letchworth, Paddy Langford, AJ!!! It feels like an enternity since I was free. ree to take off my watch and not worry about the next cocktail party I must attend, or the next formal night when I have to put on a party gown again.  Oh, I can't wait. Mom has planned a nice toobing trip for me and Jenn and family for July 4th! We will rent a cabin and stay the weekend! That will be very nice.   So we finish this week with our final --- final --- final trpis to Mexico.  Tomorrow we will be in Mazatlan, Saturday in Puerto Vallarta and Sunday in Cabo.  2 Sea Days and then back in San Fran - then 1 day until I am in Vancouver!! Yippee!  I am so excited to see another part of the West Coast! And then Alaska as well. Don't worry I will tak eplenty of photos!  Alright, I have the Captain's Cocktail Party now so I must head there (we call it Captain's _ _ _ _ - I will leave those blank for now...hehehe). See everyone very very very soon!  30 days and counting!  Love, Shellaki.

      and you didn't answer. I wanted to hear you breathe and I wanted to tell you that I quit.  I quit these rambling moments for you - I quit. I layed there and wondered what you might be doing at that very moment, 5:02AM. West Coast Time. An opifany. A moment when time stopped but never began.   Last night I would have walked the plank to be in your arms. Cut out my own heart to hear your voice.   I called for you last night and you didn't answer. I don't even know if anyone answered - I just know that whoever, whatever - it wasn't you.    I was prepared to tell you everything about me last night. Tell you everything about our future and our past. Tell you that I couldn't stand one moment in my future without you.   Today I fumble my words because I still want to curl up into a tiny ball and cry until I see you. I am sorry for being the loser jerk ass girlfriend who doesn't realize what she has. Futhermore, I am sorry that no one I know can understand the passion and love I feel for you. And the passion and love that you give to me....how sweet our moments are. Baby, for you there is no one comparable and I can't wait to rush to you - run to you -   Lost in the middle but found on the way home.   I don't know how to leave you again.   I love you.

      Okay, I am not an official loser.  I have watched dirty dancing 5 times since he came onboard.  LOSER!  Last night we had our "Circle of Excellence" awards for the staff and 10 employees were given awards. Shortly thereafter we had a party and all the stars showed up for it. It was fun - nice treat for the crew.  I was hosting them around the party though so I was pretty much working (but, yeah, what a deal though). No worries. Anyway, tonight THE group as they have become to be called, is hosting a private kareoke session and I have been invited! I told Shaft (Richard Roundtree) that I want to sing "I've had the time of my life" with him. Heheheh. I will let you  know the turnout. Hahahah. How funny though right? Me singing a dirty dancing song in front of Patrick Swayze. Hahahahahahahha.  Anyway, I miss my family and friends in Austin like crazy. I started packing some things today and will send a box home of stuff to Mom next week. May 29th will be here sooooo soon!!! Love you all dearly. Hi Paddy.   Shelly.

      Elaine - you remember right? From Seinfeld??? Her boss from the tv show is also onboard this cruise. These people are making me crazy though.  I was dealing with Mr. Dirty Dancing until midnight last night, examining the funk-shey (yes, I am spelling it this way) of his room with his wife. Crazies. Then I pass by our lounge and the whole group of movie stars etc are sitting there laughing drinking a $950 bottle of brandy and throwing money at me.  The penthouse suites who will remain nameless right now, threw $200 bucks into my pocket for simply helping them with everything.  I can't beleive this crap?!?!?!?! They have been here only 12 hours and suddenly there bill is already over a grand. Anyway, having formal tonight which I am excited about. I given Dirty Dancing a bodyguard - my friend Adam who works as sports coordinator. he's beefy and can take of the 12 year old mania. hahahah.

      Okay, no lie, The Dirty Dancing king arrived this afternoon in San Francisco and is sailing on my ship. I met him inthe airport, greeted him and his wife and escorted them to their suite. I was very calm and collected but very starstruck after I left his side. He has my mobile number on the ship and calls me for everything. I am his personal assistant onbard. How cool is that??? I have met and spoken with him for about 2 hours this evening, arranging for his private access to the dining room, onboard bodyguard, priority disembark etc.  So as if that isn't enough, we have a slew of celebrities onboard including, Dennis Haskins (Mr. Belding from Saved by The Bell) and Richard Roundtree (Shaft!!).  Pretty cool as they all contact me for everything they need. We have a famous screenwriter onboard as well, Mr. & Mrs. Trepp.  They invited 70, yes 70! of their closest friends for a free cruise. They paid for it.  Pretty neato.  I am having a great time but working my ass off this cruise for these people. I can't wait to get my Dirty Dancing DVD autographed by the MAN!!! Hehehehe.  So exciting.  Anyway, he's calling me in just a few minutes to help him with some suite issues and thenlater tonight I will give him and his wife a private vessel tour.  Pretty exciting. Okay, enough for now I just had to write immediately tell everyone. Smooches, shelly.

      Hello all...  I have 7 weeks before landing in Houston, TX.  I am so excited.  I can't wait to come home, just to sleep in my own house, smell the fresh air for more than 2-3 hours every few days. I am anxious to visit my grandparents. Anxious to visit my mom and Richard.    Been bummed the past few days.  Just dealing with some issues. Nothing to elaborate on but it's just been a rough few days.  I keep looking towards the light at the end of the tunnel.  7 Weeks and counting.  My friend, Jason, the Entertainer, leaves tomorrow. I am sadden because he has been a great friend. He too will be returning to the Mercury after his vacation is over. Quite a few people are returning here. But, I will be sailing on.  Sailing on the Carribbean.  Many guests have told me that the Century ship is very elegant. I can't wait to see it.  Of course, I don't really want to think about my next contract because that means my vacation will be over.   Anyway, hmm.... I watched a great movie the other night. MatchStick Men. It was really cute.  No news really here. Just enjoying the fast pace of the 7 day cruises.  The weeks are flying by.  San Fran every 6 days. Wish I had more time to spend there though because I only have a quick hour or so to head to lunch and back to the terminal. I emailed my buds in San Fran but haven't heard back from them?!?! Hmm, maybe it's a done deal - no problem though. I think I will just go ahead and head directly home on the 29th so I will have a few days to get settled before Lizaki arrives in Houston. Probably come to Austin on the 2nd or 3rd and stay until the 4th. Then probably comeback there on the 13th. Hmm, I feel like this vacation is going to fly by.  It's tough working for 6 months straight and then ONLY having 2 months off. I was thinking that was a long time intially but now looking at it in retrospect, it isn't much time at all.    I think this next contract will be my last though.  I want to get some things taken care of on land and just finish out school, and move somewhere. Maybe to another state, I don't know.  I think it would be cool to live in another country for sure. I wish my next contract was going to be in the Mediterean, now that would be cool.  My friend Manuel, he's leaving in a week or so and heading for that itnerary.  They called for him to go to that ship - he was expecting to stay here for hi full contract.  Maybe that will happen to me and I will get to go to another ship in the middle of my next contract.   HMMM - Well, I guess I should run. I am having dinner with some guest tonight at 8:00 and I need to freshen up before heading to the dining room. Miss everyone greatly.   xoxox, Shelly  PS>>>>> Guess who's on next cruise with us??  Dennis Haskins - he played Richard Belding, th eprincipal in the series Saved By The Bell.  Hahahaa, how funny, ey????

      For why you must go to Bermuda???  For Why???  Okay another story. I am in Cabo today drinking my ass off. Lizaki and I went out last night for a few martini's to relax and chill and vent and those turned into about 4 vodka sodas in the crew bar.  nonetheless, it was fun.  We hung with my german friend, Nils. I mean Nilanaki.  Hehehe.  We have been here in this internet cafe for a few hours and it's cool.  We have such a good time together. This chick is so cool. Such a good friend  - I can't wait for her to meet AJ - god. How cool my two closest friends meeting.  So, Lizaki is coming to Texas - on the 1st of June.  And staying until the 5th.  Then we leave.  We leave, for a week.  Okay, I know, I know, everyone is probably like WHAT??? You are leaving, you just got here? Well, we found out that we can cruise on other ships for $10 bucks a day and so we have decided to go to Bermuda. Well, I have decided that a Bermuda trip is in order.  We have 3 overnights in Bermuda on the Horizon and I am planning to relax like all these assholes on our ship.  Just chill. So we will fly to Philadelphia on the 5th and head to Bermuda on the Horizon ship. I booked my flight today and so did Lizaki. So, I am psyched.  So, I will arrive on the 30th because I am overnighting in San Fran with my therapist friends.  I will sleep after a great dinner with lots of wine with my new family - Richard & My mom (they got Married yesterday!! I am sooo happy for them!!) and then Lisa arrives in Houston at 8:38AM on the 1st.  We will then begin our party fiasco.  Starting with an excellent brunch with Alan and Bob and hopefully my prego friend, Becka and then make plans for the evening.  I am hoping to head to Austin early in the morning on the 2nd and wake up AJ for a massive smoke out. Hehehe. Then to Tejas cafe with Lisa (from Austin) and Lizaki and hopefully Kevin, etc. etc. to enjoy some great mimosas.  Drink out our hearts and prepare for the evening.  Maybe Echoset can throw a show together so I can bathe in their limelight and enjoy their company.  If nothing else, we will scoot our asses to 6th street, drink and show Lizaki how the Texans/Americans party. And then off we go - back out into the open. Stay until the 4th, head to home to Houston and depart out of IAH to Philadelphia to board our vacation vessel.  Off to Bermuda.  God, I am so excited. This girl just makes me crazy - I have never in my life had such a kickass friend that just gets me more than anyone.  She can piss me off in a second but make me smile the next.  It's cool as shit to be in Mexico and hanging with one of your closest getting drunk.   It's fun as hell.  I can't wait to see you all though.  And I am even more excited that you will get to meet her. Granted we may speak our own language when we get there - Ella, Entax, Parakalo.  But no worries because you will all learn soon.  Heheheh.   PADDY!!!!!  HOw's Texas coming along??? Shit, I have missed everything for the last few months.  I feel out of the loop but I can't wait to tell you ALL about my adventures.  We have some incredible stories.  I am so happy here. Never been happier.  I miss you all but damn, it's cool here. I didn't realize it until a few days ago when I was getting ready to sign my signoff sheet for May 29th.  I am blogging the hell out of this site. Sorry.    For why. For why because I said for why.  I love you all.  i love you. i love you.  thank you for helping me get here. without you i wouldn't be here. i love you all.  yours, the dumbest craziest drunkess american.   oh yeah, my friend Jason says,m "Don't you remember in the 80's when alcoholism was light and breezey??" hahahahahahahahaha.

      It's has been so long since I wrote. I have so much to talk about - it's just ridiculous.    Let me first start out with last cruise, which was by far one of the most memorable of my entire contract.  It was our "Make A Wish" cruise.  We had six families onboard, each with one terminally ill child (ranging from age 3 to 18).  We also had several members of the foundation onboard along with one special family, Mr. & Mrs Stout and their 2 daughters.  I spent so much time with this group throughout the cruise and got to know their children and their stories very well.  Mr. & Mrs. Stout are a lovely couple from North Carolina.  In August of last year there youngest daughter (12) was diagnosed with a very rare form of osteosarcoma (bone cancer).  They began a huge battle trying to fight the disease and unfortunately their daughter, Hope, lost her battle with cancer in January of this year - but not before making the most amazing request.  Make A Wish foundation came to her door before she passed away and told her that her wish was to be granted - her wish was to grant the wishes of all 150 terminally ill children in her area.  Therefore, they begin a huge campaign and raised over 1 Million dollars to grant these wishes.  6 of the families chose to come on cruises and those were the families I was able to spend time with. (Along with the Stouts and there eldest daughters, Holly & Austin).  They begin journaling online when they found out Hope had cancer and I urge everyone to check out their website if you have some kleenex and need a reality check.  This family inspired me, all of them did - and I vow to get involved with Make A Wish when I return to land. Such an incredible story. These children are incredible. So strong for such weak bodies.  My heart goes out to all of the families and their trials.  Anyway, the website is www.caringbridge.org/nc/hope.  Please check it out.   Tim McGraw. Okay, one of the guests on my last cruise - his name was Tim McGraw.  I thought it was THE Tim McGraw along with all of my colleagues as well. It wasn't - just someone with the same name.  How stupid did I feel when I tagged his room key to meet him at embarkation??? Loser.  Windy-lickers. Or as my friend Helen from Scotland insists, "Windae-Lickers."  One night in the crew bar a few weeks ago, Helen, Lisa, Adam (our new sports coordinator), and a few others were having a few beers joking around.  We were talking about retarded people and their running joke on how I blanked on stage awhile back (more details on this later), and I realize that in Scotland they call retarded people, Windy-lickers because they usually have their tongues pressed against the windows of the bus.  I don't know but for some reason this just cracked all of us up...to the point where we can't even look at each other now with out saying, "Windy Licker."    It's interesting in all of my travels since November, I have learned so much.  I have learned conversational skills in Jamaican, Bulgarian, Thai, Greek, Scottish and Canadian - although the latter are more or less - just learning the slang words.  It's interesting though... as I near the end of my first contract - exactly 7 weeks from now- I have mixed emotions about leaving.  On one hand I can't wait to get home and visit with everyone, see my family and Jennifer and yet on the other end it's sad that I will not be returning to this ship.  i have made friendships here and shared something so special with all of these people that just will never be again.  When I leave, everyone I have been friends with will either stay or move onto another ship.  We have had some incredible times and I personally have made memories that will last me a lifetime. I have a nickname by all the greeks - It's official, I am Shell-aki.  I guess the name my mother gave me just wasn't right because I can't walk down the halls without someone whether it be waitstaff or the Captain calling me Shell-aki. It's neat.  It's just an example of how close we all are onboard Mercury.  I suppose it will be like that way at the Century ship. I suppose that is just the life in general.  It's definitely been a great experience though.  Really great.  So...on to the next topic - MAY 29TH!!  I come home.  Finally. I have been counting down for so long now. It's hard ot believe that I have less than 2 months now.  Lisa leaves on MAY 5TH and I am sure the following 3 weeks will fly by for me.  I was thinking of staying in San Fran for a day or two but to be honest I am so ready to go home and see my MOMMA I could scream. I miss her so much.  And I am missing a very important day for her tomorrow which makes me sad.  I am assuming I will come home, go out to dinner, and sleep for a few days.  Probably head to my grandparents and get back to Austin a week or so later. I can't wait to get to Austin.  Just to go to Flipnoticks, Waterloo, The Brown Bar (of course with you, Lisa), all my hangouts.  I can't wait to see live music (Not Mariachi Bands!!), eat great food and drink coffee on Town Lake.  I am looking forward to seeing my AJ.  I miss him so much.  I miss just laughing my head off with him and acting stupid.  It will be great to see everyone!!!!  Anyway, so we should plan a get-together and of course I will leave all the planning in Lisa's hands because she's so damned organized, it makes me sick. Let's do a happy hour, a dinner, a night out - whatever.  I just want to see everyone again and share my photos and stories and hear about what the hell has been going with everyone for 6 months!  I love you all, especially you Jen, and I will see you soon - VERY soon!  Shelly (aka Shell-aki)

      Hey hey kids in the kitchen, what's up??  I am sooo excited I will be leaving in just 1 day!! I can't believe the date is already here.  I keep thinking when I fall asleep what it's going to be like to not have to wake up and deal with cranky guests, events and the politics of ship life.  It's going to be absolutely incredible.  So, as I near my last few days I have been very reflective of the time I have spent here. The friends I have made, the unbelievable sites I have seen and the changes I have made within myself and the way I view the world.  I have encountered 56 nationalities along my journey, learned of countries I never knew existed and have written in this blogg almost every day to describe my adventures. All in all, the last six months of my life has taught more than I have learned in my life time.    Work hard, play hard and remember to care about the people you meet along the way. Remember to think of others before yourself because you never know what their life has given them. Always be on time to work. When you look your best, you feel your best. Never take a good night's sleep for granted. Taske advantage of the time you have with friends and family because you never when they may not be around.   I have learned so many things since being here - things I have grown up all my life hearing from my family.  It's just now, after being away for so long and experiencing other's losses, financial obligations to their families and personal sacrifices, I am truly inspired.    I look forward to another contract even though I know it will once again take me away from those that I love the most. But from all the world I have experienced in such a short time, I can't imagine letting go of this opportunity just yet.   See everyone very soon.  My love to all. Shelly

      OK, everyone must be tire dof reading my blogs about coming home.  Hahahah, am I just pathetic or what?  I am going to have a total dramatic airport entrance when I see my mother,  I am sure. I did get my flight plans though, I have about 10 hours of traveling which is just ridiculous because I should be flying directly to Texas.  I leave San Fran at 3pm on the 29th and have a connection in ATLANTA.    Isn't that ridiculous???? Freaking Atlanta. Anyway, 1 hour lay over there and arriving in Houston at 12:43AM. What a pain. I will not have much time to visit with my mom and Richard before we head to sleep to go to my grandparents' reunion the next day.  I am excited to see all of my family though as my grandmother has been updating them all on my travels.  I am sure I will be so tired ofhearing myself talk by the end of those 2 days.    Today was nice in Icy Strait Point but I didn't get off the ship because it was formal. I am always so busy on this day which just sucks in general.  Anyway, I got my afternoon nap and I finished watching the last 2 episodes o 24 Season One. Hopefully, our ACD, Bill will give me the season two set tonight. I am determined to watch all of these before I leave in 2 days. Hahahaah.  Okay, I will run now - picking up my table in about half an hour and then off to hang with friends for the night. Much love.  Shell

      okay, so can I just say that these last few days are going by at the speed of a turtle race. My goodness! I guess maybe it's because I am so anxious to get home.    I had such a great day today - chatting with Leah and Nick all afternoon and catching up on lost time. It was really fun, especially since my internet cafe had web cams! Yippee.   I just finished watching the last disc of "24" season one. I am so hooked on this show - it's just ridiculous.  I feel sorry for all of my friends and family because when I get home I am going to be situated on the couch watching the entire seasons I have missed. What a great show!!  Hmmm...no news here really. I talked with Lisa on the phone and she is getting siked about "THE" vacation to Bermuda. I am looking forward to it as well.  It will be so nice to lay on the beach and drink tropical drinks without having to worry about what time I have to be in uniform.  It is going to be incredible. I hear the sand is pink and Bermuda has the most gorgeous beaches in the world. I can't wait to go and hang out there. Lucky for us, we will have 3 overnights with the ship in port. We can come back to the ship as late as we want!!!  Meanwhile, I have had some very very pissed off guests calling me every five minutes on my mobile. Driving me freakin nuts! I keep wanting to tell them to **** off but every time I clam up. I guess it's a good thing that I don't tell them how I really feel. Hahaha.   Anywhooo poo poos, I am out - just wanted to send a shirt note to say hello. Smooches to all.

      Good afternoon or good evening for you.  It's only 2:30pm for me.  The rest of you are probably getting to go out on the town or whatever. Me, well, I will return to the ship shortly and go into work about 5:00ish.   Today has been fun - hung out with Tineke and her boyfriend Ralston. We went to the Red Onion Saloon and had some lunch.  Pretty weird having lunch in a 100 year old brothel hostel. It was established in 1898 as a whore house. I think they have a tour at 3:30 which I may go try and catch.  Today was awesome! I got to talk to my friend Nick on the computer and see him through the camera. It was so neat. I haven't seen his face in years so it was really special.   8 days and counting guys! I can't wait to come home!!! Somehow someway I have to find it in me to stay focused until I leave. Hmm, too many things going on though. As Adam sasy, "Eneh?" Hahaha, smooches.

      Ca-la'. Ever'ting is ever'ting as the Jamaicans say.  I started packing up somethings last night and that was such an incredible feeling. Only nine days left before flying home. I can't wait. I am so excited.  I hung out with a bunch of friends last night in the crew bar.  Didn't get back to my cabin until after 3AM so I was exhausted this morning.   I just finished for the afternoon so I think I will go and continue watching the first season of 24.  Damn, I am so addicted to this show.  Unfortunately, my friend John bought this season as a rip off in China so the last few episodes are caput. I am pissed about that already. I am going to have to find the these last few discs somewhere!    Meanwhile, work is going fine - just finishing  the last few days of training Linda (my replacement).  I can't wait to hand everything over. I started cleaning my desk today. I took down all of my bazillion photos and gathered all of my contacts from my files. I just need to swipe my email and clean out everything that is not needed. Yippee!!  Tomorrow we are in Juneau from about 1:00pm until 10:00pm.  I am looking forward to getting off the ship and breathing some fresh Alaskan air again.  The weather has been crummy today with drizzling rain and lower temperatures.  It reminds me of the fall in Texas - only this time I can't hear the sound of tires wheeling through the puddles.  I miss those simple sounds, guess I will have an "ear" full when I get home...  Must run for now but I send my love to everyone and I can't wait for the ECI Alum meeting. Smooches.  Shell

      Hey, hey there. How is everyone? Just writing a quick note to say Thank you to Lisa Letchworth for being so kickass. What a great friend. Thank you so much for sending the evite and organizing my return party at Paddy's.  I really hope everyone can make and don't worry I won't forget the photos. So, we are all set for Thursday evening. Thank you Paddy for opening up your home for an intimate gab session of the ECI trash-cakes.   Today was nice, busy though. We piled everyone back on the ship to return to Alaska this evening. We have a slightly different itinerary this cruise so it will cool to see and explore new the places I haven't seen. (Icy Strait Point).  This will be our first time in port here so I am in charge of setting the inaugural press conference and attending with the Captian. Sucha a photo op, ugh. Hahaha. Listen to my wee complaints. So, not even valid.   Meanwhile, I am getting very excited about my vacation to Bermuda.  I have only spoken briefly with Lizaki but I know she is getting siked too. She keeps telling me that she thinks I am going to kill her while we are in Texas.  I think she's terrified of meeting real Texans though. Hahaha. She's so funny though. I think everyone will get a kick out of here. Hopefully she won't tell too many stoires about stupid things I have done onboard. Hahaah.   Tonight is a little low key for me. Just kind of hanging out after the welcome aboard shows. I am watching the first season of 24 right now and damn it's good. I love watching them back to back. So, my little lame life will be in my cabin this evening, unless of course, Helen astarts banging down my door to go to the crew bar.   Smooches to everyone. See you in 11 days.   Shelly

      Sa Ba Di My Ca? How is everyone doing? I ask this question like someone can respond back. Hahaha. Anyway, I will take the silence as answer of good.   I have had a few very weird days.  It started with a really bizarre dream a fwe afternoons ago.  I dreamt that myself, my mom, Richard, Tineke and Helen had decided to take the glacier helicopter ride. We missed the ship and I had formal the next night. I had a huge panick moment. I actually woke up from the dream with tears streaming down my face. (Of course, very dramatic.) Then I fell back asleep and dreamt that I had a penis which was really, really bizarre. The weird thing is I didn't notice I had one - it just sort of appeared and then I couldn't figure out if I had it for my entire life or it was recent. Anyway, that dream has kicked off a series of very weird events. I got an email from someone that I haven't heard from in about 2 years maybe. That was really strange especially because I was so excited to hear from her.  My mother keeps writing me about this Van Morrison CD but I guess that's not that strange, if you know my mother. Hmm, things are just weird right now. I am wondering if I am going to wake up with a third arm or something.   Today, I didn't do anything really. I woke up at 11:00AM, went to work for about half an hour, then went back to sleep until about 4:00.  I talked to my friend Kevin on the phone which was really cool. Got to catch up with him for a bit. My cell has been working quite a bit this cruise which has been wonderful. I forget everyone has their own lives going on though, so when I call I expect everyone to drop what they are doing and talk to me. Selfish me.   Well, we are officially on the countdown now guys. I have 13 days left. I start training my replacement this evening and I can't wait to handover the pager and VS mobile phone to her. I am so tired of hearing it ring!!!  Lots of love and see everyone -PADDY- soon. Shell

      Avery good morning to everyone. How's the weather?!?!? It's cloudy and cold here today. It's foggy you can barely see the waves along the side of the ship. Guess we have crossed the canadian border. We are in Victoria, B.C. tomorrow then a day at sea and back in San Francisco on Monday. I have begun to pack up a bunch of things to send home. I don't know how I got everything on this ship initially. I have bought a ton of books while I have been here though. A lot of educational books and some "out there" reading.  I read the Idiot's Guide to the Roman Empire. Took me a couple of weeks to get through it but I learned quite a bit which helps me really take a stab at the greeks when necessary. I also bought an english to spanish dictionary and I didn't really read that one. Just skimmed trhough when we were in Mexico to brush up on my Spanish skills. I have a hundred dvds now as well.  Snding those all home. Hopefully I will not have any problems with customs getting these things off the ship.   I just got out of meeting and learned that I am getting a pay raise which is exciting. They are making it retroactive from January so it will be a nice bit to add to my savings. Yipppee.  Tonight's formal and I am running around getting last minute arrangments made. No Midnight Buffet tonight which is great because I hate hosting it at 11:30PM.  I am tired by the end of the night I just can't find the energy to be funny anymore. Hahaha. I am more on the lines of just funny looking.   I am looking forward to my toobing vacation in late June.  If anyone else is interested, let me know. I will forward the booking information to you for the cabins. I think we have confirmed June 28th or something - whatever the date is of the weekend BEFORE 4th of July.   OH YEAH - I finally saw that movie Elf with Will Farrell last night. Hysterical! I laughed my head off. "Who needs a hug??"  No news really here, just wanted to say hello and kill a bit of time. Sweet hugs to everyone and I will see you in 2 weeks!!! Yippee!!!  Shelly

      I went whale watching in Junewau very early this morning. It was sooo incredible. We took a tender boat out to middle of the ocean arounding surrounding landscapes of snow covered mountains and little islands.  I saw 4 killer whales with white markings, 2 humpback whales & a ton of seals.  It was just amazing. The ocena was so calm and the air was crisp. I will never forget the experience. I thought today about coming back to Alaska for 3 weeks and staying in a cottage. Just to experience the wildlife and live a simple life.  I saw 2 huge glaciers as well (the hubbard in the far view that we were able to view so closely yesterday.)  A spectacular experience. I took a ton of photos and can't wait to share with everyone.   Short blog today though as I am busy organizing my tables for tomorrow's final formal night. Must head off and finish!  Best wishes to everyone and see you in 16 days.    >>

      Good afternoon all... boy have I been busy today! It's now 3pm and I am just now breaking for the afternoon.  I spent 2 and half hour ont he Navigational Bridge this morning with about 20 VIP guests. It was so neat to stand there on the bridge with the Captain, Staff Captain, Safety Officer and the pilot and watch as we sailed trhough HUGE chunks of ice into the Glacier area.  I took a ton of photos so everyone will be witness that we were there. It was neat, very neat.   It's very cold in Alaska right now (obviously) but apparently this is nothing compared to the deadpan winters the locals experience. Nonetheless, it's a helluva lot colder than Mexico was two weeks ago.  I must say, I miss my little haunts in Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta & Ixtapa.  i wonder how my friend Elias is?!?! I should email him. Mental note just made.  So, everyone is clearing out of here like crazy.  The Chief Engineer is leaving on the 17th and then my favorite chief engineer is comnig back - Baltsavias.  He's so freaking awesome. My little Safety Officer just got back onboard. I sat with him in Disco last night for a few hours - I, of course, being the lush that I am, had about 3 CC's and sprite to his 1.  Hahaha, anyway, he was laughing at me because when i first got onboard I got toasted in the crew bar. He had to walk me back to my cabin as I kept banging into doors and falling over. Not a pretty sight at any rate. At least he has a good since of humor about it, I suppose. The program coordinator, Gina is leaving in Juneau tomorrow. I will miss her. Then a lot of us leave on the 29th.  A whoel new batch of people will arrive. I just can't wait to see my replacement - whew! I will then just hand over the pager, mobile phone handover notes and get her a uniform. I have already decided I am not working after she gets onboard. I can't wait!  17 days and counting. Everyone wish Jennifer a safe trip to Cambodia.

      Good morning everyone, well, it's still morning here. (11:30AM).  We are in Sitka today although I will not be able to check out the port because tonight is formal. I am busy running around getting all of my tables organized and of course must be in formal attire by 5:00pm.  It will be so nice to come home and retired all of these panty hose and heavy gowns. I plan to wear jeans and t-shirt everyday - well, almost everyday. Hehehe.  Yesterday was really nice. I woke up to huge beautiful mountains outside my porthole. I only worked for about an hour yesterday morning before heading off the ship.  I took the city transit into the very small town of Skagway.  Grabbed my usual double expresso and headed out to explore the city.  I went into a gorgeous fur shop and tried on a $9,000.00 beaver and fox coat. It was so soft I could never imagine wearing clothing underneath.  Wow! Tineke and I met up and went to this great sports bar called Bonanza's.  We had some burgers and a couple pints of Alaskan Amber beer. Really good stuff. We shopped around until dinner time and then went to this great seafood restaurant where we ate Alaskan King Crab. Wow - it was th ebest seafood I have ever had.  There were 3 ships in port so of course we had a bit of a wait but it was all worth it in the end.  We sailied last night 9:00p.m. and I was actually in bed by 10:00p.m.  Hahaha.  Well, I didn't go to sleep until late because I am watching this great UK DVD series right now called, Teachers. It's awesome - very funny to see the differences between American schools and schools in Europe.   Anyway, what else - still counting down my days. I have about 18 to go which I think will fly by.  I got an email from Lisa yesterday and she is getting excited about coming to Texas.  I am just getting excited about seeing my Mom and Grandmother. My two favorite people in the world.   Tomorrow we are sailing through the Hubbard Glacier and lucky me! I will be on the bridge with a bunch of VIP guests at that time. I am so excited to see this wall of ice and from the best place on the ship at that!  Oh yeah, there maybe some interesting news coming soon about my family-I am sworn to secrecy right now but as soon as I can, you will be the first to know! *wink* luv, shell.

      Alaska is incredible.  I must have heard a thousand stories from Jennifer about the beauty of this place but nothing compared to actually seeing it for the first time yesterday.  We crossed the Canada/US passage and sailed through the inside passage yesterday.  I spent 4 hour out on our crew deck looking at the mountains and the incredible stillness of the ocean.  Huge mountains with natural waterfalls about 10 meters away from the ship.  I took tons of photos while cruising through the passage.  At one point, while sailing, we were approximately 3 meters from shore. It drizzled a bit but I was bundled up in layers with my huge jacket on.  About 48 degrees.  My first Alaska experience really was spiritual - much like that Parasailing adventure in Mazatlan. Really quite.  I stood out on our deck just watching the scenery, breathing the fresh clean air and wondered what it would be like to kayack down the streams or go hiking through the mountains.  I think it was the first time in my life that I have ever considered doing any of those things.  There's just something about Alaska that makes you never want to smoke another cigarette or do anything harmful to the earth.  It's the most beautiful untouched piece of land I have seen.   Today we are in Ketchikan. A really small port for us but the neatest thing is that the ship is docked right at the quaintest part of the town.  Out my window sits our ship, a beautiful view of the mountains and several cargo ships around.  We ate in this fantastic country diner - complete with a breakfast bar and shabby looking waitresses who called us "Honey".  I had 3 cups of coffee and  a "country breakfast" with sausage gravy - it was soooooooooo freaking good.  Ketchikan has this small-town homey feel to it.  Pretty chilly today - I have a thick sweater on and my nose is freezing.    It's weird to think that I am actually in Alaska right now but really neat. I can't wait to get my photos developed to bring to show everyone. It's very cloudy here, the clouds hang so low you can just barely see the tops of the snow-covered mountains and everything is really green here. I don't know if it is the sky back drop that brings out these vivid greens or if it is just usual scenery here.  It's truly beautiful.   Tomorrow we are in Scagway.  We will be there until 9:00PM at night.  I think a few of us are going to go dog-sleding and hang out at one of the mountain cafes.  I must say this is just a really fantastic way to end my contract.  It's so much better than spending my last few cruises in Mexico and it is nice to be somewhere cold before coming home to the hot humid climate of Texas.   Just a special note to Mom - I love you so much and thank you for being so wonderful.  I am sorry I can't be with you on your day but know that I am thinking of you.  Happy Mother's Day!  20 days left. :-)

      Just got in from an incredible day in Vancouver and it is now added to the list of cities I must live in.  Think NYC without trash & taxi's everywhere.  The cleanest air I have ever breathed, the coolest clothing stores, and the best coffee north of California. I did nothing tourist-y today - just wlaked around wearing my white collared shirt with red sweater layered over and my black jacket, jeans & tennis shoes. It was about 59 degrees, overcast and rainy.  I ate sushi at a proper restaurant (minus my shoes) located above some cute shops facing the downtown district.  Drank hot tea and laughed with Helen over stupid things.  Afterwards we went to the coolest bookstore and hung out for a couple of hours, sitting on the floor, listening to music and drabbing around the travel section.  I did my usual walk-over to the reference center and contemplated what language I want to teach myself when I get home.  First picking up the french guides, then on to greek guides before racking my brain over mandrin chinese  - I do this every time I go into every bookstore now - always in the same order - some type of OCDism I am suffering from. Hahaha. Anyway, we picked up coffee at Tim Horton's and sat outside on the porch, smokin, watching the rain and people surfing.  It was the greatest day ever and I did nothing out of the ordinary.   I bought this incredible bootleg cd of Sarah McLachlan - wow, just looked outside the window and noticed that we were sailing out of the port..... Bye, Vancouver! Anyway, this cd rocks - it's with the freedom sessions and all of the versions are previously unreleased. She sings Ol'55 and I have never wanted to "ride with Lady Lcuk" so badly before.  Yowsers, it reminds me of why I love music so much.   I can't get over how beautiful Vancouver is.  I mean, the mountain back drop is incredible - white capped with snow and all the wee houses are perched so elegantly at the bottom. We will be back here on the 19th and I plan to truly spend some time in the gardens which I have heard are amazing to see. Tomorrow we are cruising the inside passage which is supposed to be pretty neat - huge trees on both sides of the ship. I guess I will have ot take some photos.  I took some today but mainly it was of the metropolitain district.   Okay, now, Hummel Hummel.  In Hamburg, Germany the locals shout this at everyone but apparently it's the only place in Germany where they say these things.  One Hamburg says to the other, "Hummel Hummel" and the other says, "Mosh Mosh."  I still haven't gotten the right translation but it's something like, "Screw you." and th other says, "Screw you too."  But apparently, old women to young kids say this as a greeting.  Hahaha, is that psychotic or what?  So, I said to Nils last night - "Hummel Hummel" ad he just looked at me like I had lost my mind.  Then responded with the response. It was hilarious.  He's from an island off the coast of Hamburg so he knew exactly what I was saying. Hahaha.    Alright,  I have blabbed enough.  More later.  Oh and 22 days left. Smooches. Shell.

      GUess what? We got ou new Alaskan Uniforms today!  They are sooo nice and I have stripes! Yippee!  The uniform is a black tailored, double breasted jacket with gold celebrity buttons and my stripes are on my forearms. We have the cutest white collared shirt with black bow tie and a matching black penicil skirt underneath.  THey are the sharpest uniforms evre! I don't mind wearing these drabs. ANywa, i have had fun sporting the new look today.   Tonight is formal and of course I am slammed busy.  We just got the old but new cruise director back, Julian. We are all feeling th eimpact even with just one day behind us now. He just works very differently from all of us - very scattered in thoughts and doens't quit understand how his program affects s all. Anyway, I am just thankful that I don't have too much longer to endure.   I am so excited about being in Vancouver tomorrow! We will be arriving about 11:30A and will be there until 6:00pm. I am planning to spend most of the day off the ship, doing some shopping, taking photographs and just having lots of coffee.   Alirght, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CARVING is calling. ughhhhh, how many more of these do I have to do???? Only one more after today!!!! Yippee!!!  Smooches all, Shell.

      3 and a half weeks left - thats it. Then, I will be home. Lisa left today - she was just glowing with happiness. I was going to give her the finger as I said before but I just gave her hug instead.  It will be so cool to see her in Texas on the 2nd. Next contract is going to be so different from this contract - just all new people, well with the exception of a few familiar faces. Daniel, Chief Conceirge will be there - he was here earlier in my contract. Nice guy from UK. Hmm, who else.... I guess I will be surprised when I get there. Hehehe.  It was beautiful day in San Fran today.  A little chilly but nothing compared to weather I will feel in a few days as we sail through icebergs in Alaska.  We arrive in Vancouver on Friday morning and the begin sailing the inside passage of Alaska. I am so excited to take lots of photos.   Nothing new here - just getting excited. I am sure these last few weeks are going to go by so slow ismply because I am looking forward to leaving so badly.  I am just looking forward to sleep in general! And not having to worry about a pager going off in the middle of the night for a medical emergency (like last night at 4:30am).  I had just fallen asleep a little after midnight when I was awoken at 4:30 with my pager scremaing "starcode: stateroom 9018".  I have never put my uniform on so fast. Fortunately, the woman was fine after suffering a major diabetic shock. The doctor gave her some insulin or sugar or whatever through IV and she was good again. Pretty scary though. You know they say these things come in sets of three so you can imagine my worries about the next two. Ughhhhh.  Well, I should run - gotta head up to the bridge shortly to visit with the Captain. Hope all is well and I send a thousand kisses to all of you.   Love, Shell

      i feel sad today. i am going to give Lisa the middle finger tomorrow when she steps off this ship to go home. i am so jealous. i wish i could be going home tomorrow.   i am tired. i am cranky. i am fake to people on the phone. i hang up my mobile and my face goes back to the scoul i was wearing before it rang. i am just tired. i have lines under my eyes that i never had before. my hair is a mess and i look like i haven't slept in days. i don't think i have actually.   i am tired of the gray walls, the port hole, the brown blankets on my bed, the blue carpet, the music on the piano, the food, the job - everyhting is losing it's luster after 5 months. i need a vacation damn it.   25 days left and counting.

      hello my fellow friends - man, i have been doing a lot of blogging lately. guess because the only thing i can think of right now is coming home. getting back to some normal life with normal friends, etc. 27 days and counting now. i spent this afternoon having lunch with lisa and tineke, then headed to my favorite internet cafe for one last time. i have sat here this afternoon looking at a thousand websites and emailing people i haven't spoken to in months. weird. but i guess when you are ored, you do things like that. Next friday i will be in Vancouver. then alaska. yippee. i can't wait to whale watch and take tons of photos. i found out aerosmith is playing in houston on june 4th and so is bob schneider. yippee.  that will be cool.   it's been gorgeous the last few days - we are definitely in the mexico season for sure. cabo has been incredible today although i have been watching from inside.  i am too sunburned to venture out to the beach. whew. i didn't sleep well at all last night. just tossed and turned. i went to the crew party after watching monster. wow, what a movie. has anyone seen that movie??? omg, it was incredible. disturbing but incredible. go charlize theron. wannabe lesbo. hehehe.  so, yes, god - i can't wait to see everyone. every night i go to sleep thinking about seeing everyone's faces. it will be strange to be back in austin again.  i have changed so much - still the same person underneath my fancy clothes but just different. i think about things so differently now. even as i sat here today surfing websites that were a daily view for me at eci, i just look at everyone differently. ivalue the friendships i had even more. the relationships. hmm, i am on a soapbox today i guess. must be that inner sunday feeling coming out today.   so, i will go back to the ship shortly. have to meet with the captain at sailing on the bridge to discuss tables for tomorrow night and then i have 2nd seating formal dining tonight. ugh, i never thought i would be so tired of 5 course dining - it just takes so long!! then off to the Newleywed - Not so Newleywed game where i cohost with our cruise director. 10:45 - won't be done until 11:30 -ughhhhhh. then another day of seeing my retarded facial expressions on celebrity tv all day tomorrow. hahahahahahhaah.   ****mental note - don't drink too much wine at dinner tonight.****  Okay, luv you. smooches.

      Hello All my Peeps. How is everyone this fine - um, what day is it? - Saturday?? Yeha, i think that's right.  I had the most gorgeous day in Puerto Vallarta today. Nils, Lisa and I headed to the Crystal Hotel around 1pm and just enjoyed the sun and pina coladas. I was exhausted when i got back from the ship and I took about a 2 hour nap before coming into work at 6. Then Lisa and I snuck away for a Martini in the Martini Bar. It was fun. She's so excited about going home - I don't blame her. i will be the same way in about 29 days. Sounds like a long time but it's around the corner.  So, we are trying to figure out where we will stay when we are in Austin. I am tihnking of renting hotel because I don't want to inconvenience anyone since we will be in during the middle of the week. I think i will figure something out. I am sure of it. Hmm.  PADDY! How are you my friend?   I got the greatest emails today from my friends around the world. Can you imagine - 3 emails from different sides of the world? One from Fotis in Greece, One from Daniel in the UK and one from Dave in New Zealand! I can't wait to visit all of these wonderful plces one day. I sat with tons of friends last night discussing how the new EU will affect there countries. Such interesting conversations, I swear.   Okay, I am fire - the sun kissed me today and burnt the hell out of my skin (even with 35 spf!). i need to go grab some dinner and then off to the cinema to watch "Monster" with Charlize Theron. I know I am way behind on my moves here.   Luv.

      You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise.  Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room.  Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise.  Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries?  Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard.  You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise.  Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs?  Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.  Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise I rise I rise.

      As I rode the Metro Park and Ride into Downtown this morning, I stared out the window and thought about this question. I encourage everyone to post a comment answering this question - but to truly think about it before you make a post. Never before have I given this question true thought outside of the interviewer's 5 minutes of anxiety. So, I ask you...  Where will you be in 10 years?   I personally see myself working in a major record label company as the marketing and public relations manager for maybe 3 or 4 bands. Juggling lots of travel and invitations to posh parties. I see myself living a relatively conservative professional life, making good money and buying a quaint lake property somewhere in Austin. I see myself vacationing internationally for 3 or 4 weeks during the summer and spending my Christmas' somewhere ultra cold.  I see lots of charity work, a busy calendar and a personal assistant to die for.   **Pray for our service men in Iraq. Another soldier lost his life to those low-life monsters.**

      Je suis dans une humeur de merde. Vous jamais avez ces jours où vous êtes si ennuyé, vous cherchez juste l'internet pour les choses bizarres les plus faites au hasard que vous ne penseriez jamais d'à moins que vous aviez tel ennui arrive ? Bien, il m'est arrivé aujourd'hui. J'ai trouvé quelque chose que m'a fait nauséabond. Quelque chose qu'a cassé mon coeur et a fait me questionne chaque sensation sûre que j'avais. Je ne me suis pas senti beaucoup comme l'écriture dans ce journal aujourd'hui parce que j'avais peur de ce que pourrait sortir. Si, cela est pourquoi il a été perdu dans la traduction. Si pour quelque raison vous parlez cette langue et avez géré pour obtenir mon blog pour aujourd'hui alors la façon va aussi. Désolé il ne pourrait pas ; être plus d'intéresser.   Vous jamais avez trébuché ? sur quelque information telle que je ? Quelque chose trouvé que vous a fait hors aussi a étourdi pour le mentionner juste à l'autre personne ? Vous a écoeuré juste parce que vous avez su avec émotion que quelqu'un a été débranché ? je ne sais pas. Quoi que.   Je ne sais pas. Semble être ma chose préférée à dire.

      Good rainy Sunday afternoon to everyone. I just got back home after a wonderful weekend in New Bransfels (sp?).  It was soooo much fun.    The weekend started for me on Thursday night though and it was a lot of fun - Jen, Lisa, Megan, Kristi and I went out to dinner at Z-Tejas and then went out on the town. We had a ton of fun and both Kristi and Jen were just so freake dout because they met "Cat Osterman."  I am sure a billion of you out there are like, "Who the hell is that?" Don't worry, I have provided you a link with all the Cat Osterman information you could want. The link is above. It was neat and even more meaningful after I googled her named and saw exactly how cool this girl really is.  She's the only college chick on the US Olympic Women's Softball team. Go Cat!  The remainder of the weekend was a lot of fun. Friday was definitely jello shot night and we had tons of fun on the river yesterday. The weather was perfect yesterday and we had lots of fun floating down the river. Of course, we lost 3/4ths of our beer after the first rapid but fortunately we had some great help from Jennifer and Nick scoring some beers at the end of the trip.  I don't think I have laughed so hard in a very long time. The family enjoyed spending together and I personally was really excited to have Jen with me. My family just loves her to death.  I got cranked up after being on the river all day and I wanted to go out to Gruene Hall alst night. unfortunately, everyone else was very sunburned and tired from the days events. I had to shut my honky tonk down and earlier than I had hoped but I was thankful when I woke up this morning with out a headache!  The drive home today sucked sooo bad.  I am sick of all of this rain! I don't think it is ever going to stop! I actually had to pull over on the side of the road for about 10 minutes to let this huge storm pass. I thought there was going to be a tornado for sure!!! Hahahah.   I will post pictures as soon as we get them developed. Much love. Stay dry. Shell

      Good morning folks. Swam into work today. Soooooo much rain here. Lots of storms all week - everything is soaked!  Mother and I took the HOV-HOMO lane into work this morning and almost died a few times as we hit puddles of water that almost slammed us into the side walls.  Very scary. Needless to say, I arrived at work with no makeup and my hair standing on ends (I was driving...).  I am excite about going to Austin today.  And I am even more excited about going to San Marcos as well - granted it will be raining I am sure. It will just be nice to hang out with my new family and spend some time with them. Mother made jello shots last night (about 100) and I think the blackberry flavored as lethal. (May have to sample one just to make sure.)  Yesterday, I spent most of my day listening to Bob Schneider's newest cd online.  It's such a great album.  Jennifer actually bought the cd and we listened to it a bit last weekend but I wanted to check it out for myself. His website is  http://www.bobschneidermusic.com  and the album can be listened to in it's entirety. It's also kind of neat because Bob has a commentary before each song where he explains the origin of the song, who wrote it and how he felt about it. He rambles a lot but it's kind of neat to here the back side of the album. His website is neato too.   Okay, my new favorite game online is COLLAPSE and you can download it at msn.com. Such a fun game - think Tetris cubed. It's just fun and very addicting. I quit playing for a few minutes and then I feel like I have to play it again. My high score is over 2 million points - who can beat me?!?!?!?!?!? NO ONE!  I am scanning in tons of documents for my mother right now so I should run.  I don't think I am ever going to finish this crap job!!!  ~~~~YUCKY~~~~  Oh yeah, make sure to check out the ACL Fest line up. Sheryl Crow!  http://www.aclfest.com   smooches, shell

      or at least this is what my horoscope told me today.  What the heck does that mean? Hmm....I will have to think about that one for a bit.  It's Wednesday, finally, and I am sooo glad. I am leaving for Austin tomorrow after work to hang with Jen before we head to San Marcos for the weekend. It should be a lot of fun.  (Although, it has been raining a lot and it may even been raining this weekend, ewwww.)  So, it's June 23rd. I can't believe I have been home almost a full month.  It feels like forever - yet, not quite.  I don't know. Hmmm....strange.   So, a guy I grew up with (kinda - actually my aunt and uncle taught him in school and he lived in the same small town as my grandparents) has nthis totally kick ass website devoted to his incredible talent as a web designer. His site is awesome complete with great music and a showcase of his incredible photos. You must check it out. Go to Section 3, (Photos), And click Places.  This photos were taken in the same town as my grandparent's - Apple Springs, TX 75926.   www.screamingchaos.com  is the website.   what else? can't really think of anything. Everyone should join  www.friendster.com  too - it's fun and I need more friends. Even Beyonce is a member - click on the link of the day on the title of this blog.   Love you, have a great Wednesday. Oh and I will have some photos to post after this weekend.

      I am currently holding on the phone (22 minutes and 19 seconds now, no 25, 26 27, 28 seconds) with some whack job at Cingular Wireless just practically foaming at the mouth. These people are so ignorant, I swear! (My phone bill was mailed yesterday to the tune of $528.00). Yeah, right. They charge dme over $350 in roaming charges when I have a national plan.  Morons. Ughhhhh.  Anywhoooooo, I am getting this straightened out now.  It's raining again. Ugh. Suppposed to have bad weather all day and tomorrow here in Houston.  I have my own office and outside my huge window is just a gray mist and wet streets. Nasty for sure. Thank goodness I am on park and ride today so I won't have to face the traffic at 5:30p.m.  I watched part of the movie Big Fish last night. Such a weird flick. I lost interest as 11:00p.m. neared and just went to bed. Maybe I will finish it tonight. Hmm, don't know. I think mother and I are making jello shots tonight for this weekend.   Well, no news here. Lots of love. Hi Paddy.    Don't Forget to Click the link above.

      --> just a note, you can click on the title of my post for the link of the day.---->  What a great weekend. One of the best I have had in a long time. Jen and I went with her wonderful friend Randy to Port Aransas to fish. (Yes, I know most of you are probably gasping at the thought of me with a fishing pole...)  We left on Friday morning bright and early and arrived midafternoon to set up camp.  Randy was nice enough to drive his huge (I mean, HUGE) RV complete with a bedroom, two tvs, full kitchen, sofa - it was rockstar style.   We went fishing on Friday afternoon after setting up camp for the weekend. I didn't even know how to hold the pole or put the shrimp bate on, or anything for that matter. Randy gave me a 15 minute Fishing 101 course and I was good to go then. I was out there like a pro. We all caught some fish but Randy caught 2 sting-rays (or "see-rays"). Hahaha. Nonetheless, it was a great relaxing weekend. I didn't poke anyone's eye out with my hook or get grossed out, etc.  I did however, catch this amazing T-shirt and tons of seaweed. Hahaha. I seriously thought that T-shirt was the largest fish in the world until I pulled it out of the ocean and saw what it actually was. :-( Oh well.  So, my link is for the Women's Bass Fishing Association.  I must say these women are really scary but my guess is that they can fish better than any man out there. Apparently, this fishing thing is PRO-fish-ional. Oh corny. Whatever.   Lots of love. Everyone enjoy your Monday.

      are bullshit. i thought it would be kind of neat to add the feature onto my site but i don't know. i got some horrible response from "someone" and i am changing my mind about the added feature.  people are so full of animosity. i mean, if you have something to say - why post it on an anonymous comment board?!?! why not just send the proper email and express your frustration???   ugh, whatevva. had to vent.

      my woman - the love of my life - she's sleeping right now, in her bed, in Austin.  i am awakened, of course, because i am thinking of her....okay that was cheesey. she has no idea how excited i am to see her this weekend.   not because i shaved my precious jewel for her, okay partly, but mainly because she's my love.  i have done nothing to deserve her, absolutely nothing - but for some reason she still loves me and i am soooo fucking greatful - excuse me baby.  She hates it when I curse, or when I smoke or when I represent anything but myself... which I don't blame her for - she wants me as I was in November.  God, I am that girl - just a little more confused because I want to be her WOMAN in an adult life. I am a TALENTED, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN lost without her.  None of that matters. I can't wait to sleep next to her.  Feel her breath on my shoulder without her knowledge.  God she's beautiful - just gorgeous.   I love my Jen.

      "I've fallen in love with you"  Damn, that song rocks.  Actually the whole cd rocks in general.  She's young though. Think older black woman and put a young white girls face to the voice.  She's just very soulful. Actually I read that this cd she has released was released way before Curve Records wanted to release it.  She's just too damned good. She recorded The Soul Sessions in 4 days. That's incredible.   Okay, enough about music (even though my heart bleeds for new artists), I am coming to the close of a long day. I don't like working 9-5.  It sucks. It's just so damned repetitive - I mean I miss my afternoon naps that I used to get from 1:30-4:30p.m. every day.  Hahaha, I am so spoiled.  Congratulations to my friend Bekah who gave birth to her 2nd baby, Carter, today. i get to be an Auntie again. Hehehe (oh to her excitement...hahaha).  I have always told her that if she ever wants her kids to learn anything, she should let me babysit for a few days. When Emma's 8 yrs old, she'll be shaving her leggs and wearing Prada. Hahaha. Oh, what a thought.  I don't have much to write. Just thinking about everyone. Hi Paddy.  Love.

        "Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense." — Ralph Waldo Emerson    I just returned from Austin. Start work tomorrow in Mom's office.  Feeling crummy for the past few days. Just stressed out about so many things and i fear that not even a Zoloft, Paxil or other antidepressant would lift my spirits right now. Just some time and carefully thought out plans.   Thank you Lisa for the wonderful comfortable abode this weekend and more importantly for being a great friend with excellent listening skills. Sometimes I feel like I would never stop talking to you if I didn't have to stop and breathe every once in awhile.   Anyway, not much news to share - just here, back in Houston for awhile. Will be around if anyone needs anything.   Love, Shell

      Hey kids, just got back from an excellent lunch and an afternoon movie.  I met up with my old friend Alan and we went to Matsu, a new sushi restaurant in northwest Houston. We ordered so much sushi and sat there talking and gorging for about 2 hours. Then we headed off to see an afternoon movie - against my choice, we saw Mean Girls.  Not a bad flick but much too teenie bopper for me.  Very gay-boy friendly though and nonetheless we had some laughs. It was so weird to just be hanging out and doing nothing. It's starting to sink in that I have no job right now. I think I am going to go crazy!  Fortunately, or unfortunately, not sure yet, my mother has lined up some work for me at her office.  I will be able to help with some research, filing and other dubhub jobs around her office for about 3-4 days a week starting next Monday. It will be a good opprtunity for me to spend some time with her, learn more about her profession, make some extra cash and more importantly keep me out of trouble.  (I seem so prone to that these days...go figure.)  I don't know about you but I am sick to death of all the rain we have been having.  It isn't suppose to stop raining here until Saturday and I haven't even begun to check the Austin forecast.  I am driving into Austin tomorrow though - going to finally see my AJ after almost 7 months!!!!  I can't wait to see him.  We are planning to go to an afternoon yoga class tomorrow afternoon and do some calorie burning. (luckily!)  Well, no news really here other than that above.  I am enjoying my time at home and resting mostly.  It's tough for me though - I have been waking up every morning at 6:30a.m. - just because my body clock is so off. I am so used to only having 5 1/2 hours sleep a night so when I hit 6, my body just wakes up.  Sucks really bad because I am always really tired in the afternoons.  Oh woe is me. Hahaha.  Lots of love, Shelly

      5 days in Austin and I mentally drained. Long story but obviously I am not in Bermuda right now.  A combination of things just did not allow me to leave on Saturday. Lisa did not go either but that's a whole other story.   Coming home felt wonderful.  I arrived in Houston on the night of 29th and was greeted in the airport by my mom and Richard. It was really nice to see them especially after such a long flight from San Fran home.  My mother wanted to stay up until 4AM in the morning chatting so I didn't get much sleep that first night as I was leaving early the next morning for the Family Reunion.  It was soooooooo great to see my grandmother. I also went to visit them on Tuesday for the day.   I got into Austin on Wednesday and it was just CHAOS from the moment I got there. Not necessarily crazy partying but just people were very different. Everyone was the same but a little stranger looking to me, familar faces that I couldn't remember the names to match.  I got to see a lot of people I knew especially at the Pride Festival on Sunday. Another story I just will not write about here. (Damn, has my blog just gotten way to personal here???).  It was sooo nice to see all my ECI Alumni peeps. Thank you to Lisa Letchworth and Paddy Langford for organizing everything and allowing us to be at his place.  Thanks to everyone for coming over - it was truly special to see all of you.  I felt so loved and so supported.  You have no idea how much this meant to me. Thanks again.  I am back in Houston tonight...which is great. It's good to just be at home where things are much simpler.  I can lay on the couch and not worry about everything that is eating my alive right now. It was tough drive for me home - just bad weather and a lot on my mind.  Well, I am not much in the mood for writing now but just thought I would check in for a bit and let you know I am alive. Not sure when I will be Austin again but will keep you posted.   smooches, Shell

        How cool does this sound??? (I know, most of you are probably laughing at the though of me treckin around in some jungle without a minibar - but gimme a break here).&nbsp; This sounds like such a memorable&nbsp;adventure. Hmm. One to ponder.     &nbsp;

         If I don't get on a plane tomorrow at 3pm it's going to be a miracle. Tomorrow I am scheduled to leave for the Carribbean. I have my flight details, my hotel confirmation and my ticket to join the ship.&nbsp; It's a weird feeling to know that I am not going back.&nbsp; A good feeling but a weird feeling. Especially since&nbsp;I have talked to my friends Tineke & Fotis. They are on that ship. Hmm, I am positive that I have made the right decision though. I have taken the road less traveled I suppose. I don't think anyone has taken as many detours as I have along my life's path.        &nbsp;    Cest Le Vie.        &nbsp;    Meanwhile, I got an 80 on my first government exam. I was pretty siked about it.&nbsp; A lot of people bombed and I felt like one of the smart ones in the class. that was a good feeling. Anyway, tomorrow is my aerobics mid term but it's open book and not very formal so I am sure I will ace it.        &nbsp;    I finally got to see the first pilot episode of "The L Word" tonight. I was so siked! It was a great show, although I may have completely scarred my mother for life. Bless her heart, in all her wonder, she tries to be supportive of me and lesbo life. She did have to leave the room a few times just because I know she was dying of embarrassment. Hahaha, it was funny. I did appreciate her support. I think the character of "Shane" is so smoking hot. Wow, I odn't know if it's just the confidence she exudes or her lanky little rockstar body.&nbsp; She's smoking though.&nbsp; If you haven't caught this show (whether you're gay or straight) check it out. It will definitely give you some insite into some of our lives.        &nbsp;    Also, since I am on the television topic - check out Trading Spouses tomorrow night. It's hysterical. OMG. Lord, please don't ever let me relate to either one of those women. And if I have to choose a life of one of theirs, let it be Amele's - as little as she has, wow, at your happiness level.        &nbsp;    Alright, I should finish this glass of Cabernet and head my happy azz to sleep. Sweetest of lovely dreams to everyone.        &nbsp;    Shell         &nbsp;      &nbsp;

      Alright, all my republicans and democrats - get out and vote, damn it!  There are "Meetups" being held all around your city and now is the time get involved! I love presidential years-  a time of change and broken promises to begin. Ok, that sounded jaded and pessimistic  - forgive me. Go vote.   Happy Saturday - I am at home being bored as heck today. Just did some laundry and still in my pjs (after 12:30pm). Anyway, maybe I will go shopping or go see a movie. So much alone time. Hmm, can it be a good thing?!?!  Love, Shell

      I always fall for this lame ass crap.  It feels like the moment I found out that the Blair Witch was a hoax. Ughhhh.   Shyamalan Talks Buried Secret (http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2004-07/20/10.15.sfc)  Director M. Night Shyamalan told SCI FI Wire that he admires SCI FI Channel for the controversial way it promoted the original special The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan. "Those guys are awesome," Shyamalan said in an interview while promoting his upcoming film The Village. "Those guys are awesome at SCI FI Channel. They're really kind of ballsy, creative people. I really dig them."  SCI FI admitted on July 16 that it created a story that was part fact and part fiction as a way to publicize the documentary, which premiered July 18, and that it did not have a falling out with the director, as previously reported in the media and on SCI FI Wire (June 16, July 7 and July 8).  Shyamalan said SCI FI should be forgiven for the hoax. "If they erred, they did it out of enthusiasm for the project," he said. "But they're really cool people. You know how, in basketball, there are those 'hustle errors.' The coach always loves that. It's cool."

      In the midst of taking one of my 25 breaks froms tudying this afternoon, I went to the houston Chronicle website to catch up on the city-hap for the day.... Low and behold - we have a serial killer!! Yikes. Well, the police aren't calling it that yet but damn it definitely sounds like we have a freak on our hands. People are so whack, I swear. Anyway, I had to call Jennifer and talk to her on the phone so I didn't get scared (how pathetic right?) I just had this errie feeling about the whole article, I don't know. Weird. Well, and the location of the body found today is only about 2 miles north of my house (which is even scarier?!!?!?).  Hmm, maybe the serial killer won't want me since I am not in my mid-30s. That seems to be what's he/she's looking for.  Okay, Jennifer is going to seriously laugh at me but what the hell - an interesting link for today comes to you from her - she told me about this crazy scary documentary she watched about the director of the latest "Village of blah blah blah".  Anyway, check it out.... http://www.scifi.com/mnight/main.html  Hmm, nothing else really - except tomorrow is THE TEST.  I have studied all afternoon and I think I can safely say my eyes are now completely crossed. I know I could study more but I am afraid that I am just confusing myself with too much information.  I think I will quit for now and review again before falling asleep.  Maybe even get up earlier in the morning to flash through my cards one more time. Damn, I am just so paranoid about this frekaing test. How pathetic (once again.)  Ok loves, I am off for now. Take care. Sweet dreams!  Shelly

      Hello all, how is everyone this fine Monday?  I am a little tired today considering I didn't fall asleep until after 2:00AM this morning. I don't know what the hell was wrong with me. I just layed there with my eyes closed, tossing and turning - very strange. 6:30Am came awfully early this morning for sure.  I have been studying all afternoon trying to prepare for my first exam on thursday.  Covers 6 chapters and I am pretty nervous about the exam since this will be my first by this professor. First tests of the semester always suck. Anyway, I filled out my online evaluation of this government professor and I felt really good about the feedback I provided. Basically, I wrote that she needed a public speaking class because there should never be 300 ums out of your teachers mouth in hour and a half.   Well, just a short side note to say hello.  Helen (from Scotland) emailed me today. She may come to texas for a visit with my friend Jason. Would be awesome if she did. She is hysterical!!! Everything is grrrrrreat.  Hehehe.  Oh, back to the books. Love, Shell.

      Sorry, it has been so long since I wrote - my goodness?!?! I thought I would have a chance on the 14th but I guess something came up. As usual. I just got through watching Monster with my mother. She had never seen it and I told it was part of our Prostitution Sundays ritual.  We seem to watch some of the weirdest movies on Sundays - I don't know how it happens. We had a good laugh about it though.   I had a great weekend in Austin. Jen and I hung out on Thursday night and went tooling around downtown.  Saturday was fun -  we saw Napoleon Dynamite!  It comes out nationally this week I think - you have to see it. It was hysterical. Thank goodness, I have my, "My lips hurt real bad!" Chapstick. Hahahahaha. Oh, you had to be there. Check out the official website - it's down righ tnow but hopefully it will be up and running soon. http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/napoleondynamite/fanclub/index.php  Kid on Bus: What are you gonna do today, Napoleon?  Napoleon Dynamite: Whatever I feel like I wanna do, gosh!   I wish I could insert sound here.  Oh man, Lisa and I must have laughed about this for 4 hours - actually we all did, Jen included.  Thanks for lunch on Friday, Paddy. It was yummy.

      I wrote a long post yesterday and then AOL kicked me off so, you know, I was frustrated. I just left it.  When I get in this afternoon though, I will definitely make a long interesting post.  Love, Shell

      I don't get it. It just seems like every time I read about child pornography, a priest is attached to the discovery of evidence.  I don't get it. Can someone help me here? Is it boredom? Ugh, none the less, today's link is about ANOTHER priest and child pornography.  I just realized I haven't written in quite a few days. Just been busy I suppose. Jen came to visit me on Thursday afternoon and we had a wonderful 2 days. I have quit smoking and so I have been a little irritable. Poor girl, she didn't know what hit her, I don't think. I am feeling a little better with the occassional hair pulling nail biting craving.  I try not to give in.   School is going really well. I hav enow entered my first official week of government and aerobics.  We had our first full work out in Aerobics today and I swear there will be no excuse for me not to be skinny in 4 weeks. Hahaha. Of course, my mother has me on some weight loss diet plan right now. I am so hungry this afternoon that i could eat the pencil laying on my books. Nonethless, I am approaching dinner time and that's exciting. Hahaha. How pathetic I sound. Truly.  Hope all is well with everyone. Lisa mentioned an ECI Happy Hour on Friday - Maybe Trudy's, etc?  i would love to catch up with everyone and maybe I can talk Jen into coming along as well. I would love for everyone to meet her.   Ok, smooches. Shell.

      So tomorrow is the big day. It feels like my first day of high school - a little intimidating, exciting, wondering who I will make friends with and how my classes will add up.  So strange?!?!? Nonetheless, I am excited and think it's going to be fun to learn about the government.....(bah, humbug.) I don't know about how much fun it will be to get up and be in class by 7:30AM. I guess the good thing is that I will be done by noon and I still have the entire afternoon to study. Will keep everyone posted on my developments.   Jen and I watched Spellbound this weekend. I don't know if you have seen this documentary in your local video store but if you have contemplated checking it out - do it!  It was really interesting.  I just love the National Spelling Bees and to see how these kids prepare is just insane. And for some reason (I don't know what the hell is wrong with me?), I always cry when the kids win.  It just seems like such an accomplishment. It's chick flick without the intention of being one. Hahaah. Go get this documentary though. It's really cute and makes you feel like a dumb kid because you never tried as hard as some of these kids.   I got an email from my good friend in Amsterdam yesterday. Kim? Anyway remember me talking about her?  She's so funny - she's actually not going back to the ship either. (Oh by the way, I am not going back to the ship. Ha.) I think it's just an experience that one should have in their life once - It was fun, I met some wonderful people but I want to be home working towards a long term goal. I am sure all of you can relate.   Did everyone enjoy the link from yesterday?  Well, today's the link is a little more left field.  I think this website is just awesome! Virtually Lost dot Net. I stumbled on it and thought it was appropriate for most of us.  You can choose your own path on this website and the quotes are really incredible. Check it out.  You will like it for sure.  Not coming into Austin this weekend but probably the following weekend depending on school schedule. Will catch up with everyone soon. I would love to have an ECI happy hour sometime soon. Maybe next week or something? I will send an email and help organize.   happy hump day.

      Hey, hey everyone.  Happy Monday - err, Tuesday?  I am so confused on the day of the week.  This is just a really strange day.  On Sunday, I was thinking it was Saturday all day long. Hump!  I had an excellent weekend. Enjoyed spending some good quality time with friends on Saturday night and then just hangin with Jen for the remainder of the weekend. We didn't do much and it was great. We had a nice quiet walk around the neighborhood on 4th of July to watch the fireworks and see if anyone was blowing their house up. No such luck. Hahaha.   I drove 18 hours yesterday (okay, okay, I am exagerating, but it felt like it) - I would like to call it, The Tour de Texas. Austin to Nacogodoches to Apple Springs to Houston. Starting at 11:30AM. Ughh, it was pain and a long story but I got what I needed and that's all that matters. I got registered for my summer classes this morning and that felt great. On the path for success. Hahaha, how gay. I am really excited though - classes start on Thursday.  Soooooooooooo..... Salvador, Canto de Brasil  Today's link is a great website to learn more about Salvador.  It's completely interactive but you need sound & flash - so check it out if you have it. It's such a great story of the people and some wonderful shots of the ocean and of the cities.  And of course if that doesn't interest you (which I can't imagine that it wouldn't), then this is kind of fun to play around with for a little while.    http://www.zefrank.com/scribbler/     Have a wonderful monday/tuesday/saturday/sunday - whatever day it is. (:0)

      I have definitely stooped to a brand new all time low - I can't stop looking for dirt on Britney Spears. I actually found a website today that spies on her! Shouldn't I be assamed of playing into this drama??? Now, I can't wait to get off work and go buy the new people with her interview about "the engagement".  Ugh, I am disgusting myself. Who really cares if she's engaged or pregnant or having knee surgery? Does she pay my bills? No. Nope. I am just some psycho voyerist or something. Hahaha. Oh, pathetic, I am, absolutely pathetic. Nonetheless, I have provided you with the link just incase you want to make yourself crazy with these antics.   We are FINALLY having some sunshine today in Houston, TX. Yippee. I guess it's only 11:43AM though, so I can't imagine it not starting up this afternoon.  I thought I would share another interesting link with you (this one a lot more interesting) that my mother told me about.  http://www.drudgereport.com/. Don't know if you have accessed it before (more than likely, Lisa knows exactly what I am talking about) but it's really interesting. Just a gossip column that may actually hold some substance. ??? Nonetheless, you can all see I have been working EXTREMELY hard at my new job. Hahaha.  Okay, have a wonderful Thursday! I am off for sushi!

      Hey everyone. Hope you had a nice weekend. Mine, was, well, okay. I got back from Austin on Saturday night and went to dinner with the family. That was fun. We ate at the Houston's Chuys which was weird. I am used to Austin's Chuys. It was fun though. My stepbrother and his girlfriend are nutz, I swear. They just crack me. We wound up sitting in the living for about two hours talking about random crap after dinner. They never seem to shock me with all of their weird questions. -another story-  Hmm, nothing much is new. Same 'ole same 'ole, I guess. I went to church yesterday which was nice. Had my little come to Jesus meetin' and that seemed to straighten a few things out in my head (always does). It was a small Methodist church close by my house in Houston. Don't think I will go back to that church but it definitely served it's purpose for me yesterday.  I am going to visit my grandmother this weekend (on Thursday) and I am very much looking forward to that. Just to spend a few days in the country with an out-of-range cellphone and no nonsense is going to be wonderful in general. I am hoping to spend some time eating blackberries and visiting with my little cousins as well.   I should run - must study! Big test (#2) on Thursday! Lots of love.
