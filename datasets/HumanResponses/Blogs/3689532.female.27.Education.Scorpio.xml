      Well, I went to see it last night. Was it the perfect movie in so much as it covered both sides in a fair manner? No. However, what the movie did bring up and the idea that if even 10% of it is true- then my God, things are a zillion times worse than I thought they were. There were parts of the movie that were so moving that I actually cried in a profound, tears streaming down my face sort of way. I think seeing the footage of war - the real nitty gritty- our troops being burnt to a crisp and then hit with baseball bats has changed me for life. I support our troops, I do not support this war and there is a profound difference in that. The points that Moore makes about how the poor of this country are the first to go over and defend us (recruiters preying on poor neighborhoods for militia men) hit me as one of the most horrible things we as a nation allow. Watching families lose their sons, for oil sickens me. I don't know if John Kerry is the best answer to lead America, what I do know is that the current administration must be removed. We as Americans have a responsbility to elect someone who can restore our credibility to the world. Perhaps I am naieve, too left, a flower child- perhaps living with a Hippie uncle has slanted me- I am Catholic, and pro-life but I can not allow myself to be a single issue voter. The footage of our troops in Iraq has changed my life. I realize that there is another side to the efforts over there, that there are Iraquis who support us and we are building schools, and expanding the country in a "democratic" way- but at what cost? Our own profits... our own greed...is the American way the only way to live? We choose our country but I don't know if we should be thrusting our way of life onto other nations... I don't know if we necessarily have it all right -the moral decay, the violence, the lack of family values- I don't know if we are the perfect way to live. I feel more and more like our quest to bring "democracy to the world" is more like a Crusade...everyone has the choice of how they want to live their life- our arrogance scares me, I am asking all of you to go see this film- take the time to think about these issues. Our generation is going to be left with many things to tackle and we as a well educated group of women has a responsibility to have an opinion and work for a better world. We have been given so much- of who much is given, much is expected. Vote. Read. Have debates. Remember what it is to be American, but remember that in the scheme of the world, we are a young nation and perhaps there are things that when we step away from it all we can learn from- remember what we looked like before Vietnam and the 60s... remember how one event can change the course of a nation's history. Ok, I am done- I have spouted off for entirely too long and the American Studies major in me can't help herself... but I wanted to share these thoughts with you, since right now I am longing for an academic environment where topics like these can be challenged... See this movie. When you walk out you may hate it or love it but you should see it either way because it makes you think, and how often these days does entertainment do that?

      Well I just got done my very first flea market experience- I came home $100 richer...as they say, one person's trash is another's treasure- however I could see me getting hooked on this - you just sell stuff and make money- sure beats going to a job you hate... I think I have the entrepenurial (sp???) spirit, and just don't have the capital to start it off... this could be a big day for me.  I am going to see 911 tonight with Uncle John- no doubt he is fired up about it. I will blog my thoughts after its over. As my friend Dan said last night- this election is going to be decided by the midwesterners...and he's right...that's what it comes down to...too bad I'm not an Indiana resident so my vote would really count.  Happy Saturday Bloggers.

      hello! just got back to work after a nice vacation. yeah-i had to sacrifice my friday because it is end of the year and no one else in the office knows what to do. Kind of powerful but kind of sucky too. I can not wait to see what happens when I am on maternity. So-it's 65 degrees out here-any other time i would complain-however, being 32 weeks or so pregnant-i kind of enjoy this cool weather. later skater

      Hey all!  Sounds like a good idea!  At least with this blogger thing I don't have to remember to put in everyone's email addresses! My one big thrill these days is that I get to drink alcohol again!!!  Now that I've finished breastfeeding Anna, I can drink myself silly.  Of course, one glass of wine and I'm asleep, so I have to work on that tolerance thing. Anyway, Mara, about these politics.  If Bush is re-elected, I think I'll bury my head in the sand and pray that the country is still here in 4 more years.  And yes, Kerry, is a true politician, but he has at least these things going for him (in my mind): his wife, Teresa, is never afraid to speak her mind, will stand up for what she believes in, and will tell him what she thinks whether he likes it or not, and may have sway over him.  Also, he actually has a brain and uses it.  I'd rather have a President be able to see both sides of an issue and wrestle with a decision, than not have a clue and not care what impact his decision makes on people.  I also have a problem with a President who believes that his religion makes him right.  Bush wears his faith on his sleeve, Kerry keeps his faith to himself.   Because my faith is a more personal, private part of myself, I tend to leen towards Kerry on this issue.  Kerry may be the lesser of two evils, but at least he doesn't believe he's always right because God told him he is.  Good quote I read the other day in Time magazine...."It's the difference between praying that you're right and believing that prayer makes you right."  In my opinion, prayer makes no one right.  Prayer is your personal conversation with your God.  Whether you share that with anyone else is your decision, but it's never a mandate. Now that I've offended everyone else, I'll get off my soapbox of religion and politics. I'm actually at my Mom's getting help with the kids.  Anna's taking a nap and Connor's whining to my Mom about taking a nap.  Kurt's finishing up his intern year as I type.  Alleluia, I get my husband back for the year!! Anna's gaining weight nicely these days, Connor's growing up before my eyes, and I'm enjoying summer.  I truly think I'm going to be one of those people that retire to a warm place...I'm becoming more and more intolerant of these cold winters! Welp, nothing like posting a long train of thought msg...... I hope this blogger thing catches on with us....might be nice!

      hey all.. well i hope more people join cause this sounds like it has the potential to be really cool :) It's hard to keep in touch and this sounds like its easy enough to do especially if we see something interesting and want to know people's reaction to it....like for example - does ANYONE know what is going on with these elections. Honestly (and I don't hope to offend) I would never vote for Bush (even if I could but I can't - 4 million American citizens not voting for a prez, but we can still go to war...)...anyway is Kerry much different??? I mean same school, same society...granted he did actually SERVE instead of playing around in the guard.   Regardless I feel disconnected so please inform me!!!!!

      Hi everyone- I am not sure how many of you know about these blog sites- they are all the rage in today's world (one of the benefits of working with today's youth... I know the trends...well sometimes). It's my hope that this blog will really take off for us- that we come here, post our thoughts on whats going on in the world and relive the days of the hallway conversations. I've seen examples of them among other college groups of friends and once they get going they can be a pretty awesome resource- because you can talk about things that maybe we don't cover in the group emails like our thoughts on current culture, events, etc... Welcome to the 4th Floor and Friends Blog....Blog away and enjoy :)

      i feel so cool now. i was watching the o'reilly factor-gotta love him and his "no spin zone"-and he mentioned blogs-and now i know what it means.  its 72 degrees here, 85% humidity and its a saturday-guess where I am-yeah work. I had weds/thurs/fri off this week after working my 9 straight days and now I am back for another weekend. i guess i have to put my "dues" in before my leave.   I have a new niece-her name is Emma Jean and she was born Thursday, July 8th at 630pm. She and mom are doing well and Julie has nicknamed her "baby cicada" which I think is very very cute. They tell me she looks a lot like Julie did when she was born so I have a good visual. I will get to meet her sometime this fall.   Later!!
