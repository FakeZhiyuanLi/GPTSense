      Excuse my nasty english and try to follow my idea :  This is my first post, Many religions are made, fighting against each others with their laws, and evidences, and since thoses evidences are makings thoses fights, i am just trying to create my own law about god without miracle or sign of god.  We are all trying to give a goal to our life, by saying our life got a goal, or the opposite : our life got no goal. We serve god, we serve ourselves, we serve something else, we are just part of something or we are part of nothing.  Something is not new : we are human, it looks like that we think (even the ones we think do not think), we have a human body made mostly of what is so called water. We made what we call art, sciences, sports, sensitivity; we can go mad, happy or have no or "different" feelings. We match with other sometimes, and some other times we do not match at all. We feel things that other people dont feel. They feel things that we dont feel sometimes, and sometimes we all agree on our feelings.  We are on earth, this land (they call it a planet), with vegetals, animals, and things we make on it : things made of existings things. We interacte on existings things to make other things : usefull things, different things.  From what we can see, our earth is in the universe, made of other planets, stars, and many particles/atoms/(whatever smaller) objects, even light is something. And from our thinking, even "empty" is something since we call it.  Our own world turn around us, because we think about it , we study it and we write about it. From animals (the other live specy with intelligence), we learn things and can teach them things.  Even god is made by our thinking : no human means no intelligence here at least enough to tell about god, ritual things etc..  Since god is something totally more important than us, managing the universe, and everything including us : it has the right to do anything to us (not only destroying and creating, but more exactly managing).  If of course we think that god only manage us, by doing any of our acts, god makes us alive, and what we thing is good is what to do? Then we arrive to the question of what is good and what is bad. For somes killing is bad, for others killing is good. Of course statistically more people are thinking that killing is bad even with people thinking that killing is good. All this makes our world and universe from what we know and sense  in a balance. Everything do so hopefully, or is the universe going to an end?  Oops, i said that everything is made because we think about it. So if we diseapears, that means that the universe wont exist anymore for us, we wont be able to prove it even if there is high probability that even if all the human were deads, the universe would continue to exist.  Then we have to go to hypothesis and laws : does god exists with the human and without the human specie ?  - YES , god exists without the human specie. - NO, god wouldnt exist without the human specie.  But the law here would be more exactly :  God would continue to exist even if the human specie wasnt existing anymore, only god seen by humans would not exist.  Romans, Antic Egyptians and Antic Greeks people had gods, they stopped to exists for them when they diseapeared, but after muslims, christians and other major religious human people found a god, strangely lately muslims christians and jewishs god their god from approx. the same origin even if technically they think they are all different.  Mainly, we says god did this, god did that, god didnt do this, didnt do that, or that we cannot understand what god is doing. Which means that we link (or not) god to our actions, thinking, feelings and history : Destiny, no Destiny is our main question - The exact question is are we able to understand the concept of god, and will we be able to give an answer to this kind of question.  Another kind of question still impossible to understand for the human specie : god, existance, all is made because we die. Do we still continue to exist somehow  after death, the eternal question without any real happy answer. After death somehow the particles that make us is still in activity even if our global conception is totally different and there is a probability that mainly not able to think anymore, or not to think in the way we are actually thinking when in the state alive.  So the human specie us, have our god made by our thinkings from what we think acting on our lives and managing everything including us : managing in detail or not, we dont know, since we can agree that the particles making us comes from some kind of creation of particles., this somewhere/somekind could be god. We in our actual potential no possibility to act on our own things when its not possible : time, life and death. It looks like somehow that time and particles would be included in my first law.  Then from this , my first law would be easy :  " Particles  are made from the  Creation ."  And then the second law would be :  " Human specie  is a group  mind states  of the  Particles Creation ."  To finish this first entry :  " Particles Creation  is an  Act of God ."  ---  Feel free to comment and wait for my next post!
