      yesterday (sunday) was awesome! synopsis; woke up at the crack of noon, earlier than i have in a while. went to cedar rose to reserve "seats" for the mime troupe show at 1 kelly shows up about 10 minutes later, we wait eventually we gather the following crowd: me, kelly, brittany, emily voitek, erika, dav, john, lizzy. brad fails to show, the bastard. john and dav had taken a detour to SF looking for the show. rather amusing. got back in plenty of time tho. saw the show, not brilliant but good. then...took everybody but lizzy who needed to go home to telegraph avenue, where we met josie at zebra's.  heres the rundown of the damage: brittany- a second set of holes, erika- pierced ears, me- a third hole (left ear) signed up, got a number, picked out the studs, spent lotsa money, etc. waited in zebra for awhile, took in the sights (lotsa body jewelry of all kinds, pornographic bumper stickers, etc) dav and john went to get food. soon afterwards they called our number and the 3 of us, w/ josie for moral support, went into teh "piercing room", a bamboo covered room way in the back. there was this formidable leather chair that belonged in either a medieval dungeon or a doctors office. brittany went first, very calm about it. then erika, winced a bit. then me, contorted myself in silent scream but it wasnt so bad. the dude was very nice, made conversation, used large ass needle. erika and i exited, there wa a puddle of something on the floor. turns out brittany left the room feeling sick and threw up. the cashier was very nice about it, said it was fine etc, we figured that kinda thing happened a lot. ear smarting, we exited. ppl went separate ways, kelly home, josie home i guess, brittany and emily to brittany's to get her some clothes. john and dav and me and erika retired to la vals pizza, a dark basement bar style place, to play pool. boys vs girls. john was pretty good, teh rest of us sucked. lotsa laughs tho. left, boys went to dav's, erika caught the bus, i had to get to a flute thing. wandered around berkeley on foot, actually did go the shortest possible route there, go molly. that was boring tho. got a ride w/ a nice father of one of the girls.  nobody home, the place was dark but of course my bro hadnt locked the door. took the dog out, he SPRINTED. mom came home, gave me an actors equitity pin (yay!) and thats about it. sorry that wasnt interesting i just wanted it recorded. luv you, whoever you are.

      Best song lyrics: Where is Philip, where is he? There he is, and he bleeds There's a blood stained tableclothe on him, Knives and forks all stuck in him There's a knife, there's a fork Oh Philip this is cruel work! What a terrible to-do Philip bleeds to death and turns blue. -From "Shockheaded Peter" (w/ apologies, I was just listening to that)

      ok this is roughly, um...2.5 minutes after I posted the first post, from here on in referred to in this document as "the party in the first behalf" or some such shit as that. I will call it "post #1" for short. well what's actually happening today is that I didn's get to the phone early enough to catch erika calling and she called me a butthead on the message she left me so now i feel bad and i miss her. i'm seeing farenheight 9/11 w/ laura dale, the beautiful etc, later on but of course it's a complicated rendez-vous cuz she's a dale. why gawd, why do i have friends such as the dales? oh yeah cuz i love them. i forgot. what kinda fucked up reason is that i ask you... seeing everybody on sunday though for some good old political satire compliments of the SF Mime Troupe. Very exciting because people are coming. and i got them to come. go molly. ok not really anything to say. cant figure out anyh ways to cheer up nico unless its going to ohio or whereever laura rose is and kidnapping the aforementioned laura and airmailing her to australia. but laura rose is notoriously tougher than me and it'd never work. ack. why doesnt anything come easy... ok already ive broken the promise to make this place 'funny'. i like the utter black-ness of the place, its very techie. and evil. oh wait the evil part was implied wasnt it? hey simpsons time! away i go.

      Ok so I feel a bit like a sell-out for creating one of these, but I've been thinking about it for awhile, really since Nico gave me the URL to hers and I started reading it, w/ frequency. Truthfully really maybe the reason why I started thinking about it is that I kept wanting to feel special and see my name up there in Nico's weblog, like I had done something in her life worth mentioning. So I've had a lot of free time this summer to think. Cuz I havent done shit. I keep thinking of cool things to say to people or to the entire world and wishing I had me one of these like Nico does (yes she is my inspiration) So now I've got one, and I will call it Squishy and it will be mine forever. Actually it looks like I'm calling it "Little Pieces of Genius Prose", which hopefully it will grow up to be. Most of the crazy things that get thought of in my head are really quite funny and now I vow to write them down like I never have before. I've thought up about a million ways to start this thing, things to say and stuff and the only one I really have always wanted to say is that I promise on my honor or lack thereof that I will try to make this funny as hell in september. Or possibly funnier. So my newest way to start this thing off, the metaphorical christening as it were, champagne bottle broken on teh hull of a new boat and whatnot, is to say 'Today is a good day to die'. Ok it sounded funnier in my head. Imagine James Bond saying it, Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnen not one of those fake blond fat James Bonds. Fine never mind. I'll probably not get the guts to send this URL to anybody till I've got about 20 entries already done. But hey thats life. If anybody save me ever reads this, well... Here's looking to you kid. Cheers.
