						   well well well...things are back in business around here it seems. i've started work, start summer school tomorrow, starting a new relationship, which is only in the pre-game jitters, voice lessons start in two weeks, and west side story should be starting soon as well. dreams were dark, but now are clear and vivid. i've taken on a new outlook upon life that is somewhat along the lines of buddhism. it's wonderful. well i'm off to work.

						   well, i'm awake. and i don't want to be. but i've been thinking...i have something great. i have something perfect. i don't want it to end, so i won't. i'll just take it easy, take it slow. like i planned originally.

						   the days seemingly get better as they go. i'm finally taking control of my feelings. being able to hold back but i'm ready to let all my feelings go. and i will. eventually.&nbsp; haha. when i'm ready. very good friends are always around the corner and when all else fails, my voice carries me through the sad times as well as my writings. but do understand that the sad times are arriving less and less often as the year has gone by. i've always been told to forget the past, but to forget the past is to ignore the present and let down the future.

						   I feel very good today. He will be home soon...after this last job. The thoughts that never cease to run through my head are quieter today and finally i am at peace once more. I have tried my best to avoid this, but i love him.&nbsp;There is a downside to this, however. My parents want me abstinent from relationships until I am 16. I say abstinent because i have been rather prominent in the dating world throughout the past two years. Now i must be single as a long-stemmed rose in a glass vase. So, I'll let him know the news when he arrives home in a week or two. He'll be tired and probably sleep for a few days at home before I see him, but i'll let him know. I won't defy my mother's rules. At all. So there's the end to it. And I'm okay with that.

						   relaxing... the ancient art of tai chi candles glow in the peaceful darkness the sweet aromas of brewing tea love in every heart beat pondering the proceeding act soft music echoing softly oh, it's so abstract  well i've taken up the new hobby of tai chi. it's so relaxing. i love it. just like i love him.  &nbsp;

						   Well here i am. at dance yesterday we learned some new moves and added them to our combos. they're really awesome. and the car wash was awesome as well. we had a lot of fun messing around. but it did take quite a toll on my poor feet and eyes. the balls of my feet feel like they got hit with a hammer numerous times. my eyes are just sunburned. i did get a major tan...it's almost a sunburn though. haha. the thing is, when i do get burned, it goes away in a two or three days and turns into a great looking tan. so i'm not worried. but yes, life has been trying lately, but once again like the catwoman i am, i managed to take care of myself. i have stepped into the sun and it's never felt so good. well actually it has because i didn't have this horrid pain in my feet or burning in my eyes, but passed the physical, the emotional&nbsp;part of me is soaring once more.

						   well the day has begun with a shower of pointless pleasure. so pleasurable, i now have a headache. it has never been so good, though, so i'm happy with the headache. my waist is now 25 inches and low abdomen is 28 inches. i'm almost to my goal, which is 24 and 27 inches. it's funny that everytime i reach my goal i am again unhappy with how i look. hopefully i'll be happy once i lose that inch. i really don't know though. i started at 27 1/2&nbsp;and 29 1/2. my goal was 26 and 28. i got there and then i lost around my waist more so i could have more shape to me. i am now happy with the shape of my waist but i want to lose more. i want to lose more in my thighs, too. my thighs used to touch all the way down to my knees, then i got it to half way down they touched, and now they touch probably a third the way down but i want them to barely touch when i stand with my feet together. so almost there. i always examine my body and i'm not sure it's healthy. everytime i change my clothes, before and after i work out, and before and after each shower. i just want my body to be perfect.

						   so i have been happy and enjoying life but in the last few days the light faded and the darkness has entered my heart once again. the funny thing is i don't even know why. summer school ended, voice class has been awesome, and we started dance rehearsals for west side story and our instructor compliments my technique often. everything should be perfect for me. but it's not. it's like the song by dashboard confessionals "saints and sailors" i feel like i've been cheated or lied to. but it's all a phase. i'll be happy for a while and then finally i'll start feeling that horrid feeling of betrayal, even when nothing is wrong. it's been like that since i first was cheated on two years ago. it doesn't end though. i go through weeks of being happy and then a&nbsp;couple weeks&nbsp;of being depressed. i'll be happy again soon.     This is where I say I've had enough and no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises and I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any Better. Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring and I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartmentis starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence. So don't be a liar, don't say that "everything's working" when everything's broken. And you smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor and your eyes say the joke's on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I’m not laughing, You’re not leaving, Who do I think, I am kidding? Wandering the house like I've never wanted out and this is about as social as I get now. And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you'cause they would never do, I would never do.   &nbsp;

						   i made a good decision today. and i'm glad i did but the temptation was hard to resist for a while. i'm okay though and i'm not going to fall into a bad track. temptation, no matter how hard to resist, if resisted, there is no harm done. but it's put a lot of doubt and guilt in my head.

						   I really, really need to stop feeling so horrible about myself. I decided whenever I feel bad about my body, I'll just head out somewhere or go to my garage to sing, dance or workout. That way, I'm busy. It's really funny, though. Whenever I feel bad about my body, I do the same thing I've done since last summer, even when I know it is wrong. I go and binge and then I feel worse so I drink a lot of water and I throw up and cry in the bathroom for a minute, then go on with my day like everything is fine. I'm going to stop. I stopped for a while, but I'm going to stop forever. I promised I would. I have to stop. It's just hard to sometimes. It's practically a habbit now, it's just not practical. He's going to be home on monday, and I'm really not doing well. He'll be disappointed.

						   i just went on a huge food frenzy and binged for the last two hours. i want to throw up so bad, but i've been doing so well...i haven't gotten sick in a while and i was eating regularly until today. i want to throw it up and start over, but i promised myself and my friends i wouldn't. but i want to. really. i'll be the first one to admit i have had a problem. and i know a few of my friends know. and my family knows. but my friends worry about me. i know i shouldn't do it...i just don't know

						   i'm sure i sound like a broken record by now. repeating the same ideas of love and life. i need new ideas. today i will be cleaning, and when i'm done, nick is coming over to learn the dances he missed from west side story.  i can't believe it's august already. i get sick of going to school every year towards the end. last year i got sick of it in the beginning of april. this year, i have a feeling it will be earlier because i had summer school. i have to find a relaxation in school so i won't get sick of it. i'll worry about that later in the school year though. i'm getting very angry with my computer. i have gotten three trojan horse viruses in the past week. i don't know how i'm getting them either. it's really bad because i can only get rid of them by getting rid of the file it is attached to. so far, they have only attacked temporary files, but if it gets to one of my program files or my microsoft files...there's going to be hell to pay by someone.
