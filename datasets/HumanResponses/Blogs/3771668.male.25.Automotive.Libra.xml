        For my Beloved Cat:  in the midst of the bustle, two souls collided. disregarding derision, two souls connected. the joy of empathy once found, soured when one refused to be bound. exquisite pleasure became exquisite pain, yet how a soul yearns for both again. how could the healing ever begin, above the deafening ache loss brings. understanding is lost, a bond goes awry. could it ever be restored before a soul dies? the allure of vast pecuniary gain, brings about a loss previously ordained. what is a heart that is being bled? a product of a liaison gone bad? arose from myriad snowballed events? or simply an organ that continues to rant? the anguish unbearable like the noonday sun. those who care matter not, save one.

       The weather is a little more accomodating than yesterday. The equator can be pretty unforgiving in terms of ambient temperature. Overcast clouds paint a depressing cast to an already drab sky. A brief respite from the heat, but definitely not an environment in which you would want to start every day in. Work is overwhelming, so much to do, yet direction is lacking. Caught a little of the Lee Kuan Yew interview yesterday night. His opinionated ribbing of Malays and the central government in Malaysia, and their racist, biased, treatment of Chinese and Indian citizens, won my sincere applause. Can't wait for tomorrow's first edition. Eager to see how far the issue can escalate for the press in Malaysia (no shred of journalistic integrity when the government is concerned) will probably be having a field day. Viva la equal rights.

       My very first blog posting. Feels weird somehow but could be due to the lack of sleep that i've been experiencing lately. I'm a business development manager for a manufacturer of Car bodykits called ARS. We've been exhibiting at the Singapore Expo Dreamcars Asia show since last Tuseday and haven't had a day off yet. The cars in the show were ok, the show was pretty biased towards performance tuning. Racing queens were great tho, chirpy, friendly and hot as red pokers, so if u gals are reading this, u kick mucho ass (will post some pix when i get to it) Writing this blog at work seems wrong somehow but I'm beyond caring. Slave driver of a boss had me working 14-15 hours since the bloody exhibition started :

       Just like that, life throws you a curve ball sometimes. Sad thing is it lands in your crotch. Life really sucks.

       I've oftened wondered as to why we pay such exorbitant prices for Brembo brake kits. Do their calipers offer something so extreme for them to be able to command such a premium? The same goes for struts manufactured by Tein, Koni or Kayaba. Defi Link BF meters would cost you a small fortune, and Sparco bucket seats often have extravagant price tags attached to their designer carbon-kevlar backsides. A GReddy turbo charger would set you back a couple of k. Do the performance of these performance parts really justify what the consumer actually forks out for them? Nevertheless, a plethora of logos on your door panel signifying the "existence" of such parts beneath the bonnet of your ride will gain you instant recognition as a force to be reckoned with. Do Nike Shox really make you jump higher, and add pizazz to your game? Does a diamond from Sookees assure you that you are as pretty as the fossilized piece of carbon that you, or some misbegotten sod, spent half a month's salary on? Does an Armani three piece insinuate that Donald Trump had better watch out? It's funny but unfortunately, I'm not immune either to such name brand envy. sigh.... Guess it's time to accumulate more loot for the meaningless accumulation of more loot.

       I'd like to apologize to my blog for the recent hiatus. It felt weird to pen thoughts when I'm depressed to no end. At this point in time, I'd like to pose a few rhetorical question. One feels deeply for another, yet knows that he or she is not perfect. Nevertheless, the other demands perfection. Can the process of attaining perfection be, in point of fact, possible? Could the other's desire for perfection denote a need for something just a little short of perfection, with all else being unacceptable? Is it possible for a person to emulate the sensitivity and pious characteristics of Saints like Mother Teresa and Francis Xavier? Is it possible to integrate such characteristics into the hustle and bustle of reality (being the constant rat race all of us are somehow involved in unless you are a bazillionaire)? Does the act of loving and caring for another in silent yet extreme distress mean much less than overt expressions of affection? Does thinking and yearning for someone every second of the day signify something not to be taken for granted? Does it indicate something so precious, and thus something to be treasured, like the golden fleece or does it entail that one should drink from the waters of lethe? Dammit my head hurts.

       Recently, I've made significant progress and clinched a few sizable deals. Most people would be extremely satisfied with fiduciary profit, but I'm hard pressed to tell all you loyal readers out there that the same applies to me. In truth, food lacks flavor, the air i breathe is rancid, and success in my career provides scant comfort. My relationship with the woman that I adore more than life itself, is tethering on the thinnest of threads. Let this be a lesson to you kids out there. Don't screw your relationship up, especially when you truly care for the other. Heed little warnings and admonitions otherwise one day, you'll be able to identify with yours truly (a fate that i wouldn't want to wish upon anybody else, except maybe the road bully that threatened to smash my head in with his steering lock some time back, but that's a story for another time). May the Lord bless all you good people out there.
