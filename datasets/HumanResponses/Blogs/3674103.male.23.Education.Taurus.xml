      any time i think of that idea, i have to say that the book 1984 always comes to mind. the country (or continent, i can't remember exactly) is always at war with either one of two other countries. at least, that's what the people are told by the government. as far as the average person is concerned, if her government tells her that they have to go to war to protect their country, there's a good chance she'll believe them. afterall, why would they lie about that?  that concept just gives me chills, since it is apparent that it is a concept that does not only exist in fiction. i think there are quite a few people who could argue that bush started a war to produce fear. i'm going to ignore the specifics of how, and discuss the why.  i would argue that practically all of society is based around some kind of fear. for example, fear of rejection which is based in all aspects of society; everything from consumerism, eating disorders, mental depression, materialism and i'm sure many others. another example is fear of the unknown. i don't mean ghosts however. i'm talking about everything going on in the world outside the borders of your country. this type of fear is based in patriotism, racism, stereotyping, as well as ignorance.  i would also argue that the worst example is fear of being afraid. this is, in my opinion, the underlining fear in america today (and, funny enough, in 1984 also). i mean, how else can a government have the majority of its people agree to a war which there is no reason to start, other than this concept mentioned. americans are afraid to be afraid. if bush attacks anyone who has even a remote chance of hurting them, then the masses will feel safer.  why would bush do this? well, if you want the people to agree to something they wouldn't ordinarilly agree to, make the situation unordinary. bush wants more control over prisoners, information, and civilians in america. the population disagreed because they didn't want to lose their basic freedoms. well screw freedom when terrorists are blowing up buildings around the corner. i'll let the government know what i do and where i am all the time, as long as i'm home in one piece. what are the chances of another terrorist attack in america? well, as far as the percentages go, 9/11 was the first time ever in a pretty long time, and now that the government has 'complete' control, everyone is safe and no one is safe.

      i'd just like to know, when is the exact time that talking to complete strangers became okay. when i was walking down the street in canada, people would not do that. when i was at the airport leaving to come to korea, i didn't see many people striking up conversations with the first person that walks by. on the plane here, no one spoke to me (other than the flight attendants and possibly the captain if that announcement counts). i got off the plane and set foot in korea, and suddenly every westerner on the street is my best friend.  i would, at one time, have thought this would be a good thing. i mean, everyone being nice and saying hello. now that it's a reality, i wish people would just shut up and leave me alone. i guess i'm somewhat flattered when a westerner turns around and follows me down the street just to ask me which school i work at. however, i feel a little more scared and afraid of this lonely, creepy person who's extremely desperate to speak to anyone who can understand him. i personally didn't come to korea expecting a busy social life, or one at all for that matter (it's obviously called the hermit nation for a reason).  to be honest, i thought i'd come here and meet some people that would be slightly similar to myself, and have the same reasons for being here. however, the vast majority of people i have met are purely insane (my opinion of course, not a clinical diagnosis). i'll save the breakdown of the people i meet here for a later posting.

      it's that time again. i'm currently in the middle of writing evaluations for my MANY students (somewhere over one hundred). i really don't mind writing them that much. i mean, i enjoy giving those horrible kids bad marks. it's just so satisfying. i'm more annoyed at the way they must be done. this time around, the school decided that actually writing on the paper was not the way to go. instead, we were told that we would have to type out our comments, print them, and glue them onto the paper. what the hell is that all about? i'd also like to see if the korean teachers will be doing the same. somehow, i doubt it.

      after experiencing korean businesses up close, i would be the first to argue that the vast majority of the time, the businessmen don't have a clue as to what would be best for the company. however, i would not be so judgmental as to argue that korean business men are more incompetent than canadian business men. the two are very different though.  one of the popular sayings that i know of in canadian business is 'location, location, location'. this is, obviously, pretty important for reasons such as: convenience, target consumers, population, competition etc. korean business, i am assuming i guess, does not feel the same about this point. there are, for example, multiple pharmacies in one neighbourhood (that is to say at least eight within ten minutes walking distance from my apartment). When one of these pharmacies closes (which they often do), another pharmacy soon opens in the same place.  another interesting point worth noting is the opening of a new business. i won't argue that every time a new business in canada is opened, there is always a very unique way of showing it. however, there are at least a few ways to advertise your opening day, such as signs, posters, sales, commercials, and possibly a (stupid) ribbon cutting ceremony of some kind. however, in korea, there is a very distinct way of displaying that your store is opening (or renewing itself (whatever that means), or celebrating an anniversary). the business hires two dancing girls (always two, bigger chains may hire more than two but that is only so they can take breaks while at least two of them can dance). these two girls stand on a small stage that is placed in front of the store, and they (lackadaisically) dance and sing. 9 times out of 10 there is a balloon arch as well.  i must say that i'd love to start my own english school in south korea, but i doubt it will ever happen (lack of money and a trustful korean to list a couple reasons). i wouldn't mind starting a small business in canada either. however, from my small amount of experience, the competition is much more fierce.

      as i write this, i'm sitting next to a student who is doing her listening tests on the computer. it wouldn't be that horrible listening to easy english stories as they fill in their answers (i've already heard so many by now that i have quite a few memorized), but the sad fact that the kids are allowed to listen to the stories as many times as they need drives me crazy. i mean, there are only so many times i can hear the sentence, 'the car is moving' before i turn around and scream at the kid for playing it another time.  on another note, i happen to read an article about this organization called moving america forward (or america moving forward or something along those lines). this 'grassroots' organization (and i use the term grassroots loosely since i have reasons to believe it's just a front) is actually trying to censor michael moore's new movie. it seriously upset me enough to join their message group just so i could post and ask them what the hell they think they are doing. i'll spare you the entire rant, but it had something to do with america being a democracy and the people having a right to question authority and government, otherwise it would be, what, fascism? i also considered the opposite view. does anyone think that if a movie came out that had a more neoconservative view, all the liberals in america would want to start organizations to censor it? i think we all know the obvious answer here.

      well here it is. my first blog post.  i'm really starting one just to give me something to do during my breaks at work. i just sit around and surf the net usually. at least now i can vent my frustrations online for a bit also.  i doubt anyone will be reading this anyway (since i probably won't tell anyone anyway), but just in case you are, stay tuned for many posts of south korea, politics, philosophy, religion and anything else i feel like rambling about.

      i have recently published a website onto the internet. it's mostly just my stories and poems and the like. nothing to fancy. i've been teaching myself html, css, and javascript lately just for fun. you can visit my site  urlLink here .   i'm also currently working on an online zine. i'm kind of short a few people though (considering it's only me and one other person as of right now). i figured i'd write the code for the site and get the shell finished, then work on the articles and recruiting later. hopefully some of my friends will help me. it won't be anything huge, though. i'm looking for about ten articles and publishing it every two months. i'm aiming to have the first edition by the beginning of september, but nothing is certain yet. i should have the actual site finished in a couple weeks or so, hopefully.

      a couple weeks ago, as i was trying to publish a post, i went to view my blog, and it wouldn't load. i tried to view my sister's blog and her's wouldn't load either. i figured that there must be something wrong with blogger and that's why the pages weren't loading. i also figured that there wasn't anything i could do, so i just waited.  today, i happen to find out some interesting news. it has recently come to my attention that the south korean government has blocked access to a few certain blog sites (this one included of course). their reason: some people had posted videos of the south korean that was beheaded in iraq. therefore, the entire blog site must be censored. for how long? i have no idea.  i haven't been posting that much since i was under the impression that no one could read my posts anyway. however, now that i know the truth, i'll continue to post even though i can't view them. i might as well try and fight the fascist regime from within.

      there's just something about being in another country for this long when you really don't plan on staying here for ever. my life pretty much feels like it's on hold while i'm here. yeah, i'm saving money towards my future goals, but other than that, i feel like i'm just trying to waste time. the weeks tend to go by fast (since i work six day work weeks), but i'm nearing my two year mark in korea (that's a cumulative amount obviously), and it feels like i've been here forever.  just the day to day rushing kills me. i'm so not the work all day every day person. my job is pretty easy, so i can handle it for a while, but i'm already starting to lose any and all motivation after five months. i can see my effort for my classes deteriorating. my students still work and learn (somewhat), but my laziness is definitely taking over. half the time, i don't prepare a game for the class any more. not that that is a huge problem. i've been around long enough that i can pretty much come up with something while i'm in class, but it still symbolizes my lack of effort.  i haven't been going out much (which might not be a shock to those of you who know me), but the difference is, i really don't want to do anything. maybe it's the summer heat, but i'd rather just sit and stare at the wall most of the time. sure, i go out on occasion. sometimes a friend or two will come to visit. usually i play video games, work on my web crap, or watch horrible television (which i hate even more here than i did in canada). i'm still waiting on my adbusters subscription to arrive so i'll have something to read ( the only book i brought with me was finished months ago).  hopefully the ends will justify the means for this endeavor. putting your life on hold for this long can definitely take it's toll on you.

      i'm all pissed off right now because i was working on making a web site to put all my photos from korea on (i'm doing this mostly because i've been using yahoo photos it is a piece of shit program, half the time it doesn't even load, most people i refer to that site email me back saying it doesn't work). anyway, i'm poor, so i was going to use the free geocities server for my photo site. however, today as i was working on it, i kept viewing the pages to check my changes. after about three views, it suddenly stopped working and said that i was over the limit of my data transfer. so pretty much i can view it twice a day and that's it.  care was telling me today that she'd like to start our own server service (does that make sense?), or at least use our own computer for our server. i wouldn't mind doing that, but it's a lot of work that i don't know much about.  so as of now, my photo site is scrapped, and my e-zine is on the shelf (since i think i'll need to actually pay for a domain name and the like before i start it). i need another project to keep me busy. i still have my original web site with my writing. i've updated it slightly, but nothing drastic. i think i might redo the entire site anyway. i can definitely make it better.

      okay, so some of you know that i used to work in a grocery store in the past. i was a cashier and that meant that i almost always had to bag the groceries for the customers (possibly the worst part of the job). everyone and their mother would complain. too many things in a bag, not enough, not separated properly (my personal pet peeve would be the people who stand and watch me bag everything myself and then when i'm finished, go ahead and change whatever items should be changed, i almost killed a few of those people). but i'm off topic. what i'm trying to say is, i have some sort of training and understanding of how the average grocery bag should be packed, and of course it's pretty obvious. heavy things on the bottom, light on the top, frozen separate, and pretty much put similar things in with each other. korea, in my opinion, has yet to master this basic understanding.  i seriously don't know what it is, but it is presumed that the less bags the better, and i don't mean three bags instead of four or five. i mean one bag instead of four or five (and you do pay for the bags, just in case you were thinking they are only trying to save money). in fact, i know people who have went to the store to buy multiple things, they have asked for more bags and the cashier has said no. i've had bags rip on the way home. i've had the handles cutting of circulation to my fingers while i carry them. this really has to stop. i mean, two or three bags is okay people.  care and i have a system down now. i carry the bag and she carries a couple of the heavier items (such as juices and the like) in her arms. it's not perfect, but at least i can make it home safely. come on, i'm paying for the bag. i'll even pay double. it's only five cents. just let me have another one.

      i really have to open a restaurant in this country. i would rack in the money. practically every restaurant is the same. let me explain.  first let's look at the traditional korean restaurant. these are usually smaller places with a few tables, but most people buy food to go or get it delivered. the sad part is, except for a few menu items (and i mean like two or three things max) they all make the same things. (i will stay away from the tangent that all korean food is more or less the same except for a different vegetable added since that can be saved for a separate post). so even though there are a large amount of korean restaurants (about five between my villa and the school), they are all the same.  second, the korean bakeries. i seriously don't know how these went so wrong. i remember working in fortino's supermarket for my part time job, and every morning the bakery would be making fresh bread. the smell was unbelievable and i'd find myself feeling so hungry just smelling it. in korea, when i walk by a bakery i feel ill. you have no idea how difficult it is to just buy a normal loaf of bread (especially whole wheat). everything has creams or vegetables or hotdogs (no joke) in them. maybe the cream filled breads would sound interesting, but trust me, they are horrible. they are not rich creamy creams like a danish or something like that (they don't have danishes here actually). a bakery with tasty pastries and breads here would make millions.  third, any other foreign food restaurants (this does not include 'western food' which is considered any fast food restaurant, they have those but i refuse to eat at them). there are hardly any around. there's the occasional italian restaurant with about three pastas to choose from. they're always crazy over-priced and never delicious. there are also random chinese and japanese restaurants, and they too are pretty sad. japanese restaurants pretty much only make 'don cas' which is a fried breaded pork thing, and that's it. chinese restaurants are crazy expensive (which is why i don't go often), and the food is always a korean adaptation of a chinese dish. that equals not delicious (however, a week ago a new chinese restaurant opened in this area and i have heard that it serves really chinese food, i have yet to try it though).  that's about it, except for the meat restaurants which serve either pork or beef and cook it in front of you. they are all the same as well. too bad i'm too poor to open my own place.

      i've decided that i really hate alcohol. maybe it just doesn't mix with me well. i really don't know. i like the idea of having a couple drinks to just relax from my crazy week, but i would much rather have other means of relaxation (which are not available in the super conservative country that is south korea).  i think it might have to do with the basic nature of alcohol. i mean, i choose to ingest this small amount of poison in order to slightly poison myself to feel happy and relaxed. at the same time, i'm hoping that my body will be able to dispel this poison before it makes me sick or kills me (while i bitch about the amount of times i have to piss when i drink also). it doesn't make much sense to me i guess.  however, i'll probably continue my weekend drinking (i've forced myself to drink only on the weekends due to some rough days at work which followed some crazy nights at the bars). i'll have my few beers (you can buy these re-sealable plastic pitchers of beer here, they are huge and great), or my gin and fanta (fanta, for those of you out of the loop, is kind of like an orange pop thing). maybe i'll eventually get someone to mail me some seeds or something.

      even after living in south korea for almost two years now, the normal notions and tendencies still amaze me. for example, there was a student in my class today who had a sun burn on his face. he had went to a theme park on the holiday and spent a little too much time in the sun walking around. now i can understand how that would be embarrassing for a child. i mean, imagine if that happened to you when you were in elementary school. i'm sure the children would laugh at you at least a little, but that's not the point here.  koreans are very sensitive about their skin. the reason is, well for lack of a better term, they're racist. if you were that child with a sun burn, i highly doubt you would have to listen to the same ridicule as here. comments such as "you are dirty" and "you are black" are the norm. in fact, even if a student of mine gets a normal sun tan (this is not restricted to burns), the students will say they look black and laugh at them.  also, the inter-racial couples are pretty much the same. hiddink (the white soccer coach for the korean national team) was engaged to a black woman, and that was big news here. again, this is not restricted to just famous couples. i've heard many a story about a foreigner and a korean walking down the street together and the passers-by making comments and the like. (however, for some reason a white male and a korean female is not considered very bad because a white male is considered to be rich and therefore a good choice for a korean woman).

      the following is a list of korean slogans/writings on various products in korea. these are, obviously, translated into english on the product. therefore, most of them are humorous due to their strange translation. others, even when translated properly, still don't make much sense. just sit back and enjoy.  the first part is the brand name and/or type of product, which is then followed by the slogan. (all slogans are written exactly as they are on the product. all punctuation and spelling errors included.)  1) Cosmos (serving tray): I like the strawberry. It puts the milk in the pretty strawberry and it eats and it is delicious more. I like the srtawberry. (strawberry was spelled incorrectly on the tray)  2) Cosmos (serving tray): So many butterflies are flowing around the garden where is fulled of beautiful flowers to announce the coming of spring.  3) Cosmos (plastic cup): The god create as the first flowers in the world The cosmos means the purity and love.  4) Pretty Bear (soap dish): With incredible magic of the pretty bear, you too will be the best friend like a lot of many people all over the world.  5) Chri Merry (garbage container): I was so happy when I knew that friend is very valuable mean.  6) Astro Boy (pencil case): ASTRO BOY who is pure and tender of heart and has a strong sense of justice, confronts his mighty foes in spite of his small body to aspire to a world robots and humans can be friends.  7) NoMore (pencil case): Fancy Friend Freeway.  8) La Niege (make up): Everyday new face.  9) (t-shirt): Money from chaos.  10) (national korean soccer team): Korea team fighting.  11) Nike (t-shirt): Let's get naked.  here are the new additions:  12) Blue Mong (pencil case): You share all my joy and sorrow...my other half.  13) Nunchy's Bakery (pencil case): Let me introduce my recipe food.  14) Blue Bear (pencil case): I wanna feel you in my arms again and you come to me...  15) Run! Run! Run! (pencil case): It is rabbit. You are not rabbit which come out in book! You can take the victory in game with turtle.  16) Pin Bear (pencil case): Get your wing. Pin Bear is made from brown solid fabric. He hasn't got anybody to play with.  that's all i have currently. i will probably add more when i see them. most of my students have pencil cases and clothes that have crazy things written on them. i'll probably repost this with updates eventually.

      oh my god. i was just fooling around on my blog site, trying to think of something to post today, and i just happened to click on the view blog tab. AND IT WORKED! it's seriously about time the korean government let us view this site again. man that is some crazy shit.  on an unrelated topic, i'm sick and tired of foreigners around me who treat this job like a real job. i guess if you are new to the country, you might think that you are actually here to teach, but spending any time here (or reading practically any message boards on the topic) you'd realize that your job is hollow. it just pains me to watch some other teachers working day in and day out on their lessons. this is not to say that i don't do work for my classes. on the contrary, i always have a lesson planned and i'm one of the few teachers that actually plays games based on the lesson i'm doing that day. however, i do not place all this value and worth into this job to make myself think that i'm really working and teaching. the children really don't learn anything. all they are taught here is to memorize and regirgitate. that's it. i sometimes can see improvements in my students, but most of the time they are dumb as posts.  also, you have to consider that the vast majority of people here do not have education degrees (and some with no degrees at all). it's not like they are educated to teach. so pretty much, a monkey could do this job. a complete idiot could do this job. idiots do get fired in korea on occasion, but i've seen a large amount of morons working here who don't do anything for their classes, and they have no problems.  all i'm saying is, for those of us that work here, please don't be beaming with pride at being an english teacher in south korea, because you're not a teacher, and your students don't learn english. you are the token minority member of the large company that has to pose in all the pictures with the boss. you are overpaid for your work. you are not treated as equals to the native teachers around you who have to actually try to teach and prove that they are trying to teach. you are for show. if you really want to work as hard as you can, and try to make the best impression, go ahead. just don't think you're something that you're not.

      ok. it's time to warn everyone about the killer umbrellas of south korea. this is no joke, and i'm dead serious. the following is very important for anyone who is considering coming here.  when it rains in korea (which it does often, especially in monsoon season), everyone and their mother has an umbrella. this in and of itself wouldn't be a huge problem. however, when you take into consideration the narrowness of the streets and sidewalks, as well as the behaviour of the average korean person (that is, personal space does not exist here), the outcome is the killer umbrella. i've been jabbed and poked. i've had to jump and dart out of the way. it's really only a matter of time until i get one in the eye and go blind. i've learned to fend off blows with my umbrella as well as see escape routes before a horrible umbrella stabbing can occur.  the worst part is yet to come. one might think that this situation can't be all that bad. i mean, how often can it really rain. it is usually sunny in korea, right? well, that is right. it is usually sunny and hot here. however, that is when the dreaded sun umbrellas show their ugly face. i swear to god if anyone i know buys a sun umbrella, i'll have to kill them on the spot. at least when it's raining i have my own umbrella to use for protection. when it's sunny out, i'm all vulnerable and open to the jagged umbrella tip.  another funny aspect of the sun umbrella is the accompanying "darth vader mask" which my fellow co-workers have labeled it as. this mask is part visor and part nuclear helmet. the brims tend to be huge and cover the entire face of the person wearing it. i personally have no idea why someone wearing one of these abomidable hats would ever need a sun umbrella, but i guess i'm just an outsider when it comes to south korean culture.

      so the workplace atmosphere has been on edge lately. i really don't want to get into specifics since i'll start ranting on for pages. let's just say there was a huge misunderstanding that has led to some teachers hating others, and now i feel like i'm walking on egg shells whenever i speak. for anyone who knows me, this is like the thing that i hate the most (more or less).  i thought i'd try to get the teachers to go out for a drink this wednesday night (we have a three day holiday coming up). the last time i tried to organize an outing, most of the foreign teachers came, all the secretaries, and only two out of ten korean teachers. the rest said that they are always busy on the weekends and that they can only come out during the week. although it is a holiday, and most people might be going away, i figured i'd try to get everyone out again. if they don't come this time, screw them.  on a totally different note, i'm really getting sick and tired of the racism here. i don't know why, but i've had no patience with it my second year. just today, as i'm walking to work, i stop at a crosswalk. there is a group of koreans standing with me, waiting (two women and four children). i'm pretty much minding my own business staring at the ground and/or the light, when suddenly out of the corner of my eye, i notice one of the women staring at me. i look up and see that the whole group is looking at me and (although my korean is shitty at best), i figure that they are trying to get the little boy to talk to me. one of the women were actually pulling his arm and gesturing to me. i guess when you look at it as one incident, it's really not that bad. but it happens all the time. it really makes me feel like a freak. "look mommy! look at the freak foreigner. he looks so scary!" "go talk to him, dear. let's see if all those hours of me forcing you to learn english are paying off." "no mommy, don't make me talk to him. he's scary. just look at him." i've just been gawked at a little too much lately, and i really might scream at the next person who does it.
