      Grrr!  I am at home today, having taken a vacation day in order to have my new Pergo floor installed.  How exciting, right???  It is unless the moisture in your concrete slab is too high :-(

      This reviewer was thrilled to have the privilege recently to attend the sole performance by Hedrick Middle School of Schoolhouse Rock, Jr.  I can't rave enough about the outstanding performance.    Wow! (interjection) It is clear to see that these young (adjective) thespians (noun) have worked hard and have had fun doing so.  Ranging in age from 11 to 14, these folks handled the pressure of live performance like many older, more seasoned actors must aspire to do.     We got a special treat in "Interplant Janet" when nine of the teachers as well as the school principal played the parts of the solar system.  The crowd loved it.  I mean, they ate it up!  Principal Taggert especially will always have a backup career on the stage should he ever tire of principaling.      For many of the parents watching, the show was a trip down memory lane.  During a few  songs, I could almost see the cartoon that went with the song in the TV version.  For you young readers, this was back when cartoons were pretty much a Saturday morning thing; lacking the 24/7 availability like it is now.  This means that we took our Saturday morning cartoons seriously.  Astute parents used this fact to their late-sleeping advantage.  As long as we kept quiet and didn't wake the parental units, we could have the ONLY TV IN THE HOUSE to ourselves for one glorious morning.  That glorious morning always included Schoolhouse Rock. Tonight's production took us back to that place.  Thank you and congratulations Ms. Hornsby on a job well done!  Kudos!  Of special note in the performance were Kelly Ferguson (chorus) Caitlin Doucet (chorus and dancer).  It was only by virtue of her smoldering, molasses voice that Ashley Johnson was even noticed by the crowd, so brightly did Kelly and Caitlin shine!

       urlLink Apple  I've got to say that Apple sure knows how to build a sexy website.  This is one of the very few sites that I visit simply because it is fun.  vw.com used to be in that category, but they sort of went from fun to yawn.  Funny, but that seems to have happened right about the same time that they added an SUV...

      As a computer programmer, of course my first posting must be titled "Hello World".    I created this partly from curiosity, but mostly because my teenage daughter has been pestering me to create one.  She created one on a site that does web journals only, but I, being the Google-geek that I am, had to use Google's.  Besides that, I use the Google toolbar anyway.  I am not sure what prompted the current Blog craze, but I have to think that it is a good thing.

       urlLink NPR : Hell Hath No Fury : "Hell Hath No Fury: Women's Letters From the End of the Affair "  I found this article while searching for the phrase "Hell Hath No Fury".  This article is about the best breakup letters.  I think that the author was doing this as a sort of catharsis.  The following was my personal favorite.  You go girl!  (Please note, this letter is rated PG-13 for language.  Please do not read further if words commonly considered curse words offend you, or if anger makes you uncomfortable).  It is said that you write the first draft with your heart, and edit with your head.  I think that this must be the (very angry) heart part...  You chicken-shit loser.  I have loved you absolutely for such an incredibly long time, with every cell in my body.  Even my fingertips have loved you.  I would have (and did) put your health and happiness before mine you selfish fuck.  You egocentric twit.  But now I wonder if I really ever loved you at all because, quite frankly, right now I hate you.  I mean the burning, pit of the stomach, head exploding, shake your fist in anger at God and the universe sort of hate.  I'm talking about the stuff that taints your vision and makes the bile rise in your throat.  I would almost call it all-consumining.  Fortunately, I am able to use the word "almost" in the previous sentence.  You fucked up and luckily didn't consume all of me.  The part that you didn't get is the part that will lead me out of this prison of a valley and into the sun.  And the bad part is, that you are so afraid of life, that it is a criminal shame to waste such a powerful emotion as hate on you.  I can't even conceive of wasting the greatest of emotions, love, on you at all.  Where was my head?  For that matter, was I paying attention to my heart?  Was I just so sunk in to a low self-esteem abyss while with you that I wouldn't see the sum of all of your parts (or lack thereof?).    As you know, I am fairly agnostic.  It isn't as if I don't wish that there was a great benevolent being looking over all of us; watching our backs.  That concept is so compelling that I think if there was no God that we the human race would have to invent it.  It is so compelling to me that I pray that there is a god looking out for us.  These days, I pray not only for benevolent, omnicient god (note: neither works without the other), but for a release of your memory.  As much wonderful, beautiful time as we have spent together, I would willingly trade it today to be free of all vestiges of your memory.  If you were to finally come back around, even tonight, I would al last have to say that it is just too late.  You can't expect me to wait for you forever.  I stole "Hell Hath No Fury" (and I have to say that I FINALLY understand that one) and will wrap this up with more stolen words.  "Frankly, [insert name of choice], I don't give a damn".
