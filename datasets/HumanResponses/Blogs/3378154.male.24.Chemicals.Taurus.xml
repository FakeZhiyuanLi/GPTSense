						   sunday night.  my only night off.  usually by now my house is swarmming with friends, friends of friends, and people who are just passing by.  tonight it is only me.  it's actually really nice.  i can listen to the music i want to hear and write in my blog without the remarks made by roommates.  i am really wierd.  i mentioned in an earlier post that when i am at the bar, regardless of how many people are speaking to me, i feel really lonely.  and here i am twelve thirty in the a.m.  alone in my house, but i don't feel lonely.  i feel fine.  july ninth my all time favorite band is coming to columbia.  zao.  and i can't wait.  it's going to be amazing.  i can't stop thinking that i should be doing something.  not tonight, but in a bigger sense of the word.  sometimes i look at people who are doing things to themselves that are obviously more painful than healthy, and i get really angry.  but then that is me, the pot, calling the kettle black, as they say.  i know what i have to do.  i am terrified.  i don't know how to do it, but it needs to be done.  the wind is blowing, and with the front door open it feels so great.  this moment.  good music, and comfort.  i would close my eyes and smile, but i cannot type so well, so i will be content to just smile.  soon.  it will be done.  soon.

						   she was there tonight.  i hadn't seen her since my birthday, three weeks ago.  i like that she tells people i am her best friend, and that she is a bad friend because she "neglects" me.  just between you and me, if she left me alone i'd be okay.  it's like she only comes around when she needs to let me know how "messed up" everything is for her.  then she tells me she'll probably be back tomorrow or the next day.  that's when i know i won't see her for a couple of weeks.  i guess she just needs her advice fix....someone to tell her all of the things she needs to hear so she can go home and be guilt-free for a few days.  on to other things....  i haven't been sleeping so well lately.  i think i have a disorder.  seven or eight times a night i wake up gasping because i haven't been breathing.  it's really scary.  then i don't sleep for very long.  i am afraid to take sleeping pills because what if i stop breathing and can't wake up.  oh well, bitch bitch bitch.  justin is moving out.  andrea is moving in.  i am going to miss him alot, but it will be nice living with someone who likes to be clean like me.

						   this morning when the sun rose up through my at around six or six thirty, i stuffed pillows in front of my window to block the light....waking up five hours later, i discovered there was no sun as it had been replaced with rain.  beautiful, beautiful rain.  you had to know that as "emo" as my posts are that i was going to love rain, right?  i mean read the title of this blogger account....cliche.

						   how do i go back?  i lost the innosence (sp) that kept me naive.  i can remember all the stages i went through, like some kind of fucked up twelve step program for blind faith.  now i am not blind, and the faith is gone.  my cup feels empty, and i feel tired.  all these thoughts...  i still defend it.  i am the last standing warrior defending a castle in ruins as a flood of barbarians and warmongers rush by me.  i still defend it.  where are you in all of this.  did i leave you?  i guess i must have.  "etched in Your hand."  so i ask again...how do i go back?  how do i erase what i have seen?  what i have read?  i have so many questions.  all of them boil down to the same...how do i go back?

						   i know all about the fact that it sounds cliche, but i feel alone.  it happened again tonight.  someone talking to me (as people do) about all of there problems and how shitty everything is for them.  the whole time, i am sitting there nodding, empathizing with them, my spirit is just screaming.  maybe it's my fault.  people ask me all of the time how i am doing, or if i am okay.  every now and then i tell them how i really feel instead of fine, and they sort of walk away scared.  it doesn't matter.  there is always something for me to complain about....i just feel so alone.

						   it's a really quiet night.  i can hear the crickets and the shaky whir of my fan and that's it.  very relaxing.  work almost ended stress free tonight, but at the last moment problems arose.  i really do not like confrontation, which is odd considering the line of work i have chosen for myself.  a photographer came by the bar today to take pictures for an article someone interviewed me for about religious tattoos.  of course, everyone in the bar had to fuck with me.  and in fairness, it does get a little obnoxious.  i am appreciative of the attention, but hardly a month goes by when i am not in the vox magazine. i have never had so much positive attention in my life, if i had, it certainly never lasted as long as this has.  local celebrity, they say.  why?  if they knew me, i mean KNEW me, they wouldn't give me a second glance.  i'm sure everyone has their skeletons, though.  i have a request.  we're all big boys and girls here, and i am ecstatic that you people take the time to read this drivel...but if you feel the need to comment, please post under some kind of name.  you know who i am, i deserve to know, or have some sort of clue who it is critiquing me.  i know who you are, but in case someone else decides to comment whithout a name this is for them.  anyway, that's it for tonight folks.  got shit to do tomorrow.  (she's back....)

						   Top secret time.&nbsp; my friend Pete (of Pete and Brandy) and myself are combining forces to bring to Columbia the hottest men....EVER.&nbsp; Six of us are making a calender that will parody "Suicide Girls," called "Suicide Boys: Nocturnally Emitted."&nbsp; It is a total joke, but it is going to be great.&nbsp; It will feature&nbsp;Pete, Gabe, Brian, Sean, Mikey, and i in various stages of undress.  The TV show has hit a lull.&nbsp; My partner is a great person, but he procrastinates like crazy.&nbsp; Not only that, but things keep going wrong, and it's really frustrating.  i need to get my pictures together and show them to Deb from Tellers so i can have my art show.&nbsp; (speaking of procrastination)  &nbsp; sleep....

						    "....(he) sat in his armchair, trying to allow himself to feel the loss, the pain, yet somehow he couldn't.  He could feel nothing, only a vague uncomfortable guilt at having no feelings."   That's from a short story by Irvine Welsh called "snuff," and i was lying in my bed reading it and it so deeply encompassed where i am, that i had to share it with someone.  Lucky you.   They say no man is an island, and i suppose it's true, there are "men" around me all of the time, but i am an emotional wasteland.   Completely incapable of feeling anything beyond physical hunger, exhaustion and self pity, which i refuse to acknowledge as a real emotion.  There is no point to this, no great conclusion, and as far as i can tell the story will end with all the loose threads remaining untied.
