      Who do people write blogs for? I am writing this because I want to be famous, I want people to care about my boring life.  Anyway, as promised last week, here are some of the comments written about me by other people I used to work with up until like last week. Here’s my favourite:  Jo writes: “Hey Ryan, has been lovely knowing you. I remember the first time I met you, I’d just started & everything was crazy. You came in gave a warm smile and shook my hand with both of yours. It was very sweet & made me feel so welcomed. Keep up the good work and enjoy your future Jo X.”  I always shake hands like that when I’m trying to hit on a woman. You shake hands normally with your right and sort of cup her hand using your left and right. I was really digging this until I saw the word “sweet.” I fucking hate it when women say you are sweet. It’s patronising. You women should say  it was very charming  instead of  it was very sweet.   Kristy writes: “Ryan, Of all the people here I think I’ll miss you the most! You’ve made my time here happy and you’ve put up with all my useless rambling. So I leave you with one more useless quote which I think applies to you: ‘Hard work never killed anybody, but why take a chance?’ You are by far the best existentialist I know and I think you could use the quote. Hopefully this is not goodbye. KEW”  That quote is so me. As for the existentialist part - sheesh. I hate being labelled an existentialist. It makes me sound so pretentious. Mind you, no one would label me as one if everytime I got drunk I didn’t go around telling everyone I was an existentialist just to get attention. I’ve got lots more to say about Kristy but that will have to wait for later. She’s the one who’s going overseas. Actually, I guess she’s left by now.  Fiona writes: “Hi Ryza, its fi, looks like no space for me. Much love tho. Enjoyed our time together much more than you know. Consider you to be a great friend. Lots of love. Fi.”  Its no coincidence all the quotes I’ve chosen to write here are all from women. I have this complex where I think every woman I know is in love with me. One day I hope to confess this theory to a woman and have her reply, “Yes, well, that’s because it’s probably true.” Not likely. Fi and I go way back. By “no space” she meant no space left to write on card. By “Enjoyed our time together much more than you know” I have no idea what she meant and have been unable to stop thinking about. I might discuss this next week. I might not.  Last but not least, evil she-bitch Sian writes: “Thanx for all your hard work. All the best Ryan. (undecipherable signature.)”  Well there’s a glowing endorsement. The card, which she purchased, has a picture of a guy with no hands and this caption:  Although Derek had lost his hands in an industrial accident, he was happy that no one could call him a wanker   I still have my hands. My boss is calling me a wanker. Yes I am a bitter, disgruntled, angry man. Who is now unemployed.

      I guess this is the part where I’m supposed to introduce myself, tell you what I like, what I am like, and other like-related things. But I’m not going to. I’m going to tell you about what happened to me today.  I quit my job this week. I’d been working for the same company for almost two years. I got this new boss a month ago who I don’t like. So I call her incompetent, get into trouble, blah blah blah. I finally got sick of her so I quit. Tonight was my office farewell party.  Actually no, it wasn’t, it was my friend’s office farewell party. I quit a week and a half ago.   Anyway, so tonight was a pretty low-key affair, pretty much because office moral is so low lately. Anyway, as we are leaving, my boss’ boyfriend says to me:  “Can I just give you some advice? With your next boss try not to make it so tough for her. She was just trying to come down from interstate and settle in and do a good job and you made it really difficult for her, you know. Blah blah blah”  I felt like smashing him. Only I wasn’t drunk enough, and he could probably take me sober. I wanted to say,  you’ve only heard half the story  or  don’t make judgements with things you don’t know all the facts on  or   you do realise your girlfriend is a total bitch and stupid as well don’t you  but I didn’t.  Anyway, tonight wasn’t supposed to be about that, I was supposed to be farewelling a good friend I won’t see in a while ‘cause she’s going overseas and I’ll miss her but right now all I can be is angry and pissed off and angry.  Stay tuned next week where I will read you the comments my co-workers wrote on my farewell card.
