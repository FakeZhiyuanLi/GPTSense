           Today is the last day of school.  Not for me...for my roommates.  It's a time of relief, of relaxation, of having them make lunch for me.  But it also means another thing:  the family is breaking up soon.  I have lived here in Crestview A8 for 1 year and 9 months.  It has been fantastic...even when Andy locked me out on the deck.  But now it's coming to an end.        "What end?" I often wonder.  We are all fairly uncertain of where we will all be and what we will be doing 3-4 months down the road.  So instead of worrying about all the details, I've decided to re-imagine what (most likely) will become of the Crestview A8 crew.  It goes a little something a-like-a this:      Dan will move to a studio apartment in West Hollywood.  No one knows exactly why he decided to go there of all places, but legend has it that Dan discovered a pot of gold (or maybe just pot) outside of Sunset.  He often throws parties in which most of his friends do most of the work for him, as he is now not only pretty, but very important.  His Enchanted Lighting did not do as well as expected.  However, he did do very well for himself by selling the world's oldest corndog (residence: freezer).  Now Dan enjoys driving a Testarosa (on his PS2 game) and watching his big screen HDTV (with PiP).        Izzy did end up moving to Long Beach, but he did not last at Light & Life Christian Fellowship very long.  Once he arrived, Izzy discovered his long lost dream of being Black.  He abandoned his post as Youth Pastor and took up a new role among the poor as the "Yoot Patta" on the streets of the LBC.  Cornrows and chitlins and all, Izzy has made quite a life for himself as the missionary of missionaries (not affiliated with TBN).  On one occasion, Izzy met his personal hero, Martin Lawrence, who gave him a word of wisdom that I cannot repeat because it contains too many expletives and references to body parts.  Izzy also successfully enterprised the "Anti-Tract" campaign that aims to get Evangelicals off the streets and into non-butthurt colleges where they can receive a real education.      Cory got married to Lyndsay after working at Calvin Crest.  They still own Kitty Two, who lives on the roof.  After Lyndsay got her teaching degree, they moved out of LA to an undisclosed location (some say in order to escape Izzy).  Cory, after long meditation and Lyndsay getting on his case, decided what he wanted to do with his life.  He took the $60 he earned at Calvin Crest and invested in Google.  Unfortunately, Google didn't do as well in the stock market as was hoped.  Cory took it pretty hard and blogged in vehement frustration afterward.  It so happened that one of the Google guys stumbled across this blog, took compassion on Cory and bought him a house in let's say....Scotland.  Cory then began working on a new project, a virtual classroom for Lyndsay's students where they could access books and resources outside of school.  Virtual Classroom caught on and made millions.  And Cory finally paid Travis back the $100 he owed him.      As for me, I did marry Shauna.  I wasn't happy for very long however, because I missed Kitty Two.  So I decided to make a new and improved Kitty Two out of the parts of my laptop.  It learned how to appropriately use the catbox, but it shut off at random intervals for a reason that has yet to be determined.  Eventually, I became burnt out with youth ministry and with the constant desire of Shauna in my mind, we moved to Greece.  Koine Greek wasn't exactly the most popular language of the area, I quickly discovered.  I then discovered my dream and began rebuilding the ancient city of Corinth, temple of Diana and all.  Unfortunately for me, the rapture did happen and swept Shauna away before I could finish my dream.  After losing the hottest girl alive, I fell into a deep depression and converted to Bahai.  I spent the rest of my life cleaning highways in Greece.        So there you have it.  Four roommates, four stories.  These guys have changed my life and I will never forget the moments I've had to spend with them.  Even if our lives don't end up like the fairly probable predictions above, I hope they know that I love them and will miss them, especially evil Kitty Two.

           So I've been thinking about Google a lot. A LOT.  Too much, in fact. My roommate has gotten me obsessed with it, along with being a Blogger (that coniving bastard).  Anyway, Google has changed my life...like Extreme Makeover Home Edition.  Google has become the Prime Meridian of my life (meaning that it points north and south).      But is Google really the company of tomorrow? Yes, yes it is. Yahoo and AOL and Lycos (what the hell happened to Lycos?) are all gone forever. Except for the first two.  But do you know what is here to stay? Booble.  That's right, Booble. Say it again. Booble. Didn't that feel good?  Booble is Google's ugly red-headed cousin that looks up pornographic websites.  And it's fun to say.  Booble.  Is this world really a better place by having a search engine dedicated to the porn industry?  Probably for people who like porn.  But for the rest of us, no.  It may be fun to say (Booble), but it takes away my joy.  If I really want to look for sexual things, I should get on my knees and pray for deliverance.  Whoever thought that pornography could do anyone any good?  Stupid Hugh Hefner.        That brings me to my final point:  What about Godle? OR Repentle? Or Hymnal?  Do we really need more sites that compete with Google for gross things such as boobs? Probably not.  Instead, we should pray for those crazy people who came up with Booble and stop judging them like I've been doing.  Booble.

      I was reading through Howard Zinn's book "A People's History of the United States" today and came to chapter 5 about the American Revolution.  As I was browsing the pages, I noticed Zinn talked extensively about the drafting of the U.S. Constitution.  He stated that the Founding Fathers did not actually want equality ("all men are created equal"), but used the Constitution to perpetuate their already wealthy ideals.  Zinn writes:  "Were the Founding Fathers wise and just men trying to achieve a good balance?  In fact, they did not want a balance, except one which kept things as they were, a balance among the dominant forces at that time.  They certainly did not want an equal balance between slaves and masters, propertyless and property holders, Indians and whites." (pg. 101).    I guess I never really thought about the Constitution this way.  But then it sort of made sense when I think of Christian docrtrine and how that has been treated over the last two-thousand years.  So many people want Jesus without having to follow him.  People want justice without standing up for the oppressed. People want salvation without remaining in the Savior.  I admit that I myself am guilty of this as well.  Sometimes even with the best intentions, people (me) curve ideas and principles toward their own benefit.  Today is Memorial Day. I have not thought of one soldier who gave his life for me and this country yet.  Instead, I've enjoyed a nice day off.    A couple of weeks ago I talked about encountering a homeless man who asked for money to buy beer with it. I said that even though I felt like I should have done something for this man, I did not. Last night Izzy gave an amazing talk on God's compassion for the poor.  Cory has been hanging out with homeless people all week.  It's time for some action.    When I start to imagine all the injustice in the world and look at myself, I see little that can be done. But you know what? I'm wrong. I can change this world by hanging out with one of my high school students for an hour. I can change the world by hanging out with alzheimer's patients for a day.  I can change the world by sharpening my mind and turning that knowledge into action.  There is a boy in Tanzania named Jamali. He's 9. He works harder than I do. He draws pictures of cars and soccer players and flags better than I can.  I send him $28 a month, which I believe to be nothing.  He writes me often to inform me how much he thinks about me and how my sponsorship has changed his life.  His birthday is coming up this month. I don't have much money in my account. But that doesn't matter. This kid is amazing and he deserves to be loved. Why? Because I'd feel guilty? No. Because God Almighty made him in His image and when He makes things, He makes them very good.

      So the other day I take some of my high school students to this Center for Alzheimer's Patients. It was so crazy! The first lady I walked up to grabbed my arm and said, "I know you. You have this wit about you and you're always so funny." My first instinct was to think that she said this to everybody.  But then again, maybe not.  She then told me about her cat, her home in Montana, how I reminded her of 8 different people, and how I am going to be a great minister (I don't know where she got that from either). Then, we all got in a circle and hit a balloon around in the air, trying not to let it touch the ground. These old people were loving it...and so were my high school students. Sometimes it's unimaginable how you go to do "ministry" to someone and they end up ministering to you.

      As I was driving home from Pasadena today, I saw a homeless dude standing on a street corner. He held up a sign that read, "Why lie? I need a cold beer." My first instinct was to smirk. "Clever," I thought. Then I wondered if this ploy of his actually worked. "If I were him, I would just say how poor I was" popped into my head.  But regardless of what his sign read or might have read, I drove on by.    It's funny how God works sometimes. One minute I'm driving past a homeless person, doing nothing. The next minute I'm study the Gospel of Luke for a paper, all the time aware of Luke's narrative to love the poor. I find it's been easy to make excuses such as, "I don't have time before the light changes" or "I'm poor myself". When I'm struggling to make loan payments and my pastors at church refuse to minister to me because youth ministry isn't real ministry, it becomes easy to become desensitized to the struggles of others. Or more succinctly, it's easier to forget what I'm here for.   I'm sure that I'd like to say that as soon as this blog is done, I'm going to empty my already empty wallet by giving to the poor or spend my time working in a soup kitchen. The truth is I probably won't do either of those things...not because I don't want to, but because I have other things to do, such as watch Smallville and buy things on Ebay. God, help me.

      So I have this girlfriend. Her name is Shauna, but I call her Banana. She's pretty rad. In fact, she's radder than me. Can you believe it? Me either! Time for a history lesson.  One day about two years ago, I saw this girl named Shauna at my church. I said to myself, "That's one FLY HONEY!" Dan didn't quite agree, but then again, no one ever likes Dan's opinions. So I said to myself, "Self, you must hook up with that girl!" Then I came up with a plan. The plan was to make up a story about a girl named "Babs" (I'm sure someone has that name in real life) who just broke my heart and use her as an excuse for the hot Shauna to comfort me. Although my story was fool-proof, she didn't buy it. I invited her to my house. Nothing. I invited her to my graduation. Never saw her.   I then went to Merced, counting my losses. But while there, I received a timely phone call from an old friend who inspired me to continue in my pursuit of the Blonde Bombshell that is the Sha. My next move: go back to LA. That's right, I moved BACK to APU in order to resurrect any chances I may have with her. Step one: send an apology for the Babs incident. Step two: have a common friend bring her over to my house unsuspectingly. Step three: let my magic work.   It didn't quite work out the way I expected, but for some odd reason, she actually began to like me! By the way, I owe God my life for that one. After a while I girded up my loins and asked her out. She said, "I think you're a great guy....and I like you too." What a relief. I almost crapped my pants during that pause there (as seen by the "....").  So now we've been going out for a year and a half and it's been wonderful.  How is life now? Wonderful. Every waking minute I think of that girl (even sleeping minutes). She's beautiful, she's funny, she's smart, she's athletic, she kicks my butt, and she's a trophy girl (to me, anyway). So WHY THE FRICK AREN'T WE MARRIED?!? I don't know! Tucson, if you're reading this, all I gotta say to you is HIRE ME NOW!!!!! 'Cause if you don't....

      Been listening to the news lately? Prisoners being stacked naked on top of each other. Americans getting their heads chopped off on TV. Tombstones desecrated. But what is at the forefront of the American media coverage? The Bachelor. Somehow I've gotten the feeling that we've gotten off track.  Some people say that the world is going to hell. Others (crazy liberals) think that the world will someday be one happy perfect place. You know what I think? No, of course you don't. So I will tell you. I think we should all watch Homestarrunner and drink Strawberries & Cream Frappucinos.   Rodney King once declared, "Why can't we all get along?" It was funny at the time, but it begins to make more and more sense after looking at how idiotic this world is (including myself). So world, get along. Because if you don't, someday, I will have Jedi powers and destroy you all.

      I remember reading the book "Farenheit 451" when I was in high school.  People were ostracized and killed because of their love of reading. Today Izzy ordered a book called "12 Caesars" which came recommended to him by several APU professors.  Yarchin, in a chapel speech, recently said one of the most important things you can do in your Christian life is read a lot of books and talk about them with your friends. Upon hearing this and talking to others about it, I've decided that that is something I need more in my life.   As far as I can remember, I have loved books, especially philosophical books that really make you think.  "Danny and the Dinosaur" by Syd Hoff quickly comes to mind.  "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is another intellectual classic.  I need books like these to read to stimulate my mind and sharpen my soul...but Harry Potter 6 isn't due out for another year or two.  So maybe I'll steal Izzy's books in the meantime.    Or maybe I'll write my own book.  It'll be about discovering a method to re-create dinosaurs and putting them in a theme park, but the dinosaurs take over and kill everyone...except for the killer robots from the planet Krypton!!!  Doesn't that sound like a thriller?  I think I'll call it, "Star Wars".    Wait, I've got another idea.  A rogue lawyer discovers some hidden truth and is pursued by hitmen, corrupt cops, and a guy driving an ice cream truck.  Also, all of the birds in the world also try to kill him and cover up his secret...by using twigs and leaves!  It shall be titled, "Tremors".    Who knows, it could happen, right?  Or maybe I should just leave the reading and creativity to Shauna.  She's a lot smarter than I am.   And people would probably be more interested in the preface she wrote for my book than in the book itself.  Oh well.  As long as I don't actually have to READ anything.

      As I sit in front of my computer donning only my plaid boxer shorts, I agonize over the fact that I have homework to do.  It's not a particularly hard or pressing assignment, but it is homework nonetheless.  Living with three other roommates often provides me with some outside perspective on school such as "It sucks," or "I'm ditching today," or "I was supposed to take a midterm?"  There have been times in my life in which I have really enjoyed attending classes and writing papers, like in Matt Rindge's class, for example.  But oh, the times have changed.  This apathetic mood I'm in is not just a reflection of my bitterness to doing things (like walking), but is becoming a trend in today's society (like post-modernism).  In light of this research (which I have just now calculated in my head), I have come to a conclusion:  BAN THE BOOKS!  Can you imagine a world without homework, without tests, without driving for half an hour to school in a car without air conditioning?  No stressing about turning papers in on time, no study groups, no more group projects (which no one has ever liked).  Wouldn't that be a wonderful place?   It can be achieved! If we join together and all decide to never do homework again or attend classes anymore, etc., we can bring down the MAN that is the university.  Just picture this in your head:  an entire college in which not a single person made any effort to work.  What would the professors do?  Is it possible to have a school full of failures? (Yes, hypothetically).  But what would colleges do if we stopped showing up and doing homework?  My opinion:  They'd go insane.  Crazy insane.  They'd think they had failed and would do anything to get us back so we can put their bumper stickers on our cars...even pay US!  The theoretical ball, my friend, is now in our court.  Think about it.

           I watched Band of Brothers for the fourth time through the other day.  If that movie does anything for me, it teaches me the value of war and the true heroism of those guys who went over there for the sake of freedom.  As a Christ follower, my initial reaction to war is opposition.  Personally, I think Jesus offers a better ethic than to kill people.  But Band of Brothers and movies such as Saving Private Ryan or Braveheart help me see that there is value in war (as weird as that sounds).  My intention here is not to discuss that idea, however.       Instead, I want to talk about old people.  They bug the heck out of me.  Always talking about how things were better back when and how us kids have ruined the world.  They sleep all day long and read newspapers and watch Matlock.  I can't relate to that.  I think the reason why that is is because I don't want to.  I'm unlike them.  Does generationalism (if that's a word) have to be an obstacle in my life?  No.  Band of Brothers features a group of old dudes who sit around talking about the war, about losses and victories, about freedom, and singing songs I've never heard.  More importantly, these old dudes showed me that everybody is valuable.  These crazy old dudes rocked Hitler's face so that this world would look differently.  I can't help but respect and honor that.  So today I'm feeling good about old folks....until I run into one.  I attended a Ministry Convention in Pasadena earlier today.  At the second seminar I was trying to attend, Jim Burns was speaking.  When I arrived at the meeting room, the previous teacher was still lecturing and myself, along with several others, had to wait outside.  Then the teacher finished and a multitude began leaving the premises.  There was only one door, however.  And as these people left, I decided to hold the door and let all the nice people exit.  But while this was happening, an older lady was trying to get in.  She was not satisfied to wait like the rest of us.  This lady even made comments to the outgoing people, indicating that they needed to get out of her way.         I reflected on this and was sorely disappointed.  Not even a whole day earlier I was excited about my new outlook towards the elderly.  In an instant my mind was reeling as Captain Grumpypants tried to shuffle her way into the auditorium.  After the session ended, I was reminded of something.  I've been talking about how we fail and don't get the point as Christ followers, yet he still loves us thoroughly and wants us to continue to follow him.  God then reminded me to apply that lesson to old people.  They have done great things for this country and for the world and for me personally, but they're not perfect and never will be.  As such, I need to honor and respect them, with the notion in the back of my mind that as cool as they are, even they need to grow up sometimes.

      So in 4 days, I will be going to Hong Kong! ( urlLink Welcome to DiscoverHongKong ). I will be going with 9 other people from church on a 3-week mission trip. We'll be doing all kinds of cool ministries such as buying stuff from the black market and eating dogs (just kidding). Should be exciting! When I get back, I will bring all 2 of you who read this something from Hong Kong (like Jackie Chan). The plane ride over is 12 hours! While in flight, I'm going to start a game of capture the flag. No hiding the flag (a barf bag) in the WC!

      Today Izzy and I went to the store. We saw a sweet open parking space only to discover that someone had left a shopping cart right in the middle. Izzy and Cory have both posted about this travesty, so check those out for yourselves. But as we were leaving the Ralph's parking lot, we followed an older woman out. The Ralph's exit had two lanes: one for turning left and one for turning right. The lady in front of us decided to go right in between the two. No turn signal, no wave of apology for a stupid move. Nothing.   Now I know that I am not the best driver in the world and have made my share of mistakes on the road, but I do believe I deserve my license. There are countless numbers of people, however, that should not be allowed to drive. These are the people who tailgate you for no reason. These are the people that start cleaning their windshields at 65mph in front of you, knowing that their wiper fluid was going to hit your car. These are the people that slow down to look at accidents. These are people who park in two spaces instead of one. These are people who drive too slow in the fast lane and who drive too fast in the slow lane. And don't get me started on those who violate the carpool lane.   America is known for its freedoms. People can do whatever the heck they want around here. It's great most of the time. But a freedom to drive when you do not have the appropriate mental and physical capacity to do so is insane. I'm not talking about handicapped people. They drive better than I do. I'm talking about people who should be perfectly capable of driving correctly but don't. So I've come up with a plan. First, drivers tests occur over the course of a year. That way the DMV proctor can get a better perspective on a person's driving habits. Second, certain laws need to be changed. People get tickets everyday for breaking laws that should not be in existence (such as "speeding" or "turning right"). Instead of these pointless laws, police should enforce what I like to call "idiot laws." If you want to know what qualifies as an idiot law, read the paragraph above. Third, execute the maximum penalty for thoughtless drivers. Take their licenses away for a month...or better yet...put them on a FOX reality tv show in which they all must live together for a month, driving around on a closed circuit with each other. If that doesn't teach them the error of their ways, I don't know what will. If you have any suggestions on what to do about this problem that is plaguing our great country, please TESTIFY it up.

      Cory ( urlLink Pi�aBlog || Cory Pi� ) went in to the hospital the other day to get his heart looked at. His insurance company got bored with movies and television and so they paid for a visit to the doctor to watch Cory's heart on a smaller tv screen.  I think he's doing okay (I should probably talk to him), but this whole thing made me start thinking about losing my best friend.  It's a little odd to do a tribute to somebody who is still very much alive and kicking, but the following is what I think people would say at my best friend Cory's funeral:  "Here lies Cory Allen Piña, III (or so he claimed)." (Travis Mundy)  "That guy sure owed me a lot of money!" (Most of Cory's friends)  "Remember yesterday?" (Sam Rizk)  "I'm gonna kill you!!!!" (upset water balloon guy Micah)  "What is that, weed?!?" (upset lady on Alvarado St.)  "What smells?" (Barb Piña)  "He was deliberate and intentional." (Scott Vance)  "Cory, what the fudge!!!" (Izzy Matos)  "He's the greatest guy ever!" (Lyndsay Kirk)  "He sure tried his hardest to follow me. He did a great job at it to." (Jesus)  "Meow!" (Kitty 2)  "You don't ever tell me" (Andy Irish)  "MMMMMMMM....beer!" (Homer Simpson)  "Come on guys, in Christ?" (Grace Faris)  "When you take the accusitive, masculine plural, you get what?" (Phil Faris)  "Cory always does everything before me!" (Travis Mundy)  That's all. Cory, I love you, homie. Get better! NOW!

      I love the 80's. My memories of the 1980's consist of G.I. Joes, T & C Surf Design, moving around the Pacific and the great years of Ronald Reagan. Unlike most people older than me, I do not remember the economic and military crises of that decade. Instead, I'm filled with warm ideas of Transformers and X-Men comics for 50 cents.   This weekend I went visited a church that reminded me of better times. It was a great place full of good people. The contemporary worship service was very contemporary for its location, but it was a throw backwards for this California boy. I don't typically pride myself for living in the entertainment capital of the world where everything is cutting edge, but as I have come to find out, it has shaped many of my perspectives. It was just somewhat odd to see a contemporary service that reached Boomers who grew best connect with the ideals of the 80's.   On a side note, I was reprimanded on Izzy's blog today ( urlLink main || izzy.yirah.com || izzy matos ). In his blog, "A Nation Divided Against Itself Will NOT Stand!!!", Izzy talked about the importance of supporting the leaders WE elected. He received some harsh response to this. Upon reading these responses, I was immediately infuriated and called the respondents "morons." I realize that this was not the appropriate feedback I could have left. In fact, I was convicted of it afterwards. However, even after I retracted my words I was met with criticism about my criticism. It seems to me that this is often my reaction to criticism, but I no longer think it is a valid one. And this is against my nature. So what do I do?  My answer: Remember the 80's. It's time we returned to sweatbands, He-Man, Top Gun, and the war on drugs. We need to live less in the confused world of today and make our exodus back to the great capitalist union of the Reagan administration. Remember the Goonies? Well this is my wish, my wish!

      In about 12 hours, I will be departing to Tucson, AZ ( urlLink City of Tucson ).  If you were driving, it would take you a little over 6 hours to get there.  My flight leaves at 8am tomorrow morning. I am required to check in an hour before my flight at 7am. Once I board the plane, I will take off NOT TO TUCSON, but to Las Vegas, NV ( urlLink The City of Las Vegas ). This is a 55 minute flight. Once there, I have a one hour lay-over, and then I jump on a plane to Tucson, which is an hour and twenty minute flight from Vegas. I will arrive at 11:20am in Tucson, AZ. This trip (all together) took up 4 hours and 20 minutes of time, and costs over $200. If I was actually paying for this trip myself, I would save approximately 2 hours of travel time, but pay $150 more.   I don't really have a problem with air travel. In fact, I love airplanes. I haven't been on an airplane for about 8 years, so this is kind of exciting. This is my "warmup" for Hong Kong ( urlLink Welcome to DiscoverHongKong ), which is a 14 hour flight (yay!). If you are saying to yourself, "Self, why is Travis going to Hong Kong?", I have a great answer for you. My church ( urlLink Grace Church of Glendora ) is sending myself and a team of my awesome high school students to Hong Kong for 3 weeks. While we are there, we are going to teach English, work alongside teenagers at local churches and empower them to do ministry, form some lasting small groups, participate in beach evangelism, and a whole lot more. The total cost for this trip is $3,000 a person. But I only need to raise $1,000 from sponsors. If you would like to sponsor me or anyone on my team, please click on the "Testify" button and let me know. If you do, I will bring you back a pair of chopsticks or a panda bear (fake OR real).

      Currently it is around 11:30pm Pacific Daylight Time on Tuesday, June 1st, 2004. I can't smile because a student elbowed me in the lip while playing basketball tonight. It bled a little. But now I look like Elvis with his lip all curled up. My legs are also very sore from hiking in Pasadena yesterday with Shauna.   But that's okay. Today I took my BMI (Body Mass Index) and discovered I am extremely "normal".  The BMI determines if you are at a healthy weight based on your height. The way this is done is by dividing your weight (in pounds) by your height (in inches) squared.  You then take that number and multiply it by 703.  This is your BMI. (Or go here:  urlLink Calculate your BMI - American BMI Calculator ) Example:  I weigh 130 lbs. and am 5'6" (66 inches).  66 squared is 4356.  So 130 divided by 4356 equals 0.02984... Take that and then multply it by 703.  This equals 20.98, my BMI.  A "normal" BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.  I'm smack dab in the middle of "normal". If your BMI is less than 18.5, you are underweight. If your BMI is above 24.9, you are overweight. If your BMI is above 30, you are obese. I also found out that I can go up to 155 pounds before I could be considered overweight. None of this matters to anybody, I'm sure, but I thought it was interesting.  So I'm normal, yet beaten up. Great. Again, it's okay. In a meeting today, our Hong Kong team talked about reactionary behavior in certain situations. Again, I took another test. I found out in this test that my most common reaction to something is the Aggresive Response. This means that I like to get my way, know what I want, and fight for what I believe. My second highest reaction was Considerate Response, in which I try to maintain balance and seek the best for both parties.   Here's what I learned today: I'm breakable and aggresive, but normal. Isn't that great? Answer: not really. It doesn't mean anything.

      In about an hour Izzy and I are going to see the movie  The Village  by M. Night Shyamalan (or something). It's about a village and some other things. I am very excited to go see it, especially because I like M. Night Whatever's other movies. But one thing I do not like about movies is how freaking expensive they are these days. I even recently heard that movie theaters charged so much (not only for the movie, but for food) because they barely make any money from the movie companies. So I have decided that I am only going to see movies that I REALLY REALLY have a desire to watch, such as Star Wars III and Clockstoppers 2 (if it ever comes out). Or better yet...instead of watching movies, why don't I make my own...  T. James Mundy's latest thriller:  The Commode  (now in theaters)!  What is  The Commode , you ask? Well let me tell you. It's the story of a lonely commode and his fight for survival against cancer, commode-haters, capitalism, zombies, Brittney Spears, evil archaelogists, music piracy and the common cold. Running Time: 36 minutes. Starring: Brittney Spears, Bill Gates, Harrison Ford and Orlando Bloom as the commode. Special guest appearance by Crocodile Dundee ("You call that a knife? This is a knife!").  The Commode  is a thrill ride that will take you out of your seat, place you gently back in it again and shake your hand after it is all over. The 36 minutes of raw action, comedy, drama, dramedy and documentary is well worth your $24. Buy your tickets now or else you'll have to get them later!!!  It could work, right? I just need to call George Lucas to hook me up with some blue screens. Or are they green screens? What does it matter? For those of you who loved  The Commode , stay tuned for my next work:  Weekend at Bernie's 3: Yep, He's Still Dead...and This Time, It's Personal!!!

      Okay, so I have arrived back in the good ol' U.S. of A. after 3 weeks of being in China. How was it, you ask? Fantastic. Simply stunning. First of all, let me say that I believe the people in Hong Kong do life right. There is more time spent talking and being cordial to one another than in America. Free health care for everyone. Public transportation without weirdos. Cheap taxis. Jackie Chan.   While my team and I were in Hong Kong, we participated with several missionaries and churches in various ministry settings.&nbsp;During Week One we were placed into "Adventures in English" groups with about 5 Chinese teenagers per group. Our job for the week was to complete various tasks throughout Hong Kong as we conversed with each other, learning each other's language...and also engage in ministry. And that we did. My group consisted of Kristin (American), Nick, Ray, Ming, Ding Ding and Dong Dong (yes, they prefer to be called that). They were a bunch of characters. In particular, I really bonded with Nick. If Izzy showed me how to put pictures up, I would show you my awesome group. I built good relationships with all my students and even had some great God conversations with them. I pray that they will continue to seek after Him.   Week Two was far more sporadic, but still interesting. Half of us went to teach English in a classroom setting at a church run by Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun really likes fans and fans himself constantly. He also does not believe in organization or producing details of what he wants us to do. I was one of the English teachers. The others went on adventures with the students from Week One. Their job was&nbsp;very difficult (shopping, bike riding). Anyway, we again built some good relationships with a new group of students, after we had to cattle prod them the first couple days.   Week Three started as a trip to Shanghai. This city puts communism to shame. Apparently, Shanghai is one of the biggest cities in the world, not only in population, but in capitalistism. It looked like LA. In Shanghai people drive on the right side of the road (they drove on the left in Hong Kong). Most people, however, do not like to follow vague traffic rules such as staying in the lanes and stopping at red lights. Pedestrians do not like using crosswalks or sidewalks in Shanghai...they like walking in busy intersections. Also, there are separate lanes for the billions of people riding bikes everywhere. I saw the Yellow River, which looked brown. I went to the top of an eighty-eight story building and there saw Yao Ming's shoe. I also got a massage in my hotel (butt included). The purpose of the Shanghai trip was to take a mini vacation before our last week of ministry got into full swing. And vacation we did. We toured many factories, including a silk carpet factory. There we discovered how long it takes to weave a carpet from silk (answer: a long time). At the end of this tour they brought us into this silk carpet room where they encouraged you to purchase the same silk carpets. Alina, one of our girls liked this really intricate rug (Cost: $23,800 U.S.). The tour dude was very excited that she took interest and offered to sell it for 35% off. Unfortunately, Alina left her wallet in her other pants.   When we came back to Hong Kong, we finished our ministry. We helped at a Christian summer camp there. It was really awesome and I had a great time. We played games, sang songs, gave testimonies, hung out with fun kids. The camp was a good experience. As we were leaving, the camp director said, "Thank you so much for helping." We said that we were honored. He then added, "And you owe us $980 (HK) for use of the facilities." That part was especially exciting. The final day we shopped. Finally, we boarded the plane for 18 hours of pure cramped and restless flight joy home.   Overall, it was amazing. God works in amazing ways. One example: Wes and I went to a church in a place called Tsuen Mun (they divided us up on Sunday mornings) to preach. We both gave messages and then taught a Sunday school lesson to teenage students who did not believe in Jesus. It was a lovely visit. Afterward, I found out that the church originally was hesitant about Americans coming to their services. At the last minute they decided to let us come (and they gave us the royal treatment). After hearing us preach and share with their students, they were inspired to set up a Christian summer camp for teenage students, whom they cared little for before. Also, God worked in all of our lives in different ways. For me personally, God was teaching me all about improving and growing my leadership style and ability.   So that's it. But in case you didn't get enough from what I already said, here are some more quick highlights:   1) Stephen falling down the stairs of a double-decker bus.  2) A freezer in the girls' apartment turning off and producing the foulest smell the world has ever known.  3) My first Hong Kong memory: A guy farting as soon as we stepped off the plane.  4) Flushing our toilet with a plunger every time we used it.  5) Eating pigeon.  6) The 80M and 70 bus lines (our best friend and worst enemy).  7) Shaolin Soccer.  8) Days we didn't have to eat Chinese food (2 or 3 times total).  9) Walking past Jackie Chan's house every day.  10) Travis: The new International Ping-Pong Champion of the World.
