      just got done talking to sam online...god how depressing, i know things have changed between us and its killing me...i want to see her and tell her i love her still, but i dont think she wants to see me for awhile...i told her to call me when shes ready to see me...i wonder how long i will wait for her call before i realize its really over...i wish i was optimistic, i would have to be ignorant to  be optimistic tho...god i wish i was ignorant, it truly is bliss...i hate myself and i want to die...i really do at this point, i wish whatever power is out there would just pity me for once and strike me dead...i dont care how it is done...just get it over with, because i hate living in this dead world without anyone to be loved by...

      well...last nite really sucked, i was crying almost all nite because of the things i was telling sam...i told her how i am scared to lose her and about how my mind works, how i try to sabatoge everything that makes me happy...and i think by telling her all of this i just ended up destroying how she thinks of me, she ended our conversation by pretty much telling me that she doesnt want to see me for awhile...by saying "i prolly wont see you for awhile" which really upset me...i knew it was a bad idea to tell her, but i kinda feel better knowing that someone knows how fucked up my emotions are...i just didnt want this to ruin what we had together, i sat there in tears telling her about everything, i mean i was literally crying my eyes out, i was so ashamed of myself...i tore up my room looking for some dramamine to take, i used it all up on my last down streak...i need to go out and get some more....i think she is going to leave me...i dont know what im going to do if she leaves me, im going to be a wreck, she is the only good that is left in my life, being around her makes me feel truly happy, nothing else makes me feel that way anymore...i must sound so selfish, but i cant help it...i need her love more than i need air, damnit...i knew i shouldnt have told her...i knew it

      ahh what a semi interesting day...started off pretty shitty, woke up talked to sam a bit then i went to jacks house for a couple of hours before i went to the mall with my family, which sucked ass...went to orbit and sold my gameboy for 20 bucks...but i went to sams afterwards and got to see the person i love, which is sam=) she makes me so damn happy, but she also is the one who causes me the worst pain...we went and saw dodgeball today, it was really funny, got back to her house and were just messing around watchin tv...then we were watchin that sunday nite sex show thing, and i asked her how far she has gone with a guy...ive asked her like twice before but she always changes subjects, i know shes a virgin but i wanted to know...just outa curiousity,,,she tells me and i get kinda upset, i dont know why i do this to myself, she has done nothing wrong to me or anything but i still get very distant but at the same time wanting to hold her, its hard to explain..but anyways she picks up that i want to ask her something but im too scared to, its just that im scared of what the answer may be or that i mite remind her of someone she use to love and she would just stop loving me, the thought of losing her kills me, and im so damn scared that she will leave me for someone else...god i hate being so dependant on someone but i just cant help it, i need someone to love and be loved by...and the thought of her loving someone else and doing something with another person, just tears me apart, because...well im not sure she always says how much she loves me and that she would never cheat on me and i beleive her, i really do...its just that mayb one day she will just lose interest in me and ...well you know...blah, i hate myself...i dont understand anything about me, im a total mystery to myself, how i act around people is so weird to me, i dont understand why i am the way i am...i dont understand why im still alive, i have nothing in this world, no one except sam, who i love so much, she is the only one keeping me sane at this point, shes keeping me grounded to life...without her i dunno where i would be right now, certainly not here typing a stupid journal no one will read because i wont give anyone the address in fear of them finding out the real me...something i dont even know myself...how i hate this life

      god how today sucked, i did absolutly nothing the whole fucking afternoon. i hung out at the mall by myself talking to Drew at a pretzel stand, if that doesnt scream reject im not sure what does...after that i went out to dinner with my parents, well i was forced to go at least, so i show up at this damn dinner everything is fine, im sitting in the corner of the booth not talking or looking up, we eat...then they start talking to me like they actually care about how my life is. this slowly turns into a lecture about how i have a lot of freedom to do what i like "which most kids do not have" is what my fuckin father says, then they tell me they want to meet all of my friends and want to talk to their parents and know where im at all the fucking time...thats what we call "american freedom" then they start asking if samanthas mom is home because my mom wants to talk to her about the hickies that i have on my neck, i get pissed and leave the place. i get to sams house and my fucking mom calls and wants to talk to sams mom, which i deny her, then they threaten to come get me and take my car away. so i get really pissed but i finally let my mom talk to sams mom which wasnt that bad because i told my mom not to say anything that would get sam into trouble, which she really didnt i dont think....but anyways after that sam is pissed at me and im trying to hold back my tears, because i get emotional easily and she just yelled at me about dragging "my shit" to her...which just makes me feel like shit which i almost always do except when im with samantha, but her telling me this just makes me want to break down and cry like i use to....but i guess she was sorry and we talked for a bit before i had to leave....i cry on the way home because im still worked up about how my life sucks ass, i get home and i down a lot of dramamine because i dont want to dream tonite and dramamine almost always whipes dreams in my sleep, but it makes me feel like shit the whole next day but its worth it in my case...so now im just sittin here waiting for the pills to knock me out, i decided to make a new journal since my livejournal didnt really work out that great...so ya this was my first post, no one will read any of this but its nice to be able to get shit off my chest

      well...another worthless day for another worthless person...heh monday rolled around and i wake up...get online to check my mail...and guess what..sam emailed me and said that she wanted to break up with me...i emailed her back...still havnt heard from her lol...i guess she must really despise me if she wont even email me back or talk to me at all anymore...i dont really know what i did to bring this down upon me....its weird how i seem to attract the worst things out of the best things...i mean 2 weeks ago me and her were fine...she was telling me how much she loved me and how happy i make her...now she doesnt love me, i dont seem to make her happy, and she wants absolutly nothing to do with me...how i was able to switch her feelings for me so fast is amazing...i think ive found another hidden talent...fucking destroying everything i love, everything that makes me happy...god i wish this horrid excuse for a life would just end soon....but i guess i will have to sit thru it for awhile...im saving up money to buy a car so i can move out....hmm....i think this bird outside my window hurt its wing...its just sitting there with its wing stretched out....*sigh* looks like i found another miserable creature...or it found me...tends to be the situation....blah...i went to the mall yesterday before work and got myself the new TBS and atreyu cds...that kinda made me smile a bit....not a lot has been making me smile lately, not much use in smiling these days....everything that makes me smile goes away soon enough....im trying to turn my deep depression into something that i can use other than writing depressing music...i want to try and turn it into some sort of angry desire for something better, i wish i could just be emotionless other than a deep desire for self knowledge...i wish i could just not fall in love, not get hurt, not have any feelings for people around me....but nope, i have to be one of those people with empathy....someday tho...someday i mite be able to forget about the life around me and become one of those true assholes who cares nothing about anyone, until that day tho, im going to be a sick child full of empathy....o well...i'll live (unfortunatly)

      well last nite i was on the brink of suicide, i cant beleive she said she wasnt sure if she still loved me...i dont know how we started talking about the shit we did, she asked me if i thought she was cheating on me...which i really dont, i just fabricate things inside my head and sometimes its hard for me to distinguish realitly from the fiction i create, she doesnt think i trust her, i do trust her...i trust her more than ive ever trusted anyone else....we are taking a "break" right now...her idea not mine, i begged her to reconsider, she said she forgives me for hurting her....and that she does love me...but i dunno if she is going to want to stay with me or not...i wrote her a poem...and a note that i wanna send her thru the mail..but i realize i dont have her address so its hard for me to send her something without her address...i tried that reverse phone # look up thing but i think they are unlisted because it didnt work....i cant beleive this is happening i cant beleive she wants to take a break..i havnt seen her in almost a week and its driving me insane...i want to see her so bad but i cant because im grounded argh i hate my life...i cant beleive this i woke up this morning crying, i started throwing up because i feel sick..i feel like im dying when im not with her....but when i was throwing up it was just water and acid...i cant eat...i know im hungry its just that i cant eat because i feel so sick...i want to die...literally...the only thing keeping me here is the hope that she still mite take me back...and things mite return to how they were ....i wish we talked about all of this stuff earlier...she just kept it all inside and then released it all in one nite...im hoping it just overwelmed her and that she needs a couple of days to comprehend what all went on last nite...it was overwhelming for me too...but i understood that it was built up over the months...and was just released all at once...i want to be with her...i love her so much its unbeleivable....she means the world to me...i cant imagine being without her...this is the longest ive been without seeing her and its killing me....i have no feelings...all i taste is ash and all i feel is pain, people talk to me but i dont listen, i just stare ahead and try to acknowledge their existance...ive been listening to bright eyes the whole time....its all i have been listening to....all i do is cry, then last nite she wanted a break...all i did that whole nite was cry...i cried more last nite than i think i have ever cried....i rewrote the poem so it was readable...the page is soaked with tears because i couldnt stop crying...then i wrote a note to her...which is also soaked with my salty tears....i just want to die right now...no one would miss me if i just hung myself on a tree in the middle of the nite...no one would bother to cut me down...they would just stare at my corpse and pity me...they would just think about how good i had it and how shitty i made my life out to be...why i cant learn to be happy i dunno...i want to be happy i really do...i just cant...i dont feel right when im happy...i think misplaced...like the ground is no longer mine to walk on...i wish no one caught us running away....i wouldnt have had to deal with all of this heartache then...i wouldnt have to be sitting here crying writing in a journal no one knows about...i place my feelings online, not telling anyone i know about it...but secretly wishing someone i know will stumble upon this and see how messed up i really am...everyone knows i have problems but no one knows the extent...samantha has the clearest picture of my problems...she knows more than anyone else...i let her into my heart immediatly...something i said i wouldnt do anymore...something i promised myself, a promise i broke...i broke it for her...she doesnt know how much she means to me...or that i let her into my life after i swore i would die alone...die depressed...in my own self loathing..self pitying&nbsp; way...
