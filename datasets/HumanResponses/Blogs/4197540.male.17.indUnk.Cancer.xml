      Name: Shanon Hoehne Age: 17 Occupation: NONE Sex: Gay Male Status: In love with a very indulgent person Today is one of those OMG... Just shoot me already, days. I traveled around Pottstown looking for a job all day today. I have found a couple of them. My taste for jobs are not very appealing. It is what I want or nothing. Maybe it is wrong to be bull headed but, if I become more sympathetic will people treat me like dirt? I am in love. My boy friend is 22. He is a buy/planner at a top secret facility. (OK. Not top secret but, I can't tell ya) He loves me as much as anyone could love another person. In my past writings I have called my self a wearisome and pathetic person. Eddie, my boyfriend, makes me feel like that someone I have been trying to find inside. He taught me, WHO cares what others think about you. He loves me and I know it. I love him so much. Some people are probably thinking.. What does he know about love? Good question. What do I know? All I know is I have this feeling of loneliness when we are apart. I don't feel myself. My heart aches when we are not together. I have gotten to the point of udder obsession. If this ain't love... What is? I have felt 100% better since I have met Ed. I was on total and complete melt down when I found Eddie. Next obvious question... How do you know he loves you? Lets answer that question with another question. What type of guy would stick by my side through my fears, my nightmares, my parents, friends and work? Who will listen to every word you say no matter what you are saying. Logical answer. Someone who has a great deal of care for you as a person. He sees me as a person not a "rag doll" or "sex toy". I unfortunately have experienced being both. From the rapes of my uncle and the beatings from my father. He takes all of my worries away. This is my life. You are welcome to join me if you are willing to listen and comment.

      I woke up this morning to a terrible night mare. Eddie woke me. During all of this the feeling of self pity and disgust, I thought to myself... Where did I go right or What did I do right to deserve him? Is he a mere image of happiness or more? I feel like I am holding a key in my hands and this particular key opens anything I can imagine. Is there something in my life that I have not yet crossed? I feel that I have an even rougher road ahead. At the end of my dream my Aunt appeared to me and said... "Stay with him no matter what happens. There will be some roads that seem hard to get through but, he will be there in the end, and the end.... is all that counts. HE will be with you ...."Â  I awoke to Ed's face, beauty and love. So, I sit here wonder that age old question ..... What did I do right? ..............

      I do not want to sound like a sissy boy but, I am really scared. I don't want to go to bed but, I have to. I feel tired but, I know the minute I fall asleep he will be there waiting for me. Why does my uncle terrorize me in my dreams so much? Why do I let him get the best of me? I think the question I really want answered is how is this effecting Eddie? If you are reading this Ed. Please let me know. This has to be effecting you in some manner. I just wish you did not have to deal with my burdens. I am sincerely hoping I do not dream tonight. I will let you know if I do. I am now signing off with one last note:  EAT YOUR VEGETABLES!

      I am so scared. I feel as if he is right next to me watching me. My dreams torment my mentality and my mental strength. I do not know if I am able to stick with my plan. I planned to sleep and not wake up until I have fought the battle. My Uncle is one of the most paralyzing fears I own (other than losing Eddie). I wish that I could have all of my nightmares removed. I wish I could always be with Eddie. Eddie always woke me up while I was having nightmares but, he was not here. I can not stop the feeling of fear of my Uncle. In my dream my uncle kept appearing to me he molested m about 10 times each time I woke up but, not really. I was in a dream and woke up into another dream that felt like I was really awake but, he came back. When I actually woke up I feared I wasn't truly awake so I cried and begged for my life. I wish he would go away.................

      I had a wonderful weekend with Ed. I love him to death. He treats me with love and compassion. Most of all he makes me feel like a real person. This is something I never had. He cares for me in a unique way. He shows me he loves me anyway he can. Like sex,.... he wants my opinion. Does he fuck or I? Then he makes sure I am comfortable. He checks to see if I am ok. I love him so much and I know that he loves me. I just can not help myself with this stupid question. What did I do right? Be =fore I met him I was always being abused so I always asked: What did I do wrong? Ed has left a comment telling me that I don't have to do anything for him to love me. I just cannot help myself. What did I do in my past to deserve his love? That is my real question........

      Good morning everyone. I am happy to say that I did not have any nightmares last night. I think it is because I redecorated my room and was listening to my love CD all night. My love CD is a CD from Eddie on my 17th birthday. I cannot confess my love enough to this man. I love him alot. Well, I am on my way to a beautiful morning. Lots of work to do. I love you Eddie.

      Boy, I had so much fun lst night! I went to bingo with my aunt in Royersford. I took 20 out of the ATM. I thought I was never going to win. Well, towards the end I won on the lucky bonus. I got 80 bucks back!!! I then spent the night at my aunt's house for the first time. It was ok just hot and sticky as for my nightmares, I still have them. I wish I could just get rid of them. Well, I will talk to you later. I have to do some school work.

      I was at Eddie's house this weekend. I had alot of fun! We saw AVP ( Alien VS. Preditor). It was pretty cool. There was this really cool girl that sat behind us! Her boyfriend was like "Yo, their gay!" she said "Who cares?." Ed and I was like YOU GO GIRL! Well, I got home about 2 hours ago and my weekend went bad. Kim, had her toe crushed by her horse. Celina asked me to come in my room and I said "No not now." and Kim flipped a wig and then shot me down. She was like "You, only let my kids in your room when brittany is here. SO , you know what ... since you wanna treat my kids differently, Ed is not allowed in my house." OMG, I kinda flipped. I told her that I did not want Celina in there tonight. I never said she wasn't allowed in there period. All I want to do is wait for Ed to call me then I was going to bed. Well, she was not feeling it. So, I sat down and John and I talked. He said its just that when ever Celina wants to come in your room you always say no. I replied... What time is it that she is always asking...? Bed time .. she does it so she don't have to go to bed. John looked kim and said he has a point. Well, Kim is in the stage where her kids are never wrong.... so she gave him a mean look. Well, she ended the conversation with "...and if I am feeling like a bitch tomorrow or the next day, or the next day, or the next day I just wont let you talk to Ed on my phone."  Then she gave me the guilt trip like Celina let you move in to HER room paint it any color and on top of that you treat her like shit. I did not know what to do or say. I am just a little upset right now. UGH! I don't know what to do.... Well, I hope my audience can help. I am off to bed and will see you tomorrow.

      Well, I am off to bed but, before I say good night I hav something to vent. Tomorrow is the date. The date that will change my life. I go to court tomorrow. I can't help to feel scared. I wonder what my parents are going to say. I am going to court so my brother John could get custody of me since I was removed from my house because my father threatened to shoot me. Why did he threaten to shoot me? I told him I was gay. Sometimes I think I shouldn't have done anything. Eddie reminds me that what I am doing is best and I love him for that. I dont think there is even a word for what I feel for him. Well, I love you Ed. I am off to Bed. Hey that rhymes. lol
