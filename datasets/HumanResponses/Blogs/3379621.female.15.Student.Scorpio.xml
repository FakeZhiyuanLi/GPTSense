      Hey my blogger...How are you? I'm peachy. I'm going crazy...I'm talking to a blog. I changed my layout back because that other one was stupid and was plain and ugly. Okay so I will update you all on my weekend alright? alright. Friday I had school I had to carry my pokemon bag, people stared and laughed. But Cory was like OMG Ashley your pokemon bag is cool. And I genuinely believed him. He can be really nice and constantly people are calling him fat and ugly and he goes along with it because they are his friends, I mean its okay sometimes but to deal with that... I couldn't Cory is TOUGH LOL. And then mike said he liked my bag at lunch and I was happy for a little bit. Then I went to all my classes and at the end of the day me Carly and Valeria got picked up by Elisa- valerias aunt and Olga- her mom. We went to Plum's ( Elisa's store where valeria works) and me and Carly went to Clair's and tried on fake hair stuff LOL. It was fun these little girls looked at us weird tho. Then we went back to the store and sat there and played with our cell phones. And then me and Carly went down to the new restaurant in the mall and we ordered subs. We got free pop :) LOL. Then we went back to the store and ate them..yum. These little girls all came in, they were in 4th grade and had these little purses it was cute, and they bought this "fart sucker" and it gives u gas if you eat it. Well they were telling us that this girl paige likes this one girls crush and stuff and paige calls her stuff. So valeria goes "what does she call you?" and she's like "stuff like an H-O-R and a B-I-T-C-H" so now one of our jokes is your such an HOR. thennn me and Carly get the bright idea to push Carly down the hall ways of the mall to go get some refills on our pop in the rolly-chair thing. Well we did, she almost hit a janitor, a garbage can and pop machine. We saw McKeon and Carlys like MCKEON! And he didn't hear so I pushed her over there. He's like :S LOL and all confused. Then when we got our pop I bought ice cream.....It was good.oh and by the way I was pushing her in a skirt...LOL that was interesting. Then I pretended I was Kristina from the store and Carly was elisa and we wore their name tags, it was fun. And we looked at the dirty stuff. It was gross...But some of it was funny. Then it was 8 and we cleaned up and Jes and Paola picked us up. It was sooo gross this nasty fat girl had a shirt on and it was one where its split from under your boobs, and It comes down into an upside down V. Well she was going to the ground floor...One of those girls. eiw. Well she was running and she like pulled her fat back. And jes is like "you should yell your fat go puke! out the window", but she was just kidding and Valeria rolls down the window is like "YOUR FAT GO PUT SOME CLOTHES ON" and jes took off and went so fast shes like "SHIT! how many new silver hondas are around here?" and there's like none, she was afraid they were gonna egg her car. It was funny. After that we went to jeremys and watched the t-wolves game for like 2 seconds, and jeremys mom had to bring us to the movies since jes and Paola left to go to a party. So we went to the movies and bought our tickets and then walked down to target. Valeria was mad at Jeremy so he was all sad and like left us to walk around. Well eventually we went to the bathroom. Well Ryan mostaller had bought a hello kitty pillow and I stole it and ran out the door. It was funny, she knew it was me she's like ASHLEY GIVE ME IT BACK! It was funny. Then we went to Shrek 2..It was sooo cute!Then we dropped Jeremy off and went to Valeria's (Me and Carly) We were really overly tired they had lucky charms and I ate ice cream well Carly spilled and valeria thought it was funny and she shot milk out of her mouth, then Carly called me an ass face and I choked on my ice cream and shot it out my nose****gross***** (ass face--inside joke)after that we went to bed and stuff. We woke up at 7:45...I have no clue why, it was all like at the same time too. freakay. Well we talked until 9:30 when we left. And me and valeria were craving subs so we went to the mall and got subs. Carly wanted to go really bad so we left after talking to Kristina at Plum's.  cuz Carly is going to a dashboard concert tonight with Kyle and Cory. she's SO lucky. That goose. LOL. And I got home and I was just looking on the internet for some cd's and stuff and Pat is all like "what are u doing?" I was like "updating my journal" ( lie I  know but whateva :P) and she's like "oh because you spend a lot of time on there and I was wondering what you always do." the way she said it was mean. Like I spend all my time on here. Sorry if I wanted to stay out of her hair, or not have to have her deal with me and lane fighting all the time. im not really on a lot anyways because my moms always home and doing business on here. Ugh. Oh well. I wanted to do something with Jozette today. Fly a kite :D but she's in Duluth and she gets her ipod! she's such a lucky giraffe. Well that's all for now. lubb yas.

      i cant satnd being happy anymore. i was never happy. i have never been happy. i dont think i will ever find "happy" either. im sick of my life, randomly i find myself crying. i hate being ugly and fat, and not being myself... around anyone. i act all happy around people because i have to, its always been like people dont need to know your problems suck it up ashley. i hate this. i remember being so alone and crying and cutting myself. it was horrible and i dont even wanna be close to that again. its like i try so hard for people to like me but in truth they dont know me. because being "high on life" was a cover to not let people get to know me. since i was little i felt like i was never good enough, for anyone. and im not. im not going to fall in love or have a family, and probably not have a job i actully love. im probly not going to acomplish my goals or even make anyone else happy. i mean i can make you laugh, but is that was u really need? im not a great friend and im not special. im not a good student and im a bitch. i cant blame this on my parents for what they did to me, or my dad for what he did to my mom. i cant blame it on the fact i was misterably up untill about 2nd semester and now im back to being my stupid self again. being skinny and pretty isnt gonna help me. being smarts not gonna help me either. i have to find myself. and i doubt that will ever happen. because what do you have if u dont have yourself?

       his house makes me puke. really...its  soo  dirty, even when its clean. cluttered with stuff found at garage sales, puke orange chairs, the house is nice on the inside, hard wood floors, lage arch doors, but its dirty. it makes me sneeze. the outside is gross, black and green and brown are the colors of the make-shift siding....which by the way is roof tile. they never have clean towels and its always smells of mud, cigarettes, and gross food. its a unique smell and everytime i come back here from there i have to take a shower to get the smell off. everything is washed even my pillow. you probably dont even know what&nbsp;he does do you?...hes a  garbage  man. his clothes are stained. but that never bugged me. that meant he worked. i wish i was 5 years old again. playing at&nbsp;his house ( a trailer in blackberry then) i was happy finding toads and salamander, it didnt matter to me that it was stinky. i was happy to be with him. its a void that has never been filled. he abandoned  me... he left and moved to Florida&nbsp;when i was in&nbsp;2nd grade. he called to tell me he was there with his girlfriend and  her  kids. i remember trying so hard not to cry and that moment i hung up i bawled. i will never forget that.&nbsp;he&nbsp;got married to her&nbsp;in Florida. i didnt even know until they returned in my 5th grade year. i remember because i had to miss Brittany Johnson party to go see him in babett.&nbsp; i wish i&nbsp;wasnt shallow. because if i wasnt i could live there with him. maybe be happy being a little stinky. or not having name&nbsp; brand clothes. it wouldnt matter to me.  but it does .    &nbsp;  by telling you this. i risk alot of things..and i guess im willing. im going to let it all go. this is me. its not going to change me. because i knew all along. theres more then this. but you just got the "just" of it. this is all.

      well something strange just happened.-cory im not knocking you but heres the loverly evidence. 1st he posted on my journal under anonymous. and i was searching under grand rapids in the profile section and saw his, i never read it but i just saw he was on blogger too. anyways after that comment was posted and read...ect. i checked his journal and saw similar writing patterns and slang, and phrases. ect. well i came to the conclusion that it was him. so i went on his journal, posted saying how he shouldne have said that without knowing.- i did NOT post my name and i put it under anonymous. i removed GR mn out of my profile so if anyone else from this town saw it they wouldnt have to judge well anyways. i posted it and. well today i see that CORY posted. ( you can all check it out) it has the same manurisums as the 'hurtful' post....and another thing...if he didnt write it the first time....how did he get my journal? i post back, anonyous again( so i cant be traced lol..im sneaky) and said i still thought it was him. and told him i posted under anonymous and i dont care but i think he should think twice about saying stuff like that to somebody. it hurt. and i also said a real man would step up and admit his fault...i know i know im mean lol. but i hope all can be forgiven. i just am like a secret detctive...so WATCH OUT...dun dun da da dunnn..bum bum. lol. ANYWAYS  so my day was pretty boring....i baby-sat from 10:30-4:30. egh..so boring. nothing to do there. came home and ate potatoes. lol. i hope i can come ROCK with jozette this weekend. that would be sooo much fun. i think im gonna make a scedule for my mom. so she can make sure everythings okay. im such a nerd but my moms like that. i dunno. i CANNOT wait CANNOT wait till i move out. it will be the best day of my life. im serious. ooo. anyways. lol. im gonna learn to felt because its cool. and i wanna make a poop person. yep. lol. so jozette im gonna call you tonight if i can maybe to see whats going on. okay? okay :) im gonna go though tootles...
