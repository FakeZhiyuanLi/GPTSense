      There are some things that I would really like to get out and do. One of which is travelling. I would love to pick up today and travel for a year or so anywhere and everywhere, only to return for short visits.  Of course the most awesome way to do this would be to travel around with a band. There is just something about bands that makes it so much more fun. It could be just the fact that it is a group of people going everywhere together. There is also the added benefit of getting to watch and hear all kinds of&nbsp;other bands.  I am working on learning to play instruments. Right now I am working on the guitar. As soon as I can play with some sort of skill I will move on to the bass guitar and then the drums and relearn keys. I am just going to make my rounds and by the time I get done I will be a one woman band of sorts.  I have also decided recently that it would be awesome to take flying lessons. I would love to fly a plane and a helicopter, which goes along with skydiving.  This list could go on and on. I just felt like day dreaming a bit this morning. I often wonder if I wrote a book what kind of things would flow out on the pages if I allowed myself to drift off and dream about all there is to do my short time&nbsp;here. The target is to live an adventurous life.  So the question is... what do you want to do and what do you dream about?

      In an attempt to once again break out of my geekiness, I have&nbsp;entered the world of fashion. I now have&nbsp;some hair streaks going on. If only I were free enough to dye my hair black with some hot pink or purple highlights... I am definitely not that brave, but maybe one day.

      I guess I have enough random thoughts in a day to try this out... the question is, will anyone read it. I guess I will find out!

      If you cooked a meal for dinner and while eating found a hair in it, (assuming that it is yours) would you eat it?

      She came to a crest of the hill that she was walking. Such a long way she had come. So many pathways she had crossed to get to where she was now standing. Looking down on the tree-covered hills of mystery that lie below she pondered what was waiting for her as she continued. The journey so far had been a wonderful adventure with many travelers along the way, but there had also been tears and hardship, dark places and rocks to overcome. She had grown up some how, her opinions and passions had changed. The journey had taken her from what was once a young soul and had made her a strong woman.  She now stood wondering what the rest of the journey would entail. Standing for a moment to wonder where she would go and remembering the path that she had taken so far. This was her calling. Though she strayed from the trail at times she had made it thus far. Something outside of her called for her to continue. There were more pathways to cross, more travelers to meet and more of life to be lived.   I know that currently I am at a pivotal point in my life. There are so many things that I am passionate for and so many things that I want to do. Where will my pathway lead me? I don’t know, but I do know that I am excited to take the first steps. I don’t want to look back and say that my degree or my experiences are a waste. I think that God has used them to show me more who I am and who I am not. So many times we are so willing to do what other people want to make them happy. It is even easier than to try to figure out what it is that you are really made for or what your purpose really is.  I now long for my artistic side. I long to create, paint, read, play my guitar, travel, take photographs, imagine and praise God with all I have. I do not want this life of mediocrity. There are so many things that I love, so many dreams that I hold. I don’t want to simply dream anymore, I want to put a foot out and take a step of faith, I have waited and been safe long enough. I want to be a person of passion. I no longer want to get ensnared by the opinions and doubts of others who are so discouraging in terms of me finding my way. God has made me this way. Oh, how I love the beauty of the freedom we are given.    After a short pause she takes a step forward to continue the journey.

      I took the geek quiz today... so here is how that turned out for me...         You are   28%   geek       You are a geek liaison, which means you go both ways. You can hang out with normal people or you can hang out with geeks which means you often have geeks as friends and/or have a job where you have to mediate between geeks and normal people. This is an important role and one of which you should be proud. In fact, you can make a good deal of money as a translator.    Normal:  Tell our geek we need him to work this weekend.   You [to Geek]:  We need more than that, Scotty. You'll have to stay until you can squeeze more outta them engines!   Geek [to You]:  I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain, but we need more dilithium crystals!   You [to Normal]:  He wants to know if he gets overtime.        urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com

      One of my best friends Jessica got married Saturday. The wedding was a nice outdoor wedding and it turned out to be a great day. It is hard to believe that she is married now. I am excited for her, I think that she picked a good one and will be very happy.  The reception was a great time. I got to see people that I have not seen in a long time and make some new friends. It is interesting how life goes, how we all change and grow over the years.  I am glad that I could be a part of her wedding and celebrate with them.

       Dreams  A maze of wonders and dreams before me A path of stepping-stones behind. So many things to reach for So many days have passed me by. I stand here in silence Waiting to be found. I see life pass by in a moment So many things left undone So many melodies left to be sung. So here I stand World spinning around me Reaching out my hand Drawn to dream once again.

      I must say that I am truly blessed with some awesome friends. My friends were here from Canada in the last couple of weeks, they are in a band and they are all awesome . I got to spend some good times with them while they were here and go on some adventures. I can now play poker and lose with the best of 'em. I will have to brush up on my skills for next time they are here so I have a chance at kicking some butt! I also got to play Halo for the first time and yes it is confirmed, I really stink at it. Fortunately the person I was playing with was very kind and had mercy on me and my inabilities. I think that we all had a great time while they were here and I will definitely miss them.  Oh, the name of the band is Red Umbrella. They are awesome so check them out at redumbrella.net
