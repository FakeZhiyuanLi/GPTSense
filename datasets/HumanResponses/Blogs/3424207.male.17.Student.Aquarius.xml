      Well tomorrow night at this exact time my senior friends are gonna be freshmen once again.....but not in high school.  A new chapter will begin in their lives.  Every senior for the past month has said how much they will miss Mount Carmel because it is such a great school. Then they mention the lifelong friends they have made at MC.  I wish i were that lucky; I only have one friend that will be lifelong.  I wish I had more but I dont, probably because of all the crap thats wrong with me.  Im really looking forward to tomorrow, but in some way it scares me.  Will these people keep in touch or will it be me just trying to call them all summer?  I'll just hope for the best.

      I can't believe that all the seniors are gone.  The halls are much more easier to navigate, with 100 plus students not there of course.     Come September its gonna be kinda sad because my friends will be on their way to college and abandoning high school.  I just hope that I don't get abandoned too...

      Wow, this school year has flown by.  I can't believe that graduation for my senior friends is a week from tomorrow.  Then I get to go to all those graduation parties, which will be cool.  Awesome night last night.  Luke was wasted and he really is funny when he is drunk.  He'd talk to strangers and wander off and stuff.  Hey, he even got a free scoop of ice cream from the ice cream dude.  Fun night for sure.

      So I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 and it really made me think.  The insight that this movie gives people is incredible and it made you laugh too.  Don't believe the information you see in the movie? Check out Michael Moore's web site for proof of the facts in Fahrenheit 9/11. The site is http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latestnews/f911facts/, check it out.  Also go see Fahrenheit 9/11 because it answers questions that many people have and the movie is also a big eye opener.

      I like listening to the air conditioning in my house because it's real peaceful.  It makes me feel good that i'm away from school, learning and that shit.  Just found out my sister's boyfriend got held up at gunpoint, then got pistel whipped.  Luckily they caught the stupid fucks that did it.  They got into an accident moments after driving away from the scene of the crime.  Hahaha, stupid assholes got what they deserved.
