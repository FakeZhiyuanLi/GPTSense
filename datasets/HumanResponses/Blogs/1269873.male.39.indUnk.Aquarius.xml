         Very tired today. I had difficulty sleeping last night due to the heat and a splitting head ache. Yawned my way through most of the afternoon but that's not really unusual. Big day at work tomorrow so I have to wear a tie for the first time in months. Hey ho. Redunancy is once again knocking on the door methinks.  Sleep: 22:30 to 7:45 Eat: Breakfast-Croissant, Lunch-Fruit, Yogurt, Dinner-Quiche Exercise: None Comment: Hot and tired.

         This week's task is one I've been meaning to do for ages. I want to create a proper 2D CAD floor plan of my house. The reason for wanting a scaled plan is related to a business idea I've had running through my head for months now, but I don't want to go into the detail of that just now.   I've already measured the rooms up using an ultrasonic measure I got from eBay a few weeks back so all I need to do is sit down and lay it all out in AutoCad. This shouldn't be too much bother as I am Cadmeister numero uno, except I haven't used AutoCad in years. My business plan however, demands that I learn to use it properly and efficiently which is an important part of this week's task.  Deadline for the task to be completed is Sunday 6th June at 8:00 PM

         It's been very hot today which never puts me in the best of moods to start with. I had to have a little snooze this afternoon as I was completely knackered. Do not feel at all well tonight. I have a headache to top things off nicely.  Sleep: 00:00 to 10:00 Eat: Breakfast-None, Lunch-Pancakes, Dinner-Pork Exercise: None Comment: Very tired and feeling generally low.

        I've just uploaded my first ever item to be auctioned on  urlLink eBay . Just something small and inexpensive to start with but there are a few more expensive things that I want to sell later on. I won't link to the ad as I want to keep my eBay identity and this blog separate. It is remarkably easy to become a seller on eBay with only a few points that you really need to pay attention to.   1. Use eBay's free  urlLink Turbo Lister  software, it's very slow but makes the job remarkably easy. 2. Pay attention to the design and layout of the advert. Stick to one font, size and colour. Use bold and italics sparingly. Do not overload the ad with confusing text. 3. Get a good photograph of the item with plain white background. 4. Be clear on postage charges. As a buyer I never bid on any item that does not declare postage charges. Add a bit to the postage if you have to cover Paypal charges (but don't overdo it). 5. Register with Paypal. The charges are expensive but the savings in time and effort from dealing with cheques etc are worth it in my opinion. 6. Do not surcharge for Paypal payments. Again, I never bid on an item that only has Paypal payment and a hefty surcharge.  Task complete ahead of schedule!

        urlLink   As I am an Engineer (I've got a fancy bit of paper somewhere that says so) I find this sort of thing fascinating. The site  urlLink Sodaplay  allows you to create virtual machines from beams, masses and springs and by tweaking the parameters, make them walk. Once you hit upon the perfect design you can race your creation against competitors from all over the world.  You can even grow your own virtual machine by using a genetic algorithm, called  urlLink Wodka , to breed a unique creation. Give it a go.

        urlLink    Is it possible to hate so many people in so little time? Not for me, as I dislike everybody but this bunch of cretins really take some beating (and a beating I predict they will take, the first time they stick their arse in a nightclub the day after being booted out of the house).  I plan to take the moral high ground and not sully my brain by watching their antics... but then again, I may get hoplessly hooked.

        I just about managed to survive the trip to Ikea in Glasgow yesterday but the traffic was something else. I'd definitely get an Automatic if I had to drive through Glasgow regularly. 1 hour 30 minutes to travel 12 miles through town on The M80, ridiculous.  Understandably tired and very stiff today but I actually feel a lot better than what I normally do on a weekend. Fingers crossed I'm OK tomorrow as well. My dietary intake  continues to be crap but I am going to make a concerted effort to improve. I want to cut out all dairy produce but as I don't drink milk this will probably focus on eggs and cheese.  Sleep: 24:00 to 9:45 Eat: Breakfast-Toast, Lunch-Fish, Dinner-Burger Exercise: None Comment: Tired and stiff.

        I'm really tired tonight as things seem to be going to type and rapidly heading downhill as the weekend approaches. I slept OK last night and didn't exactly exert myself at work today so there is no real reason to be overly tired today. On holiday tomorrow with a long drive to Glasgow ahead of me and then trailing round Ikea.  Sleep: 23:00 to 7:45 Eat: Breakfast-Toast, Lunch-Apples, Bananas, Dinner-Chicken Sandwiches Exercise: None Comment: Very Tired.

        Feeling not too bad today even though it was a crap day at work. Very tired tonight though, as the week grinds on. I've scored a holiday for Friday which is nice but I've promised Lesley to take her to Ikea. Hmmm, I hate Ikea.  Sleep: 23:00 to 7:30 Eat: Breakfast-Toast, Lunch-Apples, Bananas, Dinner-Roast Chicken with all the trimmings Exercise: None Comment: Tired.

        To ensure I do not degenerate into a comatose state I will set myself small tasks to be completed each week. One of the effects of ME is to make it very difficult to concentrate on completing tasks as well as the physical and mental exhaustion. Last week I set myself the goal of getting this weblog up and running, which I achieved.   The task for this week is to find out all about selling stuff on eBay from payment methods, terms and conditions to creating a professional looking ad etc. It may seem simple and easy to you but for somebody with ME it can be a huge drain on their energy to do something like this. Although I've bought stuff on eBay for years I have never got around to selling anything. There is no shortage of items that I will hopefully be advertising soon.  Deadline for the task to be completed is Sunday 30th May at 8:00 PM

        I plan to create one of these posts every night to form an online journal of how I feel day to day. I seem to feel worse at the weekends and I need to figure out why this should be the case. I know my diet is crap but I have been taking steps recently to improve it with lots of fruit, I just forgot to take any to work with me today.  Sleep: 23:00 to 7:30 Eat: Breakfast-None, Lunch-Sandwich, Crisps, Twix, Dinner-Burger, Chips Exercise: None Comment: Feeling OK. Just a little tired.

        Just so you don't think I'm a hard hearted b*stard here's a picture of Lesley's (my better half) new 7 week old kittens, Bonnie and Clyde. I only agreed to have one but you have to admit, it would be impossible to split them up.

         Read all about Henrik Larsson's last competitive appearance in a Celtic shirt, see pages 2,3,4,5,6,7,8... and so it goes on. Larsson's last appearance at home, his last appearance away, his last appearance in a competitive match, his last testimonial appearance in a Celtic shirt, just go will you? Frank Sinatra was quicker saying goodbye, and had less farewell appearances than this guy. Yes he was a good goal scorer, yes he was a great foreign import, yes he allowed Celtic to win more than their style of play has ever deserved.   Frank Sinatra was quicker saying goodbye, and had less farewell appearances than this guy.   Will Celtic struggle to replace him? Probably, there can't be many ugly ginger gits left who can play a bit and haven't already been signed by Martin O'Neill but that's his problem... and yes, I am a Rangers supporter.

       I was finally diagnosed in March 2004 as suffering from ME, previously known by the widely held derogatory term of "Yuppie Flu", but now recognised by the Medical establishment and better known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Although it is now officially recognised as a serious illness there is no known treatment for it. Self help and research was all my Doctor could advise and to steer clear of American information sites who tended to err on the side of sensationalism (who'd have thought it eh?). So there you have it, "You're ill but there's nothing we can do for you". If you'd like to know more about the illness then please check out the link section. I'd love to hear from anybody out there who is also fighting this depleting illness.  I plan to use this weblog to keep a daily journal of how I feel, what I've ate, how much I slept, exercise taken etc. With this information I hope to begin the long and hard road to recovering some semblance of a normal life. I'll also use it to post things of general interest, rants, pet peeves, news etc for those who might find it of interest.

        I haven't been feeling too bad recently. I still get very tired but I don't think I've been as sluggish as I have in the recent past. I think trying to cut out a lot of the crap from my diet has helped a lot. I've managed to make inroads in eating healthier. There is still the odd lapse but all in all I'm quite chuffed.  I take vitamin supplements every day to help boost my immune system and make up for the nutrients lacking in my food intake. I also take Evening Primose oil which I read is supposed to help people with ME/CFS. I definitely sleep better and as I've mentioned before my general mood has improved.  All chocolate biscuits have been consumed in the house and only 1 packet is bought in the shopping (for when we have visitors) a week. I've even managed to resist overdosing on chocolate... hmmm chocolate... while at work and out of sight from Lesley. Must try harder though. Onwards and upwards.

        I've been enjoying these European Championships. It's great to see overpaid, puffed up superstars get humped by much less glamorous players and teams. One by one the big guns have fallen; Spain, Italy, Germany, France and of course England. England, oh England... you really should have won this trophy, it had your name written all over it even more so than the last World Cup which you also threw away. You actually have a solid little team there which unlike the other superstar nations, listed above, are the right side of 30.   So what went wrong? It was plain to see through my eyes of a Northern Irishman living in Scotland. Beckham wasn't fit or interested or very good and your manager, Sven, was scared, cautious, blind, tactically inept etc etc. Scollari had the balls to hook the useless Luis Figo and won the match (and probably the Championship). Sven didn't have the balls to hook Beckham and lost.  I actually predicted before the England v France match kicked off that Beckham would retire from International football at the end of the Championship. It is looking like he won't, but he should. The writing has been on the wall for him for a long time now. Ferguson knew it and acted upon it, Sven now knows it but will never act.  England will easily qualify from their World Cup group (along with my beloved Norn Iron... I can dream can't I?) but unless Sven ditches Beckham for good, the same painful story of Referee bias, unlucky breaks, crumbling penalty spots, long season etc etc will be replayed over and over again. I can hardly wait.

         Still no conclusion to the task I set myself a few weeks ago to learn AutoCad and complete a floorplan of my house.   However, the business idea I mentioned is starting to take shape and a former colleague who is currently unemployed is very keen to get it up and running. So, my actions are to complete the floorplan along with a number of other small projects to use as examples of some of the services we plan to offer. I'll also be responsible for getting a website up and running, designing the company logo and stationary etc. All very exciting and now that I have someone on board to the boring planning stuff it might just fly. Watch this space.

        Another long period of non posting to this blog. Again, no excuses, in fact I've been feeling much better these past couple of weeks. Still get very tired, still have my "bad" days (mood swings) but all in all much better I think. I've cut way down on take-aways and have actually stuck to it at both work and home which is good. I haven't weighed myself in a while though but hopefully I'll post on that soon.

       I mentioned a few posts ago that my boss had become hooked on financial spread betting and he was doing very well at it. At one point he was up by over 1000 quid all in a matter of 4 days. Then came the inevitable losing streak which has reduced his winnings to 250 quid. He is now re-evaluating his strategy.  Being much more cautious myself I have been playing with a few fantasy bets to help me understand how the whole thing works and to formulate a consistent trading plan to hopefully allow success. I am concentrating on Binary Bets of the hourly FTSE and Dow indices. In a binary bet you buy and sell an index to fall or rise in an hour period. So if you bought the FTSE 100 to rise at 45 points, and by the end of the hour it did rise above it's hourly starting point the binary bet would pay out at 100. That would mean a profit of 100-45*5(your stake per point)=220 quid. Seems quite simple and looking at the intra day graphs for the FTSE and Dow I have identified a strategy which should allow me to win 10 points at least on average 3 times a day. If I bet 5 quid a point I could make 150 quid tax free a day while keeping a limit on my risk of losing the original stake.  I've registered with  urlLink IG Index  as my dealer of choice if you want to learn more.

         I still haven't managed to complete the floorplan task I set myself a few weeks ago. I have had a business idea floating around my head for months now and creating an AutoCad 2D floorplan of my house is an important part of proving out the validity of the idea. To aid me I discussed the idea with a former colleague who was very enthusiastic about the whole thing. Suffering from ME though I find it very hard to devote the huge amount of energy required in holding down a full time job and creating a business empire. The plotting I can do it's just the actual doing that I struggle with.  I will try and get the plan done by the end of this coming week (football permitting) and begin to firm up some of the plans I discussed with my friend.

       They say bad luck comes in threes. My Sky box is buggered, the kittens have just smashed a large table lamp and now the microwave (depending from which point of view you look at it) is knackered. Let me explain.  Lesley: The microwave is buggered Me: Oh, is it? What's wrong? Lesley: Only the number 3 works on the keypad. Me: Oh! Lesley: We will have to get a new one. Me: Eh? *looks scared* Lesley: It's broken. Me: But it still works... look...beep beep beep (Power level 3 for a time of 3 minutes 33 seconds)... there you go, perfect. Lesley: Eh? *looks puzzled*  I ask you, all it takes is a bit of lateral thinking.

       I'm an easy going type of guy. It generally takes a lot to get me really riled but when I am, watch out. Haggling is not something I do, as I am too shy and just want an easy life with no confrontation. But when a company takes 40 quid a month off me and then wants a further 65 for an Engineer visit then all my related buttons are pressed. Sky and their ever expanding subscription fee have just pressed all my buttons and suffered the backlash as a result. My digibox is buggered, has never really worked properly for ages (modem burnt out) which never really bothered me, but now it has gone kaput. Cue the obligatory service call to a nice lassie in Scotland who did the normal script finishing with we'll need to book an Enginner's visit and that will be 65 quid sir. Oh no it won't sez me. Sorry I can't help you sez her. Fine I'll cancel my subscription...click. Ring ring ring press all the buttons on your phone simultaneously while whistling the semi-crotchet version of Les Marsellies etc etc. I get through to some poor git in India... I want to cancel my subscription... puzzled silence, I'll just pass you over to the relevant department ( he was the relevant department)... click.. ring, some guy in Scotland comes on... what's the problem?.. I'm not paying 65 quid for you to continue taking 40 off me a month, I want to cancel... blah blah blah... I'll speak to my Manager to see if we can reduce the call out charge... zero is the number I have in mind... it won't be free sir... fine I want to cancel then... I'll just speak to my manager.... dum de dum de dum.. hello sir... yes... my manager has agreed to make it free of charge... thank you sez me, click.  It was while looking for the service number to call that I discovered on the net that Sky are about to increase the subscription price again in September. Bastards. I will wreck my current Sky box totally, get a new one free from them and then reduce my package to something a bit more sensible (no movies). I hope a lot more subscribers start biting back at this company. It must be a thankless task working in a call centre (I once read a report that described call centres as the new dark satanic mills of the 19th century) and I really don't enjoy giving people a hard time doing their job but when it's my cash (or lack there of) that is at stake, watch out.

        No update for 5 days, no excuses, I can't think why I haven't. Been a bit busy I suppose. I got a loan of the LCD projector from work for the weekend and watched the England-France match in glorious 10 feet wide technicolour... oh yes, and the manner of the result just topped it off. Perfect.  Work has deteriorated to such an extent that the boss spends his time spread betting on the FTSE hour by hour. He was 900 quid up after 2 days though so I am investigating this phenomena with interest.

       I'll not beat about the bush. Still stuck at the same weight with  ZERO  loss (much to Lesley's amusement whose favourite phrase has become fat arse)... cheeky cow.  All is not lost though, no gain is a cause for celebration and the in-house biscuit supply is dwindling rapidly with a strict no purchase-zone in place around the biscuit aisle at Tescos. Not be long now before I emerge like a beautiful butterfly from this cocoon of lard (I can dream can't I?)

Today I even managed to cut the grass for the first time in ages.

         I haven't managed to finish this week's task as it was quite involved so I've decided to carry it over until next week.  I have the ground floor walls all drawn but I still need to add the doors and windows. I could do it quite quickly and messy but for what I want to use the plan for it is better to do it properly with continuous lines, split up on layers etc. Once I have the ground floor completed it should be very quick and easy to complete the first floor.  Deadline for the task to be completed is now Sunday 13th June at 8:00 PM   Weekly Task 1 Update   The item I placed on eBay for auction last week has now closed with 5 bids. I got a good price for the item as well. Fingers crossed the payment, shipping and feedback goes smoothly. Once the first sale is completed I'll try something with a bit more value.

        urlLink   As I sit here writing this, 60 years to the moment, when hundreds of thousands of troops were all ready on the ships and landing craft somewhere in the English Channel, paratroopers were beginning to land inland, the French Resistance began their campaign of sabotage and so on, I can only feel humble and give thanks for their efforts and sacrifice. I hope everyone who has benefited for what was done on this day 60 years ago will do the same, either privately or publicly, in some small way, today.   They shall not grow old as we who are left grow old. Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.

       I have decided to create separate posts for my 3 day weight updates.   Well, the scores are in and have been verified after 17 recounts, hopping on one leg, stripping to the bufty, I can reveal that I lost/gained  zero  lbs since the last weigh-in.   I'm not down hearted as at least I'm still the same fat b*stard I was 3 days ago and not some even fatter b*stard. I'm confident that with some graded, light exercise I can do something about this.  Chocolate biscuits remain my ultimate downfall (along with Pizza, Chinese, Kebabs and the single most important food group of them all... chips with everything). Why is it that ME destroys my ability/appetite for anything except food? Never a break.  Next weight update: 08/06/04

        Not feeling too bad today considering the stress at work. Got off to a slow start this morning though but I think I slept OK and the temperature was just fine. I have decided that my weight situation has now reached a critical point. I will lose weight. I will, I will, I will.   I've never exactly been thin and I never will be but the state I'm in at the moment is out of control. My large appetite for all the wrong things at the wrong time and a lifelong aversion to exercise, work etc got me off to a bad start. But, with the onset of ME my activity levels have reached near zero levels and so the weight has piled on. It is going to be hard juggling the physical and mental exhaustion caused by ME with the task of eating less and exercising more but it has to be done as it will only compound the damage being done by the ME. I don't want to reveal my current weight as it is so gross but I will publish my weight loss (or gain) in lbs, every three days on this weblog.

        Fame at last. A nervous morning at work waiting for the new Financial Controller to appear and make us all redundant (not yet though) and I open the latest copy of  urlLink The Engineer  (Magazine related to all things technology and innovation, 28 May - 10 Jun 2004) and what do I see on the inside page? Something I designed, oh be still my beating heart.   Smug git maybe, but a smug git whose work has appeared in the best read Engineering Magazine   Yes folks to demonstrate the skill of Britain's finest die-casters they show a picture of a casting I designed for a light mixing desk along with a picture of the finished article. My boss' face was a picture as I enquired if he had ever seen anything of his in The Engineer. Smug git maybe, but a smug git whose work has appeared in the best read Engineering Magazine... and I usually only read the job adverts and wile away the afternoon trying to do the brain teaser on the back page.

        Two things of note to report about the ongoing business project that I'm hoping to set up with a former colleague.  1. My business partner did some real life market research into our proposed venture. The results were disappointing, but this was not entirely unexpected. It shows us that we need to target a smaller, niche market than what we originally planned, at least in the beginning. The downside of this, obviously, is that we will have fewer potential clients, but the upside is that the services we will provide will be of higher value. Swings and roundabouts.  2. We have decided to register a domain name for use as the company website and e-mail purposes. The name settled upon is www.visualproperty.co.uk. At the moment we have just parked the domain and will sort out hosting services later.  Work continues on researching the market, creating samples and pulling it all together into a cohesive business plan.

        Recently I  urlLink asked  if anyone knew of good sites for finding freely downloadable music that could be possibly added to videos I'm making in Microsoft's Movie Maker 2 software. Lo and behold I stumble upon just such a  urlLink site  with, it claims, links to over 1 million freely downloadable tracks. Now I'm sure their use doesn't include ripping them off and publishing some multi-million pound blockbuster but as that project is not due to go into production until next year I think I'm safe enough for now.     I've only sampled a few of the links included in the list and I must say some of the music is quite good and I'm bound to find something suitable. Maybe you've been wondering how to fill your 40Gb IPod, well here's the answer.

        It is very hot and muggy here at the moment. I've never been too keen on hot weather and with my illness it drains me even more. Being on holiday though is definitely helping me to recharge my batteries and I'm not feeling as tired as I have been. Drinking loads of mineral water to keep myself hydrated. I stopped drinking tap water last year when I suffered bad stomach cramps after buying one of those water filter containers for the fridge. Maybe I should get a rebate on my water rates?

        A comment made recently about the performance of Li-Ion rechargeable batteries has prompted me to publish a quick set of guidelines on how to get the best performance and life from your battery.   Most rechargeable batteries are now of the Li-Ion chemistry variety, which has, replaced the older Ni-Cad and NiMh technologies mainly through improved energy density by weight and volume. The most common applications include mobile phones, laptop computers, digital cameras and MP3 players.   One of the big claims about Li-Ion when it first started to appear on the market is that it did not suffer from the “memory effect” whereby if a battery is repeatedly only partially discharged before recharging, the battery "forgets" that it has the capacity to further discharge all the way down. For example, if you, on a regular basis, fully charge your battery and then use only 50% of its capacity before the next recharge, eventually the battery will become unaware of its extra 50% capacity which has remained unused. The battery will remain functional, but only at 50% of its original capacity. While, in theory, the Li-Ion chemistry should not display this condition the reality is slightly less than clear-cut. It is especially important in laptop batteries that you do not repeatedly “top-up” the charge. This will destroy your very expensive laptop battery in record time. I’ll not go into the reasons why but a large part of the problem is the “fuel gauging” that is built into a laptop battery. I’m sure you’ve all discovered that a laptop rapidly loses its ability to hold a charge after only a few months. Most laptops are used at the desk plugged into the mains anyway. If this is the case, remove the battery. Only recharge the battery when it is nearly fully discharged. To a lesser extent this will help the performance and life of single cell applications such as phones, cameras and MP3 players.   The top tips for rechargeable battery care are:    Temperature   Excessive high temperature will destroy a rechargeable battery’s capacity very quickly. New devices to keep laptops cool are now available for this very reason. Do not leave your mobile phone on the dashboard on a sunny day. The internal cell will be damaged, the battery will swell and could leak.   Break In New Batteries   New batteries come in a discharged condition and must be fully charged before use. It is recommended that you fully charge and discharge the new battery two to four times to allow it to reach its maximum rated capacity.   Prevent the Memory Effect   Keep the battery healthy by fully charging and then fully discharging it periodically.   Keep the Batteries Clean   It's a good idea to clean dirty battery contacts with a cotton swab and alcohol. This helps maintain a good connection between the battery and the device.   Exercise the Battery   Do not leave the battery dormant for long periods of time. It is recommend using the battery at least once every two to three weeks. If a battery has not been used for a long period of time, perform the new battery break in procedure described above.   Battery Storage   If you don't plan on using the battery for a month or more, it is recommend storing it in a clean, dry, cool place away from heat and metal objects. NiCad, NiMH and Li-Ion batteries will self-discharge during storage; remember to break them in before use.

         Who'd have thought it? Microsoft&nbsp;include quite a good application for free with the Windows XP install.  urlLink Movie Maker 2  is it's name and it's actually not too bad at all. I've just started to mess around with it using some .avi animations I've created in various applications and the output is fine and very easy to use.  Video editing is nothing new and I'm sure we've all seen some horror wedding video with heart shaped fades and wipes, cheesy music and garish pink titles plonked on top.&nbsp;Just as the early '90s saw the DTP revolution and everyone from the local takeaway to government departments went mad with text boxes, forty different fonts, 24 styles and colours all on the same page&nbsp;now we have the home made video.  Although the professional applications having nothing to fear from this giveaway, if your needs are modest it should fit the bill perfectly. Does anybody have any links to copyright free music that can be downloaded and added? Something ambient or similar would be good.

        My mother has now left us to return home after enjoying a week long stay. I've not been going to bed until late because she was over, and as I'm on holiday, so I feel very tired. It's also been very hot during the night which definitely doesn't help in getting restorative sleep.   Hopefully I'll get to bed early tonight and feel much better in the morning. There is a lot of work to do in the garden and I really need to strip the porch back and repaint it before the autumn comes. My mother says she has noticed a small improvement in my mood but that I obviously get very tired and "ratty" with it. There is still no word from Dr Dick, the liver specialist, so if I hear nothing by next week I will make my first claim on the private health insurance to hopefully kick them into action.

        Sometimes I'm left speechless by the capacity for shear stupidity that people display. This  urlLink news story  is about one of those people who is obviously so stupid it beggars belief they have survived this long in the world.  urlLink Darwin  would never have come up with his evolutionary theories if he was around in the present day.   This story has one of the most perfect, understated quotes I've seen in a long time. I wonder if the interviewer was, even slightly, tempted to shout back "No love, there isn't a 'Debt Personality', you're just as thick as pig sh*t!".    I often wonder if there is such a thing as a 'debt personality'      I have zero sympathy for the credit card companies who continually try and trap these idiots with their wares. But at the end of the day it's me who pays for it, with high interest rate charges to keep the fools who end up bankrupt out of jail and the credit card company's profits rolling in.

        I've long since lusted after the thought of using a multi-monitor setup for my work. The purchase of  urlLink the Beast  with a dual DVI capable graphics card has brought this dream a step closer. As my work is CAD based I still intend to use a CRT as&nbsp;the main monitor and add a LCD screen as the second. For absolute precision, colour rendering and speed the CRT is king. Hopefully this will result in a 19" main monitor at 1600x1200 and a 17" LCD at 1280x1024. Oh yes, feel the width!   Check out this sad  urlLink geek site  which has a gallery of multi-monitor setups.

        One of my responsibilities in the new business will be the creation and maintenance of our Company's web presence. Now, while I have an eye for design, I'm no professional graphic designer. This, allied to the fact that the creation of a site from scratch can be a very long process, that is even before you start to add the content, I have taken a corporate decision that we will purchase a ready built website template. This can then be modified to suit our needs more exactly. Research into available templates for sale only goes to justify this decision even more.   Very high quality templates can be bought for a such a low price (arround $60)&nbsp;that one wonders why anybody would spend the time and effort creating&nbsp;a site&nbsp;from scratch. These templates include all the Photoshop, flash, fonts and html files required for customisation. Check out the  urlLink SSI-Developer  and&nbsp; urlLink DesignGalaxy  sites for examples and prices. Also available&nbsp;are complete corporate packages including logo, business cards, stationery, Powerpoint templates etc.   While many of the designs are not to my taste, there are so many that eventually you'll find something that can be utilised as the template for your own site. At the very least it is good for researching colour schemes and layout styles.

       It has been a couple of weeks since the last update on my forthcoming business empire so it's time for a progress report.   My business partner had a meeting, last week,&nbsp;with the  urlLink Angus Small Business Gateway  to pitch the initial idea, find out what support they could give us and most importantly what grants are available. Their reply was less than helpful. Basically they won't comment on individual business ideas but will support you to write a business plan, they won't put you in touch with local businesses who may be able to help,&nbsp;and as for grants, well... there aren't any!! So what exactly does the taxpayer get for funding this organisation? Feck all as far as I can determine. Am I dreaming, for I'm sure every budget for the last 20 years bangs on about creating an entrepreneurial environment for the creation of wealth generating businesses. Now if we were some billion dollar, multinational company wanting to set up here they'd be falling over themselves to throw cash at us. Get a plant built for free, no taxes for 3 years and then shut the place down and bugger off to the next country with huge incentives. Added to this is the fact that my Business Partner is now classed as "long term unemployed", had his benefit stopped and still there is no help. Ridiculous.  So, as I suspected, it's up to us. In the long run it'll be for the best but you can't help feeling there is a lot of money wasted in funding these organisations that are supposed to support new business creation. At best they are completely cosmetic and at worst they are a total hindrance to people who want to create local jobs for local people (and get filthy rich, only joking).

       It surprising how quickly you forget how to do something when you haven't done it for a while. I'm in the middle of installing a new hard drive on my general workhorse computer. Getting it&nbsp;fitted into the machine&nbsp;with the right master jumper setting, firing it up, formatting a system partition and installing Win2K went pretty smoothly.   It was then I realised it hadn't detected the existing slave drive (containing very valuable data). Much fruitless fiddling about within the BIOS failed to make the drive appear in Windows. It was then I swallowed all pride and consulted the help files. Disk Manager... oh yeah... I forgot about that. Sure enough my drive was there but marked as "foreign". A quick click here and there and all was well. Fired up explorer to check if the data was all intact and I'm smiling once again.   All that is left is to format the remaining 55Gb on the new drive (handy extra storage) install Norton Ghost and copy over my clean and patched Win2K ghost image with all the correct hardware drivers and network settings.

         As a result of my "strange behaviour" mentioned recently I have taken delivery of&nbsp;a new&nbsp;phone to replace&nbsp;the SonyEricsson T68i (which took a soaking down the toilet).   As you can see from the picture it's a lovely  urlLink SonyEricsson T610  on Orange. Very smart. First impressions are good. It's actually slightly smaller than the old phone but the screen is twice the size. Included on the phone is a nifty little camera plus all the usual goodies such as Bluetooth etc. The only downside I can see at the moment is the lack of the Naval Command game (Battleships) which&nbsp;filled my regular afternoon break sitting on the toilet trying to sink a sub (ooh err... did you see what I did there? Comedy). Modesty forbids me commenting on the battery (I design rechargeable batteries for a living) but suffice to say if you need a spare one for a T610 then give us a shout.   All that is left for me is to wonder if my laptop will fit down the pan in the same way, and whether I'd get away with it.

        "Education, education, education"... so said our illustrious leader laying out&nbsp;what his&nbsp;government's priorities would be if they got into power. They did, and standards have continued&nbsp;to fall, started by that bitch Thatcher, unabated. So, if you can't get a decent education here how about tapping into MIT's (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) excellent  urlLink OpenCourseWare  site, a free and open educational resource for faculty, students, and self-learners around the world. OCW supports MIT's mission to advance knowledge and education, and serve the world in the 21st century. They've got the lecture notes, assignments, reading lists, exams etc for over 700 courses spread across 33 faculties. You can't claim to be a MIT undergraduate and obviously there is no certificate at the end of it but the information supplied is an excellent resource for self learning.  &nbsp;    a free and open educational resource for faculty, students, and self-learners around the world. OCW supports MIT's mission to advance knowledge and education, and serve the world in the 21st century    Of most interest to me is the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering courses but there is such a huge range of topics that you're bound to find something that is to your liking. To make it just like the real thing&nbsp;turn on Countdown, make a cup of tea,&nbsp;fire up the PC and spend the next 6 hours playing Doom and Descent... ah, happy days.

       In light of the hard drive failure suffered during the week I've been giving much thought to my future data backup requirements, not just from a business point of view but personal as well.  &nbsp;  My current employer suffered a devastating fire just over 3 years ago. Our 10,000sq feet building was completely gutted in about 15 minutes. Luckily no-one was injured in the stampede to get away from the flames. The nature of the business meant we had large amounts of nasty chemicals that in the right (wrong) conditions would explode, and they did, anyway I digress. At the time the building was also home to the R&amp;D department for the whole worldwide organisation. The data we had stored on the servers was irreplaceable and would have ended the business if we could not support our customers on their current development projects let alone the history of current and&nbsp;previous products in production. As fate would have it the IT manager was on holiday and the daily backups had been left to a mere minion to manage the tapes and store them offsite. The conversation went something like this...  &nbsp;  BOFH: Where was the last backup tape?  PFY: In the tape drive.  BOFH: Where were the previous backup tapes?  PFY: In the server room.  BOFH: In the fire safe?  PFY: No.  &nbsp;  I'll not go into the finer details of what followed but we did manage to locate the fire damaged&nbsp;servers, pull the hard disks and rip the data. A previous set of backup tapes were found and in all we lost maybe a days worth of data.  &nbsp;  All this, as you can imagine, was a sobering experience and one I fully intend to learn from when we get our business up and running. So what should I propose as a backup procedure? I'll have to think about that. Cost will be an issue, as the procedure will also plan for hardware failure requiring redundancy of actual computers etc. This one HD failure means I can't access the data on the perfectly good slave drive. This would lead me to thinking of an external HD for backup or even network storage so that it could be moved from machine to machine if required. All critical data (current projects) will not only be stored on 2 separate machines but backuped daily as well to the external HD.&nbsp;Older&nbsp;data would be stored on the external HD as well as archived and stored offsite on CDs or DVDs. All this for a small 2 man company hopelessly reliant on IT. Makes you think if there isn't a business opportunity to offer low cost IT support for similar small companies that don't have the time or skills to do it for themselves. They are left to fend for themselves probably relying on some family member who has a PS2 but knows all about computers. Hmmm... this will be how these small companies get their godawful websites too.  &nbsp;  I was BTs&nbsp;Broadband campaigner for my area which gave me some exposure to the total lack of thought people give to data backup, online security from viruses and worms etc. Businesses whose existence depends on IT but who have no procedure to protect themselves from disaster and most of them are running on Windows98! The mind boggles.

         Haven't done one of these in a while, can't really explain why. Not feeling too bad considering all the things that seem to be going wrong at the moment (computer, microwave etc). I'm definitely in need of a break and my forthcoming week off is much anticipated. The house will be surrounded by builders replacing the roofline all that week so hopefully that will force me to go out and about with Lesley enjoying ourselves doing things that normal people do.  As a sign that I'm in desperate need of the holiday I've been doing some really strange things lately. For instance, I threw my mobile phone down the toilet at work ?!!? I didn't mean to, I just did. If you were to replay the incident on tape it would look to all intents and purposes that I did it deliberately. Another symptom of CFS is what is sometimes referred to as "Brain Fog" where you just can't seem to focus or think straight, that's all I can put it down to. Very strange. Still, I'm getting a shiny new phone out of it from the work, which is nice.

       The windows system hard drive on ye olde Win2K Athlon 700 machine has just died horribly. Although the  urlLink Beast  is computer number 1, I wanted to keep it shielded from the evils of the internet at least until Windows XP SP2 was finally released. To this end the Athlon was still my primary machine for the web and e-mail. I will have lost a couple of weeks of e-mail which is annoying but not disastrous. All my data is stored on another hard drive within the Athlon so I should be able to pull it and access the gigabytes of information I have stored.  This is my first hard drive failure in 15 years of computer ownership and I suppose that makes me lucky. If we get the business up and running I will have to seriously look at our IT disaster recovery procedure. Thinking about it I know where I can get my hands on a 40/80Gb DLT... hmmm. They'd never miss it, uses a SCSI interface so more cash outlay would be required.  Makes me wonder though. How much data do I have stored and what would I do if it was all to be lost? *shudder* what a horrible thought.

        Regular readers of this rubbish may remember  urlLink this post  in which I proposed the theory that women couldn't think laterally when the prospect of buying shiny new kitchen appliances was in the mix. I  may  have been wrong.  As I sit here through a fog of choking black smoke I have to report that the microwave in question exploded in flames this evening at approximately 7:30PM. I suspect the fault that Lesley mentioned in passing may have had something to do with this little incident or the fact that I put a tasty Tesco Premium Sticky Toffee Pudding at full blast for 10 minutes (the other numbers on the keypad fixed themselves a while back) and walked off. Lying on the sofa, gob salivating as the smell of perfectly melted toffee filled the air a tiny little thought filled my head...was that burning I could smell?  I can't continue, I'm too overcome... Lesley is already eyeing the Argos catalogue again, I'll have to go and lie down for a bit. In the meantime please entertain yourselves by visiting  urlLink We-Man!s Funny things to do with a microwave  page. Hey, let's be careful out there and pay more attention to your woman when she's waving the Argos catalogue under your nose.

        Like a scene from a war film in the 1950's I will be receiving a food parcel, not from the Red Cross though, but from my mother. She's coming over from Norn Iron to Scotland for a visit (the real reason is actually a Tom Jones' concert at Edinburgh Castle in a couple of weeks but she needs somewhere to stay) and the cost of a bed is as much Veda bread and spuds she can get in the car.  Scotland is a marvelous place to live, only three things let it down. Terrible potatoes, crap bread and Scottish Country Dancing. I have long since despaired at the state of Scotland's potatoes. Wet, soapy, tasteless crap, an insult to a proper spud. A spud should be firm, dry and floury. It should absorb the butter and, for a new potatoes, a dash of Lea and Perrins... ahh the joy.  Bread, now there is an excuse, for not knowing what proper bread is as we like to keep that a secret, much the same as the Danes and Heineken, we don't like to see it go. The finest bread comes from Norn Iron and don't believe anything else you hear. Soda bread, Wheaten farls, barnbrack... *sigh* and the biggest secret of all, Veda Bread, from the  urlLink Ormo Bakery  no less. Cut it thin with tomato and cheese as sandwiches, cut it thick for toast and marmalade (Lemon and Lime only, mind). I constantly hear rumours that M&S are importing the Veda but I've never witnessed it on the shelves. It is a dream I have that one day everybody will be as fortunate as those who hail from home.

        The legend of King Arthur has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. Hollywood has dabbled with the story on numerous occasions and all of them, with one exception, have been a complete disaster. Now, the biggest budget retelling of  urlLink King Arthur  is about to be unleashed. I have my doubts. Clive Owen as Arthur? Hmm.... I've seen the trailers and to say his acting style is wooden and voice monotonous would be to put it very kindly. Keria Knightley is present as Guinevere... we like Keria, but I don't think her charm will change my opinion. The first reviews seem positive but then they're paid to be that way. Will I go and see it? Probably, for I am Arthur.  For me the greatest telling of Arthurian Legend is John Boorman's  urlLink Excalibur . How I love this film. Based on Sir Thomas Malory's 15th Century novel, Le Morte d'Arthur it is a cracking film with all the   classic elements of the legend included. Yes, it's relatively low budget, yes it's as historically inaccurate as you could possibly get, yes Nicol Williamson "hams" it up outrageously as Merlin... trust me, it is just fantastic.  If you want a more historically accurate and seemingly well researched version you could do a lot worse than check out Bernard Cornwell's trilogy of novels,  urlLink The Warlord Chronicles  beginning with The Winter King, Enemy of God and finally Excalibur.

         Never having really succumbed to the geek side of computing it had always been my intention to refrain from anything open source. "How could it be any good?", I'd think. If it was as good as it's authors seemed to think it was then surely they'd charge cold, hard cash for their efforts, and so I remained in blissful ignorance of probably the greatest piece of open source software out there, Blender. That was until a few months ago when I saw Blender featured in a magazine.    The power of this program is truly amazing, matched only by it's speed of development.   It just so happened I was on the lookout for a powerful 3D modelling and rendering package capable of creating professional images and animations. All the usual suspects had been researched and evaluated. TrueSpace, 3D Studio Max, Lightscape etc. All were horrendously expensive and difficult to use. As a Mechanical Design Engineer 3D modelling holds no fear for me, therefore it was really the scene creation, lighting, material setup and animation capabilities that were of interest.  I discovered that Blender had a growing following of 3D artists, mainly attracted by the zero cost but equally to the huge, friendly support community built around it. The power of this program is truly amazing, matched only by it's speed of development. Rarely a month goes by without a new update release with even more powerful features added. It does have a reputation for having, what is described as, an "unusual user interface" but I must confess I have found it very easy to get used to. Admittedly, I do not use the modelling features but prefer to import from another package to Blender for scene setting and rendering. There are numerous blender scenes (.blend) available and tutorials to get you started (just do a google for Blender). The best source of information can be found on the  urlLink Elysiun Forums .  The home page for the entire project development can be found at the  urlLink Blender.org  site and the latest builds can be downloaded for a variety of operating systems at the  urlLink Blender3D.org  site. Give it a go. I fully intend to implement Blender as one of the key software packages for my "soon" to be revealed Business venture.

       My head is spinning with ideas and plans for my business venture. Everywhere I look I see another opportunity connected to the main idea. The more I think about it the more I believe it is viable.  My former colleague, and possible business partner, has started to make the first steps into getting the planning in place. He attended a free seminar for start-ups run by our local  urlLink Business Gateway  (Tayside, Scotland) about marketing and intends to go to a few more.  I have a week off coming up and plan to concentrate on getting samples of the sort of work we intend to do completed.

         New  urlLink research  from the UK into children with CFS reveals they should exercise more and not lie about being ill all day. While I have no doubt as to the validity of the research I would make one suggestion. The person who came up with this conclusion has never suffered from CFS. It's all very well saying to someone to stop lying about and get up and do some exercise, but when you feel as shit as I do sometimes (and I am clearly suffering only a mild version) you can hardly move for the pain nevermind do some exercise no matter how graded it may be.

        Very tired today at work as I think the weather was getting to me, and Lesley had a restless night which means I didn't sleep as well as I needed to. Nothing much else to report. Dr Dick has yet to contact me (must be a common trait among similarly named folk, eh?  urlLink Ian .. I said... oh nevermind).  As I've been unwell for some time I took up the offer of Private Health Insurance from the work. They may be crap but we do get good perks. Amazingly they zero your medical records upon joining which means I can get treatment for conditions existing prior to my entering the scheme. Result! So if Dr. Dick remains conspicuous with his silence I'll call in the policy. I'll bet that'll buck him up a bit.  I don't fully agree with Private Health Insurance, but as I'm taxed through the nose for the NHS, but always seem to be permanently on a 6 month waiting list, I have given in. As a bonus Lesley is also covered but only for new conditions arising since the date of joining the policy (after 2 years though she'll be fully covered too).

        Nick Mason, that's him on the left of a very rare 5 man Floyd picture circa 1968, erstwhile drummer of the long dead band will release his memoirs  urlLink "Inside Out - A Personal History of Pink Floyd"  in September. I love this picture not just because of the rarity of showing Dave Gilmour and Syd Barrett at the same time but the poetry of it. Syd gazing to the stars, having already begun to lose his battle with drugs and descending into a schizophrenic wreck, Roger looking in a completely different direction and Nick, Dave and Rick staring straight at the camera. Sums up exactly what would happen to the band in later decades.  Rumours of Nick's scribblings have been circulating for years but suspicion fell on fat d*ve as the main sticking point to it's publication. Allegedly he was unhappy that the book would be of Nick's opinion only (fat d*ve was never the brightest plectrum in the guitar case).  I don't like fat d*ve! Fat d*ve for those who don't know was the Floyd's one time guitarist. After Roger decided to leave the band in 1986, fat d*ve, with one eye on his pension, decided to keep the band going. What followed were 2 horrendously bad studio albums, 2 embarrassingly successful world tours and 2 stinking live albums. Roger Waters was, is and for ever will be Pink Floyd, and he was displeased.  So why, for me, is Roger Waters the man? Well, setting aside the fact that he wrote all the bands greatest albums, designed the stage shows, influenced the LP artwork etc he is well known for being a complete bastard to work with and a grumpy old git to boot, QED, he is, therefore, my God.  Expectations are high for a thoroughly cracking read as witnessed from the drum stool of every Pink Floyd gig ever (the only ever present member of the band in a history spanning 40 years). Spinal Tap will, I suspect, have nothing on the true goings on from the murky depths of London in 1965, through the dawn of Pyschedelia to the emergence of one of Rock's greatest song writers. I smell early Christmas present.

        The latest set of blood test results are in and they continue to show an abnormally high level of some type of enzymes in my Liver.   The Doctor asked if I was a drinker, but I don't touch it anymore. I gave up alcohol long ago as it would completely destroy me for days after. First I cut down to a few drinks when I was out but still awoke to a raging hangover, then I cut it down to one drink and would act as the driver, but still I would suffer a horrendous hangover the following day. So I now steer well clear of it. As alcohol consumption can be ruled out of the equation the medical establishment are at a loss to explain. I don't get the impression it is anything life threatening but it does make you worry.  The hospital consultant wants me to see a Liver specialist for further investigation. He goes by the name of Doctor Dick apparently. "Paging Doctor Dick"... wasn't that in some crap sitcom? Stop sniggering at the back there.

         Feeling really tired today but that is all my fault. I got up "early" yesterday morning and I didn't go to bed until very late. Consequently I've been struggling to catch up all day. The exhaustion caused by ME/CFS means that it is not possible to overdo it without consequences. If you use energy you haven't stored previously, you will suffer for it. I'm off to bed now and I suspect I'll be fit for nothing tomorrow and will need another early night.

        Again, connected in part to my new business enterprise I have been re-evaluating my approach to online security. This has resulted in 2 changes.  Firstly I have been trying out the  urlLink FireFox 0.9.1  internet browser. Initial impressions are good. It does appear to me as a little slower than Microsoft's IE6 (on my Athlon 700Mhz machine) though, but by no means to the extent of rendering it as unusable. I like it's plain simple layout and the use of "Tabbed" browsing is a real boon. Hopefully it will be more secure than the security hole riddled carcass that is IE6.  Secondly, I have availed myself of my current employer's generous free copy of  urlLink McAfee's VirusScan Enterprise  for use on employee's home computers. I say free but as we have over 130,000 employee's worldwide I'm sure McAfee are making a tidy packet on the licensing of our work computers (or maybe not as most of our jobs have moved to China where software piracy is practically the law).

         As I have been mulling over the idea of setting up in business for quite some time now, I was on the look out for a new workstation class computer capable of running MCAD and DCC applications. These are generally specialist machines with the prices tending to err on the side of obscene. I had concluded that I would have to satisfy myself with building a reasonable machine at a more manageable price tag. That was until I acted upon a tip off from a friend about  urlLink Dell's Outlet Store .  Dell are not usually a company that I would think of as offering value for money. Their adverts all very smart and glossy with good prices etc but when you dig down the true cost of the computer with VAT, delivery and essential upgrades added is usually pretty expensive. As for their Workstations they are vastly overpriced. But, as Dell's big selling point is that they "build to order", the problem they have is when a deal falls through and the computer is returned they're stuck? They can't sell it on as a new machine so what do they do? They sell it off at a discount on their  urlLink Dell Outlet Page  as a refurbished machine even though it comes packaged and guaranteed as new.  One lazy Friday afternoon, after a returning from a Pizza Hut buffet lunch (this was a few weeks ago before my healthy eating plan kicked in), I logged on to see what deals they had on Workstations. Lo and behold up popped a beast of a machine at a fantastic 1300UKP less than it would cost as new. I suspect I had lucked out and found an error in their pricing. The machine was 552UKP (ex. VAT) and I'm pretty sure it should have been 1552UKP (ex. VAT) as a similar spec of computer was a 1000 quid more on the same page. Out came the credit card and a couple of minutes later the order was placed.  A stressful few days later, in which the order was processed and confirmed (would they realise their mistake and cancel my order?) and the notice of shipping was confirmed. Exactly one week after placing the order it was delivered (for free) to my door. Oh the unmitigated joy!  So, here it sits. A Dell Precision 360 Workstation P4 3.06Ghz with HT on a 800Mhz FSB, 2Gb DDR 400Mhz RAM, 120Gb SATA HD, DVD Drive, Keyboard, Mouse and the piece de resistance... a NVIDIA 128Mb Quadro4 Dual DVI FX1000 Workstation class OpenGL compliant video card (worth 400+ quid on its own) and a full copy, including CD, of WinXP Professional, and 3 year guarantee... all for the princely sum of 662 quid, Oh yes! Read it an weep.

        Well, it looks like my business empire is finally going to become a reality. As I've said before, a former colleague is all fired up about the business idea I put to him. He is going to pull together all the numerous strands of thought, scraps of information and ad hoc research that I've been doing for months. Regular updates as to the progress of our budding enterprise will follow.  How long have I dreamed of quitting the rat race? Too long. How much do I hate the incompetence of managers that are a blight on the face of British industry? Too much. The time has come to stop digging other people holes and dig some for myself. The saddest part of the whole thing is that my business idea is not engineering related. Engineering skills are no longer appreciated in this country and we will all suffer in the long run for it. Mark my words, I remember a comment made on the Money Programme years ago from a respected foreign economist who when asked to comment on Thatcher's (spit) insane drive to turn Britain into a service economy was to ask "How long can you hope to do other peoples dirty washing?" Bitch Thatcher destroyed the vast majority of our manufacturing industry and now her tory boy, MBA waving, managers are destroying what little remains.

         Glasgow is my fourth most favourite city in all the world, I like to think of it as Belfast with knives instead of guns. For those of you who have never been, or those that miss the place then get yourself over to the  urlLink Glasgow Survival Guide  for some pure dead brilliant entertainment, quality man.  Check out the  urlLink toy section  and learn the lingo from the purple nedosaur, personal favourites are V, B, P and Bazza Ferguson's very own, F. I just love the Glesga banter. See if you can spot the git that mugged you in the  urlLink gallery of Neds  and be prepared for the next time by choosing a  urlLink weapon  of your very own.

        Back at work for a couple of days now. I was very tired last night and had to go to bed early. Amazing how just a week away from the place and your body shuts down into holiday mode so quickly. I'm off again next week for 3 days so I'll start to ease back tomorrow as Friday approaches. Bonus this week is that the boss is on holiday. Nice. Still no word from the hospital consultant about investigating my blood results. Hmmm. Other than that feeling OK.

        urlLink   The start of a new, hopefully regular, feature whereby I will attempt to inject some culture into the lives of my millions of readers.  Music is something which used to play a very important part in my life. Those difficult teenage years (which lasted well into my thirties) were soundtracked by many artists and songs and studied in great depth while lying on my bed with the hi-fi blaring. Today, music is something that is listened to on the go, in a highly compressed format whether it be the radio, MP3s, TV or whatever. I've lost the joy of listening to music. It is something I intend to remedy sometime in the future. Yes readers, I have once again contracted the most deadliest of diseases, more commonly known as the Hi-Fi bug. Nothing on earth can reduce a man to a quivering, penniless wreck than the thought of Hi-Fi. I used to be seriously into Hi-Fi and once possessed a decent set-up (2 grands worth around 1987). Strangely my interest declined when I actually started working as a Design Engineer for a world leading British loudspeaker company. Sitting in the R&amp;D demo room listening to roughly 80,000 quids worth of top gear I realised I'd never posses anything as good as that, and the bug was exorcised from my body. I content myself now listening to CDs or MP3s on the computer, or the radio in the car but never do I sit down and listen to music, eyes shut drinking in every nuance of audio pleasure. This will have to change.  And so to the point of this post. Hi-Fi food. Music. I count myself as one of the fortunate ones. My taste in music has been formed over many years, each purchase thoughtfully researched and studied. As a result my taste is impeccable. I will dispense this advice now[1].  There is an advert on at the moment, I don't know what it's advertising as the music it contains causes me to drift off to a bygone age when I was young. The Undertones (My Perfect Cousin). The joy. You'll know their greatest hit "Teenage Kicks" and rightfully it is regarded as a complete classic by many including John Peel who names it as the greatest ever. So my first lesson in your musical education is buy  urlLink The Best of the Undertones (Teenage Kicks) . They're all there: My Perfect Cousin, Teenage Kicks, Here Comes the Summer, Mars Bars etc.   I can't listen to it now without getting all dewy-eyed. And if I play it on the radio, I have to segue it into the front of another record because I can't speak after I've heard it." JOHN PEEL on 'TEENAGE KICKS    I challenge anybody not to love this. While you're at it check out the  urlLink Official Undertones  website. 30 second clips of all the songs can be found there along with great quotes from celebs on the music.  [1] Bonus point for recognising the reference.
