      My friend Adam and I always talk about doing things we never end up doing. Since, of the two of us, I am the one who once in a while gets things done, I decided to start the blog without much consulting. He probably won't like the design much and it is likely, once he sees I have actually done it (started the blog), his interest in having a blog will subside (i.e. his excitement and sense of possibility will be replaced by fears/anxieties/reservations about how lame and unoriginal it is to have a blog, how everyone has one, how we (Adam and I) don't really have any original ideas to contribute to the world, etc.) These are all convincing arguments. I'm mostly convinced by them. But sometimes, even still, you have to just do something, so you can make sure it's unoriginal and lame and stupid, etc. So you know  from experience   that you have nothing to offer. Let's look at it that way, Adam: let's look at this as a chance to find out if we have nothing to offer. Then, when it turns out to be true (that we have nothing to offer), we can declare the whole blog project a success. Now, I'm going to send you this and you're going to have to start contributing. Come on, we both know there are times at work we think something really cool but don't want to share it with anyone. Now we can do it--write it down-- before  we realize it's really not that cool or funny or original (what we thought). Okay, I'm gonna' publish this now. My first blog post. So far, I kinda like it.

       Category: Culture?   As usual, Tuesday night's  urlLink Real World  finale was a disappointment--the final episodes always are. I didn't cry and I didn't laugh, and although I liked the San Diego group while they were around, I can't imagine I'm going to miss any of them a great deal. I don't know, it's been a long time since a Real World character was actually capable of saying anything original under the massively preconditioned melodrama churned out by the last show--even Jacquese, the smartest guy that's been on there for awhile, retreated into cliches about the cast members being "like family" and the value of "getting to know different kinds of people...dealing with situations," last night.  MTV's big promo for the finale was we'd get to see Robin go to court and defend herself against the charge she mauled a marine at a bar. In fact, this just turned out to be another "great learning experience" (I don't know how the Real World cast members manage to  learn so much --where do they keep all of it?) compared to the real legal battle that beset San Diego, which involves the alleged  urlLink rape of a drunk girl  by one of Randy's friends in the house. Some mainstream media outlets excoriated Real World producers for not showing something about the rape. They're right, sort of, but not really.  There are, of course, plenty of  urlLink legitimate gripes  to be leveled at The Real World, which is not the show it once was (for proof, read " urlLink Boob Tube, " by Benjamin Wallace-Wells about The Real World's downward trajectory over the last decade), but given what the show has become, no one should be surprised the producers decided not to show a rape that actually took place in the house. Basically, I think producers follow the rules of your average freshman dorm: you know--eating disorders, alcoholism, depression, suicide attempts, heartfelt confessions of insecurity about one's identity: totally in bounds. Rape, actual violence, real drug addiction, sexual abuse, heavy literature: not really the right place or time.  I also wonder if the whole hidden rape episode could serve as a kind of metaphor for the broader  urlLink Abercrombie & Fitch sexuality  that increasingly pervades the culture of show: half-naked frollicking between good-looking, clean-cut, suburbanly bred white kids is on camera, but rape is off. So is actual sex, of course, despite all the camera's powers of insinuation. This is a little like the dynamic you find in the  urlLink Abercrombie & Fitch yearly catalogue  , (definitely click that link), available at a store near you. The paradox, I think, is that that whole liefstyle (the frat-boy, get wasted, play football without shirt or shoes, scream a lot lifestyle) really wouldn't be so alluring if it weren't for the idea that kids living it are always having such great, clean-cut sex--but this is just the part that's always left  out  of popular depictions of them, as on Real World San Diego.  Oh well, this post is getting pretty disjointed. It's hard for me to focus on just one thing when I get going on Real World. The point is, I can't wait for Philadelphia.

       Category: Fiction   Laura Miller's  urlLink review of  Oblivion   for Salon today is by far the best review I've read of Wallace's new collection. Placed as the lead story for Salon's page, the review turned a rare book review trick: it made me want to read the book again. Miller pulls off the impressive feat of thematically unifying a collection of stories which seem at first glance only loosely connected--she believes Wallace is writing a "particularly subtle form of horror story -- so subtle, in fact, that to judge from the book's reviews, few of his readers even realize that's what these stories are."  "Judging" other reviews is a big part of Miller's article, but it's warranted because so many of the reviews of  Oblivion  have been so silly, if not willfully ignorant. Miller understands, for instance, that Wallace doesn't use footnotes to be annoying, or "as mere postmodern smart-alecking." He uses them, and other grammatical devices, because "he wants to show how a great web of inchoate feelings and trains of thought and immanent understandings of multiple situations is operating in any person at any point in time. The breadth of human consciousness can never be squeezed through the narrow aperture offered by one word at a time without distortion or oversimplification or, basically, the expenditure of lots and lots of 'English.'"   This part of Miller's review is extrapolated from the collection's best story,  Good Old Neon , but could be about almost anything in Wallace's fiction. It's nice to see a reviewer actually consider what Wallace "wants to show," rather than merely using Wallace as an instrument in what  they  want to show--you know, about  urlLink culture, postmodernism , their own  urlLink genius as reviewers . I think this is the difference between actually reviewing a book and just showing off that one  can  review a book.

       Category: Culture   Last week, Katie Couric had Larry King on The Today Show to promote his new book  urlLink Taking on Heart Disease .    After a few minutes of amiable PR, Couric took the interview to a more somber place: Mattie Stepanek, child poet and close friend of King, had died the night before of muscular dystrophy.  He was 13.  (Media analysis note: every story on Stepanek includes this terse reminder of his early end. He was 13. To the contemporary American mind, the poet who died young was not Keats, Shelley, or Byron, but the author of  Journey Through Heartsongs ,  Loving Through Heartsongs ,  Celebrate Through Heartsongs ,  Hope Through Heartsongs , and of course  Heartsongs .) Three of his older brothers and sisters had died from the disease in their early childhood, and Mattie himself had nearly died a few times from medical complications. King said a few words about what a miracle Mattie was and what a blessing it was to have him here on earth for this long and then Couric led them into break.  Here's a synopsis of the first commercial: Mom in 1976 looks at son hitting himself in head with plastic bat.  Boy then runs into plastic corner, falls down plastic stairs, etc.  Mom rolls here eyes, says something I couldn't make out.  Next shot is the son, all grown up now (2004).  He's got a daughter, running around the house, hitting herself in head with plastic toys, falling down into plastic objects.  Grown-up son rolls his eyes, says " It's a wonder she made it to ten ."  (Banner runs across the screen, something like "Plastics make us safer.")  Somewhere in TV Land, a secretary blanched, an executive picked up the phone, and a producer wilted.   For about a week then, my ears were pricked to the world of advertising, specifically to the question of whether that world can ever entertain such thing as a coincidence.   In the Business section of Monday's "Early Edition: Iraq Transfer" NYT, you may have noticed a Nat Ives article, " urlLink Rain or Shine, Win or Lose, This Ad is Just for You ."  As you know, advertisers have failed to adequately micro-manage our purchases, and have done a woeful job responding to demographic fluctuations.  The solution is in the works. "Ultimately, national broadcasts could feature different advertising for every different segment of the audience. For viewers, it would mean their cable box can tell which team they are rooting for and, based on the outcome, show them the most appropriate commercial."  It won't be long before the ads are tailored to specific neighborhoods. (United, in the final throes of bankruptcy, has already tested ads which address individual cities, offering both "Chicago, Say Hello to Ted" and "Arlington Heights, Say Hello to Ted."  Ted being United's new, youth-oriented airline.  By the way, if you want to see targeted advertising at work, pay attention to the hipsters featured in the Independence Airlines ads on DC Metro walls.  That's us--interns and young professionals looking for a place to plug in the ole' I-Pod during our flight to Illadelph for wacky cheesesteak hijinks.)  Is this advertising a problem? I can hardly tell, I'm so inured to electronic monitoring, but I bet the ACLU thinks so.  Remember the fuss raised when those  urlLink listening billboards  premiered out West?  They can figure out what station is most popular among a given segment of drivers and change the billboard display to best reflect the consumer interests of that demographic.  (That demographic's consumer interests having been previously determined with the help of  urlLink The Media Audit .)  And of course there's the recent concern over Google's AdSense Program: a computer algorithm (not a human! point out IPO-hungry Google execs) scans your Gmail messages and performs "the matching of ads to content."  Proving, once and for all, that the medium is the message.   Targeted advertising can be scary.  Why doesn't it scare me?  I agree with the ACLU on most every cause they take up, but I'm not at all concerned about the possibility that advertisers (or even corporations) have access to information which allows them to zero in on my consumer interests.  This has to do, no doubt, with the fact that I've always had my personal data submitted or sequestered by electronic means.  I don't even pause anymore when giving out my name (nevermind my social security number) over the internet.  I happily tell customer service technicians what my favorite color is or what hospital I was born in.  Gmail's privacy concerns will not cause many young people to hesitate because we are not used to being concerned about our privacy.  And, I think, partly, we would rather be subjected to targeted advertising than not.   Consider spam.  Think of those unsolicited, grapeshot emails from The Better Health Store, promoting new products to increase your libido, or access to Mexican pharmacies, or porn sites.  These ads are so annoying because they're not targeted; for the most part, they promote products my demographic is nointeresteded.  Car ads are annoying for the same reason--TV viewing would be inestimably improved if people who were in the market for a new car were the only ones who had to watch trucks crawl over rubble or sedans swerve through European allies during every commercial break.  Salesmen are irritating, and anachronistic, for the same reason--in the modern advertising world, with Carnivore-like technology sifting through consumer demographics, there's no excuse for showing up on a college kid's doorstep offering a box of deluxe knives he'll never want.    In fact, the average viewer's familiarity with the demographic gradations advertisers rely upon is already so nuanced that one can triangulate one's own position on the consumer interest map simply by paying attention to the ads.  If you see a lot of truck ads, you found the channel for the ballgame, but it's on break.  If you see an ad for I-pod, it's probably because the show you're watching is aimed at other culturally informed twenty and thirty somethings like you who have been debating getting one for a few months.  My point is that all advertising (all good advertising) is already targeted.  Where else but eye-scanning and station-eavesdropping could we have expected advertising to go in the 21st century?  Isn't this its next, natural evolution?    [Hopefully, the most conservative my posts ever get.]

       Category: Culture/Personal    With Dale Peck's new book,  urlLink Hatchet Jobs  , reviewers and critics are engaging anew in a debate that was boring the first time: basically whether book reviews should be allowed to be vicious or not, and then whether or not the proliferation of vicious book reviews proffer apocalypse  urlLink for our culture . Just once, I'd like to see someone quote Peck's line about Rick Moody being the worst writer of his generation and then actually discuss whether he's right or not, rather than going off on a long abstract discussion of whether such a statement is rhetorically "okay." Of course, that and other of Peck's statement don't really lend themselves to constructive discussion, which is one of the reasons it's so annoying that people keep discussing them.   Anyway, any  urlLink discussion of Peck  generally includes an obligatory mention of the long sanctimonious article Heidi Julavits (who is  urlLink really hot ) wrote for The Believer, the essay magazine put out by Dave Eggers' wife, last fall. In that essay Julavitz made a vague argument nobody has really been able to pin down regarding something having to do with a word she popularized called "snark" and trends in modern book reviewing. A good article in  urlLink Newsday  today about Peck's book mentions that article and puts it in its place (it's this quote that made me want to write this post).   You see, I've been bothered for a long time by the bullying, um,  sweetness  of the McSweeney's project and the annoying, well, kind of kidlike openness they act like they're practicing all the time on paper (this month's McSweeney's for instance, is all comics). Their cultural mode makes it sort of uncomfortable to take anything seriously or have judgements and opinions about what's really meaningful or important, or even to believe anything  is  meaningful or important. They mock that kind of stuff so easily, it seems. So anyway, maybe you have to have some experience with really big scale inferiority complexes to understand why this line, for me--someone who is interested in writing and finds the McSweeney's variety of contemporary writer stubbornly intimidating--is a little like being assured the coolest kid in highschool has a really small penis:   "Julavits was clearly unhappy at the thought of literary judgment of any sort. That attitude was consistent with the policy of the magazine's parent corporation, McSweeney's, which holds that cultural discourse should, as much as possible, resemble kindergarten: a place to gather for exciting stories and for the nurturance of self-esteem."   Wow, that was fun (and satisfying) to read. I like whoever wrote this article a lot.

       Category: Culture   I’ve heard so many commentators over the last few weeks describe Michael Moore’s  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  as "propaganda" or accede to the charge (even if they  urlLink liked the movie ) that Moore is, of course, " urlLink a propagandist ," that I decided to look up the word and see how it corresponded to the movie, which I saw over the weekend. Here are the two non-religious definitions of "propaganda" from Webster’s:   Propaganda : 1. Any systematic, widespread dissemination or promotion of particular ideas, doctrines, practices, etc. to further one’s own cause or to damage the opposing one. 2. Ideas, doctrines or allegations so spread: now often used disparagingly to connote deception or distortion  The "often used disparagingly" part in the second definition can be extended to mean "always used disparagingly" when referring to Michael Moore and his new movie. When commentators and reviewers say he is a propagandist, they are saying he is  a)  something other than a journalist—meaning, he strays from facts, and  b)  something other than an artist—meaning, he strays from truth (in the metaphysical sense), and is unconcerned with truth; his only motivation is gross political or personal gain. Such a definition denies him higher motives, including, I think, the motive of actually being concerned about the people (especially the economic class of people) he contends to be concerned about in his movies.  I think it’s impossible to know someone’s motives, but this film only vaguely corresponds to the above definition of propaganda, especially when you factor in the connotations of shallowness and gross manipulation that are indispensable to the word’s meaning today. And whether or not Moore cares about the underprivileged youths he shows confronting the Army as their only ticket out of Flint, his movie makes viewers care, which is what ought to count.   Also notice the degree to which the definition of "propaganda" depends on the means of "dissemination." An indispensable part of propaganda’s definition has to do with the way the information is presented and spread. Moore’s movie is presented as one man’s vision of events and will be spread by market forces—this is the same excuse right-wing pundits now trying to get commercials of the film cut off the air use to defend their right to push their point of view on talk radio and television. Moore, unlike said right-wingers, does not belong to the party in power nor does he own TV stations or other public media which would market his message as the truth as one finds it. Almost everyone is warned to watch Michael Moore’s movies critical, to take his message with a grain of salt.   But Fahrenheit 9/11 is less of a "message" than it is an alternate story about the last four years, a story which differs in consistent ways from the official version—what could be called the "official propaganda"—but does not depart much from facts, and only occasionally strays into editorial opinion. Further, there is no subterfuge about what Moore is doing and what his beliefs are—these have been out in the open for years. There is nothing "deceptive" about Moore’s presentation of his views…in fact, even reporters who claim Moore pastes a bunch of pictures on the screen to make conspiratorial inferences miss the point. He doesn’t infer anything—he pastes the pictures of Bush and his father meeting with Saudi dignitaries to make the point that, well, Bush and his father had and continue to have relationships with Saudi dignitaries, a reality widely unknown to most Americans.   But I’m not going to get into specifics. The point is calling Moore a propagandist is really just an attempt to belittle his status in comparison to the real propagandists, the United States Government. Almost everything the government says corresponds to both definitions of propaganda with hardly any adjustments needed. And the government certainly acknowledges no responsibility to "show both sides" of an issue—in fact, it's dogged determination to provide just one side gets semi-praised as something called "staying on message." I don’t mind that the state is a propagandist—that’s what governments do. But it’s upside down logic to accuse Moore of propaganda just because he’s promoting a minority view of things which differs from the government’s view.   If you’ve seen the movie, you know much of it is journalistic (corresponds to facts), and much of it is artistic (is moving in the wider sense). Of course, neither of these things guarantee it’s not propaganda, especially by the first definition, but by that definition A Room of One’s is feminist propaganda, and Ulysses is anti-Catholic propaganda, and 1984 is  certainly  propaganda and so on and so forth, and every artwork that contains in it a political or social point of view…it’s kind of meaningless in that way as a derogatory category.  For real propaganda you need look no further than the response to the movie: when White House spokesman Dan Bartlett called the film  urlLink "outrageously false"  before he had seen it, that was a clear-cut instance of propaganda. He was circulating as fact an opinion based on nothing but rumor for the express purpose of prejudicing the public against the movie and against the viewpoint expressed in the movie. The difference between his statement and the statement made in the film are maybe the difference between propaganda and what there is certainly some argument should be called art.

       Category: Culture   From an article on the new  urlLink Hizbollah TV , the "first Arab station to stage effective psychological warfare against Israel.":  "Lately, Al Manar has provided extensive coverage of the Shi'i uprising against the US occupation in southern Iraq. In a recent promotion to draw attention to the plight of Iraqis under US occupation, the station used a  trailer for Mel Gibson's movie 'The Passion of the Christ' to compare the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US military guards to the suffering of Jesus."   It's funny--in America,The Passion of the Christ was a commercial  for  the Bush administration. Just goes to show you, Jesus is one hell of a versatile marketing personality, maybe the best since Michael Jordan.

       Category: Personal  (I'll be doing this from now on)  For the last few days (and by "few days," I mean a month) I've been trying to figure out how to get contacts in my eyes and then how to make them stay there for the whole day and then how to get them out at the end of the day. It turns out this is extremely difficult and in many senses dangerous--I'm sure I've flirted with severely impairing my vision forever, and the words "cornea" and "scratch" have achieved a prominence in my mind I'd never expected for them.  I think putting contacts in fits into a broad category I'm going to call:  things-that-are-excruciatingly-and-almost-prohibitively-difficult-to-do-but-nobody-talks-about-them-being-difficult-and-in-fact-everyone-pretends-they're-obvious-because-(it-seems-like)-everybody-manages-to-do-them-eventually-so-they-must-not-be-that-hard.  Putting in contacts is one of these things. Sex is another. These things, because nobody acknowledges how difficult they are (unless you really question them about it, in which case you uncover whole untapped resevoirs of insecurities and frustrations), are very damaging for one's self-confidence, because while for some reason everyone acts like its some great achievment to get get good grades in school or score twenty points in a highschool basketball game, nobody applauds one for executing any of the things in the broadly defined above category, thus causing one to feel stupid/incompetent/inferior when one doesn't figure out how to do them immediately. Although one comes in contact with the highest volume of these things during puberty and the late teen years, I suspect they continue throughout life. Here's the list I could think of from my life so far (in no particular order)...  --Wearing contacts --Wearing braces (I never even had to do this, but I can just tell) --Talking to people you don't know --Driving --Driving on highways --Driving in foreign countries --Merging (in a car) --Making sure your car doesn't blow up --Legos (actually building things with them) --Shaving (without hurting yourself) --Kissing (without hurting yourself) --Getting erections at the appropriate times --Talking to people you do know --Working a five-day-a-week job --Working --Writing a hip but intelligent but not too pretentious blog --Moving (as in, to a new place) --Flying (I mean emotionally) --Not saying "like" when you talk --Breathing out of your nose (I have a feeling this one just applies to me) --Living with a girlfriend or boyfriend --Running two miles  Can people think of more? Adam?

      Christopher Hitchens really took off on  urlLink Michael Moore's new movie  in Slate yesterday. He even, I think, challenged him to some kind of fight ("Any time, Michael my boy. Let's redo Telluride. Any show. Any place. Any platform. Let's see what you're made of.") If you enjoy this sort of thing, the attack on Moore pales in comparison to the most  urlLink aggressively vicious book review  I have ever seen, written by Hitchens for the Atlantic Monthly on Sidney Blumenthal's Clinton book last year. One of the (many) funny things about Hitchens is his complete disregard for fairness or evenhandedness in his reviews, notwithstanding his denunciation of Moore for exactly that sin in Fahrenheit 9/11. I do think this is what makes him so fun to read though (just as it makes Moore's movies fun to watch). We need some liberals around who don't worry so much about fairness. You certainly don't see them tearing each other down over "the facts" on the other side.

      An anonymous author confesses in Salon:  "Being the author of several critically acclaimed, moderately successful books has given me an extraordinary, exciting, occasionally lucrative, quite public life.  It has also broken my heart ."  This is one of the  urlLink dumbest, most self-indulgent articles  I have ever seen by a (supposedly serious and critically acclaimed) writer about the writing life, and is stunning not for anything it says about the evil publishing world (none of which is the least bit suprising), but for the unstated assumptions the author clearly holds--about how easy making a living as a fiction writer is  supposed to be .  "Nothing makes me happier than writing. And, thanks to the rules that govern publishing today,  nothing I've ever done for a living  -- housecleaning, data entry, creating campaigns for big-name, cutthroat ad agencies, full-time motherhood --  has been as hard on me as being a writer .   Being an author is the culmination of a lifelong dream. And -- because the sales of each book I write determine my ability to remain one --  being an author has ruined many of my greatest lifelong pleasures ."  Poor anonymous midlist author! She's discovered being a writer and supporting yourself as a writer is hard. Could you imagine Kafka whining about stuff like this? Here's how he described--notice, he's not complaining--the sacrifices of writing:  "When it became clear in my organism that writing was the most productive direction for my being to take, everything rushed in that direction and left empty all those abilities which were directed toward the joys of sex, eating, drinking, philosophical reflection and above all music...my life has dwindled dreadfully, nor will it cease to dwindle. Nothing else will ever satisfy me"  –-Diaries, 1912-14

      More proof Slate journalists like Amsden take their cues from 60s icons like Kesey--here's an exerpt from a  urlLink 1992 interview , with Kesey. He thinks the novel is on its way out--and reaches way back to some feudal group of performers called "chopes" to describe what he thinks is coming next:   Ken Kesey : "The Chopes were writers that moved from castle to castle. The word `Chope, C-H-O-P-E,' means `see, too see, and be seen.' So you went from castle to castle and you told about the castle you just came from, and how beautiful the maidens were and how powerful and manly the knights were. You helped prop up a young civilization: They couldn't have done it without them...Now, we've got electronic means to do that, so you wouldn't have to actually travel to castles. Come out of that box, there, and address the audience. The whole MTV audience, that is the new audience. And the people who are being purists and ignoring that, are those who are going to be left behind. As Dylan says, `it's a new road; if you don't like it, get out of the way.'"   This is basically what some of the Slate writers you mention in the Arts & Life section are doing--they're Chopes. They hop from one cultural enclave to another ("castle to castle"), seeing and being seen, then use the internet ("electronic means") to convey to their young audience what they've found in those places.   And what do they convey? Basically, our modern analogue of "how beautiful the maidens were and how powerful and manly the knights were." It's odd Kesey would see this as such a useful exercise, considering its distance from any honest or serious examination of the  truth as one finds it . But it's fitting: the slice-of-life performance pieces turned out by Slate and other hip cultural outlets, despite their cynical postmodern caste, are essentially optimistic, ephemeral, blind to ugliness and material complexity.   Since you're last post, Amsden's written  urlLink another Slate article  detailing his (and supposedly pop culture's) long affair with dodge ball. Amsden has precisely nothing interesting to say on the subject (really, the piece is a performance which stars its own execution--isn't it cool I'm writing a whole article about dodge ball, which you thought was not a literary topic!). Here's the conclusion Amsden comes to after a long childhood memory that ends with Tim Woods "the ambassador of cool" in his grade-school, getting knocked out of dodgeball and joining dorky little David on the sidelines:  "We say hello, which I realize we've never done...As casualties, Tim and I become comrades, biking after school in the weeks to come, playing basketball ('Double Dribble' on Nintendo to be specific), debating the merits of cartoon characters. It was an evolution that slyly forced me to graze a deceptively simple epiphany, one that teases us all throughout life: that people are never quite what you think, which is just the sort of thing you can never really learn in a classroom."  I would echo your exclamation from the last point: this is a conclusion! That "people are never quite what you think." There's nothing "deceptive" about it, even for a ten year old. It's just (mind-numbingly) simple, (we won't even get into the sloppiness of language here, which begins with the question of how exaclty one "grazes" an epiphany).  Please please please  don't let this be a sign of the kind of performance writing Kesey thinks will supplant the novel. Here's a paragraph from near the end of a Rick Moody story I just finished, The Carnival Tradition, where the protagonist finds himself on the sidelines (ha ha, like Amsden) of a highschool party with a best friend he's realized that night he's going to have to ditch. You'll notice there's an actual attempt here to describe the emotional contours and conflicts of a moment-- fiction can do that :  "Some people had cruelties inflicted on them because cruelties had been inflicted on them in the past. These initial cruelties acted as magnets for further cruelties. You saw the wound, you saw the way the victim loved the wound. you saw the way he tended it, how lovingly, how pridefully, and you couldn't do anything but reopen his wound. In fact, it was almost  pleasurable  to be the source of renewed trauma for this unfortunate, because it was something the victim knew well. Therefore, you were reassuring him even while you were inflicting discomfort. That's how it was. Friendships turned on a dime. When Gerry ran off and left Julian on the golf tee, on the winter tee, when Gerry went to join the throng beside the creek, he knew he was doing something awful, but the worst part was that he had no remorse. There was a total absence of sympathy for Julian. He couldn't even imagine there was an inside to Julian Pelz; he couldn't imagine that Julian wasn't just some ugly kid with braces on his teeth who worked at the library and who was constantly hanging around. It was only later that Julian's face, receding in sheets of night, floated through the heavy conscience of Gerry Abramowitz."  Which depiction of an adolescent relationship between boys tells you more here? Which is actually tuned in to reality and makes some kind of stab at truth, and which glosses over rough points, reheating boyhood experience as a fairytale everyone knows it's not? It's pretty easy to see why fiction and books remain important to us--what's hard for me to understand is why good novelists like Kesey keep prediciting the irrelevance of their craft.

      As you know, I believe that I was supposed to have "been there" in the 60s.  Though I'm no flower child, I'm all too easily given to think this or that thing groovy, to feel that I'm riding the crest (there was apparently always a "crest" handy, waiting to be ridden in the 60s) towards a hopeful and illuminating future.    The corollary of reminiscing about having "been there" is, however, having also "done that."  There's something irretrievable (of course) about the 60s and I think one finds echoes of that lost legacy in journalism.   This week's double Fiction Issue of the New Yorker features an article by Robert Stone--"The Prince of Possibility: On the road with Ken Kesey."  (Sorry, no link available.  Buy it.)  [The Prince of Possibility is a terrible title; also, I think it's amusing that the New Yorker has finally turned to profiles of the dead, having catalogued the facial tics and social quirks of every living person who might excite their readers.]  I don't have the magazine with me, but the piece is characteristic of its brood--60s memories--in that Stone sounds consistently nostalgic.  The only place, it seems, similar to the 60s, was Eden.    The piece is also about the participatory journalism of the time.  Stone recollects how he was sent to Mexico to profile Kesey for Esquire, and how his article was eventually rejected because he "went native."  This is the age of Tom Wolfe and George Plimpton, of Hunter S. Thompson, and Gonzo Journalism.  The "merry pranksters" themselves acted as if they were journalists immersed in their own narrative: filming, recording, and photographing their progress towards the 1964 World's Fair.  Essentially they set out as amateur practitioners of the then-hot participatory journalism.     The Arts & Life section of Slate's online magazine is the modern inheritor of this sometimes great, journalistic notion.  There's even a section, if I remember correctly, in which a woman just  does something  for a week in response to reader suggestions.  (The one week I read it, she had decided to try not speaking.) But, most of these articles--and they are in no way specific to Slate--lack an animating principle.  They rarely teach you anything.  When there is analysis, it's hastily inserted between choice bits of dialogue and mildly amusing prose descriptions of whatever the main activity is supposed to be.    In this light, I wasn't as tickled as you and Josh were by  urlLink David Amsden's article on his high school reunion qua senior prom .  I didn't find it funny, but that's just because I have an unfortunately high threshold for written humor.  I also didn't think it was that good.  "Been there, done that, did it better," is how I imagined the amorphous body of 60s journalism commenting on his Prom Story.    Amsden too seems willing to acknowledge that something's missing.  The given raison d'etre for the piece admits as much, "I want to know how I, a grown man, will feel going out on a date with Sarah, an under-age girl. Resist your judgments, please. How can I not be curious?"    Shouldn't contemporary journalists be wary of continually satisfying their curiosity?  When will they ever be sated?  There's too much "curious journalism."   When Amsden does try to delve into analysis--it's always an abrupt, and artificial departure in these kind of articles--he finds himself not up to the task.  He doesn't have the right stuff:     This is the paradox, I think, that's largely responsible for why we as a culture are so prone to fetishize them. Because the sad fact is this: You get older, you grow jaded, and it becomes difficult to be genuinely shocked by something that doesn't involve, say, global strife on a mind-bogglingly massive scale. You start to crave a petty thrill. You miss it. And so you want to be able to cringe at the notion that kids are out there getting laid in parking lots, while continuing to demand details, because that way you can revel in your own manufactured shock while tricking yourself into believing you once lived in more innocent times. It's something to do. It's kind of silly. It's also, as Sarah would say, kind of gross.  Or something like that.  I don't have much time to process these thoughts--a moment later I'm clad in full sumo regalia, being knocked flat on my face, listening to a high-school principal yelling to anyone who is interested that I am down for the count.   That's the end of the article! That's how most of these pieces end: like an undergraduate (ahem) paper, turned in at the last minute, poorly thought out.    "I don't have much time to process these thoughts" is too often the mantra of today's experiential culture reporters. They try to insulate themselves from criticism by invoking their immersion in the scene--Amsden can't think about what this three-day article might mean to the reader because "I'm clad in full sumo regalia, being knocked flat on my face." Gosh, he's right there in the story! Dirty hands and all. What a journalist. What a mind.  Again, like everything from the 60s, this is just the hollow memory of something that can never be regained; it becomes in other words exactly what Amsden says it is: "a somewhat less innocent form of participatory journalism."

      We're a day late, but there's an illuminating  urlLink conversation being carried on   in honor of Bloomsday this week by novelist Jeffrey Eugenides and some hack named Jim Lewis about Joyce and contemporary fiction.  I'll discuss Eugenides, who is a lot smarter than Lewis and a little embarassed by the conversation, I think, after the conversation ends; here I'll stick to the narrow-minded but somewhat representative arguments of Lewis.  Lewis, in short, brags that he is "not much moved" by Joyce or Modernism. He confesses he admires Joyce's plainly written short story, The Dead, much more than Ulysses, and thinks Joyce need not have written anything else after he completed it. He then advances an embrassingly shallow theory about our society's transcendence of the need for an avant-garde in art which includes the (unbelievably embarassing, even if casually stated) comment: "Round about '77, something ended." Inevitably, Miller (whoever he is) sees fit to include his own cranky denunciation of all things influenced by the modernist experiment (i.e. Joyce):  "'Make it new,' Pound insisted. How much pale ink continues to be spilled in the service of that demand. I, for one, would like to see an unofficial ban on the following things: stories in which the author shows up as one of the characters, stories built around lists, or with the marginalia of writing moved to the center (dedications, errata, footnotes, etc.). I would like to see mere cleverness and innovation removed from the practice, along with all cheap ironies, second-guessing, meretricious tricks with time (stories written in the present tense, narrative running backwards, games with simultaneity, and so on), the substitution of swaths of facts and factoids for inspiration and invention … and so on...Above all, I would insist that novelists who think they're smarter than their characters, and more sophisticated than the idea of the novel itself, and who cannot resist the temptation to demonstrate as much, ought instead to find deeper characters and better stories to write. I want a book to break my heart; everything else is television."   Let me make a quick statement of rubuttal : I, for one, whould like to see an unofficial ban on critics and writers of middling talent who think they're smarter than the novelists they critique and like to show it by demonstrating to their readers how totally exhausted and "spent" they are by literary experimentation, tricks, irony, narrative confusion, language tricks, footnotes, marginalia, etc. Hereby, I especially would like to see such critics keep their grubby pens away from James Joyce and other geniuses who comprise the most important cultural contribution the west has made since Shakespeare. If a few young Joyce or Pynchon followers go over the top in their attempt to follow said authors, this does not represent a threat to literature as said critics think they know it, nor is it any more contemptible than renouncing literary expermimentation of all kinds just because some people don't do it well. In fact, contrary to the dominant belief among said critics, the trend in contemporary fiction is toward cautious naturalism (see New Yorker Summer Fiction Issue, Alice Munro) not formal invention (see  urlLink cool reception for Wallace's Oblivion ).  It's interesting Lewis names Hawkes and Coover and Barth and Gaddis and Gass as some of the authors who betrayed him in his youth because of their obsession with formal invention--I get the feeling they betrayed a lot of people who grew up in the 70s and 80s, and turned them against narrative "tricks" for all time. But that makes sense: besides Gaddis, those were not the best writers of their era, just the most trendy in the academy and probably with young people (maybe like many multicultural writers today, of whom people growing up now will tire shortly). And many of them  were  overly obsessed with formal inventions--which is not the same as experimentalism; I think Barth is the most didactic author I've ever read. The best writers of that period were Roth, Brodkey, DeLillo, Nabokov, Pynchon and (maybe) Updike--they were all experimental in their own ways (every great writer is), but more importantly they were all great thinkers and great writers, which is always the only real important ingredient for...well, great writing.   It's obviously as dumb to be against experimental writing as it is to be for it, in all cases. Unfortunately, those that take Lewis's line (and there are a lot of them, judging from  urlLink responses to Bloomsday , as well as the lack of response to  urlLink Wallace's new book ), first of all excuse themselves from having to take seriously authors they consider experimental (Wallace, Moody, Saunders, etc), some of whom are among the best people writing today. Secondly, their stance discourages new writers from trying new things, which I think is a shame.  Did you see the conversation Adam? What did you think? And also, remember what a nerd William Gass was and how we had to leave the room because we were laughing so hard at him when he spoke at Brown? That was funny.

      The hammer has clearly come  urlLink down on David Brooks  from just about every angle the last few days, with the release of his new book,   urlLink On Paradise Drive  . In the  urlLink New York Times ,  urlLink Slate  and  urlLink The Washington Monthly  , Brooks and his new book have been slammed recently. The dominant line is that Brooks uses too many abstractions, and often fudges the truth to make general points. This is certainly true, but constitutes an essentially journalistic concern, put forth by journalists who I think always tend to be suspicious (and probably rightly so) of colleagues who use lists of semi-facts to make abstract points (See Confessore's distinction between Brooks the journalist and Brooks the hack). I think it may miss a more interesting point about Brooks's intentions and what he has chosen to show a preference for and what he keeps coming out against. That is, no one mentions  why  Brooks fudges the truth or what end his factual distortions serve. I think the salient issue is why he's gotten away with it for this long--that is, the susceptibility and tolerance we have even in blue liberal culture for the  kind of  streotypes Brooks trades in. Imagine the outrage you'd see if the below characature was directed at a black single mother rather than the suburban wife of a professor:  "The assistant anthropology professor can stride through life knowing she was unanimously elected chairwoman of her crunchy suburb's sustainable-growth seminar. She wears the locally approved status symbols: the Tibet-motif dangly earrings, the Andrea Dworkin-inspired hairstyle, the peasant blouse, and the public-broadcasting tote bag … No wonder she feels so righteous in her beliefs."  Now here's the opening to Brooks's 2002 Atlantic Monthly article on the red blue divide--again, were this paragraph reversed in it's inference we wouldn't stand for it:  "Sixty-five miles from where I am writing this sentence is a place with no Starbucks, no Pottery Barn, no Borders or Barnes & Noble. No blue New York Times delivery bags dot the driveways on Sunday mornings. In this place people don't complain that Woody Allen isn't as funny as he used to be, because they never thought he was funny. In this place you can go to a year's worth of dinner parties without hearing anyone quote an aperçu he first heard on Charlie Rose. The people here don't buy those little rear-window stickers when they go to a summer-vacation spot so that they can drive around with 'MV' decals the rest of the year; for the most part they don't even go to Martha's Vineyard."  These are kind of funny and (we think for a moment) perceptive sketches of culture and character, but I think there's a viciousness couched in them which we accept because we think it's directed at a kind of person we can all agree is despicable. But frankly the viciousness is not acceptable--neither is it true or informative. The sensibility displayed in passages like these--and Brooks's work is replete with them--melds good old fashioned anti-intellectualism with a casually biting form of xenophobia directed at the foreigners in our midst—that is, those whose values conflict with real American values, and who thus take refuge in hypocrisy and quirky self-inflation. As we all know, these aren't real people--they're cultural touchstones constructed by the right wing to make a mockery of liberal values. This kind of bullying chauvinism might be old hat on cultural outlets such as the O'Reilly Factor or in one of Ann Coulter's books--Brooks's significance is that he has carried such a point of view into supposedly liberal flagships like the Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times.   In his article about Brooks,  urlLink Nick Confessore  says "people enjoy reading Brooks the Journalist precisely because he is one of the few right-leaning pundits who doesn't seem to believe that liberals are evil." The truth is Brooks doesn't  say  liberals are evil--not outright anyway--but passages like the two above suggest an insidious, pseudo-subtle (which means, it looks subtle but really isn't subtle at all) hatred of the accoutrements and habits of a kind of person everybody knows is basically uber-liberal. That Brooks couches his bias as cultural anthropology just makes it more effective and more dangerous.  Brooks's diagrams of society have achieved wide currency in mainstream culture. One could see Brooks's influence, for instance, in the Washington Post's dissection of the  urlLink red and blue political split  in April. That series of articles portrayed liberalism as basically an emotional contortion, a flailing, illogical or  urlLink simplistic response to life’s bad events , punctuated by hypocrisy and an inability to make meaningful distinctions.   I think Brooks is a good writer, but I'm glad there's a backlash against his work lately. I think he deserves it, and we should stop giving him credit for being too smart to really mean the things he writes or infers. We should also (and by we, I mean blue culture) start defending ourselves against the attacks he levels on what always seems like a stereotype of a person we hate, but when you get right down to it he's attacking...well, us and the things that are important to us. Brooks reminds me of those people in life I have to keep reminding myself are not nearly as thoughtful or smart as they are good at looking thoughtful and smart.

      "If you are brown and decide to date a British man, sooner or later he will present you with a Paul Gauguin...It will always be a painting from Gauguin's Tahitian period, 1891-1903. Chances are nudity will be involved, and also some spherical fruit."  -  urlLink Zadie Smith, p.150    Why It's Annoying:  One reads this and wonders: in what sense is it true? One concludes it is neither personally nor universally true, and on the level it tries to be true--culturally--it is probably not true either. Where it is maybe contingently almost true is in New Yorker world--the cultural and semi-pseudo-literary world of New Yorker writers and readers, where perhaps people know not only a few things about Gauguin but also about his "Tahitian period" and can appreciate the toothless in-joke that lurks somewhere in the line about "spherical fruit" and "nudity." This is not enough to legitimize it as the opening line of published work by an author that takes herself seriously and is thought of seriously as a good contemporary artist. It is typical, however, of annoying New Yorker fiction or pseudo-fiction which does not bother with real truth but is very excited by cultural "truths," no matter how (actually) untrue (and if true, irrelevant) they might be.   What's More Annoying:  That in the "summer fiction issue" there were only four pieces of fiction, and three were by Alice Munro. (If you want proof Munro is a totally inconsequential and awkward writer, read " urlLink Chance ," the only of the three stories I could even finish). The above Smith blurb is from her nonfiction story about a trip she once took, as part of the summer fiction issue's "travel" section. Of course, all the fiction pieces also deal with travel, tourism, or take readers to  urlLink exotic locations . There could be an interesting study done, I think, on the confluence of "travel" with "fiction" in the New Yorker. Fiction often becomes just a vehicle for exploring semi-exotic places. For those of us who prefer fiction to travel, this is a shame. Unfortunately, I think we are in the minority.

      Hey Adam, what do you think about Oprah's book club? Obviously, as a snob, I have a knee-jerk reaction of condescension towards the club, and kind of sneer whenever I see people reading a book with that big colorful sticker on it (which led to problems of my own when I tried to read The Corrections), but an argument could be made she's the best thing to happen to serious literature in the history of the modern world. Her  urlLink newest choice  is Anna Karenina, by Tolstoy. The fact is, it doesn't do any harm, and it probably does a lot of good to have a bunch of people who don't read reading, and not only reading but reading Tolstoy--that is, if you believe that reading great literature is an important part of life and maybe the  most  important part of life, and helps educate deep parts of ourselves to be more humane and thoughtful, as I do (as most of the people who probably sneer at Oprah do).   So why does it bother me? The book club doesn't hurt anyone and shouldn't ruin anything for those of us who choose not to participate. And the ovewhelming majority of Winfrey's  urlLink selections  have been good books, and many of them have been great books. As is well-documented, she's been basically a life raft for the United States publishing industry, and helped the careers of a lot of deserving authors--and now a couple translators, as  urlLink this NYT story documents --but if we believe in reading and in reading good literature then we have to believe that she's made a lot of people a little better (as people), which is maybe or  maybe not  even more important than saving the publishing industry.  The "maybe not" part is where I suspect we who find ourselves annoyed by Oprah's book club actually have to look for why we're annoyed. I think deep down we assume you can't "lead" people to great books, and that part of the experience of reading a great book is choosing to read it--and it's not a group activity but a solitary one, and it's not fun and shouldn't be fun. But then beneath that is also the belief I think a lot of us have that it doesn't really matter if a lot of people are a little better off for having read Anna Karenina. I think we (what I really mean is "I") actually don't want everyone thinking they can read such books and we feel it somehow demeans  the book  they're all reading (Some authors feel this way too: see  urlLink Jonathan Franzen, The Corrections. )  What it comes down to, I think, is a basic modern conceit we all know is fundamentally wrongheaded but believe anyway--that is, that something has to be difficult and in some way inaccessible and in some way completely over the heads of the average book buyer to be really truly worthy of high-culture status and an intellectually serious response. This is obviously snobbish and narrow-minded.  The thing is, I really do believe it, and I can't stand Oprah's book club. I wish they'd keep they're grubby hands off the classics.

      We had a little scare here in D.C. today. As Ronald Reagan's flag-draped body was transported across the district, the Capitol Building and Supreme Court were  urlLink briefly evacuated  when a plane heading towards Reagan Airport veered into security alarmed fly space. Wolf Blitzer looked very concerned on CNN, stating that "after 9/11 a false alarm is no longer just a false alarm." In fact, however, it turns out a false alarm is what it always was--an alarm that is false; and everybody's okay.  I don't know though--Adam, were you scared? I was pretty scared.

      Does anyone else think there's always something a little creepy about the articles the NY Times does about sex? Especially  kids  and sex. I'm thinking first off of the one about New York City guys taking Viagara before going out at night from last fall, and now we have this week's  urlLink magazine cover story :  Friends, Friends With Benefits and the Benefits of the Local Mall . The article is actually pretty good, especially after you get past the first couple pages, but nevertheless big chunks of it come off as thinly veiled child porn. For those of us who attended highschool recently, not a whole lot in the article is surprising--although I will say it appears to be a whole different world out there in the suburbs, and meeting people on the Internet appears to be a lot more accepted and cool than I'd thought it was--but the piece is truly written for those who haven't attended highschool recently, our parents and their generational allies. Here's a little excerpt, about Emcho, clearly the kind of preternaturally good looking, healthy, socially casual guy that made everyone else in highschool virtually swoon with envy and self-hatred:  "Tall and lanky, with brown hair and a crush-inducing smile, Emcho said there are benefits to being highly rated on a site like facethejury. There was the college girl online who invited Emcho and a friend over to a party at her apartment. ''I was online writing my senior paper,'' Emcho said, ''and this girl instant-messages me and says, 'Hey, I saw your picture on facethejury.''' She invited Emcho over that night. They had sex in her bathroom, Emcho told me, and met up a few more times, but he says he cut it off when she started talking about wanting to date him.   Emcho and Haris said they're both partial to ''preppy suburban girls.'' As Haris put it, ''City girls are cool, but suburban girls are crazy cool!'' (Meaning, Haris explains, that suburban girls are ''easier.'') Recently, he and Emcho met up with two high-school girls. One girl offered to sneak them all into her house, where she and Emcho hooked up on the floor, while Haris and her friend used the closet."  I'm just not sure this belongs in The New York Times. Here's one other excerpt, from an e-mail conversation a highschool girl forwarded the author:   Boy : I wish you lived like next door. . . . It would be so much easier. . . . Like I don't know about you, but I wanna [expletive].    Melissa : U always wanna [expletive].    Boy : True.    Melissa : Haha.    Boy : But that's cuz we've been talking about it and haven't done it. It's built up.    Melissa : That's bc u haven't picked me up yet silly. . . . Well I'm gonna go lay down. U know my number and where I live if things work out soon.    Boy : Hey wait. If I can do you wanna come over?    Melissa : Sure. So just call me.    Boy : Do you have condoms?    Melissa : Yes dear.     Boy : I can come get you right now if you want.    Melissa : Um gimme a sec. . . .    Boy : O.K.?? I'll come get you now if you're ready. . . .    Melissa : But I'm gonna be boring tonite . . . and I'm just telling u I'm not in the mood for nething but str8-up sex.  Okay, okay, maybe it's really  me  that's made uncomfortable and sort of envious by this stuff. This kind of life does sound like a lot of fun, after all. But still, I don't know, we've got a lot of outlets for this kind of journalism in our society--do we really need the crotchety New York Times with its crotchety audience doing articles like this? In any event, the article is worth reading, mainly for its exploration of whether teenagers actually  enjoy  any of this hooking up stuff. Having missed out on virtually everything during high school, I like to hear that all the things I missed out on just made people depressed and volatile. Now, if only I could believe it were true.

      I never liked Dave Eggers  that  much as a writer, but I used to think he was, at the very least, really cool, and at most, an important motivating force behind a lot of good contemporary fiction. But then he started the  urlLink tutorial program  for poor kids who don't get writing instruction in San Franscisco, published an  urlLink editorial in the NY Times  on how great Teach-for-America was, and now I think his hip-but-caring social action side has just gone totally over the edge. Case in point: This  urlLink schlocky, sanctimonious, boringly written, pseudo-political article for Mother Jones . Eggers is rapidly becoming the Bono of postmodern literature. It's not that I disagree with anything he writes...it's just he's gotten so  annoying ...

      NYT Michiko Kakutani's  urlLink review of Wallace's new collection of short stories "Oblivion,"  can be read here. Kakutani has been famously confused by Wallace in the past--I don't think she's ever understood much about him. Still, she's mostly right in this review--Oblivion tends to be Wallace at his worst. But Kakutani also blasts Brief Interviews, which is like the best book of short stories released in the last decade--when you think about it, Kakutani is really nothing special (as a reviewer). Wait 'till I publish my review of Oblivion in a few days, it's going to be unebelievably better than Kakutani's...

      Princeton professor and oldschool feminist Christine Stansell puts forth a confusing argument in her  urlLink Slate book review  today about why young women often stop working:  "Routinely, they (ambitious young women) head off from graduate and professional schools to demanding positions in business, philanthropy, medicine, the law. They do everything asked of them and more, but unaccountably, as they draw closer to the vocations for which they've long been preparing, a cloud gathers over them. By turns hectoring and anxious, a gloomy chorus announces that success will deplete their romantic prospects and cheat them out of the families they want to have. It seems that Virginia Woolf's imagined adversary, the Victorian Angel in the House—she who always put her own needs second—rises to flap triumphantly over the times, despite Woolf's hope that modern women would kill her."  Isn't this kind of a silly or dated and possibly irresponsible argument? Even within the above paragraph there are contradictions--is it "romantic prospects" that make women stop working or is it that girls always "put [their] own needs second?" The two would seem to point in opposite directions. Later, Stansell suggests it's the "glass ceiling" that makes women stop working, since at a certain point they stop getting positive rewards for their performance. I don't know, the ambitious girls I know that have stopped working in their late 20s, early 30s have done so because they find, after all their preparations, that they  don't like work . It's not that they "put their needs second," it's that their needs turn out  not  to include the need to work a nine-to-five job. I think Stansell's argument is out-of-date, maybe true of Virginia Woolf's generation but not of this one. Personally, the argument offends me a little because well-educated women that stop working when they're 28, whether to spend more time with their families or not, shouldn't get to think of themselves as martyrs. It's not a "gloomy chorus" that tells women to stop working, it's the chorus inside their head. It says: "work sucks--why would I want to put myself through this if I don't have to?" The women I know that like work tend to keep working.     See Caitlin Flanagan for more on how middle-class women make excuses for their own decisions to  urlLink stop working, or keep working ...  (Adam, is this a stupid post? Does anyone else care about this? Maybe this is kind of self-indulgent, I don't know. Will you please write something so I don't feel so alone on this page.)

       Category: Politics   Drudge today reports the video introducing John Kerry at the convention on Thursday is going to include grainy footage shot mostly with Kerry's own camera of  urlLink himself as a war hero in Vietnam . I've been impressed so far by the quality of the DNC videos, almost all of which move me to tears at some point (shows you how much  tears  are worth), so it's little surprise Kerry's video will be shot by Steven Spielberg protégé James Moll (hopefully he'll resist any Saving Private Ryan moments).  I hadn't heard any of this stuff before but Drudge digs up a lot of old stuff about Kerry and his camera in Vietnam. A naval officer says this:  "Kerry would revisit ambush locations for reenacting combat scenes where he would portray the hero, catching it all on film.  Kerry would take movies of himself walking around in combat gear, sometimes dressed as an infantryman walking resolutely through the terrain.  He even filmed mock interviews of himself narrating his exploits.  A joke circulated among Swiftees was that Kerry left Vietnam early not because he received three Purple Hearts, but because he had recorded enough film of himself to take home for his planned political campaigns."  A 1996 article in the Boston Globe fleshes out the picture more:   "[The Kerry home movies] reveal something indelible about the man who shot them - the tall, thin, handsome Naval officer seen striding through the reeds in flak jacket and helmet, holding aloft the captured B-40 rocket. The young man so unconscious of risk in the heat of battle, yet so focused on his future ambitions that he would reenact the moment for film.  It is as if he had cast himself in the sequel to the experience of his hero, John F. Kennedy, on the PT-109 ."  I read this wrong the first time, and thought it said he had cast himself in the sequel to  his own  experience, which I wrongly interpreted as a  brilliant  insight by the Boston Globe reporter. Drudge obviously thinks all of this reflects terribly on Kerry, but I'm more interested in the information as a code for what politicians do and how they have to live their lives to be successful. Was it arrogance or grotesque ambition or foresight that made Kerry tape himself in Vietnam?  In any event, it's clear the Vietnam experience simultaneously confirms the most noble and the most petty or bothersome elements of Kerry's character. He actually  did  risk his life, as we've been reminded by at least a dozen speakers at the convention this week, but he was also burdensomely cognizant of his action in the war as an episode in a narrative that had something to do with the life he hoped to lead, the future he'd have and a lot of his fellow soldiers wouldn't.  But, then again, isn't this how politicians have to live if they want to be successful? This anecdote about Kerry made me think that maybe politicians, a lot like artists, are doomed or blessed, depending on how much you value real intimate contact with life, to live at a remove from their own experiences. Each thing they do, no matter how traumatic or heartfelt, registers at least partly as a chapter in the "life story" they're crafting as they go, for use in, say, their convention speech when they get nominated for president or the video that precedes it. I get the sense John Kerry has always been starring in the sequel to his own life.   The picture of him re-enacting combat scenes in Vietnam jungles is certainly a little pathetic, but I bet the video will play well at the convention tonight. Was it worth it? I don't know - the artist who takes notes in the middle of a conversation always seems absurd until he writes the Great American Novel. It's not entirely fair, but to a certain extent we judge people who commodify their lives by the quality of the product they end up with. If Kerry becomes president, in other words, we'll be glad he brought his camera to Vietnam.   Note to Adam:  Everyone but you seems to be blogging from the Convention. Give us something. Please.

       Category: Culture     &nbsp;  Who says&nbsp;we're not making progress in Iraq? Christian Science Monitor reports  urlLink Reality TV has come to Baghdad :    The scene: a humble clay house on one of Baghdad's meanest streets. A knock at the door. When the man of the house answers, he is astonished:    "We have presents for you!" warbles Shaima Emad Zubair, a young siren with tangerine lipstick. Batting her blue-mascaraed eyes, she pokes her microphone his way. Behind her, several boys unload a washing machine, refrigerator, TV, sofa set, and more from the back of a truck as a camera crew films.   "This is a big surprise," says Ahmed Hassan Kadhim, standing in the doorway with a gap-toothed grin. "What can I say?"   Indeed&nbsp;"Labor and Materials," Iraq's answer to "Extreme Home&nbsp;Makeover" is&nbsp;taking&nbsp;Iraqi homes destroyed by American bombing and rebuilding them with new&nbsp;furniture and appliances.&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point, just like in American TV shows, isn't the task (of rebuilding the house) itself,&nbsp;"but to show the change in the psychology of the family during the rebuilding," says Ali Hanoon, the show's director. "The rebuilding has a psychological effect on the families - their memories, their lives, are in these walls."   Of course, there are still hiccups:&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two months ago, Mahdi Army militants pistol-whipped a Sharqiya cameraman, thinking he was a Western journalist, and stole his equipment. They gave it back when they realized he was from an Iraqi station."   But that's to be expected. Iraq is, after all, um, a war zone.   Still, the show is immensely popular. The families selected become instant national celebrities, just like the subjects of reality shows here. More to the point, it rebuilds lives:&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the crew leaves, the family spills out on to the street for a joyous sendoff. Beside their door is a plaque: 'On May 4, 2004, AL SHARQIYA TV rebuilt this house, which was destroyed by war,' it reads, the station's name in large green letters. "   It's only appropriate, of course. I can remember when 50 million Americans tuned in to watch the finale of&nbsp;Joe Millionaire a few days after&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;attacked Baghdad. Weren't we really&nbsp;fighting&nbsp;for the Iraqis' right&nbsp;to one day&nbsp;have the same&nbsp;wealth of entertainment distractions?   You know, it always seems to work this way, we bomb people's houses, screw up politically, then leave it to pop culture to bail us out. It's the only tool we have capable of  rebuilding  anything (like, for instance, our international reputation).&nbsp;Anyway, I'm sure Murdoch will buy the show shortly. It just seems too good for Fox News to pass up.

       Category: Politics    The oddest thing I've come across in the 9/11 Commission Report so far is this item on page 3:   "The Hazmi brothers (two of the hijackers, checking in at Dulles), were also selected for extra scrutiny by the airline's customer service representative at the check-in counter. He did so because one of the brothers did not have a photo identification nor could he understand english, and because the agent found both of the passengers to be suspicious. The only consequence of their selection was that their checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that they had boarded the aircraft."   The report, which just sort of&nbsp;moves on from here, doesn't seem to find this as odd as I do. I mean, even before 9/11 you  had to have ID  to get on a plane, didn't you? One of the funny and surprising&nbsp;things about the report's account of the hijackings is how&nbsp;sloppily it&nbsp;seems to have been&nbsp;planned. Seriously,&nbsp;what kind of self-respecting terrorist shows up at the airport without an ID or basic English skills? Later on, these same brothers set off the metal detectors at Dulles... twice . Some of the terrorists at other airports were frisked also and appeared uncomfortable,&nbsp;sort of as if&nbsp;they'd never been to airports before. Papers everywhere have headlined Thomas Kean's statement that the attacks were not stopped because of a " urlLink failure of imagination " by government officials, but the failure of imagination mainly occurred at lower levels - for instance the customer service rep. at Dulles must just not have  imagined  that even a suspicious looking Arab who&nbsp;had no&nbsp;ID was going to hijack an airplane.   Government officials, on the other hand, had imagined everything that happened. In fact, this is one of the watershed findings of the Commission (that Richard Clarke, Sandy Berger and others had imagined almost  exactly what&nbsp;occurred  years ago), which is what makes Kean's statement&nbsp;kind of puzzling.  urlLink Fred&nbsp;Kaplan puts it best :   "The failure was not one of imagination but rather of incentives. It turns out that many individuals, panels, and agencies had predicted an attack uncannily similar to what happened on Sept. 11, 2001. The problem was that nobody in a position of power felt compelled to do anything about it."

      As you know, Brian recently chided me when I remarked that the new BP stations were meant to “look like the future.”  I believed the gas stations has been intentionally designed to communicate this message, that the BP corporation embraces and evinces a "futuristic" quality.  Now that I have a blog and Brian doesn’t, I’m prepared to issue my comebacks.   Brian’s point was that I was overthinking everything; he believes that BP did not have an advertising message in mind when it designed the gas station, that the stations were constructed to be functional only.  Where I saw white, weightless pods (like a docking station out of  2001 ), he saw cheap, lightweight building materials bolted together according to the soundest, simplest engineering principles.    The irony in this is that Brian is more likely than any person on earth (the French excepted) to inform you that your seemingly quotidian life is actually an enmeshed cultural production of an incomprehensibly sophisticated and idiosyncratically-termed theoretical système.  His every thought borders on critical sublimity.  He has no doubt thought of himself as a “subject position.”  To have him then denounce my BP-station=advertising theory was liking hearing McLuhan decide that, on second thought, this 'medium is the message' business is a trite too theoretical after all.   In fact--contre Monsieur Nagendra--every edifice of the modern city, like every pixel and inkdot of modern media, is hawking something.  It was perhaps excusable several decades ago to distinguish between things that are sold and things that are not, but no such polarity exists anymore.  It was likewise perhaps once possible to isolate and identify discrete advertising mediums, but, again, such boundaries have flooded their banks in the wake of the modern advertising deluge.    Even if architecture has not always been about selling product, it has inherently always been about sending messages.  Gothic spires point to heaven, Greek columns and cornices promote Reason, and the Pompidou warns of the implosion of consumption.  From such givens it is easy to construct a proof for the theorem that a McDonald’s store (even one whose iconic golden arches, let us imagine, have been taken down overnight) advertises the entire McDonald’s brand.     To treat traditional media as still somehow special, as solely taking on the task of communicating for the company, is to identify with a world existing some time in the beginning of the 20th century.  The advertising message is now communicated as effectively (in certain cases, more so) by the physical structure of the corporate head office and the local franchise as in print, TV, and radio. The entire corporation implodes into advertising medium.  BP, in fact, is an example of a company whose entire "presence" in the mind of the consumer results from his perception of the corporate architecture.   The station metonymically supplants the product.   We only see the actual gasoline in the rarest, and usually most unfortunate, circumstances: if you have to lug it back to your broken-down car, or if it spills while refueling.  It is flammable, dangerous, toxic, and corrosive.  If we do not associate these qualities with the company, or the gasoline itself, it is in part because of the messages communicated by the station.  Welcome to BP, proclaim the backlit halogen panels and atomic neon logo, welcome to your efficient, scientific and superior future.    [I think there's room for a counter-post on the anonymity of huge corporate offices (interior and exterior), but if no one wants to take that  up, I'll probably do so myself.]

       Category: Culture    This week's  urlLink Newsweek  offers an intriguing (and by intriguing I mean  depressing )&nbsp;perspective on the way youth culture sees and defines itself these days. If you read the  urlLink cover story , "iPod Therefore i Am," alongside the  urlLink winning GENEXT essay , you get a case study in the way young people buy the marketing campaigns designed to shape their personality (but, ingeniously, always designed&nbsp;to seem like they're  appealing  to that personality), and then re-present that material in a manner they think makes them an individual but actually marks them as an ironclad member of a pre-defined group.   Accordingly the iPod&nbsp;cover story&nbsp;is not so much about the iPod as a musical innovation as it is about its status as a kind of personality accessory. A girl&nbsp;tells how she&nbsp;gave a name to her iPod, because&nbsp;"I wanted to keep it close to my heart and give it a name." A professor says having an iPod helps him "bond" with his students. An ancecdote recounts how the young writer of&nbsp;Fox's "The O.C." balked at being told&nbsp;they couldn't use the iPod on the show anymore :&nbsp;"It's what our audience uses and what our characters would use," he says. (a  urlLink separate article  has the author telling his iPod why he's breaking up with it).&nbsp;All of these things are essentially demonstrative of a marketing campaign so effective its made itself invisible. These people talk as if their iPods, a kind of McLuhan-esque outgrowth of their&nbsp;personal selves,&nbsp;allow them to express (or help others intuit) their unique, quirky&nbsp;personlities, when in fact it's&nbsp;the marketing behind the iPod (and Apple and youth products in general)&nbsp; which makes kids think it's important to have such personalities in the first place, replete with quirks satisfied readily by evolving commerical products.   The story&nbsp;is a&nbsp;virtual paean to Mac culture - that is, cool, free, "dialed in,"&nbsp;individualistic within an&nbsp;accepted framework, technology savvy but not obsessed with technology, devoted to personal choice&nbsp;etc. Of course, Apple is a  urlLink corporation  like any other, and&nbsp;its image has been engineered carefully by Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who&nbsp;says (I think without irony) that his product "is as Apple as anything Apple has ever done." iPOd&nbsp;ought to be Jobs's dream product. Even as metaphor it is the perfect youth model. By owning it, kids announce themselves as part of a certain community (those that own iPods), but they can use their playlists to simultaneously delimit their "individuality" within that community. Moreover, the media is music, which has long been the most personality-connected artform. There are very few people who don't see the songs they like and the way they listen to music as an integral outgrowth of the kind of person they are or would like to be.   Not to be alarmist (I'm actually noncommital on whether&nbsp;I even think this is a big deal), but&nbsp;it seems to me iPod culture is entirely consistent with the shallow, blathering essay which won the youth essay contest sponsored by Newsweek and MTV&nbsp;and printed in this week's issue. The author,  urlLink seen here  sitting on her college green with her iMac, can't be bothered with the bigger political issues like poverty and war; she really wants politics to be more like direct marketing, catered to her concerns:   "I am not disengaged, I'm worn out. Sometimes I feel that no matter how I vote, there will still be war, crime and poverty. And I have other things on my mind. I am worried about skin cancer, drunken drivers, eating disorders, what I'm going to be when I grow up, how I'm going to get there and what I'm going to do Friday night."   Funny - I don't think she  sounds  disengaged or worn out, I think she sounds dumb (although if I had to pick one, I'd say she definitely sounds  more  disengaged than worn out). Then again, maybe I just don't appreciate all the things a politician could do to help&nbsp;Traci figure out her Friday night plans. What's really remarkable is that Traci states her shallow, self-involved concerns - eating disorders, skin care, what  she's  going to be, how  she'll  spend her weekend - as if they're something to be proud of. And what do I know - maybe they are. After all, she  won  the contest.&nbsp;I suspect she won because her specific complaints fit perfectly into the square box Newsweek and MTV have decided means "youth," just like individual songs fit into the  urlLink iPod interface .&nbsp; Traci concludes with this Whitmanesque bit of poetry:   "I am active on campuses across the country, but this part of me is recognized only as a minority—a few bright stars in an otherwise dark night. I am not a dark knight. I will not ride in on my horse come November and steal the election for one candidate or another. I don't know if I will even really vote at all. But I do know that I am 48 million strong. And if someone would just reach out to me—not just during election years, but every day—I would show them overwhelming support at the polls."   If someone would just "reach out" to poor uncared for Traci..." not just&nbsp;during election years, but every day. "&nbsp;Hmmmm....is it too late for&nbsp;iPod to run this year?

       Category: Culture   &nbsp;  Try to figure out what David Brooks is trying to say with this  urlLink shockingly incoherent column  in today's New York Times. Seriously, try. I dare you (start with the simple question of&nbsp;what&nbsp;Brooks means by "practical knowldedge," [it's not what the rest of us mean, I can assure you that]&nbsp;and&nbsp;what its relation is to "squirrel-like specialization"). Then, if you have time, and actually want to be guided on some kind of serious exploration of the issues Brooks is raising here, which have something to do (I think) with the role of the university professor&nbsp;in&nbsp;contemporary society, then you might want to check out  urlLink Gideon Lewis-Kraus's long essay  about his journey to this year's MLA Convention in San Diego.  &nbsp;  Kraus's essay, you'll see, actually uses an anecdotal narrative to reflect on a complicated issue (and&nbsp;one important thing here is that Kraus  realizes  it's complicated), which is: what is the role of an English professor in today's world? Does s/he have a responsibility to reach outside his/her own hermetic intellectual community? If so, why? If not, why not? In the context of Kraus's experience, these questions arise naturally and are considered in an impressively open-minded manner. I learned a lot from Kraus's column, and often re-thought (several times) some of my own ideas about university life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Brooks, first of all, is not open-minded and doesn't even pretend to be. He arranges anecdotes into prearranged slots designed to bolster his theories about the world.  &nbsp;  Maybe more disturbingly, in terms of trying to follow his arguments as a reader, Brooks has not yet figured out how to make anecdotes work for him in the space of his column. His latest is just another example of his penchant for placing a story side-by-side with an idea, and not really developing either.&nbsp;The silly tale he tells about how a student he used to know has written a manuscript he likes about a&nbsp;Yale professor&nbsp;a lot of other students used to revere (supposedly because he had succeeded outside the Academy, although no&nbsp;proof for this is given),&nbsp;has basically nothing to do with his conclusion: that students "are drawn to a teacher who is not a lifelong academic, but who was active in the real world" and thus universities should be less&nbsp;hermetic.&nbsp;Does he really think his preceding story has proved this?  &nbsp;  All it proves is that&nbsp;some students he knew were drawn to one professor who had not spent his life in the Academy. I, for one, know some Yale students who were deeply inspired by classes they took with Harold Bloom, who has spent&nbsp;virtually every&nbsp;minute of his life in an&nbsp;Academy. I might find the testimony of these friends or aquaintances of mine interesting, and might even bring it up in conversation to demonstrate some point or other - what I certainly wouldn't&nbsp;do is use&nbsp;it as&nbsp;the basis for an opinion piece in the New York Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Category: Personal   &nbsp;  I didn't do much this weekend, but my almost two year old nephew had a signature moment. Here it is,&nbsp;retold dramatically&nbsp;by his mother:    "Just wanted to let you all know that yesterday Gabriel peed in the potty. I mean a real full fledged bladder emptying experience occurred. B/f he went to take a nap he said, "Pee.Pee." We took off the diaper. He sat down. He peed and the pee stayed in the potty which is key. He stood up and, of course, we all looked in the potty and there it all was. The PEE! Gabriel smiled and clapped his hands. We haven't been able to get him to do it again, but that's okay. It was still a big day here"

       Category: Culture   &nbsp;  In what appears to be Britain's answer to the rash of left-wing political documentaries that has broken out here in America, the  urlLink LA Times reports  on "a powerful trend in Britain — today's news and political debates being taken directly to the stage." The newest offering is " urlLink Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom ," a London play whose dialogue is drawn directly from interviews, speeches and letters of family members of detainees, freed prisoners, government officials and others.&nbsp;The play, as you might expect, is garnering rave reviews:  urlLink The Independent  calls it "an eloquent indictment of the suspect political practices and mentality that have led to the creation what Lord Justice Steyn (whose Mann Lecture opens the proceedings) has called 'the legal black hole.'"  &nbsp;  I hate this kind of stuff. It bothers me that it's even made and it bothers me even more that people flock to it and&nbsp;tell each other&nbsp;they're&nbsp;witnessing art. The Independent review mentions the play is cobbled together from spoken testimonies, which means, really, that none of it is written. None of it is created. It's basically just a montage of political statements put on stage to give it the illusion of theater. But that's not right either because plays like this want it both ways--they claim the illusion of&nbsp;theater to be considered art, but claim they're&nbsp;not theater (as&nbsp;in, based on real spoken testimony)&nbsp;to be considered politically serious.  &nbsp;  I can tell, just from  urlLink this (exceedingly boring) exerpt,  that&nbsp;I would hate this play even though I also hate&nbsp;what's happening at Guantanamo and probably agree with the play's political point of view. The fact is America-bashing&nbsp;for the sake of America-bashing is no&nbsp;less annoying&nbsp;when the criticism is warranted than when it's not.&nbsp; The fact is, despite popular charicatures to the contrary, the rash of liberal documentaries which have hit theatres recently are really made by people who like America and understand what's good about it and think it's worth rescuing.&nbsp;When you start with the premise (as the British do) that America was basically a bad idea to begin with, and is peopled with primitives and yahoos, the critique becomes more of a harangue. And elements of imperial condescension kind of pervade the whole thing. &nbsp; In addition, the easiness with which America-bashing "art" gains not only acceptance but rave reviews from the British press (Did anyone see that musical, "The Madness of King George," which somehow was perceived as funny by British people?), makes it unliklely such art is also going to be depthful or complicated or anything approaching artistically interesting. It doesn't have to be. It just has to hit the right buttons and repeat in various ways the idea that Americans are stupid and bullheaded - the underlying implication is that breaking away from British rule&nbsp;was a mistake for which we're still paying.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Coming soon to Picadilly Circus: "The 9/11 Commission: In Three Parts"

       Category: Personal   &nbsp;  In this month's Vanity Fair, Jessica Simpson admits to playing for the camera on the second season of  urlLink MTV's Newlyweds , including exaggerating certain parts of her character like the ditziness that had endeared her to America, until Nick told her to stop (she promises to be better on the third season).  &nbsp;  It's certainly understandable--I'm not sure someone could  not&nbsp;cater  their personality for the cameras after watching themselves for an entire season and having elements of their personality criticized or praised. It's odd, I think, how many people think they have&nbsp;personalities stable enough to withstand close scrutiny and criticism and  not change  (though this idea is big on reality shows--how many times do you hear Real World kids say the key to their personal happiness is "being myself"). In my case, most of the decisions I make regarding my personality are guided by what people think of me, what they tell me they like and what I suspect they don't like.  &nbsp;  It all reminds me of what happened to me in sixth grade, up to which point I'd thought of myself as having a fairly stable set of characteristics that were actually indiciative of who I was (up to that point I also hadn't been popular and hadn't thought much about being (or not being) popular). Then I was told by assorted friends of the girl who the boys&nbsp;in my grade&nbsp;had just recently come to a semi-unanimous conclusion was the "hottest girl in the class," that she liked me and wanted to do something called "go out." We did actually go out (or anyway I remember a series of psychologically scarring affairs others referred to as "dates," and which sometimes involved hiding the fact I'd injured myself on our friend's big backyard trampoline), but I spent most of the&nbsp;next couple months (not to mention the next few years)&nbsp;obsessively combing over every element of myself in an ultimately&nbsp;futile attempt to figure out  what it was exactly that she liked,  and then trying to make sure I didn't change that thing about myself, since maybe at any minute I figured she could stop liking me, if I changed the wrong thing.&nbsp;This included first of all every element of the way I looked: I fanatically kept my hair the same length&nbsp;as it was the day I found out she liked me, and I also tried to dress the same way (my style at the time, I think, involved baggy jeans and a t-shirt ambiguously arranged so as to seem like I'd,  absentmindedly , either tucked it in or not tucked it in but wasn't going to spend time worrying about it either way), and I also tried to set in stone certain elements of the way I walked and talked.  &nbsp;  But it also influenced other parts of my personality. At the time, I had developed a social style which involved being mean to kids who were less popular than me and ridiculing them in public and getting laughs this way. It was just something I was trying out--I didn't know if I liked it and suspected it was cruel--but once I found out the girl liked me I kept doing it for a long time, since, who knows, maybe that's what she liked about me. I also standardized a style of talking back to teachers and other adults, which was maybe impresive to some people--who knew?  &nbsp;  Anyway, the point is what's naive is to think any of us would be able to handle a year's worth of close analysis of our personality (and not just by the hottest girl in Parker's sixth grade class of '03,&nbsp;but by the  whole country ), as Jessica has had, and  not  play up the parts of ourselves we discover people like or find amusing. I'm sure this happens on all reality shows and by now there's enough data we could do some kind of study about the way people change from their first to their second reality show (we could start with Bob Guinea, from the Batchelorette and Batchelor).  &nbsp;  This would surely be an important study and tell us lots of important things, don't you think, DG?

       Category: Fiction   I've been trying to get through James Wood's new book of criticism,  urlLink The Irresponsible Self , but have to admit it's pretty boring so far, despite Wood's brilliant writing and occasionally great insights. I think Laura Miller makes a lot of good points in her  urlLink article for Salon  today about why Wood's new book might be unsatisfying (to me), and what in general is disappointing about many of today's most brilliant book critics (I'm beginning to think Miller is as brilliant as any of them). Summarizing the similar arguments of new books by Wood and fellow New Republic critic Dale Peck, Miller writes the following:  "[Wood and Peck agree] the maximalist novel is too long and too digressive, and it is about ideas not people. (One difference is that Peck thinks this is elitist, while Wood thinks it's not rarefied enough.) If you disagree (and in many, if not all, instances, I do), you hit a wall. 'Infinite Jest,' 'The Corrections' and 'White Teeth' are in fact ripe with humanity, and their digressions and disquisitions are not tiresome but delightful. So there. It is a silly impasse, the one where taste cannot be accounted for and the sides resort to hurling insults."  The point Miller makes throughout the article is basically that Peck and Wood (Harold Bloom could be added to this group) dismiss contemporary literature (the "maximalist novel") without considering the very real differences that exist between different contemporary authors and contemporary novels. The group of Moody, Wallace, Eugenides, Eggers, Julavitz, Ford, Rushdie, Whitehead, Delillo, Zadie Smith, Pynchon et al, is far from monolithic (in many ways many of these writers aren't even similar to each other), but the greatest critics of our time treat them as if they were (Bloom likes some of the older ones like Pynchon, as a rare exception).   The real problem with this is it leads to paralysis in criticism--surely, those who applaud the shallow twists and turns of what Wood calls "hysterical realism" are not helping matters either. The point is, criticism requires wading into individual works and making distinctions--the denunciation of everything since Virginia Woolf as garbage (Peck) or saying contemporary novels don't know anything about "reality" (Wood) may be a matter for broad literay historians, but such overarching theories are very dangerous for critics to hold. Each new work then becomes either proof or an exception to their teleological theories--the feeling I got reading Wood's new book was that I would not be surprised by any of his judgments. As Miller points out, Wood's and Peck's system of criticism is very coherent, but also very dead.  Just for the record, I still think Wood is the best critic out there today, and I agree with 90% of what he has to say about all literature before the last twenty years. Check out Robert Birnbaum's  urlLink interview with Wood here .

       Category: Culture   From the  urlLink New York Times's profile  today of U.S. public enemy #1 (or #2, depending on who you ask), Abu Musab al-Zarqawi:  "Mr. Zarqawi, thought to be 37, grew up fast and hard in Zarqa, a crime-ridden industrial city north of Amman known as Jordan's Detroit.  From his two-story concrete-block house, he looked out on hills dotted with smokestacks. He came from a poor family and has seven sisters and two brothers. His father was a traditional healer. His mother struggled with leukemia. His birth name was Ahmed Fadeel al-Khalayleh.  Childhood friends say he was much like any other boy, chasing soccer balls through gravely streets, doing average work in school, not going to the mosque much. But he liked to fight. 'He was not so big, but he was bold,' said a cousin, Muhammad al-Zawahra.  At 17, family members say, he dropped out of school. Friends said he had started drinking heavily and getting tattoos, both discouraged under Islam. According to Jordanian intelligence reports provided to The Associated Press in Amman, Mr. Zarqawi was jailed in the 1980's for sexual assault, though no additional details were available.  By the time he cleared 20 he was adrift, his family said, and like other young Arab men looking for a cause, he looked northeast, to Afghanistan."  Let's see...Zarqawi grew up in "Jordan's Detroit," changed his name, "liked to fight," dropped out of school at 17, began drinking heavily, railed against cultural traditions, spent some time in jail, and, at the age of 20, was characterized as "adrift" by family and friends. Well, I guess American pop culture hasn't penetrated  quite far enough  into the Middle East. If there had just been some talent scouts around, it sounds like Zarqawi was a perfect candidate to become the  urlLink Arab world's Eminem.    But instead of being discovered by Dr. Dre, Zarqawi linked up with Saleh al-Hami, a guerilla veteran of the Soviet wars intent on launching a holy jihad against the West. Instead of finding a home in the West Coast rap scene, Zarqawi looked "to Afghanistan." Now he wants to kill Eminem along with the rest of us.

      One of these days--soon--I'm going to put up an uber-post analyzing different theories of Bush rhetoric. In the meantime, let's begin gathering in the lines by looking at some lower-level bureaucrats.  Today's nominee is   urlLink Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman  , who announced yesterday that the Administration will overturn Clinton-era legislation that placed nearly 60 million acres of national forest under protection from road-building and logging.  [Finally, a leader who has the guts to take on the nation's unpaved forest problem.]  Veneman broke the news to citizens at a press conference in Idaho. She noted that the old system (forests without roads) involved too much red tape, "The prospect of endless lawsuits represents neither progress nor certainty for communities." Fine. I can understand this sentiment even if I don't agree with it. Moreover, it accords with my preconceptions about Republicans (and, I imagine, their own self images): pro-business, anti-regulation assholes. I'm willing to believe that the prohibition against logging  did  create a wasteful, inefficient, tax-dollar-draining system. And I can't, really, fault them for being themselves.  But why the following comment? "Our announcements today illustrate our commitment to working closely with the nation's governors to meet the needs of local communities, and to maintaining the undeveloped character of the most pristine areas of the national forest system." I don't understand why they even bother making claims like this. Asserting that logging roads will help keep our forests pristine is not only impossibly untrue, it's puzzling. No Administration policy scribe could have reasonably hoped that these fatuous words would appease environmentalists. Anyone who actually values "pristine areas" (and votes those values) will be, prima facie, against logging roads. In other words, they couldn't possibly hope to have convinced either serious environmentalists or anxious soccer moms that this decision would have any favorable effect on the environment.   So, why bother making yourself look like an idiot? In a  Daily Show  world, politicians ought to be more sensitive to how easily their words and actions translate into satire.  (I can't even post  to my own blog without burning through four or five drafts.)  The logging-road rhetoric proves definitively that this Administration really is made up of ideologues convinced of their infallibility: who else but an immodest chump blinded by hubris could fail to anticipate this ridicule?    I have a suggestion.  Why not just come out and say, "Look, we don't give two shits about forests, or woodlands or whatever. And we're in charge, see? We won. These forests are just sitting here, waiting to be logged, and we've got to shell out millions of bucks a year filling out paperwork explaining why they can't be. Screw that. You're not going to like this, but we're doing it. It's more efficient. Those are our principles, take it our leave it."  Instead, what the Administration offered was Democrat-lite.  The Bushies, after intimidating Democrats to incessantly appear stronger on terror, have tempered their own delivery to  appear stronger on the environment.  Politics would be a heck of a lot more engaging if both parties simply let it all hang out.  Republicans should explain Alaskan drilling, logroads, and tax cuts by saying "Hey, join us in our prosperity.  This is a big country.  Help us in devouring the tablescraps of its vast resources. "  Now I'm left with a question.  If the Democrats let it all hang out, what  would  they say?

       Category: Culture   Harold Bloom  urlLink weighs in on the NEA's findings  with a characteristically perceptive essay in today's LA Times (although I'm not sure about the title...). The announcement that "fewer than half of all Americans over the age of 18 now read novels, plays, short stories or poetry, and that only 56.9% have read any book at all in the last year," he writes, "is, of course, to be abhorred. But to call it news, I think, is wrong."  I think he's right about this--there's nothing alarming about fewer than half of Americans reading these days, and much less than that reading anything  good . After all, as Bloom points out, this country "has been split into two cultures for many years. If you go back through the history of literacy in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, you'll see that we've always been divisible into readers and nonreaders."  And not only this country. All countries, in fact, and all people are divided into these two cultures, and as Bloom also points out, the divisions are based much less on class, race and education that you'd think. There are simply very few people out there--have always been very few people--who see literature as really a central issue in their lives (or even as a tangential issue). While having a college education probably makes you more likely to read literature as the NEA broadly defines it (as Bloom points out, this includes Stephen King and Danielle Steele), in my experience there is little to suggest people who happen to have been born in higher-income families and attended good schools are more likely to be genuinely interested in fiction than those who were not and did not.  I actually would like to see a real anthropological study about who does read real literature, a detailed breakdown of the, I don't know...maybe 10% of Americans that actually read not just books but good books. I think the specifics of class and gender and family history would be more diverse than people think. It's a vague hypothesis, but I wonder if the strong desire to read can be traced to childhood alienation or trauma--some early confrontation with unfairness or self-doubt, maybe a mildly debilitating lack of confidence or loneliness. It would be hard for any study to ascertain these things, but the point is maybe there's something more wrong with those of us who  do feel strongly  about reading than those that are perfectly content with TV and alcohol.

       Category: Culture    The most alarming statistical development from the  urlLink NEA's new report  on the decline of literary reading has gone pretty much un-reported. Buried in the thirteenth paragraph of the report summary lies this staggering conflageration of findings:   "Contrary to the overall decline in literary reading, the number of people  doing creative writing increased by 30 percent , from 11 million in 1982 to more than 14 million in 2002. However, the  number of people who reported having taken a creative writing class or lesson decreased by 2.2 million during the same time period ."  In other words, Americans neither read nor study literature: they merely write it. I guess this make sense in the context of a culture which teaches artistic genius is just a matter of finding one's own personal voice--i.e. that everyone has the capacity to be "original." There's no need to take a class (i.e. learn how to write) or check out other people's writing (learn how other people have written). Anyway, it demonstrates the paradox of modern creativity--never has there been such a personal value placed on creativity, nor such a small audience for the fruits of its labors.   I wonder if blogs count as creative writing.

       Category: TV   In yet another proof of the adage that life imitates David Foster Wallace's art, little expressionless animal  urlLink Ken Jennings  has racked up $868,960 in his 26 game sweep of this season's Jeopardy boards.  The real story of course is about Jeopardy's ratings which were already up 20% halfway through Jennings' win-streak.   "If the topic is a foreign country, he'll answer in that country's accent, and in answer to one clue about hip-hop music, the ultra-white Ken memorably responded, "What is rap, yo?" Like a hot-dogging ball player insisting on his special end-zone touchdown dance, Jennings will no doubt take heat from some viewers for these stylistic quirks, but what the hell? It's show business, of a sort, and KenJen's antics have once again made Jeopardy!—which I hadn't watched regularly since matching wits with my Dad in high school—required viewing."   A Wallacesque diversion:  Merv Griffin and the current production team at Jeopardy have surely read David Foster Wallace's story.  (Have no doubt: Alec Trebek considers it one of his secret, guilty pleasures.)  While the very fact that they previously imposed a five-win limit on champions demonstrates that they had already considered the alternative--an undelimited streak--I think it's more than possible that Griffin and Co. were tempted by the example of their fictional selves to finally revise the rules of the show.   Obvious differences aside, is Jennings really "the Michael Jordan of trivia"?  I'd like to see statistics on how many 5-day champions were forced into retirement versus how many were actually defeated on their fifth day.  My guess is that many of them would have kept on winning.  Besides, Jennings still hasn't won as much as Brad Rutter of Lancaster, PA, who in the 2001-2002 season, earned "the highest cumulative amount won by a single JEOPARDY! player," $1,155,102 in cash.  Jennings is a Mormon with a wife named Mindy.  (That's almost more Wallace than Wallace himself: an encyclopedic lesbian with an autistic brother is almost already self-parody.)   What to expect later this week from the press : Jennings/Lance Armstrong comparisons.

      "In the dark seclusion between cool tight sheets, his parents' muttering having died away, he would seem for some seconds to stand on his head, having discovered with his left hand a faithful mechanism impossibly sweet, a clench that took him back to infancy, its tight knit of newness before memories overlaid the bliss of being. Into this private darkness had come another, another seeker, and what was being found, clumsily yet unstoppably, was a core self explored by another consiousness."  --p. 82   Why It's Annoying:  If you guessed: John Updike, something having to do with masturbation--you'd be correct here, but it's not all that hard to figure out. There really is no other novelist in American literature who writes things like this and is taken seriously (as in, published in the New Yorker). Passages like the above have made Updike a repeated qualifier for the Literary Review's prestigious " urlLink bad sex in serious fiction award. " For starters, one wonders how ( and why ) he avoids using the word "penis" in this context--wouldn't it be more appropriate than "faithful mechanism" and (oh God)..."core self." Also, one wonders what Updike is talking about when he mentions  standing on his head.  Just read the passage over and over--it gets better each time. There actually are too many things to laugh at here to go on.   What's More Annoying:  How few people laugh at John Updike as a serious writer. particularly how few people laugh at his more recent work, which has become increasingly narcissistic and sexually absurd. He writes sex scenes like an old man remembering youthful sexual encounters he never actually had. Which maybe is exactly what he's doing. For one review that does laugh at Updike (or should make readers laugh at Updike), check out David Foster Wallace's  urlLink famous takedown of Toward the End of Time , hopefully but not likely one of Updike's last novels.

      literary slash essay  urlLink magazine called n+1  launched this week. In the first issue, there is a very  urlLink funny essay  about George Bush, a  urlLink fantastic review  of the media’s response to Fahrenheit 9/11 and a perceptive piece on the regressive avant-garde represented by McSweeneys. There’s also a hilarious thing about how America should  urlLink make Palestine its 51st state . The magazine’s sort of a competitor for The Believer. Its tone is more political, less ashamed to be intellectual, and less childish. It is not afraid to be a little contemptuous of people who aren’t smart or who don't think seriously about at least some things. It is probably a needed antidote to the kindergartinization of culture being carried out by the Eggersheads.

      Here’s my question for the day: is there any social convention we have that’s  stupider  than opening doors for each other? I just went out to go to the bathroom – as I opened the office’s front door (which leads to the hallway where the bathrooms are), I noticed a senior female from my workplace was about halfway down the hall. Should I hold the door for her, or should I not? Well, it was going to be several seconds if I held it – she was not anywhere near the door. But, if I just let the door close and passed her in the hall, would that be wrong?  I decided to stand with my back to the door, ushering her forward like a matador towards our office. She, of course, being uncomfortable with having the door held for her even though she was nowhere near it, started to kind of skip, or half-run, or, maybe gallop, towards me. She was faced with the challenge of not wanting to look like my holding the door was altering in any way her normal gait, but at the same time also not wanting to give the impression she insolently expected doors held open for her for unreasonable expanses of time while she mosied lethargically through the world. As she got closer, we both smiled awkwardly. Then, sidling past me, she stepped on my foot and almost tripped. This was even more awkward. She said “thanks,” but I don’t think she meant it.  Now, there are a lot of stupid social conventions.  Here are a few:  - having to wear dress clothes to work - not being able to put your elbows on the table when you’re eating even though everyone knows it’s more comfortable to put your elbows on the table while you’re eating - not being able to ask people whether they like you or not and then if so how much (they like you) in comparison to other people they like, even though that’s all you ever think about while you’re talking to them - religion - having to ask people questions about vacations they’ve gone on - (obviously) being expected to put a toilet seat down, as it it's too much for someone to check before they sit - holding the elevator even when there are four other ones also on the ground floor all of which the person you’re holding the elevator for would rather use since then they could check themselves out in the mirror glass in peace - having to write thank you notes  These are all defined by being things we do which are unpleasant (or at least prevent things that could be pleasant) and which have no tangible benefit for anyone. There are probably a lot of others. Still, my point is, there are none worse than opening doors, not because it is so difficult, but because it includes so many both physical and social variations of awkwardness, and, even more importantly, because there is  no way it is an enjoyable experience for either of the parties involved  – no more for the door holder than for the walker. I know, personally, I have never enjoyed myself and only been stressed out by situations in which it is clear someone is opening a door for me. I wonder: what are my responsibilities? What will I do at the next door? I better stay in front, I can't let them open two in a row.  Furthermore, it's ridiculous to deny the whole door opening thing gestures at least vaguely towards several gradations of social division and gender inequality. It is never clear whether I should hold the door for boys our own age, for instance. Could this be construed as gay? Is it more right for me to hold the door open for the CEO of my company than for the janitor, even though they are the same age? Should I take the extravagant step, in an elevator, of standing aside while everyone exits, even if I am in front? (it seems to me this tends to cause more confusion than happiness, but then I’m always disturbed when I walk out and see someone else in the elevator doing it – is he better than me?)

      I saw Avenue Q last night. I won the lottery 2 hours before the show and got front row seats for $20. Awesome. Avenue Q is the puppet show that won the Tony for best musical. The show was and clever and witty and charming. The story is weak and cliched but it sort of works because they're puppets and watching puppets do generic people things is funny. But the story lacked any sort of dramatic weight, and the devices used for solving plot issues were total cop outs. I.E. one character randomly has $10,000,000 to spare. (Still there are these two characters called the Bad Advice Bears that are kick ass)  So my real question, how did Avenue Q win best musical over "Wicked?" "Wicked" is the musical that tells the story of the Wicked Witch of the West before she met Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz." "Wicked" might be the best musical ever. The conflicts are epic, the music is amazing, and I cried like every third minute. I've actually seen Wicked a couple times more. Has anyone seen both, and can answer how Avenue Q could possible be better?  Also there is a moment in Avenue Q I find really annoying. The main character "Princeton," an obvious embodiment of the show's writer, makes a reference to how he is going to write a show, thus referring to the writing of Avenue Q. I feel like that is such a juvenile thing to do. I remember the movie "Judy Berlin" also did that and it was just so lame.   I recommend "Wicked" to all. Don't see "Judy Berlin."

       urlLink    In case anyone else is interested in what people in Washington are interested in, above is a picture of Jessica Cutler, the Capitol Hill intern who kept a blog about how she slept with a bunch of government and Bush administration officials. Then she was outed by another blog and lost her job and signed a book deal and did a spread in Playboy.  She was the subject of a major  urlLink article in the Washington Post  this weekend, which was filled with unbelievably hysterical statements like this:   "She's a sign," says Daniel Yankelovich, the pollster and analyst who has been studying American values for 50 years. He means a sign of our times, as is Jessica's frumpy 21-year-old contemporary, Pfc. Lynndie England, whose gleeful mugging for the cameras as she mocked naked Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib unsettled the national conscience. Both women have left many people questioning: How did we get here?  Anyway, one unexamined angle from the article that occurred to me, being someone who now has a blog, was whether or how the blog might have influenced Jessica's experience, as in, driven her to do some exciting things others might be interested in. Here was Cutler's first blog entry:  "I have a 'glamour job on the hill. That is, I could not care less about gov or politics, but working for a Senator looks good on my resume. And these marble hallways are such great places for meeting boys and showing off my outfits."  Okay...not exactly the most interesting piece of reportage. She probably figured: "I'd better sleep with some Bush administration officials so I can spice this thing up." I can understand. I'm hoping my workplace soft ball team makes the Senate League playoffs for exactly the same reason.

      The first Paris Review ever  urlLink not edited by George Plimpton  hits bookstores today. The new editor is Brigid Hughes, 32, who started as an intern at the Review in 1994, her first gig out of college, and rose to managing editor by 2000. Now, of course, she has the one job I might consider giving up a couple of my limbs for. The summer issue includes interviews with  urlLink Haruki Murakami  and sometimes children’s author  urlLink Paula Fox . I’m embarrassed to admit I’ve barely heard of Fox, although this  urlLink review from 2002  makes her sound like one of the dark geniuses of American prose fiction. She has a fine  urlLink piece of nonfiction  published elsewhere in Hughes’s review, but what really got me was this part of her author interview:   INTERVIEWER:  Probably every writer has to come to that differently. Clearly your childhood was full of those moments, walking past doors like that. You seem particularly to have absorbed the various ways adults manage to live with the lies they tell themselves.   FOX:  At some point I began to value "truth," that elusive thing, more as I grew older—not only story. I recall lying on a bed, looking at a manuscript on the floor as I reached to turn pages, and thinking to myself, I must mean everything I say, every word, and feeling it as a profound moment in my writing life. When my son was little he went to a convent school for the first year. They're very good schools, and the public schools were very bad where we lived, around Columbia University. One day when I went to get Gabe, who was five or six, I heard a woman talking to her child. She was a nice woman, I'm sure. She was talking to her eight- or nine-year-old child on the way home up the slope of the hill, and she was saying, "When it's this time of year"—it was autumn—"I think of the leaves in New England, and I think how beautiful they are." And I thought, That's false what she said. I could hear the falsity. She wanted to make her child feel that she was an appreciator of beauty so the child would appreciate the beauty of the leaves turning. I thought, Why doesn't she really talk to her? I mean, it's obvious that she had good intentions, but also I realized that good intentions are part of the whole problem. You know? Even in virtuous people, falseness can corrupt their virtue. I know that sounds very stern, like a set of laws, and I don't always obey those laws myself, but I am very much aware of them, in a certain sense. I know that they aren't laws for many people. But they are for me. They get stronger and stronger as I get older.  It’s so refreshing to see an author say this – I mean, to admit that something as antiquated as “truth” might actually exist. It’s not just a matter of subjective opinion and shifting signifiers. It may be "elusive," but it can be gotten at and a wise person knows when they have it and when they don't. And there's a positive value to getting it and a negative value to not getting it. I like the idea Fox goes through her manuscripts and makes sure she means everything she says. A lot of authors would have better novels if they did this. For some reason Zadie Smith springs especially to mind.

      Okay Zeke, so I saw  urlLink Garden State  on Sunday, and here's my assessment of Natalie Portman's character, Sam:   Lovable:  20%  Interesting:  10%  Annoying:  70%  Believable as a person who would actually exist in the world : 0%  Obviously, I didn't fall for her the way you (and many other people I've talked to) did. For the most part, I found her whole character contrived and childish and dumb. She seemed to come from nowhere and know nothing. I thought it was believable the guy would fall for her only because he was kind of dumb too and they shared a profoundly melodramatic sense of their own insconsequential  lives - in fact, her first action signaled the movie's essentially superficial point of view: all you need to change your life is really the right pop song at the right time.  As for the 20 percent of the time when Sam was "lovable," (mostly the one scene when they first go to her house and bury the hamster, and then the little speech she makes near the end about the main guy "protecting" her, which I did think was cute), here's the thing: the reason she's so lovable is because she does have somewhat "interesting" things to say, or at the very least an interesting way of saying things, and the reason she has interesting things to say, I think, is because her lines are written, and the character is acted, by persons significantly smarter and more "interesting" than the character she plays would actually be. I don't have a problem with this - it's what happens in movies, but I just think it makes the analogy to real life untenable. In real life, a person with the attributes of Portman's character would be insufferable (even if you  liked  the character in the movie). Without scripted lines and actions, I think her faux-innocence and naivete and semi unstated anti-intellectualism would wear thin faster than one of her epileptic seizures (which, by the way, I think the movie owed us at least one).  As you can probably tell, this movie didn't exactly leave me reaching for a cup to catch my tears.

                I just saw “Garden State” by Zach Braff. The movie is good. Really as long as I identify with the guy, and I want the girl, I could watch two people fall in love over and over again on screen for the rest of my life. But suddenly in the third act Zach Braff’s character “Andrew Largeman” gets all preachy and gives us the answers to life’s problems in like six straight scenes. It’s ridiculous. Still I liked it and you should see it. But this is not a movie review, so I’ll move on.          A couple hours later I just keep thinking about Natalie Portman’s character “Sam.” She’s in her mid-twenties, lives with her mom, works at law firm presumably as some sort of para-legal, and raises hamsters. She doesn’t seem to have accomplished all that much. She doesn’t have any exciting goals. And she really doesn’t seem all that interesting. But still, for two hours I totally fell in love with “Sam.”  	So here’s the dichotomy I am wondering about, “lovability vs. being interesting.” Growing up, every friend I had was based on my loving them, just their honesty in perception, their excitement for the day, their great laughs, and their awesome magnetism. Like Sam, in my eyes, they were just so lovable. I couldn’t help it. And I followed this instinct probably from the day I was born through boarding school. 	But somewhere in college, this started to change. The most lovable people started to frustrate me, bore me, and make me mad.  I realized that many of my old friends, if I were to meet them again, we probably would not end up friends again.  	I wanted interesting friends. I wanted people who had interesting lives, did interesting things, had interesting goals, and said interesting stuff that made me think. But this “interesting” quality always seems to come at a cost. There is always something about the interesting people I don't like, something below the surface that just sort of repulses me. 	It scares that maybe these two qualities can’t exist. For a time I thought that maybe I had both these qualities. But then I realized, that it’s on my good days that I’m lovable, and on my bad days that I become interesting. Never at the same time.

      Jon asked me to start posting on his blog, “The Culture Industry.” Part of me says, “totally awesome,” and part of me says, “what’s the point? I’ve got better things to do.” My first realization – actually, I don’t have better things to do. My second realization – I’ll just give my blog postings a personal purpose. So here it goes.  Dear Alex Kerry,  (It might be possible that Alex Kerry doesn’t read this particular blog, so whoever might know Alex Kerry, please show her my posting)  You should be my girlfriend. I have read your Democratic National Convention speech over and over again, and we’re totally right for each other. The parts about the hamster and about being an American give me goose bumps. I was going to vote for Ralph Nader like I did in the last election.  It’s my way of acting like I’m cooler than politics and all the people that get angry about political stuff. But after seeing your speech, I am definitely voting for your dad, John Kerry.  Here are the pros  (I did a little internet research into your life – please don’t be weirded out – it didn’t take much effort) 	-You went to Brown - I went to Brown         -You're interested in politics - I majored in comparative politics. 	-You went to AFI and are pursuing a life in film. 	-I also work in film and am going to apply to AFI and a couple other schools next year. -You grew up in New England – I also grew up in New England (Connecticut) -I live in New York in the East Village. I don’t know where you live, but I bet you like New York.  Here are the cons –  	-You are seven years older than me.  Doesn’t bother me if it doesn’t bother you. I’d like to say I’m mature for my age, but that’s really a debatable topic. 	-I am a Yankees fan – You are most likely a Red Sox fan. (this might be more of a problem than you might anticipate – I really don’t like the Red Sox) 	-The tabloids say you are dating John Cusack. It’s really your choice whether this is a problem or not. I told my brother about my plan to go out with you, he said his money is with Cusack. But my mom said I’m definitely a better catch than Cusack. 	-Not that I have anything against Cusack, but I once held a stereo over my head, and I looked totally just as cool.  One more pro – All my family members are better looking than Joan Cusack.  So Alex, if you’re interested, post a response to this, and we can go on a date or something. Actually I’m sort of petrified of the whole dating process, so maybe we could arrange some sort of social gathering amongst friends where we could hang out and I could totally impress you.    Rock On, Zeke

       Category: Food   More on food: David Foster Wallace has written an  urlLink article on the Maine Lobster Festival for Gourmet Magazine . There seems to have been some wrangling over editorial control:  "I wasn't quite prepared for this," admits  urlLink Gourmet editor  Ruth Reichl. "I was blown away. I never in a million years thought this particular issue" --  lobster-cide  -- "would come up." In her note at the front of the magazine, she describes the article as "hilarious, thought-provoking,  very uncomfortable ."  Sounds a little like everything else Wallace has written. I can't wait.  p.s. Apparently it's out already (but not available online). Here are  urlLink some reactions  from some shellshocked sounding Gourmet readers.

      Steven Shapin reviews diet books this week for the  urlLink London Book Review . Here's a preview:  "Most fundamentally, eating is a moment of ontological transformation: it is when what is not-you - not rational and not animate, at the time you consume it - starts to become you, the rational being which ultimately decides what stuff to consume. Flesh becomes reason at one remove, and every supper is, in that sense, eucharistic. We are, literally and fundamentally, what we eat. The material transformation is simultaneous with the possibility of social and moral transformation or the advertisement of the social and moral states to which you are laying claim. A temperate person is someone who eats temperately; a posh and powerful person is someone who gets an 8 o'clock table at the Ivy; respect for life is shown by vegetarianism; red-blooded machismo by the consumption of red meat; your friends eat with you at home; you have coffee with your colleagues; the High eat later than the Low, thus making a standard display of delayed gratification and acquiring the associated status of those who can wait an hour longer than others for their food. Self-nourishing and self-fashioning both happen at the table."  So next time someone asks you what you want to eat for dinner, say: "you mean, how do I want to ontologically transform myself before I go to bed tonight?" Still, I'm for anything that makes eating sound so important. ( urlLink Sarah , too bad you didn't have this quote to put in your yearbook).

       Category: Literature   "This was July and the July dirt tasted even more like sweetened metal than the dirt of June or May. Something in the growing crops unleashed a metallic life that only began to dissipate in mid-August, and by harvest time that life would be gone altogether, replaced by a sour moldiness he associated with the coming of fall and winter, the end of a relationship he had begun with the first taste of dirt back in March, before the first hard spring rain. Now, with the sun gone and no moon and the darkness having taken a nice hold of him, he walked to the end of the row, holding the mule by the tail. In the clearing he dropped the tail and moved around the mule toward the barn."  Above is a  urlLink passage  from Edward Jones's   urlLink The Known World  , which I bought at Barnes & Noble last week after seeing it had been awarded the Pullitzer Prize and was heralded on the cover by well-respected Washington Post book critic Jonathan Yardley as being "the best new work of American fiction to cross my desk in years."  urlLink Several other  big name  urlLink reviewers  have chimed in with high praise for this book as well.  After about 50 pages, it's clear Jones's historical fiction, focusing on a black slave working for a former black slave in Virginia, is an abundently amateurish effort. I chose the above passage partly because it demonstrates Jones at his best as a writer - he is moderately talented at descriptions - but also the weakness of this novel and novels like it and then also I think the appeal such books have for critics.  Jones has his protagonist (in the above passage) in what could be a very moving moment, a slave bending down and tasting the dirt of a field. He completely ruins it, however, by overloading the passage with unnecessary details: do we really need to know, and would the character really be thinking of the exact months and dates and corresponding seasonal effects which impact the taste of the dirt throughout the year as he bends over and tastes the dirt before ending his day and going home to his family?  I don't know, maybe he would think of those things, but the fact remains the detail overload and the absurd specificity of the details makes the passage more about the author than his protagonist. We think: wow, doesn't Edward P. Jones know just about everything about the life of a slave in antebellum Virginia. Isn't that something. What detail!  Of course, the above passage is quoted or referred to in a couple of the reviews I read - such detail is part of the reason so many critics heralded the novel as a literary masterpiece. What I think is really the issue is that even some of the most literate of today's book people have given over to the idea that a novel's chief purpose is to show us something, culturally or geographically or historically, which we don't know.  urlLink Yardley writes :  " The Known World  ventures into previously uncovered places and shines a light on them that is at once blindingly bright and surpassingly warm."  Indeed, to "shine a light into previously uncovered places" has become a virture in and of itself for modern fiction - reading is equated with traveling, a way to see or experience things we wouldn't otherwise see. This is exactly contrary to what, in my opinion, great reading ought to entail: a confrontation with what we  already  know, with what is familiar but lost. The "blinding light" should shine on us, on our own selves, not on worlds we'll never visit. This isn't an argument against historical fiction, but it does mean that merely accurately or even insightfully evoking a particular historical period is not in and of itself a worthy task for a fiction writer. I'm sure reviewers of  The Known World  would argue Jones does more than this, but after about 50 pages I was struck by how much of the author's time is spent proving his knowledge of the landscape. This was unbelievably uninteresting to me.  The book's title, in fact, becomes a kind of taunt: the author surely means his title as a comment on the small world inhabited his characters "know," but the book is less a description of that world than it is a performance of the author's voluminous knowledge about it. The author, Edward Jones, is showing the reader, me, how much he "knows" about the the world of antebellum Virginia slavery. The title is comment on  his  intellectual activity: the world is "known" because Jones has clearly taken the time to get to know it.  A known world, though, is also a dead world. It is a static system devoid of dramatic possibilities, deadened by its own overload of factual data. I hope reviewers will start encouraging contemporary writers to get out of such a world, rather than praising them for knowing it so well.

       Category: Culture   Well, Pamela Anderson has finally  urlLink written a novel , thank God. Up until now, we had thought her talents were limited to starring in the most popular TV shows of all time - it turns out there's more. The reviewers, of course, have lined up to  urlLink pan the novel  in language they consider ironic or sarcastic or at the very least smartly condescending, I guess. From  urlLink The Guardian :  "The cover features a naked spread of the author, with judiciously placed white stars to avoid obscenity suits. And there is another 'bonus' spread on the inside of the cover (minus all that pesky writing covering up the air-brushed flesh). 'Find out what happens when the A-list meets the D-cup,' the blurb promises. Proust this is not."   Proust this is not . Wow, how's that to deflate your expectations. Well, I'll tell you, it didn't dampen my enthusiasm for the book one bit, especially after I read this  urlLink supposedly tepid plot summary :  "The first chapter features ho-hum teen lesbian sex and probably goes downhill from there if I'd bothered reading past. Maybe if, I dunno, Barbi Benton wrote a novel I'd be more inclined to read it, but I rather doubt it."  Downhill from teen lesbian sex? That's like chiding Hamlet for going downhill after the "To Be or Not To Be" monologue. I mean, sometimes down is the only way to go. That's not a reason to knock the book.  Anyway, what are these reviewers attempting to demonstrate - that they're more literate than Pamela Anderson? The Guardian reviewer, actually, eventually admits " Star  is not badly written, as trash goes. Some observations are genuinely witty." He hedges though: "One wonders, though, whether Ms Anderson's fans are  really the kind of people  who can be bothered to read a book."  It would almost give this review too much credit to go into the absurdly false dichotemy this final statement sets up, as if book readers and Pamela Anderson fans are mutually exclusive species. I'll just say this: it's been a bad summer for fiction, but I know one book reader who's got a new novel at the top of his summer list.  Here's a promising  urlLink exerpt  from Chapter One.
