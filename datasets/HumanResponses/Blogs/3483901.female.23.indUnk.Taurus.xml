      Like my PG rated title? Never know when a 13 year old my stumble across my blog. Little fuckers. Oops. Um....anyway, nothing much has happened lately. My life is very uneventful, which is sad since I live in Las Vegas. I do see some very interesting things here. Things you would never see in Colorado. Like the following: 1.A dancing Santa on the corner of major intersection. 2.A Walgreen's shopping cart right outside my door (my future home) 3.Being able to hire a Mexican to wash my car at the do-it-yourself carwash (they don't have drive thru car washes here, crazy stuff). 4.A cracked out, hitch-hiking couple screaming at each other on the side of the road. 5.A homeless man with a "Why lie? I need a beer" sign on the same corner everyday. (I always give him money) 6.A homeless man in a wheelchair on the opposite corner of the beer man with some sign asking for money (I never give him any)  There are others, but I'm too lazy to think what they are.  God, I have no motivation to do this right now. I'm only doing to amuse Carissa. However, I'm putting myself to sleep right now, so I don't think I could amuse anyway at the moment. I have to go to Hell (also known as work) here in awhile and I'm dreading every second of it. I work with a bunch of fire-breathing retards and because of that, I'm on the verge of insanity. Don't be surprised if my next blog is written inside a jailcell. Do they get computers in jail? Probably. I bet they have nice Sony Vaio laptops. Fuckers.  A friend of a friend gave me a kitten a few days ago. I named him Jagermeister. All he does is eat, sleep, meow, and bite at my philanges. Philanges are toes and fingers right? Correct me if I'm wrong.  I really need money for school. If I was still a virgin, I would sell my virginity on Ebay. Didn't someone do that? Uh, yeah....I'm gonna go now. My hair is wet and the AC is on, so I'm starting to feel like an ice-haired medusa. Adios ya'll.

      For the past 96 hours I have been in Phoenix visiting my parents (I actually had to get a calculator out to figure that out-so much for college). I love seeing them and all, but damn am I bored. I think it's because I am stuck here and I don't have the choice of being social. From what I hear Phoenix is a happening place. Actually I didn't hear that, I've just seen too many Elima-date episodes. Anyway, I flew so I don't have a vehicle. I could borrow my moms, but where would I go? I would probably end up at a bar, but I couldn't drink because I would have to drive home. Drinking and driving in my mom's Accord definetely don't mix (I would be disowned). So I'd go to a bar, have a glass of water (maybe tea if I'm feeling frisky), probably get hit on by some dirty homeless man, go to the bathroom, vomit, and proceed to go home. Sounds fun, let me find her keys.  I shouldn't bitch. My mom has done more than enough to entertain me. Pedicures, massages, facials, nice dinners, aloe vera for my wicked-one sided sunburn, and plenty of coffee. I appreciate it all, but I can only spend so many nights on the internet before I go crazy. What the hell am I talking about? I remember countless nights of staying up until 4am talking to god knows who. And I loved it. I wonder what happened? Let's see:(1)My computer gets shittier and shittier by the day (2)I turned 21 (3)I slowly lost touch with all my fellow internet geeks (4)I met a boy, fell in love, and moved in with him. I think that last one is the kicker. It's amazing what having a boyfriend will do to you, but that's a whole other story.  At least my parents have the fast internet connection. On my computer I can view maybe 10 websites, then the beast freezes up on me and I'm forced to kick the shit out of it(note: Compaq's keyboards are the Tuff-Sheds of all keyboards). Because of all this, I have been looking to buy a new computer. I have been approved for a $1500 Dell credit card, I just don't know if I can really afford the additional monthly payments. I'd probably have to spend $30-$40 a month, that means I would have to give up buying 2 t-shirts or about 13 fast food meals a month(hello Mr. Calculator again). I need to go on a diet anyway, so maybe this will be a little incentive.  Holy shit! I have just added up the total amount I have spent on fast food/restaurants since April 12 is $280.67. That's like $30 a day and that doesn't even include what I have paid for in cash. Screw the diet, I need to stop eating that crap to save money. So maybe I'll buy the computer and minimize the eating out. I hate Jack in the Box. I just reminded myself of a series of books I just read: Confessions of a Shopaholic and the two books after that, which I won't waste your time with the names. It's about a girl that has a serious shopping problem and finds ways to justify everything she buys. I feel like I just did that with the computer. I think I have the determination to actually do as I say. I hope so anyway. Actually, I just really want the computer. Maybe I'll get rid of my $30/month water cooler also. Maybe I'll get a second job passing out the hooker ads on the strip like I said I was going to. We shall see.

      Okay, so since I am bored to death, I decided to try this blog thing. Normally I wouldn't do this, because I hate to write, but I had a stoke of inspiration...from an away message on AIM.  Not that anyone cares (I know I don't) and maybe I'm just totally out of date, but it seems that the word of the year is Couture. I don't know what the hell it means, but I have an idea that it deals with fashion. I think this because I've heard/seen it from two fashion-y people: Ashley (where I got my inspiration) and from that "everything on me has been surgically enhanced" old model biatch from that America's Next Top Model show. Anyway, I could look it up in the dictionary to see what it means, but during the summer I try to stay away from anything educational, so screw that.  Damnit, I forgot what the whole point of my point is. I need to lay off the wine. Um..........let me think. I hate myself right now for ever trying pot. It's true kids--marijuana effects the memory. My mom told me today that she thinks they should legalize all drugs, damn hippie. Just kidding, she's too young to be a hippie. I just realized that maybe its not the pot, maybe I have that adult ADHD. I saw a commercial about it and it just seemed to call to me. I bet thats how Ashley and face-lift lady feels when they talk about couture.  Aha!!!!Attention all potheads:::::Are you trying to remember something but can't because you smoke too much? Well, I have discovered the remedy:year old Carlo Rossi wine!!! I took a sip and instantly remembered the whole point of my point. Actually, this probably will only work for me because my point involved alcohol. Here goes....  So, why do I care what couture is? Well, as easy-going and non-shallow I try to be, deep down I am a money hungry bitch. Why the hell should I care what couture is? I know I'm not it (or dress like it?), but I'm curious because it sounds expensive. This goes along with other things in my life, like: I want a Louis Vuitton bag, not because I think they are cute, but because they're the thing to have; I always say that someday I'll own designer clothes, even though now I cringe at buying a $15 Roxy tank top; I want an Escalade, even though it is a gas-guzzling POS; I want to learn how to golf, even though in junior high we had a golfing unit and I always hit the ball backwards; and last but not least, I want to start hanging out at martini bars.   What's wrong with that, you may ask. Well, I hate any and all martinis. I hate gin. It reminds me of a party I went to when I lived in Steamboat Springs. There was nothing but a keg and a bottle of gin in the house. I was desperate to get drunk (a true sign of alcoholism) and I hate beer, so I bust out the gin. There was nothing to chase it with, so I poured some in this little toothpick holder that was shaped like a boot, bit the two ends off a Twizzler, put it in my boot and started drinking the gin through the twizzler. It tasted like pure ass. Needless to say, I got hammered and I think I ended up hooking up with some dirty dude with the nickname of Sloth (like from The Goonies). I'm going to go throw up now.  So now that I have resurfaced some horrible memories, I leave on this note: I am a rich, bitch stuck in a poor girls body. Maybe some day I'll have all those materialitic things, but I'll also have my white-trash past to beat me back into reality.   It is time for a refill....

      Summer is almost over and it's very depressing. I'm not looking forward to spending all my time off from work at school again. I'm really enjoy my lazy days off. Last night, I stayed up until 5:30am reading a book, then I woke up at 8, went to work for 1/2 an hour, came back home and passed out until about 2:30. It was great. I could spend my life doing that. Then I would get way fat. I need to go work out. Carissa, you need to come out here and make me motivated. You're all I have (tear!). I'm just kidding. Also, you need to call me whore. I've been trying to call for a couple of weeks now.  Anyway, it's a day later now. It' s hard for me to focus on this damn thing. Like right now, I just woke up from a nice little nap, but I'm still all exhausted and all I want to do is sleep. My dumb blood sugar has been really low now for a few days and its not getting better. I basically feel nervous, and every once in awhile I feel the urge to puke and then I can't breath very well and then I feel like I'm gonna faint. I know I need to eat, but just looking at food makes me want to hurl. Maybe I'm really just becoming anorexic and its all subconsious. Nah, I couldn't live without my chesseburgers (hurl now). Maybe all that eating has officially turned me diabetic. God, that would really suck.  Boo.....so Jess has been gone all week and I'm sad to say, it has been nice. Hopefully he'll never see this, but I'm really thinking its time we take a little break. We've had a really good run, but I don't think either one of us is ready for the relation ship we have. I just don't want to break up with him because I know I would regret it for the rest of my life. He's so good to me, but of course my dumbass has to ruin everything. We'll see. We have one more month of living together, maybe things will get better.  Happier topic, the Devil (also know as my district manager) is stepping down from her position. Thank you Jesus! That woman is seriously the worst person I have ever met and I really wouldn't be all that upset if she got stranded on some deserted island (with plenty of food and water of course). I'm hoping that work won't suck so bad now. Finding a new job is not easy. I'm smart and semi-educated, but no one likes to hire college kids. Apparently, working around a school schedule is a really difficult task. Well potential employers, you can all fuck off because someday, I'll show you all. When I have my own super bank, I won't let you open an account with me. That'll show them. Yeah right.  So I have some eye candy at work finally. I would never date one of my employees or anything, but this guy in unbelievable. Totally Jamie. He's got spikey hair, gauged ears, and a labret piercing (which normally I don't like, but he looks good in it). He's a little odd, but fun to talk to. At least he could make work a little more interesting, nothing wrong with that. It will be like in high school. Most of the time, my only motivation to get out of bed and actually go to school was to see whoever I was pursuing at the time. It's like a reason to do my hair in the morning. That's horrible that I say this, it should be my boyfriend that gets me up in the morning, but no, it's not. I think that might be a good sign it's over. That and I was almost tempted to meet a guy I have been talking to on the internet for awhile. He was totally cool and I actually saw like a friendship developing, but I pissed him off (I'm good at that) and he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Oh well, life goes on. I'm super cold, so I'm gonna go. Bya.

      Ugh....I'm never drinking again. Last night I went to this club called the Beach. It's kinda shitty, but ladies get in free and drink free until 11, so I was stoked. Anyway, we got there at 10, so I had one hour to drink as many free drinks as I could. I ended up chugging four, then later had a couple shots. One of the shots was from those hot guys that walk around all buff like with a bottle of some sort of tasty poison(Ashley would uh, for lack of a better term, cream her pants). I had to get on my knees and he made me touch his ass. I felt like a white trash, 30 year old that couldn't get any action. I don't know why exactly, but the whole experience was traumatizing. Anyway, we danced for a few hours and my ass was still furshnickered when it was time to leave, so Karen took me home and let me pass out on her couch. The next morning I woke up and had no idea where I was for a few seconds. I must say, that is a pretty scary feeling.  So it wasn't a very exciting night, however I did have to suffer through the day with a really nasty hangover. It's 1 in the morning and I still feel like poo poo. We're supposed to try this new club at treasure island tomorrow, but my ass is dirt poor and I'm not sure if I'm ready to drink like that again. I guess I could play sober, but where is the fun in that? Sniff, sniff....i smell weed. My roommate must be home, maybe I'll go play. Nah, I'd rather hole up in my room and not be social right now. I think it's actually my bedtime. I keep looking at the book I'm reading and it's&nbsp;way more appealling than this blog. So live long and prosper (or something). Nighty night night.

      I am such a loser. Everyone is at Gabe's tonight playing pool and drinking and stuff, but because I'm wore out from work and I have to be back there at 8 in the morning, I stayed at home and got on the internet. Which isn't too bad. I am experimenting with my new computer&nbsp; (yea!!!!). Either way, getting old sucks ass.   Yesterday was Jamie gets cool stuff day. I got my computer and my camera in the mail and Jess finally got a security system and my CD player put in my car. I felt rich for like 2 hours yesterday. Then I looked at my checkbook and saw the whopping $25 in there and that forced me back into reality. Hmm...I'm gonna be a nerd and upload some pictures of my kitty. If I can figure out how.   Ugh...nevermind. You have to download some program and I don't feel like doing that right now. I'm gonna save this and go eat. I shall return soon....   ...2 Days Later  So much for returning soon. Jess just left for Colorado for a week. This is gonna be the first time he's left me alone for more than a few days in a long time. We'll see how that goes. I'm gonna party it up man. It will be like being single, but not really. Like I can go dancing and not have to come home feeling guilty just because I danced with some dude in a drunken stupor. I can be freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.   Hey Ashley, I need to get your your blog site again. My dumbass forgot it again. Thanks.   Random though, yes. I hate my butt. I don't care how many black guys like it (and white guys too apparently), but having a ghetto ass is nothing but trouble. Seriously, like everyday at work, the subject of my ass comes up in some sort of way at least twice. My boss (who is black) might say something about me looking like a "sista" or my sales associate's roommate who says he would like to work at my store so he can watch my "rump-a dump" (or something) all day and the worst: my sales associate's boyfriend who wants me to come to their hottub so he can see my ass naked (sick!). I can't walk through the mall with some sort of dirty remark. "Damn shorty, what are they feeding you?" "Pssshhhh girl, are you mix?" "Mumble mumble girl mumble mumble mumble ass." Or my ever favorite:"Jamie, do you like chicken?"   The very worst part about it is buying jeans. I can't even explaing the issues I have. I am 4'11'' with a size nine ass and a size five waist. So when I buy my jeans, I have to buy a size nine. That means the waist is going to stick out like 3 inches in the back. Hello ass crack!!!! Even if I put a belt on, I can't catch a break. The waist gets all bunched together and plops out from under the belt. There are pants called Applebottle jeans by Nelly that are made for girls with big asses and little wasits. I checked them out and they weren't too bad. However, I don't mean to stereotype, but they look like jeans that black girls wear. I would like a tool wearing most of them. When I went into the store that carries them, the black girl at the counter looked at me all funny, then looked down to my ass, nodded and went back to watching the news (they have TV in their store, I'm jealous). Either way, they are like $80 a pair. I'm too poor for that shiat. I'll just let my crack hang out.   I saw another crazy person in Las Vegas today. We were all driving to Subway and as we were leaving our complex, there was this old lady with a shopping cart crossing the apartment exit. We decided to wait for her thinking that she was almost done crossing. Soon enough, we realized the lady was just inching along VERY slowly. It took her at least a minute just to cross the exit. As she was passing by our car, I could tell she was probably in her fifities. She was so skinny that she looked like one of those starving Ethiopian babies and her skin was burnt to a crisp. AJ said it best: "She looks like the fucken cryptkeeper." It was quite entertaining.   So that's all for now. I'm sure I'll be back "soon"

      Dumby dum...burp! Nothing new lately, surprise surprise! Work is shitty and hot. The damn AC has been broken, so I've been sweating up&nbsp; a storm. I'm gonna have to start putting deoderant on my entire body just so I don't offend. Hmm....last weekend, Matt and Shanna came from Colorado to visit for a day or so and we all went to the strip to ride the monorail. I parked my car at the&nbsp;MGM, planning on taking the monorail to the Sahara, then walking to the Stratosphere, then taking the monorail to Imperial Palace, grabbing a yard margarita, and then walking back to the MGM. We each bought two train passes (back and forth) and started our journey.   We did the Statosphere thing and got back to the monorail station at 11:40 pm, just in time for a security guard to tell us that the last train had left because the place shut down at midnight. At first I thought he was kidding, but no, he wasn't. We were all pretty broke, so we couldn't take a taxi. The busses are nasty as all hell, so were forced to walk. It was late at night and we were in the ghetto. It was hot and I had been on my feet all day. So basically, we were completely miserable the entire 3 mile walk home.&nbsp; F-ing monorail.  However, some interesting things did happen. I found a cool little liquor store that had unique gift baskets. A crackhead lasy told me I looked like I was on meth because of my eyes. "You look like you're in the Twilight Zone," says crackwhore. She then preceeded to ask Jess if he had papers and showed him a huge bud of pot wrapped up in a towel. There was another crackhead screaming at himself and a drunk man that tripped over the curb.   I'm sooooo bored. My computer is supposed to come today, I just hope it comes soon. It will give me something to do. In the meantime, I'm going to go play Simpson's Road Rage. That game is the shiat.

      I am the laziest POS that I know. For the past three days I have holed up in my room playing Super Nintendo and shopping for a computer on the internet (I finally found one, it comes Tuesday!). I guess I did go to the strip yesterday. Jess and I went to Cheeseburger Oasis in the Aladdin(i think thats what it is called). Anyway, we each had a drink there and then we walked down to some ghetto hotel with those huge margaritas. We each got one and walked around Caeser's Palace. We were both wasted by the time we got home. We passed out, Jess puked like always, and later that night I was hungover. It was weird.  Hmmm, I get a free digital camera with my new computer. It'll probably be cheap and shitty, but who cares, at least I'll have one. I can take pictures of my super exciting life and post them for the world to see. I'll spice it up by throwing some S&M pictures in there (eww-what?).  Moving on. I've decided that when I become rich, I'm going to give out a scholarship to middle-class, average, white girls and whoever writes the worst essay wins the most money. I hate the fact that because I to write, I can't get any scholarships. The system sucks. Damn the man! Save the empire!    m     d  I need something to do. I'm gonna look for a job. Peace out.

      Today is a half day and I'm excited. I don't have to go to work until 6pm. Granted, I would much rather never have to go, but a 4 hour shift is nothing compared to an 8 hour shift. Woo hoo. So my 4th of July was very interesting. I had my BBQ. It was fairly uneventful, except my future roommates new man got all psycho about his theory on why people do drugs. He thinks that people try drugs because they are lost and/or depressed. Fuck no, they try it because of peer pressure (cough cough Carissa-brings back good times in the smelly Pontiac). Whatever.   Anyway, after lighting some fireworks, we headed off to this bar called The Whiskey. It was the nicest bar I've been to. The inside was like a typcial fancy smancy bar, but the outside was the coolest. There were beds and couches to sit on and some of the beds even had a little TV built into them. Most of the outside area was surrounded by one of those eternity pools. I had to wonder if any drunkass had ever fallen in. It was free to get in, but the drinks started at $6 a piece. Ouch.  So not long after we got there, Jess claimed that he wasn't drunk enough, so he went to get a double shot of 151. He was beligerant just a few minutes later. He started wandering around, bumping into things. Then he got angry and said I was the worst girlfriend ever and that I'm always cheating on him. I just laughed it off because I knew he was drunk and talking nonsense. I was having a good old time with everyone else there, when all the sudden...dun, dun, dunnn....Jess blows chunks all over the sidewalk in front of everyone. It wasn't even a minute before security was surrounding us giving us the go home evil eye. So we packed our bags and dragged Jess's drunk ass out of there (which wasn't easy, the bar was inside of a huge casino).  I learned my lesson: never take my underage boyfriend to a nice bar until he learns to moderate his drinking. I would have to say this was the worst 4th of July ever. I'll get over it.  I need to eat and I have some coffee on the pot needing to be drank (I bet your jealous now, eh Carissa?) Peace out ya'll.

      My cat is trying to kill me. My arm, my eye, and everywhere else on my body has been sliced to all hell. I'm just one big, walking scab right now. It's sick. I forgot how much fun it was to have a kitten. He keeps trying to eat my pizza too. No way fucker, it's mine! I can't wait until the little shit gets declawed. My life will be complete again.  Today is a sad day. Instead of primping myself for a night of hardcore partying at Ashley's, I'm trying to get motivation to clean my house for a little BBQ I'm having tonight. Fuck cleaning, I want to fly out to Colorado. I wonder how much tickets are? Anyway, back to reality. After the food tonight, I'm going to the Whiskey Bar in Henderson (I think that's what it is called). I hear it's nice, but drinks are expensive. I'm gonna have to wear something skanky so I can get some free drinks. Oh wait, I think Jess is coming. Screw that idea. Owwwww....cat just bit my toe. I'm going to go do my dishes right now. Maybe I'll think of something else to write while I do that.   Nope, nothing. I did find a giant cockroach though. I hate the damn things. They are huge and they refuse to die. You can step on one and they won't have a scratch. Rumor has it that if you chop of their head, they won't die. Thats some shit isn't it? Ugh...well I have cleaning to do and showers to take. Peace out ya'll.
