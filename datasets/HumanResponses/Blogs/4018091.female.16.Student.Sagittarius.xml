          Okay, so yesterday I had so much fun. I went to Talent Night for the cheerleaders at Incarnate Word with Shean, Michael, and Patrick. Three hilarious guys. It was so much fun. The cheerleaders did really good. The dance was too cute. Good job girls..If any of ya'll read this. I sat with Levi and Ashley ((Lay)) the whole time and Levi was all freakin over me. It was kinda funny though. So everyone saw my black hair and I was really surprised by what they said...They all liked it..Unless they were lying to me! haha, who knows? Then afterwards, we went to Whataburger and talked about sex and shit. haha. It was really funny. Then we dropped off Michael then Shean took me home. Later, around 12:30 me and Kristin went to Jack in the Box and when I got home, Cody called me and came over. He was over until about 1:30 I guess. And then I came inside. I didn't freakin go to bed until like 6:30. It was horrible. I hate doing that. On a lighter note, I'm SO excited to go to Brittany's sweet 16, we're going to hit up downtown for sure!! Haha, I can't wait! Well, I'm gonna go. Byee!!

      I went to go get my hair done this morning because I'm tired of my black hair and all the little comments that go along with it. "Pullin an Ashlee Simpson huh? haha" Yeah, it was funny when Brittany said it but not when ten million other people do it to. So, yeah. I'm getting my hair dyed and Patsy ((the hairdresser)) told me that my hair color most likely wouldn't change unless I bleached it. My hair is already almost dead because of my straightener and bleaching it may cause it to fall out. What the hell? I used to be in love with my hair and now it's gonna fall out!? So, she didn't bleach it but the color she put it doesn't change it at all. So next weekend, we're having a bleaching party, but I'm not supposed to like blow dry it or straighten it because it needs as much strength as it can get. Yeah, whatever. I hate my curly hair and I'm not about to not use my straightener. I have an unhealthy relationship with that thing! Haha, yeah. So me and Logan were supposed to have an OFFICIAL pimp/hoe date today before I went to Floores but his bronco broke down and so now I'm gonna go shopping with my mom. YAY?? Haha. Okay, well I'm gonna go straighten my hair! Byee!!
