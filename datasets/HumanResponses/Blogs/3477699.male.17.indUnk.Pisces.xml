      This is the blog to end all blogs. Yes, it has happened. The Manzy has succumbed to the enticing and very trendy spice of the Blogs. After many years of battle, it appears the blogs have won. And with their victory they will exploit me and work me harder then the Egyptians did to the Hebrews.   Well, actually, I won't even bother to post here much this summer, in fact I most likely will not use this again till the begining of the school year, due to the fact that I will not really have a use for it till then(I'm taking Creative Writing I hope this will help me). You'll probably see a lot of sentences with ridiculous amounts of commas that should have been just disected into seperate sentences, but deal with it.   Well what will I be posting in the distant future? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe I'll post stuff that doesn't make sense, or maybe I'll give you step by step details of how my day was, dismissing the fact that you could care less. Whatever it turns out to be, it will be junk. Now that I think about it, this blog should be called toilet, because it will be full of nothing but explosive diarrhea expelled from my brain. What does that make you, oh valiant reader? A fly, swarming to pot to examine this new lump of crap. How beautiful.   On a different note this summer is turning out the same way this year began, with mass groundage. It appears my parents don't appreciate my late arrival home at the pleasant time of 4 am from a spazmanathon to end all spazmanathons(it being the only one, I'm taking much liberty in saying there won't be another one, but I'm hoping for a Manzyathon sometime). I have been finding some good metal though, and this has eased the pain of boredom that is a side effect of grounding.  I have finally gotten my parents to look at my list of parts for the computer, and I do believe that after my dad searches determinedly for a couple years, he will find prices that will suit his tightwad self. Confirmation does have its benefits.  Ack, this blogging business drains far to much energy than it should. There's much more that should be told, but won't, because I am supreme master in the realm of laziness. Plus, my mom is bound to come across this sooner or later which means I will never be able to tell the nailed to the wall, raped, and murdered truth. But alas, who the hell cares about truth anymore, all anyone wants nowadays is something dressed up nicely that won't offend and they'll be happier than a pig in shit.  Woops, my pessimistic "I wish everyone was dead" side is showing.   I've been writing some short stories to deal with the insomnia, two in fact, and I posted them  Here  so if your bored, give em a read if you want.   I've come to the conclusion that cloves kick the proverbial ass of Arnold Schwarzenegger(Back in his "I can't speak english none to well and I am big and buff and I look cool" days. Oh wait, that still applies to today. Well, I think you get my point).  My friend Sean showed me the very morbid but very humorous comic named Johnny the Homicidal Maniac(Made by the creator of The Invader Zim series, so its gotta be great). Anyone with a dark sense of humor or just appreciates being disturbed should go out and buy this comic, its a guaranteed chuckle or two.  B00m ker z00m ruff.

      	Howdy folks, this is my entry de second in the blog universe. If you take the time to look closely (or not closely) you’ll realize that today is Saturday, June 19. If you have any memory or just glance down you’ll also realize that this is only 2 weeks or so since my previous blog entry. 	  If you have any shred of mental capacity you shall yet again realize that I stated in my previous post that I was not going to be posting another blog entry until the end of the summer. At this point you’ll probably scratch your head, double check the date, and maybe count on your fingers before coming to the conclusion that it’s not the end of summer. And you would be right. Few seconds would pass by then your brain would start thinking and asking questions. Questions like,  why is there a second entry? It’s obviously not the end of summer.  And  Maybe it is the end of summer and I didn’t know it?  Followed by  I like pie. When is the next time I can get some? I hope I don’t have school tomorrow.  After a couple volts of brain power have been wasted on such useless thinking, it shall dawn on you that I have lied. I’m not sure what kind of emotion shall arise from you, whether it be anger (Kind of strange if you had this one, I’ll admit), pity (At my obvious lack of will power to keep my word), disappointment (I guess you expected better of me? Mhmm... Go away weirdo), sheer joy (I have no comment on this emotion), or indifference, I really don’t care.   	Why don’t I care? This blog is my domain, my realm, my universe. What I say goes and what I don’t say goes as well. And if I say I didn’t lie, I didn’t, and dammit, that’s the way it goes. Plus it’s really a dumb idea to care what other people think, it really is. What’s there to gain by what other people think? You should probably evaluate yourself before you even consider what other people think. Why do something you don’t like for the sake of others? It’s retarded and pointless, pointless because it helps none at the end. There’s a saying and it goes, “On a long enough time line, the survival rate for anyone drops to zero.” Not a bad quote methinks, and it’s got a good meaning behind it. We all freaking die, no matter who you are, what you do, where you go, your gonna end up rotting in the ground with only maggots and other decomposing creatures to keep you company. If you’re going to die, why waste your little time on this earth worrying about some bullshit fashion trends, social status, impressing others, or whatever else? What you should be wasting your time is awesome stuff, like destroying things, having fun, and most importantly, worshiping me. Yes, this applies to each and every one of you readers out there, because we are all going to expire. Well actually not all of us, I’m going to be immortal because I shall be Supreme Fascista Dictator one day, but this still applies to me because all of you are going to die, making the long-term consequences to my actions obsolete. Well, damn, this was one long, pointless ramble. I’m trying to waste as much of your time as possible, in case you haven’t caught on. Dun dun dun…. Here comes the part where I recount the recent events that occurred between my last post and now. Two-three weeks it has been since me last entry, and many things have happened. Many. And man, they have been crazy, there have been ups, there have been downs, there have been all out weird moments, and there have been all out normal moments. I’ve gotten to know a few people better, made some new friends, lost a friend, got a job (kickass one), and seen ever quest being played. The last one is pretty shocking.  Well let’s see where shall I start, does the beginning sound good? I suppose it does. Does that mean I’ll start there? Nope.  	I’m gonna start with some of my most recent events that have some merit to write down here but not a lot. First thing would have to be my computer. It’s freaking built, two-three years of waiting, blood, tears, sweat, bile, all went into making this comp and I love it like my own child. It’s a pretty comp and fast as hell and is in essence of the world “l337.” I got a pretty sweet setup in my room now, got my comp and desk, a fan, and a kick-ass surround system. All I need now is a mini-fridge room and a couch and I would never have to leave my room ever again. Now onto other things, like cabbages and kings.   	Beginning of the second week of summer (First week for me, I was grounded the first official week) Jas sends me an instant message asking if I wanted to take him to a black lady’s house to get a Louie Vatan Purse (Most likely grossly misspelled and an insult to the flaming homosexual with a lisp that designed it) for 80 bucks. Now I suppose the Louie Gay-Tan purses are some expensive little bitches of purses and 80 bucks is a very good price. Well after a second or two of contemplation (I was bored outta my mind) I decided to go. Jas was all thank you bow down worship allah allah. I wondered why. I soon found out. So I pick him up (and Kyle Martens) up and we head to this chicks house. Little did I know that this lady lived a good 30 minutes to an hour away. It was quite ridiculous but the ride up there and back was quite fun. On the way I blasted them with my usual metal music that most people hate. I saturated them with Windir, Graveworm, Psycroptic, Ensiferum, and Spawn of Possession. They actually liked some of the lighter stuff. Then Kyle recommended possibly one of the greatest radio stations to date (This means a lot coming from me, radio stations freaking suck rocks), 91.7. They played some weird shit but it sounded cool none-the-less. It plays metal at night, which is a big freaking plus. Anyway we get to the ladies house and she’s got the walls laced with Jesus gear and man by Jesus gear I mean much Jesus gear. Most churches are not as decorated as her house was. This pretty much shot my theory to shit of her stealing the Gay-Ton bags, so it’s still a mystery how she sells em for so cheap (They go for about 400-500 bucks I think). Jas’s busts out the cash and we head back and on the way back Jas invites to spend the night at his house. Well we ended up going to his house and I met a guy named Bo that seemed like a pretty cool guy. We watched one of the most bad ass movies in the world, Fight Club. Man, this movie kicks some serious ass. It made me rethink my whole hatred towards Brad Pitt, and when it comes to hating actors, I rarely change my mind on them. If you have not seen this movie, kick your self in the ass for not watching it and go do so, then kick yourself in the ass again just for the hell of it. After this Jas disappears and Kyle, Bo, and Me sit in his TV room and just have some cool shoot-the-shit type guy talk. We did this for awhile then just zonked out. I went home the next day and so concluded my awesome Monday at Jas’s house.   Wake up the next day, and I drop Bo off at his house and Kyle at his, and then I head home and it was about five and my comp shit came in. I was happy as hell but I didn’t even open it up because I was tired as a nigger being slave-driven all day long.  Next day I wake up and Jas’s comes over with Kate and pays me back for the long ass drive by helping me build my comp, only one problem, my video card hadn’t come in. Jas’s cut his finger hella bad and he went home and I went to sleep. And man I Freaking slept.  	Thursday, Friday, and half of Saturday went by in blazing fast speed because I had slept 30 of the next 48 hours. It was quite interesting. I had quite a high fever during whatever sickness I had contracted and I woke up during the middle of the night, delirious from the fever. I went to the bathroom (really hard to walk while delirious, it felt like I was in level 10 of the game called Drunk) and I saw my dog in the shower. The shower curtains were drawn back and the water was just gliding over him. He was staring at me, and I stared back for a couple minutes before the urge to urinate overcame my bewilderment and I proceeded with my business at the toilet. I guess I must of forget about the strangeness of having a dog sit in the shower because I just went back to bed and slept after it.   Well enough of this step by step recount of my time spent in the last few weeks. It’s taxing as hell on my sleepless mind and its hella long.   Hmm what has happened since then...   	Well, the whole thing between Lerin and I is over, whatever the hell it was between us. Basically the whole thing started out fine, but I could kinda see into the future as it ending as a total fuckup. After her boyfriend came back things pretty much got shot to shit anyway, and I’m glad it did, that shit wasn’t fun at all. We talked about it on the Saturday of my grounding and Lerin said something how she was still deciding between me and her boyfriend, I wanted to believe her at the time, but I really couldn’t. Next day we went driving around because she wanted to hang out or something, and that’s when I realized she had changed ever since her boyfriend got back.  More importantly I realized that whatever I had felt about her before, was no longer there, in fact it was hella gone. This was a relief to be honest, because I had been becoming attracted to Michelle and that would have led to some very fucked up shit I definitely didn’t want to go through. Didn’t talk to her for the rest of the week for going out n’ partying reasons but on the next Saturday (I think it was) we had a nice little conversation on aim. I was under influence of happy-inducing substances at the time and I laid the news down on her (I forgot to mention me and Michelle basically hooked up during the week at Jas’s house) and said we shouldn’t hang out anymore due to awkwardness etc. She didn’t seem too happy at the prospect and I guess I came across really mean. In fact, I was informed by the Great Corus that I was a complete asshole, and damn that made realize something. I have never in my life been labeled a true, serious asshole. Not even my actions have truly been labeled with asshole-like merit. So to Corus, I raise my can of coke I happen to be drinking right now in a toast of thanks, for finally someone labeling me as an asshole. It needs to happen more often.   	I’m glad that’s done with, It was not a fun thing to go through, buts it over, and more importantly in the past. Those who take it upon themselves to dwell in past transgressions shall never have a future, and I plan on having a future, so this is one past I shall soon forget about.   	Anyway, enough of that,  it’s been about two weeks and things between Michelle are going pretty good I like her more every time I see her. Yea, yea, same usual bullshit mush type stuff and you probably don’t want to read it so I shall end it now and move onto more things you most likely don’t care about.   Flashback to Monday after driving around with Lerin. Jas calls me up and wants to know if Michelle and I wanted to go to the movies with him and Kate. This sounded pretty fun so I said sure and called Michelle but she was eating dinner with her friend because it was her birthday (The friends, not Michelle’s) till 6. So to kill time Jas, Kate, and I went to Teaworks and poned some sorry n00bs in counterstrike. I was making some funny names like Jas Hates Kate and getting those two love birds all riled up its really amazing how attached to each other those two are. After that it ends up that we couldn’t decide on a movie to see so we decided on having a Soul Calibur tournament instead. This plan ended up screwy to so we just decided to have a party type thing at Jas’s with Jas, Kate, Me, Michelle, James, Faisal (Sp?), and another guy named Adam I think. Kyle and Kalley (SP? If I can't even fucking say her name what makes you think I can spell it? haha) came later on.   We watched movies and had a freaking blast. Best part of that week. Later in the night James and I went to my house and played battle toads on snes (It might have been a different night I can’t remember he spent the night a lot during that week.) I forgot how amazingly awesome battletoads was and how hard it was as well. First level you battle a huge nigger and you get to kick his ass in toad form. Why can’t they make more games like this? Video Game industry sucks rocks right now. Jap gaming has gone to hell, and the whole publisher-developer system sucks. All this does is force developers to become slaves to publishers and all publishers care about is making money so they would rather see a shitty game make them more of a profit then a good game that would cost more to produce but make a lot of people more happy. Yikes another rant has managed to seep into my blog, onto better things.   	Speaking of video games, I just got a new one fairly recently, for my new 1337 comp. It’s called Far Cry, you may have heard of it, maybe not. One thing I have to say about this game is that it’s got some pretty damn good graphics. It’s easily the best looking game I have played to date. The water looks fantastic, it’s got lush thick jungley shrub atmosphere, it’s got about a half a mile drawing distance, meaning that you can see about half a mile away in the game without stuff fading. Only have one problem with the game so far, and that’s the shitty voice acting. I really can’t believe people can sound so fake when trying to act. It doesn’t effect it that much but I haven’t got that far into the game because I am playing it on the second hardest difficulty setting (I usually always play on the hardest difficulty in video games, I like the challenge). The AI is pretty well done, I’ve been surrounded, ambushed, snuck up on, basically have had my ass handed to me on a silver platter many a time. It’s definitely whetting my appetite for Half-Life 2.   	Couple days after the battle-toad playing I go hang out with a guy that I have gotten to know better over the summer named Nick Norman. Back in math him and Kyle Martens were funny as shit. Another person I saw there was Chris Hobart, and this is one guy I haven’t seen in awhile. I never really knew him well either, but he used to come over a lot with a friend of his that was obsessed with my sister or something like that. Anyway, I got to know him better and he is a cool guy as well. Friend of Chris’s named Steve from his military school was there as well, and he seemed like a crazy mofo, but awesome none-the-less. He chained smoked and liked reds, and if you have these qualities you are OK in my book, Haha. Anyway so it was basically all of us guys and Michelle and we just hung out most the day and chilled it was really a strange day all of us were lazy and it was full of quiet moments that were kind of relaxing to me but may have been awkward to other people. Who knows?   	After chilling at some park we decided to go to Nick’s sisters’ house that lives about ten minutes away. So we drive down there and man it’s in this Mejicano MFing neighborhood. We were sitting in the backyard and it sounded like some Mexicans were having a wrestling match screaming Spanish profanities left and right. Comical it was, but it got kinda creepy after awhile. Nicks brother-in-law had this crazy ass room, decked out with posters of strange things, and cool little Seth McFarlane toy-type shit, like spawn and such. It also had in the midst of all this gothic looking crap, a picture of Jesus gazing upward with a crown of thorns cruelly shoved into his scull. This was the creepiest and strangest part of the room. It just ruined the whole evil look of the room and turned it into some kinda perversion. I don’t know how he ever slept in there.   	After that I went to see Chronicles of Riddick with Sean and due to the state I was in at the time I couldn’t tell what the hell was going on in the movie. That was easily one of the worst experiences of my life because I felt like crap the whole time and I threw up when I got home. Two days later made up for it though.   It’s Farm telling time. This was the best part of summer yet. We had this planned for a long time but it kinda jumped on me at the last second last Tuesday because truly I never expected it to happen. Basically James Ed, James, Michelle, and I went to James Ed’s farm and had a fucking hell of a good time. We played cards, listened to some really freaking good music (Even this terrible-vocaled band called Rhapsody sounded good at the time, they do have wicked solos, other kickassry music was The Black Dahlia Murder (5 stars), Led Zeppelin (4 Stars), Quo Vadis (5 Stars), Ensiferum (5 Starts), and Metallica Good Old Stuff(4 Stars). Also danced on a table, and worst of all, rapped the song Boys in the Hood by Easy E. Truly funny I bet if you were there to watch us. So much awesome stuff happened at the farm I don’t even think I could recount it all, just because it was one blast of awesomeness shoved into such a short period of time that if were to recount it all it would make your head explode from the mere act of reading it.    	z000m... back to the two days after Chronicles of Riddick (Man this is starting to become like a Quentin Tarantino directed blog). I met up with Nick and his friend Blake who seemed like a timid but cool guy and we went and chilled for awhile nice time. Then we had to drop Blake off and me and Nick went to Michelle’s and just hung around for an hour then watched Pulp Fiction.   Pulp Fiction is another movie that exceeds in the kickassry it is up on my top-ten movie list along with fight club. Now this movie truly kicks ass especially in the state I was in and having Michelle next to me with my arm around her, man at the time I would have claimed that God directed this movie, but after all, it is the great Quentin Tarantino, who is a god of directing.   	Unfortunately in the middle of the movie we had to go downstairs to eat and talk to her mom and I really am not a big fan of talking to adults, its definitely not my cup of tea so I never enjoy it but for a mom she seemed like a really cool one and maybe not too bad for being an adult. We shall see.   After eating we go and to pick up James  but he was being in his own words a “Jew Bean” and didn’t want us to come over because he was waiting for his pizza to be ordered (*Cough*Cough* This means he was masturbating *cough *cough*). So we drove around until his precious pizza arrived and he consumed it. Nothing to do at his house so we went back to Michelle’s and watched the rest of Pulp Fiction and just talked it was funny because we brought back old memories and applied to new things like Michelle’s sister. Let’s just say it involved dick-cheek slapping and ball-asshole tucking and farting back out. Hahaha, yes we are sick individuals but we wouldn’t have it any other way.   	Wow, we are almost at the present time. If you’re this far in reading this I salute you in the highest from of respect, a good ol’ high quality Nazi Salute (Fascist Salute is higher, but that’s what you give to ME not other way around).   	Before I start on the most recent events in the Manzy timeline I’d like to point out something that really shocked me. If you read my last entry I posted some short stories at writing.com and if you clicked the link you would of saw one called Emotional Novocaine or something like that. Well amazingly enough, this little bastard one me first place in one of their contests or something.   Click  Here  if you want to see it, its right at the top says first place with my name. I don’t know how you feel about it, you probably don’t care, but it’s pretty fucking cool to me especially how unexpected it was. Oh well, just felt like pointing that out now back to the events of the Manzy Universe.   	Alright, lets see, I pretty much covered everything… now onto today’s events. Today was pretty average I woke up supposed to go to work, but man I didn’t feel like going at all and luckily I have the most ultra kick ass job in the world, so they are ultra lenient they really don’t care if I’m there or not so I didn’t go. Basically all I do at this job is upload files about wells into their respective categories onto this virtual file room which is just a really well organized server so they can access info to wells more easily. Boring, yes, but the cool part is I have my own office, I’ve seen my boss maybe once or twice, and I have no one on my ass 24/7 like I’ve had at previous jobs. Yes my friends, this is the American dream. American dream at 10 bucks an hour makes it pretty freaking sweet. Coffee room too.   	Back to the Friday’s events, well my computer starting effing up so I just reinstalled windows and installed my motherboard drivers FIRST, which I should have done last time because it runs even more smoother and faster now then it did before, and I think even the processor runs at a cooler temp (Even though its still hot as shit). I worked on this pretty much all, got my internet back up, finally finished downloaded Microsoft Office so I could finally write this blog, and then reinstalled the awesome game Far Cry. Sean came over and had a pretty awesome CD with him and we listened to it on my awesome computer speakers then we picked up James and headed over to Kyle’s house. Guy I haven’t seen in awhile and seems pretty cool Steve Wilkins was there pretty well blown, so was Nick and Chris. We went to Starbucks where I saw Kyle order his custom Starbucks drink which had a million ingredients and took the ladies there forever to make. Worst part of this was we sat at the table and saw this heart on the table that read “Megan plus Kevin = Happy 4 Eva” or some stupid sappy horeshit like that. I’d lay money down that it was the Megan we all know and hate and our much pitied friend Kevin that were in the heart, and man that just brought bad horribly memories I didn’t want. Megan should really die. You know what she told my mom the other day? My mom was being her usually nosy, gossipy self, and was asking Megan about Michelle since I refuse to let them meet (If you know my mom you know that this is wise thinking, only bad things can happen if I let such a thing occur), and Megan, being the usual clueless, retarded, dumbass bitch that she is, tells her that Michelle is a fucking GOTH. I don’t know what crack pipe that dumb cunt has been smoking, but Michelle is far from a Goth. Geez, Megan, if your reading this, YOU look more like a Goth with your metallic grin and titanium smiles. I hope God kills you by sending lightning down straight to your metal mouth and causes your head to explode in gory wonder. Many a person would smile at the thought at that, hell many would dance with joy at the actual occurrence (Don’t deny it.).   	Argh, enough of the subject of Megan, she pisses me off just as much as Banana Phone (Chase I am going to kill you for making me relive that horrible freaking song again) and the name lil’ saint from the movie  you have been aided  (I refuse to write the name of that God Awful movie).   	Well I had a lot of more crap written but my comp got overheated and rebooted (stupid fucking thing) and I don’t think I can remember much of what I wrote. I’ll try I guess.   	Lately I have been listening to this one song that has been standing out of the others quite a bit lately. This song kicks much ass and is liked by metal lovers and non metal lovers. The name of the band is Ensiferum and the song is called Treacherous Gods. One word describes this song, not well enough but it does. Viking. Fucking Kick ass Viking. Pillaging, Raping, Killing, Battling, Chanting, all these runs through my mind while listening to this, and most of all is this: Vikings sitting around a huge banquet table, having a huge feast celebrating some glorious battle they had won, and all linked arm and arm, drunk of their Viking asses, singing their hearts out. Yes I think that when I’m listening to it. Nothing describes how good the feeling is driving around at 12 am, windows down, this song playing full blast with me and James singing our loudest to chorus while being buzzed. This stands up there with songs like Graveworm- Legions Unleashed, Quo Vadis- On the Shores of Ithaka.   	Well, the time has come to end my blog. It was a long journey, but now it is slowly going near its end. I am truly amazed at anyone that read this far, because I know I would never read something this long on the computer (Unless it was written by Stephen King, and sadly, I would read Stephen King’s shopping list, and even more sadly, I would probably like it).   	Writing this was taxing as hell, I never want to type again, ever. And to Zane, I beatchya biaatch. This thing is almost 4,800 words long. Mwahahaha. Man I’m fucking weird. I just looked through this and I wrote a hell of a lot of little things in parenthesis, I wonder if thats annoying.   	I don’t even know why I wrote this much, I guess it does feel kinda good putting all your thoughts into words, but I don’t think the payoff is nearly what I put into it. Two hours spent just typing away is a true pain in the ass, and one thing is for certain. I ain’t doing this for a long long time, which most likely means I’ll have another long ass entry in a month or two, but I shall be reenergized then. See you then, valiant reader, and I salute you again for reading this whole damned thing.     How many grams of slam could you cram while simultaneously taking hits of blam?

            Well, here's another terribly interesting post. If you’re expecting and ultra long entry that exceeds four thousand words then you will be disappointed. I'm not even going to begin to try to recount all the crap that has happened the last few weeks. Too much has happened is all I can say.         I'm at work right now with nothing to do, so I decided to put in a little blurb here to kill time.         Now onto why I have nothing to do. My boss (es) are gone somewhere and I've completed all my duties as assigned. Everyone I've tried contacting doesn't have a clue as to what I should do, so basically for the whole day I have been twiddling my thumbs gazing into nothingness. This may seem like the holiest of holy jobs but trust me, once you do absolutely nil for a few days, it gets kinda old, even if you’re getting paid ten bucks an hour.        Anyway, I went for a drive to vent my frustration and boredom out. I drove down I-45 and back, and came across some interesting fellows on the side of the feeder road. A trio of hardcore ghetto gangsta thugs were trotting a long, looking tyte and all. They were donned with gang paraphernalia: Bandanas, Du Rags (If spelled wrong, well I really don't care), chains, ice, watches, platinum gold grills, earrings, and whatever else I failed to take notice of. Two were black, obviously, but one was white boy yearning to be one of the "brothas." This irked me, I don't understand wiggers at all. I can understand a black guy wanting to be white, to further himself in society, but the logic in the idea of a white man trying to be black gangsta eludes me. Its like he wants to de-further himself.  So to show my unapproval I got into the left lane and blared the horn, stuck my hand out the window and flicked them off. I bet this looked really strange to the hoodlums because I was in office casual wear which consists of a dress shirt and pants. I was also wearing glasses, so I probably looked the roll of an office space droog quite well. They kinda stared at me blankly for a few seconds, this strange and unfamiliar event actually causing those rarely-used rusty wheels in their heads to start turning, and then they too raised their hands and returned the favor. All in all it was a cool experience.          Well, I'm done for now, see you next time valiant reader, and I challenge all of you today to go out and perform some deed similar to what I did. Be original though, do something along the lines of getting a pellet gun and shooting your local wiggas that rome the side of streets. Oh yah, by the way, don't die.
