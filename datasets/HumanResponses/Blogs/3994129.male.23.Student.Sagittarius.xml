      Posted on Common Dreams, and circulated throughout the web of late. I read this, and even as a non-american it rings true. If only people were to look outside of their bubbles and be open to other streams of thought. Ah, well, who am I kidding?      How I Will Stop The War   by Chris Andrews, written in March 2003   I wrote this last year before the war started, but somehow it seems more relevant now, people are more open to this type of thought. There's an awful lot of rhetoric and analysis out there, and I still think (like then) that people need to know what to do, themselves, at this moment. And something that reflects some different thinking, approaches. And unless "our side" proposes new ways to think and do, beyond countering the "evil right", I think the average person will stay in their comfort zone. Hope you agree, I wrote it to inspire people. I am convinced if people did this when I wrote this, we'd all be better off today. Not saying that from a place of ego, just from a place of truth, and what other people have told me.   I will limit the amount of war coverage I watch on TV to 10 minutes per day.  Because I know that watching something too closely makes you lose perspective.  Because the economic benefits of war will be lessened by watching TV less.  Because I have more important things to do, like read, think, reflect, discuss. And newspapers ain't bad!  Because I want to make a statement that I determine when and how I spend my time.   I will listen to every viewpoint, no matter how outrageous or destructive that viewpoint seems.  Because I need to understand outrageous and destructive viewpoints to make change.  Because then I can use new and innovative methods to defeat old destructive ways of thinking.  Because I can understand different people's motivations, so I help find new motivations to replace old ones.  Because our world has become too divided and segmented, and someone needs to think differently.   I will study new research and information on people, cultures, psychology, and groups.  So I can choose which viewpoint I want, and not just be the result of what I have been taught in the past.  So I can enlighten other people on ways to think and act, and these people may be "from the other side."  So I can have conversations at a very high level, with people who know that change is good and possible.  So I can truly understand the truth behind what is causing conflict in the world.   I will believe that anything is possible today.  Because war and total destruction are possible if I do not act and do something.  Because peace and prosperity are possible if I do something.  Because I know that it is always darkest before the dawn, and I want to see the dawn. Dawn is beautiful.  Because it is true, anything is possible. I will not forget this.   I will not let anyone stereotype me because of my thinking, nor will I stereotype anyone else.  Because I know I can be patriotic and still want to have peace.  Because using stereotypes is outdated, useless thinking.  Because I know that the opponent always tries to "put you in a box." Now the opponent can't do that.  Because then I will see things for what they are, and experience people for who they are.   I will make as many friends as I can outside the United States.  Because I know that this will be a good experience for them and for me.  Because the United States is ethnocentric, and I need to do something personally to break out of that.  Because I want to understand their viewpoints and cultures so we can really have a global village.  Because that is what life is all about isn't it? Growth, dialogue, passion, freedom. And more!   I will support the arts.  Because expression is very important to our culture at this moment in history.  Because America under appreciates and undervalues the arts.  Because the arts teach, provoke thought, gather people together, and they heal.  Because I know that there is more to life than making something faster, better, cheaper.   I will create peace around me. But I will also not be scared to have passionate discussions.  Because I know my friends and family will appreciate that.  Because I can't expect others to do what I can't do.  Because I know that rigorous discussion and exchange of ideas is something needed in our society.  Because I am my own venn diagram, and I want my venn diagram to be peaceful and passionate.   I will believe that there really is something called "the truth."  Because I know that today it is fashionable to hide the truth, and that causes problems.  Because then I can help other people understand how and why to seek truth.  Because I know that understanding and accepting the truth is at the root of resolving conflict.  Because the truth heals, if people have a context for understanding the truth. I know this.   I will understand the economics of war.  So I can understand better how I unknowingly contribute to the war.  So I can take a serious look at my own lifestyle, and see specifically where my consumerism is fueling this war.  So I can sit across the table from anyone, and debate this topic from an educated viewpoint.  So I can help to be part of the solution.   I will take a serious look at my own tactics for stopping the war, and question them.  Because I do not want to repeat old methods that never worked.  Because I think that the more creativity I have, the better I will help to solve problems.  Because my own contribution can be different than others.  Because I know that we have to find new strategies and methods for making real change.   I will understand history better by talking to older people, reading, and discussing historical topics.  Because I know deep down that this whole war needs to be looked at in a broader context.  Because I do not want to contribute to history repeating itself, the destructive side of history.  Because I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by understanding history.  Because I know that this war is rooted in previous wars and aftermaths, and I want to understand this.   I will spend more time with people of other cultures, near to where I live.  Because I know that "but I treat everyone equally" is no longer enough.  Because I know racism is institutional, and I do not want to contribute to it.  Because I want to form my own opinions about people, thank you very much.  Because it will be enriching in my own life to experience more people of different cultures.   I will spend at least 5 minutes per day in silence.  Because I know that this is important for people, while there is so much turmoil.  Because I know ideas will come to me about my own life.  Because I know that no one ever got hurt by spending 5 minutes in silence.  Because this will make me more focused and able to stop the war.   I will take a chance and send what I wrote here out to lots of people through the Internet.  Because I know that at least it will make people think.  Because I know that it is important to express thoughts.  Because I know that I wrote this in a manner that is supposed to cross "party lines."  Because I also want others to take a chance, and email this to their friends - as well as foes.   I will practice what I preach.  Not because of anything.  Itâ€™s just the right thing to do.

      Put on your thinking caps for a second.  Imagine you live in Sudan.  You've lived with the shadow of civil war for over 21 years.  In the last year, you along with over 1.2 million others have been driven from your home, displaced by the Government-Backed Janjawid militias.  You've witnessed homes looted and burned, towns bombed to the ground by the Sudanese Airforce, Girls systematically raped in front of their families, indiscriminant mass slaughters.  Before the last year, you lived on next to nothing; your country has one of the lowest GDP per capita.  Today you are living on even less.  Driven from one refugee camp to another, you are happy for any reprieve from the misery, no matter how fleeting.  Nevertheless you continue to come under attack despite the presence of international humanitarian aid.  You've lost some of your loved ones; the majority of your fellow villagers aren't so lucky.  There have been many apprehensions of people supposedly involved.  Prisoners suspeced of "sympathy" for the armed opposition to the gov't are held incommunicado, tried without due process, and tortured.  The Government not only turns a blind eye, but also is complicit in the hundreds killed and million plus displaced.  From ground level, it seems pretty hopeless.  Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?  What if it were your family?  Your loved ones?   For months, the international community sat by and did nothing about the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Darfur.  The amount of coverage in the mainstream media has, until recently, been absolutely criminal in its lack of exposure and dilligence in reporting.  Human Rights groups like Amnesty International(  urlLink   ) and Human Rights Watch (  urlLink   ) have been going it alone.  Now, the UN has finally mobilized, yet they have recieved less than half of the $349 million they have appealed for from in aid.  Hopefully these recent pleas will not fall on deaf ears, as countries such as Japan and France have the means to make a much larger contribution.  To its credit, the United States has earmarked a sizeable amount for foreign aid.  Yet, the world's lone superpower needs to take a much larger step in humanitarian leadership.  The UN has condemned the militias and their supporters, yet has stopped short of calling out the Sudanese government in their complicity.  It is hoped that the threat of sanctions will be enough to reign in the killing, yet much more needs to be done.  The Security Council has drafted a resolution proposing to suspend arms transfers to the militias.  Since, however, the militias are government-backed, it is all too clear that an arms embargo focused solely on the Janjawid will do little.  Amnesty International has called on the UN to suspend all arms trade with the Government; whether or not this happens is a matter of whether or not the US is willing to make the step of not only calling out those who have so far committed war crimes with impunity, but also to cut off the profits the arms trade would bring american firms.    The lack of true sanctions alone makes Colin Powell's words sound hollow.  Commendably, the US has taken a lead in the UN in the latest phase of the crisis.  The lack of urgency or meaningful sanctions, however, are glaring.  It is estimated that 15-20,000 troops would be needed on the ground to act as a peacekeeping force and secure the area.  The African Union has pledged to send 300 troops, clearly not enough. The utter silence from non-AU international bodies regarding this is glaring.  Powell has said that it would be "premature" to contemplate direct intervention.  Once again, we see utter hypocracy from the Bush administration, and further proof that the "humanitarian" reason to go to war in Iraq was a farce.  Here we see a deveoloping crisis with a clear consensus of condemnation from the international community.  More people have died in the last year in Sudan than in the year 2002 in Iraq, as a result of direct violence from blatantly complicit parties.  Where, then, is the aid?  Where is Bush's sabre rattling?  If nothing else, a cynic would say that this would be a windfall in the run-up to the election in November, a chance to prove that the US "really does care" about human rights WITHOUT alterior motives.  It is, however, not only the US at fault here, but the rest of the UN and EU as well.    It is clear that action is needed immediately.  Sadly, aid may come too late.  Look into Organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch if you care.  This is a situation that we all share a measure of responsibility for, and the time is now to mobilize.

      Thought of the Day:  It's interesting that people could give two shits about genocide, ethnic cleansing, nuclear proliferation, mass poverty, the international arms trade, incarcerated prisoners of conscience, the rise of globalized corporate mono-culture, depleted fossil fuels, humanitarian crises borne out of debt and sanctions, the commodification of natural resources, media consolidation, corporate fraud, rising sea levels, gun violence and murder rates, the decline of the UN, illiteracy, unemployment, militarization of space, the assault of civil liberties, their neighbour's dog getting run over, the Canucks choking in the playoffs, nothing to eat for dinner, Lucas writing and directing the prequels, Futurama getting cancelled, etc..........but if something comes between a person and their shopping experience, look out!!!  God knows that we need to defend our right to consume.   Hell hath no fury like a consumer deprived of the ability to spend money.

      Been feeling mildly sick the last few days, which has brought to the fore the old issue of how we percieve and deal with our own health.  Bombarded with, alternately, alarmist warnings about the latest health scare, and the newest medical breakthrough/wonderdrug du jour...even the least skeptic begins to feel as if they're on a seesaw that really has no substance whatsoever.  Now, the question of whether or not my feeling ill is psychosomatic aside, I was faced with the ever-present choice:  medicate or deal with things au natural.  Since I've only been feeling mildly sick I chose the latter, and am currently riding it out.  Whether or not it was a good choice for me is irrelevent to you, of course, but I think it underscores that we all should question not only the way we percieve our health/illness, but how we treat it.  Is pumping ourselves full of medication from Pfizer(tm) advisable?  Without going into a rant about conventional healthcare vs. holistic medicine I will just say that we need to reevaluate our conception of health.  I'm sure many of you have seen the video of the maltreatment of chickens at one of KFC's suppliers.  I'm not a huge fan of PETA, nor a militant vegan, but Its clear to me that not only is this (routine) mistreatment appauling to all but the most callous people, but that the arguments and rationalizations for it are flimsy and pathetic.  Whether or not you eat meat has absolutely no bearing on the morality of situations like this (which are all too common in factory farming systems).  The bottom line is that it comes down to whether or not you respect animals as equals to people.  Without that understanding, maltreatment of animals is essentially a fait a compli, since they're nothing more than food.  If you eat meat, the least you can do is make sure the animals are treated ethically before they end up on your plate, in your stool, and flushed down your toilet.  The least.  Media Consolidation.  Its the wave of the future!!  With Sony and BMG officially completing their merger (first announced in late 2003), they now control about 22% of the music industry.  Combined with Vivendi Universal, they have a stranglehold on over 50% of the music industry.  There are now a total of FOUR (count 'em, 4) Major Labels (EMI, Universal, Warner, and the new Sony/BMG monstrosity).  Yay for choice!!  What's a struggling indie artist to do?  Oh yes, and about 2000 employees of the two companies are going to lose their jobs.  A final note, go out and buy some fresh Corn, its in season now.

      Wake Up.&nbsp; Shower.&nbsp; Shave.&nbsp; Brush Teeth.&nbsp; Eat Breakfast.&nbsp; Register For School.&nbsp; Pay Bills.&nbsp; Go To Bank.&nbsp; Work.&nbsp; Take Car To Shop.&nbsp; Network.&nbsp; Eat.&nbsp; Sleep.&nbsp; Lather, rinse, and repeat.  &nbsp; Routines are interesting, aren't they?&nbsp; When you are so entrenched in something, eventually it becomes a part of you; To the extent that not only is this aspect of drudgery completely integrated into your life, but you can't even imagine your life without it.&nbsp; I will now pull out the over-used analogy of us being robots, automotons going through the motions of life, blind to the beauty that's around us every second.  And yet, we in fortress North America have absolutely NOTHING to whine about.&nbsp; Nice and happy&nbsp;with our houses on the hill, SUVs, 2 car garages, 100's of channels of shit on Cable TV, designer clothes, and fat bank accounts, we forget that despite the conveyor belt we are on, we have one important thing that many people do not have:&nbsp; An ability to break out.&nbsp; We're not starving.&nbsp; We don't have to worry about being shot when we go down to the grocery store.&nbsp; We're not being bombed daily, as part of a "pacification" process to&nbsp;"liberate" us.&nbsp;   Lamenting the state of&nbsp;our post modern life&nbsp;is good.&nbsp; That's the easy part.&nbsp; The next step is harder:&nbsp; We have to do something about it.&nbsp; We have an ability to do something, to enact change, to open other's eyes.&nbsp; Some people call this Resource Mobilization.&nbsp; Well, we can.&nbsp; Moreso than about 95% of the rest of the world.&nbsp; To abdicate this responsibility, to simply throw up your hands and give up, is just as bad as giving in.&nbsp; Far too often, we look at the suffering in Darfur, in Haiti, in the Phillipines,&nbsp;on the East Side, and simply say "That's horrible.&nbsp; Oh Well, what can I do?",&nbsp; promptly returning to our blissful ignorance.&nbsp; If we, who have more ability to actually do something about the injustices of the world, simply retreat into cynicism and resignation, we are just as complicit as those heads of state, those Multinationals, those Trade Organizatons who systematically enforce the paradigm that brings such suffering.  I'm sick and tired of lack of compassion masquerading as "realism" and "cynicism".&nbsp; It takes infinitely more courage to remain idealistic in the face of such uncaring people.&nbsp; The thing is, being idealistic when you have such an ability to enact change actually WORKS.  It falls upon us.  But what do I know?&nbsp; Oh well, whatever, nevermind.

      A new beginning?&nbsp; Every moment, every second...constant flux.&nbsp; Here's to the start of a new blog, that I will undoubtedly look back on and laugh at.&nbsp;   Strange things, these online diaries:&nbsp; Stunningly pointless, yet somewhow an intriguing look at people's ideas and lives.&nbsp; I alternately scoff at and am enthralled by people's blogs; everything from the most mundane, assinine musings, to pseudo-profound thoughts on the nature of the universe.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; Maybe the meaning of them is in their open-endedness...Always changing, old thoughts forever receding into the past, new ones spilling out of the head and onto that lovely&nbsp;information superhighway by the second.&nbsp; I really don't know, but I figured I would give this blog a shot, regardless of how the content will look in the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  So, this is the beginning.&nbsp; I have no clue how often I'll post, or what shape this blog will take in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how things will end up.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;a&nbsp;format such as this teaches us, if nothing else, that the cliched saying holds true:&nbsp; The journey is more important than the destination.  I need to get something to drink.

      I was lucky enough to get out to the  urlLink Matthew Good  show at the Commodore on thursday. It was the first of back-to-back nights he played; I would very much have liked to have made it to the Friday night show, which was apparently very good (Avalanche! I wish that was on the setlist for Thursday!); Alas, work came in the way of being able to do the "double header".  Nevertheless, the concert was great. Aside from a few idiots throwing shit at the stage the crowd was actually very mellow and well behaved. The band was very tight and on point, my only complaint being that Christian's lead guitar was too low in the mix. As that this was the first time I have seen him live since the MGB/Audio of Being era (regrettably I missed the last tour), this is the first time I have been able to watch the "new/post MGB" lineup. I certainly wasn't disappointed. The set was mostly comprised of songs off of White Light Rock & Roll Revue, but the band also threw in some older material. I was hoping for "Suburbia" or "Prime Time Deliverance", but hey, you can't win 'em all.  A side note: one issue that irks me is the flak that Matt Good, or any other artist (irrespective of medium) who chooses to be outspoken in their political views, takes from both ignorant fans and the media. The "just shut up and play" mentality that the public applies to (ironically) public figures is beyond ridiculous. We like our entertainment, but not our art, it would seem. Mindless, vapid entertainment is fine and dandy, but God forbid any substance pertinent to the world at large comes into play.  Not only does the passivity that saturates many of our lifestyles affect us, but it colours the way we view others who *my God* actually try to be proactive and engaged in things. Amazing.  Anyways, Matt is very involved with  urlLink Amnesty International , and should be commended for using his status to help raise awareness about important Human Rights and political issues. I find it funny that his reputation as a sardonic, cynical bastard may precede him, but if one actually listens without preconceived notions, he is quite positive of late. His  urlLink blog  is highly recommended reading.    Since I haven't done one yet, here we go -   NOW PLAYING:    On the stereo:    The Smiths - Hateful of Hollow Matthew Good - White Light Rock &amp; Roll Revue The Beta Band - Heroes To Zeros Sparta - porcelain Wilco - A Ghost Is Born Modest Mouse - This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing To Think About   Reading Material:   Chalmers Johnson - Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire Eqbal Ahmad - Terrorism: Theirs and Ours David Brock - The Republican Noise Machine   On the web:     urlLink The Political Compass - "right" vs. "left" is outmoded and inadequate.   urlLink Zmag.  Needs no real introduction.   urlLink Erowid - educate yourself about those illicit substances known as "drugs" before condemning    On the TV/Movie Screen:   The Village The Manchurian Candidate Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle(!!!)

      Do you think Nickelback are the pinnacle of artistic achievement??  Are you anxiously awaiting the the next "Fiddy" album??  Do you find Pink to be "edgy" and empowering to women??  Did you find the new Justin Timberlake Album "raw"??  Is MTV or the radio your main source of new music??  Does an artist need high-rotation airplay for validation of artistic merit in your eyes??  Do you love "I want to hold your hand" but hate the fact the Beatles had to go and get all "weird" on everybody??  Is Entertainment Weekly a credible source of cultural dissemination and commentary??  Can't wait for the next installment of American Idol??      Do you miss the Spice Girls??    If you answered yes to any of the above questions then, unfortunately, you have bad taste in music. Statistics show that the majority of your mass-media consuming peers also suffer from the same ailment; you are not alone. But don't despair, for there is hope for all victims of this tragic phenomenon in today's popular culture.   urlLink Yes friends, there is salvation for all you media-saturated automatons that pray at the alter of MTV . One needs only to follow  Three  simple steps to cure oneself:  1) Do Not Attend Concerts which showcase bad music  2) Stop Listening to bad music  And most importantly, 3) Turn off your radio and television!!   Friends, this is an epidemic of colossal proportions in today's society. However, we need not stand by idly while millions more fall into the trap of mass media inspired consumer comas. I write this not out of self interest, but out of compassion for my fellow man (and woman). We must take action now!!    Thank you.   urlLink http://www.youhavebadtasteinmusic.com    A Public Service Announcement brought to you by PABT (People Against Bad Taste), an open-membership activist group that seeks to educate the public on matters of poor taste in consumption of mass media culture
