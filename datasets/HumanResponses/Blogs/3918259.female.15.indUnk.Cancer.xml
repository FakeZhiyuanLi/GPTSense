           I hate it when: My mother comes into my room without knocking or anything My brothers come into my room without knocking My family leaves all of their dirty dishes around the house for me to pick up and put in the dishwasher. Come on guys, putting dirty dishes into the dishwasher is not rocket science! I am told to do something and nobody ever informs me, then I get yelled at Anywho, enough of my malicious ranting... Since I last posted, my birthday and my mother's have passed. I am now 15, w00t. I took a very nice self portrait. I discovered that sitting next to the fan after taking a shower creates a very cool whispy effect with my hair. Take that picture in black and white, then transfer it to the computer and edit it a whole bunch, and I look halfway pretty. And I say halfway because it's only half of my face. But I like it a whole lot.

       I don't get it,  I really don't .    Ermm... a&nbsp; boy meets a girl. They're both interested in each other. He calls her a couple of times. Then he doesn't call for 2 weeks. They talk on the internet, he's now interested in some girl named Courtney Fewkes. I hate getting my dreams and hopes smashed like this. It makes you ponder the meaning of it all... I don't think Justin's saying that he wants a relationship bad is valid anymore. If he wanted it enough, he'd have to stick to the same girl for a matter of time. Not jump from girl to girl in a matter of weeks... Ah hell, what do I know? I'm just a disappointed teenage girl, nothing new to world about that. They're all over the bloody place. Okay so I've been talking to Matt, about things I'd want in a guy:      is not a jackass    is not an idiot    is not an asshole    is not like Taze Henderson    speaks his mind    someone I can converse with well     I'll tell you what, the only guys like that I know live over 250 miles away. And they're all good friends of mine, I couldn't imagine dating any of 'em. Hah,  patience is the essence.  I'm running out of patience. Especially with Justin Ogborn. OH, I did the greatest thing last night at almost 2 AM: I threw a rock at Taze Henderson's window and cracked it. Hopefully I don't have to pay to replace it. I really  hate  him... he's such a jackass. I have no idea what the hell I saw in him... that guy is the most immature, annoying, and stupid guy I know of.     I'll probably read this later, laugh, and tell myself  this is what happens when you only get 5 hours of sleep. You say weird things in public places, and not have a bloody care in the world.  Today I'm gonna go up to Lost Lake with Kailyn, yippee, more time to think about my life and its values.    Which reminds me, Justin and I were talking last night about our place in the "relationship world." Currently we're both at the observing and taking notes from the sidelines stage (which is probably where I'm going to be stuck at for some time, I dunno 'bout Justin, he's a nice guy and he can get a girl.). You'd think from observing other people's mistakes, you'd learn not to do it. But you know what? You make the same mistakes. Maybe its something you can't observe, you have to learn it for yourself... Ah, well, I gotta go, love y'all.
