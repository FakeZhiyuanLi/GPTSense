      OMG!! I talked to Richard today!! I am sooo happy! He is the nicest guy that I have ever met and he used to be my best friend I loved him so much...I still do and ahhh it was so nice. but then he asked me out and I said no...I don't know why I said no because I hella liked him. and then I went out with some other guy like the next day and then I cheated on the guy with Richard's bestfriend and so sophomore year he (Richard) was just a dick to me all year and it was really not cool and I missed him so much because he was so cool...anywho so I am on the bus on the way home today and some random person trips me over while I am walking down the isle and it is...::drum roll:: RICHARD!!! We talked the whole ride home and then I walked him half way to work!! Oh my gosha I am so happy! I love Richard so much....don't tell anyone but I still have a crush on him...I have had a crush on him the whole time I was going out with Dan (the guy I went out with after richard asked me) and then after dan (But i forgot it when I was with cassidy because I really had big whopping huge feelings for cassidy) and then when cassidy dumped me*BAM!* the feelings for richard came back and I was like NOOOOOOO I can't like richard!! He doesnt like me!!! ARGGHHH!!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!! But even though I screamed and screamed at my self nothing worked...so here I am writing about my crush on Richard that I still have....oh yeah and when Richard asked me out I was kinda prude but now I am not and i am totally confident in myself and I wasnt when he asked me out...why the fuck am I writing this??  Anywho cassidy should be coming to my house tomorrow to pick up a movie and a CD yay for me!! lol I'm just kidding...anywho I was totally surprised when cassidy called me...lol for some stupid reason when I heard a guys voice on the other line I was like *"Please be Richard"* in my head and then it was cassidy...the funny thing is I was disappointed that it wasn't Richard!!! LOL!! even though the person was cassidy...ok typing random shit that no one is going to want to read so I am going to go now

      I had the weirdest dream last night. It involved Spencer, Megan, Dan Collins, Me and then a couple of other unknown peoples. We were driving up the hill and we looked into the back yards below us and they all had pools. ALL of them!! some had three pools some had hottubs aswell somehad pools above other pools with a waterfall joining the two...it was insane. Then we got to this cave and this old lady was all "You need to leave! this is my house! You're trespassing!" and then she showed us this really like legal looking documantry thingy saying that it was her property. Then we got two choices to leave. Down hill with lots of rocks looking dangerous but not on her property, or up hill nice and smooth with dirt but on her property. we went up the hill and then me and this girl were talking about bikinis because she has a pink and black polka dotted one and I said that I had on the same but the dots were black blah blah blah...then we got to the top and the hill curved downwards and so did the ceiling of the cave! and some how we managed to BUNGEE JUMP down the fuckign thing. I dunno what is goign on in my subconcious but god it is different

      Love is a perky little elf doing a spazzy little jig who then suddenly turns on you with a little miniature machine gun!!! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! lol ok that was random...but even though it sounds random read it again and you will realize that there is a hidden meaning. ohhhhh deep! :)   The only people who can hurt you are the ones you love, because if you didn't love them then you wouldn't care.

      Tearless grief bleeds inwardly. ~Christian Nevell Bovee  This is true. People don't be afraid to cry..or show emotions because it just hurts you more and then when you grow up you will become emotionally unstable which means you will probably turn into a serial killer of sometime and run around stabbing people who resemble the person/thing that gave you the grief and we can't have that happening now...can we???

      I wrote this while I was dating this guy Cassidy. He was my first time and I really did love him. But now he's gone. Here it is.  When you move When you breathe When you slowly Slip into me  We travel into another world Our hearts beating fast We then become as one As we let time pass  Yeah I wrote that after a night on the lake August 15th 2003

      Wow I just ate half a bag of Old Fashioned Restaurant Style Tortilla Chips. Let me tell you about these here Tortilla Chips. They are from Mi Rancho...which in spanish means My ranch but they did not come from MY ranch they came from someone else so they should not be called Mi Rancho...ok moving on there are no Preservatives...good thing? I would hope so! The Tortilla chips contain Stoneground corn flour, Soybean Oil, Salt, Trace of Lime. What is Trace of lime? Does it mean there are traces of lime in it or is it a brand name of something?? because if it is a brand name they should tell you what is in this so-called "Trave of Lime"....oh yeah and Mi Rancho is on 425 Hester Street, San Leandro CA 94577. That sounds like it is really far way from where I live. I live in California...they Bay Area...with the Governator as our ruler!! Dun dun duuuunnn...kk..it is now 12:18 so I am goign to bed because I have school tomorrow...GAY!!  Toodlez

Yay for the easily amused!! High Five (long distance AT&T style!!) That is a really old joke between me and Sam Agens (Audra Smith's {me old bestfriend in year nine)ex-boyfriend who was 19 and she was 15!! big difference)...ok yeah I don't know what to write so I am going to go fill in my profiley and stuffs.
