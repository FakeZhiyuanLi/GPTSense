      Todae dunno why...in a bad mood..sad........ I felt so left out in almost everything...a friend of mine made me upset..sob..then i felt so down..... almost all of my frends are in 3E2..so maybe thats why i felt so left out.. and...DAMN..i ate too much sweets during lesson time todae..but i never got caught..haha..but i gave some of my frends..and the moment i gave them the sweet and they started chewing it...haha..guess wat happen..haha..the teachers caught them..unlucky chaps..heZ.. I gAVEmyself a DAMN promise..i will reduce the amount of sweets from todae onwards...1st reason..--> to prevent from being fat..2nd reason--> to prevent toothache...bla bla bla...  nowadays so many homework...feel like killing the teachers!!!  haha..yesterdae got caught imitating a teacher and the teacher who caught me imitating ask me not to make fun of other ppl's physical weakness..sob..haha..
