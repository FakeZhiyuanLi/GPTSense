      You know what? I think, I will continue this blog. But I've a problem. I've another blog in French and I can't add it in my blog list on my profile... Why? I don't know, maybe a bug in the system? I've put Yes to the question about it in the setting.  I'm trying to have news of my good friends. After three months in vacation at home, I begin to understand if I do nothing I will lost all my friends! And I don't want to become alone! It's not very interresting! And I need friends. Friendship is very important to me.  Have a nice day.

      Hi, I think to close this blog. I have another one where I'm writing on in French. Some people have been reading it since I opened it. I don't think writing to nobody in English will help me to improve it. Maybe. I don't know if I must to close it or not! I like writing about everything. I don't like studying English in English book, because I can't memorise all what I read. But, I learn a couple of new words and I'm very happy because I understand what I read. I am a little tired today, because I went to bed at one thirty yesterday. I got up at ten thirty. I begin to have some good friends, I'm very happy. I need it. Thanks.

      This time, I'm going to write about my interests.  At the end of my cegep, I began to be interest about computer. After I have made my first web site, I decided to do a degree in computer science. I have been making  urlLink web site  for five years. I like it, because I can write about everything. I can find people who have the same interests of me. I know that what I do, some people look at it.  The music is very important in my life. I like to listen to music. I'm very emotional and the music helps me. I want to play music, but I don't have the motivation. I have too many things that I want to learn.  I like Japanese animated cartoons. I have listened many times the 76 episodes of Marmalade Boy and the 48 of Kimagure Orange Road. I have seen Porco Rosso, Princesse Mononoke and Perfect Blue. I like animated cartoons from  urlLink Pixar . I have  urlLink Finding Nemo  at home and the short animation with the  urlLink snowman  is funny.  Since summer 2002, I have been reading  urlLink Harry Potter  books. Soon, I'm going to finished the last one. Ye! I could read another story.  I like to walk and paint, because those activities help me to relax.

      Today, I'm writing about relationship. I have a lot of difficulties to have a good relationship, but I have a lot of friends that I want to keep. I am not going to talk about someone in particular. I met some of my friends at school, we were in the same class. Others, I met them on Internet : visitors of my web site. Some of them are living in Europe. I like to chat with my friends. Sometimes I meet them. Just sometimes because they work and have a lot of friends too. So... me, I'm not very interesting. But it's ok. I have my activities too, alone : walking, painting, reading, making web site... but I like having coffee and talking to someone face to face. But... everybody is lazy and doesn't want to move.

      Hi! Today, I'm going to introduce myself.   My name is Anne. The important things in my life are friends, music and computer. I'm a  urlLink bachelor in computer science . I received my diploma in June 2004. By now, I want to become very good in English. I like Japanese animated cartoons. I saw Porco Rosso at  urlLink Fantasia festival  yesterday. My favourite Japanese animated cartoons is  urlLink Marmalade Boy . I'm making a web site about it. My favourite sport is tennis, but I don't practise, because I don't have a  partner. I'm not very good and not very strong, so it's difficult to find someone. I think to take tennis course. I hope become very good in English, find an interesting job and go to Europe for two weeks or more.   It's enough for today.  Thanks.
