       It's been a few days. I went to the coast with my husband's family. We had a decent time. Now it's back to the old grind.  I just read my horoscope. It says:            For August 17: Mars and Mercury heighten your desire for change and variety, particularly in your residence. What worked in the past may no longer reflect your ephemeral needs and desires. Excess energy, excitement or tension makes healthy physical exercise a necessity today. Without some form of exercise, your mind may never calm down. On another front, you’re ready to invest in your future – and your future may involve property. You’re also eager to break tradition and defy the odds. Is it any wonder that others find you so exciting?     urlLink             My mother is very into astrology, and I've found that many times it's right on target - your sign, your numbers, it really does define who you are.  Anyways, I feel like I am in need of a change, but to what? My mind is racing. It's very busy, but busy with stuff that I can't even decide is important.  Oh, well, enough of the self-involvement. I don't have enough patience to look inside myself and try to figure out what's going on.  I have different topics I want to cover. I skip back and forth between interesting ideas, tagging them with a "blog that one later" flag. However, when I get to the blog, I forget the ideas...isn't that the way it always is?  My next few posts will cover such topics as:     ..An amateur's thoughts on astrology   ..Conservaliberals ..Why men and women are equals   ..There is a God

       It's the end of the day for me at work. Although the homelife part of the day will just be starting, and my mind is already befuddled.      I think it has to do with the fact I'm a little confused as to my job situation. I'm not sure exactly where I stand. I made the decision to go part-time, even though I have kept the main duty of redesigning the user-interface for the software system our company sells.      Anyways, it's as if magically by going part-time all my smarts and insight are no longer valid. I am no longer an individual to which people come for input and ideas. I'm not "management" anymore. I don't know why I let it bother me, but I do.      I have put in 8 years with this company, mostly in a management, or at least leadership, position. My input being very valued during pretty much the entire time. Except now. We did a reorg, and I now have a manager over me. Someone who really wants the job, but is about 10 years younger than me, and who has only worked here a little over a year.      No problem with that, really. I did after all make the decision to not come back full-time, otherwise I would have my current manager's job. However, it still rankles. I"m all of a sudden a non-entity. Is it because I'm part-time, and therefore cannot participate in a fashion where I can provide good feedback, or is it because I'm not a manager, and therefore not 'important' enough to have a valid opinion anymore?      It bugs me either way. Don't know what to do about it, since I don't want to go back full-time...although I pay full-time daycare so I can be available to come in on the days I don't work, when necessary. I also work at home on days I have off, so I can't say that on average I'm incommunicado during my days off....I work 27-30 hours on average. My days off, besides Saturday and Sunday, are Wednesday and Friday.      I don't know what my point is. I haven't told anyone about this because I'm not sure it's an issue, but somehow, in my gut, I feel it is. Oh, well, at least I got it down on e-paper.      Thanks for listening,   shawn

       Well, I just made my "first time blogger" mistake. I entered my first message and promptly, accidentally deleted it.      Anyways, my point with the original post, which I cannot really duplicate, was the fact that I have been writing in journals for years. I have actually had one particular journal going on two years now that I haven't finished. I should write more often, because I notice that once I empty some of my thoughts onto paper, my head feels less fuzzy, and I have more clarity and room for new ideas.      I think the main reason I don't write more often is because my hands are just lazy. It's hard holding a pen and moving my hand around a page. It seems easier just to type, although the act of typing can get pretty tiring as well.      We will see how this goes. I am looking forward to blogging, been thinking about it for awhile, and now I've finally taken the plunge. Hope my next entry is not only soon, but topical.      shawn
