        Must Have Chocolate   This lady goes to a restaurant and orders a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a scoop of strawberry ice cream and a scoop of chocolate icecream and the waiter says, "Mam, we have no chocolate." So the lady says that's okay she will have a vanilla milk shake, a strawberry milk shake and a chocolate milk shake.   Once again the waiter tells her "Mam, we have no chocolate!" And once again the lady changes her order and says she will have vanilla cake, strawberry cake, and chocolate cake.   This time the waiter is mad and shouts "Mam, we have no chocolate. Let me try to explain this to you. Do you see the word van in the word vanilla?"   The lady replies, "Yes."   The waiter then asks her if she sees the word straw in the word strawberry and she once again replies yes.   Then he asks her if she sees the word fuck in the word chocolate and the lady says "There's no fuck in chocolate."   And the waiter exclaims, "Exactly! THERE'S NO FUCKIN CHOCOLATE!"

        My Mood today well is  quite O.K. abit bored tho.    Anyhow, i didnt get enough sleep today hehe cos i slept like 5.30 a.m. cOS The whole night i was chatting with My  "Close Frend", Emily  to occupied my time besides i was so bored dat nite so wat the heck. Hehehehe And I woke up like twice this mrning, cos there someone calling at home which really bugs me cos the phone was at the side at the bed and u wats worst, the person called had the wrong number, my god!! It really ruined my dream. I know u must be wondering wat i was dreaming; well i was dreaming about my gurlfrend really. Kissing here and kissing there~~ U know wat i mean. Really miss her tho. As i woke up, my target was switched on my pc and my modem. Then after my pc was on, my frend emily greeted me in My yahoo messenger.. So i end up chatting with her again.hehe She really amused me with telling story and stuff and sometimes we compare our life in our own country which really fun + she really knows how to entertain me. So i ate and sat infront of the pc for hours chatting with her without bothering to go out from my room. Hehehe   Then in the afternoon , nothing much happen. Just continue study fo my ASEAN test which is coming soon. Planning to full speed my study over taking 2 topics in one day. Unfortunately, my laziness conquered me and i end up lasting only 30 minutes reading half a topic. hehehe Later in the afternoon i then do some execrise to clear my mind and also i was feeling a bit sick with my usually common flu. After that, i felt much better. Then the guy last nite that pissed me off, apologised to me just now for being overreacting.So I was planning later tonite,i'll forgive him.. hehe I really dont want to end up having an enemy for life. hehe Tats me..   At night, my family decided not to eat dinner home and ate dinner at my closest cuzzies place in the whole wide world hehe.. Its really been a long time didnt eat together with my cuzy at the home. Kinda miss that cuzon and cuzon sPecial moment.. Wat m i saying..??? hahaha oh.. when we got back from my cuzzies place, i missed the !st fifteen minute of wwe raw. :/   My views on WWE RAW:                                                 Wat i managed to watch wen i arrived at home was HBK being tortured by that damn Kane. Wat the hell that he wants with HBK? Its really a horrifying moment to HBK Injured. I just really dont want to describe it anyway.                 The 1st Match was: A  TAG TEAM MATCH. Trish(c) & Tyson Tomko Vs, Matt Hardy & Lita.  And Lita and Matt Hardy defeat Trish Stratus and Tyson Tomko. Yay! hehe Really proud of Lita! She pinned that Slut Trish. Hahaha                The 2nd match was : A  TAG TEAM FLAG MATCH. La Resistance'(c) Vs. The Hurricane And Rosey.  La Resistance(c) def. The Hurricane and Rosey by cheating. I dont know but u guys, but i really support La Resistance'. I shud they are the one of the dirtiest tag team in wwe. hahaha *salutes* Go La Resistance'!!         Wat really questioned me is Lita. She is  Pregnant?!  Wat The hell?? I wonder who she have sex with. I hope is not Kane cos she might end up with A Baby Zombie. Hahaha  The 3rd Match was A Tag TEAM MATCH AGain!!!. Stacy Kiebler and Nidia Vs. Gail Kim and Molly Holly . Gail Kim and Molly Holly def. Nidia and Stacy Keibler by Submission. No comment on that cos Gail Kim, Stacy Kiebler and Nidia are my favourites hehe..           The Main Event Was.  An Elimination Tag Team Match. Chris Jericho , Benoit (c) And Edge Vs. Randy Orton (c), Batista And Ric Flair . Awesome Match.. It took more than 30 minues in this match. 1st to Be eliminate was Batista by both 3 finishers of the 3 opponents and was pinned by Jericho. 2nd to be eliminate was Chris Jericho by An RKO (randy Orton)pinned by Ric Flair wen the referee didnt see it. 3rd was Edge by an RKO and pinned by Randy Orton. 4rd to be eliminate was  Ric Flair by a Cripple Crossface by Benoit and Lastly was Randy Orton by a Sharp Shooter by Benoit.  I shud say this week raw is about Tag Team match majority. hehehe  Ok Till Next Time,  Hazim xoxox

        Do I look Fat?  How to Answer  It is Saturday, a crisp spring afternoon, and you're exactly where you should be: stretched out on the couch in front of a televised sporting event. Opening beer number two, relaxed in the knowledge that the pizza you ordered is even now on its way. Nothing could improve this moment, except maybe a bigger television. Suddenly your girlfriend enters the room and says,  'DO I LOOK FAT?'  There is no answer to this question that won't be interpreted 'yes'.  'No' means yes. 'Yes' means yes. 'I don't know' means yes. 'It doesn't matter' means yes. The briefest hint of a pause before speaking means yes, yes, yes.  Most of us would rather take our degrees again than field this one, yet it may well come up several times a week. Your only real choice is to say no, clearly and immediately, leaving no possibility for any subtext, and making it sound like a widely acknowledged fact and not simply your opinion. This doesn't work, but all the other options are worse.  There are several other questions for which 'No' is the only answer, and several more that call for an emphatic and unqualified yes. In all of these cases, elaboration, justification or any attempt to be funny is unlikely to pay off.  Consult this handy chart:  JUST SAY NO:  Is there someone else? Do you still fantasize about her? Are you tired of me?  JUST SAY YES:  Do you still love me? Do you ever fantasize about me? Do you like my hair this way?  Unfortunately, many female inquiries require more than a simple yes or no response. Some of them are more like riddles. Such as this one:  'WHICH SHOES LOOK BETTER?'  This raises the question of why she's asking you at all. She knows you don't know which shoes look better, and she knows you don't care, so why is she trying to elicit your opinion? This is part of an ongoing campaign to domesticate you. Suggest that she try on the other shoes, then tell her the first ones look better. This lets you more or less off the hook, as long as you don't raise a fuss when she decides that the second pair are better after all.  On no account suggest another dress. You might as well say 'You're fat.'  'WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS RELATIONSHIP IS GOING?'  This could be described as an essay question, since you're obviously not going to get away with snappy little answers such as 'forward' or 'upstairs' or 'I dunno'. She wants a heartfelt expression of your feelings and an honest assessment of your future together, and you want an easier question.  There is certainly no point in answering a toe-curling query like this one without at least a rough idea of precisely what it is she wants to hear. Questions such as this one are a category unto themselves, i.e. questions that should be answered with another question. See how easily some of the more difficult leading inquiries can be parried through the simple deployment of reflexive interrogation.  HER: Where do you see this relationship going? YOU: Where do you see this relationship going?  HER: Do you think she's attractive? YOU: Who?  HER: Will you marry me? YOU: Where am I?  HER: What if I were pregnant? YOU: Are you pregnant? HER: Why? Do I look fat?  We're in a bit of trouble here. You should have seen that coming. Try a more surreal approach:  HER: What if I were pregnant? YOU: What if I were pregnant?  At the very least it gives you time to think up a better answer.  Some all-purpose question-answers include:  How much is a lot? Why do you ask? Should I be? What are you saying? Does it matter? What's love got ta do with it? Are you talking to me? (NOTE: Are you having your period? is not advisable.)  Let's try a math question.  'HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?'  Hmmmmm....Now, you can tell her the truth, unless the truth is more than 12, or you can have a guess at the number she's more or less expecting.  Here's a safe rule: If the result is greater than 12, then say 12. Let's move on.  'ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT TO END IT?'  Women, like lawyers, rarely ask a direct question, unless they already know what the answer will be. As for women lawyers, I don't know what they do, and I'm pretty sure I don't want to know. The point is, when a woman asks you this question, she knows you're going to say no. Even if you want to say yes, you'll say no. You can't turn the question back on her, because you have no idea what her answer is going to be. If you are trying to break up with her, you'll have to say no and start the whole painful process again. If you aren't trying to break up with her, then it's best to change the subject. Let's try something easier.  'NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT ME?'  Well, slightly easier. Apart from being a question that is easier to answer wrong than right, it is best treated in an ironic post-modern context. Try an attempt at humor:  HER: Notice anything different about me? YOU: New apron?  HER: Have you forgotten what today is? YOU: Of course not. It's Thursday.  HER: Have you been listening to a word I've said? YOU: That's nice dear...  Funny, huh? Well, it's not your fault if she doesn't get it. If she wants a better answer, she's going to have to start asking better questions. Questions such as:  'HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOOK AT YOURSELF LATELY?'  This question and its cousin, the almost always uncalled for 'Who do you think you are?', are ways of gently reminding you how much of a factor charity was in her original decision to go out with you, and how that decision could be rescinded if you behave in any way that cannot be described as abject. You probably brought this rebuke on yourself by mentioning that you reckon Brad Pitt is getting a little chubby or by speculating that Jack Nicholson doesn't have to wait until his birthday for oral sex.  You're not really supposed to answer either of these questions. You're just supposed to apologize for your wanton self-esteem. Instead of apologizing, just smile. Your manifold inadequacies as a boyfriend - nay, as a man - are a kind of revenge all by themselves. Next.  'DO YOU BELIEVE IN FIDELITY?'  Like most philosophical questions that seem to pop up out of the blue, this question doesn't pop up out of the blue. This general query about fidelity is in fact a coded inquiry about the extent of your fidelity on a specific occasion or occasions. Your response will also have to be coded. Consult this translation chart before giving your answer:  YOU SAY - Yes YOU MEAN - How much does she know? SHE THINKS - He's hiding something  YOU SAY - It depends YOU MEAN - How much does she know? SHE THINKS - I knew it!  YOU SAY - Why do you ask YOU MEAN - How much does she know? SHE THINKS - Bastard!  YOU SAY - I dunno. Do you? YOU MEAN - How much does she know? SHE THINKS - How much does he know?  By the time she asks you this question, you're already in deep trouble. It doesn't really matter what you say, as long as you don't blush when you answer.  Let's look at an example that calls for more straight-forward lying.  'WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?'  She means, 'You were looking at that girl, weren't you?' And you thought you'd perfected the trick of keeping your neck still and just letting your eyes swivel. Obviously, the truth is not the best answer here. We all know that the truth can set you free, sometimes before you've found somewhere else to stay. It may seem easy enough to answer this question with a cunning lie, but when men are caught off-guard, their ability to deceive is impaired.  Here are a few of the more common mistakes men make when asked 'What are you looking at?':  TOO SPECIFIC: 'The rust around the bolts on the handle on the flap of that mailbox on the northwest corner'.  NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH: 'That thing.'  TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE: 'A diamond necklace in that window back there that would be perfect on you'.  TOO TRUE TO BE GOOD: 'A see-through nightie in that window back there that would be perfect on you.'  TOO OBVIOUS: 'Nothing.'  WAY TOO OBVIOUS: 'That blonde babe over there with the big...I mean nothing.'  Here's one that requires a little interpretation.  'SHOULD I GET MY HAIR CUT?'  If you say anything, then when she does get it cut (and let's face it, she's already made up her mind) and she hates it (and she will hate it), it will be your fault. Even if you say absolutely nothing, the best you can hope for is that she will come home with all her hair cut off, stare you straight in the eye and say:  'DOES IT MAKE ME LOOK FAT?'  You're on your own.

       Mood:  Frustrated    Sorry for the delay in doing this journal cos my damn pc so how is bloody slow and stuff and i have to clear some programs.. *argh*  + feeling lazy to think and write. haha~ Actually not really in the mood ryte now. I'm trying my best wat happened yesterday and today.   At school: I've arrived a bit late about 30 mins after my expected time to arrive at school. Not much student councils came at school about 3 guys + muiz's driver. Boy, the room was  TOTALLY  dusty. I've never seen a room so messy with such large amout of dust. Its like it havent been cleaned for a decade already. Hahahaha~ but it was really fun tho. Me, Muiz and Walid were planning to have a sleepover or camping at the school one day.. OOooh~ that'll be fun. and also we were planning to have our very own refrigrerator, sofas, garden.. *dreaming* haha we must be dreaming its impossible for us to have this kinds of things cos we're only be elected for student council for 1 1/2 year. I think tat its just a waste.   WWE Raw Reviews last nite:   The show started with "The Rock". Its been really been a long time thta he didnt came to RAW. Everytime, he talks to the crowd, I can actually feel some goosebumps coming up. I dont know bout U Guys.     Yea~ And The Rock Make fun of Randy Orton and His Dad and Grandpa. hahaha Pretty funny.      1st Match:  Trish Stratus (c) Vs. Victoria  for the Women's Title. Women’s Champion Trish Stratus (with Tyson Tomko) defeats Victoria. Here I find that the Referee is so stupid! Why i say stupid??! Well Trish Cheated by pinning vICTORIA WHILE hold on the ropes IN FRONT of The REferee! iSnt that Stupid?!! See for Urself:      2nd Match:  Kane vs. William Regal . The match between William Regal and Kane never officially gets underway. No comment on it. But Eric Bishoff is an  ASSHOLE!       This time, the Big Red Monster delivered damning news just before the adoring and pregnant Lita could accept Matt Hardy’s heartfelt marriage proposal. Much to Lita’s dismay, Kane revealed that he’s likely the father — not Matt. And after braving some of the most death-defying matches in WWE history, a distraught Matt could do little more than flee the scene. I knew it!! Kane wa the father of the child. I wonder how the Baby will look like..  *evil laughs*        3rd Match:  Tag Team Match: Randy Orton and Batista Vs. Edge and Chris Jericho .Randy Orton and Batista def. Edge and Chris Jericho. Hope that Edge will have another opportunity to get the Intercontinental Title. Hate To c Randy still having that title. hmph!!    *Jericho In Pain*      *Batista powerbombed Edge*      *Randy About to give the RKO to Edge*    The Main Event:  Triple H vs. Eugene . Triple H and Eugene wrestle to a no contest. Eric Bishoff Demanded Triple H to destroy Eugene before he was going to pinned eugene after delivering the Pedigree. Then Trips took a chair outside out of the ring and try to hammer Eugene with it. Luckily Chris Benoit was here to save Eugene and took the Chair from Trips and The rest of the Evolution came into the ring but unfortunately, Chis Benoit accidentaliy hit Eugene with the chair. Immediately while Benoit was in shocked , Trips immediately took the chair from him and hit Chris Benoit. Evolution conquered the ring.             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Today nothing much happen. This afternoon, i've downloaded an anti-virus software from microsoft.com where they recommend to use this software if my PC's performance is slow. After i downloaded, i restart the PC. Then the computer acted a bit weird. When i open my desktop it took about 30 Minutes to upload evrthing. Then I know i really have to delete or remove some of the useless programs in my PC. After hours of removing 2/3 programs and few times of restarting the PC, the PC still acted the same. Then i tried to delete the Anti-Virus software that i downloaded earlier. And to my surprise the PC is no longer slow. Hahaha~ Now.. I dont think that Microsoft is not to reliable since this happen. So guys becareful what u download form Microsft website. hahaha It could happen to You.  *evil giggle*   Ok Till Next Time,  Sayonara~    Hazim x0x0x0x0x

       Mood:  Love is in the Air *sigh*    First of all the trip was so.. so.. i dont know. its kinda boring to me. Cos we didnt get to do much at all & wat's even worst i should say is bringing my  STUPID ASEAN NOTES  which I need to be prepare.  *argh*     Thumbs Up  during the trip: 1. Chit Chat with my granparents especially my grandma who i really miss the most! 2. Met my Uncle; Azmi. Talked to him about plans of building a website. His gonna help me. 3. Grandma's Home made cooking! *Yum!*   Thumbs Down  during the trip: 1. Taking a COLD bath. *No Hot Steamin Water* 2. Study the stupid ASEAN Notes.   This morning, a frend of mine I dont know but it was a frend, msg me this morning and said Hi! How r u and stuff. But i cant figure out who was it cos most of my frends contact number were all kept in my mobile which is being repaired in the shop. So at te mo' im using my old mobile phone that there was not alot of my frends contact number. So i asked that personn to identify him/herself. And the person replied back and said that "Now ur trying to forget ur old frends and didnt need old frends anymore." What the hell is this? i really didnt mean to. So i tried and explain but after i reply HIS/HER MSG,that person doesnt seem to answer. I really hope that person will understand what im trying to say .   Man! Farah have been in my mind eversince i last chat with her. Cos we both really have something in common and she really do make me happy. I felt like im in love again u c. The problem is I already have a girlfrend and i dont want to have 2 gfs cos 1 is enough. + I dont wanna lose Farah or my gf u c. So guys if u cud speak out and help me. It does really helps! What shud i do? Im really in a love sick u c.      So cool pictures:   Found Of This from  http://www.nodqforums.com  *Really Cool*     Here's some I Caught Up:           Ok then Till Next Time,   Hazim xXXXx
