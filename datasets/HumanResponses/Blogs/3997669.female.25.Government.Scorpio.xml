      Well, I have 2 hours until I'm finished for the day (thank goodness!) and then I don't have to come back into work until next Monday because Guy and I are going up to Newcastle for the weekend. We don't leave until Thursday morning but tomorrow we are going to see an immigration consultant about Guy's sponsorship. We're applying for him to become a permanent resident (not a citizen) and to do that, I'm going to sponsor him. Basically I just have to say that I'll take responsibility for him financially&nbsp;and show proof that we've been together for a year, which we will have&nbsp;been&nbsp;in&nbsp;October. We have to show proof of joint financial ventures (bank account), utility bills, travel, entertainment (movies etc) We also have to get statutory declarations from our friends/family stating that they know we have been together for 12 months etc etc. It's a lot of work but I think it will go through fine, especially considering we know&nbsp;people who have been through the process, lied and got through,&nbsp;and we're being completely honest.&nbsp;  Just in case you're interested (don't blame you if you're not!) but the rats are starting to get better. Their tails are starting to clear up but they're still chewing themselves loads. Poor little things. Hopefully they'll be ok with us gone for a few days, I'm a bit worried about them.  Oh by the way, did you like the photo on my profile? It's old now, but I chose one of my most hideous just to impress you all! It was taken in London (Angel) at a Warp Records party where I got to meet Bjork and we watched Aphex Twin play. Very cool indeed. I think I look like Bugs Bunny in this photo - I was very drunk on Vodka &amp; Red Bull at the time.

      While playing with our pet rats Bruno and Jasper last night, we found that they had little red marks and scabs on their tails. Everything else seemed to be ok, except for a couple of little bumps on Bruno's ears. So this morning we took them to the Vet, thinking that it was either a skin irritation or mites. The Vet did a skin scraping from Bruno's tail and couldn't find any mites/lice but found eggs! Ewwww! He even showed us through the microscope, it was pretty gross. So we were given some bird mite/lice spray (?) and told to clean out their cage thoroughly (as we always do)&nbsp; and to spray them and their cage.   So then we came home, had a cup of tea (thanks to Guy!) &nbsp;and started on the laborious task of cleaning out their cage from top to bottom - even more thoroughly than usual, while the rats seemed completely oblivious to our toil as they ran about on the stairs. After all the events of the day and the rats journey in the box to the Vets, they were all tuckered out and after several bits of cheese for being so good,&nbsp;fell asleep curled up in a little ball&nbsp;together in their hammock. Guy and I, knackered, curled up in a little ball on the lounge and watched a documentary on Tasmanian Devils.   Tonight we're off to an Italian restaurant with my brother Jason for dinner, so that should be cool. It's&nbsp;too cold here to do anything&nbsp;that involves being outside&nbsp;for too long.&nbsp;The days get to a maximum of 13 degrees or so, which in UK terms is nothing but after being back in Oz for a while now, it's bloody freezing! Sometimes I think our flat is colder than it is outside too which doesn't help.&nbsp;

      I can't sleep - It's 11.55pm and Guy is snoring away as usual (I find it very hard to get to sleep - and yes I've tried *everything*) So&nbsp;I thought I would share something amusing with you. My boyfriend's name is Guy Hawksworth and he was in the Navy for 6 years (hey stop laughing, that's not the amusing part!) Anyway, one day we were bored and doing searches for each other's names (as you do) and his full name came up with only one match...   urlLink http://www.themysteryreader.com/goldberg-exposure.html

      Have you ever thought to yourself "What the hell am I doing here?" I guess this can be taken in any number of ways. Why am I alive? Why am I working here? Why am I&nbsp;in this city?   Well today I'm thinking "Why am I working here?" I've had this thought for quite some time now and it's not so much a problem with this place exactly, it's more a problem with what I do. I've got 4.5 years experience in IT support, I've managed to get through that time with the&nbsp;minimum amount of training, mostly getting by with on-the-job experience.&nbsp; It's not just that I hate studying, it's that I don't truly enjoy the line of work that I do. I feel very undervalued, I'm sick of talking to customers on the phone all day&nbsp;and my voice is constantly croaky.   I'm on a Service Desk (helpdesk) you see and after 4.5 years you would think that I would have progressed past this by now. The problem is, that I *have* - when I lived in London, I got into Desktop Support and they provided me with Microsoft Training. I completed 2 MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional) exams in Windows NT - to give you an idea, that was two Operating Systems ago so needless to say, they're pretty out of date now. Seeing as I haven't updated any of my certificates since then, it's near impossible to get any positions other than senior helpdesk&nbsp;roles. I don't want to do any more studying in IT - I'm bored with it. I think I'm pretty good at it and I get a buzz out of solving the complex problems, but the everyday boring calls and abuse I get on the helpdesk are just making the job unbearable.   So what am I going to do? I have no idea... I would sincerely love to do something different and my brother Jason tells me that I was always the smartest out of us three siblings. Now I'm not too sure about that, but I certainly did the least amount of work at high school!&nbsp;He thinks that I'll be good at anything I put my mind to, but I have no idea *what* I want to put my mind to!   When I left school, I wanted to be a journalist so I went to uni in Western Sydney and started a BA in Communications. I dropped out after 1.5 semesters. So I seem to have this problem where I'm either really interested in something and I'll stay with it for a long time or not at all interested and drop it straight away. There is never any between, it's always all or nothing and I have major problems in sticking with something if I don't like it, I'm just not a patient person in that respect. I always seem to be on the look out for something better or more interesting or more challenging.   I really need to start thinking about what I'm going to do with my life. A friend of a friend recently said that you never truly know what you want to do, that&nbsp;nothing changes. She's 37, I'm 25 - will there ever be any hope for me?

      Welcome one and all to my new blogger. Spawned from the original LiveJournal "allyinoz" which fell by the wayside, I will now attempt to keep this more up to date with my current thoughts and life stories. Enjoy :)

      Ok, so as well as getting the humdrum stuff out of my head, I was hoping this log would promote some discussion. So far, that hasn't. I don't know if it's that nobody is reading this or whether people just aren't commenting. In order to remedy this, in the style of one of my favourite movies and books High Fidelity, please list your all-time favourite top 5 movies...  Mine would be (in no particular order):  1) Edward Scissorhands 2) High Fidelity 3) Lord of the Rings trilogy (I guess that's kinda cheating, but hey it's my blog!) 4) Amelie 5) Run Lola Run

      Well, nothing much is going on here in  urlLink Melbourne . It's still cold in the mornings but the sun has been out for the last few days so it looks as though Spring is finally starting to creep in. Thank goodness, I've had enough of Winter and rain and cold.  The weekend was spent doing very little - we had to buy more wood for the rats' play area because they keep jumping out (I had no idea they could jump so high) so more DIY is required. We had breakfast out on Saturday morning and did the grocery shopping - we were going to go out on Saturday night but the weather was so horrible with wind, rain and cold, that we ended up staying in. Guy watched  urlLink Ocean's Eleven  and I played a game called  urlLink Lionheart  on the PC. Sunday we just mooched about in the city, had a wander around  urlLink JB Hi-Fi , had a roast dinner and then had a visit from my brother Jason.  Oh one funny thing that happened - Guy and I were mucking around in  urlLink Bunnings  (the Aussie version of  urlLink B&Q ) and all of a sudden, a voice came over the loudspeaker "Security to section... " We looked around nervously, thinking that it was about us but we didn't see anyone coming. I guess you had to be there, but we must have looked so guilty cos we were mucking around and then froze as soon as we heard the announcement. Every time we started doing something stupid, the voice came over again. Talk about paranoia!  Last night I caught up with an Irish friend, Ellie. We used to spend quite a lot of time together last year but then through various circumstances ended up doing our own thing. She leaves Melbourne on Thursday to do some travelling up the east coast and then over to Fiji before flying back to Dublin. It's strange, it doesn't feel like it was almost a year ago that I met her. We went to Starbucks for a coffee for about an hour, but then she had to rush off. It was good to catch up with her before she left.

      Argh! Today is the most boring day at work. You know how I usually complain that it's too busy etc etc? Well today it is B*O*R*I*N*G. There are hardly any calls coming through and the ones that have been coming through are shitty little problems that we can fix in a minute or have to log to another team. I feel myself falling into a peaceful slumber...  Oh crap, the phone's ringing woke me up!

      Yes, it seems that I am currently addicted to  urlLink The Sims . I know, I know, I'm a bit behind the times and I always seem to get into things long after everyone else has. Not because I'm trying to be cool but because it just takes me so long to get around to trying stuff. So I've had it on my PC since I bought the thing and only just started playing it on the weekend when I was bored. I've been tired every day at work since, due to staying up late playing it. Poor Guy dozes off in bed and then I wake him up when I decide to go to bed. So this morning I decided to take action and I uninstalled it. I don't have the installation discs either, so it's gone... kapput. Usually Guy and I sit and watch TV together at night but I've been busy playing the Sims and in all honesty, I wasn't going very well so I'm glad it's gone!  I seem to get addicted to things like that - things that I'm really interested in, I'll go a bit batty and do them all the time. There's another game called  urlLink Nox  that my friend installed for me when she built my PC. I played it for hours and hours until finally I got to a point where the game crashed. I spoke to a few colleagues and they said that they'd had the same problem with a dodgy copy they'd downloaded off the net, so I never got to finish it. That one wasn't so bad though because Guy enjoyed it too.  I get like that about books too - I just *have* to read them and read them until they're finished, I hate putting them down. I'm now onto my third novel by  urlLink Dan Brown  in a matter of months, as well as having read other books in between - like  urlLink The Life Of Pi  and  urlLink Girl With A Pearl Earring .  I had my review with my team leader and manager yesterday - I told them I wasn't interested in being on the service desk anymore and that I wanted to move into a more technical area. They basically said that I have carved a little niche for myself with the video conferencing support and I need to train someone up to my level before they would even consider moving me off to help desktop support. They also made comments similar to my last employer about wanting to merge the service desk and desktop support to create a multi skilled area. In my experience, this doesn't work. Desktop support staff don't want to "step back" to service desk level, because it *is* seen as a step back and I can understand that. Then my manager blathered on about what it was like when he moved here from England 35 years ago. Don't get me wrong, it was very interesting but not when I was supposed to be getting feedback. I hate office jobs :(

      I had *so* much trouble getting out of bed this morning - I always have difficulty but this morning I just couldn't open my eyes and it was so cold. Not the cold you get in the UK but cold enough to warrant staying in bed and not getting up until midday!  In my ideal world, I would start work late morning and finish mid afternoon... hang on, what am I saying? In my ideal world I wouldn't even have to work!!! Ok, so in my ideal but closer to reality world, that's how it would work. Strange to think that I once had a job just like that. I worked at Fraser Motorcycles in Newcastle as a record keeper/receptionist. It was an easy job and not challenging in the least, but I started at 12pm and finished at 5.30pm Monday to Friday and then worked a full day Saturday. This allowed me to do whatever I liked in the morning (even an early lunch out or a swim at the beach) and then still finish at a reasonable time, especially in the Summer. I worked with a great bunch of people (except for the office manager who was a bit of an old hag but nice enough) and we had great regular customers. Strangely enough, when I worked there, I longed to be back in IT but that was years ago now. If I could mix that with some technical ability, then I think I would have the perfect job. But who knows? I probably wouldn't be happy even then, maybe I'm just one of those people who's never happy with what she has.  I have my half yearly review at work today - I managed to miss it last week as I had a day off but they rescheduled it :( I'm both looking forward to it and not at the same time. I've decided I'm going to tell them how I feel about my job. I know it's not their fault but everyone here is feeling the same way and after 4.5 years I can't believe I'm still on a helpdesk. We have no procedures in place and this whole setup (or lack thereof) is ridiculous. I feel sorry for the other guys I work with - most are in their late 20s or early 30s, have been doing IT for more than 5 years and are still answering phones. There just aren't any decent IT jobs here in Melbourne. If I wanted to move up to Sydney I would probably find more jobs and for better pay but I've lived in Sydney before and I'd prefer to be in Melbourne.  All I seem to do on this weblog is moan about work and talk about the rats - my life is more interesting than that... honest!

      *Bleugh* I hate Mondays! Ok ok, so I know most people do, but today has just been awful. It seems that anything that could possibly stop working, did. You name it - servers, networks, everything. Just as we were trying to log the hundreds of calls, our call logging application Remedy fell over too. What a fantastic morning! Thankfully it's not so busy this afternoon.  The weekend was good, but not long enough as usual. I didn't have to go over the border to Cambodia or anything, thank goodness! (See my mate's weblog  urlLink http://thailand.blogs.com ) Friday night was spent on the couch relaxing after a horrible week's work. Saturday, we slept in and then went out to buy a few things for the rats. It started pouring with rain while we were in the pet shop near the Queen Victoria Markets (famous in Melbourne) so we decided to stop for lunch at this Italian cafe across the road. I had the best Penne Alla Matriciana ever. It was perfect, just the right amount of chilli (I don't like too much) Saturday night I stayed in and finished "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown while Guy went out with some old travelling buddies. Yesterday we had a late breakfast with my brother, did the grocery shopping and then came home to chill out.  I've been looking around at management couple opportunities. It's the only job I can think of that I would really enjoy (or at least I think so) Here in Australia, if you go to  urlLink www.careerone.com.au  and then do a search for all of Oz with a keyword 'couple' it brings up a whole heap of management opportunities. Most of these are for caravan parks or holiday villages. There seems to be loads in far north Queensland at the moment, especially Cairns. Some require previous experience but others just ask for one person with office experience and the other with maintenance experience. Guy and I have talked about it and we both agree that living up in tropical Queensland, even if just for a year, would be a brilliant experience. We can't really go ahead and apply for them until the whole sponsorship thing goes through and Guy has temporary residency though so for now we have to wait *ho hum*

      Well it's just after 11am on Saturday morning and so far not much has been accomplished. I was awake at 8am after being in bed at 11pm last night but fell asleep for another hour and a half and then mooched about for a bit. Don't you love that about weekends? The rain was pouring down again this morning and we were all toasty and warm in bed. What a great day to not have to go to work.  So what to do for the rest of the weekend? Well we need to go to a hardware store to build a new run for the rats, we've also got to do some grocery shopping (how exciting!) and that's about it really. I guess that means we've got plenty of time in which to do not much at all.  I need a few days of inactivity after my horrendous week at work. It seems that when I'm away, nobody looks after the video conferencing which is what I've been trying to train everyone up in. I would have thought that people wanted to know about it because it's pretty exciting and a way of the future (if nothing else, it looks good on your CV) But no, nobody really takes any notice of it and I get back from a few days away to find it all in total chaos. None of the calls worked while I was away and although I have written up full documentation to support it, nobody even thought to read it. How the hell am I ever going to get off this service desk and try and get a spot in desktop support if they need me at my desk to do this all the time? Argh! The good thing is that we got two major problems sorted out with the equipment yesterday after having problems for several months. Finally a breakthrough!

      The rain has been pouring down here at night recently - the days are cloudy but then at night, the rain starts. It's cold wintery rain too, not the type that you get at the end of a long, hot Aussie summer's day. Monday night when we took the rats to the Vet, we noticed that the pre-school which adjoins our complex had left their rabbits out - later on when the rain was pouring down, we hoped that someone had put them back into their hutch. The next morning on the way to work, Guy noticed that the same rabbits were still out and that nobody was at the pre-school.  So, last night when it stared to rain heavily again, we decided to go and check on the rabbits. Sure enough, they had been left out in the rain. They have a hutch and then a small fenced off area that they can run around outside in. There were two of them, huddled into the corner of the fence, soaking wet. We checked the little door to their hutch and the hinge has been attached so that they can go outside from the hutch but can't go back in. After trying to think of what to do, Guy grabbed a large stick and poked it through the fence to hold the door open and then weighed the end of the stick down with a large post. This kept the door open and one of the rabbits went straight for the safety of the hutch while the other one, scared, stayed in the furthest corner from us. Then we realised that there were other rabbits inside the hutch and some of them were coming out and going back in again now too.  Pleased with ourselves, we started praising each other's kindness and walked back to the house (the whole fiasco had taken us about 25 minutes) While walking back, I said to Guy "You don't think they were deliberately separated because of their sex do you?" to which he replied "Don't even say that" Anyway, regardless of that, the ones outside should have at least had some shelter and food outside, which they didn't.  Tonight we're off to see The Streets in St Kilda - if you don't know them, they're some guys from the UK who sort-of rap (I don't know what you'd call it) about everyday stuff, for example "Fit but don't you know it" about a good looking girl who knows she's attractive. It's mostly blokey sort of stuff - checking out girls, drinking beer, etc. The songwriter/singer is from Birmingham but moved to London in his youth so he's got a half and half sort of accent. Should be good.

      Well I'm back to reality now - Guy and I arrived back from Newcastle yesterday afternoon. It was lovely up there, but it didn't seem long enough (never does!) We spent a great 4 days just hanging about mostly - I was roped into upgrading my Dad's PC to Windows XP and then sorting out my Mum's laptop with Windows 98. They had never done any Windows Updates so it was having loads of problems. Anyway, we had my Stepmum's birthday on Friday night and I got to catch up with all of my relo's, we also went out on Dad's (small) yacht on Saturday, then out for dinner with Mum and John on Saturday night. It was about 4 degrees warmer than it is down here in Melbourne, but the temperature dropped from about 18 degrees during the day to about 4 degrees at night, so we felt it more than having 14 degrees during the day and 8 degrees at night. Those 4 degrees certainly made a difference though, especially with the most beautiful clear blue skies you have ever seen!  The rats were happy to see us back and we're taking them to the Vets again tonight to get them some medicine for their mites as the spray hasn't worked. Apparently you can give them a small dose of sheep/horse medication for worms/parasites so hopefully it will work.
