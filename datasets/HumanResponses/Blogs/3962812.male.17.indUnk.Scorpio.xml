      I probably should have included this in my last entry, but I completly forgot. Now, it seems a big story has arisen in the news later. A 17 yr old, bludgeons a 14 yr old to death with a hammer. Now, what could possibly be the reason for this? Apparently it's because he played a video game. That's right folks, peoples stupidity has finally reached an all-time high, I seriously fucking can't believe these idiots are trying to pin somebodies death COMPLETLY on a video game.  I could possibly understand if he was slightly influenced by a violent game, but I do not think a video game MADE HIM KILL SOMEBODY. As you can tell, I feel very strongly on this matter and think that the victims parents are fucking cretins. They're looking for somebody to blame over their son's death and aren't looking at the cause.  I mean, there's much worse movies, that show people killing people etc, surely all of these are responsible for killing people as well? Surely all these gorey films make people think 'I KNOW LETS GO KILL SOMEBODY!', Seriously fuck off if you believe this. People have the right to make their own decisions and aren't forced to do anything. A slight influence may have come from the game, but a game does not make somebody want to kill someone.   Obviously the 17 yr old has mental problems and it seems the victims family want to overlook these and blame a video game. How suiting that the prosthetic world we live in want to blame some of the prosthetic goods we place all of our values upon.  I seriously think the world would be a better place if 99% of the people were dead. There is far too much idiocy in the world today.  Peace  xxxx

      Yep I'm back, so here we go again.  I've heard NOTHING from Angela since the rose incident. Disappointing, disheartening and depressing...wow I should start writing, wait...I do...and that's shit too.  So yeah, enter mega 'can not be arsed with life' mood. Because right now, guess what? That's how I feel. I don't understand why Angela aint e-mailed me or txt me :( Not even saying 'Hi', nothing. Well do I care? Yeah I do, I don't know why, I don't know why I'm beating myself up over it, looking in the mirror and thinking 'What the fuck's wrong with me?' but I am. I seem to have taken about 100 steps in the wrong direction.  I feel inadequate and like a reject. I find it harder and harder to believe that there is 'somebody out there for me', which I keep getting told. So please excuse me whilst I go puke in disgust at the appearance of my own face.  Moody? Fuck yeah...Reason to be? Fuck yeah....Reason to , be>/b>? No....So why do I carry on? Maybe there is still a part of me that hopes everything's going to work out. Though, how I've managed to have even the smallest part of me being positive, I don't know.  Signing off.  Sir Fuckupalot

      Woooo lets be happy, wait lets not. Seen as though I feel like shit right now. Yeah so Angela came on MSN and she obviously hadn't received the rose, then whilst I was talking to her it came.  She seemed happy to receive it but couldn't understand why I sent it, I told her it was because I liked her and even sent her the poem I'd written.   Take this rose I offer, A token of my feelings, A mere declaration from the heart,  Do not fear any thorns, For I will be your defence, To any harm which may arise,  If you take my hand, The path may be winding, And the road may be long, But I promise, I'll never leave you, Always by your side, Forever more...   She said 'aww' lots and thanked me for the rose, but that was about it. I seriously don't know what to think. I had to go so didn't get any chance to speak to her and I won't be able to get online for a week. So meh, I dunno what's gonna happen.  Take Care All, I'll post again in a week.  XXXX

      Yep. So what did I do today....hmmm...went round Alex's, played on the Gamecube, came home. Oh yeah and had a driving lesson this morning...fun. So yeah what an exciting life I lead at the moment.   Tommorrow is Judgement Day heh, the rose is being sent tommorrow morning. So, could be good or bad. I'm hoping for the best so I can be happy again heh. I really haven't got much more to say. I'm sure I will have tommorrow.  Take Care All  xxx

      Right, this is going to pretty brief because right now I'm tired. I went round Alex's today, played computer games, did a bit of Backyard Wrestling, got knackered and came home. Was nice for a change heh, am going round again tommorrow and Mark's going to be there wooo :)  But yeah, that's nothing compared to what I've done today. I've thought long and hard and well Ness is a nice girl and all I really just find her attractive, I hardly evern know her. Though I don't know Angela that well I've spent quite a bit of time with her already and well, the first full day I spent with her was one of the best of my life and I wasn't even going out with her. She just seems to cheer me up, whether I get just a text off her, or whether I speak to her on MSN, my mood just seems to change.  So I stayed good to my own word, I've ordered a rose for her, not a shitty one either. The most expensive one I could find heh, it's getting delivered to her house Friday morning. Â£25.75 including delivery, money that I really can't afford. I wrote on the card 'I was going to get you a white rose, but I knew you preffered red. Take Care xxx' her mate Laraine is going to be there to make sure she's in and gets it, and possibly hint that it was me that sent it lol.  I got worried though, I was speaking to Angela on MSN and she said she might not be in Fri morning, so I quickly rang Laraine and she said that she'd make sure Angela was in because she'd be there with her. Heh, I felt better when she said that, I got really stressed when I thought she wasn't going to be in heh. Anyways, I'm glad that's sorted now, I just hope she realizes that it's not just about the fact that I've spent money on her, it's what this symbolizes. I really do think I'm falling in love with her, and this is just a token of my feelings I have for her right now.  This could really fuck me up bad, if even after this and I've given the poem I've written to her, she still only sees me as a friend I'm going to feel shitty. Whether she's nice about it or not it'll hurt, I'm just hoping for the best at the moment and we'll see what happens. Who knows? For once it might work out, but maybe that's just wishful thinking. I'm going to go soon, my hands are tired because of how fast I've typed this and I'm tired myself anyways heh. She said she'd be back on MSN soon, I might just wait for her, have a quick chat then go.  Take Care All xxxxx

       In the morning I am empty Of every thing I used to be I write away the feelings  So no one will ever read  If I had all of the answers I could pour salt on my wound I could fill this room with sorrow So no one would ever see  I want to wake up and drink from your river I want reach out and tear down the sky To know I'm alive yeah and I want learn how to feel without bleeding I want to learn how to live by your side You're no longer mine  Then why We got to swim against the tide to each other Send me on the side of the river Then why  If I offered you a picture And the paint is yet to dry Could you live with just a whisper A flower is meant to die  If I had all of the answers I could pour salt on my wound I could fill this room with sorrow So no one would ever see  I want to wake up and drink from your river I want to reach out and tear down the sky To know I'm alive I want learn how to feel without bleeding I want to learn how to live by your side To know that your mine  Then why We got to swim against the tide to each other Send me on the side of the river  Then why We got to swim against the tide to each other Send me on the side of the river Then why   The lyrics to the song I'm listening to right now. Breed 77 - The River, at the moment this song is making me feel slighly better. I don't know why but it seems to ease the pain. I feel a lot better about the whole picture thing now, the initial shock of it effected me more than anything I think, but I'm trying my best not to think about it now.  I've spoke to a few people and shown them this, all seem to give me pretty useful advice. Though one quote sticks in my mind. Nat said 'tbh i don't think you're gonna be happy with yourself til you've found someone you click with' and I think she's probably right. I think maybe it's a fault in my personality, this longing to have somebody by my side, to have somebody to confide in, to comfort me, to love...  I say fault because most people my age love their life. They have it easy at home, they don't have to work and go out and pull random people. I see it as a fault because although it may be a good thing that I want commitment so badly, people my age don't see it like that. Girls my age go for older guys if they're looking for commitment and slightly younger girls don't want commitment. That leaves me with nothing. Heh.  Another song that seems to have a lot of meaning to me is 'Vermillion - Part 2' by Slipknot. Practically all Slipknot songs mean something to me and I can relate to them, but this one, as it stands means the most to me.   She seemed dressed in all of me, stretched across my shame.  All the torment and the pain  Leaked through and covered me  I'd do anything to have her to myself  Just to have her for myself  Now I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do when she makes me sad.   She is everything to me  The unrequited dream  A song that no one sings  The unattainable, Shes a myth that I have to believe in  All I need to make it real is one more reason  I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do when she makes me sad.   But I won't let this build up inside of me  I won't let this build up inside of me  I won't let this build up inside of me  I won't let this build up inside of me   A catch in my throat choke Torn into pieces I won't, NO! I don't wanna be this...  But I won't let this build up inside of me  I won't let this build up inside of me  I won't let this build up inside of me  I won't let this build up inside of me   She isn't real  I can't make her real  She isn't real  I can't make her real   Basically to me, it represents that perfect girl that I could be with, yet all that she is is an mere illusion, fake hope to cling onto that will never become real. It's slightly depressing, but strangely comforting as well, knowing Corey's felt like this, yet now it's all turned good for him in his life, he has a beautiful wife and a child. Maybe there is still hope for me yet.  As you may or may not know I owe my life to Slipknot. Call me pathetic, call me whatever the fuck you want, but it's true. I started listening to the first album round about when I got depressed the worst. It helped me out of it and gave me something to cling to, a life-line if you will. I related to the angst Corey felt towards the world and the idiots that populate it. Not only did I end up loving the music it, it meant more to me than any other band ever could. It gave me something to aspire to, something to look up to. Nine men whom had all probably been through a helluva lot of shit just like myself, yet they were still standing saying 'Fuck You' to the people that had hurt them. Just by typing this I feel stronger, just by thinking this through in my head I'm feeling better. When people call Slipknot I get pissed off, not because they don't like the music, but because they don't understand. Music isn't just noise to me, especially not Slipknot.   My final thought for this post, try looking deeper into things. Whether it be when your partner tells you they love you, whether it be the music you listen to, or whether it be that friend who's always there for you. Look deeper and realize what it's all about, try and find a meaning to everything, because in most cases there is one.  Your partner probably does love you and wants to be with you forever, take that bond and do something about it. Take meaning's from the lyrics you hear from your music, actually listen to what the band are trying to say with it. Don't just dismiss it as noise. And finally look at your friend who's always there. Why are they always there for you? Maybe they care about you more than you realize...  I may feel slighlty better now, but probably not for long, I'm still feeling generally shitty so yeah...  Take Care All xxxx

      I sit here now writing this tears are trying so hard to run down my cheeks to freedom. The wound in my heart I thought was closed has just re-opened.   I just went to find an old cd for Ness, to check if it was the one she'd lost and said she could have it. When I looked under my cd cases I saw the picture. It'd been there for over a year and a half, but still it looked perfect. Me and Adele sitting there together. Me looking completly different to what I am now. So happy, not a care in the world.  I still remember now how she'd really not wanted it taken, but I begged her to cause I wanted something to put in my wallet so I'd always be able to see her when I was feeling down. Seeing that picture brought back so many memories, all good, apart from the last one.  The one where I split up with her over an argument, a stupid little argument that meant nothing. I threw away everything because of that. The only girl I ever truely loved and I threw it away. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for that, I had everything yet I was so stupid and young and careless just to throw away my happiness.  A few months ago I asked her if there was a chance of getting back together. I found out that there wasn't going to be any second chances for me cause of circumstances, I had well and truely fucked things up.  Now after every single relationship afterwards has lasted no longer than three weeks I have to wonder if it's me. If I'm the one who's fucking things up, am I driving my g.f's to cheat on me? Am I driving them away? There have been one or two again where I've finished people for no reason and I don't even know why, Nat, for instant. I finished her for no reason at all....I still regret that as well but there's nothing I can do about that now.  Maybe I'm just destined to fuck up when I've got a good thing, all I seem to have is regrets of stupid decisions I've made. Maybe I won't be happy because of who I am and the way I am. I've fucked up a couple of good relationships up to now with no reason to, so how many more am I going to end up fucking up?

      So yeah, I had to get up early this morning cause of the decorator coming round. I'm going to be left on my own with him later when my Dad goes hospital. He's got something wrong with one of his eyes, or something, yeah so I hope that gets sorted. This morning I played Day Of Defeat for three hours, I swear I'm getting addicted to that game, in the past three days I must have played it for about 12 hours, that is surely not good lol...But at least I'm getting better at it :)  As I sit here and write this I'm wondering about last night, about Angela, about a lot of things really. Ness just signed on, she's like really amazing and unfortunately just a friend. I've been talking to her on MSN a lot lately and she's been having problems with her b.f. He treats her like shit but cause she loves him and believes that he loves her she's still with him. She said to me earlier today that if he upests her again she's going to finish him. If I were her I would have finished him a long time ago, but yeah I'm trying my best not to interfere where it's not my business so I've just given impartial advice to her, though it's been tempting to just fuck that and say 'Dump him, go out with me I'd treat ya right', cause I sure as hell would. She's one of the sweetest people you could ever meet and to boot she's incredibly good looking, thus why a guy like me wouldn't stand a chance with her.  She's one of those girls who could have any guy she wanted, but she doesn't realize it, which makes her even nicer. A girl who's pretty but not vain, qualities that usually match nowadays, pretty girls seem to think they can treat people like shit, this really pisses me off at college the most, they way they look down on anybody their own age and think they're too good for us, that really gets to me.  But yeah, Ness has made comments about my pics and that I'm good looking, but I'm not sure if she's just being friendly. She was sending me pics of her mates before asking me if I liked them or not, cause she was gonna set me up with one of them, but then she said I'd send ya a pic of myself, but I've got a b.f. This struck me as really weird, she's obviously thought about me as more than a mate, but if that will ever come into reality or not I don't know.  She's said she'd split up with her boyfriend before, but it didn't happen. I can't really see them splitting up and I wouldn't want her to split up with him over me, cause I don't split up couples just to make myself happy. I've tried my best not to flirt with her, tho I have said some suggestive things, but I think she just thought I was being friendly. As long she's happy I'll try and be happy for her, but I am really jealous of her b.f. He doesn't realize what an awesome g.f he's got and I seriously hope he gets a reality check and changes how he is, because as it stands nearly every time I've spoke to her she's been upset because of him. I may like her, but she's also a really good mate and I don't like seeing her upest as she doesn't like seeing me upset either.  Yet, in the back of my mind I feel guilty just for even taking a liking to Ness when I'm sort of pursuing Angela. I feel as though I shouldn't be thinking about any other girls other than Angela because of how much I like her, yet I'm starting to like Ness just as much. The problem is I'm not going to have anybody because even if I do get a chance with either of them I'll probably fuck it up, I'm good at that.  A few weeks back one of my mates 'Nat' from Law told me her mate really liked me. Well, I as over the moon cause I liked her mate over a year ago but she had a b.f, so I stayed away. I started speaking to her again and we got pretty close, spent some time together at the college fair and I thought everything was going really well.  At this point I'd told her I liked her, but apparently she already knew off a load of other people :-\, I said whatever happens I hope this doesn't ruin our friendship. After the fair she txt me saying. 'See today was cool wasn't it? We're still mates...' and I just knew then that she didn't like me. I txt her asking if we'd ever be more than just mates and she said no, in no uncertain terms. I seriously don't know how I managed to fuck that up when she supposedly really liked me.   So yeah, that was the most recent downfall I faced, and for now I'm going to stop writing. I'm listening to Adema - Pain Inside.  Take Care All xxxx

      Yes I'm writing this because of him, I was going to try starting my novel that I've planned out but that will have to wait till tommorrow now. Well I guess I should start with how I'm feeling in my life right now and what I want from life. Yes this is going to be sooo intresting   So yeah, feel free to stop reading at any point, I still don't even know why I'm writing this.  At this moment in time in my life I seem pretty happy, though I've still got low confidence due to my past and the way people have treated me. I think I'm slowly starting to find out that I can be more confident as I try new things and do things I'd never have normally done. At last, I seem to have found my indentity, I know who I am now, what I am. I seem to understand myself completly and know why I feel down when I feel down and stupid things that most of you probably don't even think about. But most of all I feel reasonably happy with myself. Something that has haunted me for a long time, all my failure with girls, all the dicks treating me like shit, I put that down to me. I put that down to the fact that there was something wrong with me, thus why I failed with girls and why people treated me different. But now I finally realize, yes I am different to most people, yes I'm not your average guy. But I don't want to be you 'average guy', you're average guy sleeps around with as many girls as he can using them for fun. I don't want to be that man. I'm glad that I'm one of the only people my age who actually has morals and standards and doesn't just go out to 'get laid'. Though I'll admit I made a mistake nearly a year ago, but since then I've been stronger then over on my philosophy over sex.   I really am going to wait for somebody I truely love before I do anything again. My hormones have tried to tell me otherwise, but my heart disagrees. Now onto the topic of girls, I've had a lot of shitty luck with girls, what with them using me/cheating on me and what not and yeah I've had a lot of depression due to it. But I seem to be meeting the right kind of people now and getting to know that there are some genuine girls out there who don't set out just to fuck guys around.  At the moment I seem to have my heart set on one girl even though my mind's saying no. I seriously don't think I have a chance with her, but I'm going to try anyways. One of my mates just summed it up perfectly on MSN, 'What have I got to lose?', the fact is I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain. She's such aa awesome girl and I get on really well with her, not only is she absolutely beautiful, but she's the nicest person to speak to as well. I feel as though I'm getting on really well with her, but there's a lot of interest in her. I don't see how I can surpass the efforts of other lads, whom I see to be far superior to myself. Though I'm going to try and who knows I might just get lucky and she might just see me for who I am. A kind, compasionate guy who just wants to love somebody and for them to love him back. I don't just want a quick shag, or a quick anything. I want a relationship with somebody whom I know it's going to work out with.  I met her back on Tuesday of last week. She sat in front of me and my mate Rob on the coach to Alton Towers. Rob knew her mate so we all got talking and we ended up hanging around all day. I can honestly say that was one of the best days of my life and I really didn't want it to end. Everything just seemed so right, the only thing I felt awkard with was when I had to say bye to her. I just felt as though I wanted to hug her or kiss her goodbye, and to say that I'd be around if she wanted to chat or whatever, but it didn't happen. I just said bye and away she went.  During the day it was mainly four of us, Rob, Lorraine, Me and of course Angela :), but at one point Rob and Lorraine wanted to go on a ride that we didn't and we ended up having a pretty deep conversation. At one point she said I had very nice eyes, I didn't even realize she'd said this until a few seconds after it had happened and I'm pretty sure I didn't comment on it as I completly bottled it. I so wished I'd returned the compliment and just said 'So have you' maybe that would have made all the difference, maybe not. But I'm going to have to leave that in the past now, she gave me her phone number then, so she obviously wanted to stay in touch with me, whether it be as a friend or maybe more. I hope it was for more than just friendship because this is the first time in a while I've liked a girl this much and also been given the opportunity to spend so much time with one.   So yeah, I've just finished talking to her on MSN, Juvie was sorta helping me on what to say and stuff and we talked about alsorts of things, including her star sign and mine and what flowers she liked. I found out she liked pink/red roses, and I told her I like white because they stand out from the crowd yet are still beautiful, this was no word of a lie and is actually how I feel. I'm going to try and get her address off Lorraine so I can send a white rose to her house when I get paid on friday. I'm going to write on the card. 'I know you like pink/red roses, but I like white' and I hope she realizes who it's from.  I'm gonna wrap this up now for today, cause am getting tired and it's getting later, I've been typing for 20 minutes straight now so maybe I should leave it heh, my fingers are aching :-\ lol, anyways I'll probs update tommorrow night, hopefully will have spoke to Angela again by then.  Take Care all...  xxxx

      What did we do today lets seeâ¦  I got up, listened to Moyles on the Radio as always. Went on my computer for a bit chatted to a few different people. Went off and had my two hour driving lesson at 12 which went alright. Came back and had a kick around with Chris Goodwin. Came home and then found out BT are still having problems with their broadband service which is pissing me off a lot.  Other than that Iâm in a good mood again, Iâll probably see a load of people from college tomorrow when I hope I havenât done too bad in my exams. I hope I get the results I wantâ¦but thereâs no point worrying which is what a lot of people seem to be doing.  Roughly about three weeks before I go back to college, I canât wait. All the new people to meet plus get to see all my mates again. I realize how much I really do miss college now that Iâve been away from it for so long. Oh well Iâm hoping these next few weeks are going to fly by.  My boss rung my up the other day asking if Iâd work Friday and Sunday. I said Iâd do Friday and wasnât sure about Sunday. So as it stands Iâm set to be working Thursday, Friday and Saturday, but I want to swap Saturday for Sunday because I want to watch Utd beat Norwich and I want to go out with the family to the pub as well seen as though weâre having a little family outing like we do every once in a while.  So yeah busy times ahead of me, Iâm going meeting Dale at about 12pm tomorrow and then weâre off to get our results. Heâll have aced everything as always heh. I hope my broadband is fixed soon because itâs really starting to annoy me now.   Take Care All xxxxxxxxx

      Yeah it's been a while since I wrote in here. In that short space of time I've...  - Had a g.f, realized I didn't know her so broke up with her to save hurting her further down the line.  - Had a hair cut.  - Gone on a diet.  - Bought some weights.  - Decided to get some muscle on me.  - Bought a new football.  - Finished reading Silence Of The Lambs and started reading Hannibal.  - Watched the film adaption of Red Dragon, very good I must say. That has now become my favourite book.  As it stands I feel great about myself and I've ordered a new t-shirt http://www.engrish-store.com/dangertshirt.html woo woo lol. So yeah, let the good times role. Exam results on Thursday. Driving lesson tommorrow.  Take Care All xxxx

      Yeah well here's a little more detailed look at what happened on Monday.  Me and Dale got on the bus took fucking ages to get to Manchester which takes the piss and it's st00pid cause the train line's being worked on so yeah. We spend an hour or so wandering around and run into Nicola Simms who then starts hanging round with us. Then she finds a mate so there's four of us. We spent up until about 5ish/6ish like that and it was cool.  Then A.J and a few other people turned up, Nicola and her mate went and said they'd ring me cause they'd be back in a bit. They never came back. Probs because Nicola and Guy had a bit of a thing and don't speak to each other now but meh...So yeah, so that left me with Guy, Bauer, A.J, Laurie, Dale and Ruby - Bauer's g.f. I hardly hang around with any of these guys, so none of em really bothered talking to me. Some other people Mel and Del the only two who's names I caught hung around as well, and basically I started feeling left out. I get on alright with A.J and Dale when he's on his own. Then Tom Allen came and he was just obssessed with going seeing Mel and Del. At this point it was about half seven and all they were planning on doing was hanging around Urbis. So fucking boring in my opinion especially when nobody gives a fuck if I'm there or not, so I ended up going home with Laurie, or at least getting the bus with him. He made a bit of an effort to speak to me then which was cool but yeah basically he didn't really want to, I could tell it all seemed forced.  So that brings me onto yesterday...I did absolutely nothing other than sit at home all day. What fucking fun that was...not...  Today I went round Alex's and messed about on Gamecube with him and Mark, that was alright. Got home same old, on the net and for a few reasons I feel really shitty right now, more shitty than normal. What's the saying, one step forward two steps back? That's what I feel keeps happening to me and at the moment I'm about 100,000 steps away from being happy heh.  On a slightly brighter note I think I've found somebody I like who's a mate whom I've never really looked at in that way. Though I'm sure she's never looked at me in that way either. So basically I asked her if she fancied coming out, in a group thing of course, I didn't want to make it too obvious...she goes my college and I hang about with her quite a bit. She's a really nice girl and I know if she likes me she wouldn't hurt me or whatever, but once again I'm going for a girl whom probably only sees me as a friend so I'll probably end up getting hurt. I slipped in my number and asked her to text me if she sorts anything about a group of us going out, smooth eh? But yeah. I'm hoping maybe I'll get a bit of luck with her, who knows.  I gotta keep trying, because eventually I'll find somebody who likes a loser as a b.f heh.  Take Care All xxx

      Yep nothing happened hahaha, how did ya manage to guess that? There was plenty of opporunities, I guess I need to work on my self confidence a bit more :-\ heh, but yeah I finished typing up my short story now wooo so that's good, I sent it to a few people and they like it so that's good. I need to start writing my next one now whilst the idea's fresh in my head.  On other news, I sent a random person a message on faceparty and it turns out it's somebody who lives round the corner from me. Scary :| lol...  So erm yeah, nothing of interest to report.  I bid thee good-day.

      Yep so this is going to be pretty short probably seen as though it's 9AM!!! But yeah, today should be erm interesting :) I'm going into Manc town with Dale, we're gonna go chill at Urbis and stuff, Dales words were 'We gonna go stare at the rock chicks from afar?' LOL, so yeah basically off into Manc we go and we'll see what happens. Hopefully some good fortune after the horrid few weeks I've had recently and I'll try and forget this nasty mess with Angela.  So I bet you can't wait for me to come back now can you? Cause you want to know what happened don't you? Well, I haven't been yet...  Anyways  Take Care All xxxx

      Well, no, not really. Today = Worst Day ever. I find out off Angela's mate she has a b.f now. No wonder she didn't txt me or e-mail me.   My Mum's dead ill again so she's in bed right now.  Yet, I've got to be positive or I'm going to have a fucking break down. I need to try and stay positive. Fuck girls, seriously I can't be arsed anymore, I'm just gonna get messed around if I like anybody so I just won't bother.  I'll write more tommorrow.  For now, take this thought with you...  "You can try as hard as you like, but in the end, it won't matter..."  Profoundness from my mouth.  Take Care xxx
