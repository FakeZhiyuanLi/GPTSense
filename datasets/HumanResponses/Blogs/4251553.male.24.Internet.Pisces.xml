       Dictionary.com has a great setion dedicated solely to discussing obscure words called Word of the Day. With that statement I have just exposed my most guarded secret to the garrulous hoi polloi, much as if the Green Lantern were to divulge his decrepitude to the tender part of the spectrum of lights, commonly know to you humans as 'yellow'.       Current Status: Time: 3:29 pm Cup of Coffee: Lost count after 6 Soundtrack: The groanings of Old Man Justice in the back of my mind Location: Daycare (aka. my office )    I was just scolded.  Scolded.  By my boss. Like a 3 year old. For not responding in a timely fashion to an email that  I never received.  Were it not for the presence of sentient beings, I truly believed he would have tried to spank me. It is days like these that remind me why my soul is bent on replacing this sorry income with a larger, more residual source. Where the only spanking being done is by me, and is in FPS form. With a big gun.     Freedom... freedom... freedom... I can taste it like a succulent pineapple. More on this later.   My time is short, my blog is brief, I eat a tort, I hide my grief.      A quote, to consummate this   circumlocutory harangue...       The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble."    -The Psalmist      --Kurt

       Your heart rate has been a little fast-- are you under any significant stress?     I have a three-and-a-half-year-old boy genius and a twenty-month-old Cookie Monster at home. Not a day goes by that they don't break something. Stress? Me? *twitch* Never!  They want to put me on medicine and make me wear an event monitor for a month. Which is fine-- better to be safe than sorry in matters of the heart. Maybe.  So I go back tomorrow for an echocardiogram and back in 6 weeks when my stickiness is done. If you've ever worn a monitor on your chest for any length of time, I admire you. I had no idea how itchy they are!! At least I can take this one off to shower. It would have been a very  looong  30 days otherwise. Most of my companions today in the Cardiologist office were the walking dead. It was kind of scary! I could literally picture them lying in their coffins-- cold as bones. I pray I have another 60 years before I begin to look like that. I'm sure my husband does too.  Alex is the boy genius in our family. At three years old, he knows more about computers than I do, I think. If he could read or spell, he could hack. We're going to have to give him his own ISP as soon as he begins to type, so that we can promptly blame all mischief on him alone. He designs these elaborate ramps and racetracks out of the vertical blinds he pulls down from the window, but instead of just racing cars down it, he tests the windspeed and velocity of various objects. (My husband can laugh, because he knows I know NOTHING about physics)  Our other boy, Isaac,  is going to be an extreme sports competitor. If it can be climbed on and jumped off of, he immediately climbs it and jumps off. He has already had his first set of stitches, and unless God has selected a legion of angels for him, they will not be his last. He is a maniac.  I guess all moms think their kids are special. I just know mine are.  Awww.... I melt my own heart. *hehe*  Passing the baton to my better half in this 100m Blog Relay...  -Emily

      Hello World.  I have been chastised for lack of blog, hence my text appears before your eyes today. We are still trying to figure this site out -- by that of course I mean that most likely this post will be signed "emily", when in fact it sprang (sprung?) fully formed from the perspicacious mind of her loving spouse. (I WILL be signing my name at the bottom for those of you who are still in the dark...)  Current Status: Time: 2:04 pm Cup of Coffee: 5th Soundtrack: Final Fantasy Reborn playlist ( urlLink fantasyreborn.com ) Location: Temporary Priso... uh, job...  Ok, so what does one blog when not specifically motivated except by threat of force? I suppose I could write a poem...   A shimmering horsefly, clad in....   no, I'll leave the poems to emily. I will however put a plug in for the above linked site. Go there now. Download music. Especially a song called Terra. I guarantee you will like it (unless you have no soul... in which case  urlLink www.souls.com  is down, so I'm not sure what you're gonna do. sorry...)  I'm getting a hair cut today! (more than one, actually...) Woot!!  I hope this is enough ethereal content for a first blog. I feel like I'm writing a really personal letter to everyone and to no one at the same time. I shall leave you with a quote:     "Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called"  -Paul to Timothy  Have a great night! --Kurt

      If you've recently visited Your Favorite Blog, and it isn't your favorite blog, come back.  Either you will be pleasantly suprised by its witty banter and unique subject matter, or you will be disappointed. In our opinion, you haven't lost anything either way.  This is just our blog. It's our favorite blog, and we hope, someday, it will be yours too.  BLOG. BLOG. BLOG.  Today I painted a rock with my son, Alex.  We went into Grandma's rock garden beneath the deck and hand selected two of the finest, smoothest river rocks in the lot.  We brought them inside, washed them off, and proceeded to regurgitate creative masterpiece all over the little stones.  It was highly therapudic. Mine had little tribal colored triangles all over its surface. My son's was scribbled on with pink and black marker. We're going to sell them downtown. (Maybe)  Mondays always seem like a day to start all over again. No matter what mistakes you've made over the weekend or during the past week, Monday is a day to start fresh and new.  I woke up this morning determined to turn over a new leaf.   urlLink dict.die.net  says : To turn over a new leaf, to make a radical change for the better in one's way of living or doing. [Colloq.]            They were both determined to turn over a new leaf.             --Richardson.  Aparently Richardson was the one who came up with the saying? Does anyone know who Richardson is?  So far, I've only baked cookies and painted on a rock, but something deep inside my soul says that I'm on to something.  Maybe I'll read a book.  Goal for the week: Avoid hospital at all costs.  Thanks! -  Emily
