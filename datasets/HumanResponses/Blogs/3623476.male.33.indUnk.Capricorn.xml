      Working away on the script.  I'm about a third of the way through now (35 pages, at last count), and have an outline for the final Act.  I'm thinking of heading up to Hutto this afternoon; a buddy of mine told me there were some great silos out there on the edge of the highway, and I might be able to use these for one of my action sequences.  I also have a book around here somewhere of "Old Texas Ghosttowns" and I plan on digging through it at some point and seeing what I can find.  On the research front, I rented Pale Rider, Outlaw Josey Wales, and the Searchers from my local video store last week.  Re-watched Pale Rider last night.  On the 'just-for-fun' front, I also burned through the first season of the Shield last week, and I doubt the second season will last me through Wednesday.  The writing, acting and cinematography are amazing; if you haven't seen it and you like crime drama, grab it up quickly.  It has a real "Michael Connelly" style to it, which I love.  This one going into my collection right next to Firefly, the show that did everything right and got cancelled anyway.  Oh yeah!  I also went to the Austin Gun & Knife show this weekend.  If you haven't been to one of these before, it's quite a thing to see...  I was looking for some old revolvers, and prop guns (the last time I went to one of these, I picked up a couple of MGM prop six shooters-- still tagged with the MGM props department labels -- but I accidentally sold them off at a garage sale. So now I'm back trying to rebuy the same thing I sold last summer.  Yeah, I know, I'm an idiot.)  This time I didn't do so well.  Other than a bag of beef jerky and a cola, I didn't find muchf interest.  Bought a new cleaning kit for my rifle.  If you're looking to buy a gun (not a speciality prop gun, like I was) I suppose this is the place to be.  Rows upon rows of people hawking semi auto pistols, Mac 10s, scopes, vests, helmets, knives, WW2 medals..  overall, a pretty funky place, and just a little bit scary.  Most of the guys there will cut you a deal if you make them an offer.  I did have my eye on a reproduction colt six shooter with a brass handle (had the cool US Patent 1871 stamp on the side) but we couldn't make the price work, and besides, my wife would kill me.  Eventually I'll break down and buy one, I suppose, but not this weekend.  Maybe I'll try Ebay.

      Okay, so I've started the script.  I started with a concept, scrawled it out into an outline, and checked it against my criteria.  The basic skeleton I'm using is the "Get-Away Story" arc.  Ideas come from all sorts of places, I suppose.  Mine came from a Steve Miller song I'm sure you've heard a million times:  This here's a story about Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue  Two young lovers with nothin' better to do  Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube  And here is what happened when they decided to cut loose   They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso  That's where they ran into a great big hassle  Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle  Bobbie Sue took the money and run   Go on take the money and run  Go on take the money and run  Go on take the money and run  Go on take the money and run   Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas  You know he knows just exactly what the facts is  He ain't gonna let those two escape justice  He makes his livin' off of the people's taxes   Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away  Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day  They got the money, hey  You know they got away  They headed down south and they're still running today  Singin' go on take the money and run  Go on take the money and run  Go on take the money and run   I'm posting in the lyrics because I think they cover the entire range of the get-away story (though obviously the devils in the details, and this story -- like any other -- is certainly bound to have it's fair share of devils.)  But the basic flow is this:  - Introduce my good guys.  In my case, I'm going to use a pair of siblings (more on this..) - Get them into bad trouble.  Introduce my bad guys. - They take off running to Mexico.   - Cat & Mouse my good guys and by bad guys through a bunch of trials - Resolve it at, beyond, or near the border.  I like this concept for a number of reasons:  it uses Texas front and center, because Mexico is the proverbial 'Garden of Eden' for any good get-away flick.  While it allows for a good range of characters, almost all of my scenes can be between two or three characters: the kids in a car, the bad guys after them, bill clinton & a prostitute, etc. (ok, maybe not the last one.)  When I need individuals for specific scenes, I'll be able to bring them in for an afternoon of filming and then either kill them off or move the story past them geographically.  This will make managing my cast a breeze.   And, lastly, I won't need any weird props; I can use things I have on-hand to bring down my production costs: my truck, my partner's gun, etc etc.  Next step is to start writing up the script.  (Actually, I've jumped the gun on this already since my last blog entry.  I'm already well into Act I, and have the outline for Act III pretty solid.)  Middle sections (Act II) are always the hardest for me.  In this case, my plan is just to keep up the pressure by throwing trials at my heroes at such an alarming rate that the audience doesn't have time to grow bored.  I can then mix in a few quiet moments of peace if I feel like the pace is too hectic.  I'd much rather come out the other end with pacing that is too frantic than a plot that is slow and boring.    Character wise, I'm leaning towards a central theme of sibling relationships; i.e. "how far would you go to protect your family?"  I'm going to echo this a couple times in the script, and from a character development standpoint, I'm going to go back and reemphasize my central ideas: character focus (on siblings), Texas focus (personalities), use what I've got handy (write for my cast.)  In other news, I found some digital snapshots from our last project, the 40's-style film noir detective piece that we did back in Febuary.  We still need a final re-cut on the thing; I haven't really had time to do it since editing seems to take extended periods of effort (whereas I can bang out a page or two of script with only 20 minutes of downtime.)  I'll see if I can post a few of these, though, in case anyone is interested in seeing what lighting setups were used to provide the look we achieved.  More soon..

      Hey folks,   Can't talk much today, as it's my wife & my first anniversary.  I think we're going to spend the day leisurely floating down the guadalupe river with a few friends.  As I sit back and drink my Tecate, I'll probably spend a fair chunk of my time just thinking of film ideas.  Here is the challenge I'm currently thinking over: what kind of feature can I make with the assets at hand, that would still be entertaining to watch, achievable on a very limited budget, and give me a wide swath of experience I can use on future projects?  I have an idea that is slowly incubating in my head, with a bit of spit & polish, I think it just might work.  My goals are simple:  1.  I want an idea set in Texas.  This makes locations simple.  Ideally, it would not only be "accidentally" set here, but focus on Texas, make it intregal to the story.  To people who don't live here, there is a hollywood view of Texas that can be an exotic place of burning deserts, sweeping mesas, etc.  I want to capitalize on this, because for a hollywood film it would jump the cost up to move the shoot here, but for me it's free.  2.  Plot needs to be carried by a small number of characters.  I don't want to have to organize and manage a dozen or more major characters in scenes together -- especially when I'm not going to pay them.  Ideally I will arrange it so that individual characters will only be needed for one day of shooting, so I can borrow people I know from local theater.  (I've got some friends who do Shakespear in the park every year, so I'll probably have to track them down.)  So I want a plot that: focuses on scenes of two or three people at a time, and allowing characters to drop in and out of the story.  3.  Since this is a learning experience more than a commercial product, I want my leads to be people I have access to all the time and can lean on heavily.  Sadly, this means that I'll have to write in parts for me, my wife, my business partner, my siblings.  (Oh, the horror.)  Is there anything worse than a movie where the director casts himself??  Well, yes, actually, there is -- the director who never learns his craft because he never gets around to starting a project.  So for this reason, I'm stepping over that dreaded line and casting people I know.  On the good side, I'm writing the script, so I'll just write parts that I know they'll be able to do.  Most of us have an acting background of some sort, anyway, so it probably won't be as bad as it could be.  4.  Use stuff I have around.  Use my truck, my wife's dad's ranch, my partner's 45.. basically I'm going to go around the house making notes of things I own, and write these into the script.  So thats my basic criteria.  Texas is a central character, small # of characters per scene, use people I have access to in roles written for them, write in stuff I own.  I actually have an idea for the skeleton of the story already, and I think it fits the above pretty well.  We'll save that for next time (oooh the suspense!).. but until then, time to hit the river.

      Ok, so I guess I will just get started.  So my goal is to jump into feature film.  I love to write, so my first asset (which I hope is actually solid, otherwise I'm pretty much screwed otherwise) is my ability to write.  I'm going to take a pragmatic approach to this, and try and rely on other people as little as possible.  That means my first step is going to be finding a story that will 1) be engaging and 2) actually be something I can tell without spending any real cash.  Let's talk about cash for a second.  Most filmmakers, I would imagine, probably find fundraising to be the hardest part of the process.  I don't think that's going to be accurate for me.  My business partner and I have actually raised a fair amount of money in the past.. probably upwards of $20 or $30 million bucks in the last ten years or so. (I know, wierd, huh?  Like I said, took a wrong turn at some point.  That doesn't mean I wasn't successful on the other road; it just means that it isn't where I want to be.)  Of course, I have never raised movie money (though I have heard that it's actually easy in some regards, because everyone in the world likes the idea of being involved in a movie.)  My problem is, if I were investing money MYSELF, I would never invest it in me.  That probably sounds strange, so let me explain.  I'm trying to look at this from an outsider's perspective.  Since I've invested in startups before, I know what kind of things I would look for prior to putting money into a deal.  Primarily, I would look at the people involved, the development and sales plan, and I would weigh the risks of getting my money back (hopefully with friends.)   In this case, I'm a filmmaker with one short film under my belt.  (More on that, later.)  I haven't won any awards, worked on any major productions, or produced any demonstrable product.  In spite of my obvious talent and winning personality, I wouldn't give me money to make a film.  It just doesn't make sense.  So looking at this realistically, I need to change that equation.  Raising money is never easy, but it comes down to a function of two basic things: quality of your package, and quantity of "at bats" (i.e. the number of times you step up to the plate and make a pitch.)  If you've got a 2% chance every time you make a pitch, then you'll need to pitch 50-100 people to get a "yes" or two.  Right now, my percentage chance is way too low.. so low, in fact, that I don't even want to start asking.  Which brings me back to my assets.  1.  Meager ability to write. 2.  Free time. (I'm not working right now.  Lord knows how long I can keep that up, but for now, its an asset.) 3.  Live in Texas.  Great locations (free via friend, family, or trespassing.) 4.  Own a Canon XL1s video camera, tripod, lenses, etc. 5.  Money for film & processing (if we go 16mm or Super16mm), some lights, etc. 6.  Nice PC with a firewire port.  With a lot of work, I can probably find a way to cook this thing into a editing station.  So that's my starting list.  Before I jump into a feature (the urge is almost overwhelming) I still feel like we need to learn quite a bit.  My thought on that was to do a couple more shortfilms between now and then, just to get a better foundation... if not, then we'll do the first feature itself as a "Test Film", mostly for experience and realizing the whole time that the final product won't be worth watching.  That's probably enough for now.  I have some more ideas for my getting started plan, but I'm going to take this afternoon to go scout a location for one of the aforementioned short films.  (I did a similar shoot down to Hondo, Texas last weekend with great results.)  More on both of these points, later.

      First post.  Cool.  I don't know if anyone will ever read this or not, but I decided to start keeping a running log after reading the book  Rebel Without a Crew  by Robert Rodriguez.  I'd actually read this book before, a long (long) time ago, but decided to read it again recently as I start getting back into film.  As a kid, film was all I ever wanted to do.  Growing up in a small town, there was only one theater I could go to, which was (quite literally) right in the middle of town square.  The old guy in the projection booth took a liking to me, and he would let me collect the strips of film that result everytime he had to do a makeshift splice.  After I'd been showing up for a year or two, he gave me an old film splicer from the early 1900s and before long I was slicing together bits and pieces of completely unrelated movies.. cutting and rearranging a frankenstein-like beast of 35mm pratfalls, action scenes, and unconnected dialogue.  Somewhere along the way, I took a turn away from film, and I've never quite forgiven myself for it.  I've seen success in other areas -- but I can feel the dream slipping away from me.  If I don't start pushing now -- and pushing HARD -- this story will end up being a "what could have been" tale.. and, honestly, I'm not a big fan of those.  So here is my plan, for whatever it's worth:  I'm going to try and document my process here, start to finish.  The places I go, the decisions I make, the things I learn.  I'm going to take some ideas through the cycle of concept->development->production->pitch, and see what happens.  If nothing else, even if it doesn't work, I'll have a nice running narrative of the process along the way, and maybe someone out there reading this will pick up a few helpful hints or learn from my mistakes.  I'm also not going to promise to keep this log running indefinately.  I reserve the right to drop it, flake out, or just put it on the sidelines for any particular length of time.  If major things happen (fingers crossed on that one, eh?) then I'll try and be sure to post them.  I will say that I tend to be rather prolific in my writing, so hopefully keeping this thing current won't be a problem.  I suppose we will see.

      Oh yeah -- I almost forgot: my re-edit ('string out') of Casework actually turned out pretty well.  I cut a new set of narration in my closet using my Canon XL1s, so the voice doesn't match (my voice sounds nothing like our lead actors) but it worked pretty well from a pacing perspective.  Overall it was a great exercise, and I know Premiere significantly better than I did a week ago.  To actually complete this version would would be a hell of a lot of work, though, and I don't own the sound effects so it would probably cost me some cash.  So instead I've decided to set it aside side for a bit and spend my time reading and researching (see previous post.)  Oh yeah, I also filed three of my treatments today with the Writer's Guild.  They aren't ready to be copywrited (copywritten?  copywrittled?) yet, but I figure a WGA registration is better than nothing.

      Haven't posted much in the last few days, because what I'm working on isn't the most exciting thing in the world: I'm studying my ass off.  Not in the traditional sense, but in the cinematic sense.  There was a line in Rodriquez' film book that I think of quite a bit -- I'm not going to go back and quote it, so lets just pretend I'm quoting it correctly -- something to the effect of "If you want to be a Rock Star, you don't go off to Rock Star school.  You sit in your garage and you practice until your fingers bleed.  Film is no different."  I like this quote, and I think he is probably right.  The great thing about Casework was this: I know, now, that with a solid amount of effort and proper budgeting, we can nail production value.  Cinematography, lighting, sets, costumes.. these things are complicated, but if you hire great people, things will generally work out.  Seems kind of obvious, I know, but when you've never seen the process work end-to-end it seems kind of blackbox.. like some kind of magic, bunny-producing hat.  Lesson #1: it isn't.  Lesson #2, also important, was that my pre-production efforts could have been focused a lot better.  Next time I think I'll do a much, much better job.  So anyway, back to the bleeding fingers: I've started watching my favorite films without sound, and making notes throughout about the sequences they've put together.  Most of the time I just cover the high level sequence (such as, in Evil Dead, a sequence might be: "Ash comes down the stairs into the cellar, looks around, very creepy.  Goes to door, opens it reluctantly.  Scott jumps out and scares him." followed by "Scott and Ash rifle the desk, find the dagger and the book of the dead.")  Generally I'm trying to get a feeling for the pacing of the films as a whole, making general notes about the sequences and only stopping to look at the shot makeups of particular sequences that seem different or interesting.  As I said, not too exciting -- in fact, when I told my wife about this blog, she told me that it sounded boring.  Sadly, she's right.  None the less, it's a great way for me to keep a log.    I spent the rest of the day today reading a bunch of material on lighting and photography -- I'm weak in this area, but seem to pick up new technologies pretty quickly, cross my fingers, so we'll see.  I've got an old Canon AE1-P that I borrowed from my father years ago and forgot to return.  I plan to start testing exposures and learning the wonderful world of f-stops in my rapidly disappearing freetime.  I also went through all of the used 16mm equipment on ebay, trying to puzzle out which camera I should buy.  Not that I'm in a particular hurry to spend more money, but I think a 16mm will be handy once my fingers stop bleeding.

      Been away for a while, working on fun and not-so-fun stuff, thought I would drop off a quick update.  As I think I mentioned in a previous entry, back in Febuary J and I shot a super 16mm short film called 'Casework'.  The idea was to do a 40s-style Sam Spade detective piece, shoot it all in one office, and have a bit of fun with it.  At some point I'll go into the details a bit of how we put the production together, and I think I even have some snapshots we took of the office before-during-after shooting.  The production itself was a 2-day shoot, the result of which is about 5 rolls of s16 film that we've had processed and colored ('best light', they call it) by Filmworker's Club up in Dallas.  The original piece was a comedy short, sort of a 40s era spoof.  To be honest, I have mixed feelings about the result -- the production value was spot-on, IMO, but the pacing is off and, as a result, the humor suffers.  I've got an editing suite and a pretty butch computer, though, so all this footage provides me with a great opportunity to practice my editing skills.  Since much of the piece is voiceover anyway, I'm going to practice editing by doing something pretty challenging: I'm going to cut an entirely different story using the exact same shots.  Strange, I know, but I figure if I can start to do stuff like that it will help hone skills that will come in handy when I look up to find myself in a bind later.  I can imagine the "how the hell do I make a conherent scene out of this crap?" question comes up a lot in editing, even if you do a lot of homework on the front end (which we did.)  Well it looks like my batch import is done, so I guess I'll get back to it.
