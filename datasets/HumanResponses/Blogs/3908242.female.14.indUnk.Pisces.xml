      The thing I was most amazed by was the dammage caused by the recent landslide from the earthquakes in San Salvador. The ground had been rattled, houses tumbled down, and people became homeless. So many of the people I saw were making houses out of cardboard boxes. There was a bare mountain side just across the dusty road, and there were roofs sticking out of the mud below it. The people living there had had houses out of mud and crumbeling brick, which did not withstand the earthquake.  Seeing this astonished me. I couldn't begin to imaginehow painfull it must have been to watch your house and loved ones get swallowed up by the mud. I had to turn away. On the other side of the road were others who had lost their homes. They were trying to reconstuct the damaged areas. Most of them were living and sleeping outside. I wanted so badly to get out of the bus and help them; help them rebuild their lost homes, help them make dinner, and most of all to be their friends. They just seemed horified by the disaster, and like they wanted to escape, to have a welcoming house, to play in their yards again, they seemed to want to be free from re-building their lives.

      the bucket will hang, the handle perched on a branch, silver gleaming, swaying gently--  a rod stuck into the tree; a passageway for the lathargic liquid --  the golden, sticky, thick, sap dripping down to soon be turned into maple syrup--  a bucket swaying gently, beneath the branch, catching the blood of the tree--  wooden slats made from maple- fifteen around in a circle--  a tin belt holds the bucket together; it makes a clink-clank sound as is lightly bumps the tree--  a spigot inhales the syrup that drips through it's mouth--  and everything rests on the hard, wooden bottom....

      Well, I actually have no memory of when I was ten, so for this excersise we can pretend that my birthday is in June, and that at the time of my trip to El Salador, I was ten. But  that's alright because you can never really leave that tenth year of your life: end of the first decade, double digit ages, the many wonders of outdoors, and laser-like ambitions.  I very well could have been ten, for my amazement of the vast new world was very similar to that of a younger child discovering ice cream for the first time.   When I want to El Salvador, the first amazing thing was the heat. It was in the begining of May, but the temperature was unberable, for me. For everyone who had lived there, the heat was normal. The palm trees were the second amazing discovery I made. Among many other amazing things I saw and expirienced were landslids from recent earthquakes, a first communion, wave hopping in the ocean, and pupusas.        The thing I was most amazed by was the dammage caused by the recent landslide from the earthquakes. The ground had been rattled, houses tumbled down, and people became homeless. So many of the people I saw were making houses out of cardboard boxes. There was a bare mountain side just across the dusty road, and there were roofs sticking out of the mud below it. The people living there had had houses out of mud and crumbeling brick, which did not withstand the earthquake.  Seeing this astonished me.

      Fast! Is how I'm supposed to be typing, but I'm not. Not at all. Because I can not think of any words to write.
