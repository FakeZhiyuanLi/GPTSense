        An elderly man recently diagnosed with a brain tumor leaped to his death from a vintage airplane he rented to celebrate his 88th birthday, officials said Tuesday.  Joseph Harold Frost took off his safety belt at 300 to 400 feet, stood up in the open cockpit of the two-seat biplane and went over the side Monday.  The pilot tried but failed to wrestle him back into the plane and nose the aircraft upward to force Frost back into his seat.  "I think that was Dad's idea, to go out in a flash of glory," said Robert Frost, who had helped his father arrange the chartered flight on a biplane similar to the ones the elder Frost flew in World War II.  The man landed on an apartment patio, horrifying those who witnessed it.  "I saw him hit the power lines, heard trees breaking. I really thought it wasn't real," Cynthia Lankford said. Um, ya think? Most people who see a man falling from the sky would probably be in a state of shock and not think it's real. But I bet the people who had to clean up their patio thought it was pretty damn real.  So, this begs the question. Now, I know that no one WANTS to die, but it's pretty apparent that we all will perish (unless your kids cryogenically preserve you). So, with that I ask, what is the best way to die???

        Three things that we can undoubtedly count on.  Can anyone fully appreciate how good Mike Krzyzewski really is?? Does anyone really know how to spell Krzyzewski?  This man has quickly become a living basketball legend -- 10 Final Fours, 10-1 in regional finals -- That is almost, just almost, right on par with Wooden's 10 national titles in 12 years.  Well, the Final Four is set. I admit, I threw my bracket out after the second day of the tourney. All that being said, I am proud that I put 3 of the 4 in the Final Four. I had UConn, Oklahoma St., Duke, and Kentucky. That sounds decent, right? However, I had Kentucky winning it all, which was just dumb. Should have known they'd stumble. Actually, they probably would have won it all if I wouldn't have picked them. Seems that the "Strup Curse" strikes again. Damn it. I'm starting to root for the Yankees.  The lines are set for Saturday's games. Money will be flyin' around, people betting their lives on college athletes. It truly is a problem in the US, but I can't really denounce it. God knows I have been willing to put a buck or two on a game before, and if I had any money at all right now, I would be droppin' bills on the Final Four.   My picks? Well, knowing that Oklahoma St is favored by five and UConn is favored by two, I like the Underdogs. Duke as an Underdog is never a good thing. That being said, my final picks are Duke and Oklahoma St. Meaning that if UConn wins by less than two and Oklahoma St. wins by more than 5, I am a winner. We'll just have to wait and see.   Remember my inklings in my first column "Sports, Spirits & High Stakes." Here it is, and I quote "This much I do know. . . Stanford will not win it all. St. Joe's will not win it all. But, someone who is ranked in the top 6 in the final regular season poll will win it all. That should leave you only a few teams to choose from. Good luck. You heard it here first."  Depending on which final poll you look at, this makes me look like a pure genius. Knowing that the RPI is the most-favored final regular season poll, here's the final top 5.  Duke, St. Joes, Oklahoma St., UConn, Kentucky.  Looks like I hit that one on the head, assuming Georgia Tech doesn't ruin it for me. . . After all I have said here, if you're a bettin' man, you know damn well to go put $20 on G-Tech. Everyone else will fall at the hands of the "Strup Curse. . . "

       urlLink At least 82 women were secretly videotaped naked  or partly undressed while applying for jobs at a Los Angeles-area Hooters restaurant and changing into the chain's distinctive uniform, police said on Thursday.   Detectives in the Los Angeles suburb of West Covina were interviewing the women, who range in age from 17 to 25, after seizing 180 video files from the personal computer of former Hooters manager Juan Aponte, police spokesman Rudy Lopez said.    "The videos were of the women changing into and out of the Hooters uniform," Lopez said, and were taken while they applied for a job at the restaurant, which is scheduled to open in April, at a trailer on the construction site.   At the interview they were told to change into the uniform of bright orange shorts and a white tank-top bearing the Hooters logo and were surreptitiously videotaped, he said.   "We're taking photographs of the girls in the videotapes and comparing them with the applications and that's who we're trying to contact," Lopez said, adding that while more than 1,200 women had applied it appeared that not all were taped.   "They are appalled," Lopez said of the victims. "They are angry, upset, emotional and had absolutely no knowledge this had taken place."  Not much I can say without getting myself into trouble. This guy really had this whole interview process thing figured out.  Apparently the ladies he interviewed didn't think twice about "modeling" the uniform for their interview.  Makes you wonder. . .

        Exercise guru Richard Simmons allegedly slapped a man who made a sarcastic remark about one of his videos, police said.   Simmons, known for his ``Sweatin' to the Oldies'' series of exercise videos set to songs from the 1950s and 60s, was cited for misdemeanor assault.   A fellow passenger recognized Simmons on Wednesday night at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport as he was waiting for a flight to Los Angeles, police said.   The man ``made the off-hand comment, 'Hey everybody. It's Richard Simmons. Let's drop our bags and rock to the '50s,''' said Phoenix police Sgt. Tom Osborne. ``Mr. Simmons took exception to it and walked over to the other passenger and apparently slapped him in the face.''    The passenger, whose identity wasn't immediately available, wasn't injured but told police that he intended to file charges against Simmons, 55.    Osborne said Simmons was cited for misdemeanor assault and permitted to board his flight.   You go boy!!! I always knew Richard would have that bitch-slap perfected. Come to find out, poor, old Richard slapped my brother, allegedly because he grabbed Richard's ass.  Always wondered why Shane was constantly watching Richard's tapes. . .

         For those of you that live in the Midwest, and particularly Indianapolis, let it be known that it is likely we'll have one more bout with Old Man Winter.  According to the Old Farmer's Almanac, it says that for the days including April 1-6 - "Turning cold, rain to snow.  The heaviest snowfalls will occur early and late in the season, a few days before Thanksgiving, and in early April."  It seems as if we are in for a little more of the white stuff.  So, if you are like me and thought that this warmer weather would bring the end of winter, think again. Seems as if we'll have to deal with this snow BS one more time.    I honestly hope Old Man Winter comes back, just so I can kick him in the balls.  For those of you who won't be experiencing any more snow this season, F*#k Off.  We don't care about your "perfect" weather.

      Ok people, I realize that the name of the column is “Sports, Spirits & High Stakes”; however, with the weather turning warmer and the smell of spring in the air, I must devote this column to one thing, and one thing only. . . No, it’s not sex.  It’s baseball.  And for all of you readers out there that don’t like baseball and want to stop reading, screw you.  Give baseball a chance.  And if you do stop reading after this sentence, screw you again.  Baseball has headlined the daily news for the past few months.  With everything from blockbuster trades to steroid use allegations.  And this was all before pitchers and catchers even reported.  All I can say is that I am stoked for the baseball season, because with so many off-season headlines, this season is bound to be a Deusey (for those of you who don’t know the origin of the word “deusey,” it comes from the word Deusenberg, which is an antique car that was once considered the Rolls-Royce of the early 20th Century).  Needless to say, this season should be great.  For those of you who didn’t spend the winter on Mars, most of you know that Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod) was traded to the much HATED Yankees for not much more than a Pinto and a bag of chips.  No need to discuss that sore subject.  Furthermore, most have heard of the allegations of extensive steroid use throughout the league, particularly against Barry Bonds.  Sorry, but a middle-aged man doesn’t swell up like an erection just by working out a lot.  Really, there’s no need to discuss that either.  So, with those things out of the way, we can move on to the important things, like:   The Vet .  Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia.  The former home of the MLB’s Philadelphia Phillies.  Never been there, but my connections tell me it was the worst stadium in sports history.  Personally, I won’t miss it.  I know that some have said they will.  But, for most, it was by God’s good blessing that the Vet was destroyed and a new stadium was built.  Veterans Stadium was reduced to a pile of rubble in just more than a minute this past Sunday as hundreds of people gathered to watch the demolition.  About 3,000 pounds of explosives took down the old concrete home of the Philadelphia Phillies and Eagles, section by section in a clockwise direction as loud booms rang out.  “Ladies and gentlemen, you just witnessed history," team announcer Dan Baker told the cheering crowd of several hundred people. One onlooker played Taps on a silver trumpet to mark the occasion.  One baseball player, whom I happen to know, used to play for the Phillies.  He was said of the stadium, “playing in the Vet is like playing baseball in hell on concrete. It sucks. We used to look forward to road trips.”  I will protect that player’s identity, however, I believe that’s ‘nough said.    Mark Prior .  According to recent reports, Mark Prior, the man, will start the season on the 15-day Disabled List (DL) due to inflammation in his right Achilles’ tendon.  If Prior doesn't pitch in any major league exhibition games, he would be eligible to come off the disabled list on April 10. The Cubs hope to have him for their first homestand April 12-19.  Most of you probably think this is a huge loss.  And it is, to an extent.  However, we all know that SPRING TRAINING DOES NOT MATTER A LICK come Opening Day, and thus his not pitching now isn’t that big of a deal.  It could end up being bad because it will take him longer to get into the swing of things.  However, it may be a blessing in the long run, because he may not be as fatigued at the end of the season.  We’ll see. One thing is for sure, the Cubs will play a World Series game this year.  Unless injuries rip them apart.  And losing Prior for more than a few weeks would certainly set them back on their World Series mission.      Wrigley Field .  What a gem.  However, it hasn’t gone without debate.  In February, the Cubs and rooftop business owners signed a deal stemming from a dispute that started when the Cubs began arguing with the rooftop owners over plans to expand the stadium, with the rooftop owners fearing their views would be obstructed. In December 2002, the Cubs sued the rooftop owners, accusing them of stealing the team's product, copyright infringement and unjust enrichment at the Cubs' expense.  Thus the deal was done.  The rooftop business owners agreed to pay the team about 17 percent of their revenue -- expected to bring the Cubs between $1.2 million to $1.7 million a year. The 20-year agreement also includes provisions for the owners to be reimbursed if their views are hindered by ballpark alterations, including a proposed expansion of Wrigley's bleachers.  Nevertheless, one business owner refuses to pay.  Skybox on Waveland.  Skybox's attorney Chris Gair says the 125-seat rooftop will "never pay anything" to the Cubs.  So, the Cubs have decided to block the view of Wrigley Field from the only rooftop that has not agreed to share revenues with the team.  Not sure how they will do this, but good for the Cubs.  Wrigleyville is a Mecca, and to own property there is a privilege.  The property there wouldn’t be worth dick if it wasn’t for Wrigley Field and the Cubs.  Show some love people.  They should just be glad they’ve been allowed to watch the games for free for this long.  The fans will show hatred toward that business, believe me. And once that happens, I’m willing to bet this business breaks down strikes a deal with the Cubs.  Bunch of friggin’ idiots.   As you can see, I love the Cubs. I will see them play this year on a few different occasions. Attending a day game at Wrigley Field is one thing that can instantly bring a smile to my face (no need to discuss the others at this point).  If you have yet to see a game at Wrigley, do it before you die.  If you don’t like the Cubs, fuck off.  And finally, if you thought this column was long, winded, and boring, kiss my ass.  Hope to see you all back here tomorrow.   Oh, btw,  urlLink here’s  a great story about a guy who went to a spring training game and tried to eat 9 hotdogs and drink 9 beers all in 9 innings.  Sounds like a great idea to me.  I think I have a new milestone to accomplish the next time my brother and I go to a baseball game.  In case you don’t read the article, just know that this guy was Charlie the Cubs Fan.  A true legend indeed.

        The  urlLink average price of gasoline at the pump has hit a record high  of $1.738 a regular self-serve gallon, according to the Automobile Association of America.   The record high on AAA's daily Fuel Gauge Report surpasses the previous record, $1.737, hit last August. The average climbed 0.7 cent overnight.   California leads the nation at $2.141 a gallon for regular gas, followed by Hawaii at $2.111 and Nevada at $2.057. Those looking for cheap gas might stop in Oklahoma for fuel at $1.604 a gallon, Georgia at $1.607 and South Carolina also at $1.607 a gallon.   Ok, you all know that cow farts are methane. I couldn't fool you geniuses. However, there has to be something we can do here. These prices are outrageous. Experts predict that prices will climb even higher with warmer weather around the corner. Two dollars a gallon? Makes me want my bus pass back. Or a new pair of Nikes.   We really need to do something about this OPEC guy. Why don't Bush and Kerry stop bitching about each other and start bitching about gas prices? Probably because neither one of them has driven this century. Whoever has the best plan to lower gas prices gets my vote. Gas prices are the bottom line in this year's election. You heard it here first.   urlLink Here's  a state by state list of gas prices. . .

        Hotel heiress and reality TV star Paris Hilton was thrown from a horse Friday during production of a sequel to the hit Fox series "The Simple Life" and was airlifted to a hospital on Florida's Gulf Coast, producers said.   Hilton, 23, "did not sustain any major injuries" and was later released from the hospital in Tampa where she had been taken for observation, according to a statement from 20th Century Fox Television.   A spokesman for the TV studio, Chris Alexander, said Hilton was walking around after falling off the horse, "but to err on the absolute side of caution, we made a decision to medevac her" to a hospital.   Haven't seen the video personally, but have heard that she really didn't have much of a problem staying on THAT horse. She was probably on her cellphone when the accident happened. She can't seem to master talking and riding at the same time. . .

        As a five-decade livestock producer, Jim Farmer wants his son and two daughters to follow in his footsteps.  He hopes ready-to-eat beef -- in a can -- is the ticket.  Farmer has joined resources with about three dozen other beef producers, including his son and son-in-law, in creating a co-op that aims to turn 1,000 cattle a year into canned beef. Eventually, the co-op hopes to handle as much as 10 times that.  The specially built plant in Montgomery City, about 70 miles west of St. Louis, has begun production. Canned beef has hit the shelves in some Missouri stores, mostly in tiny towns. While it's too early to say what the demand is, farmers like Farmer are thinking big.  "Our goal is to make an opportunity in agriculture for all of my descendants, if they choose," said Farmer, 64. "Something like this could help make that happen."  Does this guy really think that beef in a can is his children's ticket to riches? I realize that farmers have been having difficult times as of late, but come on? I guess I should just shut up, because I am sure that everyone was laughing at the guy that thought of putting ham in a can.   I do not like it Sam-I-Am, I do not like green ham in a can.    urlLink Here's  the whole story, for your viewing pleasure.

      Ok, sorry for the delay kids. I must let you know that I have been overcome with an extremely indefensible virus with symptoms similar to malaria. Should have stayed in the US. Today is our first day back from Spring Break, and I was fortunate enough to get away for a bit. Went on a trip to Africa, Botswana more specifically. Stayed in a small fort village known as Wayne. It was rather fascinating. However, without an internet connection, it was hard for me to keep up with the blog. I was on vacation, so quitcherbitchin'.  Everything will be back on track by the end of the day. Don't have anything else to do in class.

        KEY WEST, Fla. - Like Superman emerging from a phone booth, Armando Parra steps out from the bathroom of his old-time barbershop transformed into the Chicken Catcher, dedicated to ridding this island town of nuisance fowl.  To some, Parra is a hero clearing out the birds that tear up lawns, sneak inside houses to perch in Christmas trees and leave a carpet of droppings in their wake. To others, he’s a villain, snatching beloved roosters and speckled hens from neighborhood streets where they delight tourists and residents alike.  Wearing shorts and a mostly unbuttoned shirt emblazoned with “Key West Chicken Catcher,” the 63-year-old Parra climbed into his two-tone blue van and started another patrol one recent afternoon.  Parra has snared more than 90 chickens in the few weeks since he became the first official chicken catcher in Key West, where colorful chickens dart through traffic on busy streets, meander in mangroves and even greet customers at the drive-thru of the KFC.   urlLink This  article is hilarious. It's gotta be a hoax or something.  If not, then I think my brother has found his true calling, right bro? I heard SD might need a Chicken Catcher. Maybe you and Armando can start a trans-continental business together. . .

      A factory worker who claimed his lungs were ruined as result of mixing flavoring oils used in microwave popcorn was awarded $20 million by a jury Monday.  Eric Peoples was the first of 30 former workers at the Gilster-Mary Lee Corp. plant in Jasper to have his suit heard against the two makers of the butter flavoring.   Following a morning of closing arguments, the jury deliberated for a little more than three hours before returning the verdict.  People cried and hugged his wife, Cassandra, as the jury ruled against International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. and its subsidiary Bush Boake Allen Inc., the manufacturers of the flavoring.   They were ordered to pay $18 million to Eric Peoples and $2 million to his wife for compensatory personal injury damages. No punitive damages were awarded.  The attorneys for the manufacturers left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.  This is totally ridiculous. Just goes to show that anyone can sue anyone else and get PAID. Wonder if I can sue my work for providing our staff with candy and snacks at a reduced price? My waist has certainly grown and that has definitely had an effect on my modeling career. Is that a tort claim? Loss of financial possibility? Where's a good lawyer when you need one???

        I apologize about the hiatus people. However, I feel that it is justified, seeing how I am on Spring Break (more like Winter Break around here). Here's what I woke up to this morning:  Heavy Snow Warning remains in effect until 12 PM EST this afternoon...   Snow will be heavy at times this morning. By noon... 3 to 6 inches of snow will accumulate. Some drifting snow is likely later in the morning. Travel on untreated roads will become difficult.   Any travel is strongly discouraged. If you leave the safety of being indoors... you are putting your life at risk.   I went out on a limb and left the house. Made it to work. Had to really, because they weren't buying the "car buried in snow" routine. Well, they will certainly buy the "sicker than a dog as a result of the hilariously fickle weather gods" routine once the end of the week rolls around.  Still, when the weather is involved, the joke's on me. . .

        A woman whose family became ill after possible exposure to hepatitis A at a Taco Bell sued the restaurant and its parent company Thursday.  The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, accuses the restaurant of negligence and argues that it failed to take reasonable precautions to prevent an infected worker from spreading the disease.  Thousands of people who ate at the Taco Bell in Derry between February 7 and February 21 were warned to watch for symptoms after a worker was diagnosed with the disease. State health officials said the case appeared to be isolated but offered injections of immune globulin as a precaution.  Maybe Taco Bell needs to reconsider it's human resource policies.  If an employee with hepatitis can't even get the day off. . . what's next? "Employee Confesses to Defecating In Customer's Lunch"  Wait, that may have already happened. . .

        The Alan Benes Comeback Train may be switching from an express to a local for the time being. Benes suffered a strained oblique muscle in a batting drill Thursday and could have his scheduled Friday start pushed back.   Manager Tony La Russa revealed the injury in his pregame briefing Thursday morning, and trainer Barry Weinberg confirmed it after the Redbirds 13-8 win over the Dodgers at Holman Stadium. Benes has been slowed for the last several years by shoulder troubles, but he has impressed the team's staff in the early going this spring.   I realize that no one but Shane and I care about the Benes family, but this just proves my previous post that Alan Benes SUCKS. This guy is making at least $300,000 for being nothing more than a skid mark on Tony LaRussa's underwear. That pisses me off. . . mainly because I'm broke. So here's to Alan Benes and the rest of his shitty baseball family. . . A BIG F-U. Maybe it's time to retire. . .

      Martha Stewart was convicted on Friday of all four charges against her, including perjury and obstruction of justice. She could be sentenced to five years in prison on each count according to the law, but that's unlikely. Still, she may very well have to do time. Shares of her eponymous company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia were halted briefly, then resumed trading.  If the appeals process fails to work in her favor, we suggest she take a page from her pal Samuel Waksal's playbook. After his conviction, the former ImClone Systems chief executive requested to serve his seven-year sentence at federal prison camp Eglin in Florida. That joint was considered so cushy that the term "Club Fed" was coined to describe it, and we recently ranked it as one of five best places to go to prison.

Almost makes you want to be a millionaire criminal, hey???

      The Indianapolis Ice turned to former Olympic figure skater and reputed "bad girl" Tonya Harding to sell tickets, not play hockey.  A general announcement that the Ice had signed Harding to a contract prompted a ratings-crazed sports talk nation to speculate that she was suiting up for the Central Hockey League team against Colorado on Friday at Pepsi Coliseum. ESPN and other national TV and radio talk shows were abuzz earlier this week.  Harding, however, is not playing hockey. She is scheduled to sign autographs as part of a "Guaranteed Fight Night" promotion, and the part-time boxer will spar with a local celebrity yet to be named.  Gee, I was really hoping that she would lace 'em up and take one for the team.  Of course, she'd probably spend most of her time in the penalty box. Oh well, at least there will be chicks boxing. . .

        The best place to live in the world is Zurich, Switzerland, according to a quality-of-life survey conducted by Mercer Human Resource Consulting.   Zurich was crowned No. 1 for the second year running based on 39 criteria that included a variety of political, social, and economic factors such as the quality of health, education, and transportation services. Of the world's top 30 cities, 17 are in Europe.    urlLink Here's  the scoop.   Guess this is the reassurance I needed to know that Indianapolis wasn't in the Top 10. Maybe next year Indy!!

      It will be awhile before Steve Moore gets back on the ice for the Colorado Avalanche. Todd Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks might have to wait just as long.  Moore will miss the rest of the season with a broken neck, the result of a sucker punch from Bertuzzi. Moore also sustained a concussion and deep facial cuts, and he will remain hospitalized in Vancouver indefinitely. Police are investigating the situation.  urlLink Here's  the full story.  Bertuzzi's cheap-shot sucker punch from behind on Colorado's Steve Moore on Monday night in Vancouver, and then his driving of Moore's head into the ice, was despicable and indefensible. Hopefully there will be criminal charges filed against Bertuzzi and the league sends a loud message that this type of behavior will not be tolerated.  The fan interest in hockey is fading fast, and this unexplainable criminal act makes it that much more unappealing.

      The Indianapolis Ice announced today that it has reached an agreement with former figure skating champion, Tonya Harding. Harding will join the Indianapolis Ice as the team takes on the Colorado Eagles this Friday (March 12th) at 7:00 p.m. from the Pepsi Coliseum. Click  urlLink here  to read the release from the Indy Ice website.  Apparently Tonya wants to get in on some more ass-kicking action.

      After looking outside and realizing that it was snowing (God I Love IN), I decided it best to look for cheerful pictures of paradise on the internet, rather than to sob uncontrollably.  Am I the only one who NEEDS warm weather, and is willing to to just about anything to get it at this point??? Next week is Spring Break, but my bank account has gotten the better of me and I am not longer able to make my permanent relocation to Bora Bora.  Instead, I am stuck here, working and shivering.   Come to think of it, it's not that bad.  Last year for Spring Break, I only went to Arizona. It was nice, but come on, who needs 85 and sunny everyday anyways. . .   I do.  Let the sobbing commence.

      We've all been there: sitting in a casino, throwing good money after bad, trying to beat the odds at a blackjack table. It's small consolation that everybody else is getting massacred as well. Or almost everybody else. One guy hunches quietly in a corner seat, observing everything with an air of snooty detachment. He's scoring 17s, 21s, 19s, getting all the right cards, hitting with uncanny accuracy, and raising his bets at precisely the opportune moments. You and the others double down with 11s only to get dealt fives. You hit with 15s or 16s and draw picture cards. Once-handsome skyscrapers of chips slowly disintegrate into shabby little hovels of $1 and $5 disks.  Something is obviously wrong here, and you can't blame it all on rotten luck.  Everyone's got a buddy or an Uncle with winning gambling strategies,  urlLink here   are some that actually work.

         Alright Folks, it's time for a little fan involvement.  The game is simple. Think of the best quote you can for the picture above, and submit it to me via the comments link listed below.  Best Quote wins.    You are probably wondering what you win. Who cares what you win, won't it be nice just knowing you are the winner??? So, give it your best shot. You may enter more than once. And Shane, you might as well stop now. You won't win.   (For those of you that don't know, the picture is of Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra, both shortstops, one for the Yankees and one for the Red Sox. A very heated rivalry, to say the least.)

      Well ladies and gentlemen, it's finally here. The long-awaited premiere of my soon-to-be famous weekly column, "Sports, Spirits, & High Stakes." So much to talk about.  Lets skip the mushy introduction and get right to it.  I'll pick 5 topics to discuss, and please feel free to make comments on any of the discussed topics (and anything else for that matter).   (1)	The Sopranos Premiere -- So, like the millions of other fans around the country, I settled into the couch and caught the season premiere of the Sopranos.  Wow. I was truly excited about the new season. And I am not your average fan, mind you. I have a book on the history of the Sopranos. I have the cookbook. I have Sopranos trinkets. Oh yeah, big fan.  At any rate, I was somewhat disappointed with the premiere, but was glad to see that someone got WHACKED. I think they set the season up well, and I predict some major changes within the family will be forthcoming.  Tony and Carmela will get back together. Paulie will always win the battle with Christopher. Quit being a bitch and pay your dues Chrissy Whissy. I am predicting right now that Christopher will be the fall of the Soprano family.  Some how. Some way. Just remember, you heard it here first.  (2)	March Madness Heats Up -- It's about that time folks, Cinderella is putting on her dress and getting ready to go dancing.  Stanford loses. St Joe's wins and goes undefeated.  Liberty, East Tennessee State, Murray State, Central Florida and Princeton all clinched NCAA Tournament bids on Saturday. Four more mid-major title games are slated for Monday. And by the end of the week, all 31 conference champions will be decided. This is an exciting time of year.  Place your bets kids.  More people will bet their house's mortgage on college basketball than all other sports combined. Why not get in on the action??? Click  urlLink here  to see the current odds on winning the tournament.  This much I do know. . . Stanford will not win it all.  St. Joe's will not win it all. But, someone who is ranked in the top 6 in the final regular season poll will win it all.  That should leave you only a few teams to choose from. Good luck. You heard it here first. (3)	MLB Spring Training -- Baseball is back in full swing.  Some people argue that the baseball season is too long.  To those people I say "screw you."  In what other sport can you go to a game at both the beginning and the end of the season, and have a chance to freeze your ass off? None. At least not in American. It's finally a good time to be a Cubs fan. All those years that my grandpa rooted for them and they didn't win shit. I am sure that he and Harry Carey got sloshed last year when the Cubbies were in the NLCS. Couple of drunks in heaven. Happy as could be. Wonder what a bar in heaven is like. . . Prediction # 3. . . Cubs vs. Red Sox in the World Series.  Assuming both teams stay healthy.  Again, you heard it here first. (4)	Law School Prom -- The defining ingredient to all law school functions is alcohol.  While not all law students drink, the majority of them do.  And while we are learning the ins and outs of the legal system, many of us are out there breaking the laws which we may someday forced to defend.  I know this isn't a perfect world, but it seems as if this whole idea is ass backwards.  God knows that I have broken the law and that I don't often play by the rules, but it seems somewhat odd that law school functions are characterized by the amount of alcohol consumed.  Oh shit, who am I kidding.  I am a lush just like the rest of my colleagues!!! Bottoms up legal scholars!!!   (5)	Martha Found Guilty -- God, I was so glad to hear this.  For once, money can't buy a celebrity out of their illegal activity.  She did break the law.  And now, she will pay for it.  All for $51,000.  That's like 51 cents to you and I. Are you kidding me? The worst part about it is that she will probably get less than two years jail time in a facility that is nicer than most of our homes.  The federal prison that she will likely go to will be the one that Pete Rose went to, and he was quoted as saying that his time in jail was more like a vacation than incarceration.  Hopefully people will stop buying her shit and make her realize that her mistake was worth more than $51K and some time in a minimum-security resort.

        If you don't have more than one tour of duty with the Cardinals, you're not a true Benes. Like his brother Andy before him, Alan Benes has returned to the organization where he had the most success. Here's the full  urlLink schpeal .  For those of you that don't know baseball, the Benes family has been pitching in the majors since Babe Ruth came into the league.  We were  unfortunate  enough to see Alan Benes pitch last year in Spring Training with the Cubs, and the only person who may be a worse pitcher than Alan is his brother Andy. These guys are terrible. Looks like another year of AA ball for Alan.   Come to think of it, this guy kind of looks like my brother. Both of them pitch like sissies, I can tell you that.

        Martha Stewart is scheduled to appear at the probation office Monday for a sentencing hearing after having been convicted on four counts of obstructing justice and lying to investigators about a well-timed stock sale.  Sentencing in the case is scheduled June 17, with legal experts saying Stewart will likely draw somewhere between one and two years prison time -- nothing close to the maximum 20 years.  All this bullshit to save herself $51,000. Wow. The life of a Cajillionaire. Apparently she wasn't thinking about the millions she'll lose while she's in jail. . . DOH!!

      It's that time of year again folks, March Madness is  urlLink here .  Stanford seemed to have fate on their side, making a run at an undefeated season, but their luck ran out at Washington in their final game of the regular season.  On the other hand, some teams like Duke, St. Joe's, and Kentucky continue to roll in preparation for Championship Week.   Who will be dancing come next Thursday?? We'll soon find out. ESPN is the place to be this week, with 31 conference championships aired over the span of one week.  All this hoops hoopla should make for a great weekend.  And when it's all said and done, I know these two things are true. . . (1) my Butler Bulldogs will NOT be dancing this year but (2) some other cinderella will make headlines by dancing long into the evening.   Click  urlLink here  to see who ESPN's resident Bracketologist thinks will be dancing this year, as of today.  Or, for all you real hoopster hooligans, here's the  urlLink link  to ESPN's Championship Week homepage.

      Our law school's Barrister's Ball (law prom) was this past Saturday night, held at the Indiana State Museum.  I was truly a good time, and it was great to see the masses of people come out for the event.  We sold nearly two hundred more tickets than we had anticipated, so it was quite the event.  Lawren, Heidi, and the rest of the Barrister's Ball committee did a fantastic job planning and coordinating the event, a big kudos to you ladies (and gents).    The one big complaint that I heard about the evening was that there were no knives set out by the caterers.  So, everyone was eating their roast beef "caveman-style."  Oh well, the bar was open (and free) and the liquor was flowing all night long, so I don't think people can really complain too much.  There were certainly a number of people who could have been cut-off from alcohol consumption much earlier, but nonetheless, it made for a great night of "people-watching."   Click  urlLink here  to have a glance at the facility where the Ball was held.  Good times. . . already looking forward to next year's.  Only 363 more days!!!

      Talk about a slam dunk.  Most college students dream of getting a final exam with questions such as: How many points is a 3-pointer worth?  That was among the questions on basic basketball knowledge on the final exam -- and only test -- in Georgia assistant basketball coach Jim Harrick Jr.'s Coaching Principles and Strategies of Basketball class in 2001.  This is absolutely amazing. It's no wonder that college sports have lost some of their luster. See if you're a genius. . . Click  urlLink here  to take the test.

         It's probably safe to assume that a lot of "Sex and the City" viewers aren't necessarily huge fans of "The Sopranos" and vice-versa. But those of you still mourning the loss of "Sex" will probably find much comfort in watching what happens to Tony Soprano and his motley crew of misfits and malcontents as the series returns for its fifth season this Sunday night (9 ET on HBO).   For those of you who know me, I am an avid follower of "The Sopranos." I can probably count the number of episodes I have missed over the first four seasons on one hand.  Needless to say, I am very excited about the premiere this weekend.  For an insider's guide, click  urlLink here . urlLink

      I thought I would let all of my gracious followers, I mean,  follower , (thanks bro) know that I plan to start a couple of Struperman Traditions.  Beginning next week (again, no promises), I plan to launch two weekly features.  The first will be a column called "Sports, Spirits & High Stakes" in which I discuss whatever the hell it is I want to discuss (it is my blog mind you). The second will be a Quote of the Week sort of deal.  I will post a picture and all of you out there can give me a quote that is fitting for the picture.  Best Quote Wins. Simple as that. (Don't ask  what  you win, because I think you know the answer to that).   "You'll Get Nothing and Like It."  More Details to Come. . .

      Well, I know that my Blog has just begun to party for its  one day  birthday, and although quite young, I felt the need to change its name. It will no longer be known as  Liquor, Poker & Soccer .  (sobs)  Have no fear though. This is not the end of a successful run. . . I have decided on the name change more or less because I like the new name better, but also because of the strong sexual innuendos that lay within the old name. Not that I am turning "sally" here, but I just felt it best to be PC. For those of you who are worried, don't fret.  A dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste and the sexual references will remain apparent throughout the blog!

      So, as you can tell, I am pretty excited about this whole blogging thing. Before my class tonight, I was able to sit down with a colleague who is an avid blogger and get some inside info on how this works. So, with all this new info, I got right to work. It just so happened that I was using my class time to work on the blog. So, right in the middle of class, my prof calls "all hands up" and starts walking around looking at everyone's computer screens. Needless to say, he came to me and look at my computer while I was in the middle of editing my blog. I told him straight up, "I'm working on my blog. I'm new to this and its pretty exciting." He just walked away and continued lecturing.  Well, now you know what law school is all about!!!

      So, MLB's Spring Training Is Finally Here.  The Cubbies get their shot at redemption.  Goodbye Steve Bartman. Goodbye goddamn Billy Goat. They will win a World Series by 2006.  A century will not go by without a championship.  I can say though that I am a bit saddened by the fact that this time last year, I was in Arizona soakin' up some rays and catchin' a few Spring Training games.  The highlight of the trip was when I called Kyle Farnsworth a "pussy" because he wouldn't sign any autographs.  He came at me yelling and ordered the security guards to throw me out of the ballpark. I didn't miss much though, it happened in the 9th inning. At any rate, GO CUBBIES.  FYI - www.cubs.com

         Barry Bonds has completed the family circle. And now it's on to the Babe. More history was made Tuesday night at SBC Park when Bonds passed his godfather, Willie Mays, by hitting home run No. 661. He's now all alone in third place on Major League Baseball's all-time homer list, just 53 behind the legendary Babe Ruth, who has 714. Hank Aaron, at 755, is a seemingly distant first, 94 away.  This is a great accomplishment for Mr. Bonds, no matter how big of an ass I think he is.  Arrogant and cocky, yes. The best baseball player of all-time? Maybe. Definitely Top 3 in my book. But I wasn't around to see Mays, Ruth, Gehrig, or Williams play. I can only listen to those who were fortunate enough to see these men at their primes. I will argue though, that it's difficult to compare players who've played in different eras. Ruth never played against a man of color. Mays and Gehrig never played against the "superathlete" of today. Bonds never played in the genormous ballparks of yesterday. Arguments can be made through and through, but one thing is certain, Bonds should be remembered as one of the greatest of all-time. Regardless of the steroid allegations.  The best part about Bonds' accomplishment isn't the accomplishment itself, it's the experiences of one lucky fan. Larry Ellison, the Arnold Schwarzenegger mask-doning man from Fairfield, Calif., is a legend now, and he did so by recoving a Bonds' homerun for the second straight day Tuesday. Ellison was paddling furiously in his inflated kayak in McCovey Cove to where Barry Bonds' career homer No. 661 splashed nearby, just like he did for No. 660.  That's right, "Lucky Man" Ellison recovered both homerun balls, on back-to-back nights. As Iceman pointed out, you'd have a better chance of being struck by lightning. Not according to Ellison though, who strategizes and plans his positions when Bonds steps to the plate. But it gets better: After graciously giving No. 660 to Bonds on Monday, he was given six seats behind home plate for Tuesday's game, which he promptly gave away to family, while he returned to his kayak in McCovey Cove. Don't devalue his 660 gesture by calling his 661 fortune "luck."  What's the larger lesson here? Do the cool, neighborly thing and you'll be rewarded. Maybe not as immediately and ridiculously as Ellison, but his model is one worth following.

         I posted an article some time ago discussing the rooftop debate going on around Wrigley Field.  As you may remember, I reported that one business, Skybox on Waveland, refused to pay the Cubs and would not agree to the revenue sharing. Skybox's attorney Chris Gair said the 125-seat rooftop will "never pay anything" to the Cubs. Boy, was he mistaken. I believe I said, and I quote, "The fans will show hatred toward that business, believe me. And once that happens, I’m willing to bet this business breaks down and strikes a deal with the Cubs. Bunch of friggin’ idiots."  Well, as I predicted,  urlLink The Cubs and the holdout rooftop business settled a federal lawsuit  Thursday after the team had reiterated its plans to block the business' view of Wrigley Field starting with Monday's home opener.  Nice work douchebags. Hold out and pay anyway. Anyone who thought that they were bigger than Wrigley is just stupid and I hope that people realize the business's actions are dispicable. I don't know about anyone else, but I plan to egg the building on my trip to Chicago.   That was a joke people. I won't do anything. Except avoid the place at all costs.

         It just wouldn't be right if I didn't post this story for everyone to read, with my love for Vegas and all. Being a Vegas guy, this story is honestly one of the greatest reads you will find regarding Vegas. For those of you who have been to the Greatest City on Earth, you know what this guy is talking about. For those of you who haven't been, this story provides you with even more reason to want to go.    Here's an excerpt from the story : During a shuffle, the Hard Rock's gaming host introduces himself to Hopper, sweet-talks him, hands him a card. These are the things that happen when you're gambling $100 and $200 a hand for five straight hours -- Hopper even had a passing hooker rub her crotch against his right elbow. At least we think she was a hooker. You never know at the Hard Rock.  And I suggest that you  urlLink click here  to read the whole thing, it's truly stellar. . .

         A British man who sold all his possessions, including his clothes, stood in a rented tuxedo on Sunday surrounded by family and friends and  urlLink bet everything on a single spin of the roulette wheel .  He won't go home empty handed.  Ashley Revell, a 32-year-old Londoner, sold all his possessions in March, took $135,300 to the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, did some low stakes gambling and then placed everything he had left on "Red."  The wheel was spun, a crowd of supporters including his Mum and Dad from London went wild, the ball bobbled over the slots and landed on Red '7' -- and Revell walked away with $270,600.  This guy is my kind of betting man. Our friends over at the  urlLink Gamblers Gazette  first broke this story last week, when Revell announced to the public that he planned to bet it all. Unfortunately though, the G2 staff said to go with black. Thankfully for Revell, he's not an avid reader of the Gazette. He went with red and won big. I would have said go with red, but hindsight is always 20/20.   Had I been gambling that hand, I would have won huge. Those of you who have traveled to Vegas with me know that I always have a chip on Red 7, as well as on Red 21. Those are my two staples.

       urlLink Frequent sexual intercourse and masturbation  may offer some protection for men against the development of prostate cancer, results of a US study suggest.  Writing in the current edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, the research team, led by Dr Michael Leitzmann from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, reports that several studies have sought to determine whether sexual activity is associated with prostate cancer risk, but results have been inconclusive.   In the largest study of its kind to date, the team sought to further investigate the possible link between ejaculation frequency, including sexual intercourse, nocturnal emission and masturbation, among more than 29,000 US men, aged 46 to 81 years.   Indeed, they conclude: "Our results suggest that high ejaculation frequency possibly may be associated with a lower risk of total and organ-confined prostate cancer."  This should serve as good news to my brother, considering his history of salami-smacking.  At any rate, it looks like I need a little more "me time."  I definitely don't want to get prostate cancer and be stuck with frequent anal probings. Man, that hurts just thinking about it. . .

         For Joe Francis, the 31-year-old creator of the "Girls Gone Wild" videos, the pervasiveness of that kind of what-the-heck attitude to self-exposure has been pure gold, providing him with two mansions, including one in Bel Air, Calif., a ski retreat and two jets. Though buyers of his $9.99 (and sometimes more) videos and DVDs, well-advertised on late-night infomercials, are mostly young men, the sunburned, woozy party image the videos project has reached well beyond its core audience. Stars like Brad Pitt have been photographed wearing "Girls Gone Wild" trucker hats, television shows like "Curb Your Enthusiasm" have written the videos into their story lines and John Kerry has jokingly proposed the release of a "Kerry Gone Wild" video.  So this year, after seven years of building his soft-porn empire into what he boasts is a $100-million-a-year business, and despite the fact that multiple lawsuits and a criminal case are pending against him, Mr. Francis has brand expansion on his mind. He is embarking on projects and licensing deals to slap the "Girls Gone Wild" name on restaurants, clothes, music and movies.  I have yet to see one of these videos, but  urlLink here's  another case of someone stealing my million dollar idea. I took my video camera to FLA a number of years ago and got some "decent" footage. Apparently, it wasn't good enough. Or I called the "wrong" people. Oh well, I guess I have to continue on my journey to finding my money-making scheme. . .

         The ladies of NBC's hottest reality TV show have been given the boot by Donald Trump but have other offers coming in. Playboy approached four of the lovely ladies to pose nude for the same salary that Trump will award his "Apprentice" winner. The gals showed they couldn't be bought and turned down the offer but signed with FHM for a scantilly clad spread -- for free. Guess it isn't all about the money!  WTF? I honestly don't see much difference between FHM and Playboy. In Playboy you'll be completely naked, but in FHM you'll have on some underwear and have your hands covering your breasts. I think for that kind of loot, I would have to drop both my hands and my drawers. . .

         The opportunity to have Britney Spears in your establishment could be a big deal but how much is it really worth? The "Toxic" star was performing last weekend in Miami when management at the trendy nightclub Mynt were approached by a member of the pop princess' staff. They offered to have Britney and her posse party it up for a mere $2,000 appearance fee. The club staff held their ground and offered a venue for the star, but refused to pay. Britney took her gang elsewhere for the night. We wonder if they had to pay?   I'd give her and her posse $2K to come party at my apartment. Of course, she'd probably come over for free. I have never had to pay her before. . .

      I am fully aware that I have been anything but attentive to my blogspot. And for those fans I have yet to lose, thanks for your support.  However, life had been a bit trying lately and my own personal kryptonite is having its effect . . . final exams. With all that being said, I'm am certainly not looking for any pity. Just a fair warning to those few people who check this site regularly that the next few weeks will be light, in terms of posts. I have to dispose of the kryptonite and knock out my exams. Once that happens, bring on summer. I will then have more free time than I will know what to do with.

         Mark Prior pitched 4 1/3 innings Tuesday night for the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts, allowing one run and two hits against the West Michigan Whitecaps in the Midwest League game.    The Chicago Cubs right-hander, making the second appearance of his rehabilitation assignment, has been sidelined all season because of an inflamed Achilles tendon and a sore right elbow. He didn't allow a hit in three scoreless innings for Lansing last Thursday.   "I just didn't have the adrenaline going as much as I usually do," he said.   Prior, 18-6 with a 2.43 ERA last year, struck out eight and walked none, throwing 48 of 62 pitches for strikes.   "I feel like I'm getting closer," he said. "I feel like I'm getting back to where it needs to be to get back and compete at that (major league) level. I felt like my breaking ball was better than the last start."   Cubs director of player development Oneri Fleita said Prior's fastball ranged from 89-93 mph. Prior could pitch for Triple-A Iowa on Sunday.   "Looks like he's right on target to me," Fleita said. "Looked free and easy again tonight."   HURRY BACK MARK, PLEASE. In case you were wondering, the Cubs have FIVE (5) starters on the Disabled List and are still only a game and a half out of first in the National League Central. FIVE PLAYERS. Prior, Wood, Sosa, Grudzielanek, and Gonzalez. Maybe if those guys were healthy the Cubs would already have the Central wrapped up. . .

      Plenty of lawyers have dogs -- but how many dogs have lawyers?  At least one. And his name is Cabic.  Lake Circuit Judge Lorenzo Arredondo appointed an attorney Thursday to represent Cabic at a hearing to determine whether he is a wolf-dog hybrid.  For Cabic, the outcome is a matter of life and death.  Cabic bit one of his owner's Cedar Lake neighbors, Mark Schilling, in the thigh on April 18 when Schilling came to borrow a power tool. The dog's owner, Nancy Armalius, does not dispute that.  But Schilling became ill a few days later and doctors told him the bite wound was infected. Animal Control authorities put the dog on a 10-day quarantine to determine if he has rabies.  However, the 10-day waiting period does not apply to wild animals. Under Indiana law, wolf-dog hybrids are considered wild, said Nicholas Doffin, the county health administrator.  "The incubation periods vary in wild animals so you can't determine how long it takes for the disease to surface," Doffin said.  If the judge rules that Cabic is a hybrid, the animal's head must be removed and sent to the state Health Department laboratory to be tested for rabies.  WTF? Johnnie Cochran didn't want to take this one? Only in Indiana. . .

        Get your mind out of the gutter people. . . Randy Johnson, aka "The Big Unit," became the oldest pitcher in Major League history to throw a perfect game, retiring all 27 Atlanta Brave hitters he faced.    It was only the 17th perfect game in Major League history, and the first since 1999.  Johnson once threw a no-hitter, but this obviously tops that.  He became only the fifth pitcher to throw no-hitters in both the National and American Leagues.   Brief Explanation - For those of you who are "rookies," a perfect game means that you retire every batter you face, and don't give up any hits, runs, walks - NOTHING. A no-hitter simply means you didn't allow a hit, but walks and runs are still possible. Both feats are amazing accomplishments, but obviously a perfect game is just that, PERFECT.  You can go  urlLink here  to check out some of the articles written on The Unit's tremendous feat.  He may be one of the ugliest men in the Majors, but he sure is a helluva pitcher. One of the Greatest Left-Handers of All-time. Here's the best part, Johnson is on my fantasy team. Eat that Bro. . . Didn't we say $20 for a no-no???

        A man who cooked and ate nearly 30 cicadas sought medical treatment after suffering a strong allergic reaction to the  urlLink sauteed insects . The man showed up at a Bloomington clinic Thursday covered from head-to-toe in hives, and sheepishly told a doctor he'd caught and ate the cicadas after sauteing them in butter with crushed garlic and basil.  "He said they didn't taste too bad, but his wife didn't care for the aroma," said Dr. Al Ripani, the doctor who treated the man at Promptcare East.  The man, who has a history of asthma and shellfish allergies, suffered a "significant allergic reaction," after eating the cicadas, Ripani said.  What A Dumbass. Sorry, but I'm not munching on anything that only surfaces once every 17 years. Something about that just isn't right. Would you eat beef that was buried for 17 years? Didn't think so.   For those of you in Indiana, you know that all we've been hearing about for the past couple of weeks is how the cicadas are coming. These insects are emerging from the ground by the billions, after living underground for 17 years and feeding on tree roots. Whatever, I have yet to see ONE. Of course, they are more concentrated in Southern Indiana, and less likely to surface in Indianapolis because of all the "ground turn-over" that has occurred in the last 17 years.

      Since I have only published five (5) posts in the last month, I figured I would give a quick life update to all those interested. I am slowly but surely getting back into the blogging rhythm, and I expected to be posting quite a bit more in the near future. But, you must understand, I no longer have those nice long Admin and Tax classes to do my blogging in. . .   No summer classes for me. I registered for Employment Law, thinking it would be a good background class for Labor Law in the fall. However, after getting the syllabus, and missing the first class due to my trip to FLA, I decided that the summer class wasn't worth my time. Or money. Didn't get any financial aid for my summer class because our campus F'd something up. I wasn't going to pay for EMPLOYMENT LAW out of my own pocket. Plus, I want to enjoy my last summer before the hellacious bar exam.  I really am digging my job. Not too many places where you are the "go-to guy" all the time. I'm the only clerk, and that means I get to work on stuff from NCAA issues affecting high schools, to athlete injury cases, to trademark and copyright registrations. It's pretty damn cool. And our office closes at 4:30 pm, so I get to leave at a half-way decent time (assuming all my shit is done, which is the case about half the time). But all in all, it's good.  A final, happy note. Three grades, an A and two Bs. Two yet to come. Hoping for a little love from my profs. If not, I'm still happy with any semester where I get an A (in law school at least). AND FINALLY, I have some "informational" interviews set up in San Diego and I will be making a trip out there over fall break. Let's all pray that I come back with a job. SUN, SAND, and SURF, HERE I COME. . .

      Greetings to  BOTH  of my supportive fans. I'm officially back. I apologize for the rather long hiatus, but finals took over my life in more ways than you could imagine. However, I am officially done, and I've even gotten a small vacation in since finals concluded. So, I'm rested, tanned, blonde (kind of), and ready to roll. Look for a significant increase in postings to come in the very near future!   BTW, the long absence from the blog world seems to have helped my study habits. I've already gotten my first couple of grades back from finals, and I must say, I am VERY happy.

      For those of you who may be confused, no, I'm not preparing to take the bar. . . Yet. I am simply preparing to prepare to take the bar. I realize (from my recent graduate friends) that the bar exam is a HUGE task, and I'd prefer to get everything in line prior to starting classes in the fall. So, I've taken it upon myself (good work, i know) to research the CA bar. I've come to realize that I'm somewhat behind in the game, but it's nothing that I can't overcome. If there are two things I've learned in the past week, it's that you should sign up for BARBRI early in law school(or become a rep) and that it's never really too early to start thinking about the bar exam.  All that being said, I can't believe I'm really going to up and leave Indiana (although we all know it's really not that exciting here in the Hoosier state) and subject myself to what is considered to be one of the hardest bar exams in the US. I'm crazy, I know. And it's not like I have a job offer either, so I'm goin' on a whim. Guess I've finally decided to grab life by the balls and do something I really want to do, for no particularly reason at all. It only took me 26 years (actually 27 before I move). Truly though, it's because I want to get the hell out of Indiana and reside somewhere with half-way decent weather. Oh yeah, and my brother lives out there too. But everyone knows he's a douchebag.  Enough of the sentimental rambling of sorts. Hope you're enjoying the new digs. And for anyone remotely interested in taking the California Bar Exam (ie Shane),  urlLink here's  a GREAT site with stellar info relating to the exam.

I am planning to slowly but surely incorporate some major changes in the blog over the next month or two (assuming that I don't get lazy and just decide to leave it as is). Please look forward to these changes, but also be weary of any technical difficulties that may arise. If you are have problems accessing the page, don't fret. We didn't go anywhere.

          urlLink Here's  a great article on the "Art of Defense" and how appealing it can be to watch a great baseball player make a great play in the field.    BTW, the article mentions Scott Rolen, the Jasper, IN native who is now the All-Star Third Baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals. I completely and whole-heartedly agree with the article that Rolen is the best defensive player in the Bigs. He has averaged approximately 13 errors per season over his first ten big league seasons (including 1996 when he only played 37 games). That's ridiculously low. He has the tools to be the best third baseman of all-time. . . better than Schmidt, better than Robinson. Only time will tell, but I'll be the first person to admit that I will be closely watching this "Hall of Famer in-the-making."   BTW2, if I could figure this Blogger thing out, I'd post a picture of Scottie and I on the field at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. But since I can't, the picture above will have to do. If anyone would like an autographed ball, too bad. Mine's not for sale.

      You have to read  urlLink this article , which talks about a guy who is trying to visit  EVERY  Starbucks in the world. There are almost 5,000 Starbucks in the world right now, and another 500-600 will open this year.  I guess when Starbucks officially takes over the world, (which at the rate they are going, should be by the year 2020) this guy can say he has visited most of them. I sure am jealous. The atmosphere at one Starbucks is enough for me, let alone 5,000 of them. I'd take a double shot in the head before taking a double shot of latte at  EVERY  Starbucks. And am I the only one thinking "health-risk" with all the caffeine this guy is consuming?  Don't get me wrong, I like a Starbucks every once in a while. But its complete domination of the coffee market makes me wonder why someone has yet to raise an antitrust issue. I don't know if there'd be much to hang your hat on, but it's worth a shot, right? For the Coffee Drinkers Society of America?

      For many states, today, July 1, is the effective date for  urlLink laws crafted during legislative sessions . In others, laws take effect January 1, or 90 days after passage.  The new laws will affect all aspects of life. From drugs to marriage to cell phones to pets. So, just as a friendly reminder, it may be wise to check into your new state laws. God forbid you use your cell phone while driving in DC or New Jersey and get stopped for it (yep, no using cell phones!)  So be cautious! You never know. You may be performing an illegal act without knowing it. And if you are in Colorado, keep your dog on a leash. Colorado now requires microchips to be implanted in dogs that bite people, so they can be tracked. . .

         This time, she's marrying for love, Britney Spears said of her recent engagement to dancer Kevin Federline.  Spears, 22, and Federline, 26, began dating a few months ago, after her Las Vegas wedding to childhood friend Jason Alexander in January. That marriage was annulled 55 hours later.  Of the quickie Vegas ceremony, "That thing was a total ugh," she says. "I was not in love at all."  This is different, says Spears, who's wearing a five-carat diamond set atop two slender platinum, diamond-encrusted bands on her left finger.  Federline popped the question on an airplane while flying with Spears from Ireland to New York after the European leg of her tour. "I'd known for a while that she's the one," he says.  Federline, who performed as a backup dancer for Justin Timberlake, Spears' former boyfriend, previously was involved with Shar Jackson, star of TV's "Moesha." They have a 2-year-old daughter and are expecting another baby.  Does anyone else see anything wrong with this picture? She's on her second marriage in a matter of months and this time she's in love? Maybe she's in love with that 5-carat diamond. And this guy already has one kid and now has another on the way? WTF?  On another note, I heard from some news source that Britney actually proposed to this guy. And apparently he balked at first. Are you kidding?   Something's wrong with Britney these days and I'm just not sure what it is. . .
