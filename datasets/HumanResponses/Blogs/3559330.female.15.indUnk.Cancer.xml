      my sound doesnt work i think im going to cry. anyway i would like to give my apologies to price mathews for making him wait like 4 hours alone and have to buy 2 books at book and music exchange. my sister is PSYCHO. she was suppose to take me, and then she was like nope im not. and then she was like ok. and then she was like no im not taking you. this went on for like 3 hours and finally she decided to take me to hang out with price. well i did get to hang out with price eventually. we hung out at dairy queen for a really long time. and we both didnt have any money left so there wasnt much for us to do. but im glad i got to see him since i usually see him like twice a year. we talked and bonded and it was special.   +\I have now been inspired to never eat fast food again. i saw "supersize me" with my aunt and well yeah fuck that, no fastfood is practically impossible. today is going to be reserved for reading. i have to read lord of the flies, which what ive heard is not that bad. And then i have to read some shit book called "The world that trade created: culture, society, and the world economy, 1400 to present" yeah im going to shoot myself in the face before im done with that.   WE ARE GOING TO GET ERICA TOMORROW FROM LEXINGTON BE EXCITED BITCHES THIS OPPURTUNITY DOESNT COME AROUND OFTEN. yeahhhhh
