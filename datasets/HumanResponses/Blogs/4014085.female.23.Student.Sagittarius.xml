      Ok, after freaking out because I still hadn't received my updated voter registration card in the mail, after waiting three weeks,&nbsp;I am now calm.&nbsp; I called Dad and he gave me the super secret number to the Supervisor of Elections so that I could call and check up on it.&nbsp; To my surprise, I spoke to lovely, helpful woman named Angela who told me that it usually takes 4 to 6 weeks to process but that she could do it over the phone for me right now.&nbsp; She then let me know where my polling place was and where I could go if I wanted to vote early.&nbsp;   I would like to say, "Thank you" to Angela again for being extremely nice and informative.   That being said, have you gotten your registration card yet?&nbsp; The deadline is August 2nd, so if you haven't get in touch with your local elections office and get it done!&nbsp; Every vote counts and this time we will make  sure  of it.&nbsp; Here are some links I find informative (some are left leaning, but sue me - I'm an independent liberal and proud of it)    urlLink www.michaelmoore.com &nbsp; -&nbsp; If you haven't yet seen Fahrenheit 9/11, do so.&nbsp; While it is propaganda, it's truthful propaganda and not in any way, shape, or form a Michael Moore film.    urlLink http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war.html &nbsp;- Get Your War On - WARNING!&nbsp; Rated M for Mature and FF for F'ing Funny    urlLink The Daily Show's Indecision 2004 &nbsp;- Where more people get their news than anywhere else....ever.    urlLink It's Not News, It's Fark &nbsp;- The place where I get most of my news.&nbsp; Though if you see the story is reported from Drudge, always check at least 3 of the following to collaborate,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink CNN.com   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink Reuters.com   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Associated Press   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink BBC News    I'm off to read what I missed at the  urlLink Democratic National Convention .&nbsp;

      I was browsing around the interent after reading the Executive Summary of the 9/11 Commission and happened upon this gem.      Voting Official Seeks Terrorism Guidelines Fri Jun 25, 3:59 PM ET By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - The government needs to establish guidelines for canceling or rescheduling elections if terrorists strike the United States again, says the chairman of a new federal voting commission. Such guidelines do not currently exist, said DeForest B. Soaries, head of the voting panel.    &nbsp;  Ok.......someone besides me has to be saying, "WTF?"   Cancel the elections?&nbsp; You don't cancel the elections!&nbsp; You certainly don't bring up cancelling&nbsp; the elections one month before the primary election!&nbsp; Does this look like a last minute ditch effort on Bush's behalf to stay in office no matter what?&nbsp; How long do we cancel the&nbsp;voting for?&nbsp; A month?&nbsp; A few?&nbsp; A year?&nbsp; The fact that this actually came out of an officials mouth makes me ill.&nbsp; Back to your regularly scheduled programming.

      The following is a conversation I've just had with my good friend Frankie.&nbsp; He conceded that I won the argument but has not conceded to conceding that I won the argument.&nbsp; I will let the public decide.   P.S.&nbsp; I'm right.   It all began with a rail gun........   --------------------------------------------  Tali : I'm going to buy a real camera   Frankie : I have no contacts in and at first glance that read I'm going to buy a rail gun. &nbsp;Don't know why   Tali : LOL&nbsp;That'd be cool too   Frankie : Imagine the things you could do with one.   Tali : Ummmm...Frankie? What's a rail gun?   Frankie : Its a gun that shoots giant metal slugs out at speeds close to 4 times the speed of sound. It uses electromagnets to propel these slugs through a rail and out at amazing speeds   Tali : Holy fuck   Frankie : The cool thing is the amount of electricity used in propelling the slug usually causes it to turn into a giant ball of plasma. Very cool shit.   Tali : I need one   Frankie : Everyone needs one   Tali : Well, not everyone   Frankie : No no really...everyone...its like the same theory as in the cold war   Tali : No no. Everyone except the people I want to shoot   Frankie : see...thats why you shouldn't have WMD's   Tali : ROFL That makes no logical sense. Why in the Gods' names would I want my enemies to have the same weapon as me?   Frankie : You're like Iraq man.&nbsp; You're a loose cannon with no understanding of the ramifications.&nbsp;   Tali : Tactically speaking, I want them to have crappier versions of the same weapon.   Frankie : Nope...for the good of man kind its better to have everyone on equal settings.   Tali : No it's not. Then we just blow up each other equally thereby DESTROYING mankind. That's not good.&nbsp;I may not be an anthropologist but I know blowing each other up till we're all dead is not good.   Frankie : No seriously...for one it keeps people on the edge and from using the weapon in fear of retribution.&nbsp; it also is an amazing way to inspire development of new technologies. True...but look at history as an example. Look at how much money was dumped into R&D just based on the fact that we had to stay one ahead of the russions. Sadly enough fear is a great motivater.  Tali : It also is a dangerous balance cause one press of the button from them, then I'm going to have to press the button cause, well fuck, if I'm going to die then they are too, and BAM!&nbsp; no more mankind. And the Russians never had the same weapons as us.&nbsp; They had crappier versions of ours  Frankie : Nope...but we sure thought they did ;)  Tali : So my argument stands correct. Thank you  Frankie : No it doesnt. You're crazy  Tali : You just said so  Frankie : No...I said "we thought they did" which is equivilent to then having it.  Tali : Re read your log of this conversation and get back to&nbsp;me.&nbsp;&nbsp;The general public thought they did, our government knew they didn't hence them making better ones and allowing the soviet union to buy the cheap knock-offs.&nbsp; I still win  Frankie : Nope :: hits you in the arm ::  Tali : Yes, and&nbsp;I'm posting this conversation on my blog to prove my point  -----------------------------------------------------------  I'll let the readers decide who won (me!) .

      So after making the decision to write this book two days ago, and writing (somewhat in between work and sleep) for two days, the grand total of pages done is:   &nbsp;   4 1/2.   I suck.   I am out of practice so it's taking me some time to formulate the thoughts so that they make sense to the general public and not just me.&nbsp; I should not get discouraged, especially considering I have no idea what this book will be about.&nbsp; I writing by ear.&nbsp; Flying by the seat of pants.&nbsp; Noo f'in clue as to what I'm writing.&nbsp; So really 4 1/2 pages isn't bad at all.&nbsp; For now.&nbsp; I need to speed up the story.&nbsp; In which case, I need to find out what the story is.&nbsp; In which case I should figure that out before I try to write more.&nbsp; Grrrrrrrrr.&nbsp; I will do this.&nbsp;   Note to self:&nbsp; Also need to finish crap script.&nbsp; If only to finish it.&nbsp; Must finish it.&nbsp; No longer going to write people out of it.&nbsp; Need higher body counts.

      I have managed to once again delay getting my application to Valencia.&nbsp; Instead of doing it yesterday, right after work, just like I planned, I went to Starbucks and wrote for three hours.&nbsp; Now I'm not saying it was bad for me to write cause it wasn't.&nbsp; I need to get back in that schedule and I'm happy that I've forced myself in to it.&nbsp; But I really need to drop off that application or everything goes to hell in a handbasket.&nbsp; Le sigh.&nbsp; I, also, now have a crush.&nbsp; However, it is a secret and this is the internet so the name shall never be written here.&nbsp; Just be happy for me that I have a crush, ok?&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know I'm in the minority here, but I love having crushes on people who I know&nbsp;will never like me in return.&nbsp; I'm not saying I'm some deformed monstrosity, just the facts.&nbsp; I don't stress about if they like me back, or if I'm flirting too hard, or if I'm blushing too much.&nbsp; It's all&nbsp;fun.&nbsp; I can relax around them and have no expectations whatsoever.&nbsp; Of course, I wouldn't mind if they liked me back but I'm not going to think on that.&nbsp; Why don't I ask them out, you ask?&nbsp; For the simple reason that I'm&nbsp;scared and I don't like rejection.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Weren't expecting an honest answer were you?&nbsp; Showed you, I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;   In other news, I'm still looking for a picture phone.&nbsp; All the ones the&nbsp;Cingular store by my work had were ass.&nbsp; I need to take photos!&nbsp; Anthony found his old&nbsp;camera and it got me itching to start taking photos again.&nbsp; I used to, back in the day.&nbsp; Back when I had enough creative energy to rival Michelangelo.&nbsp; Ok, maybe not him....but I was a little artistic genius.&nbsp; So in addition to the camera phone I will be purchasing an actual&nbsp;camera.&nbsp; Not a&nbsp;point and shoot one.....a real one.&nbsp; One that takes a certain amount of skill to operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very excited and am browsing for one today.&nbsp;   Time for the work.&nbsp;

      After thinking out this whole website/blog thing I've decided to just go for it and get my own site.&nbsp; Mostly because I hate the template that I have now but my choices were limited.&nbsp; So Anthony has graciously agreed to design my site in exchange for food and I am happy.&nbsp; Today I register the domain name and buy the hosting service.&nbsp; Also, I've decided to take the general concensus and write a book.&nbsp; I'm hoping to be able to just write bits and pieces at a time and set it up like a collection of short stories about my life.&nbsp; We'll see how it comes along.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm at work right now so I guess I better earn my pay.&nbsp;

      If you’ve been having a great day, are madly in love, or are just generally content and happy with this day stop reading now. One of the reasons I wanted this blog was to lance a few wounds. Draw out the poison that seems to always be lurking just under the surface of my smiling facade. If I am going to truly make my life better I need to, if not get rid of, at least acknowledge the places of my soul where no light can escape. Ah, but where to begin? At the beginning? It’s funny, because I don’t remember a beginning. That is, I can’t recall a time when I haven’t been shadowed. There are time periods when it seems to dissipate, but it just lurks. Waiting for it’s time to come again. I remember, way back when, when it first hit hard. No one seemed to understand what was happening to my mind. How I could be logical yet hysterical at the same time. How I could be depressed but not sad. How I could actively speak of the pain and how much I just wanted it to stop at the same time I spoke of how much I loved being alive. If you’ve never been depressed (and I don’t see how that’s possible) you can’t imagine the torment. Everything and nothing sets you off. One minute you’re laughing, smiling, the life of the party. Then something will happen. A trigger. It could be a glance from someone, a song playing in the background, the way the light is casting a shadow on the wall and you shut down. Or I should say the barricades come up. You lock yourself up so no one can come in, but also so you don’t have to come out. Then your remarks, once sarcastic but light-hearted, mutate in to cynical barbs. Directed at anyone or anything in your line of sight, even yourself. The worst part, is that you can’t stop it. You can’t stop the comments and the gestures from pouring out of you anymore than a pebble could plug up an erupting volcano. You strike out at those who love you the most and who you love more than life itself. And you just can’t stop. You see their tears and while it rips your guts in two to see it happening you get a perverse pleasure out of seeing someone else in pain. It’s as if there is so much agony inside of you that in order to relieve it you must transfer it. How often did I make my mother cry? My mother who sacrificed almost everything she had so that I was loved and safe? How many times did my family lie in their beds and pray that I would get better? How often did I scorn them? How many times did I disappoint them? Over and over again. Finally I found a solution to my lashing out and disturbing habits. I sank within myself. I likened it to being underwater. I would drift down in to my private abyss and watch through the haze of calm water my loved ones try to reach me, begging me to come to the surface. Many of them would dive in after me only to find me too deep to grasp. And there I would sit, at the bottom of this ocean, gazing with curiosity but nonchalance at their efforts. Not kicking up to meet them halfway. Not breathing. Just blinking against the current as it gently swept past me. Down there, it was so quiet. No noises to trigger the migraines. No movement to set my weary mind afire with thoughts and plans. No distraction from myself. At the bottom, not even the pain could touch me. I believed it to be my Nirvana. No more thoughts of destruction I couldn’t curb. No arguments between conflicting screaming voices. I didn’t have to deal with the hurt, the rejection, or the tears. I became the water and the water became me. I would hover just above the ground on my back and let the water move me it as it willed. Lazily, I would watch the hues of my abyss change colors. From light blue towards the surface, to midnight blue in the middle, to the pitch black night at the bottom where I stayed. The darkness that once unsettled me to the point of panic now became my protector. Surrounding me in a lover’s embrace, it held me in warmth and security. It kept out the ever creeping light of the world above that always threatened to steal me away from the sanctuary I had created. I could see people talking but could hear no voices. The dark kept them out as well. But this peace battled away not only the pain, but all emotions, including love. I had induced a catch-22. Whereas I didn’t have to hurt, I could also not bask in the love that had been so integral to my well being all my life. My soul was dying in that underwater prison and the light within myself, the light which at one time was blinding, was now no more than a glimmer, a dying ember where a sun used to be. I can’t recall when the realization came. I only know that somewhere along the line shards of light began to break through my barrier of black. The faintest strands of hope and love and life began to appear around me. The edge of my senses began to acknowledge these intruders and then it happened. With my listless eyes I followed the lights upwards to the surface and I saw where they came from. Standing so far above me were the faces that I knew from my other life. The life of torture and anguish and unrelenting pressure. But the faces were no longer talking. They simply were gazing down at me. And as I looked upon each face, memories sprang up.   There was my Uncle Johnny. Instantly, an image of a Lite Brite comes up. And there I am, very young, sitting on his lap as he and play with my new birthday present. We are laughing and happy. A softball glove is the next picture. It’s an old, worn out grayish glove that is held together, barely, by a few strands of leather. But I love it. I love it because it was his old glove and now he has bequeathed it to me. I love that glove because it holds in it my awe of him. My admiration of my tall strong uncle who taught me about baseball and football. I love it because I love him.   There was my Aunt Laurie. A piano materializes before me. I see myself playing, trying so hard to concentrate on the fingering and rhythm. Then I see my aunt, sitting patiently next to me. Giving me gentle encouragement and lessons. I listen to her after we are done with the scales and pieces as she tells me about her experiences with boys and school and these piano lessons become something more. They become a bond with a woman who didn’t have to love me. Didn’t have to embrace me like she did and put up with my frustrations with myself as I slam my hands down on the keys of her piano. Then I remember, so long ago, a Halloween where she took me trick and treating. Nothing spectacular happened. Nothing life changing. But I remember sorting the hoard after the walk laughing as she playfully tried to steal some pieces of candy. I love her because she didn’t have to love me.   There was my Uncle Michael. A Weird Al tape comes in to my mind. A gift from him. A shared love of parody music and Pee Wee Herman bonded us together. Here, yet again, was a man who was under no obligation to love me. We shared no blood yet he shared his heart with me. I see us in an aquarium. He pointing out interesting stuff and then holding me in a comfortable but protective embrace as we walk past the huge tanks and models hanging from the ceiling that terrify me. I see myself lying face down on a bed in Baltimore, crying uncontrollably as I learn of the death that will take my great-grandmother away. In comes my uncle, and I feel his hand on my back and consoling words. In that touch and voice I can feel his love and strength as well as his hopelessness in his inability to spare me the pain. I love him because he loves me.   There was my Aunt Kimie. A memory of her taking me and a friend to see a movie comes forth. A horrible movie about video games that could only have made her want to shoot herself in the head rather than watch it but she watched it anyway because I wanted to. I can see myself in pajamas on a couch in an apartment. A sleep over with my beloved aunt who always had time for me and never spoke down to me and treated me as a young adult when I was a yound adult. The moods which were fun and happy and exciting overwhelm me. &nbsp;How could&nbsp;I have forgotten a lifetime of love from her?&nbsp; A Baltimore image is next as I see myself wake up to find my aunt and uncle in the room holding tickets to Hershey park I see her pregnant and glowing. I see us on a plane headed to Chicago. A change of plans cuts my visit with them short for my great-grandmother has passed away. I am holding my aunt’s hand, seeing her puffy eyes and try not to cry so that I don’t upset her further. I love her because she has always loved me.   There was my Grandpa. A barrage of images flash in my mind. I recall him teaching a small girl how to make rude noises with her armpits. His laugh at my giggle as I fly about the house showing everyone my new found skill. I can see myself sitting at his bar, playing grown-up as he serves me, just like a real bartender, my juice in an adult glass. I remember his smile as I so carefully lifted the glass to sip then slowly put it back down so I wouldn’t break Grandpa’s glass. I remember flying in his arms as he spun me round and round high in the air. My exhilaration as we played in the sideyard. He chasing me, then me chasing him. I see him point two fingers at my face. One finger level at each eye and I, from careful training, now instinctively put a hand up between my eyes to stop his Three Stooges attack. I see conversations through the years about cars, sports, and life in general. Most of all I see his love. I love this man who became a father figure for me. This man who filled two parts so that I would not feel the lack of love. I love my tall strong handsome grandpa. His arms never failed to make me feel safe. His smile never failed to make me laugh. I love him because he loves me enough for two, father and grandfather.   There was my Grandma. Grilled cheese is the first thought. There is no better grilled cheese than the one my grandma makes for me. I remember long talks about ourselves. The way she always understood exactly how I felt and what I was going through and never failed to have sound advice to ease my woes. I can see her face as I play piano for her after school. Her pride and love showing on her face as my hands gracefully floated over the keys, playing the music that was my solace. But most of all I remember her hugs. She hugs me in a way only a grandma could. An all encompassing embrace that I melt in to. In her arms there is strength and love and compassion and empathy and she embodies everything a grandmother should be. I love her becomes she loves me completely.   There is my Mom. It is then I comprehend how much love one can have for another. I recall bruised elbows and skinned knees healed by her touch and kisses. I see me on a new bike and her near by but not lording over me. Knowing how much space to give me so that I can learn but close enough to help if I fall. I see late nights on the couch watching PBS. I am cuddled up beside her. So many nights like this one. I see her rejoicing in my triumphs and sympathizing with my losses. But she is always there. No matter what. Her arms always open to hold me when I need her to shield me from the world outside. Her words, truthful and direct, guiding me in to adulthood. My mind can not settle on one memory of this woman for more than a second. There are too many. But they all share one thing. Love. This woman and I share heart and soul. Together we have come through hell and back and lived and thrived all because we had each other. She gave me her sense of humor. That innate ability to find the laughter in any situation. Because, as she taught me, if we can not laugh about it we will never heal from it. I see the small sacrifices add up through the years. I see her give everything to me so that I may be a better person. I see the love she has for me in every kiss, every hug, every look, and every word. In turn, I remember my love for her. It was never a question that I loved her. It simply was. This woman would give her life for me as I would give it for her. There was never a time when I didn’t have her there, if not in person than in spirit. I realize that she has counted on me just as much as I have counted on her. I love her because I could not fathom not loving her. Without her there would be no love. Without her I would not know love nor safety nor strength. She embodies all these things and for that I love her as well with all my heart and soul and mind. With each memory remembered, another stream of light found it’s way down to the depths. Soon I was bathed in a glow of love and family. My weary and starved soul soaked it up and started to intensify it’s own glow till I was again awash in what seemed like a million stars all shining down on me. My eyes finally saw what I had ignored for so long. Without hesitation, I reached up with one hand and propelled myself towards the surface. Towards the love and open arms of my family who had never wavered by my side during my withdrawal. They merely waited for me to realize what they knew I would. That while there might be pain and suffering there will always be love and hope to balance it out. And I would never walk this world alone. Not when they loved me so completely. Not when I loved them so completely. When I finally reached the surface, I took my first true breath and smiled. The softball gloves, the piano lessons, the trips to aquariums, the sleep overs, the lessons in rude noises, the grilled cheeses, the new bikes, these were what kept people sane. These seemingly insignificant situations that happen everyday were what finally snapped me back to sanity. I would like to say that after the ordeal I was perfect but you and I know that it doesn’t work that way. But now I know the warning signs and how to handle them. Now I know that I am not alone. Now I know that no matter what happens I will be loved by these people who raised me within their arms. Every now and then the darkness will beckon me. Every now and then I retreat back in to that sanctuary I made so many years ago. But now I don’t allow my eyes to close. Now I watch the lights and after a period of reflecting in the black I swim towards the surface. The once prison is now my quiet place where I can go to think over things or just be still in this hectic world. The main difference is that it is no long total black. Even at the bottom, I am surrounded by slivers of illumination that pierce through the barriers so long ago put up, always the light is there to guide me back home.

      Here it is.&nbsp; The blog I should have started a year ago is finally on it's way.&nbsp; From today on out I will write at least one entry a day.&nbsp; That's that.&nbsp; I can't promise that each and every one will be great.....I can't even promise they won't be outright crap.&nbsp; But I can promise that I will be truthful and thoughtful and offensive.&nbsp; Today, I go to buy a picture phone so I can post some pics.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's all I got right now, will post more later, after the adventure.

      Today I officially received a raise at work.  I am beyond happy and grateful and am doing dances of joy all over the place.  This weekend I pay two bills (that's right, only two left) and the rest I shall buy new clothes with.  It will be a happy weekend.   Sidenote - Lindsey and I walked 4.2 miles last night.  I feel invigorated.  We also took a friend to Fairvilla Megastore.  It was fun for all.   More news later.

      This week I start my new exercise routine. I'll be walking a minimum of 2 hours a day to tone up and get this fat off my body. It feels great to eat well and exercise. That and there's this shirt at the Mall at Millenia that I want like burning. So come payday (Friday) I will be off to buy me some goodies and feel pretty. The new position at work rocks and I really like what I'm doing now. The stress has gone down to a minimum and my skin is already clearing up. I wrote about two pages last night for the book and will try to work on some more tonight. At the moment, I have the script to finish, this blog to update (and I will update it damn it), the book to work on, and maybe a poem or two just for good measure. I need to get back in the swing of things as far as writing goes and I'm coming a long way in this past week to my goal. Won't be able to afford school this semester but that's ok. This way I can focus on my body and mind and not worry about passing exams and grades. That and I've managed to mess up my checkbook again so I'm rethinking the whole "major in accounting" path. I'm going to try to talk Lindsey in walking six miles tonight. I'm on a roll and I will have some of the ickiness on my thighs gone by Friday. You might think this is impossible, but not so. With conditioning I can achieve anything.  I would also like to congratulate myself for showing restraint last night at the Sanrio store. They have the coolest  urlLink Chococat  and  urlLink Badtz Maru  bags ever. But I will not be buying them. I am to prioritize and have decided that I already have cool bags and I need clothes more. Which I do.  Thinking more on it I might change my mind by Friday and buy one of the bags. Whatever.  Sidenote - Hopefully I can bribe Anthony with lots of food to get my new site up soon. That would be sweet.
