        July 27, 2004 5:27 PM           I had my first and last encounter with cutting today. I just wanted to see...Why so many people do it...Does it help you forget. Well I was too stupid to think of using a razor blade(and I don't know if I even have one). So I used knives which didn't cut very deep. Since it wasn't working, I went on the Internet to and looked it up. Then I read this blog making fun of people who mutilate themselves. That's when I remembered that cutting is for people who want attention. I admit that I wanted the attention. At least to some extent anyway. Well at least I wasn't bored for awhile there.          I wrote that in my journal. My mom is trying to read it, so I need to find a hiding place. Why are parents so damn nosy? Well now the cuts are practically gone and no one noticed. The only person who would really care was my mom. MJ would tell me it was stupid. And I agree. I'm not the type of person who would mutilate themselves for attention. Now I'm just like every other depressive teenager out there. Yippee.         July 27,2004 6:40 PM           I still like Orion. Maybe even more than I used to. Oh well. That's life. I realized it when he came over again. It was a shock really. I forgot about him for a long time. I'll get over it again. I did after we broke up.           My life is pathetic. I don't even care anymore. It won't get better, or worse. But it will change. Change is something I know will happen, so in a way it's reliable.           I hate change, but it's comforting too. If I don't like how things, I know they'll change. Some people say that things change for the better or the worse. I think it just depends on how you look at it.          I still think that life is just what you make of it. But maybe some people don't have the ability to look on the good side of things. I think that sometimes I lose the ability to look at the good side.

        My life is pretty boring. It consists of watching The Butterfly Effect over and over again, and getting online. I told you it was boring. So that's why I started this bloc; to have something to do when I'm so bored committing suicide seems like a good idea. Not that anyone will really ever read this. Unless, I tell my few friends about it, which I won't. I don't really tell my friends anything. I used to tell my close friends everything. Now I don't think of any of my friends as close. Maybe MJ, but she's in Ohio now. So even she feels far away. I wish she didn't move. Then again there's a lot of things I wish...

       Oh yea. I had a lot of fun with my mom tonight, which is really odd. I mean I love her and everything, but usually we don't have the same idea of fun. But today we drove to her collage on the way back from my friend's house, and I had fun. She gave me a tour and we drove around her old neighborhood. That was sad because she said it had gotten worse than when she lived in it. Those people were pretty poor. It really made me appreciate what I have. I know it sounds corny, but it's true. Then we went to go eat at this restaurant. The food was really tasty, and my mom told me some stories from collage. She told me she was a whore in a play, which I thought was hilarious. Probably because my mom used to say she made a lot of mistakes in collage, and MJ and I always joked that it was that she was a whore. Anyway, when we were heading home we talked more and my mom said that the town had gotten a lot worse since she was in collage. Still, it was pretty interesting to see a part of my mom's life I didn't know about. Then we went to DQ and got their new Brownie Batter Blizzard, which is delicious.

       I just got back from Evansville where I was visiting a friend. I hadn't seen her in awhile and we've sort of grown apart which made me sad. She's been my friend since I was six months old. But I still had fun. Her family is a lot different from mine. They only listen to Christian music. Her dad was doing missionary work in Guatemala, when he was robbed and held at gunpoint for two hours. All that to help teach people about God.   I don't really believe in God that much anymore. I just can't bring myself to believe in some of the things they say in the Bible. Maybe I should read the whole thing.       It's weird. I actually want to go back to school to learn and have something to do. Usually, I just want to go back to see my friends. Only I don't want to go back without MJ, but there's nothing I can do about that. The other reason I don't want to go back is, I made enemies with the most popular guy in school. It's a really long story. He was my friend, which was weird because he was so popular. Now he probably hates me. That's how I want it to be though.       This year at school I'm going to focus on learning. I will try and learn as much as I can, and I'll try reading a lot again.I don't want to be a teacher's pet though. I hate most of my teacher's so I won't be.
