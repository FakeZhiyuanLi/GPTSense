        Why must people  torture  me?      &nbsp; OK.     &nbsp;&nbsp; This morning when I woke up and got out of bed, I found a note that said:     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kristen,       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to talk. I'll be home by one. If your not in the house, come home when you see me.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not even a  LOVE  Mom, just&nbsp;a mom. And it was written in cursive!! This is horibble. I'm so scared, but I shouldn't be if I haven't done anything wrong, right?      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm still terrified.       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have to wait till friggin 1:00 to even see her expression!! If she was here today, we could just TALK, But Nooooo, I have to wait in suspense, thinking horibble things till she gets here. I don't even know if I WANT to go outside today. I'm scared.  *shrugs*      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry I haven't wrote inna while. I just forgot. :(      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Umm, what's been going on. Well, Britt left yesterday morning. {1.)Brittany- One of my best friends. Known me for a while too.}&nbsp; And she might see Stephen while she's up there, cuz the Leiningers (his family)&nbsp;are going up to UCF to see Melody (his sister)&nbsp;graduate. {1.) Stephen- I met him at church. Known him for years too. One of my best guy friends.} So Britt's psyched cuz she may see Stephen up there at the graduation, cuz she's going up to Orlando to see her sister, Tiffany, and Tiff's best friend Andrea is graduating and they're gonna go see her graduate.  *shrugs*  It's a small world, eh??      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cindy's sleepin over tonight, and hopefully on Tuesday, we're gonna go to the mall.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll ttyl when I find out what my mom wants to  TALK&nbsp;  to me about.  *cringes*       &nbsp;XxO xXo, Which Do You Prefer? Big Or Small!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

        &nbsp;&nbsp; Life...This thing ppl call life...It's way too confusing.. As my s/n says KrAzeDNKoNFuZLeD~~Which means Dazed and Confused, just with K's.&nbsp;Since K's my favorite letter and all. Altho my real name starts with "C" for real. I don't tell ppl like that tho since I grew up spelling my name with a "C", cuz it was supposed to be spelled with a "K". The nurse skrewed up on my birth certificate, so....I'm cursed with the "C". I have to ask like.. all my teachers if I can spell my name with a "K" instead of a "C" and they all just let me do it. So, whatever. If they don't I hate them for the skoo lyear...Hey, whatever. :P~~~~      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, anywayz.......Ed's playing the Wrestling thing again and it's the big man he made against this really skinny short midget, ET, lookin things...........And I wanna watch, So, I'll bbl!!!!! B ByeNeSS!!!!

       These stupid freakin kids bug the crap outta me. (Sorry for saying crap), but they are. It's SO FREAKIN ANNOYING, you having to lock all your doors to your cars and stuff. We don't usually do it cuz we're so comfortable and not on anyone's bad side. Our car got broken into. How much more parc (look at it backwards) can happen this week!?!?!?   &nbsp; My grandma had a heart attack (dad's mom) 2 nights ago. We went to go see her yesterday, I'm hearing more lies about myself...people are talking about me...AGAIN, and now Daddy's softball equipment&nbsp;and my glove has been stolen?? What's this madness, and why!?!?    &nbsp;Earlier this week, Daddy said he found 2 of our CD's in the grass and we were putting piece and piece together and figured someone stole our stuff..... I'll WBL, I'm going up to the field w/ Jojo to see if our stuff is up there....

       &nbsp;&nbsp;   Another one of my favorite songs. There's SO much meaning in it...You just have to  look  and  understand  the song to get it all.....     I never said I'd prove it, I only said I'd show it  I gave you my all, but you wanted more  Lost on the inside, filling up the score.   I remember playing that one. It's stuck in my head.  Over and Over. I took and you bled.   I never said I'd prove it, I only said I'd show it  I gave you my all, but you wanted more  Lost on the inside, filling up the score.   I am impatient. Misunderstood.  What ever it is, I've got what it cured.  To your arms I run. My own life, it crumbles.  No longer am I damned. No longer do I stumble.   I remember playing that one. It's stuck in my head.  Over and Over. I took and you bled.

       Hey &nbsp;  I thought today was gonna be another suicidal says, but...It wasn't. I'd went outside and stayed out there for a while... Sat at the table out there and put my head down.&nbsp;Mom (Ms.Wendy...I will call her...Mom (W), mwahahahahahahah!!!!)&nbsp;was taking Cindy to work and Cindy leaned her head out and said "Bye". It got my attention, so I waved and said bye back. &nbsp;&nbsp; That was it... It did start raining while they were gone, but I didn't move. I didn't care. What's a little water gonna do? I'm a big girl...I can take a little water. Well, anyway, When I saw that Mom (W) had gotten home, She went inside and a bit later, Jojo&nbsp; came out. I didn't do anything about it tho. He was walking back and forth, obviously trying to get my attention, (he does it often, so I know) but this time, I didn't want to move. I still felt like he didn't really care. After a while, I got up and walked off thru my backyard to the street on the other side... I started walking up that street, trying not to cry again, cuz I started to feel bad. I looked thru the houses to the other side. My street. Guess who I saw walking down the street, following me...? Jojo, he was walking down the other street watching me. Whoa, caught me completely off guard, sorta scared me. I didn't know quite what he was doing. What a stalker.. I still didn't think he cared or wanted to talk to me tho, so I continued to walk. Maybe he just felt like walking too... &nbsp; Not to far up 130th street, there was an old lady. She had a walker, and she was trying to carry a garbage can. I figured I'd stop and help her, you know? It would also give Jojo some time to walk ahead of me so I could watch him, not the other way around. So, here's me, about to stop and she stops me and says "Scuse me, miss. Would you please help me out and take this garbage can back by the steps for me? I fractured my hip in 2 places, so it's kind of hard for me." Of course I did it, but got all mixed up with where she told me to put it. So here's stupid me, like "Here?" "No" "Here?" "Umm, right beside the steps honey" I almost walked into the backyard. The woman put power in her voice.. "No! Beside the steps. Over here, honey." I was pretty freaked out then. Went back to her and she started talking about how her roommate fractured her ankle and it healed up wrong. Poor them. I could see Jojo up ahead waiting for&nbsp;something. Maybe me? Well, anyway, she couldn't drive and her roommate couldn't drive. I had to ask how she got around and then she started talking about hoe people from her church do things for her.... Hey, that's cool. There's lil old ladies at out church who have to do the same things. I told her how I go to church ALL THE WAY down in N. Miami Bch...I was really curious about why Jojo was stading there, so I kept staring over at him, just to see him staring over at me. Wow. That stare is pretty powerful. It obviously meant we needed to talk... So, I tried to get the lady to, well...shut up.. Man, that sounded kinda mean..I wanted to get away, so I told her that maybe I'd stop by sometime and see if she needed a hand or anything. Bingo! Got away safely.  &nbsp;Walked right past him.....well, I almost did, but couldn't bring myself to do it. I asked him what he was standing out there for and he asked me if I wanted to talk. Of course I did, so we went over to the playground and talked in our usual spot. A family came by with a kid, so we left, and went to walk around. During that whole walking around time, we'd stopped and were in between Maya's house and the vacant house next door to her. I was still pretty upset, ready to cry. He kept making me smile and laugh... I hated it, yet, I loved it at the same time...   It got me mad, but made me happy.   *shrugs*   Whatever, after that, my day was great. &nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that made me sad after that is how I'd already asked Cindy what day she wanted to go to the mall with me and Taylor. She said Thursday.&nbsp;Later, after she hung with Maya, she came up and told Jojo how her, Deserae (Dunno if that's how u spell it..), and Maya were gonna go to the mall on Thursday. No mention of me, or Taylor. It hurt, yeah. Whatever tho, I should know not to make plans or anything.   *shrugs and sighs*   I slept with like...a bunch of my stuffed animals and junk last night. It made me feel better. SO much better. If I ever mention suicide in here, know I'm way too scared to do it cuz I know I'd go to hell. I really don't wanna go to hell..... I mean, It's   >>>  HELL  . Anyone who wants to go there is absolutely stupid. Anyway, that's all for today... I wanna go try to beat Shawn at Chess....B Byeness!!!!!

        This is one of my favorite songs, It's short, and straight to the point...    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another day seems like it's wasted.You don't feel you're any closer to the prize.A dead end job where there's no future.Praying that tomorrow things won't be this way.     &nbsp;

        "I, R0B0T". Man, if that wasn't one of the phreakiest movies I ever saw...It was  AWESOME   tho. It showed   Will Smith's   big black booty on the screen, but Ed told my mom about it and We knew just when to turn our heads. The movie was set up for like...a   "We, R0B0TS".   My phone was acting all skrewy and junk, so I recieved a bunch of my text messages late. One was from Jojo saying "can you come here for just one sec plz" and I had no idea what time it was, so I headed outside...but, then one came right after that one that said "never mind enjoy ur night. i'm not going to be here so bye" ... So, I think I skrewed up and he's mad at me. I didn't forget tho!!!&nbsp; I was doing something for my mom!!! I swear. I just don't like him mad at me...I'll BBL, (be back later)&nbsp;or I'll WBT (write back tomorrow)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xXo XxO, Which Do You Prefer...? Big Or Small???

      &nbsp; Man, it's Saturday and the best part of the day was goin to play softball...or practice. Whatever you call it when your playing with 3 ppl. Practice. Well, anyway. Mommy wants to go see  "I  ,R0B0T"   and me and daddy'll go to just about any movie. I think the movie might be scary. I'm so dumb. I get scared at the weirdest movies (Signs, The Sixth Sense, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory)..but I can go through the scariest movies without flinching.   I phreak myself out sometimes...   I finally got that Tag Board thingy at the bottom of the page, but I did something to skrew up me profile!!! It's not there anymore! I'm so dumb, maybe I should've just left it alone, but I didn't want it at the bottom of the page. Sheesh. *yawns*...It's 2:34, and I don't think I'm fully awake yet. Man,   this sux  . &nbsp;I dunno what it is, but it sux, whatever it is. I wonder if this'll work. I took this quiz thigy, so I'll try to put it here...

      &nbsp; They have those stoopid freaking sites to go to when your bored.. They don't work..(for me, anyway). I had to turn off the sounds for AIM cuz when   too many people   IM you, the ring ring, moo's and burps...get quite annoying.   *sigh*   Man, forget livejournal, this seems much better. Is there a such thing as boring yourself...To DEATH!? I mean, what the flip? But I have a crudload of ppl on Yahoo now and....The Yahoo high-pitched "rrrriiinnng" is getting annoying too. I'll listen to my music. I'm pretty dumb, I was sitting here with the headphones in, sulking about the sounds of Yahoo. It's like how I ran into that door at Wal-Mart, thinking it was an automatic door. Some people walk into it, but I ran into it. It's like one of those stunts you see on TV.   *sigh*   My lil bro got a kick outta it tho.   "Kristen ran into a door! Hahahahahahahahaha!!!"   Funny. I laughed.   *rolls eyes*  &nbsp; I guess it would've been funnier...if it happened to someone else. I think that's stupid tho... How are you gonna sit there and be  pissed off  when something   "funny"   happens to you and laugh when it happens to someone else? I hate that. Some people just suck.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a month ago,&nbsp; me and 2 friends were walking thru one of the stores at   Six Flags Over Georgia   and they had a lil   "  CAUTION:WET FLOOR"   yellow sign thingy out that sits on the floor and I was like "I bet you a million bucks the floor's not even wet now! Watch!" and went running toward the sign....I&nbsp;crashed into a buncha Powerpuff Girl beanie babies. There were stains from the floor on my khaki shorts.....  *sigh*   Another day in the life of stupid me. People call me blonde, but most of my blonde friends are smart. Accept maybe Maya...But that's probally cuz she's always on something all the time..  jk, jk!!   *looks around nervously*    cool, bold. Orange Bold...Or Bold Orange.. Which one sounds right?  Have you ever had an itch on your right leg...and when your done scratching it, you scratch your left leg too, just to have things even....or am I the only one? I have a friend, online, who was told if you gargle paroxide it will make your teeth whiter. When she did it her gums also turned white. Being the idiot that she is, she panicked and drank red Kool-Aid to turn her gums back pink. Needless to say her newly whitened teeth were also red...wow. Something even stupider that happened to me..Well, that I did. Me and some friends went to the mall and I was checking out some clothes near the dressing room and I glanced over and thought I'd seen a girl with the same outfit as me on...I didn't want to stare, and make her think I was a freak, so I leaned over to my friend and was like "I think that girl has the same outfit on as me, just don't stare." So, she glanced over real quick and looked back at me, then her brow arched and she looked back at the girl, while I'm freaking out "Don't look, don't look!" and she rolled her eyes and said "Kristen, i think that's a mirror." Man, That was one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my life....   *sigh*  &nbsp; When I was about 6 or 7, me and my parents were over my grandparents house..visiting. Every time we went, I always went on a scavenger hunt cuz they have the weirdest, coolest, most ancient things in their house. I went to go play dress up one day and I think my parents had left, leaving my grandparents to babysit me..I put on lipstick, gma's old jewelry, high-heels...I was looking around for perfume...Couldn't find any, so I decided to go thru my gma's purse, and found a lil spray bottle. It looked like perfume to me, so I sprayed it on with my eyes closed..and when I was all done, I opened my eyes to go look in the mirror again and I   SCREAMED BLOODY MURDER...   I ran out into the living room and both my gparents came running. I still had the bottle in my hand and gave it back to my gma and tried to explain through tears that I was trying to smell pretty like her and she looked at the bottle and smiled at me, she gave it to&nbsp;my gpa and I could see him *almost* laugh at it..I was like "Why is it funny!?" and she hugged me tight and said, "Honey, that wasn't perfume you tried to spray... It's mace. ......At least it was when I was 6, and not now that I'm alot older... Anyway, why is it that when most ppl are being stared at, they freak out and liek every 5 seconds, they get the urge to stare back to see if the other person's still looking at them? And if they are, the other person usually&nbsp;looks away real fast pretending that they weren't just staring at the other person? It's a never-ending thing, the both of them looking back and forth. Sometimes it starts fight...It's quite amusing. Do they stare and if caught, be like "Darn, I was caught! Billy, Billy! I was just caught!" and Billy says "Oh no! Man down, man down!!! He's been caught, seeking medical attention! Bob? Bob, can you hear me, man? How many fingers am I holding up?" lolz, that's a cute lil thing Jojo came up with the other day. WBL. Oh yeah, go  urlLink here . To read about what happened with Cindy last night. :P~~~ PeAsH!!

       Tomorrow's Bulk Pick Up, so me and Jojo went out walkin earlier and found a couple of A/C's and a steering wheel cover. It's Winnie The Pooh, but it's torn, so I wear it as a necklace. It's adorable, lolz. Later, His mom and 2 brothers joined us to get the A/C's and we went around looking for more stuff. Looking.... Looking...Looking... Couldn't find anything, so we went to the trailer park behind us (Forgot what it's called, grr) and hit the jackpot. It looked like either somone got evicted, or hit the lottery and just left alotta junk behind. I got like, 7 stuffed animals for myself (gave one to Cameron), and got 2 dolls for Kimberly. Thank God we went then, cuz it just POURED...and harshly poured. It rained so hard, it hailed. Not a normal thing for Florida residents..at least not down in South Florida...Well, anyway, I found out today that I don't think I could possibly call Cindy my best friend again. Heard some things that I didn't ever think she'd say about me. Wow. Best friends for life... Angel ~N~ Sexi.....RIP, Forever.I wonder what it'll be next. Maybe nothing.Look at what Shawn wrote me:   lilzonex187: your life would make a good movie   krazednkonfuzled: lolz, shut up&nbsp;    lilzonex187: dont stop its like a movie and i know whats about to happen   lilzonex187: next   &nbsp; Well, that's Shawn for ya. Big Teddybear Bodyguard. I got Renee' to sign up for livejournal too. Awesomeness... That should make a good one.I'm gonna go outside...I think. And see if Jojo's out there..TTYL, Peash Ouzz!!!! XxO, XxO, xXo, xXo, Which do you prefer?? Big or Small?~~~~~KrIsTeN~~~~~ :p~~~~~~~

       Hey, sorry I forgot to write yesterday, I kept meaning to, but every time I got on, I got flooded by IM's on MSN, Yahoo, and AIM. Mostly new people from gp4. Their all pretty cool, all of them. I love meeting new people, so it's all good. Remeber the whole Maya thing? Where me and her were walking around the neighborhood together?Now Cindy's mad at me and she can't even look at me without making a face. She thing is she went over to talk to Maya and was telling her all sorts of crud about this, I'd imagine. I actually can't really say that tho. I have no idea if it's true or not. I wouldn't doubt it tho. I was talking to Jojo and telling him how I didn't like being hated and he said "She's always mad at everyone. She's even mad at me right now." So I said "Why would she be mad at you? You didn't do anything". And he said "I dunno. She said just stay out of my way". I should've saved the convo, man. It was on AIM. He said he was used to it and I said that we shouldn't be. The line "She's mad at everyone." referring to Cindy, I've heard many times from MANY different people. Another one of my closer friends, Stephen has said she's not a real best friend, or even friend for that matter if she's like that. He wrote this to me in a note. {1.)Stephen- Guy from church. I've known him even longer than I've known Marissa. He's a PK(Preachers/Pastors Kid). He's one of my favorite people to hang around...I dunno if I'd tell him that tho..He's already big-headed enough... :P~~~) Other people have told me about the same thing. Different words, but the same thing. People did that same thing with Jojo and I tho, and me and him made it through it, so I figured that Cindy and I could too.....But it's really not seeming to work.Having a chick as a best friend...Really doesn't seem to work for me. They either get possessive....a jealous type, leave me for their boyfriend....every b/f they get, or they just get cruel. What the flip am I doing WRONG!?I get was too emo about this kinda stuff, cuz I always want to be cool with everyone. I don't want any enemies. I guess, sometimes I have to have them tho. When Marissa got to be a big problem..I got so mad..that I finally took it out on her. Big time. Then, while I was expecting the worst, she told me how proud she was that I'd finally stood up to her. But, we still weren't best friends, and things were odd for a while. But I'd stood up to her, just like Renee'd told me to. {2>)Renee'- The greatest kuzin a kuzin could have. 8 months older than me, I think. So, I'm STILL the jit kuzin, but she helps me to understand life. One of my Life Tutors. We fight like absolute crazy tho, sometimes. But, she's worth it. I love her.} About 2 years ago, I think. Renee'd come to visit us down here. Marissa was being crabby, (not the word I want to use, but, you get it) as usual and Renee just about slapped me because I did everything Marissa said. i was like her little slave. Seriously. She could've told me to jump off a cliff....no, I wouldn't quite do that but you get the point...Marissa and I had a sleepover just this week and we both had the time of our lives remembering old times. It was awesome. We'd admitted that we'd missed eachother like krazy. She is ONE of my best friends. I don't want to finalize anymore, no #1's on it. If there was a #1, it'd be Jojo, and he's a guy. Guys are cool. Girls aren't. Altho I am one...Some girls...grr, I hate some girls.. I dunno what's gonna happen today, it's only 10:30 in the morning. All heck could break loose, for all I know. Not expecting anything quite yet. WBL.

       &nbsp;Man, what the heck? This is my first day back from Marissa's and I'm SO SORE!! We walked alot, but it's not even my legs, it's my back and arms.. Lawrence carried me some of the way back to Marissa's and it was putting a bit of stress on my arms, but I dunno if that's why. It's the only thing I can think of... Anyway...Cody came by today to visit Cindy.. We all hung down at the laundry mat. Jojo was there too, or I probally would've bored myself to death. Hmm, I'm naming all these people you people dunno, so... let's see here...{1.)Cindy- My best friend...or supposed to be...let's just call her one of my best friends. My girlfriend. LoLz.}{2.)Jojo- My ex bf, still the love of my life tho..Another best friend..and he's MINE!! All mine....}{3.)Cody- One of many of Cindy's bf's..well, ex bf's. Just a friend. Altho he text messages and calls me. Yet, he's like 5 yrs older than I am.. Well, 3 or 4. Maybe 5.}{4.)Marissa- My, I guess you'd call her my ex best friend.. my wifee. She's still one of my best friends, we go waaaaaay back...}{5.)Lawrence- One of Matthew's friends, Marissa's ex. He's got a g/f from what I've heard, but I don't know her, He should bring her to church sometime.}Ah, yes...And church...where everything began...Many people would probally read this and be like "Yeah, church...*Sigh* Boring ol' church. Church sux" But nooo, not mine. Our youth group's the stuff... :P~~~ yes, I said "the stuff", cuz I don't cuss, used to...REAL BAD...Ask Marissa, lolz, but now, I don't see any point in it. It's stupid, really. Alot of ppl think I'm crazy for it, yeah. I am. But my friends...my REAL friends.. They stuck with me after I gave up all that crud.hey, whatever. ANYway.... Me and Marissa got bored at her house, so we decided to go to Matts. He wasn't home at first so we went by Lawrence and Shannon's house, didn't knock or anything, she was just showing me where they lived {6.)Shannon- Lawrence's younger brother. He doesn't come to church as often as Shannon does or anything, but I know him enough to play around and joke with him. }. After we past their house...after being honked at about 5 million times, we went to Fashion Cent and looked at a buncha clothes there.Then, Marissa called Matthew again and he answered this time. She told him that we were comming over and he said it might not be such a good idea to come over because Chalind was going to be comming over too. Plus, Shawn was there. {7.) Chalind- Another guy, met thru Matthew. Reminds me of a teddy bear.} {8.) Shawn- Yet another guy met thru Matthew. He's like a teddy bear too, cept he's more of a big scary bodyguard teddybear..if you can picture that...}. Well, I had to talk to Matthew and tell him that I hated that Chalind was mad at me...It didn't seem right. He's never been mad at me before...Whatever. We went anyway, I wanted to make up with Chalind. He's goin out with Tatiana now, I heard. {9.)Tatiana- Another chick from church I've known for a while... She just recently came back for VBS at church..Didn't see her after that..}. We got there, yadda yadda yadda.....Played video games while Marissa and Matt were in his room and junk. Lawrence kept whoopin up on me and Shawn in Dead or Alive..We won like 3 times, big whoop. But, hey whatever, had to go home and All 3 of the guys decided to walk us home. Lawrence decided he wanted to carry me...His mistake..Or so I thought. He carried my big behind to the park. Then, Shawn was talkin some junk about me gettin married or somethin.. So, I got bothered and told him to tell me who I was supposed to be getting married to, and he said "Remember, you said how bout I (I forgot what he said here) yadda yadda yadda, and I said how bout I meet you at the chapel instead?" So obviously implying He said he was gonna marry me...or something.. Well, anyway, got back to Marissa's .... yadda yadda yadda... Alena was gonna drive me home and Marissa up to her step mama's house...She decided to tell Shawn, Matt, and Lawrence to hop in the car so she could give them a ride back to Matt's too...*sigh*. 4 of us (From Left to Right-Matthew, Marissa, Me, Lawrence) Thank God Shawn wasn't in the back seat...of that lil Honda. I was tryin so hard to get on Marissa's lap, ended up on Lawrence's instead. Felt so bad, cuz he's got a g/f, and I've got Jojo. It felt..dirty...is that wrong? Yadda yadda yadda, everything else went smoothly...I never want to sit on his lap again tho, lolz. I'll stick with Jojo's.I got home and went outside after tennis, heard that Jojo went with Frank and his Mom (Franks Mom, that is). I was like "Wait a minute, he wanted me to meet him when I got home, why would he go out?" Whatever. Bobby told me he saw them leave. {10.Frank- One of my neighborhood friends... Big guy, Love him tho, he likes my teams,he's one of my big bro's..Rock on!!} {11.)Bobby- Rather weird neighborhood friend...Big blue eyes..man, can't really explain him. He's sweet, but never....Never.} Even Matthew and Christopher told me Jojo had left with Frank and his Mom, so I just gave up {12.)Matthew and Christopher- Brothers of Jojo and Cindy. Their awesome. It's cool cuz both of their b-day's are on March 1, yet their a year apart. Matthew's 9, Christopher's 8, heh..} Me and Bobby were walkin down the street, met up with Maya...and with her, was the lil brat...Max. {13.)Maya- Friend from skool, Love her ta death, I own her, she owns me..It's all good...She's a giggle-ball} {14.)Max-Lil brat..he's like, 8 or 9.. Threw my CareBear over the fence. EVIL lil kid, lolz.} Bobby left, I walked with Max and Maya, walked Max home, found out that his lil 5 yr old bro, Brandon was missing.{15.)Brandon- One of the cutest lil kids in the world!!! I dunno what happened to his 15 yr old bro, Brett, He doesn't look like him at all...} So, we went out lookin for lil ol Brandon, yadda yadda yadda...walkin around the whole neighborhood...lookin for him.. Walked Max back home, they'd found Brandon. I get a text from Jojo for me to come outside... Here's me.. thinking "Wait a minute, when'd he get home?" Then, here comes Bobby around the corner, "Jojo wants you". So, I raced Bobby to him and Jojo said "So, I heard you were at Chiko's." WWWWHHHHAAAAATTTTT...but I only said that in my head.. Started a big fight...yadda yadda yadda...We got over it...about 10 minutes later... Mom was gettin paranoid again, probally thinkin I was outside alone with Jojo.....*clears throat*.. which I was, but that's beside the point..Frank came later. Hmmm, I think that's about it. Me and Mom got in a fight about Gay ppl. Said since we're christian's we shouldn't accept it or something. Said she used to be gay/bi, whatever, and that the topic was something she felt strong about. Said I should hate the fact that their gay, not them. I'll have to get more info on that now...Whatever...Not sure how to feel about it all. Anyway..That ends my night, I guess. I'm gonna hurt Brent...Really.`'`'`'`'`'`'`'I told you I write alot...'`'`'`'`'`'`'`'`'`'`:P~~~~~~~*~KrIsTeN~*~xxo, XXO, xxo, XXO, Which do you prefer? Big, or Small??????

       Why can't some people keep some comments to theirselves?       A certain person kinda bashed what I thought was cute, dunno why it got me so...catty, (you know, how their hairs on their backs raise..?) but it did. It annoys me SO MUCH. sheesh. At least be joking around...but if your not...I really don't need it. I doubt anyone does, you know? LoLz, I'm not really upset, just annoyed. But, hey...it's all good....           It's like Christbashers....ALOT of them come into the CHRISTIAN chat room and they start talking parc.. I'm just like... "Hello!!!! There are rooms for the whole "f this, f that, Jesus sux" type of thing. Make your own Athiest room or somethin!!! Sheesh!! Sometimes, I  don't  FEEL LIKE ARGUING!!! SO GO AWAY!!!!          Sometimes I just wanna sit back and chill. Have a nice clean convo about....cheese or something.          Which reminds me, no cheese SO ruined my morning. It sucked. I was just like "What, no cheese?" and then Grandma told me to go digging in the stand up freezer, so I did and saw NO CHEESE. She insisted that it was there tho, and I was just like "Whatever" lolz. I didn't like my food cuz I wanted a piece of cheese on my egg in an egg sandwich and cheese in my grits. It didn't taste right. Not even the bacon tasted right. It was so freaky. Then, later, I walked in the house and Grandma was like "I found the cheese in this freezer, it wasn't in the other one." I was just like........................................................................................ *sigh* and stuff........My n Daddy are goin on l8r to get some stuff. Hey, I got this webcam thingy working on the computer. It's thru the camcorder tho, so it's weird. It turns off every 5 minutes or so. I wanted to throw it across the room. But, I wouldn't do that.         This musik on TV sounds like FBI. What am I talking about? I mean, The X-Files. Great.     Last night was Friday Night Fire and First Baptist Church of Cooper City. It was awesome. I'm disappointed in Stephen tho cuz he was supposed to do both of the rap parts in Jesus Freak and he ditched talking about he stubbed his toe at home and twisted his ankle or something up in Orlando. He didn't wanna go in the first place tho, he said it. I was like "Then why did you even come to the practice, why didn't you tell us earlier that you didn't wanna be in this?" and he was like "I did!" I was just like "No, you didn't."                     There goes my Secretary vote for  Kaetlyn. She had a speech and everything. I think she has it. Stephen's never here most of the time anyway, I could never depend on him for like.. anything really. He says he'll be there....he doesn't show up, why? Because he was too tired, he stubbed his toe, he has to go to a friends barmizvah, what's next? I had to go feed my pet monkey. That's something he'd probally say, too. I love him, yeah. He's like another brother to me, but........ he's too bizzy to be secretary, or at least, I think so. He's got an awesome future ahead of him and obvioulsy more important things to do, so.....hey! It's all good!!                     Matt and I sang the 2 rap parts in Jesus Freak and both songs went well. We sand "Jesus Freak" and "He Reigns". When I sand my rap part, these people to the side of me were chanting "Go! Go! Go! Go!" It was so funny! :P                    Everyone had so much fun. We all danced around when the other ppl were rapping and junk. It was crazy. But awesome.                  Hey, all who read this, you guys, COMMENT IN MY BLOG!! I wanna see stuff, questions, anything you want me to write on.........ANYTHING. Tell me how dumb my posts are, or how funny, how long, annoying, short, interesting. Whatever you choose. Anyway, I'm gonna goes now.. See if there's anyone outside to hang out with. B Byeness!!!!!!!!!                º~*KrIsTeN*~º   xXo, XxO!!! Which do you prefer??? Big Or Small!?!?!? :P
