      I stirred and looked at the clock. Half past 6 on the clock. Another busy day. I put feet down, bent down to touch my feet. A morning routine of warming up before i started my daily chores. I went out of the room and closed the door quietly behind my back. The air outside was cool and humid, like every day. I checked the lock on the door. Locked, as i had last night. I slowly passed the kitchen, to the bathroom for a wash up.  I switched on the water boiler, sat on the living room couch . Am coughed in the next room. His cough was getting worse. Should i send him to school or not? Better not I'll take him to the doctor, I decided.

But hey, he didn't even bother asking me...or caring when i had my operation. Then again, was he guarding my privacy?? O WHO CARES!!
