        Any relationship can be wonderful, enlightening, exciting... and terrifying.&nbsp; As relationships have unfolded in my life I have determined that there are two essential dimensions to all relationships:&nbsp; Responsibility &amp; Vulnerability.&nbsp; These may sound like a pessimistic or cynical way of viewing connection... I have often been accused of being both a pessimist and a cynic... but I have my reasons.&nbsp; The truth is that these dimensions, for me, encompass the good &amp; the bad that come from entwining your life with another. &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Responsibility     &nbsp;  We all have a grocery list a mile long of responsibilities.&nbsp; Many of these items we have chosen to take on, while others such as acquiring food and water are dictated by biology.&nbsp; It seems to me that&nbsp;some of these &nbsp;"chosen" responsibilities are added to our lists simply because we have opted to involve others in our lives.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You see... once you connect your life with another... you directly affect that individual.&nbsp; I truly believe that all of our thoughts and actions affect all other beings in some way, but when it comes to those we know more intimately... they endure the brunt of the force.&nbsp; This can be a wonderful thing regardless of the nature of the blow:  &nbsp;  "Shared joy is double joy. Shared sorrow is half sorrow."&nbsp;&nbsp;( urlLink Swedish Proverb )&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  This responsibility&nbsp;can also make life challenging.&nbsp; How can I possibly act if I am to take into account the ramifications of my actions for all&nbsp; others and try to make their experiences on this earth positive?&nbsp; This task becomes even more daunting when I stop to think that those most affected by my thoughts and actions are those that I care the most about.  &nbsp;  *** A small side note:&nbsp; I was involved in drama once upon a time, and performed a monologue that I absolutely loved from a no-name play in the early nineties.&nbsp; The character was reciting a suicide note to his parents and begins to argue the merits of the following statement: "Suicide is a selfish act".&nbsp; I can't help but think of this when&nbsp; I think of the responsibility of connection.&nbsp; The reason suicide is a selfish act, is precisely because the second you allow another individual to enter your life... your decisions directly affect them.&nbsp; While you may be escaping pain, you are forcing them into pain with that same act.&nbsp; And because they have allowed you into their lives... they have no choice in the matter... you dictate their pain.***  &nbsp;  So connection brings with it a responsibility to those we have connected with.&nbsp; The responsibility of considering them in our decisions on a daily basis.&nbsp; This is a huge undertaking which makes me wonder how we can go about our lives making these connections as if it's nothing.  &nbsp;   Vulnerability   &nbsp;  I would like to venture that the reason we attach ourselves to others in spite of the immense responsibility is that we want to become vulnerable.&nbsp; This may seem odd as vulnerability is defined as being susceptible to injury or attack.&nbsp; While this is an entirely valid definition (more later)&nbsp;I would like to suggest that only when we allow ourselves to become vulnerable, do we open ourselves, completely, to all of the wonderful things another being can bring into our lives.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's hard to experience love, true affection, devotion, selflessness, sincerity, or truth without first making oneself vulnerable.&nbsp; This is why we seek attachment... in the hopes that each relationship will provide something new and life-changing an experience that makes us feel alive and provides a catalyst for continuing to expose ourselves to the possibility of pain.  &nbsp;  This is the the side of becoming vulnerable... the pain.&nbsp; When we tie our lives so closely to others we open up venues for hurt that don't exist otherwise.&nbsp; We can experience pain as a result of their actions, both intentional and unintentional.&nbsp; We can set ourselves up to hurt when they hurt, and mourn when they mourn.&nbsp; I don't know if I have experienced anything more physically painful than watching someone I love experience hurt.&nbsp; That is a scary place to enter into and a decision that is often made so lightly.  &nbsp;  Yes.... relationships can be wonderful, enlightening, exciting... and absolutely terrifying.  &nbsp;  How are we to know what we are delving into?

       Why is it that we can feel so overwhelmed by everything we have to do... and then when we finally sit down to do it... it takes only a moment?

       Until yesterday, the word "Blog" was entirely foreign to me. To think that there are people out there sharing their thoughts - and as a result, their lives. While I used to be an avid journaler, I've found I need an audience to truly explore what's going on in my life. My most recent outlet has been a new found prison penpal. While his entrance into my life has raised some eyebrows, I can't tell you how wonderful it is to have a waiting audience... eager to hear from me at any time about anything. The freedom found in an open audience is immense and exciting. Perhaps blogging will provide another venue for this new found freedom...

       Three more days of classes…  Change is inevitable, and really the only thing that is ever constant. This, however, doesn’t make change any easier or less exhausting. It’s hard to ever know what’s coming just around the bend or to be even the slightest bit prepared for whatever that might be.  I tend to concern myself a great deal about the future. I spend time worrying about what’s ahead and sometimes forget to enjoy what’s now. At this moment, I find myself in this same, all too familiar predicament. In the next month:  JB will move back to Alaska – and I will be alone in my house once again…  I will get new neighbors – I love my current neighbors and don’t know who will take their place…  I will go home and spend time with friends and family – it will be hard to leave again…  Summer session will end – I love this group of kids and am sad to see them go…  Fall semester will begin – new students, new seminars, new office, new colleagues…  JB’s move provides a new “situation” – how will we define “us”? …  Change is necessary. It is frightening and exciting. The anticipation is what kills me… causes me to ignore the experiences of today and spend my time and energy trying to prepare for change… inevitable… constant… unpredictable…. Change.
