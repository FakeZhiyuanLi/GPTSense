      Well, today was certainly interesting. Me and Alyson met Tony and went and saw "The Village" which was amazing. I thought that it would be kind of campy from the beginning, but the movie got really good and it turned out to have one wicked twist. We saw Sarah today...at the movies. Today really proved to me that things between us will never be the same. First of all, she didn't even notice me and Alyson sitting outside the movie theater, waiting for Tony, until I said something. Then, she didn't even bother to stop and talk, but rather walked on by and had nothing to do with me. Afterwards, we talked for like five minutes, but it was a wasted effort. She didn't want to talk to me at all. You know, I at least tried to be friendly, tried to show that I could be the better person, just as Alyson did, but it was all fucking useless. I don't know why I bother trying to be friends with her...it's like trying to be friends with a fucking brick wall. She can talk to me on the internet and email me, but she doesn't want to be near me in real life. What kind of friendship is that? There is none anymore. The next time I talk to her, whenever I decide to, I'm going to tell her that I quit the coven. I can't handle being linked to her when she doesn't even want to acknowledge my existence in front of her friends who she seems to like better than me anyways. Makes me fucking sick.  ~With this knife I'll cut out the part of me, the part that cares for you~ -Smile Empty Soul "With this Knife"

      Have you ever just hated someone, hated them so much that it drained everything you have and left you feeling empty and cold? That's how I feel right about now about my parents...I'm not used to playing this whole "backseat to what I want" thing. Lately, all my parents do is go out and spend their money on drinking at Ya Ya's...not even seeming to care that we are sitting here waiting. Why is it always about what they want? I mean, they can't even fucking take responsibility for their own kids. It seems like all the kids in my generation have parents who, plainly put, just don't give a fuck, and then they wonder why we're all so fucked up in the head. They wonder why their kids kill themselves, or cut, or start doing drugs and drinking...it's all just to kill the pain. My mom has even started doing it...she was always home and always there, but now...she would rather stay up there at that fucking bar then come home so we can eat. Money got shitted down the hole to pay for their bar tab, and they wonder why I keep getting depressed. I have to worry about whether my younger brother is going to eat dinner that night, and whether or not I'm just going to decide to cut and get it over with. Every time this happens, I start thinking back to when my dad was the one gone and my mom was home...now, I have to put up with my dad staying home and bitching about my mom getting drunk...that is, when the both of them aren't out. I have no life, no freedom...it's like I'm trapped being the adult and they're the fun loving teenagers who don't have to worry about it. My mom drowns her depression in alcohol...why should that be any different from me dragging a razor blade across my skin? My parents just can't see it...every time this happens I die a little more, another bit of myself rotting and falling away. Makes me wonder...would they notice if I just left...or died? I don't think any of the parents of our generation would... they are too busy wrapped up in their own lives to worry about us. It doesn't matter if we're screaming, bleeding, or dying...all that matters is that they're having a good time. Fuck that. Fuck that and fuck them. And by the way, mom and dad...fuck you too.

      Today was an awesome day. Alyson and I got the day to ourselves, and we finally went to the tea room like we've been wanting to and I might be able to get a job there! I would love having a job there...the atmosphere is great and the people are really nice. Also, I might be getting my mom's car to drive when school starts, so I'll actually have a car! I&nbsp;can't wait! I want to drive to school so bad, and I'm thinking about taking short day so I'll get to spend more time with Alyson during school time. I'm not really looking forward to starting school, but at the same time I am because I'm finally going to be a senior. One more year of high school...that's absolutely insane. I remember going into junior high and thinking I was cool. Now look at me.  We also went and saw Gwen and baby Grace. She's so precious...makes me want one. Hopefully one day I will be able to have a baby with the person I love the most. *looks at Alyson* Things will be great...I just know it. Going to go see&nbsp;a movie tomorrow with Tony...it'll be nice to see him as well as everyone else. I miss our little group of friends, and Tony is going to be going to the Louisiana school...so he won't even be there. Things change so much. It just amazes me is all. Well, off to bed or if I can't sleep like always, I'll write something. I can't wait until me and Alyson get the site going...it'll be great!  ~The more things change, the more they stay the same~  -Someone I can't remember at this present time.

         Why does it have to hurt so much? I mean, I just can't do anything right for anyone it seems as of late...either that or I just have too much on my plate. My parents...god, they are so fucking irresponsible...my dad can't even get a job to support us because he just wants to lay around all day. At least, I want to get a job and want to be able to support myself at least a little. I might be getting a car soon, and if they keep pissing their money away, I need a way to pay for gas. I don't know...things are just getting so complicated. I'm talking to Sarah again, but Alyson doesn't like it...and she's talking to Kat again, and I don't like it. Round and round we go, where we stop nobody knows. She got mad at me for talking to Mick and Mary...which the other night Mick scared me a bit. She kept telling me about how I should run away with her...made me very uncomfortable. I didn't really know what to do or say... *sighs* Maybe I was overreacting...I don't know though...it didn't feel like I was. I really don't know what to think...about much of anything anymore.   ~You just can't see you're killing me, can you?~  -Me

      What happens when your girlfriend stops wanting you to touch her? I sure as hell don't...Alyson keeps saying how she wants to start back from the beginning, which I do too, but...she won't even let me touch as in lay a hand on her or cuddle...fuck, she doesn't even seem like she wants me to kiss her anymore. It sounds (in reality) like she doesn't want me anymore...like's she grown so bored with me and doesn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me the truth. She keeps saying that she doesn't want to rush things, and that she's not ready for sex, which I respect and can understand...I want to wait because I want her to be ready and to be happy, but...I can't take her pulling away. Earlier, she laid in my arms with no problem but all of a sudden tonight she doesn't want me to touch her. God, what if she doesn't want me anymore? I love Alyson more than anything else in the world, but lately...it doesn't seem to me like she feels the same way. She's been flirting more with Mary, and when I say something about it she acts like she doesn't know what I am talking about. If she wants to fucking break up, I wish she would just come out with it instead of doing this...neither of us are going to be able to handle it for much longer. I don't like not being able to kiss...the fucking sex I could live without, but touching her and kissing her...I can't take not being able to do that. I don't know what to think anymore...hot cold hot cold. She's acting like Tony did when I was trying to get him to date me...and she critisized him for it for hours and hours...even after I stopped liking him. I just...don't know anymore. I hate being unsure, but...unsure is what I am. I just know...that I don't like being played with and it needs to stop. ~You've stolen too much of me...I'm through with being used"  -JTHM

      Wow...I don't remember the last time that I was up this late and not falling down tired. I just got offline...was talking to some sucky ass rpers...I hate it when they don't know how to spell. Anyway...I got so mad today...I mean, I can't believe what Alyson's mom did...she just acted like it was no big deal that her car was potentially dangerous and could kill the both of us if it goes wrong. I hate seeing Alyson that upset...sometimes...I wish I could just take all of her pain away...let her be free of all of the shit that her mom puts her through. I mean, I love her more than anything and I hate seeing her get treated like that by her mom. Her mom just doesn't understand how to be a parent...not that I would be any better, mind you, but I least I have the sense to know that if I can't take care of a kid then I shouldn't have them. Alyson keeps saying what a burden she is on my family, but really she isn't. My mom and dad really do like having her around the house...especially my mom. On the lighter side of things, I finally got to talk to Nurah today...she said that we might be able to hang out. Tomorrow, while Alyson's at work...I think I'm going to try and call Kacie finally. I just don't have any time anymore and I feel really bad about it...hopefully she can come back over sometime soon and we can hang out again. As for Sarah...I don't know if I'm ready to call and actually talk to her...I actually put up the nerve to email her and IM her, just like Alyson did with Kat. She keeps telling me "SInce you're talking to Sarah,it's only fair..." But just l like she tells me, it's my decision to put myself through that. I don't know why I do...still haven't quite figured it out yet.. but like I said before...I don't think that I ever will.  ~So kill me with the love, that you won't give to me~ -Smile Empty Soul&nbsp; "For You"

      Today was fun...Micheal came over and we watched movies, but once again, H* flaked out. She said that she had to go to work, but both A* and I were looking forward to seeing her again. That...and I can't believe that I let myself talk to S* as long as I did...I mean, what the hell is wrong with me? I'm such a sucker for punishment...our conversation was so empty and fake...nothing like the friendship we used to have. It hurts so much...I mean, one minute I want to be friends with her again and make everything go back to the way it was and the next I want to tell her that I hate her and never want to speak to her again...I don't know anymore. The only person I can really depend on anymore is A*. She always comes through for me, especially when I need her the most. I can't say that for S* anymore. I don't know when I'm going to be able to tell her that I quit her coven...I guess the same time I can tell her that I don't want to put up with her lies and I tell her not to talk to me anymore. *sighs to herself* I guess that's like A* with her problems with people...I don't even want to go into that... *sighs again* I don't know...I guess I'll figure it out one of these days.  ~People equal shit~  -Slipknot "People Equal Shit"

      I am sitting at the library...using the internet since the disk for mine hasn't come in yet. *sighs* Alas, we are not to have internet. Almost finished with the third season of Buffy...now I want to get the fourth season so that I can continue with my new obsession. Got an email from Sarah today...wrote her back and actually gave her my phone number. Sometimes I wonder if I am just a sucker for her punishment, but letting go is so hard...I don't know what to do. Completely unrelated, went to the Sevendust concert...for all those who read this journal...LAIJON WITHERSPOON (lead singer of Sevendust) IS A TOTAL AND COMPLETE ASSHOLE! DO NOT ASK FOR AN AUTOGRAPH OR A PICTURE...IT IS A WASTE OF TIME! I mean, I went to see Linkin Park and they were so cool, and Alyson said that when she went to see Kittie, they were cool too. All I wanted was a fucking picture! Alyson and I had a fight the other day and it cleared the air for a final time, I think. We're still going to have our spats, but no more fights. I don't know if I wrote about it last time, but we had one really bad one that almost cost us our relationship. But, this one made us both realize that things have changed and it was all because of the 3some with E*...which both of us have decided that it never happened, and the sex is better and so is everything else. We've started writing sweet notes to each other and we've been falling back into the way things used to be...not exactly the way they used to be, but close enough...which is all that matters. ~Now that you love me, I love myself...I never thought I would say that...I never thought there would be you~  -"You" by Evanescence.

      Today is the 4th...whoppee. I don't see what the big deal is, but everyone else does. The only good part about the 4th is the fireworks...blowing stuff up makes everything more fun. Got those water dynamite things... god I love those. Anyway, watched the fireworks last night, don't feel like watching them tonight. Today was fun, we swam and ate like pigs. That makes life so fun. I can't wait until this Sunday coming up...I get to go see Sevendust in concert! WOOT WOOT! ALL PRAISE ME! Okay, so it's not that big of a deal to most, but I find it to be something to get excited about for me. Things with Alyson have been a lot better since we've worked out the whole computer deal...but that's really all I have to say about that. Not much else to say at all...really...I guess that means it's time to go. ~Every new beginning is some other beginning's end~  -Semisonic, "Closing Time"

      I am finding that staring at a computer screen for too long causes one to become increasingly exhausted...not that I already wasn't. Had to get up and go to driver's ed at 7 00 this morning, which was a bitch and a half. It was boring, but I did manage to pass with a 92. It wasn't that hard, just really boring. And the creepy guy in the back row that wouldn't stop staring at me...he was one of those that you can't help but feel staring at you. Urg...I hate people like that. Talked to Heather&nbsp;for the first time in forever...and emailed Sarah. I was expecting a bitch-out, but...strangely, she didn't sound that bitchy. I have a feeling that a lot of bridges were burned between the two of us, but I guess neither of us wants to admit it to the other. So much has happened...I don't even really know where to begin when it comes to those two. Heather&nbsp;seems like she really wants to make things better after what she did...mostly to Alyson&nbsp;but, still...I had to be there to pick up the pieces of that. I didn't mind, but it still...made me angry. Sarah and I will never be the same...no matter what. ~You've stolen too much of me...I'm through with being used~  -JTHM

      I cannot believe what I, of all people, just did. We(meaning Alyson&nbsp;and I) just set up her webcam and put on a show for a bunch of hornball guys in a chatroom. Tonight, we might go a bit farther and show a bit more. I do have to admit...it was a bit of an egoboost hearing guys talk about how they like my tits. I never thought anyone other than Alyson would. She still hasn't written the part of our collaboration...she keeps putting it off. It's kind of making me angry because she wouldn't leave me the fuck alone when I didn't want to write, but I did anyway. I hate it when she does that...I mean, it bothers me when I have to do what she wants right then or she pouts, but I'm not allowed to do the same thing when it comes to what I want her to do. I don't know...that makes me angry sometimes. Other than that, life is great. Except for the fact that my dad is coming home tonight...I really don't want that. Anyway, that's all for now, I guess.

      There's nothing to really talk about yet...I mean, other than this will be a lot easier than the damn Numb journal at LPC. Last night was scary and nice all at the same time. Alyson and I talked about what needed to be said, and it made everything a lot easier. I really like it when we have those talks...the ones that clear the air, even though they tend to scare the shit out of me. But all is right in the world now...at least in my happy world. New Kittie and Otep CDs are coming out... go and check them out or else itchy pants of doom shall be rained upon all those who do not obey me. OBEY THE FIST! I think that's enough for now.

      Amazing how so many lies can just keep building and building huh? My mother still has yet to call Diane about my fucking car, which means that I won't have it by Monday like she PROMISED. I am so fucking tired of people breaking their promises. You should't fucking make them if you can't keep them. I mean, they KNOW I need this car to get to school, and to be able to get a job and such...I NEED it. But no...it's the same fucking bullshit. All they want to do is to do what they want to do. It doesn't matter to my mom and dad whether or not my brother and I have what we need...just as long as they get to have fun and do what they want to do. When I have kids, I am going to make sure that they have everything they need, and that I am going to do my best not to fuck my kids up like my parents did me. I mean, give me a break. I am a 17 year old girl that sits at her house all the time, unable to go anywhere or do anything that other 17 years old get to do because she is stuck babysitting and her parents like to keep it that way. What the hell are they going to do when I go off the college? When I move out? I sure as hell am not coming back to babysit for them...fuck that. I practically raise my brother, since I am the only one home enough to do anything with him. And then...there's something else that's been bothering me, but I didn't want to say it where Alyson could read, even though she wouldn't. My parents said that they think its time for her to move out of our house. I don't see why it should matter...they say it's because of financial stuff, but my dad has an opportunity with his music. My mom said she was going to talk to her, but she has yet to do that too. I didn't want to say anything because I knew it would upset Alyson something horrible. They still don't understand...they think that now her and her mom are getting along that if she moves back in, things are going to be pink bunnies and rainbows...they don't know that Alyson's going to get worse again because of it. I mean, we're kind of doing our own thing now, but...still. I love being able to come home from where ever I am and see Alyson sitting on the bed, waiting for me. And vice versa. Why do they want to take that from me? I have been so much happier since Alyson moved in with us, and she is like the only friend I have left. She means the world to me, and I don't know what I would do if I couldn't be with her all the time like I have been. It's just not fair. But...neither one of them has said anything to her or me, so I guess that means the plans were put on hold. Good. I don't want them to say anything. ~Tell me all your fucking lies/ Cause I/will make you eat your words and die~ -Ill Nino

      I have finally realized...what a dumbass I have been. Today was the first day of school, and what I soon learned would be the beginning of a lot of changes. The biggest was with Lenny and Alyson, but that will come later. Meanwhile...Sarah. That stupid fucking no good shit of a whore. (Gods I feel better) I tried to be nice...tried to at least say one nice thing and she blew off, not that I should be surprised, which I'm really not. Then, something rather amusing happened...Sarah can't even qualify to be a senior because she faked all those grades and look where it got her. I thought I was going to laugh at her...out loud anyway. I think she deserves it...that's what she gets for trying to bullshit everyone. I guess some are fooled by her...I'm not any more. I need to get her story back to her...that way, there will be nothing left of her in my room. Nothing. Then...of all things Lenny pulled her usual bullshit. I cannot believe she made a scene in the hospital...in front of all those people. I swear if I would have been there, I would have decked her. She thinks she knows what is so great for Alyson, yet she cannot even seem to take control of her own life. I mean, she's the one with the crackhead boyfriend who can't even take care of her cat, let alone her own kid. I mean, what kind of dumbass brings a daquiri into a hospital? You just don't do that. It's not right. What really pisses me off is what she told Alyson about me. How we should break up because being together for a year with a GIRL isn't right...bullshit. Both of us are the happiest we have ever been despite all the rough times we've faced...and no one needs to dictate to us whether or not we should "experiment" with guys or see other people. Been there, done that...don't want to do it again. And that is all I have to say on the matter. ~Somehow you've got everybody fooled~ -Evanescence "Everybody's Fool"

      Where to begin? I don't even know...I can't believe myself sometimes. I didn't realize that I was killing Alyson, didn't realize how miserable I was making her. All this time, I thought that she was the one making my life hell, when it was quite the opposite. I hate myself so much right now...I don't Alyson even realizes how much I hate my self. It...amazes me how dense I can be sometimes. No...it's not density...it's stupidity and blindness. I hate seeing and admitting that I'm the one that could possible hurt the one I love because I am so used to being the one to pick her back up when OTHER people break her down. I don't want to be the one breaking her down...my mind just can't fathom it. I can't believe I slipped back...back into being the person I despised the most. I hate seeing Alyson depressed, and I was making her so depressed. Though, I have to say, today could not have been better. Even though we ran all over the place, it was...nice. And tonight, I actually managed to break away for a little while without panicking, which is a very big deal to me. Part of the reason I think that&nbsp;I got back to being possessive is because our one year is at the end of this month. The idea of being in a relationship that long is just scary, and I guess I was terrified of losing it.And by being terrified, I pushed so hard and almost lost it. Great logic, huh? Well, that's all for now on the subject. It's depressing me talking about it. ~I don't want to be me~ -Amanda Clemens "Don't Want to be Me"

Especially the lines "It wasn't me...I'm not involved...I'm innocent...It's not my fault" reminds me so much of Sarah. She just...why do I even bother? Why did I even bother that day at the movies? I should have known better...she isn't worth it. I keep trying to hold onto something that isn't there...something that will never be there again. It's so fucking...sad. And then just a minute or two ago...Alyson said something that rather upset me. She told me, "You go read my blog and I'll never forgive you." She...actually seemed to think that I would do that. I know better than to do that, and besides, I wouldn't want her reading mine, so why in the hell would I want to go behind her back and do such a thing? She should know she can trust me more than that...but obviously not. No faith in me...I often wonder if anyone does have any faith left in me anymore. Kacie sounded so mad at me, Alyson had to warn me about something I didn't plan on doing in the first place...WHAT THE HELL? I don't know what to think anymore...I never know what to think anymore. I love Alyson, but sometimes I wonder if she still loves me...if I'm not boring her...or making it too hard to be with me. I don't mean to...it just sort of happens, but she does make it hard too. Sometimes I do want to just tell her to fuck off, and to break up with her. It would kill me, but sometimes it's just too much. Sometimes...I just wish I could disappear and go away...then I wouldn't have to deal with this. Not die, but...just go away. Then...maybe things would be different. ~My pain, my pride, these scars are mine  I will tell you a story That's never been told I will tell you a secret Five lifetimes old My life has been a prison A labyrinth built beneath the mountain of tragedy I'm a stain on the cloth I'm just an after-thought~ -Otep "Nein"

      Wow...tonight I think I had a bit of an epiphany. I know some of what I need to do now. I haven't been the best to Alyson...I got nervous when she started talking to Mary again, because...I know what used to happen and I would hate that to happen more than anything on the planet. Alyson snapped at her the other night, and I was quite surprised about what came out of her mouth...er...fingers. Made me realize some things...especially about Sarah. After talking with William and Ashley, I really realized that I don't want to have anything else to do with her. No talk, no emails, no notes...no anything. I don't want to be in her coven anymore, nor do I want to try to be her friend. After the movies, that showed me that she doesn't really want to be my friend all the time...only when she's bored or no one else will listen to her. Then she wonders why she can't keep any friends for too long. I mean, what kind of person treats people like she does? And why in the world do I keep wanting to be friends with her? It's like...I want her to do this. I am such an idiot sometimes. Anywho...I've really got to learn to stop trying to watch Alyson all of the time on the computer while she's online...I just...don't know why I do it. It's really dumb of me. *shakes head* I swear...I don't know why she puts up with me sometimes. I am so tired...I think I'm off to bed now. I just felt cheated out of not getting to finish my entry earlier since the compy misbehaved. ~I'm alone in the city, my hands are stoned with pity, and I can get by or high with fifty, and I don't feel pretty today. -Otep "House of Secrets"

      For anyone who hasn't gotten it, the new Otep CD called "House of Secrets" is fucking awesome. There are so many great lyrics from&nbsp; it...the first track has this lyric that reminds me so much of my house: "If you are under my roof, you will respect me..." and there are crashing sounds in the background. It just reminds me of my dad so much... &nbsp;~I hate my life~ -Otep

      ACK! School is going to be starting in a week! NOT GOOD! Where the hell did the summer go? I don't know...I mean, it just seems like we got out of school. Why can't the school year go that fast?&nbsp;It took forever to get through my junior year. I mean, I am looking forward to being a senior and all with all the respect and stuff that I've waited twelve years to get...and plus I get first pick on parking spots! I might have a nice, decent AUTOMATIC car by then. I always wanted to drive to school my senior year, and now I'm going to have the chance to do so. I can't wait. I am looking forward to it, I guess...the only problem is that Alyson isn't going to be there. I don't know what I'm going to do...I'm going to miss seeing her in the hall between classes. Neither one of us is going to be able to survive not seeing one another all day...but I'm glad that we're living together...otherwise we would never see each other. I couldn't handle that. I know sometimes we fight, but times like this are when it's all worthwhile. We've been spending all day together...working on OUR site that we designed together and so much more...I love it. By the way, if anyone wants to check it out, the url is  urlLink www.geocities.com/desires_unchained . Very worth it to go and see what we've done. Not much is up, but you can still check it out. Anway, things have been going good...my dad finally went back to work, so he's not hanging around the house anymore and annoying us. Also, that means more money coming in so we'll be able to buy groceries and school supplies. I don't know if I'm going to like having him home every night, but he is going to have more time to do his music, which will mean that he'll be out of the house and away from us. I know it sounds so horrible to say that about my dad, but...it's the truth. ~Truth is stranger than fiction~ -Don't know

      What happens when you hate yourself And wish that would die? All because of what I did and the look within your eye I cannot make you happy You've forgotten how to smile I often wonder why you're here What makes it all worthwhile You hate me  For what I say...  And I deserve it.  Why can't I stop fucking up with Alyson? Every time I tease or say something...it always makes her mad and she ignores me...like she's doing now. I hate myself...hate myself for hurting her. Why can't I just say the right thing, the things that don't agitate and annoy her? Almost&nbsp;a year, and I haven't learned. How sad is that?

      I got my license finally! God, it felt so good receiving it finally. I like driving a lot...Alyson swears I'm going to get tired of it, but I think it's relaxing. Now, I just have to learn how to drive the Saturn, and then it shall be mine. Having my license marks (at least for me) that I have freedom and can start to do things on my own. Once I have the car in my possession, I'm going to get a job and make money, as well as start going places, regardless of what my parents say. I'm tired of being caged, tired of being treated like the parent instead of the kid. I want to be reckless, irresponsible, and not give a fuck for once. I want to lean over and kiss Alyson in front of them, then walk out and say, "There you go" but that is going a bit far lol. I don't know...I'm just so tired of having no freedom whatsoever. Or the money to do anything. Thanks to my father, I can't get new school clothes like I had hoped this weekend because he doesn't want to get off his lazy ass and get a job. Now, my mom has more to worry about and he just bitches and complains that there is no money or anything. I would help out if I could, but I have to sit at home. Hopefully, I'll be able to get that job at Vianne's and I'll be able to have some money. *sighs* Who knows? ~"I've been to hell, young man...you've only read about it" -Geoffery Rush as Marquee de Sade in "Quills"
