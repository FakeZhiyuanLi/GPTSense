       Last night I actually got a hold of Russ. Well I normaly do....but still it felt good to talk for 2 min. out of the day. ( i know its pathetic) Anyways he had to leave cuz he was going over to his friends house but he told me would call me when he got there. Well that was a lie. So I decided to call. So i did and when i did someone picked up the phone and was like,"what the fuck do you want?" I was kinda annoyed but i said," is russ there?" The person goes yea....but he uh....stepped out and I don't know where he went.  What the hell? See that makes me think that he cheating one me. After that i was kinda upset like I always am.    Later that night i called my greatest guy friend. I knew he would tell me how it is. Which he did and I didn't really like to hear what he had to say. But i guess it was for the best. I explained the situation to him. He has also herd the story from the beging with me and Russ so he knew how Russ was. Plus he sorta knew Russ and how he was. He told me that he is justusing me right now, and he wont break up with me. So basically he was saying that RUss doesn't like me anymore...he is just being a jerk and not telling me that he doesn't want a relationship anymore. I really hated to hear that. But after I got off the phone with him ....I started to realize that what he was saying did make a lot of sense. I mean he never wants to talk to me or he doesn't make the effort to see me. Did i do something that is makeing him not like me? I would really appreciate it if he would just break it off with me if he doesn't want to be with me anymore. Also too...i feel like he doesn't want to see me because of someone else. I really don't know right now.

        Well last night was little bit better then usual, but it all ended up in the same way. I went to go visist my dad. Since my parents are divorced its required that I see him till i am 18. Then after that I can decide on my own. Either way I hate seeing him. He thinks that seeing him for 1-2 hours a week is quality time. I particulary don't like him do to the fact that he is....controlling and way to pushy. Schools over so why talk about any more then you have too. Parents!     After I got back from my dads I called my friend Becky and talked to her about Russ. I called him when I had the chance to sneak away and talk. He ended telling me that he showed up at my house to see if i wanted to hangout. But of course with my luck I wasn't there. The part that doesn't make sense to me is that he knows that I work every day until about 4 or 5. I told him why didn't you just call my cell. He said the same stupid line he always says....."i 4got your #" How many times do i have to tell him it...when he writes it down, i give to his friends, and he called me on it b4? Anyways......i got a hold of him when i got home....but of course he was eating. I swear he just says he is eating because he doesn't want to talk. (what can i do?) Yea so we talked for a little bit...then we both had to go but he told me that he would call after his drug n' alchol classes which ended at 9 i'm guessing, then he said he would call me at 9:30. Well 9:30 finally rolled around then 10 then 11 then. I didn't expect him to call, I guess i thought that since he sounded for real he was actually gonna go through with his words. But the day that would happen is the day a pig would fly. (NEVER) I really like him A LOT. Its just that it seems like he never wants to talk or hangout. For me ...i have to be able to have a long in depth conversation to have a "real relationship". I guess he just doesn't want that or me if that.

       Well today is diffrent day, but its the same ol' shit. Last night was really shity though. My boyfriend and I were supposed to hangout (again). Well suprise suprise (sarcasticly)we didn't. He told me he would call after he was done "eating" which was around 6 o'clock. Then 8 rolled around then eventually 9. Thats when it was offical that we weren't going to hangout that night. Thats the 3rd time that has happend to me. I guess there is something wrong with me that he isn't telling me? I have no idea. Whenever I call him he is either eating or too tired or he is leaving wherever he is at. But mostly he is eating . How much can one human possibly eat. I mean I eat a lot but he eats like a seumo wresteler!  Later that night I ended up talking to my friend Becky who has been their every step of the way through this whole thing. All she pretty much has to say through the whole thing is,"Break UP with him!" I really wasn't expecting anything else. Right now if i get hurt after all this ....its my own stupidity really. I mean if i were smart i should've backed out a long time back. But i really don't know what is holding me back. I guess its like what i said before, " i need a guy in my life." God that sounds so pathetic when I put it like that. Well no matter how i put it, it is going to sound pathetic. haha I guess that is all really ....I will wright more later.

          I am working right now. I have job working with little kids and everyday they get to go on the computer for 45 min. and do whatever they want. I decide to go online. Anyways....to me I have no real relationship. It all seems unreal. We barely ever talk. He always tells me that he will call and he wants to hangout but we never do.       The thing that everyone should know about my boyfriend is that he is a major bad ass. He has been in a lot of trouble before. He told me that he wants a girl who is pretty much down to earth and isn't as messed up as all his other girlfriends. Almost as if he wants to change and have a real girlfriend and not the kind were you just get a piece of ass from. Atleast thats what I got out of it when we talked. Its like he is a bad guy that wants to turn good but there is too much of a bad guy that he can never be good. Its not that I don't believe that he can't be good ......cuz I really think he can , its just that right now he isn't doing a really good job in showing me that he wants to have a real girlfriend. Then its like he would tell himself that he is a good boyfriend and he would tell his friends like,"Yea thats my girlfriend right there....my real girlfriend." Its like he uses me to be the good guy who he wants to be. But when he wants to mess around and not have a real relationship he will cheat and go screw some other girl and cheat on me but then come back to me and have the real relationship again. Even though he denies cheating on me ....I still have a really strong gut feeling that he is. I mean I can't prove that he is cheating on me. I only hear stories, and you can't always rely on other people for your information. Plus I am getting half the info from his ex girlfriend who i think still wants to be with him. So I am sorta stuck on who to believe. The story is just so long ..and sort of all sounds the same but it just feels good talk about or let out one of the two.

          My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a month and about 2 weeks. I really like him a lot. He is sweet when we are together but he just seems like he really isn't interested outside of being with him. The other day he was supposed to come over and we were supposed to hangout but he decided to go down to the bay with his ex girlfriend and not even bother to call and tell me that he is going. So he pretty much stood me up. Then he always tells me he is going to call and ends up never calling. My friends and people who I barely even talk to tell me that he is cheating on me and all he tells me is a bunch of lies. I really don't want to believe any of it because I crazy about him. I don't even understand what makes me think he is so wonderful. I know that if I would have friend who had a guy like this I would tell her to dump him A.S.A.P! I am also to the type of girl who needs to have a guy in her life. I know it sounds so pathetic but it is the truth, and I don't have a problem admitting the truth. I am just one of those types of girls. I am usually not the one to put up with shit, but this is just diffrent to me this time around. Whenever I talk to him I want to jump through the phone and just tell him how much i am crazy about him. But then again I don't want him knowing how much I like him because then he may think he can get away with whatever he wants cuz i am too cought up with him. But then again if I tell him how much I really like him then maybe things would change between us? Who knows all I know is that I want things to be right between us. NO LIES and NO CHEATING!
