         I  guess the 'blogolution' has been going on for some time now, so I figured it was time to jump aboard the train. Actually, most of my interest was piqued after a recent  urlLink article  (though the tale has been widely publicized before but unbeknownst to me) in the Washington Post Magazine, where a überlong story chronicled the debaucheries of what appears to be a little girl with a misguided, though terribly representative, persona running rampant in today’s America.    The title suggests the all the dirt regarding “Washington’s latest sex scandal and what it says about Capitol Hill, the dangers of the Web, and the post-feminist woman.” Sure the article was meant to be a tirade against just such revealing blogumentaries, but I figured that my life is boring enough, might as well advertise it to the world! (ha, the  world , riiight.  I'm lucky to have ONE person read it)  Though I must be contained by certain restrictions which little “JC” wasn’t hampered by, namely the freedom to air my dirty laundry to whomever I choose to share the location of this little blobsicle.  I can’t just go on talking about those near and dear to me, cause well, they can’t know what I’m really thinking. Not that there is anything bad going on necessarily, but just that I’m the Mr. International Man of Mystery and it is going to stay that way. And besides, I’m no sexy package she is, I’m not hired for jobs for the sake of possible sexcapades despite a obviously sharp mind and honed intellect…well damn, I don’t even have a job. So THERE, JC, you win. Fine. Leave. Off with you! Hmm, wanna go out?  I suppose my motivation to blog will be similar to that of any 13-year-old girl. You know the type, writing in a diary with one of those “keep your secrets safe” locks that pop open just by looking at them- ooh, a place to keep my dirty little secrets. No, my motivations for this investment of time in a blog will simply be for something to do, a way to free my mind, share my gifts with the world, whichever bullshit answer helps you sleep at night. It’s mostly just to have the stuff down on paper, cause what I’ve realized over the years is that there is nothing worse than forgetting what you’ve done of the lessons you’ve learned. Here, I hope to heed my own Archimedian wisdom (and no I don’t mean the famous philosopher, I mean that fucking owl in The Sword in the Stone).  No, so what is really the point of these? I’ve read that they are ways of being discovered as some amazing, pop-culture writer that knows all the newest Bush jokes and has the crazy access to glue pennies on the stage at the RNC so they can watch Cheney split his pants bending down to achieve his prize. Are they to advertise products you use? Hobbies y��dSnjoy? Proclaim how many people you’ve fucked or fucked over in a given week? Well, we’ll just see which manifestation mine assumes. But one thing is for sure, screw a political soapbox, that thing just ain’t my bag…Sorry Ms. Alonso.   O n to the  Live  (pronounced  liv-eh  like in Finland) I want to make a statement about my buddy Eitan, the Romanian/Hungarian wonderchild who has attempted the unthinkable, for the  second  time. No, not winning the male stripping contest at club Wet (DL), but rather the American Idol  urlLink auditions , going on this week at the new Washington Convention Center. The guy takes off two days of work to wait outside in line for like 20 some hours (yes, he spent the night there) and yes, for the  second  time (his first was in NYC while still in college). Now though it was a long shot, a fact obvious to him, my hat comes off to him for chasing that dream and roughing it in that WCC. Haven’t heard the story yet how it went, but no doubt I’m buying that man a drink for going for the juice.  Today I got some iffy news. I’ve been gunning for a job at this old internship place for a while now,  urlLink Arnold Worldwide , and I really had my hopes up that today I’d receive word that a new entry level position would be opened up. But, alas, my old HR buddy informed me that no decision was made either way concerning the matter, which I am to assume is a closed door. Do I wait a little longer? Do I start going for other jobs again…whoever said the job search would be hard needs to get slapped for being right!  The tuomasquerade, look out everyone, I’m clever. I can combine two words and make it one. Kneel before me! Ha, what was that game back in the day on like MTV or something? Well, masquerade means ‘to pretend to be somebody or something else; a pretense or disguise.’ So, I’m pretending, I’m being someone else…being all open, revealing, honest, what have you.  Eff that noise.    BOOM  . That is all.
