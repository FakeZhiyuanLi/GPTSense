         oh my god! Okay, I still don't know how to add pictures to my blog! But never mind......this is quite good already!Hmm...i wonder what to say?  I went to nepets today and got cheated by the kitchen Quests!!! Ya know??? Well, i am now trying very hard to earn money,  by the way, i must not let my father go see what website i went into todae(later he read my blog...??) So, i kept wondering why nobody posted any comments on my blog?       I just don't understand the math chapter 9!  ~~the question seem so difficult to understand!

       i  know what's going on with me nowadays, i just keep getting lazier. it would be a long way to go before i get to finish my home assignment. But wats the point of getting worried when i don't have the mood to start working? my mother had been a good motivator to get me to work, but it was no use.( Mei yong de, Mei yong de) no use one. so wat am i going to do? by the way, Diana's table was kicked today. I dunno who did it but i have a feeling that tells me its zhenling. She has been asking who is that"sucker"to write nasty things about her in her blog today. This whole thing is so irritating. By the way, the math relief teacher is a **. Starts lesson the moment she steps into the classroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;And keeps giving us work to do. I should be real busy, but i dun seem to. Just keep watching tv and going online.Well, I don't think this&nbsp;kind of life suits me but it seems to me that i am tired and listless all day and time is passing o quickly!&nbsp;

        oh shit!!!!!!    2morrow will be the English common test and I had not prepare for it   bud who'd tell me how to revise for ENGLISH   you cannot expect me to memories the dictionary or do anything else like that   I was just thinking what if my English fail this time round???   oh, god help me   I am now more and more confused   bud, of course, I have other very troubling problems too. Oh, bloody hell shit man. How am I gone to overcome this?   well, I dunno wat to do and rite now I need someone to guide me, but the problem is who?????   I felt that I am getting isolated from this world these few day, I don't feel like talking to anybody or go out with anybody. I just want to be alone. But I think this would only make the situation more worse than ever before(okay I am just exxagerating...).    Hmmm..... I was wondering if I could chat with a complete stranger whom none of my friends know... well like people in other countries except Singapore.    life is getting more and more boring.   what am I going to do now to salvage the journey ahead of me....   I'm going to have a serious headache if this kind of nonsense continues inside me, myself.. I can't concentrate in whatever things I do and I know that this kind of lifestyle wouldn't make me through...   I have a strong feeling inside me that motivates me to change for a better me, however, I am already strengthless. I have no will power to carry me through, and I am now too weak to make any decisions of my own.   My determination has been shattered ever since I begun to realise the I had been such a nuisance and was always making a fool of myself. I tried to cheer people up but in the end I get only glances of disapproval. What am I to do when the whole world had made me a sinner?--Time shall reveal the answer... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...... ... ...

      wow, i  am celebrating national day todae and that te chinese orchestra have performed, it is so tiresome. bt, of course, it was fun. we had a great time and we sang on stage. okay, my mother have helped me plait my hair and it was sooooooo cute!!!!!!!! well, how i wish i could stay longer in school but they were all going to northpoint. so i think i better not joi them in case i go home very late. i visited myprimary school and had saw my form teacher miss tan and my chinese teacher mr ang. todae so quite a memorable day. i dun know wy, but i think i shall never plait my hair again as my classmates are always teasing me.. haha well oday is fun. after the performance, our school oragnised a handball match. well okay, we won for te first round but sadly, we lost, but i dun think it was our fault. the stupid 2n2 is just being uncivilsed and rough. perhaps we are just more polite. however, while thw game is in progress, shaun could not stand it anymore and went in to play rough with them. Qingyuan was also requested by us to goon sourt but he refused, but it was natural for him to do this. i cannot describe why but i think it was just pai sei.... ... By the way, i was quite upset to not seeing gabriel and chenxiao back... well you know, they are my friends and i have not seen them for a very long ttime, almost a year i think!!!!.okay Hmm, a good news is i have saved the song sakura by zang shan wei inside the cmputer, this song is just so nice and i love it. Haha, my memory is improving as i had remember to bring the CD to return to yunli, Wow! Amazing! Wahaha.

      i somehow feel that i am being unwelcomed in school and that no one notices me even if i am not around. i felt that i am transparent. well, this is quite a sad thing actually. I kept asking myself one question nowadays"am i being myself and am i always wearing a mask whenever i am not at home?" perhaps gos knows the answer but does he really? i am confused. it seems to me that i have been acting the whole time to compromise and to make people accept me, however, it wasn't me. maybe the above sentence sounds confusing! perhaps things would change for the better f only i could e myself, be who i am, and be the most natural me.??? Oh, this is really confusing. What am i suppose to do? The only answer that i had now is to stop acting and perhaps people would just accept me for who i am?? Will it help?I don't know. i just felt that i am being neglected in class and they just don't bother about my exsistance. I am such a failure. perhaps i have been blur for a few times or so on but most of the time i took notice of whats going on but i just want to ignore t.
