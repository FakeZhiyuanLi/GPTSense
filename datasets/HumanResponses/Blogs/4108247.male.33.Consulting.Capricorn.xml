      I had a few weird dreams last night. Not sure what they mean so writing it down may help. I had a dream I was reading a paper a discovered one of my close friends from Jr High mother was killed while showing a real-estate property, I guess she buys property and fixes them up into Barbershops (I did see a clip from the movie last night) . I contact my friend and say my condolences and we catch up.  The paper did a whole story on his family because his brother happens to be an all-prep football star – I think he was a QB. I started playing catch with him and but he was terrible; he could not throw a tight spiral. I was like and he’s a star? Plus he has white and my friends family was black, He’s other brother was white also and happens to be a colleague of mine at work? But in the dream I didn’t seem surprised.  Next thing I know I’m around a whole bunch of young people ready to party – One girl is very beautiful and she really likes me. Somehow I get assigned to get the party started and needed to hook up the music – for some reason I can only hook up on speaker so the music is not very loud – people are getting frustrated and I feeling embarrassed – especially since the young lady is ready to dance. I think we finally decide to hit a club but I don’t have anything to wear?  **I wake up**

      Thanks Rosie/Margarita Today K got home from visiting her family. It was good to have time alone without the kids and her - I didn't do much over the weekend except hang out at this ghetto-ass cookout. It was cool thought because they did have madd food, drink and weed. Today I just drove around looking for some Jamaican food. Anyways when K arrives back home we start fighting because I spent $100 on some sneakers and did not get her anything - She mentioned that she needed some running shoes- I guess that's where my mind is because she never crossed my mind when I bought the shoes. I'm taking them back tomorrow. Of course I'm trying to watch TV and the bitch is in my ear trying to argue. I swear I wanted to scream so hard to SHUT THE FUCK UP!! but I held my tongue and gave her the silent treatment. I just hate being around most of the time - I think we both get sick of each other. I’m not happy but I not sure if it’s this marriage or it’s me? I know I’m when I’m by myself I’m the most at ease. If it wasn’t daughters I would be so gone!! I don’t want my marriage to be a failure; I don’t want to be separated from my daughters, I don’t want to be alone, I would hate to start over with someone else then have that relationship fail (like my dad). I wish I could just leave and move to Rio –my favorite place in the world. I’m getting tired.

       I figured I need some place to gather my thoughts. I'm one confused black man and I never really have talked about my issues. This is the beginning of many entries concerning myself and daily issues. Today I almost cried watching Bend it like Beckham! What the fuck did that come from? I have to be depressed about my life but my life is not that bad. I have a wife and two beautiful daughters that love me to death, What else is missing?       My best friend ask the other day do I really love my wife? I think I love K but something is missing. I'm not sure but maybe the passion or the romance. I think it the attraction or the newness of love. Maybe it's this way with all married couples - it has been 6 years and counting. I'm not sure if it's me or is it her. I always wonder if I would be experiencing this with someone else. I thought that having Kennedy would bring the joy back into our relationship, it has but not on a romantic level. I do enjoy traveling again, it's nice to get away and be social, visiting new cities. It would be better if I had money and not having to scrape by on every trip. I hoping that Kara and myself can maybe look more attractive for each other - I think that's a big part in our relationship. I really just think it's just the excitement or just the true romance that I may need. Not sure if any women could provide that. I really liked the Becky at my client site- she just had something that made her so appealing. She wasn't drop dead gorgeous but she was sexy and so funny. I can really dig someone like that. Do I really want to find someone, risk my marriage and being away from my children? I'm I happy?
