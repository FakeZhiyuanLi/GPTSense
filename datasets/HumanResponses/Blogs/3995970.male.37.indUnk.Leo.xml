      Whether or not you are a Democrat (God help you), or a Republican (God help them), you have to admit one thing about the Democratic convention so far: It has been chalk full of&nbsp;speakers&nbsp;who&nbsp;have presented in&nbsp;a cheesy, old fashioned, canned, polished and televangelistic manner. Great show-but I do not "see" anyone there.   My walls go up whenever a speaker at church presents in an inauthentic,&nbsp;polished, ryhthmic,&nbsp;presentation and televangelistic type&nbsp;manner-it makes me feel like I am being "presented to" or "talked at", not "spoken to".&nbsp; Most politicians are the same way, Democrat or Republican.   However, you have to hand it to Bush, he is not like these guys, or he is really good at faking authenticity. Even Newt Gingrich, who I do not really like,&nbsp; had a good review of what he had seen so far, and I believed that he believed what he was saying.

      Wow! My Rachel is quite the writer, isn't she? If you have not been to her blog you really must visit it at  urlLink www.rachelstratford.blogspot.com . Of course, I have always known how awesome of a writer she is (I have hundreds of emails from her that I have saved since we met) but I am glad more people are getting to know this side of her.  I read Roger Sellers reports on some emerging churches from&nbsp;around the country  urlLink http://www.porticochurch.org/travel.htm &nbsp;thanks to the link from Doug Pagitt's blog,  urlLink http://pagitt.typepad.com/ , and I have to tell you-he is&nbsp;right on in his reviews. My family and I have attended regularly two of the churches he reviewed, Pathways church in Denver and Solomon's Porch in Minneapolis, and we have attended The Next Level church in Denver. I found myself nodding while reading his reviews. In my opinion, he perfectly captured the essence of each of these three churches. By the way their websites are:  urlLink www.pathwayschurch.org  &  urlLink www.Solomonsporch.com .  I was one of three leaders who took about 23 high school age kids from Greenwood Community Church in the south suburbs of Denver to Juarez, Mexico a few weeks ago. We went there to finish building a school cafeteria and other various projects. If you have never been on a mission trip, I strongly recommend it. Many of the kids went on this trip to “help others” and “do some good”-what they realized by the end of the trip is that they got out of it just about as much as they put into to it-if not more.  There were many highlights of the trip for me, but the one that stands out is hearing so many of the kids give praise to my 16 year old son Tyler. They referred to him as someone they looked up to as a spiritual leader. I could not help but begin to cry as these praises were all but sung to him during our final meeting. What a proud moment that was for me. I cannot think of a greater compliment for a young man.  Like me, Tyler has only become a Christian recently (for him, a few months ago, for me, 3 and a half years), and it seems that because of this decision being late in life we have both been spared a lot of the baggage that results from growing up in Christian home. Don’t get me wrong, we have our baggage, but we do not struggle against the “spiritual abuse” wounds of our past due to a fundamentalist and/or legalistic environment that seems oblivious to the fact that Grace, love and forgiveness are the foundations of our faith.   While on the one hand I realize that I regrettably wasted a lot of my life not following Christ, the way our parent’s generation tried to instill Christian values in my friends often times did more harm than good. I am often asked by people I meet in the evangelical world if my church (Solomon’s Porch or Pathways) is a “seekers church”. I tell them that “yes” it is seeker friendly, but most of the people tend to be people who grew up as believers and fit into one of two categories: 1) they walked away from the church because they were disgruntled and now they are coming back, or 2) They were looking for something more from Christianity than what they had experienced in there past. Of course, seekers do often times feel more comfortable at Pathways or The Porch (or many other “emerging churches), but especially in the case of The Porch, they are not in the majority. I have witnessed the struggles due to this spiritual baggage time and time again in my friends and loved ones who grew up as Christians, and I witnessed it every night in my son’s peers during our group discussions in Mexico. One boy stated (paraphrasing) “I am so frustrated! Who am I to believe? My mom says I need to ‘Just read the bible more’ to get closer to God, my teacher says I need to ‘Just pray everyday’ to feel closer to God. Now you’re telling me I am supposed to experience a relationship with Christ that is much more than all that?” The concept of “experiencing an authentic relationship with Christ and your community” was nearly lost on many of these kids because of what they had been hammered with for so many years by well-intentioned but misguided parents. By the end of the trip, many of them seemed closer to getting it, but I fear that as soon as they got back home they were going to lose some ground here.  The kids are used to going on these trips, having an “On the Mountain Top” experience and then getting back to “reality” when they got home. We tried to instill in them the fact that this experience they were having did not have to end. That they did not have to settle for the superficiality and seemingly meaningless relationships in the experience of their day to day lives. That their walk with Christ and in the body could be authentic and real every day of there lives if they so chose. Not that life had to be spiritually heavy every moment of every day, but that the people they chose to spend time with could be people they knew on a deeper and more authentic level. That this relationship with Christ would be a journey that would have its good and bad days and that it would be through God’s grace they would grow closer to him-not through achievements.  This seems so much easier for me and my son to grasp than those who grew up as Christians. It also seems so unfair to me that the friends I have struggle with this after having dedicated their lives to Christ at such a younger age than I did. Is it merely a coincidence that the pastors of Pathways and Solomon’s Porch did not come to Christ until later in life? The pastor of Pathways, Ron Johnson, did not come to Christ until college, and Doug Pagitt, the pastor at The Porch did not come to Christ until he was 16 if I remember right.  After a few months of attending The Porch I had this conversation Doug Pagitt that I really enjoyed our church and that I simply “got it”. He said-“isn’t that just great feeling?” I felt that way even more so after reading the book the church wrote “Reimagining Spiritual Formation: A Week in Life of an Experimental Church” (you can buy this at Amazon.com).   Rachel and I moved south of Denver way out in the suburbs. We want to find a church where we can more easily be a part of the community on a regular basis, without having to drive downtown. Like The Porch, Pathways is near downtown, so we have been visiting churches in the burbs in hopes of finding the community we are in need of. After church on Sunday, as we were leaving a “not bad at all” suburban church she asked me what I thought about it. Unexpectedly I began to cry as I thought of the community experience I longed for and am so far unable to find here in “Highlands Ranch”.  &nbsp;

      So my wife is a little resentful about my new blog site (see  urlLink www.rachelstratford.blogspot.com ). Well, I guess she will eventually get over it. She is such an amazing writer&nbsp;I am sure my blogspot pales in comparison to hers anyway.  I have way too much on my plate, and I do not seeing it change anytime soon. My responsibilities are overwhelming when I think about them, so I try not to. Especially when I have so much to be thankful for. If I can just get a good workout in at least every other day I think I will be fine.  Well, speaking of responsibilities, I am out of time to write on my blog. I will write more tomorrow-if time and Rachel will allow it.

      I am&nbsp;just plain&nbsp;tired of being labeled a "white guy" my entire life. I am actually 1/16 Blackfoot Native American and 1/16 Cherokee Native American. My great grandma was 100% Cherokee and my great grandpa was 100% Blackfoot-this makes me 1/8 native American. Now I am not looking for any kind of $$$ for my "race", but&nbsp; I am just not going to stand for being anyone's "token white friend" or "token yuppie", even if I am also quite a bit German.&nbsp;("German?-Germaine...Jackson...Tito...Jackson Five! What are you talking about? I don't know, I don't know, really.")  &nbsp;  I actually have the official&nbsp;title of "Rap Manager" with the company Phat Nasty Productions. Of course, that's only because "All World Chillin' D'" approached me a few years ago and asked: "Dan, me and my boys were wondering if you could be available to represent us if we need someone to front as our manager, because you are our only truly white friend who doesn't speak Ebonics." I accepted, and actually went to one of there gigs in downtown Minneapolis where I was introduced as their manager. What if the racial roles were reversed in this situation? Sure, I rolled with it-but don't think it doesn't hurt.  &nbsp;  When the New York Times sent a reporter to follow Solomon's Porch (my church/community in Minneapolis) for a "Hip New Churches Sway to a Different Drummer" article the only mention of me was in the statement: "most (at the Tuesday men's breakfast) were musicians or artists; only one wore a tie." Guess who the guy was who WASN'T a musician, but "just a poser" according to Doug Pagit.&nbsp;What&nbsp;was not in the article&nbsp;was how I was referred to as the “token yuppie" and how Dustin said "everyone should have one". And this is supposedly a "Hip New Church". The reverse prejudice runs deep, really deep.  &nbsp;  Keep in mind that in Rockhurst University's production of Eric Overmeyer's play "On The Verge" I played 7 characters as the only male role in the play. The characters I played included an African warrior, an Italian club owner "Frank Sinatra" type, a yeti, a Cuban diplomat&nbsp;and an Asian woman.  &nbsp;  Don't get me wrong, when it comes to getting a well paying job I disguise myself as the perfect yuppie during the interview, but I check that box that says I am "Native American/Alaskan Native" on the paperwork. Why? Because&nbsp;I am proud of my heritage, and THE MAN stole my country. Of course, another irony is that my father's side of the family "owns" much of Montana in the form of oil wells and ranches. I would protest, but there is still some small chance I could get a trust fund out of the deal. Like .0000000000000001%, if that.&nbsp;Of course, what small inheritance I have received so far was reduced by 50% because my father adopted me, which meant I was not "blood". Seriously.  &nbsp;  So if you choose to continue to visit my blog (I promise that&nbsp;much of the time I am the positive, “Anthony Robbins type” many people have me pegged for), please&nbsp;try to throw your preconceived notions about me out the window and maybe you will see me for who I truly am(superficially speaking, of course):&nbsp;a biracial&nbsp;yuppie thespian rap manager father husband mountain biker soccer player funky dude who listens to "Prince music" way too much but still loves Jesus-not just another poser white guy.&nbsp; Of course, Jesus was not a white guy either, but try telling that to some people.

      Earlier this year a friend of mine called me on his birthday. He said, "You know, Dan, I was sitting here feeling a little down because no one was calling me and wishing me a happy birthday, and then I realized, no one probably knows it's my birthday, so why don't I call a few people?"  I thought it was a great idea, because guys do not remember other guys' birthdays. Which is just fine. I have never been bothered by a friend forgetting to to wish me a happy birthday. Why not just call your friends and tell them?  In my old office ion Maple Grove we had a policy where when it was your birthday you brought in a treat for the people you worked with. I loved this concept because no one was under any pressure to remember your birthday or give you a gift, and on my birthday when I brought in all sorts of bagels and cream cheese everyone was surprised and happy to see me. What a great birthday present, eh?  So please comment or call me on my cell (720-985-7945) and wish me a happy birthday. It will make both of us smile.  Maturity?  After I read my last immature and offensive blog (although much of it was just me pouring out some of my frustrations with my life right now). I read "Exile's" comment. No offense, Exile, but "hearing" you say "I like virgins too" just creeped me out (even though all you said was "Me to Dan”). It made me feel dirty. I just do not think it is really possible to make that statement without it sounding perverted. My apologies if I offended anyone with that. I even thought about deleting that part of my blog. If you think I should, please comment. I am not saying I am going to, but I would like your feedback. At least with blogs you can edit stuff after the fact-unlike after you send someone an email.  Today I am going to work (but not too hard and not for too long-kind of a "Doug Pagitt" day :)) and relax, maybe go out to dinner and see a movie.  Hope ya'll have a great week-end!  ...and in case I missed any of your birthdays-"Happy Birthday!"

      I like this whole reductionist thinking thing Doug has out on his blog. "Camping Mocks The Homeless" is funny, and I understand the point of the whole thing. The title of my blog and the title of this post are in line with that. Taken for face value the statement "I am not a white guy-and neither was Jesus" could be considered racist or at least racially insensitive. Hopefully if you read my first post you would see otherwise. Of course "I like virgins" may actually offend some people as well.  Last night at dinner my wife handed me some "virgin" coconut oil as she espoused the health benefits of eating this solid fatty substance a teaspoon at a time.  Of course, the "pathetic immature lacking discernment" side of me made the juvenile statement:  "Oh, I like virgins." (I still laugh like a 15 year old as I read this-because of who was there)  As many of you know, her mom is living with us, but it was just the three of us at the dinner table.  They both pretended they did not hear me, and we continued with the conversation about how "virgin coconut oil" cures almost everything.  Later that night, as my wife and I lay in bed talking, she questioned me on why I would say such a stupid thing-especially in front of her mom.  In my justification speach (eventually I admitted it was a stupid thing to say), I pointed out that I DO like virgins. My children are virgins, the Virgin Mary was a virgin, Jesus was a virgin. In fact, I am PRO-virgin! Until marriage, of course.  So why, really, would I say such a thing in front of her mom?  Having "Mrs. Canella" live with us (I am not allowed to call her "Terry") has been, on the surface, fairly easy.  She pays us rent, she cleans, cooks and we have the freedom to go see a movie after we put the kids to bed. I am very appreciative.  The problem is that I do not, nor should I, trust her with my heart (which is why I cannot bring myself to call her "Mom"). Based on past experience, I am quite sure she is biting her tongue as she (on the inside) judges nearly every single thing Rachel and I do as parents, spouses and as people. I am also certain that when we are not around she is telling everyone she can about how horrible of a husband and father I am and how I am irresponsible in every way imaginable. This underlying tone in nearly every moment of her presence wears us down, and adds tension to our lives. I should add that I DO trust her with my children.  How do I know this? Am I being paranoid?  No, because over the last three years I have lost count of the number of times people have come up to me or my wife and said something to the affect of "Your mom told me..." blah, blah blah. It is usually something about how hard our marriage is (how bad of a husband I am), how horrible of parents we are (me mostly) or something else that is derogatory (like Dan is financially irresponsible). Some of these people we barely know, some of them are close friends, some are even business acquaintances. The last time this happened was this past June.  So if all this gets back to us in a big town like Denver-imagine what does NOT get back to us?  Of course, she is a bible thumping evangelical Christian who is usually blind to her own sin, and just adds to my attitude towards people like her. We did NOT bring her to The Porch when she was in MPLS because we knew how she would judge, and how she would make us pay for it.  I deal with this by daily forgiveness. If I did not forgive, it would burn me up inside. However, forgiveness does not mean I trust. It would be naive of me to trust. (I do NOT trust her with my wife's heart either. When she hurts my wife I have a much more difficult time with forgiveness.)  So as I walk through my own home feeling like I am being judged on a daily basis, maybe you can understand why I would say something stupid (but technically true, of course) like "Oh, I like virgins."  I think that sub-consciously I figure if I am going to be giving her enough things to talk about for the rest of her life over the 3-5 months she lives with us, she may as well have some truly interesting things to talk about.  I know, I know. It was an immature thing to say, and I cannot blame Mrs. Canella for my immaturity. I take FULL responsibility and I am sorry.  I still like virgins.

      I don't know, he shows up at my birthday bash last year at Jazzmin's downtown, and now he takes a tour break to be back in MPLS the same week I go back.  WHO's stalking WHO!?!   urlLink http://www.prince.org/msg/7/105368/Prince_shows_up_to_play_guitar_in_MPLS   He'll probably come to Denver close to my birthday this year-oh wait-he has already scheduled it!  Seriously, I must confess that my car 6 disc changer has ALL MPLS music in it-usually 3-4 Prince CDs and 2-3 Porch related CDs. Unless I am in a Bryan Regan mood.  What can I say, I have great taste in music.  Speaking of great music, I had lunch with Jav' yesterday-he got to hear just part of my story about the 3 weeks I spent in Abu-Dahbi, UAE. I have so much fun hanging out talking to Jav'. Then I had the pleasure of seeing another MPLS great, Brad Henshaw, at Border's Books on Lyndale on my way to the airport.  If I would have stuck around and gone to Bunker's it would have been a Hat Trick! (see weblink)  Well, time for me to drive back home from Colorado Springs.  What's in your CD player today?

      So I am back in MPLS this week until Thursday evening.  First of all-thank you to the Barnhills for letting shack up with them for a few days. I enjoyed hanging out with kids, talking politics with Jim and Carla kicking us out Sunday night to go see a movie with Doug and company.  We saw the movie "The Village".  It was fun seeing my friends and “family” in MPLS. I know Rachel wishes she could have come too. It is weird, but I don’t really feel that far away from you guys between the blogging and the fact we never actually lived close to anyone at the Porch to begin with. It is good to be back in Denver with Tyler and Madison but we are having a hard time letting go of you all. I feel like we never really got to be as good of friends with many of you as we could have been, because just as our relationships began to grow we found out we were moving back to Denver. Investing too much time after that was a double edged sword, because as much as we love so many of or “Porch” friends, it was depressing knowing we were going to be moving away.  Some thoughts I had today:  This is why I feel like an "emergent snob" sometimes:  I was never an Evangelical Christian. I danced around that culture and denied that life for years, and finally came to Christ in the emergent church world just over 3 years ago.  When I see people like Brennan Manning or John Eldridge speak, I think "Duh"-why doesn't everyone get this?  When I saw the movie the village I thought-good message, but "Duh", of course people shouldn't try to live like that.  When I heard a guy speak at an Evangelical church in Denver a few weeks ago and he came to the profound conclusion that we should treat Janitors and Maids like people who are part of our community and actually find out what their names are I thought-"Duh".  Maybe it is my lack of an expanded vocabulary (especially compared to my Rachel), but I often think "Duh" in these situations.  Every time the pastor at the Church of The Open Door in Maple Grove says "Minneapolissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"I want to laugh out loud.  Why I am not an “emergent snob”:  I usually enjoy the messages at evangelical churches despite the bad music and inauthentic presentation.  I still talk to those people :).  My wife is a recovering evangelical (I may be in trouble for writing that).  I still try to get through to those people-I haven't given up.  I don't think they are going to hell-even if they think I am.  I like the movie "The passion of The Christ"-and think it really can be a good teaching tool, and I think it is a good movie for non-Christians to see.  I am officially a Republican-fiscally, but socially a Libertarian-no part of me is a Democrat.
