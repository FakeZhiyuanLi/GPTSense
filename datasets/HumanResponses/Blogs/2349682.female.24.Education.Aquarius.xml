      I got to see my friend Jen today! She and her husband are here from California, we (Erin and the kids, Mandy) had donuts and hot drinks this morning. I somehow forgot that I had school today at nine, but luckily my fellow classmate called and told me that class had been cancelled, I really lucked out because I wasn't even on my way! hee hee. I left our get together early because I had to finish some homework before the next class.  I found out today that I have to be in a different school next semester and also a different grade. I'm a little sad because there are so many reasons why I want to be at San Tan: the little girl that I take care of goes there (Brynn), the youngest Cornejo boys (Marc and Andy) also go there I've seen them in P.E. a couple of times, Tyler I have seen there he is a buddy for the younger kids, and also because I love the kids in my kindergarten class, I just love everything about that school. I understand that I have to try different grades and I understand that I need to get a feel for a different school but there is just something special about the connection I had with some of the youth group kids because I went to their school. Also my connection with Brynn because I get to see her at school. I know God will take care of me but it just seems so unfair!

      Tonight I got to sing for the Danny Daniels thing, it was neat. He didn't lead worship, I kind of was hoping that he would but I think he is doing that tommorrow. Anyways he was talking about spiritual gifts: the gift of healing, miracles, prophetic words ect. As he was talking I was thinking of a conversation that I had recently with my dad. He asked me if I wanted to go to a Benny Hinn ministry conference he's going to be in Phoenix in February, he said that it would be a great opportunity for me to get healed. Well I am not sure what I believe on his ministry, granted I don't know him, I can see that he does have a heart for God but I don't know if I can go to a place expecting healing, putting all my faith and hope in one event or time. So I told my dad I would pray about it. Well it has been bugging me for awhile, I just don't have a peace about it. But I don't want to hurt my dad either. So anyways Danny D was talking about people how they don't have the gift of healing they are given a gift of healing at that time, so it's not something you have for ever or one person can't have the gift of healing, it is all about God's doing, and if he chooses to use a person then awesome, praise God for it! So at the end he was talking about how he gets words of knowlegde for people or God uses him to speak to people. So I kind of prayed in my mind, "God please have Danny or someone else think of me or call me out so that I can get prayer." And no sooner did I finish when Danny said "someone is trying to play telephone with God, and he hears you." Wow God, you work fast! I got a tugging in my heart to ask Danny about what he thinks about the Benny Hinn minsitry or if he could help me be at peace. He told me he doesn't know Benny, he probally is a great guy. But if Benny heals at all it is because he gets a gift at that time or the people that are working with him get a gift of healing at that time. I finally just told him about what my dad said, and finally fessed up that I was going for a healing for myself.  I was almost in tears because I am so confused, and I hate telling people that I have arthritis. Well he asked if he could pray for me, by then I was crying and shaking. He said that he could see that I have lots of doubts and fears. Lots of questions, that he was going to pray for healing but that God would do it on his own time. He also prayed for peace about going to the conference. Yep I was still crying, but I feel relieved to tell someone, I was telling Andre just before I went up there, I'm so scared I don't know if I can ask, because I knew he would pray for me. But God is good, so good. He used Danny to reassure me that he's got my back, he will be my comfort and that he has been there through out my whole time having arthritis.

      I was in my intern class at San Tan this morning and it was interesting because the kids were just talking to me about everything you could imagine. We were doing centers and one little boy the only mexican in the class (vladimir) comes up and just hugs me, when I first met him I thought he didn't want anything to do with me, but today I was pleasantly surprised by his display of affection, I am almost in tears because it meant the world to me. And then a little while after that, he says, Ms. Cela I no no what I doing! He is a doll! OHH!I know he is just learning english but his accented english makes everything he says so cute! Another little girl told me that she was going to get a puppy, her parent's told her that she could. I asked her how long does it take to grow up? About twenty minutes she says matter of factly. If only that could be true! I've been asking for a puppy for awhile now, I am hoping for a christmas, birthday, graduation present with a puppy in a bow. I really want a Mastiff, but I know I have to be patience. The thing about a dog for me is that they demonstrate what unconditional love is all about, no matter what time you come home. They are loyal, great companions, they can protect you, and most of all they can be a part of the family. I am praying that someday I will get my Samson/Trinity whichever hopefully Samson. But until then I want to be thankful for what I do have: great parents, good school, great church, good jobs and a relationship with God.

      Today I was reminded of what God's love is like. No matter what you are going through he will take time to listen, love, and care for you because that is just how he is. I was kind of grumpy today for some reason and what I needed to do was pray before I went to take care of Brynn, I did a quick prayer but that was about it. Well Brynn decided it was going to be disagree with Cela day, I should have known. But even though in the beginning it was a little hard I just had to lay myself aside for a bit and think of Brynn, she needs me to be a role model not a drill sergeant or the evil nanny, she needs to be loved and cared for. My night ended up being good, I just had to refocus on what my heart was saying. Some verses that I am reminded of tonight are: Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on a tablet of your heart. Proverbs 3:3 The Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love. Psalm 146:11 How happy are those who know their need for God. Matthew 5:3 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourself. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patience in affliction, faithful in prayer. Romans 12:9-12

      So I am sitting here thinking how cool is this?! An online journal! I try to keep a regular journal but I don't think I have written in it for a long time.  I am thinking of the things that God has been doing in my life recently. I have been so blessed to be able to go to ASU East's education program, I love it, I didn't realize that being a teacher is so much work. The plus is ultimately you get to see kids grow and learn, also you are able to give them love and support that they might not be getting at home, that to me is so worth all the time spent learning and figuring out how to be the best teacher there is. Let's see I have been praying for a long time to find a job that has good hours that I would enjoy doing. I found through the HOPE Program a couple of good jobs but once I started with a family I still couldn't get a consistant schedule, and that was hard because I only got payed once a month and gas money wasn't there. God heard my plea thankfully (it's funny because I was starting to think that he just didn't hear me) maybe it was also because I actually started to do something about this situation. Well Brenda has a nanny agency and it worked out that this one family needed someone. This job is such a blessing, not only for financial reasons but because the mom is trying to figure out stuff about God and I get to share with her some of my feelings. Also I get a chance to work on my cooking skills, try new recipes, learn how to become a wife of nobility. One more thing for the night, I am so blessed to be a part of the Gilbert Vineyard. There are so many amazing people there, I loved this church even before  the merge and now I get to love it more. Tonight in youth, I was reminded of how much I totally love having both East Valley youth and Gilbert youth as one. Allyson as you might know is like the hip I don't have, hee hee. She totally blesses me, but tonight as she was singing I was thinking of how the angels worship Jesus, and I think it would be similar to how Allyson worships. I was looking around and had to smile (with pride) because I saw Kristen and Liz lifting their hands worshipping. It is so neat to see teenagers lay all their cares aside and give their all to God. It is so beautiful, they are so beautiful because of it. And as a leader I am so proud of the growth that these youth are experiencing. I should go now but I just want to say that I am so blessed, and sometimes I forget all that God is doing in my life but as I write I can see that he is so good and faithful, thanks God. YOUR AWESOME! Cela

      Happy Christmas Eve! I can't believe that Christmas is only a couple of hours away. I have been so blessed these couple of days, getting cards and gifts from unexpected people. It's nice to know that you are cared about. Like for instance Brynn and her mom have blessed me so much these last couple of days. They got me a box of chocolate covered strawberries from California, then they got me a gift box of bath and body works with the lotion, bath gel, etc. Then on top of all of that Brynn and two of her friends offered to washed my car today and did!  We went to a Christmas party tonight that was for the cousins on my moms side, I had fun with mom and my friend Jason getting a new outfit. Jason called me up today to see what I was doing, since he is studying to be a doctor at U of A he comes to Phoenix every once in awhile and when he does we go to the mall, it is quite funny. He told me that he is actually going to go spend time with our good friend Jojo in London for the break, I was like no fair! I want to go hang out with you too! Oh I have to share a dream I had a couple of days ago: I dreamt that I was driving in the car with my parents, I fell out of the car and rolled onto a grassy area, a black and white dog came by and started biting and attacking me. I am normally not afriad of dogs but this dog terrified me! I was so scared of him! My dad saw how scared I was and sent me to a pyscho ward, I was in the building and I couldn't find my dad. I called him but he didn't answer, then there were lots of people coming in making lots of noise and I just sat down screaming my dad's name but he wasn't there, he left me there. For some reason I have been thinking about this a lot and I start getting teary eyed. I told my mom and she had my dad come in my room to tell him. I told him about the dream and then he said this: Cela, the day I took you to Remuda and they had to stick a tube up your nose was the worst day in my life. To see my daughter with fear in her eyes and I can't do anything about it is the worst feeling in the world, plus having to leave you there at that moment was so hard. I didn't even think of that situation, but I started crying. He prayed for me, and then said, you wouldn't have been scared of the dog if your mastiff was with you, huh? I said no, it would have attacked him! Anyways, it was a crazy dream. Well I am going to watch It's a Wonderful Life with my family. I love Christmas time!

      I am totally baked out with week, I made ginger bread cookies yesterday along with the walls and roof of a gingerbread house, all from scratch mind you, woo wee I am dreaming about baking. It's funny though because as soon as I was done with the cookies I went to Brynn's to make her dinner, my place is in the kitchen and I am not even married yet! Putting up the walls in my gingerbread house was a test of my patience let me tell you, I couldn't figure out how to make the walls stick up and not fall down,  I think I screamed a couple of times out of frustration. Anyways, I finally figured out to put cardboard to help the walls stay up, it's worked I'm a genius! Just kidding. So tonight I really didn't have anything planned for dessert so I remembered that we still had cookie dough. It's so funny that even though there weren't very many youth at group tonight they were all very grateful for dessert. Rob even said that whoever I marry is going to be one lucky man because he will get the best dessert and food. Isn't that nice of him to say? Where is that man though is my question? I get told things like this all the time, ok Lord help me be patience, I can wait I really can! Luke totally blessed me tonight because he didn't even make the dessert but he was willing to clean up after us, what a great servant. And two other great servants were Jake R. and Z-Diddy! They helped pass out the dessert and where gracious enough to finish off the dessert that we had left, what neat hearts they have! :)

      I took my car to get an emission test today, I was so nervous! Silly thing to worry about, I think it was because Daddy said something about IF my car passes the test, then something but IF NOT then we will have to get it fixed. I just didn't want the have to get my car fixed again or have it not pass. So I went to Walmart to go get my angel tree gift, I got distracted: my foster brother is coming next week and he likes skateboards so I got him two mini skateboards to decorate his room with. Then I found a cool gift for my brother. I left and then realized I totally forgot my angel tree gift! Luckily there was another store on the way home that had what she wanted. I picked up Brynn early today and we made chicken enchiladas for dinner, she turned on the radio and said lets dance! So I started dancing with her then she says be the audience silly! Oh well you forgot to tell me that one! So she danced for one song and then it was my turn, it was kind of fun. Girl's group tonight was fun, we made fajitas for the girls. I was embarrassed because my tortillas were flaky. It was cute because Kristen brought after dinner mints, she was really trying to say that we had STINKY breath, but in a polite way. So I have a prayer request: I need prayer that I will be more compassionate and loving towards my brother. We haven't been getting along lately and it's not good for the either of us. I am making him not want to be at home. I don't want to be known as the evil "real" sister, and I don't want to have my brother hate me. I want to show him love I just don't know how sometimes. I get more on his nerves than I do getting to really show my love. So Lord, I please pray that you will be in this situation. I pray that you will give me your love to pour onto my brother and to back off when the I need to back off. Help my words and actions be that of love and not of condemnation or judgment. I pray that my brother will someday trust me enough to want to confide in me with things and that we will be able to love each other like we are supposed to. Lord please forgive me for being a jerk. You know I don't mean the things I say, they just come out wrong. I pray that my brother will realize that too, please be with him tonight Lord and please let him know that you love him so much. Thanks.

      I am so tired today, I didn't get much sleep last night because I spent the night at Brynn's house. I wasn't tired when we came home at ten so I decided to watch Sleepless in Seattle. It made me cry, man I am getting weaker crying at the bat of an eye, hee hee. No its not getting weaker cuz I  am dealing with emotions, right? Whatever, so her cat was attacking me all night, he kept trying to cuddle with me, normally it would be cool, but I'm allergic! I could feel myself getting itchy and teary eyed. I ended up going to bed at one, very good movie by the way. I normally don't admit to watching girly movies but you all caught me! So to make things more interesting the house was so cold I thought I turned up the heater but I  was freezing! I had at least three blankets and was still cold, I think it was 62 degrees in the house, no wonder!  So needless to say I was getting up every hour to check the heater and the kitty kept bothering me, isn't it all lovely. And then sweet Brynn gets up at 5:30 a.m. and is ready to play. God sure does have a great sense of humor. Brynn at the Christmas party got a  picture frame that had the words friends on it, so she wanted to find a picture of her an her mom having a good time having fun. We found a cool picture of them by a waterfall it was perfect with the green background. Today at church I was shocked to have Allyson come up with blond hair in the front of her head, she looked a little like Rogue from the Xmen. I shouldn't have been surprised because she told me on Thursday that she was going to do it. It will take a little getting used to but that's fine. So after lunch with Hannah, I came home and first went to the couch to watch football with the boys but I was asleep even before the first play, then I went to bed to sleep for a total of three hours. I really needed that. So it was dinner time, and there was a great Sylvester Stallone movie, demolition Man! When I was in my bed there was a gangster movie, called Amongst Friends that was on, it was great. My brothers said that they think it is funny that I like those kind of movies, like it is out of character for me or something. Well they are some things that are shocking about Cela, that is one of them! Well it must be a movie night for me because the boys just got The Gladiator, another one of my favorites! Hooray! Have a good night!

      Tonight in my educational psychology class I realized that some people are just so mean! We did a presentation last week on  different types of disorders I had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the other three girls had RAD, ADD, and ADHD. We did a game as kind of an icebreaker, it didn't really relate to what we were talking about but it was fun. So anyways, we get our evaluation/critique from our fellow classmates, it was funny because one person said that the game had nothing to with the presentation so that was distracting, another person said that me and my friend weren't dressed professional enough, (I had on nice jeans a nice shirt but I was wearing my jacket sorry but I get cold, I shouldn't have to explain or justify my actions) I think it is just silly though one person said that we were looking at the power point too much and that we didn't know how to spell. I don't know what kind of mood some people were in that night but seriously, how hurtful! I mean we are supposed to be building each other up, encouraging one another, not breaking our spirits and tearing us down. My group members were ready to go in the class and see who said those things, they started talking bad about the people who wrote those things, I couldn't join in because I knew that would be wrong too, I tried to be like hey guys it's just a couple of people. I just want to pray for those people instead of getting angry. Lord, if I have offended someone in my class or have done something that they didn't like forgive me. I pray for the people who said hurtful things to our group, Father I pray that you will give them an extra dose of your love. Let them know that regardless of their actions or words they are still precious in your eyes.

      I was going through my hopeless chest tonight trying to find pictures of my famile for Brynn's mom to see, and I found some of the pictures that Nik and I took together. I really miss her, I know she is going through a tough time right now but I wish that I could be there with her to help her get through everything. I was thinking of writing her a letter and it would go something like this: Nik, Hey there, I am just writing to say hi and that I really miss you. I have been praying for you ever since your mom called me. I wish I could take away what happened but God has a purpose for everything even though we may not understand it. I want to tell you though that I am not going to feel differently about you or condemn you in anyway, I just want to love you but I will give you space so that you can handle this in your own way. I also want to tell you that in order to feel forgiveness you have to forgive yourself, I can't imagine how hard it is to go through something like this but the family has forgiven you, God has forgiven you, it's time for you to forgive you. I know there is no quick solution to make you better so I will continue to pray. I hope though that this isn't the end of our friendship, I hope that you someday will let me back into your life, I hope that if need be I can cry with you, pray with you, or just sit in silence with you. I miss having you as a friend, and it kills me that I can't do more to help you out. I love you so much, I always have and always will. I pray that God will give you the strength to make it through each day. I pray that when you wake up in the morning  you don't dread the day, but will embrace it because there are so many different opportunities to be blessed. I pray that you will always know that God is with you and he loves you. Take care my friend, you are in my prayers. Cela

      I was thinking today as I said goodbye to the kids at my internship of how Jesus must of loved and cared for the kids. Ms. Denne my teacher told the kids that this was going to be my final day. All the kids came around me and started to hug me, saying goodbye, and that they will miss me. I was thinking for a brief moment, oh no is this ok, can I let them hug me? But I was like this is how they are showing their affection, I don't care what happens I am going to let these kids love on me because I care about each and every one. They all started saying that they love me and are going to miss me, one said I will miss you but I'm not going to be sad. I said, I will! I almost cried because two of the little boys where trying to lock me with pretend handcuffs so that I wouldn't go away. How precious is that?! I was totally blessed by the kids, I am so glad that I went back.

      I am so excited finals are almost over! YEAH! Then it's only three more semesters and I am done with school, well for a little while anyways. But it is nice to finally get to say that I get to graduate. It seems like this process is and has been taking so long. I guess though that surgeries are kind of important and taking off school was probally the best thing to do, but still. I am really going to miss my kindergarten class, I know I've said that already but I didn't get a chance to properly say goodbye. I'm going to go in tommorrow to pick up my evalutions and tell the kids that I will miss seeing them. I feel like I'm going to cry, they were such a great group. I know that this happens with teachers but I don't know if I can handle it. I think I am just going to be a big baby at the end of each school year because I won't get to see the kids in my class again. I am very excited though about my nanny job, Brynn's mom is asking me so many questions about life and different things about me it is neat because I can share with her the little I know and my different life experiences which has been quite a bit for a 23 year old. The most exciting to me was in the beginning she was afraid to pray with me and Brynn before dinner and now she isn't shy anymore because I'm kind of like one of the family. I love it when Brynn says that I am a part of the family, makes me feel special. I get in these silly moods sometimes and I asked Brynn every ten minutes or so, "have I told you in the last three or four minutes that I love you?" hee hee, she rolls her eyes and says, "yes, you told me like a billion times!" Sometimes I wish that I wrestle and run around the house with her but I get scared because of my hip. I have dreams sometimes that I am running on an open field or a track and it feels so good to be able to run, to not be sick anymore. Some day though I will be able to do that again, I know because I have a God who watches out for me, who tells me to not give up hope. I am just building my perservance and it's fun to share war stories with older people, oh honey you don't even know what pain is! Oh yeah? Try me, ha ha. Anyways, I need to keep practicing my song for Sunday. Lord thanks for being so merciful and good to me, you have carried me through a lot of different battlefields, I know you have a plan and purpose for my life, help me to follow you in everything I do, say, and think.  I love you Daddy.

      Well we are off to a wonderful week so far! I can't believe it is already December. My mother surprised us all yesterday by taking out the tree (artifical), putting up the lights, and decorating the house! Last year we didn't put up the tree till a couple of days before Christmas, I like this way though because I am actually looking forward to Christmas this year. I took my grandparent's out for lunch today, I called my grandma last week to see if she was available today and she didn't even look at her calendar she says, "is 11:30 good for you?"hee hee. We went to Souper Salad which is one of their favorite places to eat. My grandpa kept saying, God has a special place in heaven for you Cela. I didn't want to be like I know he does and get all prideful, ya know? I just smiled and said that taking them out to eat is just something that I like doing, he was fine with that answer. It made me think though, is there things in my life that I do just to say I do stuff like that? For instance do I nanny or take care of kids to make myself look good or to build myself up? Or do I help out with things at church or the youth just to say that I am on a ministry team? I hope not, that to me seems like I think I am all that and more and that's not at all what I am trying to say. I just want to do what God wants me to do in my life, and right now those things are what's in my life. I really don't want it to be about me, I am just trying to do what God does, bless his children! Besides working with youth and kids is a very humbling experience because you can't get away with anything, they will tell you how it is whenever they feel like it! Grandparent's do that too. And when I find myself getting prideful or whatever God is always there to gently remind me, "honey it is so not about you! (hee hee) It's so all about me, give the credit where the credit is due! I love you silly girl!" I love God for that reason.

      Transformed by Trouble  For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs glory that far outweighs them all. 2 Corinthians 4:17  It is the fire of suffering that brings forth the gold of godliness. Madame Guyana  God has a purpose behind every problem. He uses circumstances to develop outer character. Jesus warned us that we would have problems in this world. No one is immune to pain or insulated from suffering, and no one gets to skate through life problem-free. Peter says, "don't be bewildered or surprised when you go through the fiery trials ahead, for this is no strange, unusual thing that is going to happen to you." God uses problems to draw you closer to himself. The Bible says, "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, he rescues those who are crushed in spirit." Your most profound and intimate experiences of worship will likely be in your darkest days, when your heart is broken, when you feel abandoned, when you're out of options, when the pain is great- and you turn to God alone. It is during suffering that we learn to pray our most authentic, heartfelt, honest-to-God prayers. When we're in pain, we don't have the energy for superficial prayers. Problems force us to look to God and depend on him instead of ourselves. Regardless of the cause, none of your problems could happen without God's permission. Everything that happens to a child of God is Father-Filtered, and he intends to use it for good even when Satan and others mean it for bad. God is sovereignly in control, accidents are just incidents in God's good plan for you. Because every day of your life was written on God's calendar before you were born, everything that happens to you has a spiritual significance.   We know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to  his purpose for them. For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son. Romans 8:28-29  We are like jewels, shaped with the hammer and chisel of adversity. If a jeweler's hammer isn't strong enough to chip off our rough edges, God will use a sledgehammer. If we're really stubborn, he uses a jackhammer. He will use whatever it takes. Every problem is a character-building opportunity, and the more difficult it is, the greater the potential or building spiritual muscle and moral fiber.  "We know that these troubles produce patience. And patience produces character." What happens outwardly in your life is not as important as what happens inside you. Your circumstances are temporary, but your character will last forever.  Problems don't automatically produce what God intends. Many people become bitter, rather than better, and never grow up. You have to respond the way Jesus would. Remember that God's plan is good. God knows what is best for you and has your best interests at heart. The secret of endurance is to remember that your pain is temporary but your reward eternal. Rejoice and give thanks. God doesn't expect you to be thankful for evil, for sin, for suffering, or for their painful conscquences in the world. Instead, God wants you to thank him that he will use your problems to fulfill his purposes. No matter what's happening, you can rejoice in God's joy at that time, because you have a great reward waiting for you in heaven. We can also rejoice in knowing that God is going through the pain with us. We don't serve a distant and detached God who spouts encouraging cliches safely from the sideline. Instead, he enters into our suffering.  Refuse to give up. Be patient and persistent. Let the process go on until your endurance is fully developed, and you will find that you have become men of mature character.. With no weak spots. Character building is a slow process. Whenever we try to avoid or escape the difficulties in life, we short circuit the process, delay our growth, and actually end up with a worse kind of pain, the worthless type that accompanies denial and avoidance. You know you are maturing when you begin to see the hand of God in the random, baffling, and seemingly pointless circumstances of life. You need to stick it out, staying with God's plan so you'll be there for the promised completion. Don't give up-grow up! Purpose Driven Life

      I usually am an animal lover but I have gotten so annoyed at Brynn's cat. The cat comes and wants to be petted while I am making dinner, it will actually step on my food and I am like, "hello? can't you see I am doing something here?" One time the cat tried to drink out of a boiling pot of water!! I make fish sometimes for dinner or chicken and the cat will sit at the table waiting for his portion, or when we aren't looking he will just jump onto the table and start eating the food. I pray that I will have more patience but I thought cats were supposed to be smart. I try to love the thing but I kind of am allergic to it so when he sits on my head and sleeps its not really fun for me. I'm trying I really am, I don't know what else to do. So today was the Schustinators birthday I got the honor of taking her out for lunch, she's so awesome. Friends like her are a rare thing. She loves her new Malibu and was so happy that I got a chance to ride in it. I wanted to go to McClintock to drop off a card for Allyson but the lady at the office said that I had to get a parent's permission slip, I was like you got to be kidding me?! So I couldn't bless Allyson at school, I was so bummed, I so wanted her to feel specail at school today.  Well we had spaghetti for lunch I remembered that Jenny likes spaghetti for lunch (not dinner), it was good. She's fun to talk to. I like talking with her about dogs and her turtles, she just lights up. Well Jenny was nice enough to come with me to Allyson's dad's to drop off her card, luckily her dad and stepmom were home, so we talked to them for a bit, they wished Jenny a happy birthday which was nice, they thought I was Allyson's age or at least her dad did. I get that a lot probally because I use a lot of lotion and it makes me look younger (we'll just say that's what it is, k?). But I was glad that he said at least Allyson's age and not 10 like Joel the sound guy thought I was. 10?! You got to be joking!! It's just funny because everybody says that I will be happy when I am 50 because I will still look young, that's great so tell me when I am 50, not now. I am glad Gabe is doing something fun for his birthday, and I really love that it is a dance party. Mom said that I could invite Moses, Jose, Jojo, Jason, etc. She's so funny she loves to party just like us.  I hope that we get a good turn out because Gabe is a special guy, I am so proud of that guy. He is awesome, I have gotten to talk to him more lately, and I see that he has an awesome heart. I love it that he calls people to see if they have been reading their bible or for the guys accountability. He's great and I am not just saying that cuz he's my brother.

      Christmas and New Year's went by so fast!! Wow, it's already 2004. I graduate next year! YEAH! Once again I was blessed by Brynn and her mom, they called from Kentucky to wish me a Merry Christmas and also to see if I got my puppy. Well I didn't get my puppy unfortuneately but it was a sweet thing to call. I really tried not to be to disappointed when my gift wrapped puppy didn't come, but I couldn't help it. I was so sure he was coming this year. But I did get a Mastiff calendar from Santa (a.k.a Cela). It was nice to see all the family this holiday, my great aunt Carmen was here so we hung out with my grandma and her two sisters (one which is Aunt Carmen), it's so funny when they get together because they bring out a bottle wine and it is finished by the end of the night. Hilarious, they are so funny.  So I was asked the other day if I would do a musical for the youth group, I am getting really excited about it. I watched Jesus Christ Superstar, and I love it! I can't wait to get started! I got some background music for the play so I won't have to hire a band. So I just have to learn the songs myself and start thinking about who will be best for which part, and start auditions. What fun!! How cool we are going to do a musical! Gabe said that he would sing for me, and Amber said that she could dance as long as she doesn't have to sing. Awesome!

       Subject: Just Because....T. D. Jakes     Just because someone may not have realized what a gold  mine you are,  doesn't mean you shine any less.  Just because someone may not have realized that you can't be topped, doesn't stop you from being the best.  Just because no one has come along to share your life,  doesn't mean that day isn't coming.  Just because no one has made this race worthwhile, doesn't  give you permission to stop running.  Just because no one has realized how much of an awesome woman you are, doesn't mean they can affect your femininity.  Just because no one has shown up who can love you on  your level, doesn't mean you have to sink to theirs.  Just because you deserve the very best there is, doesn't mean that life is always fair. Just because God is still preparing your king, doesn't mean that you're not  already a Queen.  Just because your situation doesn't seem to be progressing right now,  doesn't mean you need to change a thing. Keep shining,  Keep running, Keep hoping, Keep praying, Keep being exactly what you are  already . .  COMPLETE!!

      I got to go out tonight!! We went to the mall, woo hoo! I was totally getting ready for a night with pizza and a movie but Cassy asked if we could go to the mall so she could hang out with her friends, that's the only way she could go out. Well I had a fifty dollar gift certificate from the Chandler mall so I was like sure. I got an outfit (jeans and a shirt with a scarf) lotion at Bath and Body, and makeup at Clinque. I think I did pretty well if I say so myself. Cassy went to go see 50 first dates with a friend, and I was people watching for an hour. I can't believe some of the lines that guys use to pick up girls, I wanted to go ask them if those lines actually worked by I decided not to because I didn't want to be given a line.  I just keep hearing Don't Hate, Don't Hate! I don't hate the player, I just hate the game, cuz that's all it is. Granted friday nights are junior high beginning of high school nights at the mall but still. It was sad to see these junior high/high school girls dressing to express but impressing the wrong kind of guys. I just had to sit and pray for a bit because I could have started to cry, or gotten really mad. But I like Cassy's friends they keep it real! They were very nice to me even though I am the old one. And afterwards Cassy started talking a lot more to me! I guess it just shows you that you kind of have to go and play on their level a bit. Well I am glad that we had this week because now I can understand a little bit more of how the youth's lives are like and what they go through during a week. And how to take someone not talking as a challenge instead of a cut down to you, you really can't be offended that teenagers don't talk, they just don't know what to talk about and sometimes we don't either! I am glad that I had this experience and that I didn't give up.

      I am thinking that if I ever move out I don't want to live by myself, it's just so lonely. Like I am taking care of my neighbors friends daughter, so I am at staying with her all this week. But I have had to cancel a lot of my activies during the week to make sure I am here when she is here. So when she is at school or soccer practice I am here all alone, well they have a dog but he just likes to sleep in the girl's bed, or he just barks all the time. No fun. I am trying to look at the good in this all because I am helping this family out but, I just don't like being at home all the time. I miss my friends, I miss my brother's and parent's, and I didn't even go somewhere far, I'm just down the street! I think I have called my parent's almost every night to see if they miss me yet, pathetic isn't it? I am also thinking that when I get my dog, I want to train him to bark at only certain things like someone at the door not when people are just walking down the street or me when I am getting out of bed. It's funny to me that I am like this missing home and all. I think that my best shot would be moving out when I get married, or rooming with a friend, other than that I don't like the idea of coming home to no one. I think it will also be different when I get my own dog too because I will no doubtingly want to come home to him cuz he's my baby! I will have something to look forward to coming home to! I guess it just takes a week of not being home to make you realize how blessed you really are, and how important it is to keep in touch with family and friends. Thanks God for the reminder!

      A very sad thing happened this week, Kitty Brynn's cat died. I feel awful because just previously I was saying how annoying she was. But ever since they moved into their new house Kitty has been really good, and I have enjoyed having her around, we even had her model for us so we could draw her. I wish I could take back what I said about her but I can't, she's gone. I really did like her, I did. Just makes me think about life, like if there is anyone that I have thought bad things about or has bad things thought about me, and if that isn't resolved how awful that feels.  Brynn's grandparent's were here for a couple of weeks, it was fun. I came over but all I had to do was play with Brynn. No problem! It's cool because I really like talking to her grandma, she makes me feel like one of the family, I should say they all do, it's like having a family of my own outside of home, and it feels great to know that you are wanted and belong there.Throughout the weeks I have been able to get to know Grandma and also help Shara with some stuff that she is going through as well. It's weird how stuff that she is going through right now is stuff that I have been through already, the weird thing is that we both know that we were placed in each others lives for a reason. This was a God thing totally. I am so excited to see what's happening in that house. I have been realizing more and more lately that I really need to take time to get myself fed, I do a lot for others but really haven't taken me time. I know that I need to but between Brynn and the different stuff going on I just haven't been able to find a bible study that works. They don't have bible studies that start at 7:30ish, it's too late. I am still praying though, I might start looking into different churches bible groups. I just pray that I can find one.

      What a fun day it's been! I got to go to school at 7:00 this morning, which is the hardest thing to do because I don't learn well when I'm sleepy, but I also got some homework done (yeah being productive, I prayed in our group on Sunday that those of us who are in school wouldn't be procrastinators) and I got to go shopping! I was so happy because I needed to books for my Literature class so I went to Barnes and Noble well I thought that I had only 7 dollars on a certificate that I had so I would pay three dollars for my books, but I had 17! Not like it is a real big deal but I didn't have to pay! One kiss from the King. And then I went to Abecrombie because once again I thought I had 7 dollars on my certifcate so I got a cute shirt from the kids abercrombie, they have clothes that fit me which is sad. Anyways I got another kiss from the King because I again had 17 dollars so I ended up paying a dollar which is awesome!  I am so excited because my mom's birthday is coming up, my dad and I set up a day of relaxing and treatements at Dolce Salon and Spa, and I get to get a facial too! It will be fun mom/daughter time, maybe we will make a beautiful moment of our own. hee hee.  Gabe had an award ceremony tonight for making all state for Soccer, it was nice because his coach who is also the english teacher wrote a descriptive paragragh of how Gabe was such an awesome leader and player. It made us proud that Gabe got such an honor. I was trying not to sit to close to him at the dinner because we don't like people to think we are dating, ha ha. Then he takes my hand and kisses it or sits closer just because. Silly boy.

      Wow, lots of stuff happening this week. Danny just told me that I'm not going to singing this quarter and possibly ever again. He said that there are so many singers so he has to not use some of them. He said that it didn't have anything to do with my singing ability. I just want to cry though because I looked forward to my times singing with the worship team, I really enjoyed getting to know each and every one of them. I just feel like I am losing something so precious to me. I still can sing with the youth so that is comforting but what happens when I am to old for that? I almost already am. Well here we go onto a different phase of my life, and I want to keep my head up and trust God that though this isn't easy he knows what he is doing. Lord: please help me to trust you for everything that is going on but especially for my job and singing with the worship team.

      I am reminded everyday how God really has my hopes and desires in his mind. Even though it seems like a lonely time, I am reminded of people who do love me a lot. I have had friendship restored and that is such a blessing.  And no matter what I know that Jojo, Jason, and Jose will always be there for me.  What I love about Jason is that he is very motivated: he is studying to be a doctor he said when we were at Grand Canyon that he wasn't going to have a girlfriend until after he graduates med school, and all three of the boys said that but Jason is the only one to follow through. And he is the best shopper ever, I like going to the mall with him so he can tell me what looks good or suggest a new outfit idea, and he calls whenever he is free just to see how I'm doing. Jose: I can always talk to him about whats going on in life and different stuff like that. It hasn't happened recently because he is a busy man now, but we used to have a tradition of seeing each other for Cinco de Mayo and New Year's Eve. My favorite thing to do with him is to go dancing because he is amazing, and even though I can't dance as well as he does he makes me feel like I am the greatest dancer ever. I will never forget the time when all three of them came to Remuda when I was in treatment to have a worship session with me, that was so special. Jojo: he calls me his sister and if I had an older brother I would want him to be like Jojo. We could do everything and anything together and not get bored. I remember at school once where we sat in the piano room for at least three hours, Jojo and I would play worship music or he would teach me a song in his language (Ghanian?). He said that when he gets married he wants the woman's name to be Destiny Eve. Because destiny will bring them together and Eve was the name of the first woman. Jojo called me today and he told me about a dream he had a couple of nights ago: I (Jojo) was studying by the pool and this girl walks up to me and says she's looking for her Jojo. I hadn't told her my name so I thought that was kind of strange. I was trying to study so I really couldn't talk but I couldn't keep my eyes off of her. She then got nervous and asked what I was looking at, I told her "I can't keep my eyes off you!" "What's your name?" She said, "Destiny, my names Destiny." I couldn't hide my joy! After awhile I took her to Cela's house and introduced her to Destiny, well Cela heard that name and started jumping up and down, "your the one!" Even though it was only a dream Jojo says that it gives him a reason to hope. I told him that if he ever does bring Destiny over I think I will either scream or start crying with joy, he said he already knew that. hee hee. I love my three J's, and I am glad that God has kept them in my life.

      Here at the house we just shared a beautiful moment together. Dad got some cigars while he was in California this last weekend and he told the boys as a special treat that they would smoke them together. I don't know but just to see the boys get so excited to try smoking a cigar with dad was so great! It was cute how they were making smoke rings and taking pictures. Like I said it was a beautiul moment of father/son bonding time. Daddy let me try the cigar but I got laughed at because I got the smallest amount possible and when I tried to make a smoke ring I just made a poof, it was funny but I didn't like the taste, eww! Then after all that happened we sat and prayed as a family. I like times like that they are what life is all about.

      We talked about taking risks today, I think a risk for me right now would be to allow someone to become a friend to me. I'm so scared that I will give all that I can to make them feel special and important only to be hurt and disappointed in the end by them leaving or not caring for me as much as I do them. Does that make sense? I hope so.

      I was let go today of my nannying job, it's kind of strange. I am happy because Shara wants to become a mom for reals now, and that's the best thing she could do for Brynn. But I am sad because I won't be able to be with Brynn anymore, if I'd of known that I wouldn't be seeing her again I would have given her an extra hug. I don't think that she will be out of my life whatsoever. It's funny because they were trying to find someone to work on Sundays to take care of Brynn, I pretended to cry and said "why do you want to replace me?!" And now she is the only one who gets to take care of Brynn since she is available on Sundays. I hope that she loves Brynn a lot.  I will miss that family, I knew that God put me there for a reason even if it was only for a little while. I will still be in touch with them, maybe invite them to church once in awhile. Lord, I pray that you will be with Brynn and Shara, help Shara learn how to love her little girl like she deserves to be loved. Help Brynn grow up to be an awesome woman of God, and I pray that Shara will become a leader in her house. I give them both up to you to watch and protect, thanks for letting me be apart of their lives for a little while.

      It's midnight and I can't sleep, I hate it when that happens. Lately it has been happening more and more. Silly reasons, like a stuffy nose and not being able to breathe at night or hearing Baunders collar as she walks in the house, or an intense itchy spell where I am scratching all night, I wonder if God is trying to tell me something. Maybe he wants me to be praying or something during those times.  It has been a relaxing break though, almost to relaxing to the point where I am almost getting lazy. Been reading and watching movies. I also figured out how to make a Caribbean passion drink like at Jamba Juice, well Hannah and I discovered that last weekend. I have been realizing lately how important it is to have a good set of friends and fellowship, I've been a little out of the loop lately because I have a job that has me work nights (well part of the night) and I feel like I am missing something. Sometimes I ask my brother if I can go hang out with the guys at guys group which is silly because it's a guy's group, I just want to have friends too! I am excited about starting a girl's group of our own soon with Hannah, I think that will help with the fellowship with girl's my age and getting fed spiritually. I miss having someone to pray and cry with, or just to tell about my day. I miss times of hanging out with nothing to talk about but still we end up talking forever. I miss Sharon and Jen. I miss Nicole. It hurts when people who are so dear to you leave for whatever reason, I know though that real friends love at all times no matter where they are. I'm getting to know my family better though through this which is an amazing blessing. The other day Gabe out of the blue came up and asked me about something that was bothering him. Mom and I can talk about almost anything, I go and help her in her classroom now which is so much fun because those kindergarten kids show me that kids have a special place in God's heart. Andre and I like watching trading spaces or ambush makeover together, don't tell him I said that. :) It's fun because we get lots of ideas for looking good and making your house look good too! Dad is such an awesome man, he has been making it a point to take Andre and I to lunch every week or one of us at least  and that is his time to see how we are doing, and to see what he can pray for us about. At that 4f group the other night something that I thought was really neat was that all the kids got with their parents and prayed for each other. I know that my mom and dad pray for me all the time and I don't know what I would do if they didn't. Their prayers are keeping me going, and what better way to show love? It's just awesome. Well I am sleepy (didn't I say that already?) so I better try and rest. I want to go and see if my Ruthie is still around at the nursing home tomorrow, I haven't been there in forever because I am afraid that she won't be there when I come, but death isn't a bad thing, especially if you are 92. I just pray that I can see her before she goes to tell her that I love her so much and how much joy she brought into my life even though I am just a kid in her eyes, she is another one of those people that have blessed me more than I have her.

      I feel so unworthy at times to even call your name You went through so much suffered and died, and even if it ws only me you still would make that choice Why do I worship? Because you are my everything,  you are the only one who shows what unconditional love is all about. You are the only one who would willingly die for me. If that isn't deserving of worship I don't know what  is.

      I get so excited when youth step up to the bat and do stuff that are out of the ordinary for them. Tonight when Zach and Jake were praying I felt so proud of them like they had just won a medal of honor in the army or something like that. As I was talking to Hannah about it later I just wanted to cry, I love it that these youth are going to be the future men of our church. I love it that now they can pray to God and not worry about what their peers will think and even if they do care they were willing to pray anyways. I love it that they are being men and showing us how cool it is to be a man following God.

      Two classes done with, two more to go. Right on! I so need a break! Well for a couple of weeks I will get to sleep in then I will be working. I think I have all A's for my ASU classes. I know I am not getting an A in lecture for geology, I just hate taking written tests. Those are the worst for me. But I am getting an A in lab which is good, means I am kind of getting it.  There is this one girl in my lecture for geology she sits next to me, we talk all the time, I asked her what she was doing for he weekend and she says she was going to ask someone out on a date. I was like "Wow a bold woman, who is the lucky guy?" Well under her breath she was like, "I date women" so I tried not to show my shock but I don't think I did a good job. I then started feeling uncomfortable but then I was thinking what would Jesus do in this situation, he would love her no matter what right? So I am trying to show her God's love but now she is sick and hasn't been coming to class. I hope she's ok, I hope that I didn't offend her somehow.

      My family and I went to a wedding today, it was a beautiful ceremony. It was a lady that Andre and my parent's know from the YMCA. The guy actually sang to his girl, it was in spanish so I didn't understand what he was saying very well, but his wife's name is Flor or Flower and he was thanking God in the song for giving us Flowers. It was awesome! Me and my brothers were planning for the future, it was kind of funny. Gabe said he is going to be real good at piano by then so he will play a song for us my husband and I. Andre says that he wants to scuba dive for the reception dinner in his wedding which will be lobsters, yeah right that's a lot of lobster! It's just funny talking about getting married and stuff like that when you don't even have someone in your life yet. The odd thing about this wedding though was that they didn't give rings and they didn't dance at the end. No dancing! I couldn't believe it because they are Mexicans! Oh well.  It was still a good reception.

      What is Love?  A group of professional people posted this question to a group of 4-8 year olds. "What does love mean?" The answers they got were broad and deeper than anyone could have imagined:  When my grandma got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandpa does it for her now all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love.  Rebecca - age 8   When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You just know that your name is safe in their mouths.  Billy-age 4   Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving Cologne and they go out and smell each other.  Kari- age 5   Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French Fries without making them give you any of theirs.  Chrissy- age 6   Love is what makes you smile when you're tired.  Terri- age 4   Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK.  Danny- age 7   Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more. My mommy and daddy are like that.  They look gross when they kiss.  Emily- age 8   Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen.  Bobby- age 7   If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate.  Nikka- age 6   Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday.  Noelle- age 7   Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well.  Tommy- age 6   During my piano recital, I was on stage and I was scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore.  Cindy- age 8   My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night.  Clare- age 6   Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken.  Elaine- age 5   Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford.  Chris- age 7   Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day.  Mary Ann- age 4   When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars  come out of you.  Karen- age 7   Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and doesn't think it's gross.  Mark- age 6   You really shouldn't say "I LOVE YOU" unless you mean it. But if you  mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget.  Jessica- age 8    And the winner was a 4 year old child whose next door neighbor was an elderly man who had just lost his wife. When the child saw the man cry, the little boy went over into the man's yard and climbed on top of the man's lap and just sat there. When the boy's mother asked him what he'd said to the neighbor, the little boy said, "Nothing, I just helped him cry." I love you!

      I've been thinking lately about life and why things happen the way they do. It's all for a reason I know, but wouldn't it be nicer if could see the layout or plans ahead of us? I guess then God wouldn't have a way to have us completely trust him. Maybe that's why we can't know right away, it's cool though when we do see why things had to be the way they were to see what God had ahead and to see how going that direction helped us grow or learn something.  I am praying that our youth will step up a notch in there walks with God. I mean I understand that the teenage years are years with a lot of different changes, pressures, etc. But what an opportunity to really grow in a deep relationship with Jesus now. The youth are the ones who are going to reach different generations, how cool is that? I just pray that God will use me to help them, even more so. I love our kids so much, they mean the world to me. Maybe I should let them know that more, maybe I can tell them that when they step up and pray that I almost want to cry because it's so neat to see.  I think it is good to let them know that they are special in their unique ways, whether it is being on the worship team, or helping out with the kids for mops, being the janitor, or someone who reaches out to the new kids, they are all awesome when they use there gifts! I guess we as the "leaders" need to step up and find ways to let the kids know that we are so proud of them for just showing up to youth. Thanks Lord for the kids you have given us. Thank you that you are bringing in the ones you have into our lives. I pray that you will be with each and every one of them, tend to all their needs. Let them know that you love them so much and you will do anything to have a love relationship with them. Use us leaders to do your will, not ours but yours. Help us build a nation of prayer warriors, worshippers, and lovers of you.  I have to write my favorite worship song every time I hear or sing it I just want to cry, we are so unworthy, so undeserving, but God still loves us. It's Faithful Father: Father, I can't explain this kind of love This kind of grace I know I still break your heart and yet you run to welcome me  This is my song of praise to you For who you are and all that you do From the moment my life began You have been faithful  Father, I love the way you hold me close and say my name I know when my life is through my heart will find it's home in you This is my song of praise to you For who you are and all that you do From the moment my life began You have been faithful  You will be faithful, forever faithful, my Father

      Mom and I just came back from Park Regency, I've been putting it off going there (the nursing home) not for good reasons mind you, just because I am scared. Well my Ruthy isn't there anymore, that's exactly what I was afraid of. She pasted away a couple of months ago, I guess it's a good thing because she wanted to go. She said that what's the point of living when you are ninety-one and you've already lived a full life? I loved her so much, I loved sitting and listening to her tell me stories of how she was a pastor's daughter, and how her momma was a singer. She would sometime forget what she told me in the middle of a sentence and tell the story all over again but it didn't matter.  She was a stinker, she wouldn't let anyone in to talk to her besides me and a few others. She never went to the activities we had going on, so sometimes I would sing to her songs that we sang at the sing-a-long, she would always ask how old I was because I shouldn't know those songs because I am too young. She loved to read and spell, I took her to a spelling contest that the other residents where doing but it was no competition because she knew every word, and I even looked a hard one up in the dictionary! My favorite thing about her was she had one tooth, she said that as long as she has that one she doesn't need to get dentures. She also said that her dad told her that if you rub gin on your gums you'd get a whole third set of teeth, so she was waiting for her third set to get in.  Her favorite thing to eat was green olives, chocolate, and cheese so of course I would spoil her when she was running low. She also told me that she wished her father could have met me cuz he would like me a lot, I loved to look in her eyes when she said that because you could see how much she loved me then. I could sit and hold her hand forever. I could of had one more chance if I went sooner to see her. She will always hold a special place in my heart, she will be my Ruthy. I was there to bless her but in the end she was the one who made my life better, she was the one who no matter what kind of day it was could make me feel so special and loved. I'll miss you Ruthy, thanks for all the good memories. I love you.

      It was mom's birthday today and every minute she was home she reminded us of it. It's kind of cute because it is her special day, she didn't know what time she was born so daddy got her birth certificate and found out she was born at 3 am. My grandma doesn't even remember that! We took mom out to Islands for dinner it was fun. Then we got home and had some left over cake from the surprise birthday party we gave her on Saturday and of course sang to her. Another year younger she likes it when we say that! :)  I went to my interning class today seems like forever since I have been there, they did an activity were they had to write on paper a question like: who is your favorite singer? And each one had to go around and write their answers on each other's papers if that makes sense, then graph the results. One of the guys said who is your favorite wrestler but nobody knew wrestler because they don't watch wrestling. I watched WWF or whatever it's called with Jojo all the time when I went to Grand Canyon. We would hang out in the dorm and watch Goldberg he was our favorite wrestler. Jojo's brother Kofe was married to Jerry Kalangilo's (I don't know how to spell his last name) daughter so once we got to go to WWF and we had a blast it was so much fun! Anyways, I was telling the boy who asked that question that I like Goldberg and he was like "does he even wrestle anymore?" I was like, "I don't know!" I was trying to be with it and know what I am talking about just to get shot down, I almost was cool for a little bit. hee hee. I keep seeing puppies everywhere it's just not fair. Everybody knows I want a mastiff puppy why does it get rubbed in my face by the whole world? Well  not the whole world, but I've been seeing lots of puppies everywhere, then dad or mom comes home and tells me a story about a puppy. I think it's intentional they want to see how many buttons to push before I go crazy. But if I did it wouldn't matter I still wouldn't get my Samson. Again I have to be patience, (sigh).

      My friend Jen is in town from California! It was so good to see her and talk to her, it's a little different now that she is married but not that much. We can leave off just where we did last time. She's great, I just wish she would move here closer to us so that we can all share life together. Chad thinks it's too hot here though. Oh well, at least we are closer than Israel now.

      It's hard to believe that my baby brother is graduated, he's no longer in high school. Geez, how come time flies by so fast? I remember when he was just a little guy who would steal my fisher price records and dance in his diapers to the music. I remember a little guy who was such a prayer warrior that in church the pastor would ask him to pray (he was 8) and he would cry for the whole church while he was praying it was so cool. Now he is a man and we couldn't be prouder. He has a heart for worship, he loves the Lord, he can sing and play the piano, and he has a heart for kids his age. I love it. Not because those are things that I am in to but because each of these aspects I mentioned makes the man of God that Gabe is. I love that he loves God and I love that he reaches out and shows his love to others. Watch out you college girls cuz here comes Gabe! Can't get him without getting through me first though, ha ha ha!

      We had a great night with the college group last night, after group some of us went to Canyon Lake to go swimming. Well it was chilly out so I already knew that I probally wasn't going to get in. I didn't prepare for the fact that I would get motion sickness on the way. I don't know what happened, I'm usually not one to get sick but I did. Mandy and Amy were in the back of John's truck screaming like crazy girls and the first time we stopped a cop came up after we had parked and asked, "Why are we screaming people?" How old are you all? We are all over 21 (we forgot that Steve was only 20), but then Mandy raises her hand and tells the cop, "I was the one screaming, I am a 29 year old mom and I don't get out much!" Amy did the same thing, it was funny. I was glad he didn't ask if we were drinking or anything because I had just got done throwing up in the bush. I'm sorry that's gross, huh? But it was fun watching Mandy, Susie, Amy, Jen, and Obie pretend not to be cold while they were swimming. John and Steve started throwing rocks at them, we were way too loud for the people who were trying to fish. Oh well we had fun. Then we went to Denny's and the guy who was there was the guy who was our waiter on Thursday morning when we took the seniors out to lunch and he remembered all of our drinks and orders exactly. Well not exactly because he thought I was Angela, but I don't mind because she's beautiful. I didn't get home till 2 and then mom was up and she was talking to us till 3. Craziness. She had a lot of energy for that hour she amazes me.

      This morning at 4:00 am we went to get all the senior's out of bed to come to breakfast with us, the catch was though that they couldn't get ready. Hannah, Obie and I had Jordan, Jake, and Erica to get up to bring to Denny's. We went to wake up Erica and she was like, why are you doing this? CUZ WE LOVE YOU, GET UP! After that she was like ok. Jordan was already awake since Obie called the house because they didn't answer after fifteen minutes so all Obie had to do was bring him. Jake's dog went crazy as soon as we knocked on the door Janet came to the door but I think she was still in her pj's because she was hiding behind the door. We woke up Jake he was like it's morning already I just went to sleep! Good Morning Jake now GET UP! John woke up and said what's happening guys? Whatcha doing? And it kind of seemed like he wanted to say I want to play! He asked if he could come to, it's just so crazy because he seemed wide awake. It was so much fun getting to bless the youth, when we were all at Denny's I got to see all the pictures that each leader took of the getting up part it was great. Mandy made some awesome graduation hats so the youth had to wear them in Denny's, Gabe and Jake kept putting their hats on my head. I am glad too that Angela and Robert, Maria, and Karri got to come as well. As much as I love this kids and as much as I love doing things like this I just have to say that 4 am is just to early! Even the early bird doesn't get up at that time cuz it's still sleeping. Luckily though I got to sleep as soon as I got home which was like 8:30. I woke up at 12:30 so I feel rested. So much Fun! So much Fun!

      I asked God to take away my bad habit.  God said, No.  It is not for me to take away, but for you to give it up.   I asked God to make my handicapped child whole.  God said, No.  His spirit is whole, his body is only temporary.   I asked God to grant me patience.  God said, No.  Patience is a byproduct of tribulations;  it isn't granted, it is learned.   I asked God to give me happiness.  God said, No.  I give you blessings; Happiness is up to you.   I asked God to spare me pain.  God said, No.  Suffering draws you apart from worldly cares  and brings you closer to me.   I asked God to make my spirit grow.  God said, No.  You must grow on your own! ,  but I will prune you to make you fruitful.   I asked God for all things that I might enjoy life.  God said, No. I will give you life, so that you may enjoy all things.   I asked God to help me LOVE others, as much as He loves me.  God said...Ahhhh, finally you have the idea.     "Good friends are like stars...You don't always see them,  but you know they are always there."

      Sometimes going to the dentist can be so nerve raking, like did I floss enough or did I brush enough that they can tell? It's just funny that it is a normal procedure for the doctor and person who actually cleans your teeth but for the person getting a cleaning it's a little scary cuz you are waiting to hear you didn't floss enough or you have gingivitus. My problem is that every time I floss my gums bleed like crazy and I have the reddest gums imaginable. My dentist says it's because I am on lots of medication because of my arthritis. But it was all good even though I lost a lot of blood my teeth are in great condition. Only thing I need is to get an electric toothbrush.  I went to my grandma's with Andre after our cleanings to have lunch and see my grandma's new puppy. They named her Chula, and she is the tiniest dog I have ever seen. She is a polmeranian so she looks like a little fur ball. All she does is sleep and pee it seems like, oh and bite your toes. I was trying to take a picture of her sleeping but she got up and I was on the ground, I didn't get up fast enough because she was doing her business on the tile. My grandma was like "Cela you know she goes outside as soon as she gets up!" I was like "I'm sorry I can't get up off the ground fast I am made of metal." hee hee. My grandma's lunch was awesome today we had spaghetti, tuna casserole, salad, and Hawaiian chicken. After we ate all that Grandma brought out the icecream with strawberries, she and Andre had watermelon. What a feast! She told me after we eat that we were going to go to Osco to look for electric toothbrushes because she used to work there and she could get a discount for me. We found one but I couldn't believe how expensive they were almost a hundred dollars! We got ours for 60 with her discount, it's nice to have people who know people.

      I got thrown in the pool tonight for the first time! I know I know it's against the rules to throw Cela in but it happened thanks to Jonathan and Abraham. 6 times between the two of them I went in clothes and everything. The funny thing is I brought a swimsuit but I never got to put it on. Ben didn't even save me, I was horrified. :) Luckily though Jonathan and Abraham didn't just throw me in like any other person I was gently thrown in. Nice of them, huh? After the fifth time I was like, "Stop picking of the easiest person to throw in!" I think I actually kicked someone in the face. It was weird because although I don't like getting thrown in it made me feel like one of them in a way, like I am not left out anymore. So that was cool and I got a chance to talk to Gracie and her friend coming in and out of the pool. Bonding time with the youth, how awesome is that?! And afterwards when the dj was playing his music I got some of the kids to do the cha cha slide with me, and the other great dances that I love. Gracie, Abraham, and one of their friends all ran up to the front when the Macarena came on and were like, "come on Cela let's go!" hee hee. I feel so loved. So there is my story funny but it has an awesome ending.

      Today I had lunch with my grandma and grandpa, my grandma's sister, my dad, and my Tia. My grandparent's favorite place to eat is Souper Salad so we went there. Just to be silly I called my grandma on Tuesday to "confirm our lunch date," she couldn't stop talking about that during lunch she thinks I am so crazy. My grandma's sister likes to say, "oh my Maricela, oh my Maricela," as she hugs or kisses me. They like me a lot for some reason. Probally because there aren't to many young adults who like hanging out with grandparents. I do cuz I learn a lot about my mom that way and also my dad because I hear lots of stories. My grandma's getting a puppy next weekend I am excited because one of my favorite smells is puppy breath, my dad loves it too I know we are weird.  I saw Sammy today he was mad because he hates to do ABC order for his spelling words, but he is just the cutest guy in the world when he gets upset. I just wanted to kiss him he was so adorable but we had to work past the anger and when he finally got the hang of it he started liking spelling more. I was proud of Vanessa tonight at youth, it was her first time singing and she did a great job.  It was good to see Joel tonight, he surprised me because I thought he wasn't coming for awhile. It's going to be just like old times hanging out with Joel once he moves here. Fun! I remember when we had Joel, Paul,and a guy named Joe living with us for a little bit. Joel and Paul played the guitar so they would have late night music sessions, once they went and made up songs about each person there. So they made a song up about me, it was funny. We also would watch Jean Claude Van Damme movies, Joel could do the stunt where there are two chairs and you did the splits on the chairs like Jean Claude did in one of his movies, some type of balancing thing. I gotta to say that I like staying after youth and just talking to people, it is so much fun.

      This blogger thing is a lot different now I sure hope I know what I am doing. Well today I didn't get up till one, isn't that sad?! I didn't know that I was even that tired! It's funny eating breakfast at one, lunch at 4 and dinner at 7 what a good eating schedule. School is done hooray! I am off for three weeks! It's amazing how rest is really so important and how sometimes we forget to do it. I want to just go and party all day but most of my friends work. This isn't high school anymore, even in high school I would wait till Sharon got off work to do stuff.

      Today was my last day in my interning placement, I am kind of bummed that I won't be able to see these kids anymore but I think I will be alright. I love the kids but fifth grade is not my grade. When I left the kindergartners last semester they all came around me telling me that they loved me and will miss me, in fifth grade you are too cool for that so I got a bunch of hand shakes, an occasional hug, and a bunch of see yas. Bye Ms. M. I got to take pictures with them and apparently they have something for me but it wasn't finished today so they are mailing it to me, I wonder what it could be.  I went to see my Sam today, he was so stinking adorable today I don't know what happened but he was so different. So we did some homework his motivation was a bag of skittles for three homework pages, he did them so fast that I didn't even have to help him that much. He was reading over his homework page and if he misread a word I would tell him the correct way to say it, he patted me on the head and said, "Thanks for the reminder Ms. Cela!" He's so funny. Then he decided that he wanted to read out of the Bible we read 1 Samuel the part about Hannah's Prayer, after we read it he was so happy that we read the Bible that he asked for a kiss. I thought a kiss on the cheek but nope right on the lips. Then as I was about to leave he said, "Ms. Cela we need to pray," well he never does any of this stuff normally so I was shocked! I said "What do you want to pray about Sam?" "Anything," he said. "But you go first." So I prayed for him and his family. Then he prays and heres how it went: "Lord please help me remember you in everything I do." Ok so I am crying by then because that was the most beautiful prayer I have ever heard a kid pray and on top of that Sam who we have been trying to help learn about God is the one who said this prayer. It just goes to show you that kids understand a lot more than they show sometimes and their faith is a lot bigger than ours. I was so excited for Sam, his parent's were shocked like me. I was just thanking God all the way to youth.

      I know I went blog wild today but I can't help it, I found so many poems that I really liked about moms. Mom is the person that I hope I can be like when I get older. She is an amazing woman of God and she has such a heart to minister to people. Her kids in her class love her so much, I hope I can be that kind of teacher. I hope that someday I will be blessed like my mother was in finding the perfect man. Mom shows me what a woman of God and nobility acts and speaks like, through good times and bad. Thanks Mom for showing me how to be a better woman, I love you.

When you were 22, she hugged you at your college graduation.   You thanked her by asking whether she could pay for a trip to Europe.   When you were 23, she gave you furniture for your first apartment.   You thanked her by telling your friends it was ugly.   When you were 24, she met your fiance and asked about your plans for the future.   You thanked her by glaring and growling, "Muuhh-ther, please!"   When you were 25, she helped to pay for your wedding, and she cried and told   you how deeply she loved you.   You thanked her by moving halfway across the country.   When you were 30, she called with some advice on the baby.   You thanked her by telling her, "Things are different now."   When you were 40, she called to remind you of an relative's birthday.   You thanked her by saying you were "really busy right now."   When you were 50, she fell ill and needed you to take care of her.   You thanked her by reading about the burden parents become to their children.     And then, one day, she quietly died. And everything you never did came   crashing down like thunder.    "Rock me baby, rock me all night long."   "The hand who rocks the cradle...may rock the world".   Let us take a moment of the time just to pay tribute/show appreciation to   the person called MOM though some may not say it openly to their mother.   There's no substitute for her. Cherished every single moment.   Though at times she may not be the best of friends, may not agree to our   thoughts, she is still your mother!!!   She will be there for you...to listen to your woes, your braggings, your   frustations, etc.   Ask yourself.....have you put aside enough time for her, to listen to her   "blues" of working in the kitchen, her tiredness???   Be tactful, loving and still show her due respect though you may have a   different view from hers.   Once gone, only fond memories of the past and also regrets will be left.    **DON'T TAKE FOR GRANTED THE THINGS CLOSEST TO YOUR HEART. CLING TO THEM AS   U WOULD YOUR LIFE, FOR WITHOUT THEM, LIFE IS MEANINGLESS*

      THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN  The beauty of a woman Is not in the clothes she wears, The figure that she carries, Or the way she combs her hair.  The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, Because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.  The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole, But true beauty in a woman Is reflected in her soul.  It is the caring that she lovingly gives, The passion that she shows, And the beauty of a woman With passing years-only grows!  You don't stop laughing because you grow old; you grow old because you stop laughing

      Why are you crying, a young boy asked his Mom?   "Because I'm a woman," she told him.   "I don't understand," he said.   His Mom just hugged him and said,  "And you never will, but that's O.K.".......   Later the little boy asked his father,  "Why does Mom seem to cry for no reason?".  "All women cry for no reason," was all his Dad could say......   The little boy grew up and became a man,  still wondering why women cry.   Finally he put in a call to God and when God got back to him, he asked "God, why do women cry so easily?"   GOD answered......   "When I made woman,  I decided she had to be special.  I made her shoulders  strong enough to carry  the weight of the world, yet,  made her arms gentle enough to give comfort...   I gave her the inner strength  to endure childbirth  and the rejection  that many times will come  even from her own children.   I gave her a hardness  that allows her  to keep going and take care  of her family and friends,  even when everyone else gives up, through sickness and fatigue without  complaining....   I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all  circumstances. Even when her child has hurt her badly....   She has the very special power to make a child's boo-boo feel better and  to quell a teenager's anxieties and fears....   I gave her strength to care for her husband, despite faults  and I fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart....   I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but  sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him  unfalteringly....   For all of this hard work,  I also gave her a tear to shed.  It is hers to use  whenever needed and !  it is her only weakness....  When you see her cry,  tell her how much you love her, and all she does for everyone, and even though  she may still cry, you will have made her heart feel good.

      MOTHER.  From seeds You watered us.  As we sprouted You helped us grow With the warmth Of your radiant love.  Along the way You trimmed us To keep us safe From Harm.  When we grew out of Our little pods, You replanted us, Where you gave us hope And showed us faith That we may be able To do for others As you did for us.

      A MOTHER'S LOVE  A Mother's love is something that no on can explain, It is made of deep devotion and of sacrifice and pain, It is endless and unselfish and enduring come what may For nothing can destroy it or take that love away . . . It is patient and forgiving when all others are forsaking, And it never fails or falters even though the heart is breaking . . . It believes beyond believing when the world around condemns, And it glows with all the beauty of the rarest, brightest gems . . . It is far beyond defining, it defies all explanation, And it still remains a secret like the mysteries of creation . . . A many splendoured miracle man cannot understand And another wondrous evidence of God's tender guiding hand.

      MOTHER...  Mother You filled my days with rainbow lights, fairytales and sweet dream nights, A kiss to wipe away my tears, Gingerbread to ease my fears. You gave the gift of life to me, And then in love, you set me free. I thank you for your tender care, for deep warm hugs and being there. I hope that when you think of me, A part of you, you'll always see.

      A WONDERFUL MOTHER.  GOD made a wonderful mother, A mother who never grows old; He made her smile of the sunshine, And He molded her heart of pure gold; In her eyes He placed bright shining stars, In her cheeks, fair roses you see; God made a wonderful mother, And He gave that dear mother to me.

      MOTHER'S ARE THE SWEETEST.  Our mother is the sweetest and Most delicate of all. She knows more of paradise Than angels can recall.  She's not only beautiful But passionately young, Playful as a kid, yet wise As one who has lived long.  Her love is like the rush of life, A bubbling, laughing spring That runs through all like liquid light And makes the mountains sing.  And makes the meadows turn to flower And trees to choicest fruit. She is at once the field and bower In which our hearts take root.  She is at once the sea and shore, Our freedom and our past. With her we launch our daring ships Yet keep the things that last.

      I saw the cutest thing in the world today on my way to school. I saw a mother duck with her babies crossing the street. I don't know how they knew that they had the walk sign but they did, and then the daddy was following them. All the little babies were waddling and hopped onto the sidewalk from the street. It was so precious.

      I am amazed that I go to church and sometimes don't get to see the people who are in our college group, I mean they go to the same church and everything but it seems like it is a hit or miss sometimes. I got to hang out with most of the college and career today I realized how much I miss getting together to fellowship. I am really excited about college group starting up again. I am also excited about our girl's group, I am also scared because am I worthy enough to be teaching a whole group of women? I know Hannah will have my back but it's like who am I? Just Cela! I pray that it won't be about my teaching or guidance but about what God wants to do, building prayer warriors in the woman. I also pray that relationships will be built and that we can support and encourage each other throughout the week.

      Here is a funny story that I heard today:  A little girl: was talking to her teacher about whales.  The teacher: said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human because even though it was a very large mammal its throat was very small.  The little girl: stated that Jonah was swallowed by a whale.  Irritated, the teacher: reiterated that a whale could not swallow a human; it was physically impossible.  The little girl: said, "When I get to heaven I will ask Jonah".  The teacher: asked, " What if Jonah went to hell?"  The little girl: replied, "Then you ask him".

      Yesterday when I was with the boys I started feeling nauseated and I had to lie down for a bit. I didn't feel like eating because I didn't want to throw up. I hate throwing up. Anyways, I took a nap then called mom she came over and helped me eat but said I had lost color in my face. Well I was dizzy and feeling cold sweats too, I'm like what is this all about? After mom left I took Derek to basketball, I was feeling a little better but then it came back the sweats, my stomach was all twisted, well I didn't keep my lunch in to long, I fell asleep on the couch. Luckily the boys were great and they helped me out a little by putting in a movie, reading, and doing crafts. I felt bad because I wasn't giving my attention to them but I also just felt bad. So God is good because I was worried about picking up Derek from basketball, Anne (their mom) came home early and she told me to go home and rest.  Mom was a great nurse last night, she helped make me feel better. So when my dad called he told me that I am going through a withdraw from my medication. I told him today that I am so glad that I never did an illegal drug and was addicted to it because getting off of it is terrible!!!

      The doctor's report is in......... it's not the arthritis! The eye doctor says that I have really bad allergies! Woo hoo hooray for allergies!!! I always get to be the guinea pig for people who are learning how to become doctors, like when I go see my arthritis doctor he always has an intern there and they have to make a diagnosis of how they think I am doing and then my doctor will ask a question about my situation and they have to answer it like a quiz. Today in at my eye appointment there were three people looking at me, the real doctor and two other people I didn't even get introduced to. The main doctor looked at my eye then left asking the other person to look and make a diagnosis, then the second person asked the third person if he wanted to look at my eyes and he was like of course! I was very weird cuz all three of them came up with what to do with me. I was just so relieved that it didn't have anything to do with my arthritis that when he was telling me instructions for medicine I almost started to cry I could hear in my voice that I was choked up the lady just looked at me funny, hee hee. God is just so good to me, I was so nervous today but I knew that no matter what God's got my back he will still be there to hold me up, he will always be right by my side. He's just so awesome.

      Three days without my depression medicine so far so good. I mean I think I cry more now than I did when I was on the medicine, it doesn't seem right. Praise God though because I am sleeping, something that I was worried about. I even get some naps during the day, well not lately because the boys are in VBS and Camp this week. I thank all of you who are praying for me, it helps to know that I have the support.  I was kind of embarrassed because in the prayer email that was written to the whole church it says that I have rheumatiod arthritis in my eyes, it just sounds funny. It is affecting my eyes but I don't think that eyes have joints. So for that I go see a doctor tomorrow. When I called to get an appointment the lady I was talking to asked what the deal was I told her I have arthritis, I don't know if she didn't believe me or what because she was like "how old are you?" I'm 24. Oh, and then she went on asking questions. I guess that I don't sound old enough to have arthritis. Don't look it or sound it, great for me!! Tonight we had a waterballon/water gun fight with the youth at Freestone Park, well everyone else did I ran away. It was kind of windy and cold, I didn't want to get wet. Angela, Amy, and I were watching an obedience school for German shepherds being held and we were far away on a hill from the water, we were safe so I thought. I could see Robert and Steve coming with a bucket, Angela and I started getting up to get away. I thought they were going after Angela we were both screaming I think, they went after me! I was like don't make me run, don't get me wet!! Those boys brought an empty bucket, they are so mean!  Another cute thing was that there were a couple of people who were like Cela isn't wet yet, Andy and Zach were like you leave her alone don't get her tonight. They were watching out for me, isn't that awesome?!

      I am trying a scary thing for me, I am trying to completely be off my anti-depressant drug. The last month or so I have been feeling foggy and having headaches feeling weird so when I was house sitting I brought enough medicine for seven days but I was there nine. The last two days I didn't use my medication and guess what? My head isn't foggy and I don't have headaches, the best thing was that I slept all night without my drugs! So I asked my dad what I should do because if it's wrong to go cold turkey I don't want to do something that's stupid. I've been on Remeron for ever it seems like, two to three years I think. I asked my psychiatrist once if I could gradually wean myself off and she got upset saying that I have had three major depression episodes and that it would be likely to have another. She was like if you want to get off of them just do it, don't wean yourself off. I was thinking don't get an attitude I just want to know what my options are! I am scared because I know how to handle my emotions properly now but I hope that I can, and I am scared that I will go through a withdrawal. So my dad says to see how it goes for the next week and go from there.  Lord I pray that you will be the owner of my emotions, I pray that you will be my strength, help me through my fears. I am so excited and nervous because I have wanted for a long time to get off this drug. I pray that you will take hold of the depression and make it not be an issue anymore. I believe that with your help we can get through this together so please take my hand and guide me. Thanks.

      At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning-disabled children, the father of one of the school's students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended.   After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question.  "Everything God does is done with perfection. Yet, my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do. Where is God's plan reflected in my son?"   The audience was stilled by the query. The father continued. "I believe," the father answered, "that when God brings a child like Shay into the world, an opportunity to realize the Divine Plan presents itself. And it comes in the way people treat that child."  Then, he told the following story: Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, "Do you think they will let me play?" Shay's father knew that most boys would not want him on their team. But the father understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging.  Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance from his teammates. Getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said, "We are losing by six runs, and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning." In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three.  At the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield. Although no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands.  In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base. Shay was scheduled to be the next at-bat. Would the team actually let Shay bat at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game?  Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball. However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed..  The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball to the pitcher. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have ended the game.  Instead, the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high arc to right field, far beyond reach of the first baseman. Everyone started yelling, "Shay, run to first. Run to first." Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled. Everyone yelled "Run to second, run to second!" By the time Shay was rounding first base, the right fielder had the ball. He could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag. But the right fielder understood what the pitcher's intentions had been, so he threw the ball high and far over the third baseman's head. Shay ran toward second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases toward home.  As Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned him in the direction of third base, and shouted, "Run to third!" As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams were screaming, "Shay! Run home!"  Shay ran home, stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero, for hitting a "grand slam" and winning the game for his team.  "That day," said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, "the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this world."

      I was hanging out with my cousin this week it was fun, she absolutely adores me it's crazy. So it meant the world to her that we were doing something together. I am kind of sad because she has a lot of problems like she has a bad arm she had a couple of surgeries on her foot but no one knows what is the cause her family keeps it hush hush. She used to cut herself too but she is on prozac so she doesn't do that anymore. So she loves to play Scrabble but when she plays me she always wants me to win so she does everything in her power to make sure I win, like if she knows that the word will get her a big score she will put down a two letter word just so I can be happy when I win. Well I am not going to be happy because I don't like it when people don't play for reals and I don't have to win all the time to be happy, it is nice of her though to think that way she has such a good heart. I invited her to college group since she is 23, but she can't get a ride she doesn't have her license yet because she's scared to drive. She was asking me all these questions about the music I listen to and what our college group does, so soon she will be getting her permit then her license so maybe she can come and hang out. What was interesting to me was that she had just had a foot surgery like a month ago and she still had her stitches it felt like degavoo for me because I had just been there, like I was seeing what it is like on the other end of the stick. I was the one to help walk and what not, I was the one who had to be sure not to walk too fast because I was going to wear her out. I just want to say for those who put up with me during those times thanks. If you can please pray for my cousin she is so awesome and I love her so much but she needs to find God's love too.

      Welcome to Cela's world I am glad that you can stop by and visit. Right now I am dog sitting for Rebel and I guess Hamster sitting. I get to stay at the house for a week and it kind of feels like it is my own. Gets me thinking about when the time will come for me to really move out and what that will be like. Mom calls almost every hour now so when I am on my one does that mean she will call more? I know they just miss me and want to see how I'm doing. It's all good I don't mind as much now as I did when I was a teenager. That sounds funny, like I'm ancient or something. BABUSHCA! hee hee. Trevor said to me the other day, Cela your 24 so how come your not married? He hasn't found me yet. I thought it was a good answer.  So I bought a dance video that has all the Latin Dances that I've always wanted to learn on it. Rhumba, Cha-Cha, Argentina Tango, Merengue, and some other ones that I don't remember right now. I am so excited though because the dances aren't as hard as I thought they would be. The only bad part is that I don't have a partner so it looks kind of funny dancing a couple dance by myself. But it is so much fun and I love every minute of it. When we went cosmic bowling with the youth on Friday the music there was getting everyone in a dancing mood even Hannah! Yep she was getting her groove on. It was fun watching Z-Diddy, Andrew, John and Steve dance. It was a great time of course I couldn't help moving my feet you get carried away when there is music! I could of danced all night, I could of danced all night, and still have danced some more......

      I just got done watching  Shrek 2  with Gabe, it's funny. I think he has seen it three times now but he still wanted to see it with me. That was really neat of him to want to hang out with his big sister tonight, I haven't had a chance lately to be that to him.  My brothers and my dad ended up watching  Dance With Me   last night, yes I watched it again, they loved it too. I was thinking though that I wonder if it could be possible to be able to dance with arthritis, I mean I wonder if my joints would get too worn out. I love to dance and I would give anything to just go and dance without the worry of not being able to walk in the morning. Daddy says that some people can believe or want something so much that they can make it happen. I want to believe, I want to dance, I want to run, jump and play. That's not impossible is it? It's not just a dream, God is way bigger than I. I know it.

      Ok so tonight I rented,  Dance with Me  and just let me tell you that I want to learn how to do all those Latin dances they were amazing! I get so excited when I see stuff like that it makes me want to go and dance. I kind of know how to dance but I would love to learn the proper way instead of my own made up way if you know what I mean. I think I am going to do all that I can to get into shape then I will go and find a place to learn dancing. First though I have to do a lot of Taebo and maybe some of Darren's Dance Grooves, yes I bought that. I thought it would teach me more hip hop dancing but they only show you like one dance and it's not even a whole song. I wish my Sharon were here because this would be something that we could do together. I know her and Wes have tried dancing before and that's awesome. Well I am off to go dance the night away, bye!

      Being a Christian  When I say..... "I am a Christian"  I'm not shouting "I'm clean livin" I'm whispering "I was lost" Now I'm found and I'm forgiven.  When I say... "I am a Christian" I don't speak of this with pride. I'm confessing that I stumble and need CHRIST to be my guide.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not trying to be strong. I'm professing that I'm weak and need HIS strength to carry on.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not bragging of success. I'm admitting I have failed and need God to clean my mess.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not claiming to be perfect, My flaws are far too visible but, God believes I am worth it.  When I say... "I am a Christian" I still feel the sting of pain, I have my share of heartaches So I call upon His name.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not holier than thou, I'm just a simple sinner who received God's good grace, somehow.

      I have a new respect for those people who work a 8-5 job, I started working this week and I have to be in by 7:30ish, it's so hard for me! Like I am still getting six to eight hours of sleep but I am used to 10-12. I am pathetic I know but my body isn't used to the lack of sleep. Luckily though before the boys wake up I get about an hour nap, it's funny because their parent's leave for work and I just go sit on the couch with the dog and we take a nap till the boys wake up. It helps.   Derek and Trevor are some pretty neat boys, we play lots of games let me tell you. I didn't think that Scrabble would be a popular game with boys who are 10 and 12 but we've played it a lot lately. We decided to make homemade pudding yesterday it looked disgusting but it tasted great. The boys also learned how to make a sandwich, I couldn't believe that they didn't know how. Their dad was so proud when they told him later.   I guess if you can please pray that I get the rest I need even if it means making myself go to bed earlier and that I will have enough energy to keep up with the boys. Thanks!

      I can't believe that Ireland is only four days away, it seems like we have been waiting forever to get to this place. I don't know what to expect but I know that with God it will be good. I just pray that he will be able to use all of us for his glory. The greatest thing ever is that we have so many people who love us enough to pray and lift us up while we are there. That is awesome. I'm going to miss my family, they said they are going to replace me when I am gone, hee hee with a dog! I am all for that, how cool would it be to come home to a little puppy? I'm not complaining one bit!  I have gotten to know new Amy a lot better during the last month it has been awesome. She is so happy that she has someone to call whenever she wants to talk. She keeps saying that three weeks is a long time, I can't believe you will be gone for three weeks! I told her that if she really wants to she can leave phone messages on my cell phone so when I get back I can check them, she just thought I was funny. Oh well. It is nice to know you will be missed.  I am so happy that before we leave we get to have karaoke night and I won't have to miss it. That is the one thing I look forward to, it's funny because I was bummed last time that we ended so early I  told Mike how I felt and he was like I'm old you do it next time! I was like ok! But no, it was just a suggestion. So I think it is going to be a little later I'm not sure how much though. Not many people get as excited as I do about karaoke night, it's ok though because Andre and Gabe like to sing with me. I think it's the greatest time in the world.

      If you ever want to have a relaxing day I would definitely recommend going tubing down the Salt Lake River, it is the best experience ever! Like you don't have to do anything but work on your tan or burn in my case. Parts of it are slow and then some parts are fast rapids that make it more fun and exciting because you feel like you are doing something adventurous. The best part is if you go with a group of friends you can all sit and hang out together. I don't know why I haven't done that before I was telling my friend Amy, like the canyons are just amazingly beautiful. I love God for making his creation so enjoyable. Thanks God for making my day!!

      I've been taking care of the dog that the people I nanny for have and I couldn't remember when I was supposed to take him home. Usually I stay over there at the house but I was already away from my family too long so Rebel came home with me for a couple of days. Anyways, it was kind of funny because yesterday I get a call from the dad asking where their dog is. I forgot they were coming home! I felt so silly! I was told later that the boys were very nervous because they thought their dog got dognapped or something like that. The were running around the house calling Rebel's name! Their mom was like why would a dognapper take all Rebel's toys, food, and stuff if he was in a hurry? I was like, I'm sorry I have the dog!   I just wanted to see my family! I missed them!  Anyways, I was glad to get to see the boys again we had lots of fun playing Xbox today. I am really missing my Team from Ireland, luckily thanks to email and MSN I talk to most them everyday. It's weird to think that we were just together last week. I love being home but a part of me is expecting my team to walk in and come to hang out with me. Now we have memories and pictures to help us remeniesce. Why is it so lonely being home? That's the oddest thing to me! I look forward to every email or chat time that I have with my teammates. Funny thing is Missy lives here and I miss her too. I'm a sad little lady I know. Being on the subject of friends reminds me of a poem my sister Sharon gave to me awhile ago by Emily Matthews:  You're a FRIEND Who's Meant to Be  Sometimes when two people meet, they simply seem to know That, in their hearts, a deep and lasting friendship soon will grow.... They're truly kindred spirits, feeling free to give and share The gifts of joy and laughter, of warmth and gentle care. And when you've found a friend like that, you soon will come to see How fortunate you are to have a friend who's "meant to be!"  We share a special friendship and I know we always will. For the caring bond between our hearts keeps growing deeper still. Your warmth and understanding all you are and all you do. Remind me what a joy it is to have a friend like you.

      I hate it when you get up super early and can't get back to bed, it happened to me this morning. I didn't go to bed till 1 and I got up at 6! ARGH! No fair! I went to see what's going on with my registration today for school, my counselor yelled at me because she thought that I had only taken one science and she had told me a couple of times that I needed to get two sciences done before third semester, because I failed sciences my freshman year. It was just a really bad year, I still have to pay for it weird how that works. I was confused because I knew I took them. Luckily after I called her on it I was right, I just don't like getting yelled at. Daddy took me to lunch today, I look forward to Dad times during the week because we can talk about everything. I think it is so important if you are a parent to spend time with your kids individually, my dad does a good job at this. I got to eat Mexican food which I had been craving for a couple of weeks in Ireland. In youth group tonight I was given the opportunity to pray with a girl who was having some problems, I thought it was the greatest thing that she was comfortable enough with me to share her struggles, God is so cool in how he asks us to do his work. Like I loved being in a different country but God is using us in our own country as well! That's so cool! Right on! I was also blessed by some of the youth coming up to me and telling me that they missed seeing me around. How awesome is that?! Oh the cutest thing in the world was when I saw my brother Gabe when I got home from Ireland and he told me that he had learned a new song on the piano. It was one of my favorites and he learned it!! It was Only Hope from A Walk to Remember. So cute my brothers are. I really did miss them a lot. Lord, thank you for a fantastic day. Thank you for kisses from the king, the little blessings you give to us each and every day. Thank you for family, friends, and most importantly your love. I love you so much!!!

      I can't believe how fast three weeks goes, I loved being in Ireland. It's gorgeous there. It's so hard for me to fathom that people don't believe in God when it is more than evident in his creation in nature. I loved seeing green everything quite a constrast from our desert life here in Arizona. I was so blessed to have some amazing team members who served in the same town in Portadown with me. Emma and Colin were perfect for the leader job, they challenged us to make this trip more than just serving the children but also to work on our spiritual walks and the importance of unity in our team. I really enjoyed getting to know some people from Ireland besides our leaders: Laura is a sweet woman who is very wise for her age I loved chatting with her, Elaine who is a sweet loving gentle spirit who is a joy to be around, Alex who is like my Irish little brother who if I could I would take him home with me cuz he is so much fun. Then I was blessed to get to know people from America as well: Lyndsey who can make anybody laugh no matter what the situation is, Joy who is fun to hangout I love her humor, Alyssa who is so talented with kids and is good at making friends with all kinds of people, Max who is quiet but wise beyond his youth, and Johnathan who is fun to talk to because we have gone through a lot of the same stuff. I love my team and I know it wasn't by chance that we came together it was totally a God thing. Lord, I thank you for the relationships that have developed throughout these past three weeks. I thank you for bringing Emma, Colin, Laura, Elaine, Alex, Lyndsey, Joy, Alyssa, Max and Johnathan into my life. I pray Lord that our friendships with continue to grow even though we can't see each other everyday, I pray that we will continue to lift each other up in prayer through the day. Thank you Lord for all you have done in Portadown and what you are still doing. Love you.
