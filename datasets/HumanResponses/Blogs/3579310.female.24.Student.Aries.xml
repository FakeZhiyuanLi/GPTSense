      Hey All.... Well just keeping you updated on my life My family is slowly piling into Egypt. I was just with my aunt and my cousins who have been taught to say that I am their favorite cousin. I can make them do anything I want by tickling them which is pretty cool. I am ruling the cousinship by force. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA (That was my sinister laugh). Well other than that.... Sherif is here from the states, not my brother, the friend of mine that I was so much in love with. He is telling me he wants us to meet now and see how things go with us and yadda yadda yadda.... You know sometimes you feel like it is too little too late. I wanted to hear that so badly last year but things were just the opposite. Now I am confused.... I feel like I really want it all to happen again but I am scared that things will end like they did before.... I have no clue what to do about Shazly either. He is such an amazing person and everything but then what..... Where will we be in 10 years.... nowhere. We will both be living our respective lives far away from eachother. Maybe a random e-mail every so often but I feel like that is all there will be. So why are things like this now? Why is this so hard? Why do I love the people I shouldn't? And then onto Nassef..... I guess another too little to late story. I do not know how I feel when I am taken for granted and then later on people are like "oh now I see that you are nice.... What do u say?" AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH I just want to scream..... why can't you fucking see me before that????? And now I feel really weird and uncomfortable around him..... Cuz I feel like the apology was great but not good enough..... And so many other stories like this..... it sucks after a while. I used to love it, I used to love getting attention from guys... but now it pisses me off.... I just want to find that ONE guy I am supposed to find and live happily ever after.... I wanna stop taking the stops on the way..... Will I ever make it to that one person? When? How will I know? Will it be worth all of it? Have I already found him and by some mistake lost him? Will it be happy ever after like we are all taught to believe and dream of? Is there really something called happy ever after????  Well other than that I am doing well... just hanging out with the "aganab" (foreigners) that are here... This is a story, of 7 americans picked to live in Egypt.... They are all amazing; Scott - the person I should be able to hate so much but his arrogance just grows on ya ;o)) He also has that southern hospitality which is cool... Eric - just so sweet and kind... he could not be mean if he tried ;o) Izaz - so swwet and kind. I thinkhe has Prada sheets  Holly - We are only friends because we mutually ahte eachother, but we have an amazing time doing so Melanie - The person who is so sweet and helpful, wants to learn so much, just remember... NEVER use her sheesha ;o)) Marianne - Really outgoing and friendly, makes AIESEC feel like what we are doing is apppreciated. So understanding of our mistakes and screw ups..... and now our bonus trainee  Thea - So friendly, kind, and understands when I use Egyptian time which is really good ;o))  I love hanging out with them... I guess this is like my little piece of the US. They are making me feel less homesick here. I thinkhelping them adjust and just understanding what they are seeing and going through is just making me realize and remember how much I have adjusted since I came here.  but the best part of it all is.... FINALLY people understand my jokes. Well if I do not find happily ever after right now I am ok, I am having a pretty cool time now anyways ;o))

      Hey all... Well once again I decided to bless you all with another post... I really have no clue what I will write about so we will find out together.. I have been accepted to an international AIESEC conference. It is called You! Can. It's in Hanover. Germany. I am so excited and so scared that my dad will not let me go... I have to convince him somehow..... it sucks to think that I am 24 and still have to convince him and am so dependent on him. Well anyways I guess it makes life easier ;o)) I have been really busy lately.... AIESEC work hass gotten to be too much. The work of a while LC is being done by 2 people here. There are so many problems. I do not know how to do half the shit I am doing but I am faking my way to success ;o)) I hope I make it all the way there..... I was just remembering how badly i miss my family. You know how when you miss someone so much that your heart really seriously does hurt.... that is what I am feeling now. It is really hard to leave your whole family like this. The sad thing is that they are all together and do not know what it feels like to miss them so much. It is so sad to not have a vivid picture of your mom on your mind. To not have spoken to your brother in so long you cannot even count. To not have attended your sisters wedding and to have never met her husband. To not have seen her in her pregnancy. To have a father that does not see you enough to know anything about you. To be so superficial with all of them because the distance dictates that you do not get any closer. IT HURTS!!!! I also realized one of my bigger problems in living with my aunt stems from the fact that I have all the responsibilities of being her daughter and none of the benefits. You know I have to do what she wants, clean, take care of her kids, run errands, etc etc but I do not get the feeling of unconditional love, of the hug that makes everything right when you are having one of those wrong days. SO I guess I am in the grey areas of all my relationships.  Well summer is about to start... I am already starting on my tan. A lot of people are coming here this summer. All 3 of my half brothers/sister are coming for the whole summer. It will be strange. I do not think I have lived this long with any of them. My dad is staying for a week.....  Ok lets get off that depressing subject.... Yesterday I went to meet with some people to delegate work to, met with the advertising agency to discuss the ad and the take over ceremony for AIESEC. This week I will be meeting with the managers and CEOs of some of the better companies that Alexandria has to offer. This is amazing considerign that I am still in my final year of university. When I graduate I get to write on my CV that I am a Vice President and a member of the executive board of one of the largest global organizations in the world. How amazing is that!!!!!!!!!! Well I will leave on this happier note...

      The weirdiest, creepiest thing has been happening... I have been getting these random calls for a few days.... at first nothing is said... then he started whispering hello in a creepy way, you know like he watched too many horror movies..... so then he starts whispering in English, hello, how are you, I like you.... hahahah so I have an educated stalker... after a while I get annoyed/freaked out so a friend calls to fins who it is.... It turns out to be a guy as old as my grandfather!!!!!!!!!!! He always tells me that I am like his grand-daughter.... PERVERT!!!! So now my dilemna is that I will have to deal with him a lot and I am scared of this guy.... He called me today, and I was like.. "Dr. Mohamed are you ok, why are you whispering? Is something wrong" He did not get embarrassed!!!!!!!!!  I just spent 8 hours fixing my computer... finally it is fixed and I have XP :o)) I was living the hard life of Windows 98... Now I am saved!! Well gotta go, off to drink coffee ;o))
