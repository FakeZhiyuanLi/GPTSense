        (Note: this entry is cross-posted to both of my blogs, in response to harassing comments that have been left by the same user.)   Today's excitement: dealing with this stalker-esque fellow who has been leaving vituperative comments on each of my blogs, some of which I have deleted, only to be met with accusations of "censorship."  The initial source of his angst: the fact that I (along with numerous other bloggers) have one blog with a name that is similar to his. (Go ahead:  urlLink Google the terms "minutiae" and "blog" . Not  all  of the 17,000 results [to date] will necessarily be blogs named "Minutiae," but you get the point.)  I replied to the substance of his tantrum with good humor and generosity of spirit.  His response was to post yet more comments to both blogs -- comments which were devoid of any meaningful content, and which I therefore deleted, as is my prerogative on my own website to do.   For the record:  The first comment I deleted, which I am accused of "censoring," was as follows: "Come visit Victoria Marinelli   [sic]   blog at   [his own blog's URL]   ." We do all kinds of wacky fun things there and crafts too."  This asinine, nonsensical comment, evidently meant to render the appearance that material one could find at  his  blog (the URL for which he had already left in two previous comments) had actually been authored by me, was inherently libelous, so I removed it.  He then waited all of six minutes to post a comment to my second blog. For the record:  The second comment I deleted, which I am accused of "censoring," was as follows: "With girls who beg... Delightedly, Todd Vodka." (This piece of profundity was followed by  another  repeat of his blog's URL.)  Here's where it gets good -- he then registered for  urlLink yet another alias profile on Blogger, using my legal name as his registered name , and then left a third comment on one of my blogs (so that his comment would automatically be prefaced by text reading "Victoria Marinelli said..."). ( That  comment by my impersonator was as follows: "Hey, great site," which, since he is using my legal name, renders the appearance that I am leaving comments on my own blog,  in praise of my own blog  -- something only a pathological narcissist like this moron would actually do.) I had a real laugh when I scanned the "about" section of his alias profile. Quoth my would-be stalker:  Let me come right out and say it: I am not realy [sic] Victoria Marinelli. I would never sleaze on someone else's identity. I wouldn't mess with them that way. I wouldn't censor earnest, well though [sic] out responses, 'cause I'm not some wacky GOP wacko. But hey, that's just me."   But wait: there's more . He even used my name in the URL for the bogus blog under his latest bogus user ID!  So I ask you -- any among you who care to comment (and who are not, say, stewing sociopaths writhing in unwarranted fits of paranoia) -- in deleting those variously trivial comments, was I, indeed,  "censoring earnest, well though [sic] out responses"? (And the poor bastard couldn't even spell  thought  correctly.)  In addition, he's also sent me two private emails (under a name of "bill swensgon"; from an email address bowtmispell@yahoo.com). The bogus Blogger profiles he has set up for the purposes of harassing me may be found (thus far)  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  He bitched at me to link to his site.   Fine, Todd Vodka, or Bill Swensgon, or whoever you are: consider yourself linked.   And consider yourself publicly warned: do not post any further harassing or meaningless messages here. Immediately cease and desist from using my legal name in your bizarre effort to impersonate me. Your conduct is unwelcome, harassing, and libelous, and will be addressed as such. It is likely that in addition to making a fool of yourself, you are violating the terms of service of your ISP, your yahoo account, and your website's host.    Ahem .  And now, I have a  life  that I need to get back to.

      What I've been up to consists of not much more than stewing in the juices of my own anxiety.   Moment from my week: A friend who's taken to behaving as a shut-in calls me; like her, I can't much bear to answer the phone.  Later, I force myself to listen to her message.  She wants to know if I could arrange to meet with her.  It would give her a reason to get out of the house.  But except when I absolutely have to be at work -- its own little anxiety factory -- I'm not getting out much, either.  I still haven't called her back.  She probably thinks I'm judging her.  I'm not.  I'm just in a shitty state.   And tonight I go to pick up my check, and there's another new hire in the kitchen (I shake his hand; I am excruciatingly friendly), plus a note for the chef about yet another applicant.  My co-worker who was fired last week never saw it coming.  Should I be watching my back?    And today was my day off.  Other than one earnest effort to resolve a little bit of complicated bad karma (from my entanglement with Richmond's NOW chapter), I can't say that I did anything productive.  (Now I'm scouring my short-term memory, which is its own wonderland of complication and distraction; surely I must have gotten something else done.  And I come up with this: the dishes. I washed them. Well, I guess that's better than if I hadn't done anything at all.)    This was not how this day was supposed to go.  I was  supposed  to get together with my friend (of recently canned status).  We were going to do some writing.  We were going to do that writing at a coffee shop that was not her former employer and (thus far) my current one.  But then she didn't call.    Was I supposed to call her?  I should have, of course, but there were three sources of hesitation aside from the appallingly generalized ennui.  First: I didn't have anything I felt ready to work on.  (Read: I am emotionally dead.  It's hilarious that I call myself a writer.)  Second: I was suffering from pangs of guilt, because if I  did  keep the coffee/writing date (as I very much wanted to), then the fact that I had not yet returned the other friend's call would make it seem as if I were "playing favorites."  (Better, obviously, to have not called anyone.)  Third: I had this disturbing dream last night.  Actually, it was an extremely pleasurable dream.  It was only when I woke up that I became so disturbed.    There are days when I'd like to assassinate that part of me that writes, that part of me that dreams.    This is one of those days.

      Okay.  That  urlLink thing I wrote  on  Perpetual Exile , about how it seemed like the ongoing pattern of crisis at my dayjob might actually abate?  I dunno if I was being a bit too optimistic.  A co-worker got canned today, over an apparent scheduling misunderstanding.  Noxious vibe hangs in the air; the inevitable question, of course, is "am I next?"  (Though things had been going smoothly -- all things considered -- there is always that factor to be accounted for, which calls for the new boss to slowly pick off the old employees, until everyone in the place is someone he or she has personally hired.  A territorial thing.  Is that what's going on here?  Who the fuck knows.)    Reminder to self: breathe.    Another reminder to self: Re-read that Blogger article, " urlLink How Not to Get Fired Because of Your Blog ."

      I've decided to put up a third blog, " urlLink The Typographical Terror ."  Its description:  A venue for one woman's inner red-pen wielding English teacher. A filing cabinet for materials showcasing obvious spelling and typographical errors, as they are discovered within the news media. From the writer who's geeky enough to wail grammar grievances at scrolling text on cable news channels.  I know it's asking for trouble, in a way, to bitch in this public manner; after all, I regularly find errors in my own writing  after  I've posted it (thank God for retroactive editing options).  But I have a right to be fussy about such errors in news media (and elsewhere).  These folks are getting  paid  to write!  (Or, more generally, to produce media in various formats for public consumption.)    Of course there is the thought that I could parlay this into an employment opportunity...  Alas, the networks whose gaffes I'm placing on public display might not appreciate my efforts.

      Going in to the post office today, I saw a sign at the door stating they'd be closed this coming Friday in recognition of a national day of mourning the death of Ronald Reagan.    My comment to one worker: "Well, at least Reagan's good for a day off."  His reply: "And that's all the guy's ever done for me.  And to think, we're  still  paying off his damned deficit."  Let's hear it for grumpy postal workers.

      I just found this and laughed my ass off.  From Jon Stewart's Commencement Address at William & Mary (also my dad's alma mater):   "We declared war on terror. We declared war on  terror —it’s not even a noun, so, good luck. After we defeat it, I’m sure we’ll take on that bastard ennui."  And then there's this passage: "When I moved to Williamsburg, my hall was in the basement of Yates, which combined the cheerfulness of a bomb shelter with the prison-like comfort of the group shower." This ups the ante for me to reinstate my campaign of harassment -- to get my dad to  finally  cough up the manuscript for his novel, called Yates.  Though for a long time, I thought it was called  Yeats . (Dad was an English major after all.) Now I get it: the novel's setting is, at least in part, his dorm at W&M -- which, coincidentally, my husband's great uncle, Carson Barnes (then the Dean of Men, I think) had my dad thrown out of, for drunkenness.  (This is hysterical, considering the source.)    The looks on both their faces, years later when they met again at our wedding, were priceless.    [Note: full text of Stewart's speech is posted at ProgressiveTrail.org - click  urlLink here  to read it.]

       urlLink   So Jen finally got me  urlLink the latest from David Sedaris . I stared longingly at the book's cover and re-read its table of contents and so, so badly wanted to run away to some chic bookstore/ coffee shop destination and devour the book whole.  The problem with this scenario is that my place of employment, being  urlLink one such chic bookstore/ coffee shop destination , was chock-full of customers harboring similar ideas (whatever  their  reading materials), and I had to make sandwiches for them.  Then I got so involved in one project I had to leave in a whirl, forgetting to clock out, and, what was much worse,  forgetting my Sedaris !  Curses.  Watch out, Sedaris: tomorrow, your ass is mine.

      Well, I've done it again -- stayed up all night on a web project that is also, ostensibly, a writing project.  There's a hell of a lot on my mind, from a friend who was reportedly going to check herself in for depression, to the sudden news from my sister that she's considering going into the Navy.  And then the talk this afternoon with my dad about his move to Idaho (Idaho!), and how strange it is, on the surface, that I have such strong feelings about no longer having a pretext for going back to San Diego -- whereas I still feel entirely empty about the house I lived in with my mother for four years on Kauai (the longest I'd ever lived anywhere, at that point), which was airlifted by Hurricane Iniki and later, bulldozed.  My mother has acted like I'm crazy for reacting to the Idaho news as I have, but others -- including Annalisa, my sister whose new career ambitions have my mother flummoxed --  do  get it.    Whatever.  It will all be clear when it's all written down.  (Perhaps too clear.)   And, damn it, I forgot to email David Weinstock about his wonderful poem,  Gematriya .  But it's 5:45 AM now, and I have to squeeze in some winks before the onslaught of my maternal and employment duties tomorrow.  At least Jen should have David Sedaris's new book in the store by then.

      As it was posted earlier today, this entry had no text besides its title, which began as "Test entry #2." (Yes, you  can  edit your entries after they've posted, and still have them appear under the correct date -- a very handy feature.)  I was still (and I am still) working out some technical glitches, so there was no point, yet, in including any substantive "content" (that WORD!) while I was configuring the layout and features of this "mini-blog" (conceived as a companion venue to  urlLink my main website and blog ).   So imagine my surprise when, within hours of its being posted, I found a comment had already been left by  urlLink a reader .   All I can figure (after a trip to his own site) is that this fellow follows another blog with a similar name, and, since I  did  configure Minutiae to "ping" weblogs.com, it might have appeared there (or elsewhere -- who knows?) as a recently updated blog.    No matter: it's fun to have such a nice and unexpected welcome.  (Now I'm curious: will the comments remain in place as I re-post this entry under its new title?  Stay tuned.)

      So I haven't been blogging or corresponding much.&nbsp; If you've emailed me in the last few weeks or left a comment and haven't heard from me (at least, substantively), trust me, it ain't personal.&nbsp;&nbsp;An unholy shitstorm&nbsp;has been&nbsp;unleashed&nbsp;upon my life, and I'll&nbsp;be cleaning&nbsp;up&nbsp;its aftermath for quite a while.&nbsp;   In the meantime, there's this shot, from the second Ozzfest we went to, in Columbus, Ohio. (Right after said shitstorm-unleashing...&nbsp;for the safety of&nbsp;others, this turned out to&nbsp;be a marvelous time for me to get the fuck out of town).    Yes, Jeff did shave his head; no, the red goatee-dye isn't permanent. &nbsp;

      There is so much happening I can hardly apprehend it all.&nbsp; Whatever happened to  Please, God: no more material ?&nbsp;   Obviously, God isn't listening.&nbsp; Or else, she's listening, but she doesn't give a crap about  my  needs.&nbsp; (Yeah, whatever, God: it's all about  doing what we're&nbsp;put here on earth to do, facing down our demons ...&nbsp;blah, blah, blah.&nbsp; Now tell me another one, while I think about whether, tonight, I should drink, just so that later, I might experience the inner exfoliation of barfing.)   Raw beauty: coffee today, at a new place that's actually sort of close to my house, with a friend I adore, who is a terrific writer, whom I can actually trust to&nbsp;provide an objective, constructive critique of my work.&nbsp; Critique!&nbsp; It's a really important thing.&nbsp; But a bad thing to engage with fools, as I have attempted to do in the past.&nbsp; The result of which has been lots of vague comments about how something or another I've done is "just great, wow, terrific, powerful,"&nbsp; (or else it gets a blank stare), and then me, doggedly sifting through another's words, in hopes of finding some nugget of goodness to point&nbsp;to from within the suffering dilletante's tangle of banal prose or trite poetry.&nbsp; I mean, it's fine to do if you're getting  paid &nbsp;to do that, but otherwise, it's a needless tax on the soul, a mutual waste of time.&nbsp; And here was M, who isn't going to be ruthless for the sake of ruthlessness (that capacity so many artists instinctually inculcate within themselves), because, well, she loves me.&nbsp; As I love her.&nbsp; Which is to say, unsparingly.&nbsp; Which is to say, neither of us is going to let the other off the hook, if something we've written is unclear, or might be better related through another technique, or if it's just unnecessary fat, waiting in clearly bracketed segments for the&nbsp;precision of the&nbsp;editorial knife.&nbsp;   Then: raw anxiety.&nbsp;  That  employment-related situation about which I can't yet publicly speak, or publicly write, at least, not in other than discrete terms.&nbsp; I know that&nbsp;everything is going to work out okay for me.&nbsp; I actually  know  that.&nbsp; But I have a waiting game to attend to, and it's making me stir-crazy.&nbsp;

      That said, that's about how dead my car is. The engine, gone. En route to the in-laws' place, with the idea that we were at least going to get the brake problems dealt with, and get a new radiator whenever we could afford it.   I'm home now for my one day off and trying to write about it.  I have a monstrous headache and I don't  want  to write about anything, but there is really no choice.  This is who I am, this is what I do.  Now there is no running -- or driving -- away from that.  Which makes me wonder if this is all just another example of God's fucked up sense of humor.

      I've been pouring way too much of my life into blogs.  Or else, not enough.  Fuck it, the problem is a simple lack of time.  No, wait, the problem is a lack of time not already dedicated to simple survival shitwork.    So the problem is as old as dirt.  I shall desist with whining.  In a moment, anyhow.  It bears mentioning that I am in the throes of not only financial but veterinary crisis.  Callie, one of my cats, has been chewing herself into one ugly mass of raw, blood-soaked furball.  Allergies?  There are no fleas in evidence.  Anyhow, she is getting the home remedy of the plastic cone-head attachment (she is  not  amused), with liberal amounts of cortisone spray to the affected sites, all the while my husband and I struggle to hold her down.  (With two adult humans restraining one cat wrapped in the kitty-straightjacket, a.k.a. large beach towel, you'd think she couldn't move an inch.  But Jesus, can that cat move.)     Callie: Not Amused     Don't yell at me to take her to the vet unless you're planning to cover the bill.  Similarly, don't cluck with disapproval at the fact that my car essentially has neither brakes nor a radiator unless you're planning to cover  that  bill. (We are going to try to deal with the brakes tomorrow, driving it ever so gingerly to my in-laws' in Williamsburg... with eight rather than the usual four gallons of water stored in the trunk, for the inevitable roadside filling-of-the-radiator ritual I am now performing an average of three times a day.)    And please, don't gawk at my commentaries elsewhere over going to shows --  how can you afford it, if things are really that bad? ... etc.  The sad truth: one reason my musical tastes have shifted so much to the side of metal, lately, may be that our friends are in such bands, and we're on their guest lists.    And sometimes, we even get free shirts and stuff.  Witness our youngest in her finest L.O.G. wear:   Raising the Next Generation of Metalheads?     Hopefully, all of this is random and "off-the-cuff" enough.  Notice: I'm still not saying Word One about work. Because if I did, Word One would lead to Words Two and Three and 7,000, and then you'd be almost as tired as me, and I'd still have to open the place at 6:30 A.M. tomorrow -- yes, that's tomorrow, as in  Sunday , the day I said I could never work because it was my husband's only day off -- and I still wouldn't have written anything real tonight toward any real book.

      I had something better I wanted to upload, but Blogger is refusing to allow me FTP access to my site (for the last 24 hours).  I'll wait it out for now, and if it continues to be a problem I'll contact their tech support later, but right now I'm too tired to care.  Meantime, there's an autogenerated blogroll which can, at least, be found in the sidebars for both this blog and  urlLink Perpetual Exile .  So go blog hopping to your hearts' content.  Now I'm going to see if I can get away with a quick nap.

      Blogger is being very buggy right now, refusing to let me edit my template, and then actually eating the entire text of an entry I was about to put up. (Fortunately it wasn't that long of an entry, but  still. ) Grrrr.  Fuck this. I need some espresso,  now . (Will resume with template renovations later, when I'm properly caffeinated and once I've picked up the kids from their sleepover...)    Update, Monday 8/9/04:   Some progress on the links update front, but not enough to post yet. Rest assured that the current lack of certain links does not constitute a diss. Now, forgive me if I spend most of the coming week dealing trying to extract my unemployed ass from its current condition of abject poverty and despair. "All things internet" which are not directly relevant to said extraction efforts are gonna have to wait.   Now: time for more espresso.   Update #2, Tuesday 8/10/04:   I had everything set up and ready to upload and now I can't ftp into my site.  What the hell?    And I'm actually trying to give up espresso.  It's just another indulgence like, say, car insurance (or a car to go with that insurance), or my kids' summer school program which I'm having to take them out of, that I can't afford.  (Consequently, I have a monstrous headache.)

      Innocently, I checked out a friend's blog today, and discovered that my own junior blog here was, in part, the topic of  urlLink a long, contentious discussion  which had already attracted loads of comments. I posted  urlLink my own comment on the debacle , and left it at that. I barely have time to keep up with my own stuff, much less the little internecine wars between pixelated persons I've never met.  Valium, anyone? (And now, back to freaking out about money.)   Update : like a moth to the flame, I just  had to  check out my friend's comment log one more time before going to bed, and got  urlLink riled up all over again .  Damn.  Now I'm  really  turning off the computer.
