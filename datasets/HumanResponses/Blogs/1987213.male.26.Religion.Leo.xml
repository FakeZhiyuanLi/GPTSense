      Driving to the office this morning I was listening to  urlLink Phil Joel .  He is the bass player for Newsboys, but has a couple of solo projects on the side.  One of his songs just blows me away.  Read these words to his song, The Man You Want Me to Be.   I played the fool so long Thought I was so strong All the while You knew it wasn’t true Rerunning in my mind Memories of another time When all I ever lived for Was You  Chorus: Jesus Make me the man You want me to be Jesus Make me the man You want me to be  I’ve been listening all my life Words are spoken all the time I have heard the liars and the true Voices twisting in the air Sweetly sounding so unclear But nothing can replace a word From You  A child is but for so long Turn around those days are gone Nothing can replace the years of youth I have swallowed lies That tasted true The plans I thought were sent from You When all You wanted was for me To be still  The burning in the heart Of man’s deepest desire Is rising like a flame  The burning in the heart  Of our deepest desire Rising like a flame Burning higher and higher Burning in the heart Of our deepest desire Is to know You

      In the adult Sunday School class that I teach we are going through the life of Elijah.  Yesterday we got to the part in his life where Jezebel threatened his life, so he ran all the way to Beersheba and then a days journey into the wilderness.  He was afraid.  My question to the class was "Why in the world was he afraid after all that he had seen God do in his life?"  (Read the story if you want to see all that God had done for him up to this point)  One of the answers that came back to me was that maybe he had just worn out... He was tired.   I think that answer is correct.  Once we get worn out and we just get fatigued then all of our reasoning goes out the door.  We don't see anything except for our fatigue.  Visions of God's work becomes visions of MY exhaustion.  I think Elijah needed a Sabbath Day.  A day of rest and a day of reflection.  That is what the Sabbath was all about... Remembering what God had done.  It helps us not to forget.  Maybe we all need a Sabbath Day.  I don't see anything wrong with it.  Do you?

      The world today is in a mess.  I'm not saying the world is worse today than it was yesterday, or even 200 years ago, but it is in a mess.  Let's get real!  We have played church for way too long.  It is time to be the church.  We place so much emphasis on what the early church did, but we forget sometimes that what the early church was doing.  They were trying to imitate Jesus.  I do believe that we need Sunday mornings set aside as a time to worship as  family, and I even believe that we have enough evidence to say that was really important in the New Testament.  But, let us not forget that Jesus walked the streets.  He made the nobodies feel like somebodies.  He fed the poor.  He wept for the hurting.  He made a difference in the lives he came in contact with everyday.   While we are trying to restore the life of the early church remember that the early church was trying to imitate Jesus.  Over half of our communities will never see what we do in a building for two hours on Sunday morning.  If you think about it, that is really the only time the world is NOT watching you.  Let us not forget to imitate Jesus as he walked the streets changing lives... the Jesus with dirty feet!

      I am a minister for a church that belongs to what we like to call "The Restoration Movement."  I have grown up in this movement my whole life.  It seems like sometime we forget this is a movement.  It is continual and never ending.  It is a movement constantly devoted to restoring the life of the early church.  I have met a lot of people who for some reason believe we have restored it.  They believe there is nothing left to try to restore.  I'm saddened by the arrogance of that belief.  It is sad to think that we can believe Man has totally restored something that God created. I recently took a class in my Masters program on 1 and 2 Corinthians.  Man, let me tell you, that class made me realize that there are a whole lot more questions than answers when it comes to God's Word.  It humbled me and made me realize the movement to restore the life of the early church and to restore the vision that God had for the church is a never ending endeavor.   I love the idea of the restoration movement.  I only hope that I never deceive myself by thinking it has been restored and then give up. Peace

      It is a little crazy to think that anyone would want to read any random thoughts from a red head, especially this red head.  Hopefully I will be able to make my thoughts interesting enough to keep you interested, although I can't always promise they will be.  For now I will let you know who I am. My name is Gilbert and I am 25 yrs. old.  I am happily married to my best friend from college.  I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University and I am currently working on my Masters in Bible from David Lipscomb University.  I am an Associate Minister for a church of Christ in Bowling Green, KY and feel totally unqualified for the tasks that lie ahead of me.  But, who does feel qualified for the work God has in store for them? Hopefully, tomorrow I will have something more interesting to talk about than myself.  Peace

      Last night my wife and I had two couples over for dinner.  They have both been visiting Greenwood Park for a while now (one has already placed membership).  We had a blast just sitting in our living room on the floor eating chilli.  We talked and laughed forever.  It was great getting to know them better.  Now I know why the early church, as recorded in Acts, went from house to house eating with glad and sincere hearts.  It is so much fun. Next time you get the chance, invite a visitor from church over for dinner.  It is great!

      Here is a nice story for all of you baldheaded people to tell kids for Halloween.  2 Kings 2:23-24   23 Elisha left and headed toward Bethel. Along the way some boys started making fun of him by shouting, "Go away, baldy! Get out of here, baldhead!"   24 Elisha turned around and stared at the boys. Then he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Right away two bears ran out of the woods and ripped to pieces forty-two of the boys.

      Have you ever thought about how much faith God must have?  Think about it.  He randomly chose the Israelites to be His people and expected them to be a light unto the other nations.  They whined, complained, rebelled, rejected Him, and never fully kept God's commands.  Yet, He never gave up on them being a light unto other nations.  He never said,  "Well, I guess I'll pick another nation because Israel obviously isn't ever going to get it right."   He chose them and loved them and must have had some sort of faith in them. Think about he faith He must have in people today.  I know that God works in mysterious ways and can make things happen any way He wants, but for some odd reason He has left the preaching of the Gospel in our hands.  He took the life of Jesus and the truth of the death, burial, and resurrection and He put it in words so that  WE  could spread the message.  He trust us to get to His message to others.  He now trust us to be a light unto the nations.   It has to take some tremendous faith to believe I can do those things for Him.

      The shortest verse in the bible is John 11:35.  Everyone knows it.   Jesus wept.   I love that verse because for such a short verse it tells us so much.  Jesus, God in the flesh, wept.  He felt heartbreak and pain.  In this particular verse he is weeping because a close friend had died.  Although that is the only time we have a record of him weeping I know he felt heartbreak and pain at other times.  He looked over at Jerusalem and wished he could take them under his protective wing like a chicken with her hens.  He felt pain when he saw them living the way they were.  He felt the pain of those who had no hope in this life and wanted to make things better for them.  I'm sure he felt hunger pains as he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights.  I'm sure he wept many times for various things.  The most excruciating pain of all that he felt was the pain of sin as he hung on the cross.  For  our  sins he took the punishment and the pain.  What John 11:35 tells me is that Jesus was human.  Yes, he was God in the flesh.  He showed us who God is.  He was "God with us."  But, we need not forget that he was also human.  That is something we will fully figure out, but scripture tells us he was God and human all at the same time.  If we take away his human nature then we loose sight of how awesome a life he lived here on earth.  Yep, Jesus wept. What do you think?

       Pop Quiz  Jesus said that all people will know who his disciples are when:  A.  They see the sign out front that reads Church of Christ B.  They hear that good ol' a cappella singing C.  They see the correct pattern of worship D.  They see the church love each other as Christ loved them   What do you think?

      "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."  Each day He created something new He would look at it and say that it was good.  It was perfect.  It had order.  It was the way it was supposed to be.  After a full week of creating the world the scriptures say, "And God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was  very good ." We sure have messed things up since then!

      Let me tell you what has been bothering me lately.  Martin Luther King Jr. said, back during the Civil Rights Movement, that the most segregated time of the week is at 10:00am on Sunday mornings.  Decades later I look around at our churches and realize that is still true today.  There are some exceptions, but overall that is still a true statement.  I work for a church that averages around 550 people every Sunday and we have ONE African American couple.  ONE!!   This past Sunday we had two black families come to visit our worship services.  I tried my very best to talk to them and make them feel welcome, but I'm a little worried they won't be back because we are too white.  I pray that they will overlook that flaw, and yes I did call it a flaw. Larry Cantrel, a black minister in Tallahassee, once came to speak at a devotional held by the campus ministry at MTSU.  Our campus ministry had around 150 students and only three or four of them were black.  Larry said,  "We are commanded to go into all the world preaching the gospel to everyone.  A command to evangelize.  But, most of our churches today are not equipped to do that.  We have hurt ourselves when it comes to this command.  Why?  Because an all white church can't reach the world.  Just like an all black church can't reach the world.  We are ill equipped to reach those that look different than us and we won't fix that problem until we can get together."  That was probably 4 years ago and I can't help but think about what he said every time I walk into a church building.  Sometimes I want to ask our only black couple at church what they see when they walk through those doors every Sunday and Wednesday but I'm a little scared to hear their answer.  I'm scared they are being way more patient and tolerant of our ignorance than I would be in their situation.  The reason I say "our" ignorance is because I am just as guilty as anyone else.   I pray that God will forgive me.

      Did you know there are some things that God doesn't know?  Well there are.  Try these on for size:   1.  God does not know a sin that He doesn't hate. 2.  God does not know a sinner that He doesn't love. 3.  God does not know a better way to be saved than through His Son.   Man, I thought God knew everything... I guess I was wrong. Peace

      I just finished doing chapel for a bunch of preschoolers and then for K-6th graders.  Those kids have passion.  They are eager to lead songs, answer questions, pray, and just about anything else you ask them to do.  Man, just think... If we as adults had that kind of passion and eagerness we would turn this world upside down.  Could you imagine Sunday mornings?  How about the impact on our communities?   I always get intimidated when I get ready to speak to those little ones, but I always end up leaving with a call to be more like them.  Thank God for children! Peace

      I must admit that I am disappointed that the Cubs didn't win either of the last two games in the series.  It would have been awesome to see them go to the World Series.  But, I believe I am even more saddened for "the fan that got in the way."  I don't blame him at all for what happened.  I would have done the same thing, and so would have everyone else in that ballpark that night.  I truly do feel bad for this guy, even to the point of praying for his safety last night.  The saddest part is that he will forever be known as the famous fan who lost the game for the Cubs.  He has been branded with that image for life.  Give him a break!  He didn't do anything wrong. Random thought... What if I become forever known by my Savior as the one who got in the way... of someone's salvation.  How sad that would be.  My prayer is that none of us ever becomes known as "the fan who got in the way." Peace

      A professor at Lipscomb shared a poem with the class.  I thought I would share it with you.  One night I had a wondrous dream One set of footprints there were seen The footprints of my precious Lord But mine were not seen along the shore But then some stranger prints appreared And I asked the Lord, "What have we here? Those prints are large and round and neat, But Lord, they are too big for feet"  "My child," He said in somber tones, "For miles I carried you alone. I challenged you to walk in faith, But you refused and made me wait. You disobeyed you would not grow, The walk of faith you would not know."  "So I got tired, I got fed up, And there I dropped you on your butt. Because in life, there comes  a time, When one must fight, and one must climb, When one must rise and take a stand, Or leave their butt prints in the sand."   I'm not sure who wrote that, but I thought it was funny.  I hope you enjoyed it too. Peace

      The Christian Chronicle's web extras had an article about Caedmon's Call playing at Oklahoma Christian University.  During one of the songs the students were singing so loudly that Caedmon's Call quit playing their instruments.  Cliff, the lead singer, said, "That's right, I forgot that y'all are the denomination that doesn't use instruments, so you can really sing!"  They played a few more songs and each time the band would put down their instruments.  At the end Cliff mentioned how awesome the experience was and even said, "You make me want to change my doctrine ... Almost." Leonard Sweet, a well known Christian author and Methodist, recently attended the Zoe Conference in Nashville.  He was blown away by the singing that took place there and pleaded with the audience to not throw away their "tribal sound" as he called it.  He said we are to be proud of our name and our a cappella heritage. I met a Lutheran minister the other day and he found out I was a minister in the Church of Christ.  He said that he loved the way we sing.  He even went on to say that sometimes in the middle of their worship services he will stand up and say, "Let's do it Church of Christ style!"   Hmmmmm... I've said it before that I am not going to condemn to hell anyone who uses instruments in worship.  I'm fine with that.  But, I do have to ask myself, "Why are so many of us trying to get rid of our a cappella tradition?  What are we so embarrassed about?" What do you think?

      If you open up to the first chapter of Deuteronomy you will find out that the 40 year journey through the wilderness actually should've only taken  ELEVEN DAYS .  That just blew me away when I first saw read that.  Rebellion, selfishness, and stubbornness turned an 11 day journey into 40 yrs.   Isn't that the way it always goes?  We try to do things our own way and we end up "wandering through the the wilderness" for a whole lot longer time than it should actually take when all we had to do was listen to God.  His way is always the right way, and often the quickest way.  When will we ever learn?   Let's not turn 11 days into 40 yrs!  Peace

      Well, I'm back from vacation.  What did I do?  I spent a lot of time in front of the TV watching the Cubs play ball.  I ate a lot of seafood.  I took a little swim in the ocean.  Oh, and I puked my guts out while my wife caught the biggest fish on the boat we were on!  I was miserable on the boat.  There were about 35 people on this boat fishing and Kate caught the biggest fish of the day all while I was hanging over the edge of the boat throwing up whatever I had in my stomach.  Nice thought, huh?  It was not fun. Overall, though, I had a great time.

      Go  urlLink Cubs !!!  I hope everyone had a good day worshipping God with your church families this weekend.  I sure did.  Steve Tyree, campus minister for Greenwood Park, preached on fearing the giants.  He asked the question, "What are our giants today?"  It is interesting to note that the most repeated command in the bible is, in one form or another, "Do not fear."  One of the biggest reasons I don't do half of the things I probably should do is because of fear.  The biggest reason we don't evangelize like we should is fear.  The reason we don't confront our friends and family when we know we should is because of fear.  Must I go on?  No wonder the most repeated command is "do not fear." We are to fear God.  We are told to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.  But, that is a healthy fear.  That is a fear that is shown out of respect and reverence for a God who is the creator of all things.  It is a fear that puts God and man in our respective places.   The fear that we are not to have is an unhealthy fear.  It is a fear that shows a lack of faith.  As a matter of fact I would be willing to say that fear is the absence of faith, and vice versa.  Be strong and courageous and do not be afraid! What do you think?

      Have you ever thought about your mission?  Do you even have one?  I haven't read The Purpose Driven Life or The Purpose Driven Church, or any of the other Purpose Driven books, but I do believe that we need to live with a purpose.  We need to have a mission; as a church and as an individual. Jesus lived with his mission always before him.  In Luke's Gospel account we find that Jesus stated his mission early in his journey.  We find him in the synagogue reading from Isaish saying,  "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has annointed me to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent me me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."   He rolls the scroll back up and then throughout the rest of Luke's Gospel account we can see Jesus living out that mission everyday.  He did give good news to the poor.  He did release those who were prisoners because of Satan.  He did give the blind back their sight (both physically and spriritually).  He did lift up the oppressed.  And, he most certainly did proclaim the year of the Lord's favor! Do you have a mission?

      Well, the Cubs didn't win last night, but they still have a few more games in the series.  It is tied at 1 game a piece. Does anyone get the  urlLink Christian Chronicle ?  This month has an article on a few churches of Christ who have added instruments to their worship services.  The writer of the article along with a few others that he interviewed thought this was a tragedy within the churches of Christ.  They even implied that it was the beginning of a lack of respect for the authority of scripture. If you want to know where I stand on this issue then read this quote from Rubel Shelley.  He sums up my thoughts nicely.    I am deeply committed to a cappella music.  I do my best to make a strong, reasonable, biblical case for it.  I would oppose anyone's efforts to introduce it into our congregational worship at Woodmont Hills.  In my view, it would be divisive and therefore wrong for anyone to attempt to do so.  I'm not about to champion instrumental music for the Church of Christ.  I do plead however, for a more creative, passionate, and worshipful use of vocal music.  Human voices compelled by hearts zealous for Christ are capable of producing powerful, God-honoring, and participant inspiring praise.  I am an unabashed defender of our a cappella legacy.  But when someone wants me to go further and to condemn to hell someone who doesn't agree with my view, or to criticize congregations that choose to use instruments because they believe it will assist in their outreach in a community different from mine, I have no interest in pursuing the discussion.  Instrumental music and the atonement are not of the same status or consequence to the human soul and its eternal welfare.  What do you think?  Email me and let me know.

      Man, I must be a big weenie.  I didn't eat breakfast this morning and I am starving.  My stomach is growling and I want to eat.  How did Jesus make it 40 days without any food?  Not only did he last that long without food, but he did it on purpose.  Well, he did eat something... it is not what I normally call food, but he feasted on it.  At another point in Jesus' life he is found talking with a Samaritan woman.  As she leaves him the disciples return from a trip to the city.  The figure Jesus to be hungry from a long morning on the road so they beg him to eat.  In response Jesus says,  "I have food to eat that you do not know about."   Jesus finds fulfillment in doing the work of God.  As the NIV Application Commentary says, "Obeying the Father is Jesus' more deeply satisfying task."  Jesus feasted on the work and words of the Father.  Richard Foster, in Celebration of Discipline, says that fasting is feasting!  Have you ever feasted on the work and words of God and been satisfied?  I would love to try it, but I'm gonna go get a biscuit, hahaha!

       "Mass evangelism is not the best way of evangelism, but it seems to be the way that God has entrusted me, and I must be faithful to it.  The best way of evangelism is when there are two people talking together and one leads the other to Jesus."

      I heard someone say yesterday, "Jesus has called us all to be fishers of men, not fish processors!"  That is so true.  Jesus' call was for us to throw the net out there and see what we can catch.  It isn't our job to clean them.  That is the Spirit's job.  I've seen people who want to be baptized into Christ's name have to wait because the preacher (or whoever this person asked) has told them they need more work, or they need to know more, or they need to get rid of this or that in their life.  How sad.  We can't expect someone to act like a Christian before they get the Spirit in their life.  It is the Spirit that gives them the power to change and become more pure... We can't expect that to happen before they get the Spirit in their life.  Nope, we weren't called to be fish processors.  We were called to be fishers of men.  Let the Spirit do the cleaning. What do you think?

The dad looked her in the eyes and said,  "Honey, we all think life isn't fair because we are all under the impression that we deserve something, but who is to say what we deserve and what we don't deserve?"  That really stuck with me.  I do believe that we all live with this assumption that we deserve something.  When things don't go our way then we want to cry out to God,  "Why?"  as if He should explain Himself.  We think this or that shouldn't be happening, but what makes us think that?   No, it is not about deserving or earning anything.  God doesn't have to explain himself.  Besides, if we got everything we deserved... Well, it would be ugly.  If anyone deserved or earned all things good, it is God.  If anyone should be complaining that life isn't fair, it is God.  Just think about it.  His creation rejected him and turned to other gods.  He gives them 2nd chance after 2nd chance yet He is still rejected.  He had to watch His son die because we couldn't get it right. Well, I think I have rambled enough.  Peace

       Two Songs I Don't Understand  1.   Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Anybody       What is up with this song?  I never said I wasn't gonna tell anybody, sing about it, or pray about it.  I just can't connect with this song.  I've heard it said that this is one of those songs that gets you to connect with a person in the bible.  In this case it is suppose to be someone Jesus healed, then Jesus told him not to tell anyone.  I'm sorry, but I can't connect with that person.  I can sing songs that talk about how it should've been me on the cross, or I was blind but now I can see, or I was slave but now I'm free.  But, now Jesus tells us all to tell the world everything that he has done.  He has never told me to not tell anyone.  Well, that is my take on that song.  2.   Jesus is Coming Soon       I really have problems with this one.  Just think about the words.   Troublesome times are near.  Filling men's hearts with fear.  Freedom we all hold dear now is at stake.   Another line says,  "Many will meet their doom."   Now, don't get me wrong.  There are some good lines in this song, but have you ever thought about the words that I just wrote and then thought about how we sing it?  We sing it like we are in a pep rally or a parade.  It is all peppy and upbeat.  It sounds like we should be going, "Troublesome times are near, yeehaa.  Many will meet their doom, woohoo."  It is funny if you ask me. Well, I hope I didn't make fun of your favorites song or songs.  That is just what goes through my head when we sing one of those songs at church or in a bible study.

      I bought  urlLink John Mark Hicks  new book last night.  It is called  Down in the River to Pray .  It is a study on baptism.  All through the opening chapter you run across this sentence, "Baptism in more important than you think, but not for the reasons you suppose."  I hope that sentence will tickle your ear and make you interested in buying the book.  I have only read through the middle of chapter 2 but so far it is great.  It is written in the same manner as his other book,  Come to the Table .  When I get done with it I will let you know my thoughts, but I suggest you go ahead and get it yourself. Take care

      Gospel Meetings are everywhere.  Sunday morning I attended the first day of a gospel meeting in Alabama.  The congregation I currently minister to is in the middle of a gospel meeting.  There is another church down the road from me having a gospel meeting.  I've seen fliers posted throughout our church building that are advertising gospel meetings.  Man, they are everywhere.  Here is the question that has been rattling around my little brain... What are they for?  Why do churches have them?  I know at one time they were used as huge evangelistic meetings and revivals, but what do we use them for now.  The only people I see attending them are church members of the congregation I attend and church members from area congregations who want to hear our speaker.  Do we just have them because it is something we have always done?  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy them.  I just want to know their purpose.  Any suggestions?

      I really like the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector found in Luke's gospel account.  It starts off by saying,  "To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everbody else."   I have grown up in churches that were confident in themselves, and in bible classes we would look down on other churches as we discussed the "unbiblical" things that they did.  We sounded like the Pharisee who prayed,  "God, I thank you that I am not like other men."   If anyone has heard me speak or attended a class that I teach then they know that I will not use that time to discuss what others do.  But, that does not mean that I am not guilty of falling into the confidence trap.  It is very tempting. This parable does not just apply to individuals, but also to churches.  We need to watch what we say and how we look at others.  Let's be like the Tax Collector and worry about ourselves.  Not in some selfish manner, forgetting that there are those who don't know Christ.  But, as we approach God's throne in prayer or when we are teaching the body of Christ lets focus on our own unworthiness and our own faults so that we can better ourselves.  Being better than the next church doesn't bring us any closer to God... it is about being better than  we  were yesterday. What do you think?

       urlLink You better read  Purpose Driven Life  or else ... Or else what?  Well, according to the elders of a church in Memphis the "or else" is being asked to leave.  They have made an announcement stating that they will take members off of the membership role if they haven't read the book and started fulfilling their purpose.  This is no joke.  They plan on giving all of their members a test with multiple choice questions and essays to see if they have read and understand the book.  Read it or else!  I'm not about to start demanding that people read the book.  That would be just plain wrong.  But, I think their is something to be said about their stance on fulfilling purposes.  Members who just want to show up, especially those who just want to show up for the Lord's Supper and leave, need to be shaken up.  Jesus absolutely despises mediocrity.  He said he either wanted someone to be hot or cold, no in between because he will spew them out of his mouth.  That is pretty strong language.  Why do we allow the "pew fillers" to come week after week without ever placing an expectation on them?    Those elders' philosophy was, "Get to work or fill someone else's pew.  We want workers at this church."    I like it.  What do you think?

      Hola!  I just got back from Honduras visiting the Baxter institute which is a preaching school.  That place is just awesome.  I loved every minute of it.  I wish I could just bring the people back with me. It gave me a new perspective on things.  People down there live in one or two room houses with a family of around 8 people.  They either have dirt floors or some kind of cheap tiles.  Their roofs leak so they have plastic over their dinner table and chairs.  They still go outside to an outhouse.  I could go on and on, but I won't.   I'm so petty.  I want more money, a better car, a bigger house, and the nicest shoes.  I complain about stupid little things while they have to live with security guards at McDonalds holding a shotgun and machine gun.  One night I heard four gunshots and sirens.   They also have bigger dreams than I do.  I am content with coming to my office and planning my sermon for Sunday.  They are planning evangelistic campaigns to Chile and Columbia.  Teenagers at that school are visiting adults who haven't been going to church to ask why.  They are in the trenches while I am at headquarters staying safe.  It really changes the way I look at things. Well, I better get back to preparing my sermon, haha.

       Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgement on disputable matters  (Romans 14:1). What are disputable matters?  I think you could ask five different people and get five different answers.  Another problem is that some people don't think there are disputable matters... If you don't believe what they believe then you are flat wrong.  It isn't even up for dispute.  Who decides what is disputable and what isn't?  Man, question after question after question.   Any thoughts?

      We all know that the apostles said to Jesus,  "Increase our faith!"  But, have you ever noticed what caused them to make that command?  It comes right after Jesus tells the disciples that if anyone has done wrong against them and repents of it then they are to forgive that person,  even if he sins against you seven times a day!   That statement of Jesus led the apostles to request, or command, an increase in their faith.  That amazes me every time I read that passage.  Forgiveness, compared to all the other things we are commanded to do, seems like such a small thing.  Forgiveness should be easy, right?  We all know that is a lie.  It is hard to forgive someone of a wrong that has been committed against you, especially if it is a loved one.  We may say that we forgive them, but do we truly forgive?  It still lingers in the back of our minds.  We sometimes use it against that person in the future.  We even have a hard time truly trusting that person.  I'm not talking about little annoyances that happen everyday.  I'm talking about things that truly hurt deep in one's heart.  It is hard to forgive those things.  That is why the apostles immediately said, "Increase our faith!"  They knew it would be tough. Now, think about our sins against the Father.  Think of the things we have done in our lives that scream "rejection!" in God's face.  I think of how hard it is to forgive someone and I read a passage like Colossians 2:13 that says,  "When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your heart, God made you alive together with Christ.  God forgave us of all our sins."   Man, that must be tough.  I sure do love my God.

      The problem with legalism, or patternism, is that it all comes down to being perfect or having the right pattern... Well, we all know we can't attain perfection.  So, it must come down to who is closest to the truth, or closest to the pattern... Well, the problem with that idea is that there will always be someone closer to the truth than me or you, and there will always be someone closer to the truth than that person.  On and on it goes.  I sure am glad that  it is by grace that I am saved, through faith - and this is not from myself, it is a gift of God - not by works, so that I have no room to boast (Eph. 2:8).   It is not about me being perfect and it isn't about me being closer to the truth than the next person.  It is about God being a gracious God who wants me to be in a relationship with him. What do you think?

       "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves."  Matthew 7:15  How many times have you read this written in some religious journal or heard some preacher use it to describe someone with whom he differs in some biblical matter?  For some reason it is impossible for someone to come to a different interpretation of a passage than some of these so-called "defenders of the faith."  We can no longer be sincere in our faith and come to a different conclusion on a matter than what they perceive to be the right conclusion.  Nope.  If that happens then no matter how much you love Jesus, or how zealous you are for biblical studies you are labeled a  false prophet  and a wolf that has dressed up in sheep's clothing secretly trying to lead the flock in the wrong direction.  I heard Mike Cope once say that he will talk to anyone who disagrees with him on some biblical matter, except the person who claims he is simply insincere in his faith.  I like that.  I'm sure that in all the time that God has given and will give me on this earth I will come to more than a few misinterpretations of a passage, and I will talk with anyone about that except the person who doubts my love of God because of my honest misinterpretation.  I honestly pray that the "defenders of the faith" will not make any honest mistakes in their study of the bible because I believe in a God who said  for in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you (Matthew 7:2).

      Al Maxey's new Reflection is entitled Theology  Ex Nihilo .  Ex Nehilo is Latin for "out of nothing."  A theology out of nothing.  Maxey writes, "unless extreme caution is exercised in our interpretation of the sacred writings, we may well find ourselves embracing a theology  ex nihilo . What a sobering thought: that some of our practices and beliefs may not be firmly established upon a foundation of ultimate, objective Truth, but rather upon little more than willful, even wishful, expressions of a self-made religion."  Years and years of tradition within all church groups, including the churches of Christ, have surely biased our interpretation of things found (or not found) in the Bible.  It is hard not to interpret the Bible through the traditional lens that have been passed down from generation to generation.  Most of us "good church folk" open the Bible with a belief already in place and so we use the Bible to reinforce that belief, rather than going to the Bible with an open mind and heart ready to allow the Bible to give us something to believe.  I'm not pointing a finger at anyone, because I do the same.  It is hard not to.  But I have to listen to Jesus as he soundly rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for invalidating the Word of God for the sake of their traditions, stating that their worship was in vain because they were elevating the doctrines of men rather than esteeming those of God (Matthew 15:6, 9).  Al Maxey stated that, "One of the reasons for so much division within the Body of Christ is that far too many persons seek to impose their own theology upon the Scriptures, instead of extracting our Lord's teaching from out of those inspired writings. This tendency is an example of theology  ex nihilo . If the only basis for our religious preferences and practices is an appeal to what God didn't say, or the creative manipulation of what He did, we have formulated a theological system "out of nothing!"   Let us all work together in fighting the temptation to extract a theological position  ex nihilo !  Open the Word and let it speak to you rather than you trying to put words in It's mouth.  What do you think?

      A great quote from John Yoder  The believer's cross is no longer any and every kind of suffering, sickness, or tension, the bearing of which is demanded.  The believer's cross must be, like his Lord's, the price of his social nonconformity.  It is not, like sickness or catastrophe, an inexplicable, unpredictable suffering; it is the end of a path freely chosen after counting the cost.  It is not... an inward wrestling of the sensitive soul with self and sin; it is the social reality of representing in an unwilling world the Order to come.   Here is a great paradox taken from Lee Camp's new book, Mere Discipleship.  The cross of Jesus signifies for the disciple both Christ dying in our stead (so that we need not die as slaves to sin, for his atoning sacrifice has undone the power of sin unto death), and Christ calling us to die with him (so that we must be willing to die with him, for rebellious powers have yet to accept his lordship).  That is, the cross proclaims that we need no longer die as a consequence of our sins, and yet we must die, or be willing to do so, because of the world's sins.

      My patience is being tested!  We just got a new puppy.  His name is Cooper.  He is the cutest thing, but don't let looks fool you.  He pees every five minutes on the carpet.  He is getting better at going to the door, but he still has little accidents every so often.  He is as stubborn as it gets.  If he doesn't want to do it then he isn't gonna do it.  You can call his name, pat your leg, whistle, snap, kneel down and beg, but if he doesn't want to get up and come to you then he isn't going to.  I don't know who is training who.  Is he training me or am I training him?  Sometimes I wonder. I think all Christians need a Cooper in thier life.  He will definitely work on your patience which is something we all need work on.

      I did some homework and got the Gospel Advocate list of the so-called "10 most dangerous books recently published by members of the Church of Christ."  I have actually read five of them and I just bought a sixth one last night.  Here they are: 1.   A Church that Flies  by Tim Woodroof 2.   Come to the Table  by John Mark Hicks 3.   The Crux of the Matter  by Jeff Childers, Douglas Foster, and Jack Reese 4.   God's Holy Fire  by Kenneth Cukrowski, Mark Hamilton, and James Thompson 5.   In the Grip of Grace  by Max Lucado 6.   The Jesus Proposal  by Rubel Shelly and John York 7.   Radical Restoration  by F. Lagard Smith 8.   Reviving the Ancient Faith  by Richard Hughes 9.   Trusting Women  by Billie Silvey 10.   Unveiling Glory  by Frederick Aquino and Jeff Childers  Like I said, I have five of those and just bought a sixth.  They haven't caused me any harm yet.  I may not totally agree with all of them, but overall I thought they were good.  I would recommend reading them.

      "WARNING: These Books May Be Hazardous to Your Spiritual Health." That's the title of an article in the Gospel Advocate--an article that warns about the 10 most dangerous books recently published by members of the Church of Christ.  I don't receive the Gospel Advocate so I haven't seen this article which means I don't know which books were listed.  If anyone knows then please email me and give me the list.  I'm sure I have a few on the list and for the ones I don't have... I think I may have to get them, hahaha.  They have got to be good if they were put on that list.   I found out about this on  urlLink Mike Cope's  blog page.  He was a little disappointed that none of his books were on the list.  Well Mike, better luck next time!

       Lesson #5   You were supposed to be there.   You really need to read the book to understand what the context is of that lesson, but it fits right in with Esther 4:14, "For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father's house will perish.  And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?"  Read Esther to get the context of that also and it will start to make sense.  Also read  The Five People You Meet in Heaven .

       Lesson #4   Life on earth ends.  Love never dies!   "Love never fails... And now these three remain:  faith, hope and love.  But the greatest of these is love."  1 Corinthians 13:8, 13  "God is love.  Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him... There is no fear in love."  1 John 4:16, 18

       Lesson #3   Holding anger is a poison.  It eats you from inside.  We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us.  But hatred is a curved blade.  And the harm we do, we do to ourselves. Forgive!   As I once heard an old preacher say, "That'll preach!"

       Lesson #2   Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it.  You're just passing it on to someone else."   The perfect example of that is Jesus the Christ.  He sacrificed his life in order to pass it on to someone else.  Thank you, God, for the life I have in you!

      My wife got me this great book for Christmas by Mitch Albom, author of  Tuesdays with Morrie .  This book is titled  The Five People You Meet in Heaven .  I'm not finished with it yet, but every bit of it has been great so far.  Without giving too much away, Eddie dies and goes to heaven only to meet five people.  The five people are there to give him five lessons that he didn't learn in his life on earth.  For the next couple of times that I put up a new blog I want to share with you the five lessons.  Today is lesson one.  Why do people gather at funerals when others die?  It is because the human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect.  That death doesn't just take someone, it misses someone else, and in the small distance between being taken and being missed, lives are changed. You say you should have died instead of me.  But during my time on earth , people died instead of me, too.  It happens every day.  When lightening strikes a minute after you are gone, or an airplane crashes that you might have been on.  When your colleague falls ill and you do not.  We think such things are random.  But there is a balance to it all.  One withers, another grows.  Birth and death are part of a whole.  It is why we are drawn to babies and to funerals.   Isn't that great?  I get so selfish sometimes, but I have to remember this world doesn't revolve around me.  When something bad happens to me I should be thankful it didn't happen to someone else, but boy that is tough!

      In the Restoration Movement when someone talks about the "plan of salvation" they are speaking code language for our little five finger exercise; 1. hear, 2. believe, 3. repent, 4. confess, and 5. be baptized. Would it surprise you to know that originally there were more than just the five?  The first "so-called" plan of salvation made used by Alexander Campbell and others was 1. faith, 2. repentance, 3. immersion, 4. remission of sins, 5. the gift of the Holy Spirit, and 6. eternal life.  Notice that it looks a little different and it is equally balanced with 3 steps that involve a human response (faith, repentance, immersion) and 3 steps that involve God's involvement (remission of sins, gift of Holy Spirit, eternal life).  By the late 19th Century, epitomized by T.W. Brent's  Gospel Plan of Salvation , God's involvement had been taken out of the plan and the plan then became five human acts rather than 3 human responses and 3 ways God is involved.  I say we put God back in the equation.  Following five steps, much like following a manual, does not mean God must arbitrarily give us some gift.  The plan should focus on all that God has done through Christ's death on the cross and our response to the many, many steps God has made in offering us salvation. What do you think?

      I heard a minister say one time that there are no safe positions when it comes to doctrinal matters.  He used the "women's issue" as an example.  We've got several examples throughout the bible of women having some kind of public role in the church.  For example, 1 Corinthians 11 talks about men and women who are praying and prophesying in the church.  He doesn't stop either one of them, rather he explains how it should be done.  Romans 16 lists a handful of women along with a list of very prominent men saying they were all "servants of the church."  Acts 21:9 talks about Philip, one of the seven appointed as deacons.  It said "he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied."  On the other side of that coin we have Paul writing in 1 Corinthians 14:34, the same book that has women praying and prophesying, that "women should remain silent in the churches."  Also in 1 Timothy 2:12 we have the very same Paul saying that "a woman should learn in quietness and submission... She must be silent." Where is the "safe position?"  If we allow no women to do anything, just to be on the safe side, what if God wanted women to use their gifts and we were denying them that opportunity just to be safe?  What if "being silent" did not mean total silence among all women, but only women who were being unruly and disruptive.  What if in 1 Corinthians 14 Paul is just talking about married women, because he says that if they have a question they should ask their husbands at home.  What about those without a husband?  Are they allowed to speak in church?  Let's look at the other side.  What if we decided the safe thing would be to go ahead and allow women to have a public role in the body, but Paul really meant that no women should say anything?  What if Paul purposely didn't address the silence issue in chapter 11 because he wasn't ready to deal with that yet? I don't mean to make this whole blog a "women's issue" blog.  I just want to show the risk people make by saying, "Lets just play it safe."  Is there really a safe position when it comes to certain doctrinal matters? What do you think?

       When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me."  For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.  Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.  James 1:13-15  Those are strong words from James.  The strongest part of that passage, in my mind, is when he says "sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."  Death!  Sin, once you have lived in it for a while, becomes so numbing to your heart.  You no longer feel its destruction.  You become blind to the damage it causes.  You become apathetic to life, and yes, death appears.  Not only a physical death, but a spiritual death.  This spiritual death is a total separation from God.  According to Dueteronomy 30:20, "For the Lord is your life."  If you are separated from the God then you are separated from your life.  Sin is nasty and dangerous!  Maybe we don't paint sin as ugly as we should.   What do you think?

      Have you ever noticed how weird the Gospel of John is?  I don't mean that in a bad way.  It is a great book... but it is so different from the other three gospel accounts called the Synoptic Gospels.  There are no parables in John.  All through the Synoptics Jesus is healing people and telling them not to tell anyone (scholars call it the Messianic Secret), but in John's gospel he is telling everyone who he is... no secret in John's gospel account (I AM statements are found all throughout John's gospel).  The Synoptics all have a record of Jesus instituting the Lord's Supper.  This isn't found anywhere in John's gospel.  Chronology is also different in John's gospel.  John has the cleansing of the Temple early in Jesus' ministry (John 2:13), but the Synoptics have the cleansing during the last week of Jesus' life here on earth (Matt. 21:12, Mark 11:15, Luke 19:45). Randy Harris, professor at ACU, has called John the  Weirdest Gospel .  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying anything negative about it.  I'm just intrigued by how different it is from the other accounts.  I will be in Nashville all next week from 8:00am until 5:00pm everyday taking a class on the Gospel and Letters of John.  I'm excited.

      My wife and I are going to watch Mel Gibson's new movie that every one is talking about,  The Passion .  I have to be honest with you.  There is a battle going on inside of me just thinking about going to this movie.  I'm questioning myself.  Why do I want to go see this movie?  Why do I want to go see a portrayal of my Lord and Saviour being beaten and nailed to a cross?  I'm scared to think that maybe I am no better than the crowd that gathered to watch the day it happened.  The mob gathered together to initiate a crucifixion and the rest just showed up to see what all the hoopla was about. I would like to think that I am more like Mary or some of his followers that showed up in hopes that maybe it wouldn't happen... maybe he will defeat them all... or maybe at the last minute the "powers that be" would change their minds.  Would Mary want this terrible event to played over and over?  Is not the story itself enough for us to bear... do we have to watch it being played out also? Maybe what I want to see is the empty tomb.  Maybe I want to see death defeated.  Maybe I want to see the hope in the end. Honestly, I don't know why I want to see it.  There is a part of me that says I shouldn't, but I'm going to.  Why?  I don't know yet.  There is a battle taking place inside of me!

      Have you ever noticed how many people in the bible saw Jesus turn water into wine, saw Jesus cast out demons saw Jesus raise the dead saw the many signs and wonders that John said would be too much for his gospel account saw the empty tomb... And yet so many people still rejected him.  The evidence didn't cause them to believe.  The evidence did nothing but harden their hearts even more.  I know some people came to believe in him, but not the majority.  It makes me think today of how many people want proof before they commit to Jesus.  That is why Christian Evidences is so popular.  But is it really doing any good when it comes to changing someone's life?  Maybe I am way off base, but I have come to the conclusion that evidences does little for the unbeliever and it does little good to the believer.  Eyewitnesses to miracles and the empty tomb still did not believ.  Is it taking it too far to say that a believer's desire for more evidence is just  a sign of a weak faith?  Isn't that what faith is... belief when there is no evidence?  Is it still faith when it has been proven to be true without a shadow of a doubt?  I believe true faith comes from the Cross and it's ability to convict me of my sins.  Evidence does little if I don't believe that I am a sinner in need of a Saviour.  That is why the Cross is so vital to Paul's writings.  Everything goes back to the Cross.  I believe that belief and unbelief is the result of the heart, not of the minds ability to understand the evidence.  If the Cross pierces your heart then you are hooked, if not then all the evidence in the world won't turn you to Jesus! What do you think... am I way off?

      In an earlier post I talked about God looking at his creation each day and calling it  good  and then on the last day he looked at everything he had made and called it  very good .  God's creation was created to be good... to be perfect.  But sin entered the world (bad entered a good creation) and we no longer lived as we were intended to live. I am currently reading a new book called  Unveiling Glory: Visions of Christ's Transforming Presence  and it is great.  I found one quote very interesting.  The authors write, "Jesus Christ fleshes out what it means to be created in 'the image' and 'likeness of God' since he is 'the reflection of God's glory and exact imprint of God's being' (Heb. 1:3).  He came not only to save from our sins but also  to show us what it means to be truly human, as humans were intended to be ." The authors go on to say that when we sin we tend to say, "Oh well, I'm only human."  But, in their words, to sin "is to be less than human," because that is not the way we were created.  Christ came to show us what being human truly means... it means going back to creation and being good.  It means being in constant contact with the creator. What do you think?

      Have you ever thought about how quick we are to baptize people?  I'm not against baptizing people.  Please don't think that.  Someone pointed out to me the other day how often people went up to Jesus and said they wanted to follow him.  What was his response?  Jesus said, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head (Luke 9:58)."  Another time he said, "Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot by My disciple," and also, "So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions (Luke 14:27, 33)."  Jesus wanted all people to come to him, but he also wanted them to know the cost.  He wanted them to realize what they were getting into.  He wanted to take a step back and look at it once more before they jump in. I think in the past, if we didn't just dunk them right then and there, we would make people delay their baptism for the wrong reasons.  We felt they should first act like a Christian (quit smoking, quit cursing, etc...) and then we would allow them to become a Christian.  I think that is the wrong reason to delay baptism because only the Spirit can give one the power to do those things and they receive the Spirit at baptism. I do believe that we should ask people to step back and realize the seriousness of following Jesus.  Following Jesus is a commitment for life much like marriage, not a free pass to Heaven.   We shouldn't be scared to let people know beforehand that it will be tough.  It takes sacrifice.  It is not always fun.  But we should also let them know it is worth every bit of our sacrifices because none of them can compares to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross.  What do you think?

      Most scholars today talk about the Kingdom of God as being here  now , but  not yet  fully.  Jesus once told the Pharisees that "the Kingdom of God is among you (Luke 17:21)."  Jesus also said, "But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you (Matt. 12:28)."  Once Jesus came and started his mission, the Kingdom was being established in the  now .  But the Kingdom is  not yet  fully here.  Paul said in Romans 8:23 that "we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies."  The writer of Hebrews writes that "we have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the  age to come  (Hebrews 6:5)."  The fullness of the Kingdom is  not yet  here.   With those thoughts in mind, when Jesus gives us pictures of the Kingdom of God in his parables do you think of the way Heaven will be or the way it should be in the here and now?  I think far too often we look at those parables and think about the future, but I believe Jesus gave us those parables to say this is the way God's people live right now.  This is the way people of the Kingdom live now. In Acts 1:6 the disciples asked Jesus, "Is it at this time You are restoring the Kingdom?"  He said that it wasn't for them to know, but that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them.  In Acts 2 Jews from all over the land came together, the power of the Spirit came upon the disciples, Peter preached a sermon, and about 3,000 were baptized.  It is interesting to note that in the Old Testament all the people came together with one voice and they tried to build a tower to reach God.  He got angry and dispersed them throughout all the land and gave them all different languages.  Now, in Acts 2, they all come together and heard the message of God without confusion.  Could it be that this was the time that the restoration of the Kingdom beginning? When Jesus says, "The Kingdom of God is like..." don't think of the way it will be.  Think of the way it should be now. What do you think?

        Christianity : Most folks think Christianity is an outdated religion. But it turns out it is neither outdated nor a religion.   Jesus : Most folks think of Jesus as the man who started that Christianity religion. But it turns out he wasn't just a man, and he wasn't interested in religion.   Christians : Most folks think Christians are harmless enough, though a bit more boring than most. But it turns out Jesus Followers are by definition neither harmless nor boring.   Repentance : Most folks think repentance is about sitting remorsefully in the corner. But it turns out it's impossible to repent while sitting down.   Church : Most folks think church is an old building with plenty of stained glass and straight wooden pews. But it turns out calling a church a building is like calling a Jesus Follower a two-by-four.   Prayer : Most folks think prayer is the quiet work of barefoot monks with brown hoods in some faraway land. But it turns out prayer has more to do with your own bedroom than with some distant monastery.   The Bible : Most folks insist that the Bible is an outdated old book. But it turns out that usually they've never actually read the thing.   Salvation : Most folks think of salvation as some sort of heavenly retirement package or comprehensive hell-avoidance insurance policy. But it turns out salvation is more like an extravagant banquet that's being served right now.   All of this was taken from  Jesus with Dirty Feet  by Don Everts.

      Richard Foster recently wrote a letter entitled   urlLink A Pastoral Letter  . In it he writes that now is a great moment of opportunity with regards to spiritual formation.  People are eagerly seeking something real that will make a difference in their lives.  He says, "Human need today is so obvious and so great that no honest person can deny it.  People stagger under the burden of human wickedness.  Evil is an open, oozing sore."  People today don't want superficial, half-answers for life's questions anymore.  They won't do anymore.    People don't want answers... They want a transformation.  This is a great time for Spiritual Formation.  In Foster's letter he gives suggestions for several areas that need to be focused on when dealing with Spiritual Formation.  1) Focus on Jesus. Foster writes, "Nothing is more important in Christian Spiritual Formation than our need to continue ever focused upon Jesus. This is not formation-in-general. This is formation into Christlikeness.  We should be constantly learning to live our life as Jesus would live our life if he were we."  2)Focus on Scripture. Foster writes, "We can begin with the Gospels looking at the “with-God” life that is fully portrayed in Jesus. And we seek this life abundant that comes in and through Jesus alone. We study the Epistles to see the life of God being poured through his people, the Church. And we seek that life for ourselves and for our families and for our churches and for our times. We study the Psalms and see the people of God at prayer. And we too enter a living experience of prayer, working in co-operation with God to see his kingdom come and his will be done here on earth. We study the Pentateuch to understand the Mosaic Law in the light of grace. And we seek to conform our lives to the heart and spirit of the Law. We study the Historical books to understand how God works through the historical particularities of a people. And we ask for God’s life and God’s work in the specifics of our histories. We study the Prophets and see their bias in favor of the downtrodden. And we seek the power to live continually with a sensitized social conscience. We study the Wisdom books and discover God’s interest in the practical details of everyday life. And we pray for wisdom in the minutiae of our little life. We study the Eschatological books and discover that “He’s got the whole world in his hands”. And we place our little destiny in God’s hands too. And more."  3)Focus on Spiritual Disciplines. Foster writes, "There is a process, a God-ordained means, to becoming the kind of persons and the kind of communities that can fully and joyfully enter into such abundant living. This is the reason for the Disciplines of the spiritual life. They constitute the way God has given us for intentionally “training ourselves in godliness” (1 Tim. 4:7). This is why the Spiritual Disciplines is the third essential focus of Spiritual Formation. Frankly, no Spiritual Disciplines, no Spiritual Formation."  I've given you bits and pieces of his letter.

       The Prayer of Abandonment  by Charles de Foucauld  My Father, I abandon myself to you. Make of me what you will. Whatever you make of me, I thank you. I am ready for everything I accept everything. Provided that your will be done in me, In all your creatures, I desire nothing else, Lord. I put my soul in your hands,  I give it to you, Lord, With all the love in my heart, Because I love you, And because it is for me a need of love To give myself, To put myself in your hands unreservedly, With infinite trust. For you are my Father!

      One of the speakers at Tulsa talked about encouraging others.  He talked about the golden rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."  He made the point that when it comes to encouraging others that the golden rule is probably not the best rule to go by.  People don't like the same type of encouragement I like.  They may not need the same kind of encouragement I like.  It may not be encouraging at all to try to  encourage them in the way I would like.  Ephesians 4:29 gives us a better rule to go by when trying to encourage others.  Paul writes,  "Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up  according to their needs , that it may benefit those who listen."   Everyone has different needs and they need to be encouraged in different ways.  For so long I believe we have put people in a box and tried to encourage everyone the same way, not realizing that each person has a different need.  Lets start building people up according to their needs.

      I just got back from the Tulsa Workshop.  It was great!  I was encouraged by all the singing, the prayers, and the speakers.  It lit a fire in me that I hope doesn't fade away too soon.  I'm always scared of those "mountain top experiences" because it never seems to take it too long to fade away when you get back home.  I heard some great sermons and classes from Jim McGuiggan, Rick Atchley, Mike Cope, Jeff Walling, Wade Hodges, Terry Rush, Marvin Phillips, Roger Dickson, Victor Knowles, Chris Seidman, and many many more.  God has blessed them with the ability to touch lives.  It was awesome.  I'm already pumped and ready to go next year.

      Healthy Communities create Healthy Individuals.  I like that!  David Bland writes an article in the book,  Preaching Romans , it says, "Today, a therapeutic mindset emphasizing individual needs over community values drives much of our culture."  He goes on to write, "A therapeutic culture believes that individuals possess within themselves all the resources necessary to heal their psychological and emotional infirmities.  One needs little assistance from outside sources, let alone God.  Individuals devote their energy to finding the available means within to gain relief from tension, emotional discomfort, and frustration.  Little interest or energy remains for obligations to others."  It has been said by James Thompson that one of preaching's primary focus is to create a community that reflects the image of God.  I've never paid much attention to this, but Paul hardly ever focuses his writings on individual formation, but rather on community formation.  "The tragedy," Bland writes, "is that the Christian church often merely mirrors the surrounding culture rather than offering itself as an alternative community.  In order to address the needs of the individual, churches adopt a therapeutic mindset, which leads them to see their primary purpose as providing individuals relief from the anxieties of life."  Maybe we have looked at things backwards for too long.  We have adopted the idea that creating healthy individuals will create a healthy community.  I get the impression that Paul sees it the opposite way.  He would say that if you create a healthy community then you will in turn have healthy individuals.  Learning to be a Christian is a communal journey, not an individual experiential event.

      I'm staying pretty busy these days so instead of giving some random thought today I thought I would share with you what is going on in my life right now. * I'm taking a Greek class every Tuesday night at Lipscomb University which is wearing me down.   * I just finished a one week intensive class at Lipscomb last week.  The subject was the gospel and letters of John.  It was really good.  Now I have to take a final and start working on a 15 page paper on John's theology of the Holy Spirit. * I teach an adult class every Sunday morning right now and we are almost finished with 1 Corinthians.  It has been a great study. * Me and another guy at church has started teaching a new series on Wednesday nights called Paradoxes of the Bible. * I have been preaching more lately and have really enjoyed it.  I would like to work on my preaching so I am currently reading a book called  Preaching Romans  which was based off the sermon seminar at Rochester Christian College.  Looking for more books if anyone knows of any.  I will also be attending Lipscomb's sermon seminar in May. * In a few weeks I will be heading to Tulsa for the  urlLink Tulsa Workshop .  I'm really excited about that. * I'm gonna try to spend the next few weeks reading through Mark's gospel account a of couple of times. * I've also got a lot of office (busy work) to do.  I really feel I have been blessed with the job I have.  Don't take any of this as complaining.  I love doing the things I mentioned.  I know others don't have it as well as I do.  God has been good to me.  I'm sure there is more I write about but no one really reads this thing anyway!

      I saw Mel Gibson's movie last night.  I don't want to say it was good, because who wants to say they enjoyed watching a movie about their Messiah being crucified?  But, I will say it was a good experience.  It gave me a lot of things to think about and it has opened up some conversations with others who have seen it.  I've heard too many people nit pick at little things they thought "didn't really happen" and shouldn't have been in the movie, so I'm not going to go down that road.  I will share with you what stood out the most to me throughout the whole movie.  I never truly thought about the tension between Jesus' humanity and his divinity.  Mel brought that out very well throughout the movie.  That constant picture of Satan appearing throughout the whole movie really spoke to me.  We will never be able to understand this, but Jesus was  all  man and  all  God at the same time.  There was a part of Jesus that wanted to get out of that whole mess.  He prayed for a way out.  He could have called 10,000 angels at any moment and the human in him wanted to do that so badly.  It didn't help any that Satan was right there tempting him to do it.  But, Jesus, being all God, wanted to go through with this.  He wanted to follow through with his Father's will.  He knew it was the only way so he couldn't command the angels to come to his aid.  He had to do this all by himself.  That tension was there and Mel did a good job of portraying that tension.

      Someone once speaking of the postmodern era said, "For the premoderns scripture was THE truth.  For the moderns science was THE truth.  But for the postmoderns there are MANY truths." Now, how do we preach John 14:6 to this postmodern world?  Jesus said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me."  How do we get the postmoderns to understand that and accept it?  Some say we just preach and if they don't get it then they just don't get it... not our fault.  But, I don't want to settle for that answer.  I want to connect the Gospel with the postmoderns.  Has anyone figured out how to do that yet?

      When I think of a "restoration movement" I think of something that is constantly changing.  Restoration is an ongoing process.  To be part of the restoration movement, in the Biblical sense, is to constantly be in the Bible constantly restoring ourselves to be the people God wants us to be.  The mistake our movement made many years ago was to think that we had arrived.  Somewhere along the line we believed that we had restored what needed to be restored and we became a "maintaining movement" rather than a "restoration movement."  That is why there are so many journals and preachers out there that talk about the sin of change.  That is why there are so many other preachers being labeled "change agents."  Somewhere we quit restoring and started maintaining.  No change is allowed anymore... don't even think about change.  Now, we sit in our church buildings and pray this familiar prayer,  "I thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like everyone else, especially like that tax collector over there! For I never cheat, I don't sin, I don't commit adultery, I fast twice a week, and I give you a tenth of my income."   The sad thing about that prayer is that the one praying probably didn't cheat or commit adultery.  And he probably did fast twice a week and give a tenth of his income.  It wasn't that he lied, he was telling the truth, but pride got in the way and Jesus said he didn't go away justified.  Lets reword this prayer to fit our situation today.  Is this a familiar prayer to you?   "I thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like everyone else, especially like that Baptist over there! For I never use instrumental music, I don't sin, I don't tell people to pray God into their hearts, I take the Lord's Supper every week, and I have the right name on our building."  Lets swallow our pride and admit that we could be wrong about some things.  And even if we are right about most things, does that give us the right to label people and distance ourselves from others?  What do you think?

      I've been thinking a lot about "silence" in the Bible.  Most of the more conservative churches of Christ claim that there is a "law of silence."  Others in the more progressive churches of Christ say there is a "principle of silence."  There is, and always will, be disagreements between the two.  These disagreements are so strong that people get written up in journals, churches split, and I believe God is saddened.  The "law of silence" refers to the idea that whatever God is silent about in the Bible is prohibited by the fact of that silence.  The "principle of silence" refers to the silence of God being respected but not always being prohibitive.  Those following the "principle of silence" believe silence should be studied and examined before making a judgment.  It could be permissive or prohibitive. These two thoughts all stems from Thomas Campbell's statement made in a sermon.  He said, "WHERE THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK, WE SPEAK; AND WHERE THE SCRIPTURES ARE SILENT, WE ARE SILENT." It is interesting to note that Campbell would have leaned more toward the progressive thought of silence.  A colleague of Campbell wrote about this statement in a book saying,  "There should be no contention, henceforth, in regard to the opinions of men, however wise or learned. Whatever private opinions might be entertained upon matters not clearly revealed  must be retained in silence , and  no effort must be made to impose them upon others . Thus the silence of the Bible was to be respected equally with its revelations."   This was a common sentiment among Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, and Barton W. Stone.  If one studies them closely you will find that they believed it is wrong to say  "God said,"  if God has not actually said it.  Olan Hicks wrote, "If the Bible is truly silent on a matter, making a law on it would be wrong by the very nature of the case." The very idea of a "law of silence" is made up from silence so wouldn't that be speaking where the Bible is not speaking?   Please understand I am not on a mission to change "church" or to advocate insturmental music.  I'm just saying we need to quit being so quick to judge those who differ with us on things not specifically stated in the Bible.  God is silent on things, maybe we should be too.  What do you think?

       The Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words and honor Me with their lip service, but they remove their hearts far from Me, and their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote, Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish."   Isaiah 29:13-14  The Greek version of this passage says, "Their worship is a farce, for they merely teach human commands and teachings."  This serves as a great warning to all those who hold too closely to traditionalism.  The only problem is that no one can agree on what is tradition and what is bible.  After believing something for so long it becomes part of the bible to a lot of people.  I'm not pointing any fingers though.  I'm sure I have fallen, and will continue to fall, guilty of following a tradition over the bible at times.  I think it is important to always be willing to question things.  You are not sinning because you want to question a belief and dig into the text to find the answer.  We have become too scared to even question a practice in our churches today for fear being labeled conservative or liberal.  Well, I could care less if I am considered conservative or liberal by someone as long as I am right with God.  What do you think?

       In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  He was with God in the beginning.   John 1:1-2   In the past God spoke to our ancestros through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us through his Son.   Hebrews 1:1-2  Hmmmmm... I wonder what God's message is to us today?  Jesus is God's message!

      The elder, John, wrote a letter to his dear friend, Gaius.  We know this letter as 3 John.  John loved his friend dearly.  He wished only the best for him.  This is how he opens his letter,  "Dear friend, I am praying that all is well with you and that your body is as healthy as I know your soul is."   Wow, what a prayer!  I would be scared to have someone pray that for me.  I don't know about you, but my physical health is usually better than my spiritual health.  But John says, "I want you to be as physically healthy as you are spiritually healthy!"  Gaius must have been in a great relationship with the Lord.  Most of us should probably be praying that our spiritual health become as healthy as our physical health before we put that prayer the other way!

      I was taught at an early age that John 4:24 meant that we must have a perfect balance of spirit (emotions) and truth (right doctrine) in order to worship properly.  After years of reading this passage and its context, I have to come to another conclusion as to what Jesus is telling the Samaritan woman.  We can't separate this one scripture from the context surrounding it.  Jesus and the woman seem to be having some kind of religious debate.  She wants to know where true worship takes place.  She says to Jesus, "Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is Jerusalem."  Where are we supposed to worship, Jesus?  Jesus' response is interesting because not only does he try to answer that question but he also says that they don't know what they worship either. So what Jesus deals with is 1) where do we worship and 2)what do we worship.  Jesus tells the woman that God is Spirit.  He isn't confined to some place.  He is everywhere.  Worship won't be confined to any place because as the Spirit lives in us we will be able to worship Him anywhere and everywhere!  That is worshiping in Spirit.  It is a life that lives in worship to God. As for worshiping in truth.  In John 14:6 Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life."  The word "truth" appears many, many times in John's gospel and almost everytime it is somehow related to Jesus.  Worshiping in truth is worshiping in or through Jesus.  It is following him as he calls us to do.  He was being rejected as the truth by, not only the Jews, but by the Samaritans.  He says you have to receive me because I am the truth. So, my conclusion is that John 4:24 is not dealing with emotions and right doctrine, but it is dealing with where and what (or who).  What do you think?

      Are we ready?  I was griping the other day about how white, upper-middle class the church I currently work for is.  Everyone looks the same.  There is no diversity.  As I was griping about that someone asked me, "Are we ready to handle diversity?"  It is a good question for all churches to ask.  In my situation are we ready, spiritually, to have financially poor people and deal with the problems that they deal with everyday.  Are we ready to handle to problems associated with reaching out to those struggling with drugs and alcohol.  Better yet, are we ready, or equipped, to handle reaching out to those struggling with homosexuality.  Is an all white church ready to have a group of black people in our services, and vice versa.  What about foreigners who have trouble speaking English?  Can we deal with that? Are we ready?  It is a great question.  Maybe instead of asking this to individuals we should be asking this in our bible classes and from the pulpit.  We preach about evangelism and reaching out all the time, but when it comes down to it we are scared of those different than us so we end up reaching out to those who look like us.  Are we up to the task?  I believe with the Spirit moving us and giving strength we are up to the task.

      Grandmothers are great. My grandmother was supposed to be coming to visit me this weekend and hear me preach.  I had arranged it so that my scheduled time to preach would coincide with her trip.  Well, tragedy hit!  My grandmother had to have quadruple bypass surgery yesterday morning.  Obviously that changed her plans and she won't be in Bowling Green this weekend.  I've been visiting her in the hospital while she recovers.  She has really been a trooper!  While she was still drugged and waking from her surgery the nurses were telling her all the things she could do when she gets her strength back.  Everything they told her she could do she resonded with a "No!"  Finally she said, in her drugged state, "Gotta hear my grandson preach!"  I love my grandmother. I nominate today as Hug a Grandmother Day.

       "Nobody except the preacher comes to church desperately anxious to discover what happened to the Jebusites."  - Harry Emerson Fosdick Sometimes we (the ministers) get lost in all the little details and greek words.  I have found in most cases this quote is right on target.  I heard a lady in our congregation tell a minister, "No one cares how smart you are!"  Obviously she wasn't talking to me because I'm not smart enough to try to impress anyone, but one day when I am smart I will have to remember what she said. By the way, what did happen to the Jebusites?

Well, in the process of doing that I lost everything again.  I finally gave up and changed the design altogether.  Patience was not one of my virtues this weekend.

       The Message from GOD to Jeremiah: "Stand in the gate of GOD's Temple and preach this Message. "Say, 'Listen, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship GOD. GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies, Israel's God, has this to say to you: Clean up your act--the way you live, the things you do--so I can make my home with you in this place. Don't for a minute believe the lies being spoken here--"This is GOD's Temple, GOD's Temple, GOD's Temple!" Total nonsense! Only if you clean up your act (the way you live, the things you do), only if you do a total spring cleaning on the way you live and treat your neighbors, only if you quit exploiting the street people and orphans and widows, no longer taking advantage of innocent people on this very site and no longer destroying your souls by using this Temple as a front for other gods-- only then will I move into your neighborhood. Only then will this country I gave your ancestors be my permanent home, my Temple.  Get smart! Your leaders are handing you a pack of lies, and you're swallowing them! Use your heads! Do you think you can rob and murder, have sex with the neighborhood wives, tell lies nonstop, worship the local gods, and buy every novel religious commodity on the market-and then march into this Temple, set apart for my worship, and say, "We're safe!" thinking that the place itself gives you a license to go on with all this outrageous sacrilege? A cave full of criminals! Do you think you can turn this Temple, set apart for my worship, into something like that? Well, think again. I've got eyes in my head. I can see what's going on."  Jeremiah 7:1-11 MSG  See any lessons any there for us today?

      Next week I will be attending Lipscomb's annual Hazelip Preaching Seminar.  The theme of this year's seminar is  Preaching in a New World .  I'm excited about attending this seminar because there are some great speakers that will be there and I would like to become a better preacher. We are living in a new world.  The church doesn't want to admit it, but we are.  Thirty years ago a preacher could assume that almost everyone in the pews knew the stories of the Bible.  Even if they didn't attend church regularly they knew about Noah, David and Goliath, and Jesus.  You didn't have to tell those stories.  You could just mention them and move on.  It was a "churched" society. Well, you can't assume that anymore.  We don't live in a "churched" society anymore.  You may lose a third, or more, of your congregation if you say, "Now, we all know about what happened to so and so in the Parable of so and so."  No!  Not everyone knows what happened.  They don't even know what a parable is.  Preachers could get away without telling the story in the past, but now we have to tell the story.  We have to tell all the stories!  This is something I have to remind myself every time I prepare for a sermon.  I have to assume the listeners don't know the story. Preachers have to learn how to preach in the new world.  Those that don't will get left behind along with the churches they preach in.

      Ghandi quoted Christ often but never claimed to be a Christian.  When asked why he wasn't a Christian his response was that he accepted and loved our Christ, but his followers don't look anything like him. Man, that stings!    Father, I pray that you will mold me and make look more and more like the Son everyday.  I pray that my life will preach a message that says I belong to you.  Make me a servant.  Make me like you.  Amen.

       You can tell how popular a church is by who comes on Sunday morning.   You can tell how popular the pastor or evangelist is by who comes on Sunday night.   But you can tell how popular Jesus is by who comes to the prayer meeting.   That quote was taken from Jim Cymbala's  Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire .  It is an excellent book about prayer.   Greenwood Park had a prayer meeting last.  I won't tell you how popular Jesus is, but I will say that I really feel refreshed after our prayer meetings.  We sing song, read lots of scripture, and have lots of prayers all focused on a particular theme that had been decided beforehand.  I have a great helper who would like to go unnamed, but she actually does all of the work.  I just make sure it runs smoothly. Prayer is such a blessing!  In college our campus ministry sang a wonderful song.  Here are the words:  Oh Lord, listen to you children praying Oh Lord, send your spirit to this place Oh Lord, listen to your children praying Send us love.  Send us power.  Send us grace.

      Paul tells the Galatian church that  "if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently.  But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted (6:1)."   The first thing we notice is that people should be dealt with gently.  That is a fruit of the Spirit and is a sign of a true believer.  The second thing we notice is the one is doing the restoring should watch themselves because they may also be tempted.  What is the temptation they may face?  I believe it is the temptation of self righteousness.  I don't think the temptation is that they may fall into the same sin as the other, but that they may think of themselves as more righteous and godly because they are restoring the one who is less righteous.  That is a dangerous attitude to have.  Remember, it is to be done gently.  Some version say "with meekness."  One scholar noted, "Paul seems keenly aware that a self-righteous posture of prosecutors can cause greater damage to the community than the offense done by a wrongdoer."  I think that is so true.  I have often found unbelievers saying that the reason they don't believe is because Christians fuss and fight all the time, thinking one is more righteous than the other.   Listen to Jesus in John 17:20-23,  "My prayer is not for them alone.  I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.  May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.  I have given them the glory that you gave me - so that they may be one as we are one - I in them and you in me - so that they may be brought to complete unity.  Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me."

      I found this quote on Mike Cope's blog page:  It is the height of arrogance (often fueled by fear) to believe that WE got it right and in order to follow him you must follow US.  So often we fall into the trap of preaching our particular brand of church rather than Jesus.  We say, "Either do church my way or its the highway!"  It is so arrogant to think we have it all figured out and then sit back and say, "Why can't they figure it out?"

      As Hosea is declaring a message from God to His people he speaks of the lack of faithfulness, love, and acknowledgement of God in the land.  He isn't just speaking to common lay people of the land but to the priest.  He says,  "The more the priests increased, the more they sinned against me (4:7)."   As you read further in chapter 4 you will come across an interesting statement.  Hosea says,  "They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth,  where the shade is pleasant ."   Did you catch that last phrase?   Where the shade is pleasant!   They had exchanged God for comfort.  I believe we have all fallen into that trap at times.  Are you too comfortable with your Christianity right now?  I heard someone once say that Christianity is meant to be uncomfortable because it is contrary to our nature.  Lets quit gathering where the shade is pleasant.  What do you think?

I've been asked, "What do you do all day, just associate with others?" Well, now you can try to find all new jokes because as of last night's elders meeting I am officially titled Involvment Minister! I know, I know, I know!

      I'm currently writing a book review on Paul J. Achtemeier's book,  Inspiration and Authority .  It is a very thought provoking book on the inspiration of scripture.  Here is a question to ponder.  How is the Bible inspired?   Do you believe it is the authors of the biblical books that are inspired?   Do you think that it is not so much the authors, but rather the words that they wrote that are inspired?   Or do you think it is the thoughts they were trying to convey that are inspired?  This is just a little sample of the questions he tries to tackle thoughout the book.  If you care about scholarly jargon then you should pick this book up and see what you think about his thoughts.

      It is hard as a minister who is trained in biblical studies to hear bad theology come from the pulpit when a member is leading devotional thoughts or communion thoughts.  Please don't think I am being so arrogant as to say that I know it all.  I don't!  I believe that I know enough to get me in trouble, hahaha. Anyway, back to the bad theology from the pulpit.  I have heard a man on a number of occasions say the same thing as he gets the opportunity to give the communion thoughts before our Lord's Supper.  He gets up behind the pulpit and says,  "There aren't many things during our worship service that you can do just between you and God.  We sing together, pray together, and study the Bible together.  But the Lord's Supper is the only thing we can do that is just between you and God."   Uhhhhhh, hello.  Does anyone else hear what is wrong with that comment?  The Lord's Supper is a time of communion with the body as a whole.  It is meant to be shared with each other.  Isn't that what Paul was so furious about in 1 Corinthians?  They weren't sharing, or communing, with each other.  Some were being left out.  The whole problem was that they were keeping it to themselves and not doing it with the whole body.  No, the Lord's Supper isn't just between you and God.  It is for all of us to take part in together.  I can handle the way we do it on Sunday mornings, although I don't like it, but at least we all do it together at the same time.  Sunday nights really bother me though.  Only a handful of people take it while the rest of us just sit around and wait.  Or, as some churches do, they send the one's who didn't take it that morning to another room in the church building so they can get the opportunity.  Some partake of it while others don't.... hmmmmm... Doesn't that sound like Paul's argument in 1 Corinthians? The funny thing about this whole post is that I haven't heard this guy make that comment in about a month or more, but for some reason I was thinking about it this morning so I thought I would share my thoughts with the few people who read this thing. My point is this.  The Lord Supper is a time to break bread with your brother and sister in the Lord.  It is not a time to put on your blinders so that you won't be distracted as you see the person next to you.  It is not a time to all of sudden distance yourself from the body of Christ around you so that you can sit in a somber and meditative state.  It is communion.  It is fellowship.  It is breaking bread with your family as you all remember the Lord.

      Last night we had a great time of worship.  I was in charge and I did things a little different.  We sang traditional hymns and we sang the contemporary praise songs.  I asked about 4 different song leaders to pick two or three of their favorite songs and then talk about why they mean so much to them.  I opened the service with a funny email about the difference between praise songs and traditional hymns.  The point of the email was that both songs have the same message but because of the difference in style we forget that both are giving the same message.  We look at the style and say,  "Why can't we get away from those archaic oldies.  I don't understand them."   Or we say on the other end,  "All these kids want to do is sing upbeat happy clappy songs that have no depth."   My point was that we need to try to understand each other better rather than argue over the style of singing because we are both doing the same thing in our own ways.  We are praising the Living God!  I had a lot of good comments which was encouraging to me. Later, I heard that someone had gotten up and left.  I was told that this person made the comment that we shouldn't have to pick between the two, we should just sing the ones we have always sung for years.  Well, wasn't that my point?  We shouldn't have to pick.  We should learn to understand each other and appreciate both!  As he was leaving someone asked him, "Whats easier; to leave or to find a reason to stay?"  He just turned and walked out.  Honestly, I was frustrated, but I don't hold anything against him.  We all take the easy way out of things at times.  I do it too.  If I expect more out of him then I should expect more out of myself in similar situations.  In difficult situations we should all ask ourselves, "What would be the easy thing?"  And then we should do the opposite because it is probably the right thing.

      Did you know that the one of the most repeated commands in the Bible is do not fear?  It is not always in that wording.  Sometimes it is "fear not," or "be strong and couragous."  However it is worded one of the most repeated commands deals with not being afraid. I believe that I let fear determine my words and actions a lot of times.  I don't tell the church what I really think it should be doing because my views go against tradition and I'm worried I will get chewed out by some old man who thinks I am a flaming liberal.  I don't raise my hands or clap when I really feel like doing it because I'm afraid of the repercusions.  I don't think that I am alone though.  I'm guessing that is a struggle a lot of ministers have.  We've got to quit letting fear guide us and start letting the Spirit guide us.  We have to quit being afraid and start being strong and couragous.  I admire people who are bold and say what is on their minds.  I've heard ministers say things and, as I am getting ready to dodge all of the stones, I'm wishing that I could have been bold enough to say those things. I need to take a lesson from the story of Joshua as the Lord says to him,  "Be strong and couragous.  Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."

      My wife will be home tonight!  Hip Hip Hooray!  She has been gone for one whole week on a mission trip in Honduras.  I've missed her a lot, especially at 6:00am every morning when our puppy decides it is time to wake everyone up so that he can be let out of his crate.  She is always the better person and wakes up to let him out so that I can sleep a little longer.  There are many, many, many other reasons why I miss her but that is a pretty good one right there. I can't wait to see how this trip has changed her.  I'm not saying she needs to change, but I always go on trips while she stays at home.  I always come home and talk her ear off about all the things I learned or experienced and I am a different person for about a week, and then I get back into my normal routine.  Now, it is her turn to come home and talk my ear off.  I want to hear about her experience and the things she learned, and I want to see the change this trip made in her life. I love her and can't wait to see her.   Everybody, go hug your spouse!

      I've been preparing a lesson that I will be preaching in Louisville, KY this Saturday.  I have been invited to speak at an event there called Churchfest.  Man, they sure don't know what they are setting themselves up for by inviting me, hahaha.  They must have been scraping the bottom of the barrell to find my name.  I'm really looking forward to it.  The theme is  Our Echo Will Be Heard .  One speaker will speaking on the theme of The Echo of Our Voices and I will be speaking on the Echo of Our Lives.  My message will come down to this point:   You preach and live a message with your life whether you want to or not!  Today, professional athletes and entertainers say not to look at them as role models.  The problem with that mentality is that they are going to be looked at as role models whether they want to or not.  Whether positively or negatively people will be influenced by their lives.  The same goes for all of us.  We can't avoid having others see the lives we live.  We are all going to preach a message with the way we live our lives.  The question is, "What message does your life preach?"

      Here is another great quote to chew on.   The deepest level of communication is not communication but communion.  It is wordless.  It is beyond words and beyond speech, and it is beyond concept.  Not that we discover a new unity.  We discover an older unity.  We are already one, but we imagine that we are not.  And what we have to recover is our original unity.  What we have to be is what we are.  Thomas Merton  ______________________________________________________________

      Well, for those of you who aren't familiar with the Stone/Campbell Movement here is a little bit of info.  The founders of the movement never thought they were restoring THE church.  If you look at their writings and pay close attention to their language they often said things like "restore to the church" the things which they thought had been lost throughout the ages.  Their plan was never to start a new church, but rather to help reform the churches already in existence.  But, in my opinion, even that wasn't their ultimate goal.  Their ultimate goal was unity.  Barton W. Stone once said,  "Let Christian unity be our polar star."   They speak of uniting Christian among all denominations.  The Stone/Campbell Movement was an ecumenical movement.  That is why I chose the quote for yesterday's blog.  Isaac Errett was saying that if Christian unity is  "our polar star"  then we have a lot of work to do because we can't even get along in our own little family of Christianity.  The Stone/Campbell Movement, a unity movement, has created three main churches (Disciples of Christ, Independent Christian Churches, and Churches of Christ) and within those three branches are all sorts of subdivisions (NI's, One Cups, etc...).  I believe unity, like Jesus prayed for in John 17, is a great goal.  Jesus prayed for it!  We have a lot of work to do.  Maybe we should follow Stone's advice when he wrote,  "We will, that preachers and people, cultivate a spirit of mutual forbearance; pray more and dispute less."

      Chew on this quote from an early restorationist.  I may comment on it tomorrow.   If a people pleading for the union of all Christians can not maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace in their own limited communion, and peaceably dispose of all such questions as are mentioned above [instrumental music in worship and a developing pastor system], and a great many more, then is this plea for union as ridiculous a farce as was ever played before the public.  The Apostolic churches had much graver errors in doctrine and practice to dispose of than any that are troubling us; and many had a strong propensity to file off into parties.  The lessons are Christian liberty, of tolerance and forbearance, of patience and gentleness taught by the apostles, need to be carefully attended to.  No one should allow himself to indulge such fears or to utter them.  As long as we are one in the faith of Christ and in acknowledging the supremacy of His authority, we will remain one people; and free and kindly discussion will bring us out of all our differences.  Isaac Errett,  Christian Standard  (July 3, 1869)

      I'm a big fan of Sienfeld.&nbsp; I love the show.&nbsp; There is one episode that deals with having a mentor.&nbsp; I believe it is Jerry's girlfriend who has a mentor and she can't live without one.&nbsp; I think it is good for all of us to have someone we look up to.&nbsp; My mentor is Mike Stroud.&nbsp; He has been the campus minister at Middle Tennessee State University for over 15 yrs.&nbsp; I didn't do an internship under him, but I felt that my time there as a student was my internship.&nbsp; He took me, as well as some other students, under his wing and discipled us.&nbsp; He walked us through ministry and life.&nbsp; He took three guys (me and two others) and called us his Timothy Project.&nbsp; He was our Paul.&nbsp; I loved it and I love Mike for all that he has done.&nbsp; I've told people that he is the best kept secret in campus ministry.&nbsp; Well, now he is starting a new chapter in his life.&nbsp; Mike will be leaving the the confines of the student center and moving all the way over to west coast.&nbsp; He has taken on the role of Discipleship Minister for a church in Oregon.&nbsp; It is hard to see your mentor move so far away but I'm excited about this new adventure in his life.&nbsp; I got to see him last night and tell him I love him.&nbsp; We hugged and said our farewells until we meet again.&nbsp; See ya Mike!

      Sorry I've been a slacker lately.&nbsp; This summer has been a hectic one and it will continue to be for the next few months.&nbsp; I've been in weddings, gone to camp for a week, just got back from my parents house in Eufaula, Alabama for a week, next week I will be heading to Chicago with my wife for a few days, the weekend after that we will be chaperoning the youth group white water rafting trip, and more to come after that.&nbsp; I'm not complaining.&nbsp; It has all been great.&nbsp; It just doesn't give me the time to post my thoughts as often as I would like.&nbsp; I'll catch up real soon.

      People usually get a good laugh at me when we go to eat at Pizza Hut for the lunch buffet.  I always get me a plate full of pizza and bread sticks.  I then go back for seconds or thirds.  Then I get a plate of cinnamon sticks.  Finally, my last thing before I am done is fix me a big salad.  Yep, I eat my salad last at Pizza Hut.  I don't know why.  It is just what I do. After looking over my life Pizza Hut isn't the only place I do things backwards.  Here is a list, in the order I have taken them, of the classes I have had at Lipscomb during my Masters program: Luke/Acts Intro to Interpretation Biblical Tools and Research Intro to Hebrew Jeremiah/Lamentations New Testament Theology Corinthians Deuteronomy Intro to Greek Johanine Literature Restoration Movement And, after all of that I am currently taking Critical Intro to the Bible.  If anyone knows anything about graduate studies in Bible then you know that Critical Intro to the Bible is one of the very fist classes you take.  I've only got to take two more classes before I finish this program and I am just now getting to Critical Intro.  I guess I like doing things backwards.

      I haven't read the book yet, but Ravi Zacharias has written a book titled  Recapture the Wonder .  I've wanted to read it but haven't gotten around to purchasing it yet.  His title captures my experience this past Thursday night.  I was at camp and at camp we always have a devo under the stars on Thursday.  While we sang I just laid my head back and watched the stars in the night sky.  I used to do that all the time but it has been a while since the last time.  As I stared at the stars it hit me, "This is the same night sky that Moses stood under as he led God's chosen people out of Egypt.  This is the same night sky that David watched as he was hiding from Saul in the desert.  This is the same night sky that covered Peter as he warmed himself by the fire the night he denied Christ.  This is the same night sky that God created in Genesis 1.  This is awesome!"  I recaptured the wonder.  Lets just hope that feeling stays around for a while.

      I heard a phrase yesterday that I really liked while I was talking with another minister. The phrase is  layers of permission . We were talking about church involvement, or lack of, from members of just about any congregation you attend. He felt that one reason for the lack of involvement is what he termed  layers of permission . Here is what he means: a new member gets passionate about an area of ministry and would like to plan an activity, this new member finds out there is already an organized ministry that would help with this activity at the church, this new member then finds out that before that organized ministry can do anything they must first run it by the deacon in charge of that ministry, but that deacon must first run it by the elders, the elders discuss it later that week in an elders meeting and get back with the deacon, who then gets back with the organized ministry, who then finally gets back to the new member only to find out that the new member had given up on the idea because it took so long to get an answer. Did you see all the  layers of permission  in that scenario? We have got to get away from a ministry that is built on layers, or hierarchal structures. We have got to be in the business of  empowering the church . We, as so-called leaders, need to feed off of our members passion to serve, especially our new members. Could it be that members who don't serve are not just lazy, but rather we (paid ministers, elders, and deacons) have squashed their passion to serve? We have got to back up what we say from the pulpit when we tell our congregations that WE are all ministers. When someone has to go through  layers of permission  to do something we don't make them feel much like a minister! OK, enough grumbling from me. What do you think?

      I just finished reading  A New Kind of Christian .  It was a good book.  It made me uncomfortable, but I liked it.  I didn't agree with everything that it said, but I liked it.  You should definitely pick up and read it yourself.  Here are some quotes on "church" from the book in the last chapter:   The church doesn't exist for the benefit of its members.  It exists to equip its members for the benefit of the world.      Jesus said it: "As the Father has sent me, so I send you"- which means we are sent not to "be served" but to "serve", and that we are sent not to "the healthy" but to the "sick".      Our mission is simply seeking, receiving, and manifesting the kingdom of God, the reign of God, the reality of God's will being done on earth as it is in heaven.  In that mission, the church is the catalyst, not the goal...      Our mission is comprehensive - so that every Christian, "clergy" and "lay", is equally sent - to a classroom, a factory, an office building, a highway, a jungle, whatever - to be an agent of Christ, an agent of the kingdom.      We don't recruit people to be customers of our products or consumers of our religious programs; we recruit them to be colleagues in our mission.  The church doesn't exist to satisfy the consumer demands of believers; the church exists to equip and mobilize men and women for God's mission in the world.

      I have taken an idea from a few other fellow bloggers who have no shame.  Well, I have no shame either.  Under my Random Sites section of links I have added my wishlist of books.  Feel free to check them out and buy me one or two, hahaha!

      I've had people tell me for a while that I need to read  A New Kind of Christian .  Well, I have finally picked it up and started reading it.  I have loved it so far.  I don't know what to do with it, but I love it.  If you haven't read the book then you won't connect with my next statement, but for those who have read it then you will know what I mean.  I find myself connecting with Dan more and more as I read through the book.  Especially the chapter where he just snapped while taking a nature walk with Neo.  That was me... I wanted to snap.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the book and then I am just going to have to take a long time to dwell on the message.  For those who have read it, what did you think about the book?

      Leo Tolstoy once said,  "Everybody thinks of changing humanity and nobody thinks of changing himself."  I think that is especially true of ministers. I just finished reading a book entitled  A Little Excercise for Young Theologians  and it has been great. One of the great mistakes that the author warns of is the mistake of reading the Bible with others in mind, but never with yourself in mind. This is what he writes:   "The man who studies theology, and especially he who studies dogmatics, might watch carefully whether he increasingly does not think in the third rather than in the second person. This transition from one to the other level of thought, from a personal relationship with God to a merely technical reference, usually is exactly synchronized with the moment that I no longer can read the Holy Scripture as a word to me, but only as an object of exegetic endeavors."   He says this is   "the first step towards the worst and most widespread ministers' disease."   I find myself falling into this trap many times. If you read a passage and immediately think "How would this preach?" then you have probably fallen into this trap also. For all of you ministers who read my blog, please know that I am gonna pray for you today. I ask that you pray for me too. Thanks.
