      Woke up this morning and had my coffee on the lanai overlooking the edge of Waikiki and the discusting Ala Wai Canal.  It has just occured to me that I'll be 25 in 12 days?!?!?!  What is the point in getting older?  The only benefit of becoming 25 is that there is nolonger an added fee for renting a car when I need one which will be nice.  Beyond that, what is there?  Why can't people just stay 25 forever??? Maybe there are reasons out there that haven't passed through my mind yet.  Let me know if you have any ideas.    Today is my first long day of many, probably a summer full atleast.  My work day started today at 7:30 and will end tonight at 10:30, with a 1 1/2 hour break inbetween jobs to walk home and change from one uniform to the other.

      My roommate Geraldine and I decided to give our bathroom, entry hall and her bedroom a makeover.  After 4 hours in the mall, we ended up with some great stuff!  All Crimson! Didn't think about it until we got home, but our apartment is really showing my Cougar pride :) My roommate goes to Hawaii Pacific University, but she isn't one to own a t-shirt that says HPU, let alone use the school colors for decorating.  Oh well, I'm really liking all the red in here though.    2 months until the Coug's FOOTBALL SEASON!!!! Getting excited already!

      I have the next two days off from Little People, and I'm not sure what to do with myself.  Tomorrow won't be uneventful because I'm starting my new job, but I have no clue what to do today.  I really want to go to the beach today, I live minutes from it, but never get a chance to go play. It seems to get cloudy and rainy every time I get the chance.  What's up with that? Any ideas????

      Not sure where to start.  I've been checking out Aja's blog site recently, and thought I'd start my own...  Lets see... as most of you know, I've been living in Honolulu, HI for a year now.  Don't get me wrong I love it here, really I do, but I miss my old life as well.  As much as I disliked living in Pullman, and going to class everyday, there are days when I really miss the Palouse.  I miss the snowy mornings in the winter and the country air in the summer.  Camping just outside Moscow, working at Tri-State Idaho's most interesting store, and being just 5 minutes from my brother no matter where I was.  I don't miss the icey streets, puting chains on my studded tires in order to climb the hill to my old apartment, being 5 hours from civilization, or class itself.   Here in Hawaii I'm working two jobs, almost three. I work full time for Today's Little People, a Christian kids store in the heart of Waikiki. (check us out www.alohakids.com) am a Mary Kay rep. (www.marykay.com/heidickemp)  and starting Thursday I am employed by Fairfield Resorts International. (www.fairfieldresorts.com) Yes, I am finally using my education!!   Someday I will actually finish my degree, really I will.

Seems that everyone had the same idea tihs morning, the phone was ringing off the hook at 8am, but it such a great feeling to have people who care.  Thanks guys! I love you!!!!!!
