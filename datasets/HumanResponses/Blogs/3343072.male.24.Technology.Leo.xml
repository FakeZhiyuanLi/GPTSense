      after a long weekend of SFA im exausted and ready to go back to work, it think the only thing i've 'accomplished' this weekend is the setting up of a new windows 2003  with exchange / weboutlook 2003 (which is REALLY shiny) other then that its been a boring weekend. On the bright side my lady friend returns in 6 days!

      Somthing that REALLY makes me mad you pay like 50+ bucks for 'high speed'  internet... which is usually barely faster speed internet. my god this is worse than the 'safer' sex bullshit.  My good friend from Ohio Steve, cannot run a webserver because his isp blocks port 80 in hopes that he will pay THEM to host his website on their itty bitty 10 mb webhosting package! pure bologNA! ok im done for now.

      After takeing my vitamines i have decided that calcium pills suck. just for kicks ... ya i was bored i measure it ... each pill is an inch long and like 2cm thick wtf.... did i buy these at a pet food store or something?  Anyhow i was victim to a senseless act of KINDNESS today ....  i transfer over 20 bucks to my checkings account cause i cant buy stuff from my savings on debit.... go to this store for a pizza sub and jolt but  loe and behold even though  i transfered this 20  i had insuff funds  for 11 bucks!  So the point of the story, i was like damn this sucks, offer to put the items back in the fridge for the nice lady and shes like meh just come by tomorrow an pay we know your good for it!  so that made my nights and now my gut is full of jolt and pizzasub goodness!

      Ok, last night before i went to bed, i set my alarm at 7am.... this is normal, its 12 mid night right now.   I go to sleep.  My alarm sets off at  1am. I hear a  very destinct strange sound come from my living room like someone put down a bag of chips. I search the house.... nothing. My jolt cola ... was full, i swore i drank the fucking thing, not only that it wasnt in front of my monitor anymore it was with the empties. Feeling all haunted like i just place a pencil on the paper holding it close my eyes blank my mind, will whoevers there to write ..... it said  CORY.  im scared now. i know a cory now im wonderin if shes alright or maybe just maybe i've lost it ... into some paranoid dillusion.    In closing Garfield had the right idea no more pizza subs after midnight!!!
