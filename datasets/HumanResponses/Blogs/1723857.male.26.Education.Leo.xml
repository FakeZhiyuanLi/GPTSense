       Fiji continued...   The island taught me to hate Justin Timberlake (not that it took much to accomplish that) and many other artists I had never heard of, but hated instantly, nonetheless.  Apparently, good dance CD’s must be imported from the mainland and are hard to come by.  And all the songs on a CD must be bootleg recordings off of FM radio (they sounded horrible!).  Nikki & Gazz liked my mini-credo, “Be dependable, but not predictable.”  Maybe I should © it when I get home…  I drank nothing but water for 3 days (except for some milk in my cereal).  It wasn’t that bad…  I can’t wait to unpack!!!  Sheets that don’t smell!!  I really hope the Randwick Lodge in Sydney is nice.  Here's a list of the people we've met so far...  The Islanders 	Laura #1—met her in line at LAX; From Cincinnati, going to U. Tenn. 	 Laura #2— from London (Essex?); recently graduated university w/ a business degree; Friends w/ Danny (short for Danielle) since they were 11 years                                    old.  	Danny—friends w/ Laura; nearly identical stories (gimme a break, we were only on the island two days)  	Sarah & Nikki—graphic designers from England; Sarah was cutey #2; read to her on the rainy day (which happened to begin with a sex scene…uncomfortable moment aside, it would unfortunately not become a sign of things to come);  Sarah seemed to be holding back, though obviously (to me, anyway) was a mischievous sprite.  Gareth, aka Gazz—4th year med student (at Warwick) from Liverpool; future breast cancer surgeon; Cool guy, fast friends; Met Ana/Leslie in the back of the  bus to the island;  Buddies w/ Steve Gerrard, a young soccer star for Liverpool;  Apparently Gazz is quite the footballer himself;  Loved Justin Timberlake on the island; degree in Medical Biochem;  Going to stay with us when he swings through Sydney.  Martha, Billy, & Harry—traveling family; Mom teaches teachers in Brighton; on a world tour collecting info for their family tree; Billy & Harry are the youngest  bartenders on the island; actually met them on the bus from the airport to the Nadi Bay Hotel.  What was really cool was how the island adopted the kids.  It wouldn’t seem like an island full of 19-25 year olds would be very fun for Mum and kids, but everyone took to them.  Mom did a lot of relaxing because she knew her kids were safe.  Everyone looked out for them, played with them, especially the staff.  Emma—Kiwi (that means she's from New Zealand); most beautiful girl on the island; Awesome personality, energy, attitude; traveling with her brother and friend, who ended up becoming BF/GF on the trip; at least that’s the closest to the story I could get from all of our collective memories.   Her and here brother were the foremen on the sand castle construction, with which I assisted.  David, Sally, feat/ Edna and Nick—David is a gold digger, seriously.  He looks for gold, how cool is that?  They are from Australia, but live in Nadi; Sally teaches  school; Edna is sweat little 4 year old with a tendency to lower her voice when she gets nervous; The second thing she said to me was that her dad goes to work everyday.  That told me something.  At breakfast, she got there before her Dad and looked very uneasy, sad.  As soon as she saw him she smiled and gave him the biggest hug her little arms could manage.  Nick is 7 and didn’t seem too happy the last time I saw him; Hope he had a better time.  Lourdes—Spaniard who spoke English with an Irish accent; Moved to Ireland to improve her English; works for the Yellow Pages.  I’m telling you folks, you  can’t make this stuff up.  Cast & Crew--Staff on Robinson Crusoe Island  Ziggy—looks disturbingly like Don Cheadle; main responsibility on the island seem to be finding the prettiest girlS  on the island (i.e. Emma) and flirting with             them.  Turns out he can twirl fire, too.  Jack—resident beefcake; he cleaned the toilets and picked up the rubbish on the island; the “Snake” on the island; also lead the campfire sing-a-longs; went            around claiming it was people’s “birthday”…damn 50 Cent.  Christa—the “Cat” on the island; worked the dive shop counter, DJ (though not well), and shook her hips (VERY well)...And I'm not just being a male pig,             either.  That's how they introduced her.  OK, so maybe the other guys were being pigs, but I'm clean!  Naked boy—about 3 or 4 years old; only said “chocolates”; never figured out who exactly he belonged to

       BULA everybody!!  Robinson Crusoe Island, Fiji, July 11-13   “Oh, the people were SO nice!”  Why are people always amazed when they meet nice people?  Why do we expect to encounter rude, mean folks when we travel away from home?  Nice people DO exist outside of our hometowns, no?  Maybe we figure only nice people travel (to get away from the meanies), which leaves behind the meanies (now meaner from being left behind).  I think someone should look into that.  I came to the island a common man.  I left a stick spinning champion.  You know, that game where you have to spin around with your forehead on a stick then try to run back to the finish line.  OK, so I’m not Alexander the Great.  I ran the anchor leg on our team.  We had to resort to games like this because the weather really sucked the second day we were there.  Light rain all day long.  ANYWAY  Winning gave us our team our pick from the bar.  Now I’m not a big drinker, and apparently neither were the other guys on the team because they all ordered white wine.  I, not wanting to look like a wuss and order white wine, eventually settled on a rum and coke.  Something didn’t seem right…I had to pee pretty bad so I went…No, not there, in the restroom.  When I got back, I found out everyone had to chug their drinks and had done so in the 30 seconds I was in the can.  *Sigh*  So I get my rum/coke hoping it won’t be that strong and bottoms up!  It wasn’t that strong.  Apparently the Fijians know how to make money by watering down the hooch.  But the story doesn’t end there.  That something that didn’t seem right…well it became clear what it was.  Ziggy calls, just the guys, back to the center and presents us each with a beer.  Fiji Bitter.  This is what happens when men order girly drinks like white wine instead of Fiji’s finest.  And yes, we had to chug these, too.  It hit me like a flash just as I was putting the bottle to my lips.  I could pretend to chug the beer.  No one would really be able to tell, right?  If I do it right.  Struggle, move my throat like I’m swallowing, act like it burns, maybe even spill a little.  I later found out that neither of the other guys drank theirs, either.  My friends assured my I looked the best at faking it.  Small victories.

      OK, Gang...I couldn't figure out how to back date posts so that they would display the date they took place.  Because of this, I'm going to put up a couple of days at a time to keep from putting up 20 pages of stuff in a single post.  Here's the first stuff...Enjoy!   LEAVING TOWN   The Beginning  Why all the finality?  Everything I do I keep thinking, “This is my last…” whatever.  Last meal, last time to see the local news (like I ever watched it anyway), last time I eat a Whataburger (now that IS important).  But it won’t be the last time.  Just the last time for a while.  What is it about travel that makes us act like we aren’t coming back?  Maybe it’s hardwired from back when we were nomads.  When travel really did mean you weren’t coming back. Who knows…  I keep thinking how our perception of time changes.  Five months in Austin passes in a blink, will it work the same in down in Oz?  Being here for 2 weeks feels a lot longer than 2 weeks, that’s for sure.  I’ve done more in the last 14 days than I probably did all last year.  Probably more a commentary on my lazy ass than anything else, though.  Oh, yeah...FYI in case you haven't seen my pictures of the trip yet... I shaved my head.   Go ahead, reread that again.  I know you don't think you read it right, but you did.  Every once in a while I have to do something to keep people guessing.  I want to be dependable, but not predictable.  Plus, I figured if my hair was going to leave me I would get rid of it first.  Take THAT hair!  I mention this here because I keep forgetting.  I'll get used to it, I guess.

      Just in case anyone  does , in fact, stumble on this site before I actually post anything to it, here's the deal...  I'm creating this for my friends and family to keep up with what I'm doing while I'm studying in Sydney.  This keeps me from having to send out tons of individual emails (bad for me) and keep you guys from having to get annoying, non-personalized mass emails (no fun for you).  Right now I'm working on catching up with my entries for the last 2 weeks so give it a little time.  I can't promise any of it will be interesting, funny, or even worth reading, but I  CAN  promise...well, that you won't know it for sure until you actually do read it.

      July 26, 27, 2003	Weekend before School  Nothing much happened this weekend so I’ll take the opportunity to complain, er, comment on some of the things that are annoyingly different about Australia and that make it a backwards country.  Our first experience with this was when we asked for ketchup (tomato sauce here) and the person at the counter replied, “35 cents.”   Excuse me?!   You are going to charge us for  ketchup ?!!  Now tell me that is not ridiculous.  You can’t.  You can’t because it is ridiculous.   Next, local phone calls cost around 17 cents per call.  That’s simply annoying.  Not to mention the fact that, for some inexplicable reason, the hyphen (—)  is not used in their phone numbers anymore.  So a person could give you 96664189, 96 66 4189, 966 64 189, or any other variation.  All the cell phone numbers start with 04 so those are even worse.  Though that idea is a pretty good one, I think.  And calls from land lines to cell phones cost more, and cell phone plans charge by the minute like ours do, but without the tons of free minutes.  Talk about complicated calling plans.  10 free minutes after 7 PM, free mobile-to-mobile calls, first 5 minutes to a land line free, 100 free text messages, etc.  At the same time, there’s no charge for incoming calls.  How does an industry develop so differently in two similar countries?  Gareth came into town Sunday night.  It was good to see him again.  It’s hard to imagine that we’ve only known him for about two and a half days.  With class starting tomorrow, the girls and I are going to take turns taking him around.  It works out that way because they don’t have class on Mondays and Wednesday, and I don’t have class on Tuesday.

       July 25, 2003		Friday  	Today, the international students and their Aussie mates took a trip out to Manly.  It’s a trendy little beach community north of Sydney Harbour, probably like Venice Beach or other places in California.  I would know if I’d ever been, but I haven’t :)  We took the ferry across the Habour (by the way, that’s the way they spell harbour here…you go ahead and keep spelling it the other way, I know you were wondering), which was really cool.  Before we left the house I said to myself, “I have enough battery left in my camera for today, right?  Yeah, sure.”  This, of course, meant that my camera ran out of juice after one picture.  We hadn’t even gotten on the ferry yet. Oh, well…such is life.	 	Manly Beach had the coolest seagulls.  If I dropped one onion sliver on the ground, only the closest seagull would react.  The others wouldn’t even turn around.  The same if I dropped two slivers of onion.  When I threw down a whole handful down, there was only two gulls within ten feet.  Seagulls from far and wide instantly descended on the pile of onion, each getting a sliver.  It was kind of scary to have 20 seagulls rush at me, but they were like F-16 jets landing on an aircraft carrier the way they stopped right on the onions.  OK, maybe YOU don’t think that’s all that great, but I thought it was pretty neat. 	At night we had the official welcome party at the  urlLink Coogee Beach Palace Hotel .  Before you get visions of marble floors and chandeliers, let me clarify something.  In Australia, they call bars or pubs hotels.  It goes back to the days when most of Australia was sparsely populated.  Just like the saloons with rooms upstairs in the Old West, the hotel would have a bar downstairs that was the central gathering place for the town.  It was right on Coogee Beach.  (Where we almost lived, remember?).  More meeting, greeting, getting names, forgetting names.   We stayed until about midnight, late for us old folks.  It reminded me just how much I hate, yes   hate  , house/dance/techno music and cigarette smoke.  And there was plenty of both.  At least back in Austin you can’t smoke in the clubs and bars.

       August 23, 2003	Saturday   The exchange office organized a group outing to a “Footy match” tonight.  Footy actually refers to rugby here in New South Wales, but this game was Australian Rules Football which is called “footy” in Victoria (where Melbourne is).  The games are fairly similar, but you can tell which one you are watching by looking at the uniforms and the number of posts in the “end zone”.  Aussie Rules has 4 sticks and the uniforms are sleeveless.  Rugby (Union and League…I won’t even try to explain that distinction except to say that I am told the private school boys play Union and blue collar thugs play League.) uniforms have sleeves and there are only 2 posts; rugby also has “scrums”, where two huge groups of thick-necked men appear to head butt each other.  Aussie Rules looks roughly like our football, but has high scoring like basketball and people run around everywhere like soccer.  The game was between the hometown  urlLink Sydney Swans  and the  urlLink Collingwood Magpies  (2 of the sissiest team names I’ve heard since the Hawaii Rainbows).  It was a big game with playoff implications, Collingwood being the Aussie Rules equivalent of the Chicago Bulls of the Jordan era.  That’s what the Magpie fan in front of us told me, anyway.  Did I mention we were sitting in the Collingwood section?  Enemy territory…  The game was played at  urlLink Telstra Stadium  (Telstra is the big phone company here), which is where the opening ceremonies for the Olympics were held.  We set some sort of attendance record, most for a non-playoff game/played on a Saturday/during a full moon/in the rain…that sort of thing.  Either way, 76,000 people is chingos, as we would say in my ‘hood.  	[Brief definition of the word chingos—Chingos is a slang term that represents a huge, astronomical number;  To give you an idea, take the largest number you can think of, add infinity, and double it…that should get you close;  The amount represented by chingos can be increased by stretching it out when said, for example “Chhhhiiiiiinnnnngosss” would indicate a greater number of things than simply “Chingos.”; Now back to the show…]  As for the game, it is kinda hard to really cheer and boo and the right times when you don’t know the rules or what the referees’ little gestures mean, but we managed.  It was obvious even to the uninitiated that Sydney played with their heads up their collective butts for the first 3 quarters.  They were down by 6 goals (like touchdowns) when they decided they felt like playing. (During the rally, I tried to explain the concept of “rally caps” to some of my friends from Europe, but I didn’t get very far.)  Things finally got exciting when the Swans cut the lead to 2 goals with about 3 minutes to go, but a defensive blunder led to a Magpie goal that pretty much killed the rally.  Oh yeah…and it rained the ENTIRE NIGHT!!  I was cold and VERY WET…it wasn’t nice.  I’ve got a great picture on Snapfish.com that shows a little of what it was like.

       July 24, 2003		Thursday  	It’s my birthday today, which means it will last for 39 hours.  Today we had to register for classes.  Luckily, I because we were law students, we got to skip most of the massive lines everyone else had to wait in.  Our day went much smoother than many of the other students.  Still, actually getting the classes I wanted took a little doing.  The law school was being shady about what classes are available.  They were telling us classes were full when they weren’t. Another law student caught them doing that, forcing them to admit they were just trying to save the seats for their own students.  I can’t really blame them for that, really.  At UT, the state legislature says that 80% of the students must be Texas residents.  It’s the same thing, really.  They should have just told us.  I finally got fed up trying to pick a class they would let me enroll in and told the girl to just enroll (which is spelled with one ‘l’ here in Australia) me in anything because I was just going to change it later.  Classes are bound to open up after local students start changing around their classes. 	We went out to dinner to a Thai restaurant (there is one every 20 feet here) in the city.  Ana, Leslie, and my Aussie mate Angela (the school matches up exchange students with locals).  Afterwards, Leslie and I went to see my favorite comedian.   urlLink Eddie Izzard  just happened to be in Sydney with his new show so it was a happy coincidence that all the shows sold out forcing them to add a show on my birthday.  All in all, a pretty good birthday.

       July 21-23, 2003	Orientation Week  	We actually have things to do this week.  Orientation reminds us that we actually have to go to classes while we’re here…bummer.  We were in these sessions from 9:30 AM until 1:30 PM, it was ridiculous.  We covered all sorts of information, mostly helpful stuff like schedule for the week, but they also talked about cultural differences.  Some of the stuff was pretty funny.  Here are my favorite parts of the huge magazine thing they gave us: 	 “ There are two stereotypes which can harm male-female relationships between Australians and international students.  The first stereotype (held by some overseas males) is that Australian females are always willing to have sex.  The second stereotype (held by some Australian females) is that most males from overseas have no interest in Australian females, other than to have sex with them….These…stereotypes…can lead to a great deal of misunderstanding.”   	 “It is not unusual, at the end of a date, for your companion to invite you into his or her place for a coffee.  The invitation does not imply that you are being invited to have sex with your companion.  You are not obliged to accept the invitation…”   	Eddie Izzard has a whole bit how it is sometimes hard to tell if “Would you like a cup of coffee?” means just that, or “Would you like to do it?”  His basic dividing line is that if the President of Burundi asks you if you want some coffee, it means he wants to know if you want some coffee.  A good rule of thumb, I feel.  They gave us all these little “gift bags” full of useless pamphlets and other pieces of paper.  The bags were supposed to include a condom, but for some reason didn’t.  They assured us (just in case anyone was truly worried) that they would come in the next day, the day we were to enroll in classes.  One of the younger staff members said, “That way, after you enroll you can roll one on.”  They aren’t as uptight about stuff like that here, if you couldn’t tell.  We also had a presentation by an Aboriginal group where they gave us a quick history and played the didgeridoo.  There was also a surfing demonstration, inside the lecture hall if you can believe that.  It was really funny, but in a “you had to be there” sort of way so I won’t bore you. 	 There were about 140 international exchange students at the orientation.  About 30% of UNSW students are from overseas.  They say that is the largest proportion of any university in the world.  I can’t tell you how tired I got of asking and answering the same questions over and over.  Where are you from?  What are you studying?  How long have you been in Sydney?  Ugh.  We’re all for meeting new people and making friends, but sometimes you just don’t care.

       July 20, 2003		Sunday  	It rained today.  All day.  I got wet.  Very wet.  We were supposed to have a cookout with all the exchange folks today.  People still showed up with their meat (it was BYO meat), though.  We ended up walking, in the rain, to a close by area with restaurants and stuff.  A ten minute walk is short in good weather, in the rain it’s quite long.  We must have looked weird…40 kids holding plastic bags w/ meat, walking in the rain.  Oh,well.  Back to the mall by the house to do a little grocery shopping. Grocery shopping.  Sounds simple, right?  It made me hate this place, for a little while anyway.  They don’t have any of the foods I eat back home.  None.  No Eggo Waffles, no Pillsbury biscuits, no chicken strips, and forget about those microwave Salisbury and chicken fried steaks or marinated fajitas from H-E-B and my beloved Totino’s pizzas.  Don’t even ask about Mexican food.  Apparently, Old El Paso is the only company to manage to find Australia on a map and send their food here.  There isn’t even a section for it.  The Old El Paso shelf in the Asian food section, don’t ask me why.  You know it’s the lowest traffic area in the whole store because that’s where they put the ladies cooking the free samples.  “No one ever buys Mexican food…we’ll put a person grilling meat right in front of the entire shelf.  No one will even notice.”  I’m sure it went something like that. They also have this strange fascination with meat pies, something they inherited from the British. It's just like a chicken pot pie, but filled with beef and gravy instead.  Pretty messy, actuall, but Gareth loves them.   This was all kind of depressing.  I’m going to have to actually cook things.  When I’m hungry I want to eat, not cook.  Oh, well.  Still, this country is so backwards.  More on that later.

       July 19, 2003		Saturday  	Moved in bright and early this morning.  We are never going to be able to fill up all this space.  We kept having to remind ourselves we are only going to be here for one semester so that we wouldn’t buy all kinds of knick-knacks and furnishings.  “Rubbish” as Gareth would say.  FINALLY got to unpack our suitcases.  Good feeling.  My closet has the oddest arrangement of shelve compartments.  There are 3 sliding mirror doors, and some of the shelves can’t be accessed easily no matter which door is opened.  This will prove to be a pain in the arse. 	First order of business was to hit the mall for supplies.  We planned on making two trips since we could only buy as much as we could carry.  Luckily, we ran into Sean, Michelle, etc. at Target and they offered to take home what we had bought already.  They are being really great to us.  We are starting to feel bad when they do things for us.  This helped out a lot because we wouldn’t have had time to come back to get groceries like we had planned.  Everything here closes so damn early!!  Stores close at 5:30 or 6 PM during the week.  Thursday is know as “Late night shopping” day so the stores stay open until 9 PM and judging by the number of people out, it’s a BIG deal.  Second order of business was to clean.  The place was recently renovated (it had just been painted a few days before).  That took a bit of work.  No one had ever cleaned on top of the cabinets…until me, that is.   Mom would be proud. 	Houses here don’t have any central heat or air conditioning.  It is winter here, remember.  It still gets pretty cold at night.  We all bought a blanket (for $5 Aus., not bad), but that wasn’t going to be enough.  Michelle left us an electric heater, which is great, but the girls get to keep that in their room.  Luckily, Michelle also brought down some old comforters which did a great job…as long as I stay in bed.  The rest of the house is still a freaking popsicle in the mornings.  Colder inside than outside.  And the way the house is oriented, it gets virtually no direct sunlight so the house never warms up.  That’s good in the summertime, I imagine, but sucks right now.  Only the back extra room (we have so many rooms some of them don’t even have names) gets sun so that one room is warm in the afternoon, while the other side of the house is freezing.  I’m going to have to buy a little heater.  I hope they aren’t too expensive.

       July 18, 2003  	FINALLY went out to see Sydney.  We decided to hit the Harbour.  So far, much of what we had seen reminded us a lot of the States.  The houses in our neighborhood would fit in with the houses in any working class neighborhood in Kansas City or Chicago.  The mall near our house is very American in concept, if not in design, down to gaggles of roaming teenagers.  But riding the bus into downtown Sydney…NOW we felt like we were in Australia.  We got off at Circular Quay (pronounced ‘key’) and walked down towards the Opera House.  To be honest, it was kinda underwhelming, but then again, I’ve never been one to be awed by buildings.  It was probably because we didn’t actually get that close, much less go inside. 	 MORE WALKING…We walked around the Royal Botanical Gardens for a few hours.  That was nice, despite there not being much in the way of flowers.  Mostly green trees and bushes.  The highlight was watching the biggest f*cking bats I’ve ever seen.  These suckers must have weighed at least 7 lbs. with bodies around a foot long!  And yes, the were flying around.  Last night at the Randwick Lodge.  Tomorrow is move-in day.

       July 17, 2003  	Slow day.  Got bank accounts, we all called home.  They had a little thing for us international students.  Met MY Aussie mate, Angela.  The girls are making me share her.  As soon as she said she like to shop, I knew she was my Aussie mate in name only.  Simon and Shereen in the exchange office are cool.  Met a couple of folks, a few characters.  It will be interesting to see what the law folks are like. 	 I’m really hoping I stay up past 10PM tonight. Hey, don’t laugh.  It will be harder than it sounds.  Our bodies can slowly adjust to the seasons, but doesn’t do so well when the sun sets at 8:30 PM one day and 5:30 the next.  8PM feels like 11PM.  	We’re moving in on Saturday!  With a perfect script written by me and perfect execution by Leslie we were able to get Sean to pick us up from the Randwick, including Ana’s luggage!  This was a big deal for us.  By this point, though things hadn’t been going bad, we were still very grateful for small victories like this. Michelle called and said they needed the deposit tomorrow.  We thought that was a bit weird, especially since we were moving in Saturday.  We ended up just writing up a receipt and hoping for the best.      	The news updates for one of the channels has the same bumper music as the NBC Nightly News…weird.  Another station has the same slogan and very similar opening video as ABC.  They only have, like, 4 broadcast stations here.  Apparently, they only got cable TV eight years ago.  And it is all subsidized by the government…strange.  	The birds here don’t “sing.”  They yell and scream like old men arguing about politics or children fighting over a toy.  It is quite disconcerting.

       July 16, 2003  	More agonizing…beach or ‘burbs?  We got Patrick to drive us to the suburb in the daylight (Ana’s request), then drop us off in Coogee.  He and Lenka were so nice.  After a quick lunch of fish & chips (again), we decided to take the grown-up house. 	We did MORE walking around Coogee.  The beach is really nice, and the weather was beautiful.  It has been easy to forget that it is Winter here. 	Michelle, her husband Sean, and their two kids Amber (7) and Lockland (1) live upstairs.  They have a separate entrance in the back.  All of us are hoping this doesn’t turn ugly.  Michelle assures us she won’t be butting into what we do because she “remembers what being at uni was like.”  I wonder what they do? 	Bought my Eddie Izzard tickets.  All the other shows were almost sold out so he added a show on my birthday.  I had to decide between tickets for all three of us in the upper balcony, or 2 tickets in row J.  It’s my birthday, the girls don’t even know who Izzard is…I went for row J.  I figure I’ll try to find a nice British girl who knows Izzard to go with me.

       July 15, 2003   	This whole money conversion thing is a pain.  It doesn’t help that apartments are list rent by the week, not month and utilities are billed by the quarter.  Stupid Australia. 	Spent all day looking at apartments.  First place looked really dodgy (another piece of British slang I've picked up).  It was a 5 bdrm house that didn’t seem to have been kept up very well.  2nd place was old w/ a fairly nice old lady to match. 	3rd place was really nice.  Pauline (the rental agent) picked us up which was soooooo good after spending all morning walking.  It was only 2 bedrooms, and a small 2 bdrm at that.   The big selling point, besides being clean, was that it was 2 blocks from Coogee Beach.  After seeing the first 2 places, the apartment in Coogee looked like Heaven.  The girls thought is was “really cute” so of course they liked it.  The only problem was that it was small.  Probably wouldn’t be comfortable for the throngs of people that will be visiting the girls.  (Family and friends, you gutter brains :)  After seeing the place, I voted to cancel the later (6:30 PM) appointment we made.  I figured it was a waste of everyone’s time if we were just going to take the Coogee, anyway.  Patrick (not Patrice, not Petrie, which I thought his name was due to his thick accent), the housing office guy, said he wouldn’t bother going to see it because it was way out in the suburbs.  We decided to visit anyway, just to see it. 	We had a grumpy bus driver.  The situation wasn’t helped when Ana decided to give him a $20 instead of paying w/ exact change just b/c he was being grumpy.  After getting on, we realized we didn’t know where to get off, and now we couldn’t ask the bus driver b/c Ana had pissed him off.  Thankfully, b/t the 3 of us we are able to figure out most things so there weren’t any problems. 	Michelle was outside sweeping when we came down the street.  It was a HOUSE.  An honest to goodness, place for grown-ups, house.  Michelle and her family had lived in the ground floor before deciding to build a second story and move up there.  The house has hardwood floors that look nice (minus the paint spots).  It’s HUGE!  This created a real dilemma.  This place was MUCH bigger, not to mention cheaper that the apartment in Coogee.  I don’t know if Michelle was sensing our hesitation or just really nice, but everytime therewas a pause she would throw something else in.  She had already said she would furnish the place w/ new renal furniture, but she also said she would give us her extra dishware, sheets, and stuff.  All stuff we would have to buy.  Looks like too much to pass up.  Most of dinner was spent thinking about which place we should take. 	Stepping back, having 2 places to choose from after only being in town 2 days isn’t too shabby.

       Sydney  July 14, 2003 The airport is definitely the most trendy/posh one I’ve ever been in.  They force int’l arrivals walk through the duty free shop…that’s pretty shrewd. People were acting like it was cold.  Felt like a beautiful spring day in Austin, around 65 degrees.  Found out later it was the warmest temperature for that date in history...go figure. Taxi to the Randwick was another one of those ubiquitous (outside the US) little vans w/ a hair dryer engine, complete w/ a surly E. European driver. Randwick IS cool…run by the Kelly’s. I will be VERY happy when I can stop lugging my bags (not to mention Ana’s 75 lb. monster) up stairs! Made it up to UNSW today.  Turned out Ana and I weren’t actually registered yet so we had to go see the folks at the law school. Jen was nice enough, but I caught a definite vibe when we (mainly I) were trying to pick classes that weren’t on the short list she gave us.  I asked if there was anything like the “forcing” we have, and she answered with something about limited class space and the fire code.  I knew right then I was going to have to do this myself.

       Fraser Island Trip--Sunday, Day 2   Keep in mind, the pictures really tell a better story!!! Check them out if you haven’t done it yet…  We left for Fraser Island at 8 PM.  Our first stop was Byron Bay, New South Wales, and we got there about 7:30 in the morning.  We were early so we couldn’t actually check into our rooms at the hostel.  While everyone else was standing around with their fingers up their butts, Ana and I availed ourselves of the free bikes the hostel had.  We rode around the town.  It was a quaint little beach resort town, really quiet at 8 AM.  We only rode for about 10 minutes because the bicycle seats were specially designed to be extra painful.  We had a crappy eggs-n-toast breakfast at a place I later noticed was for sale (never a good sign) then headed back to the beach.  I spent the rest of the morning walking to the Cape Byron Lighthouse, which is Australia’s easternmost point.  The highlight of this day was kayaking on the Brunswick River.  I have some great pictures of the sun setting over Mount Chincogan so go check them out!  Our guide spent a year getting all the permits to give tours on the river (it goes through national park land).  He’s the only one who does it because the long process keeps others away.  You could tell he was really passionate about his job and the land.  His voice got soft when he was telling us how he would have to stop the river tours if his liability insurance rates went up any more.  I went home soaking wet, freezing my ass off, and really happy.

       SHORTS!!   I actually got to wear shorts to school today!  The high was 30C, which is about 80-something degrees.  I hope this means Spring is finally here and I can wear all the clothes I brought.  I loved being a manger, but I’m getting a little tired of wearing my black windbreaker everywhere.  I get asked, “Women’s basketball, huh…Did you play?” everytime I wear it, and every single person thinks they are the first person to ask me that.  I only have so much patience…

      Listen to what a moron I am….  I’ve had been working on this paper for one of my classes for about a week.  I even stayed home while everyone else in the house went to Port Stephens (could there BE a better name for a port?).  After much struggle trying to reach the 6,000 word limit (which isn’t a lot, really), I finally decide 5,200 is good enough.   Before cleaning it up, I checked our syllabus to figure out how to turn it in (that story later…).  While I’m scanning the page I see, “The word limit for this essay is 3,000 WORDS”!!!!!  I had 3,000 words 3 days before!!!  Dejected, I decided to have dinner first.  Then I spent the next 4 hours (and part of the next morning) trying to cut my paper down.  I finally got it to 3,100 and stopped.    So I go to turn the paper in (cue theme music)…Another way Australia is backwards (I think I’ll trademark that phrase and start a newspaper column or TV show…)  Well, probably not Australia so much as UNSW.  The professor says to turn in the paper at the main reception desk of the law school so we can get a receipt.  This makes sense.  We turn in papers at the communications desk at UTLaw for the same reason—get things time/date stamped and what not.  But no…things can’t work that way at UNSW.  First, no one is at the desk (Small tangent…The counter closes for lunch!  No staggering of lunch breaks or covering by other folks in the office here, no sir!  Who cares if students need something?  Back to the story…)  No problem, I says.  I’ll just ring the little bell (yes…there is a little bell).  Oh, no I won’t.  There is a handwritten sign that says “If you are turning in an assignment, do not ring the bell.”  How helpful.  Underneath the counter is a slit in the desk labeled “Assignments”.  I looked into the slot and saw an enormous Salvation Army-type bin.  There was all kinds of stuff in there—essays, applications, letters.  All just tossed in this big wooden bin.  Just as I was about to drop my essay in the slot (I had forgotten to put my class, prof’s name, etc. on it), I saw a little stack of forms.  From what I was able to figure out, you fill out the little form (prof’s name, class #, word count, student id) and staple it to your essay.  Then you toss it into the abyss and hope the capable staff sorts it out.  No receipt.  No time stamp.  I’d rather slide it under a professor’s door or something.

       Blue Mountains, abseiling    urlLink The Blue Mountains  are only a 2 hour train ride from Sydney.  We came into the town of Katoomba (how fun is that to say?) at around 10 PM so we could get an early start.  The  urlLink youth hostel  we stayed at was really nice.  Kind of like a big frat house, but cleaner and without all the pretentiousness.  They had a big screen TV, pool table, kitchen where you could cook your own food, and board games.  After we got back from abseiling (don’t worry, I’ll explain what that is in a bit), we played a game called “Speed Scrabble.”  Basically, each player pulls tiles from the pile and tries to use them all in their own little Scrabble game.  The first one to use all their tiles says, “GO!” and everyone pulls another tile, and so on until all the tiles are gone and someone can use all the ones they have.  I made us play about 4 extra rounds because I hadn’t won.  I got stuck with the Q TWICE!!  Never got a single U to go with it.  That’s just not fair.  Anyway, on to the abseiling.  To us in the States,  urlLink abseiling  is repelling, as in off a cliff.  According to our guide, the German and the French started doing this sort of stuff at the same time.  “Rapel” comes from the French word for, well…rapelling, and “abseiling” is German for “down rope.”  We signed up for the entire day package so we started early.  The cool thing was that the four of us (Ana, Leslie, Leslie’s friend Lynn, and myself) were the only people in the group for most of the day.  It was like having a private instructor.  There was another girl from Denmark, I think, who was with us in the morning.  She enjoyed the beautiful mountain scenery and fresh air by having a cigarette every five minutes.  Some things I’ll never understand.  The weather kinda sucked.  It was about 50° F, windy, and overcast all day.  And I mean hella windy.  Dangling off the side of a 30 meter cliff doesn’t help, know what I’m sayin’?  We started with 15 and 30 meter cliffs in the morning.  The best part was the 60 meter cliff we did in the afternoon.  That’s over 200 feet, y’all!  Actually, the 30 meter was scarier because the first few steps (the hardest ones to begin with) were blind because the ledge receded right after a foot or two.  After starting, going down was easy—gravity did all the work.  The girls had a harder time getting started because they weighed less (that gravity thing) and 60+ meters of rope weighs a lot.  To let yourself drop you have to move the rope from behind your hip out to your side.  It can take some effort, especially at the beginning.  I have a video of it… urlLink click here  if you want to see it.  (WARNING:  The file is pretty big (14 MB)…you might want to download it somewhere with a fast connection.) (Also try to right-click and choose "Save target as...")  The really hard part was the hike back up the mountain.  It was 7 minutes of uphill hiking up narrow paths over rocks and trees.  It took so long to get up that everyone behind you had already gone by the time you got back to the top.  You got there just in time to hook up and go again.  We all had to help get all the ropes and harnesses together in order to beat the rainstorm we could see coming through the valley.  Needless to say, we were all pretty pooped that night.  Leslie and Lynn stayed another day for a hike, and Ana and I came back to Sydney.  It seemed like a lot longer than a one day trip.  Tons of fun!

      For the next 2 weeks, there are going to be SEVEN people in our house!!  3 beds, 2 air mattresses, and only 4 chairs.  This is going to be fun…It'll be just like summer camp, but without the mosquitos and acne.  (Or at least, how I imagine summer camp to be from watching TV...folks from my neck of the woods don't really go to summer camp.)

      Another way this country is backwards…I tried to buy some rubbing alcohol for my ear.  Yes, there is  STILL  water in my ear.  Sounds easy, right?  Any grocery, pharmacy, etc. should have it.  The grocery store does not, but never fear, plenty of pharmacies around.  After searching the shelves myself for about 5 minutes, all I could find was Swimmer’s Ear, which was $13 for a little bottle.  I asked the pharmacist if they carried any rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol, just in case the called it something different here.  She pointed me to a bright green bottle of something called “Isopropylcol” or something like that.  It was cheaper, but just didn’t seem right.  The label called it an “antiseptic lotion”.  Now, I know what lotion is.  And from my time here, Australians have the same definition of “lotion” that we do as far as I can tell.  I wasn’t about to pour something called a lotion down my ear.  I had to settle for the Swimmer’s Ear.  I got the water out just in time for my second lesson.

      September 5, 2003	Surf lesson  Today, I had my first surfing lesson at the world famous  urlLink Bondi Beach .  Pictures of Bondi are on Snapfish, but sadly there are none of me surfing.  Hard to do both at one time, you see. I started by getting to the surf shop 10 minutes late!  Technically, I was in Bondi 30 minutes early and got within 100 yards from the shop before getting “lost”.  SO CLOSE!  Whoever designed the streets here should be shot, that’s all I have to say.  Streets shouldn’t merge into another street, then spit off and continue further down the road.  And heaven forbid you have numbers on your buildings and street signs at intersections.  Thankfully, almost no matter your physique pretty much everyone looks cool in a wetsuit.  The water was a little chilly, but the wetsuit works very well so I didn’t notice it at all.  The first thing I remembered when we finally got in the water is why I don’t like swimming in the ocean—It has SALT in it!  It is so annoying.  I caught on quickly as we practiced catching waves without standing up.  This part was easy; I even went up on my knees on the first try.  I then spent the next hour and a half trying to stand up without succeeding.  In my old age, I have mellowed quite a bit and my competitive streak rarely surfaces anymore.  But I was nearly getting very MAD because I couldn’t stand up.  I kept getting stuck trying to get my legs underneath me.  The frustrating thing was that I knew what to do, I knew what I was doing wrong, and I knew how to fix it…I just wasn’t doing it.  The part that sucked the most was that there were people who were standing up, but doing everything wrong!  It just didn't seem fair.  I guess the silver lining is that I bought a 5 session package so I have 4 more chances to get it right.  I just hope I don’t get tired of the structure after the 3rd lesson.  I somehow managed to slice a layer of skin off of my foot, but don’t remember how or when.  I also almost sprained my hand when I got tossed by a wave and tried to stop myself by putting my hand down.  All in all though, I got home in one piece…and tired!  Surfing is hard work.  I thought about it, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fat surfer.  The only bad thing about the day was that I have water in my ear and it REFUSES to come out!

      Crap...I've run out of the "back issues" of the blog, so to speak.  I haven't actually written anything since August 7th; that's almost a month!  Good thing is not much has happened since then.  Bad thing is I have school stuff to do now, meaning less time to share this with...well, no one really.  I know I'm the only one that reads this thing, but oh well...  I'll try to get things up soon...New pictures are up on Snapfish.com if you want to head on over there...

       August 7, 2003	Thursday  After a week of class, I’ve already been called on twice to provide “the American perspective” in class discussion. I wasn’t called on twice in my entire first year of law school.  I kind of asked for it, though.  Two of my three classes were not on the list the office tried to convince us were the only ones “available.”  Therefore, I’m the only international student in either class.  Representing an entire country can be hard work.  Then again, if George W. can do it I can, too.  Actually, he probably makes it easier for me.  He has to be all, “Hey!  I’m the President…I’m from Texas, where we used to execute people every 15 minutes…I know what I’m doing, because the people that worked with my Dad tell me what to do.”  That let’s me be a little more moderate and show Australians not all Americans, and especially not all Texans, are war-mongering, death penalty supporting, gun toting rednecks who can’t speak English right…er, correctly.  Ana, myself, and another law exchange student went to see the new “American Pie” movie tonight.  Pretty damn funny, I have to say.  Well worth the $7.50 AUS ($5 US).  I highly recommend it to all of you who aren't too uptight to enjoy some really good bathroom humor.

       August 4, 2003	     Monday  Today we all went to Leichardt, one of the many suburbs of Sydney.  (Sydney itself is actually very small.  Most of the city is made up of all these smaller suburbs.  Sort of like SoHo, the East Village, Harlem, etc. are parts of New York City.)  This neighborhood is Sydney’s Little Italy.  We had some really good Italian food (of course), as I would expect from a place where Italian was still spoken on the streets.  Gareth and the girls headed back to Darling Harbour to visit more touristy things, while I had to *sigh* go to class.  The big news over here is what happened during the big Australia vs. South Africa rugby match last week.  The South Africans were busted eye gouging and biting during the game.  You should see the  urlLink bite marks , ouch!  The player that did that only got suspended 8 games.  The rugby leagues “sentencing guidelines” say biting should get at least, like, 16 games or something.  Needless to say, Aussies are pissed.  The South Africans went on to play New Zealand, where the coach said he was glad to go because they didn’t “play like sissies.”  Wow.

       August 1, 2003	Saturday   Gareth, the brave soul that he is, did the  urlLink Bridge Climb  today. That is "bridge climb" as in, he climb OVER the Sydney Harbour Bridge...you know, like the top.  He also looked at his pictures from the bridge climb every hour on the hour for the rest of the day.  We met him downtown for an early dinner at a place called “Pancakes.”  They serve, oh I’ll let you guess…You got it, pancakes!  Ana had been going on and on about their chocolate pancake covered in chocolate syrup, topped with chocolate ice cream and chocolate chips.  I was less than impressed, but oh well.  Ana is continually making up excuses to go there; she's got a thing for chocolate, you see.  Personally, my body doesn’t know how to enjoy pancakes at 4:30 in the afternoon.  We caught an Australian movie called “Danny Deckchair” starring Rhys Ifans (Hugh Grant’s skinny, dorky flatmate from “Notting Hill.”)  The movie was kinda…eh.  There’s just nothing else out here that I haven’t seen.  I saw a bunch of movies before I left, and most of them haven’t even come out here, yet.  Even movies I saw back in January.  One movie that’s still in theaters here we saw on the plane!  “Agent Cody Banks” was also playing on the plane, and THAT doesn’t come out for another MONTH!  Another little way this country is backwards.  Oh, well…   August 3, 2003	Sunday  We all went for a walk, today.  The longest freaking walk of my life!  We walked from the famous Bondi Beach all the way down to Coogee Beach.  It took 3 hours!  We went up hills and down hills, across beaches and around bays, even through a cemetery.  Today was one long day.  I did have some pretty good fish-n-chips (French fries) in Bondi.  They came wrapped in paper; the fish and chips all together.  And yes, the ketchup was extra.  As always, pictures are up on Snapfish.com.

       July 29, 2003		Tuesday  No class today, but that will change soon.  I’m going to have class 4 days a week.  If I’m not careful, class might develop into a habit.  The whole gang (Leslie and Ana didn’t have class until 6PM) hit downtown again.  We checked out the Centerpoint Tower, pictures on Snapfish.  Back in the day, every major city in the world decided that they had to have a huge tower, so this is Sydney’s.  My favorite part was that it had a huge doughnut full of water that acts as a balance.  The huge balance keeps the tower from tipping over if all the people are standing on the same side, like to watch the New Year’s fireworks on the Harbour Bridge.  I’d like to think making something that big tip over wouldn’t be that easy, but oh well.  If we need a big water doughnut to keep it from falling over like a stack of Lego’s then I’m all for it.  Afterwards, the girls headed to class and Gareth and I had a look around.  We checked out the  urlLink Queen Victoria Building .  It used to be this really old important building until whatever the important stuff was moved and they let it go to pot.  The government was going to tear it down until some foreign rich guy turned it into the nicest mall I’ve ever been in.  It’s nice to see big business saving history instead of tearing it down, for a change.  Then we walked to the Bridge to walk up the “Pylon”.  Actually climbing on top of the bridge costs about $150 US, but you can climb up one of the pylons for $6 US.  The stupid pylon closed at 5 PM and we got there at 5:10 PM.  How much does that suck?  We ended up walking across the bridge and back, watching the sunset and lights turn on.  I am finding it mildly disturbing that Gareth and I have shared so many romantic sunsets.

      August 29, 2003	Julie’s weekend visit  Julie, our friend from law school, came up from Melbourne (a 10 hour trip by high-speed train) this weekend.  She is doing exchange like we are.  Though she knows both me and Leslie, I am claiming her for my visitor list because the girls already have a small nation of their peeps visiting them.  The big thing we did was go to the opera.  We got all dressed up (pictures on Snapfish).  I got to wear my suit so bringing it was not a total waste.  There actually isn’t a dress code for the opera itself, but we had dinner at the restaurant inside it, which did have one.  For $500 (7 people), I think I should have been able to wear whatever I wanted.  Oh, well...the hamburger I had was great.  JUST KIDDING!!  I had some sort of fancy-ass chicken thing with some other sort of corn/bean (cous-cous?) thing on it.  It wasn't bad.  We also spent a day at Manly Beach, capping the evening off by watching “Finding Nemo” (a super cute movie, BTW).  It has only been out here for 2 weeks!!

       July 28, 2003		Monday  Today was the start of what is shaping up to be a really busy week.  Classes start this week, and we get to play tourist with Gareth for the next 10 days (yeah!).  As far as classes go, things are the same, but different if that makes any sense.  I’ve always known how lucky we are to go to a) a school in the States, and b) a school with the resources and facilities like UT.  Being here really makes me appreciate even our crappy classrooms.  The school isn’t dirty or anything, it’s just small with very odd design features.  The desks in my first class made me feel like I was in a 747.  A row of individual, but connected, seats with a desk that folds down from the seat in front of you.  Once you’re in, you’re in…there is no getting up unless you want to make the entire row of people fold up their desks and stand up to let you out.  It’s really funny watching everyone trying to get into the elevators (“lifts” here) before class because no one seems to get the concept of getting to class early so EVERYONE is trying to get upstairs at the same time.  I was let in on a little secret by one of the students, though.  Turns out that only 3 of the 6 elevators actually works. Fun.  The elevators are also the most impatient ones I’ve ever seen.  You really have to be on your toes or you could lose them.  Some of the students were saying there was an elevator in the library that routinely opens up mid-floor and has sudden drops.  Who needs Astroworld with rides like that?  I’ve added another entry on my list of businesses I could bring here and make a fortune (I can’t really remember the rest of the list right now so don’t ask).  They really need a system to handle used textbooks.  They have a secondhand bookstore on campus (good),  but apparently nobody uses it (bad).  This kind of thing doesn’t work if nobody uses it.  The regular campus bookstore doesn’t buy back used books.  You can’t even get your money back if you return books, even the next day!  Store credit is SO lame.  I still haven’t gotten a good answer as to what everyone does with their old books.  They can’t possibly keep them all, and I can’t imagine that every single person puts up little flyers all over the place.  The books must end up in the same place as socks from the dryer and Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction.

      I'm in the middle of the last lap, guys.  It is hard to believe I've been here since July, and it's almost over.  I decided to stay an extra few weeks to hang out with my friends.  Until then, though, I've got some take home exams to tackle.  I just got my final trial out of the way today, but still have this stupid paper to do.  You can see I can't go crazy just quite yet.  I'll try to keep up with things over the next few weeks, but no guarantees.  Then again, what does it matter?  I'm the only one that reads this anyway...:)

      Okay...some of my Australian friends commented that much of this journal was nothing but "winging" (pronounced "winj-ing", it means complaining) about all the ways (and there are many) that Australia sucks.  In honor of those friends, I decided to put together a little list of the things I think Australia does right.  Don't worry, you won't be here long.  It's a pretty short list.   1)  The Half Flush --Australians tend to be a little more concious of the environment, I think.  Most of the toilets here have a "half flush" to save water.  You don't have to unleash all of the awesome power your toilet can muster, like when all it has to do is remove last nights six-pack, ya' know?    2)  Serious about drunk driving --the legal limit here is .05...that's about one drink.  Many of the kids I know seem pretty conscientious about picking a DD or taking a taxi when they get "pissed" (Australian for "drunk").   3)  The Food --so many immigrants from so many countries means you can get great Italian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian, Greek, and on , and on.   4)  Sports --the entire country is sports CRAZY!!!  Now, Americans like sports, but here it is engrained in the national identity.  Here, it is the norm that girls AND guys get into rugby.  Both sexes will likely know their sport.  Many of the commentary teams include women, but it's not a big deal like it is in the US.  No one questions that the women know their stuff (they are also no where  near  as hot as the girls on US sports shows, but that's another story).   5)  Reading --Australians love to read (the ones that can, anyway...OOOH, good one!)  There are bookstores everywhere!!   6)  Fat French Fries --This may seem trivial, but I assure you it is not.  I have spent time in the french fry frying business so I know what I'm talking about.  Fat fries not only have a better taste, texture, and consistency, but are also harder for the morons that cook them to mess up.  That means I get great fries almost everywhere I go :)    There you have it folks!  A few areas that Oz has their stuff together.  Good On Ya', Australia!! (That's how they says "Job well done.")

      Just posted broad strokes about my trip to Fraser Island a few weeks back...I back dated the post so things would be in order.  Just scroll down to see them.  To those of you who have been trying to join  urlLink Friendster  because of that email I sent, keep trying!

      Here's something I wrote a while back...just hadn't posted it yet...  There’s an Australian cricket player named Shane Warne who has been in the news lately.  This guy is like the Dennis Rodman of cricket (if such a thing is possible) in that he is always getting in trouble (not because of his hair style or tattoos).  His favorite seems to be getting accused of sexual harassment (and implicitly, adultery since he IS married with kids) by women all over the world.  Seems Shane is fond of sending dirty text messages to women’s cell phones.  He went through this whole public scandal last year, and now he’s going through the exact same thing.  This time the woman is alleging a year long affair with Warren, and is going public because he refused to pay her to keep quiet (nice).  (I’m totally ignoring the 3 other women who also came forward within 2 weeks of her announcement).    The funniest part was what one of his teammates said in support of Shane during a press conference.  The guy basically said it was a shame that some “hairy-backed Sheila” (Aussie slang for girl) was doing this to him.  When I heard him say that on the news I almost spit out my drink!  Can you imagine Shaq coming out and calling the girl accusing Kobe Bryant of rape a “dog-faced skank”?  Okay, maybe Shaq is a bad example.  I can imagine him saying that.  Still...calling a girl a "hairy-backed Sheila" is just too funny...

      OK, gang...here's the deal.  I'm about 3 weeks behind on this thing...my bad.  The problem is that I have assignments due from now until the rest of the semester (YES, I still have to do schoolwork) so I won't have much time to spend on this.  I'll try to do bits and pieces, but can't make any promises.    I just got back from a week-long trip to Fraser Island which was tons of fun.  I hope to have it all down before I forget it all, but in the meantime, pictures will be up on Snapfish.com shortly.  Thanks for reading!

       Final Day, Friday   We didn’t leave until later in the afternoon, so after a little more beach time a group of us rented scooters.  I rented a little scooter/car looking thing that sat two people.  Needless to say, we got a lot of stares cruising up and down the street.  We rolled back into Sydney at about 7:30 AM, a whole hour ahead of schedule.  Ours was the first bus to come by so we didn’t have to spend an hour saying goodbye to everyone.  That would have been annoying…

       6th day, Thursday   Today we left the island and headed back home.  We stopped off at the Australia Zoo, “home of the Crocodile Hunter!”.  You know, Steve Irwin?...The guy who shouts “Crikey!”  Anyway, he was actually there, but he wasn’t doing the croc show because he was doing some press conference with John Howard, Australia’s Prime Minister (like our president).  I did get a glancing picture of him…the “Crikey” guy, not John Howard.  I do have to say, our Secret Service agents are much better dressed than their Australian counterparts.  We spent that night further down the coast in Surfer’s Paradise and had dinner at the Hard Rock Café there.

       5th day, Wed   Lake Mckenzie is, without a doubt, the crown jewel of Fraser Island.  It was unfortunate that we only got to spend an hour and a half there.  It was beautiful!  And fresh water!!  The lake is filled entirely by rain water, and the sand can be used to exfoliate your skin, shine your gold and silver, even brush your teeth!  I didn’t try that though   In the afternoon, we went to Lake Wabby.  I spent most of the day saying, “Wabbywabbywabby” because it’s just so darn fun.  It was about 2 km to the lake, so it was a near 30 minute walk uphill in what looked like desert.  The lake will be gone in about 40 years because the sand dunes are slowly filling it in.

       September 29, 2003	3d Day, Monday    Third day was spent driving up to Hervey (pronounced “Harvey”…don’t ask me why) Bay, Queensland to catch the ferry to Fraser Island.  Once we got to the World Heritage Listed Fraser Island (the largest sand island in the world, by the way), we spent the rest of the afternoon actually getting to the “resort”.  We rode this charter bus with monster truck tires (spelled “tyres” here) through the rainforest and looked around a bit.    September 30, 2003	4th day, Tuesday   In retrospect, though enjoyable this day was probably the most disappointing day.  We did a lot of walking and driving to places that were just nice.  We did get to see humpbacked whales swimming off the coast at Indian Head, though.  That was cool.  The most memorable thing that happened was the bus getting stuck in the sand on the beach.  It hasn’t rained on the island in while so the sand was really soft (part of the reason we had to walk some places was because the bus couldn’t get through).  We all (and by “all” I mean the guys, and by the “guys” I mean the ones that weren’t too wussy) got down and had to dig the sand out from underneath the wheels and push the bus.  Digging of the sand worked well.  I’m a little doubtful how much the pushing helped.

      New Zealand is cold and rainy...:(  The place we stayed at last night was called "Outlaws" and it was all done up in a saloon theme.  I guess they were trying to make us feel at home :)  There played country music in the restaurant, even working in Robert Earl Keen's "The Road Goes On Forever".  That was a surprise.  I'm not really sure where we are going because I haven't memorized the itinerary like I usually do.  I know we are  staying at Lake Ohau tonight.  Other than that, my two main concerns at the moment are getting my ski cap from the bus and finding a New Zealand Rugby jersey that doesn't cost a huevo and a nalga.

      Just about to leave Airlie Beach, Queensland, but I thought I'd leave a little update.  We spent 3 days sailing around the Whitsunday Islands on an honest-to-goodness sailboat.  Snorkling was cool.   We leave in a few hours back to Sydney for the night before leaving (again) the next morning for 7 days in New Zealand.  I'm fine, except for my camera breaking.  I won't be able to get it fixed until I get back to the States :(

         Quick Australian language lesson      Australia is a very verbally lazy country.  They shorten pretty much every word and refuse to pronounce other letters completely (like 'r' at the end of words).  Here's a little mental list I've been keeping:    Sunnies --sunglasses   Bikies --bikers, as in motorcycle gang members; Calling them &quot;bikies&quot; is a little deceptive, they are actually pretty dangerous and were responsible for a lot of gang violence back in the 1970's.   Truckies --long-haul truckers   Brekky --breakfast   Arvo  --afternoon   Footy --football, usually rugby but it depends on where you are.   Swimmers / Cossies --swimwear; cossie is short for &quot;costume&quot;   Rellies  --the &quot;relatives&quot;, as in family   Stubbies  --short running shorts or beers that come in short bottles   Uni --(&quot;you-knee&quot;) university   Schoolie  --someone in grade school or high school; Their version of spring break here is called quot;Schoolies Week&quot;. All the kids flock to the Gold Coast and party.  Remember, the drinking age is 18 here.   Unco  —clumsy, oafish; short for uncoordinated   Povo --to look poor, cheap, etc., shortened form of "poverty" sort of; as in "I don't get paid until Friday so I've been eating Ramen noodles for lunch for work.  I must look so povo."    Pressies --presents or gifts

      Next Monday (Nov. 10) we leave for a sailing trip in the Whitesundays which is a chain of islands near the Great Barrier Reef (the world's largest living thing, did you know that?).  After that, Ana and I are going to New Zealand for a week.  This means I won't get back into Sydney until Nov. 25 so I'll be pretty quiet until then.  And since we are moving out of our house this week, I'm not going to have a phone number anymore so email is the best way to reach me.  Everyone have a good Thanksgiving for me!  I'll be back home on Dec. 9th...

      Ahhhh, it feels good to be home...sort of.  Not that it sort of feels good.  More that I'm sort of home.  I'm as "home" as I can be staying in other people's apartments.  It definitely feels good to be somewhere where people don't have accents.  No, I haven't been to East Austin lately :p  Quick recap of what's happened in the last MONTH (?! can that be right?).  New Zealand was not cold and rainy.  Christchurch was cold and rainy.  After a few hours on the road the weather turned absolutely gorgeous!  It was like that for four of the 7 days.  We were really lucky.  Pretty much everyone on our Contiki group was really cool which made it that much more fun.  I did find that All Blacks jersey I was looking for.  I bought it in New Zealand thinking it would be cheapest.  Turned out they were selling them in Sydney for *gulp* HALF of what I paid!  Let us never speak of this again...  I've been back a week and have gotten a cell phone, found an apartment, and found out it will be more of a pain in the ass finding a judicial clerkship and/or a job than I thought.  FUN!  I can't get that Outkast song "Hey Ya" out of my head.  To help, all the radio stations are playing it as often as possible.  I heard it  4 times  yesterday during the three hours I was driving around.    I haven't decided if I'm going to keep this up now that I'm home.  If you want me to,  urlLink email me .  I expect an overwhelming response...riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.

      Here's some stuff I forgot I wrote.  It's mostly cryptic 'cause I was doing it in a hurry.  Maybe I'll come back later and fill in the blanks...   Whitsundays  Panic leaving house; didn’t really finish packing.  Woke up at 4:30 AM!  Long day of traveling.  Airlie beach, well lagoon anyway.  3 days on a sailboat.  1 too many people = girls get to sleep on dry land w/ a real shower.  Team Ireland drinking at 9:45 am.  Snorkeling.  Dodgy dishes.  Pump toilet.  Food.  Rough 2d day.  Camera broke.  Lazy last day—postcard, bought harry potter.  Tiring day traveling back.  Back to the house for the last time.  Too many bags.  No taxis.  Crowded bus.  No place open to eat.  Had to wake up early the next day.   New Zealand  Hotel is actually attached to a restaurant called “Outlaws” that has a wild west theme right down the lyrics for “The Gambler” and “Rawhide” on the placemats.  Even has a 10 ft. outlaw in the front.  Met Mike, roommate and coming on the Contiki tour with us.  First morning…had to figure out which of the 2 contiki buses to get on.  We wanted “Toothpick’s” bus.  Was this a special tour for people w/ lisps?  Spent a few hours in Christchurch.  Weather sucked—cold and raining.  After driving an hour, everything cleared and weather was amazing for 4 days.  Couldn’t stop taking pictures (w/ Ana’s camera) of the scenery.  Beautiful mountains w/ green, rolling hills right beside them.  Signed up for a scenic flight over Mt. Cook (highest peak).  Stopped at a stone church by Lake Wakatipu.  Got some gorgeous pictures of the lake.  They ended up saving my $200 because the van for the scenic flight left while I was on the lake shore b/c no one could find me.  There was a wedding of a Japanese couple in the church going on…w/ a bagpipe player.  Lodge at Lake Ohau was amazing!!  Wouldn’t mind coming back here.  Starting to get to know folks.  A few other Americans, all undergrads incl. 1 from Baylor.  Mostly Australian w/ the rest Canadian, Hong Kong, and one from India.  Jennifer is in denial—London by way of NYC according to her…later the truth comes out, she’s from London by way of New Jersey.  One girl ate a  1 Kilogram T-bone steak!!!   That's 2.2 pounds for all the Americans out there.  I'm just glad I wasn't there to see it.

      Friday was a busy day for me.   It started with the aforementioned high school students visiting the law school.  Besides running out of breakfast snacks, everything went smoothly and ON TIME!!  Surprising, I know.  We got rave thank you's from the teachers so, hopefully, they weren't just being nice.  Right after that, I drove to Dallas for the "Freedom Festival."   urlLink Tim is marrying Erin , a good friend of mine from law school.  As a matter of fact, Erin was one of the first friends I made here.  It didn't hurt that she happened to be sitting next to a gorgeous 6'3 blonde at the time.  Anyway, they graciously asked me to be in their wedding party which is accompanied by certain duties.  One of those duties is getting the groom  very  drunk at least once.  Thankfully, Tim isn't down with the whole strip club bachelor party cliche because neither am I.  As much as I eschew participating in debauchery, I try not to infringe on others who want to have women rub on them in exchange for crumbled $1 bills.  We went to a Dallas Stars game ( urlLink Dallas won, 3-1 ).  My first hockey game, for what its worth.  I didn't realize that there are only 6 to a side-it seems like so many more on TV.  That may have to do with the line changes, they subsitute just by skating on and off the ice in groups.  Next we hit  urlLink Pete's Dueling Piano Bar  which was fun.  This was also where Tim proceeded to get drunk.  Another funny thing that happened was that the success of a guy in our group with the ladies seemed to vary inversely with their availability.  In other words, the only guys that got any play were the one's w/ girlfriends.  Don't worry ladies.  No one did anything wrong...in front of me, anyway.  JUST KIDDING!  Can you guess from my tone which one of us was the only single guy?  Yep, it was me.  :(  Oh well...  The best part of the night was Tim yelling at the cab driver on the way home, "SLOW DOWN!! You're doing, like, 90!!"  What makes this so funny is that we were   AT A STOP LIGHT!!    Another one of my favorite lines, "It's pilates, Jackass!"

      has a urlLink  funny ass show .  I haven't been able to stop saying, "What did the five fingas say to the face?  SLAP!!  I'm Rick James, bitch!" all week.  His sketch in the first season on what it would be like if the government paid reparations for slavery was hysterical.  NEWSCASTER: "On Wall Street today--Fubu, KFC, and (Def Jam Records?) announced a merger, creating the world's largest corporation.  Also, Lincoln has announced Navigator sales have shot up 5000% in the last 48 hours."

      For those of you who have been living under a rock for the last month (and for some reason came to this site first), Mel Gibson's movie comes out this week.  Some of the hubub has been over the selling of pendants in the shape of nails.  I'm a little at a loss as to why people are pissed about this.  I hear the "profiting off of Christ" argument, it just doesn't make sense.  How is a nail different from a cross or a crucifix?  Or have the people pissed off always been against that too, but had given up until this brought the issue up again?

      Charlie Brown said it best.  Sorry I've been out of touch for a while.  Two of the things I use the most have been acting up for me lately.  My truck and my laptop.  I think I've tracked down the trouble with both (OK, so the mechanic at the garage and his computer technically figured out what was wrong w/ my truck).  On top of that I have a bunch of student recruitment stuff to do.  We have 80 high school kids coming in tomorrow, and CRAP!!  I have to call some teachers now!.....gotta run...

      We talk to a lot of anal applicants in the admissions office.  We have this whole pile of stuff that applicants have sent their applications in with.  Folders, covers, pockets, even a 3-ring binder!  That one was the best...the person actually put each individual piece of paper in a separate plastic cover!  I can't even imagine how much time that took, assuming we weren't the only school the person applied to.  Tip to future applicants: Don't do that.  Please.  It just makes it more of a pain in the butt for whoever opens the mail at whatever law school you're applying to.  At least we haven't gotten any "Elle Woods"-esque personal statement videos...that I know of.

       urlLink Click here for the story.  I still can't believe I heard the words come out of Coach Barnett's mouth.  He was answering questions about an allegation made by a female kicker and former member of the football team (the only female to score in NCAA football history,  urlLink timeline here ) that she was   raped by a teammate!!!  .   This is what he said to reporters:  "It was obvious that Katie was not very good. She was awful. You know what guys do - they respect your ability. Katie was a girl, and  not only was she a girl , she was terrible. There's no other way to say it."  This man is an idiot.  All that other stuff about strippers, escorts, and booze at recruit parties is one thing.  It is no secret to anyone who knows anything about college football that  players  take recruits out to party.  Coaches tell them not to, but they do it anyway.  Granted, the coaches probably don't try to hard to find out exactly what's going on--as long as they stay out of trouble, most don't care.  But to be so publically dismissive of a rape allegation is unbelievable.  There is no way he can try to deny knowing Katie Hnida was harrassed by other players on the team.  I wasn't there, and I would bet the farm on it.  The UC administration needs to drop the hammer on their own program before the NCAA goes SMU-death penalty on their ass.

      It snowed in Austin last night!  Real, honest-to-goodness snow!  There was about 2 inches of  urlLink snow on my truck  this morning.  Some kids in my apartment complex made a 4 ft. tall snowman.  urlLink  My snowman was slightly less ambitious.   Leave me alone...Kids from the Valley don't exactly get a lot of practice making snowmen growing up.  The closest I can remember is when there was this mega-freeze in the mid-1980's.  Our Buick LeSaber had a layer of ice on it an inch and a half thick.  I got all bundled up to go outside and look at it.  Then, unbeknownst to my parents, I went inside and got a hammer.  I went back outside and proceeded to hit the car with the hammer to see if I could break the ice.  I was about 6, and it made sense at the time.  Actually, it still makes sense to me.  Is that bad?

The network just ran a teaser from the grocery store saying "Residents are preparing for the cold weather" in an ominous tone.  The funny part was that while the unseen voice was saying this, the camera zoomed in on one of the check out lines and bags with...you guessed it!  LIFE SAVING, WARMTH GIVING TORTILLA CHIPS!!!!  Local news folks are such morons...

      Yeah for me!  I've finally caught up with all the episodes of Alias and The West Wing that I missed while I was in Australia.  I got a little spoiled.  Now I have to wait a whole week to see the next one.  On a sad note, I'm still way behind on 24 which is really almost impossible to skip episodes without messing things up.  I'm missing one episode!  It's keeping me from moving on *sigh*.    I know, I know...life's really tough.

      I saw  urlLink Lost in Translation  last night with a friend of mine.  I've been keen on seeing this ever since I got back.  Everyone said it was great.  Nominated for this Oscar and that Golden Globe.  Bill Murray's best work, even.  Ya' know what?  I must have missed the point because I didn't think it was funny at all.  It WAS supposed to be funny, wasn't it?  I had the exact same feeling when I saw The Royal Tennenbaums.  I kept waiting for it to get funny, and it never did.  Shouldn't a comedy have at least a funny premise?  Shouldn't the main characters do funny things?   There were a few scenes that I probably would have laughed at had I not already been in "What the hell is this movie trying to say?" mode.  Oh, well.  At least I didn't have to pay for it.  Thanks, Mo!  (poor thing...she DID have to pay for it)

      I was listening to the news last week and this one almost had me blow OJ all over my beloved Eggos.  The story was about  urlLink testimony in Martha Stewart's insider trading tria l.  Martha's defense is trying to say that her broker's assistant was fixated on her (*sarcasm on* perfectly logical, who wouldn't be?  It's Martha freakin' Stewart! *sarcasm off) and basically set her up.  The defense produced emails this schlub wrote to his friends after he spoke to Stewart.  Apparently, she wasn't very nice to him on the phone.  This was the best part.  The text of one email read:  "Martha yelled at me again today, but I snapped in her face and she actually backed down! Baby put Ms. Martha in her place!!!"   Now I don't know what' s worse--that the guy refers to himself in the 3rd person in emails or that when doing so, calls himself "Baby."  No, wait.  Yeah, I do know which is worse.  Grown men shouldn't refer to themselves as "Baby."  The fact that he did it while telling someone how badass he was for standing up to Mean Martha Stewart makes it that much funnier.

       Last Notes From the Southern Hemisphere   "Where are you going?"  My answer was simply, "Home."  When people asked me where I was from, I always answered with a proud and emphatic, "Texas." (with an added twang if I felt like messing with 'em)  This time, Texas was an afterthought.  I was headed Home.    Home to my truck.  Home to my ranch. (I know you were wondering...The answer is yes, you can get more stereotypically Texan than owning a truck and living on a ranch.)  Home to chicken fried steaks, Whataburger, and free local phone calls.  Home to  real  lemonade, Eggo waffles, and Totino's Pizzas.   The mass of $2 coins jingling in my pockets is replaced by $1 bills folded neatly in my wallet.  I'm returning to Chevrolets, Ford F-150's, and Cadillacs, never to see another  urlLink Holden .  I can now go buy something at 10 PM at most places in town instead of having to wait for Sydney's famous "Late Night Shopping" on Thursday's when stores stay open until  9 PM!!!   I may never have Gelato at Circular Quay, but I do miss Amy's Ice Cream and Blizzard's from Dairy Queen.  (Brief aside: Have you notice how expensive Blizzard's are? I remember when they were 99 cents!  I am getting old...)  I am thankfully leaving behind fried rice balls (which I am fairly certain are entirely a creation of this little, overpriced Mexican restaurant in Sydney) and coming back to my Mom's homemade tortillas and Chuy's chips and Chuychangas.  Did I mention I also got an extra day?  Well not really.  I never got a July 10th, so whoever it is that took it decided to give me two December 9ths.  Quite an odd thing really.  I'm just glad my birthday wasn't on the July 10th.  How much would that suck?

      We've got a big one coming up, kids.  This friday is the Law School's Prospective Students Day.  We've got about 150 folks coming and its my committee's responsibility to make sure they are wowed.  Granted, many are folks that have no desire to go anywhere but UT, and that is flattering.  Our big task is convincing all those who are on the fence to choose to spend the next three years in Austin instead of Boston, New York, Palo Alto, etc.  Not easy, but not as hard as some of you might think.  My committee chair for this event has done a great job planning so I am really looking forward to seeing everything work out.  We've got tours, mock classes, info sessions from financial aid, the Career Services Office, and study abroad, guided apartment tours, meal, mixers, and a DANCING BEAR!!  Ok, so there's no dancing bear.  We tried to get Bevo, but it has this little problem with loose bowels.  (Lesson kids:  Long term use of animal tranqualizers DOES have lasting effects.)  I know this week is going to be good because I won a raffle in my Texas Civil Procedure class for a free quiz grade!!!  This is VERY important because I have already missed two quizzes thus far.  Silly me...

      County Commissioner (CC):  Ya' know...we really need to do something 'bout them gays. Councy Attorney (CA): Um... CC:  Can we ban 'em? CA:  What, like, totally?  I don't think... CC:  Shoot yeah!  It shouldn't be that hard.  The council can just have a vote--that wouldn't be a problem.  Everybody in these parts supports good, old fashioned American values.  This thing'll sail through. CA:  Um, actually...I'm pretty sure it would be unconstitutional, not to mention impractical.  Would you... CC:  Oh, this is gonna be great.  Wait'll I tell the boys down at the barber shop!  YEEEEE-haw!  I know we weren't able to fire that school teacher for teaching evolution (what a crock that is), but this is even better.  We'll have a parade and check ID's at the county line...Wait.  What did you say? CA:  It's unconstitutional. CC:  Un-con-sti-what? CA:  It means we can't do it. CC:  So we can't require homos to have little rainbows on their driver's licenses so we can pick them out? CA:  Um...No. CC:  Ahh, you're just paranoid.  We'll do it anyway...right after the church social, before the stoning.  I'm not positive that's how it went, but I have a feeling.   urlLink Click here  to read about Rhea County, TN 's attempts to ban gays.

      Time continues to pass at break-neck speed.  My spring break was mostly boring, with two major events serving as bookends.  The first weekend was  urlLink Wrestlemania XX .  Before you laugh, pause to consider this--that's 20 years, people!  It was 4 hours from Madison Square Garden, most of which was entertaining.  The best part was that Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit walked away with their respective heavyweight titles.  For the uninitiated, those two have been in the biz for years, wrestling literally all over the world, and have never gotten the credit they deserve.  Maybe one of these days I'll inform y'all on why you should respect what wrestlers do.  The other major event was the wedding of two very good friends of mine,  urlLink Erin and Tim.   OK, so that is probably a little more important than Wrestlemania.  It was really beautiful.  I was really honored to be a groomsman.  Imagine what it means to tell a person that you want them standing next to you on the most important day of your life...and I got to wear a tux.  That's always cool.  North Carolina was a pretty place.  I was reminded I was in the heart of tobacco country when I walked into the terminal at the airport and it smelled like cigarettes.  Then I got in my rental car, and the radio was set to a NASCAR race.  I didn't know it was possible to cover NASCAR on the radio (Announcer:  The field turns left...now the leaders are going straight...WHOA!  A left turn...), but apparently it is.  On the plane, I sat next to a woman who was an accountant from New Zealand who, after taking a 2-year contract job in the Bahamas, met her future husband and has been in the Bahamas ever since.  She and her husband now run a furniture business (which is why she was in Greensboro, N.C., a furniture mecca).  How's that for a life story?

      Just Saturday, actually.  First, A&F was  awesome !  By far the best in my short time here.  Joey did a great job writing.  Ron and the rest did a great job choosing and playing the songs.  Amy, Melissa, et. al. in Medley were great, too.  It's a cool feeling to see so many of my friends getting to dislpay their talents.    Speaking of talents, my friend Karen gave me a copy of her debut album which, I must say, was off the hizzie.  Ok, maybe I shouldn't say that...but it was really good.  I wish the "only MC with a JD" tons of luck in the future.  After A&F, I hit not 1, but  TWO  spots downtown.  Seriously, I am WAY over my quota for the semester.  The A&F after party was on the east side of 6th street!  I deserve combat pay for wading my way through the drunken, half-naked undergrads.  Then again, perhaps it is it's own reward...

      I got another rejection letter from a judge this week.  I can add Beaumont to the list of backwater places that don't want my services, joining the state of Kentucky.  Just kidding, far be it from me to be bitter.  The weird thing was that Judge Hines actually listed the name and school of the person who got the clerkship.  I should Google them later...then maybe a dead fish in the mail.  Just a thought.  My friend Mark and I just finished working on my truck.  Notice I hesitate to use the word "fix."  Call it caution on my part.  I just feel bad about the pool of enging coolant we left in the parking lot.  If you live in San Marcos, try not to drink the water for the next, oh, 30 years or so.  This ad paid for by  urlLink Ozarka.   At school, I spent 2 hours talking to an admitted student about where he should go to law school.  Obviously, I was trying to convince him to come to UT.  His dilemma was between Texas and UC-Boulder.  Not much of a question, really, but for him it was.  It really is a tough thing.  As much as I think Texas is the right fit for most folks out there, I know that it is not for everyone.  Piece of advice for all you applicants out there--Ultimately, you have to go to the school where you feel most comfortable.  3 years goes by in a flash, but it can seem like eternity if you end up at a school that makes you miserable.  Most people would agree Texas is worth the loans.  Law school is an investment.  I have a feeling we are going to lose some students this year who will make exactly that choice, but between Texas and Harvard/Yale/Stanford etc.  Whatever you do, you owe it to yourself to visit schools before making your final decision.   urlLink COME TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS DAY!!!   That's my own plug :)  urlLink  Assualt & Flattery  is tomorrow night...I'll let you know how it goes...

      I can't believe I watched the Oscars from beginning to end last night.  I went with some friends (and some strangers, it turned out) to the Oscar party at the  urlLink Alamo Drafthouse.   It was a bit of a hoot.  The group that won best costume was  urlLink 7 mom's wearing old bride's maids dresses.   My friend Cydni actually won a poster of the LOTR: Return of the King signed by Peter Jackson in one of the raffles.  She's a pretty lucky gal.  I don't mind...my philly cheesesteak was pretty good.  Though I was hellu dissappointed when we ordered cookies and they brought us Chips A'hoy.  Can you say, "Party foul?"  The apple pie made up for it...a little.

      I am entering what is most likely the last final exam period of my life.  Why am I so sad?  Probably because I am a nerd at heart and love going to school.  Now THAT is something to be sad about!  I finally saw a copy of the law school yearbook the other day.  My copy is waiting for me on main campus, which is why I still don't have it.  I'll wait untill more of the great unwashed masses of undergrads skedaddle for the summer before getting over there.  Anyway, the reason I mention it is because I have once again managed to be virutally nonexistant in the book.  Going back to high school, I've had this knack for being very involved in school, but not being anywhere in the year book.   The worse one was when I was the lead in the senior play, and the play did not get a single page in the annual!  I gave a tour de force performance, dammit!  This time it isn't so bad.  I'm just missing from the group pictures of every organiza tion I belong to.  Same thing will happen next year, even for SROC!  Somewhere along the line I developed this complex about being recognized for what I do and I somehow have tied recognition to appearance in a year book.  I don't know what I'm going to do when I'm out of school.  Maybe I'll start my own :)  I'll be a little slow for the next couple of weeks due to finals.  I plan on writing a bit about what I wish I had done in law school for any of you that are just starting out, so check back.  Wish me luck!

      To point my finger at America and yell,  "YOU STUPID, MORONIC, MOUTH-BREATHING, IDIOTS!!!!"   Why the  urlLink vitriol ?  Did you see the travesty that was  urlLink American Idol  last night?!    Once again, my fellow Americans have dissapointed me.  I can understand when we can't pick the right President or a bunch of us choose another actor to be governor; that doesn't bother me.  The one thing I thought the American public would be able to handle would be voting for our next pop star.  I mean, this is the country that practically invented pop culture!  The last two competitions have proceeded pretty much the way they should have, with a few minor exceptions.  While I personally would never have chosen  urlLink George Huff  ,  urlLink Matt Rogers  or  especially   urlLink Jon Peter Lewis , I agreed with the judges that this was the strongest 12, top to bottom, so far.  But how in the world does one of the 3 "Divas" of the show, undoubtedly one of the most talented singers and performers, not to mention the  TOP VOTE GETTER LAST WEEK , get sent home?!!  I smell voter fraud.  It is an absolute travesty that  urlLink Jennifer Hudson  is watching the rest of the show at home, while  urlLink John Stevens  is forced to suffer through another horrible week knowing he doesn't deserve to be here and must die another slow, painful death on stage in front of millions of people.  SHAME ON YOU, AMERICA!  Is it strange that a 25-year-old heterosexual male has opinions this strong on American Idol?  Naaaaaaaahhhhhhhh....

They join other such hits as recent favorite-turned-vomit inducer  urlLink "Hey Ya" by Outkast  and that song from the Quizno's commercial.

      This is the first Easter I can remember where the weather has been crappy.  I always figured God had a little pull in that department and could "arrange" good weather for special occassions like rising from the dead.  I still haven't turned in my 25 words.  I missed another TX civil procedure quiz, and this one was a BIG one.  I don't know what my problem is.  The others I just didn't prioritized, but I really meant to do this one.  I even put it on my calendar!  I've been having this strange feeling, lately.  No, not that one; I got some pills for that.  No, this feeling is almost like senior-itis.  My grades actually DO matter since any job I get will likely be after grades come out.  My job now should be trying to get said job.  Yet with all that, I keep deciding to go out with my friends as much as I can.  This is the last time I'll be able to hang out with most of the friends I've made in the last three years.  I guess that's a more powerful force than some are able to admit.   Yes,  I'm a big weenie.  So sue me :)

      PSD went great!!   The weather sucked, though.  It was perfect the day before and the day after so I hope everybody got a little taste of it before they had to leave.  All the feedback I got was positive.  The "kids" were all a little pooped by the end of the day.  Who knew sitting on your but could be so tiring?  It was probably our fault for loading them up with barbecued beast flesh at lunch.  Maybe next year we could spike their iced tea with Red Bull to keep them going.  Bad news, to me anyway, was that the  urlLink U.S. News and World Reports law school rankings  came out last week and we are 15.  It doesn't mean that we dropped so much as some school got loose and got above us...I think.  I don't really have last years list memorized.  I haven't seen the actual magazine with all the specific category rankings so maybe there is something good there.  This isn't the end of the world, by any means.  Just a little disappointing.   On another front, as part of our graduation ( urlLink the Sunflower Ceremony ), every graduate gets 25 words read by the dean of student affairs as we walk across the stage.    25 words?!     What am I supposed to do with that?!  Do you have any idea how hard it is to be funny in 25 words without using props or fart noises?  They were due Friday, but I got an extension.  Not that this weeke is any less busy.  I promised 2 good friends of mine I would be a witness in their mock trial rounds Monday and Wednesday.  There go those nights.  At least they appreciate that I will be missing the NCAA championship game.  Aren't I such a good friend?

      Sorry to be away so long.  Finals are over, as well as graduation.  BarBri started yesterday.  I never knew 3+ hours of filling in blanks could be so boring.  No, wait...yes I did.  The bad news is that it will still be a while before the blog gets back on its feet because my laptop is currently in pieces in a box in my apartment. (Don't worry, I know exactly where each of the 40+ different sized screws goes...I think.)  I really don't feel like doing this from the computers in my apartment complex's office, despite that being exactly what I am doing right now.

For good measure, a friend from Australia is visiting this week and I have to throw my name into the hat for my perfect job by the end of the week.  Why am I breathing so hard?

      That big, steaming pile of crap in my rear view mirror is not Waco, NO!  It is the Texas Bar Exam!  It is times like this I wish I was a more emotional person.  I should be dancing and singing and drinking (a little).  Instead, I'm blogging.  I'll probably go out somewhere tonight...unless, of course, the torrential downpour plus my natural circadian rythms combine to force me to sleep by 10 PM.    I can definitely say that studying for the Bar was worse than actually taking it.  This assumes that one studies for the Bar exam.  The first day is the half day, not bad at all.  The Civil & Criminal Procedure/Evidence short answer isn't really  that  bad.  They tend to test the same group of stuff every year, more or less, judging from old tests.  The MPT is more annoying than anything else.  Anyone going into law will innevitably be asked to write a memo at 4:00 PM on Friday that is due by 5:00 PM.  This is the same thing...actually it's easier because all your research is given to you.    The MBE, the multi-state multiple choice portion, wasn't that bad.  Then again, I kinda like multiple choice exams...yes, I know that is weird.  Some people felt that it was harder than they expected.  It did have a lot of questions in areas that had been on old exams or really been emphasized in BarBri.     The last day, the 12 essays, is the worst.  The only thing that kept me going was all the pretty colored answer books.  Green, light green, red, pink, yellow, gold, blue, lavender (yes, lavender...not purple), tan (blech!),  and I can't remember the other two.  We were the lucky class to have an Oil & Gas question.  Everyone taking it the next three years should be thankful we bit the bullet for you,   Homer Simpson voice on>  BE THANKFUL!  Homer Simpson voice off>.      Now it's all in the hands of the curve.  I heard that only one guy from Austin's BarBri class failed the Bar last year, and   he was on Law Review!    Apparantly, it was a combination of arrogance and the realization that he wasn't as smart as he thought he was a little too late.  That kinda sucks for other folks though, because it means that most of the roughly 30% that fail are concentrated in Houston and Dallas.    Now I've got to go into preparation mode for my 2,200 mile move to my new job in Idaho!  Maybe I'll go for some test drives tomorrow.  I'm looking to buy a car before I move.  Anyone with suggestions, feel free to drop in a comment.  The main requirement is four-wheel drive for the ice and snow.    I started this at 7pm and it is now 9:15pm.   I'm not sleepy, but I probably won't go out unless one of a short list of people call and invite.  Is it  you?

Things have been really hectic between job search and studying (or not) for the  urlLink Bar exam  (which, if any of you are wondering, is not the best way to spend a summer...I suggest something more fun, like sticking your head in a microwave with a mouth full of aluminum foil).    The good news is that I have indeed landed gainful employment in an admissions office. Unfortunately, it is far, far from the Lone Star State.

      I'm sitting in my should-be-more-empty-by-now apartment thankful that a few of my neighbors don't feel the need to secure their wireless internet signal.  Seriously, I'd be bouncing off of the walls right now if I didn't have internet access.  I wanted to drive my new car around some more before I tow the trailer with it, but it seems unhitching the trailer is significantly harder when it's full of stuff.  I did finally get someone to come with me, one of my best friends from high school.  The only thing that sucks is that is new manager at work wouldn't let him take an extra day off without finding someone to cover for him, which he wasn't able to do.  Apparantly, there aren't many people who work 8am to 6pm who wouldn't mind working 2pm to 2am.  Who knew?  We'll be leaving sometime around 1am tonight, then breakfast and lunch with somefriends of mine in Dallas.  Wednesday afternoon we'll head to Amarillo and as much further as we can get before we get tired.  Thursday will get us to Santa Fe and Taos, NM and all the way to Denver by nightfall.  If we make good time on Wednesday, we may be able to push a few more hours past Denver.  On Friday, we'll have a long stretch (about 10 hours) from Denver to Salt Lake City, Utah.  After S.L.C., we will only have 11 hours to go before we get to Moscow and my new home.  Well, maybe "home" is too strong a word for right now...let's go with "domicile" (nice legal word) for now.  I have a feeling this is going to go by much faster than I thought it was.

      Talk about whirlwind!  In 3 days I went from homeless with an 8 year old truck that made a new noise everyday to signing a lease on an 1100 sq. ft. condo in Idaho and a brand new Honda Pilot!  I feel almost grown up.  I'm guessing I'll feel  all  grown up when I actually get the car on Saturday and when I get the keys to my place.  My landlord (described by self and others as "eccentric") has already mailed me the keys.   I'm still trying to find someone who wants to drive with me.  2200 miles is a long way to go by myself.  The drive should be really pretty, though.  I'm planning on going through Santa Fe, N.M., Denver, Co., Salt Lake City, Ut., and Boise, Id.  4 days of 10 hours a day, or 3 days of 14 should do it.  Man, that's a lot of driving!

      The Jefferson County (Beaumont) commissioners have voted to change the name of one of their county roads. ( urlLink Full story  above) The previous name was "Jap Road." Yes, you read that right. Aside from the fact that it took this long for enough people to care the word is a racial slur, those opposed to the change actually defended it saying it "honored" the Japanese farmer (I sh*t you not) that lived there in 1905. I'm sure that the city of Austin really had to debate hard to decide between "Cesar Chavez Blvd." and "Dirty Spic Lane."  The other thing that bothers me is that they changed the name to recognize a restaurant that was on the road for 30 years that closed recently. Hmmmmmm..."The name honors the Mayumi family patriarch."...How can we change the name and still honor him? Mayumi Road? "Naaahhhh, lets just go in another direction." That just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Like "Jap Road" was OK, but "Mayumi Road" is just  too  "foreign."  Am I crazy?  NOTE: I'm sure the majority of Beamont-ians are nice, well-meaning, educated...well nice and well-meaning anyway. But there seems to be enough that aren't to make this non-story a story, ya know?

      Things are getting down and dirty now, gang.  Even though I've known when I would have to leave Austin, it still freaks me out as being too soon.  I think I would feel better if I had a place to live up there.  (BTW, there's some guy has a rather extensive  urlLink photo tour of the Moscow area  if you want to check it out.)  I emailed some folks who are going to help me, but it's still 7am there so I don't expect anything until later.  The other big mind drain right now is buying a car.  Initially, I thought I wanted a  urlLink Toyota Tundra , but I wasn't totally impressed after test driving (it seemed even smaller that I thought it would be).  I also looked at the  urlLink Toyota Highlander  which I thought was pretty OK.  My Dad wants me to look at the  urlLink H0nda Pilot , but they are very popular right now and would probably be out of my price range because the dealers aren't really "dealing."  I also want to test drive those new  urlLink Chevy Colorado / urlLink GMC Canyons , but it seems they are hard to come by.  Hardly anyone withing 200 miles has the model I would want. *sigh*  I wish I had more than 2, check that, 1.5 weeks.
