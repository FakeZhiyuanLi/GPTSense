      Article #1 Google IPO  inspiration AJC Friday 4/30/04  Google’s IPO 	   According to its filing, Google’s founders seem eager to start off life as a publicly traded company on the same path they are currently on, hoping to steer clear of some of the unfortunate dealings and false promises of the last round of .com IPO’s. The founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page former Stanford University students initiated Google in 1998. They believe Google is an unconventional company therefore it needs an unconventional IPO.   The traditional IPO is the underwriter firm crunches a lot of numbers to com up with a price per share. That price is not to low so the sellers will make enough money to be worthwhile to sell the company in the first place. The price can’t be so high that the general public will not buy the shares either. The price per share should be on the low side of what the stock will trade for in the long run. The price per share is offered to insiders to flip or sell off at an inflated price. The few dot-com millionaires the mid 90’s produced. The public did not respond well to the few that got rich and the majority suffered the .com .crash.   Google’s IPO will be a bit different. The company will have a Dutch auction for the stock. If you eBay you know what a Dutch action is. If you don’t here it is. A person wanting to buy Google stock will have to open an account with one of the two underwriters, CSFB or Morgan Stanley. You will have to order a Google company prospective. Next register for a buyer id then it’s off to the races, the bidding is on. You haven’t felt this alive since your bachelor party in Vegas. You bid and bid and before you know it you are the proud owner of a 1987 porcelain figurine, wait wrong auction.  You put in your bid of how many shares and how much you are willing to pay per share. Then you wait! After the close of the auction the IPO price will be announced. The underwriters will crunch more numbers by gathering all the bids and calculating the cut off point at or above which all the shares available can be sold.   The final price will be the lowest price bid at or above the feasible selling limit preset by the first round of number crunching. After every thing is said and done Google should go for what any publicly owned company should be priced at… what the share holders are willing to pay for it.

      Wednesday, May 19, 2004  urlLink Cingular agrees to buy AT&T Wireless  MSNBC web   Cell phone plans have gotten so inexpensive in the last couple of years. More people are moving to them as their home phone. Combining two communication bills into one. This was helped along by wireless companies that bundled long distance into the wireless package prices. I am one of those people that have dumped my local baby bell too embrace my wireless provider as my source for communication. There are six major wireless providers in the US: Version wireless, Cingular wireless, AT&T wireless, Sprint PCS, Nextel, and T-Mobile In that order.    The number of wireless providers in the US is about to be reduced by one. The second and third largest are about to become one. Atlanta based Cingular wireless (a joint venture between SBC Communications Inc. of San Antonio and BellSouth Corp. of Atlanta) has set out to buy AT&T wireless. AT&T who was hurt more than helped by the new local portability law. Also the company was unable to add new subscribers for a time due to a glitch in the new software rollout that was supposed to improve the company’s customer service. Add the company’s 6 billion dollars of debt and you get a company that is ripe for buy out or take over.   The deal that was approved by AT&T’s board February 17, 2004 was for Cingular to buy the stock for fifteen dollars a share and assume the 6 billion dollars of AT&T debt. Cingular would then be the # 1 wireless carrier in the US with over 48 million subscribers. Currently the number one wireless company is Verizon wireless with 38 million subscribers. The buyout would place AT&T selling price at a mire 41 billion dollars or the equivalent of one Bill Gates.   Cingular has said there will be layoffs of redundant positions. In other words “you’re all fired”! The CEO of Cingular will not state just how many jobs will be lost.  The CEO of AT&T has said he will not be around at the new company under the Cingular name “We don’t need two new CEOs.”

      HOME DEPOT TO ACQUIRE WHITE CAP CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY  urlLink Google news   5/12/2004   urlLink HOME DEPOT TO ACQUIRE WHITE CAP CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY    I will take this opportunity to give a little insight on my company. I would relate this article to my paper to the employees of White Cap Construction. I have a unique perspective of Home Depot corporate culture being that I work for Home Depot. I started my employment at Home Depot about a year ago. The hiring process took time, a long time! Two months later I found myself at Home Depot new hirer orientation. This is a class that all new hire employees must go though. The parking lot associates to Bob Nardelli himself. I though this is a great idea to help new hires adapt and learn about the Home Depot corporate culture. What we were told did not hold true as I entered into my actual job.  As I joined the rest of the Home Depot’s work force I quickly learned that things aren’t done as they used to be. The orientation class was designed at the time when Bernie and Arthur where the boss. The standards were: take care of the employee and the employee will take care of the company. The new boss had his eyes set on a different set of standards. Those were the sales and bottom-line. I was slowly informed of this change, both through long time employees and my own experiences. Learning this I was disappointed, I thought I could start a career at Home Depot.   	 One of the Home Depot core ideals is that employees would have lateral movement within the store or company as a hole. Those current employees would have first dibs on new job openings within the store.  It has been my experience that the previous statement has not been true. I have seen many of my fellow Home Depot associates apply for jobs that they were well qualified for but did not get the job. Instead the Home Depot hired outside the company. I have been a victim of this disregard for corporate policies. I put in for several job changes but I was not called in for any interviews. Instead I find out after the fact that out side people were hired instead. I forgot to tell about the human resource policy in place stating that management must interview at least three current employees before hiring outside the company.  	 After seeing the practices of the Home Depot first hand I do no believe I would make a carrier of this job. I hope the employees of the White Cap Construction fair better than I have with my experience at this company.    urlLink
