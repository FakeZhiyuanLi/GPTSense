       urlLink    Chispa HATES gloves, because when she picks them up and shakes them, they slap her, and that only makes her angrier. A perfect example of the awful cycle of violence that inflicts dogs and American presidents alike. Except Chispa doesn't actually hurt anyone. I think Chispa should be the president of the US. She would certainly be better than what's his face. I mean, a ¨War on Gloves¨ makes more sense than a ¨War on Terror¨. At least gloves actually EXIST as concrete objects that can be ¨defeated¨! I mean GOD, how can you declare war on a CONCEPT or an emotion!? Terror... oi vay. I will now yield the floor to my collegue, Mr. Hat, the gentleman from Tasmania. He is here to talk about the war his son has declared on the monsters that live under his bed. THAT makes more sense than the ¨War on Terror¨ too.&nbsp; urlLink
