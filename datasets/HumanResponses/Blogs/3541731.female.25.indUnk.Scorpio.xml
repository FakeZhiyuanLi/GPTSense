      I haven't managed to quit smoking yet, have had a few today, and yesterday, but I'm planning to take it more seriously tommorrow and use patches. I wish I never took it up in the first place! That's all from me for now....

      I suppose there isn't much about me on this blog...I will be adding more as I get used to doing this.  I'm currently trying to stop smoking! I have tried hypnotherapy, and it didn't work for me! Apparently only people who are extroverted can get hypnotised, and I'm not really extroverted. So now I'm using patches, and they're working, but I really shouldn't let people at work con me to go out and have a ciggie.   Now some more about me....I am 26 this year, and I met someone today who has the same birth date as me, 11th of August 1978. And then we realised that there was someone else at work who also has the same birth date, bit of a spin out! Anyway, I was going to say some more about me, well I'm happily married, have two children, a dog, and a siamese fighter fish who I think is on the brink. I am desperately trying to save him by giving him some special stuff in his water every week, but he just sits at the bottom of the bowl. It's kind of sad to watch him actually. I don't have any special interests at the moment, seeing all I do is work, run around after my kids, and occasionally see my friends. My friends are rather odd. I can't have them all in the one room because they don't really like each other. Well most of them don't like one particular person because she is a yob. A yob who I don't think is talking to me at the moment because when her dickhead husband wanted to gloat to me, yet again, about what they were gonna buy, I told him I didn't care, that maybe he should worry about his bills and debts first! They are the sort of couple that have to try and 'keep up with the Jones's'But really they're trailer trash, so it's quite comical. I will tell more about that particular friend later as she has some interesting quirks.  I'm not a really interesting person, but my friends and family are, so I guess I will writing more about them.  My music tastes are pretty diverse, but I looooove NIN, Marilyn Manson, Garbage and Evanescence, and a few more.  Well that's it for me now.

      I have no idea why I am starting this blog....I don't have any idea how I'm going to be able to set it up either cos I don't know anything about creating web pages. Oh well, we'll see what happens.
