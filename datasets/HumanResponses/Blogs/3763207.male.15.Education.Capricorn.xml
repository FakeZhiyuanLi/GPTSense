      Dear people, firstly wanna say a big welcome to all you guys... This is the official ISIcell blog. From this week onwards there will be a big change in our cell, based on what I shared with you on Sunday during cell. Be Prepared for God is gonna make our cell grow in him.  Cell Procedure: 1) Prayer Prayer will be at 9.00 every Sunday. We will come together to pray for our cell and other cells on Sunday and the Youth Service. I (Minyang) will be leading the time of prayer. All of you are encouraged to join as I know that prayer is the only thing that can make the cell grow. Prayer can open up doors. Prayer strengthens you. When two or more gather in God's name, he is among them. So I encourage you to come join me in prayer for the cell. Prayer is also an indication of one's Spiritual Growth. So I hope that you guys and gal...Jean...haha.. can grow in Jesus through prayer. We will also interceed for other cells too. When we pray, I know that God will do a mighty work in our lives.  2) Worship Worship in cell will commence at 9.30 (God willing... Spirit allowing) if prayer has been completed. Every cell member should be in level 5 room 1 by 9.30. This requires Spiritual Discipline which I'm sure that you all can do it. Worship will be songs that we all know very well, so there would not be a need for songlists. Worship Leaders will be assigned by Minyang and will work and coordinate everything with Caleb. Secondary 2 members (ISI-2) will also join ISI for the combined worship.  Below are the assigned instrument players: Keyboard: Minyang, Ben Tan, Cheryl Guitar: Samuel, Enzheng, David Bass: Samuel and David? Drums: Caleb and maybe Joel if he can join us Every week instrument players would be rotated. Worship Leaders will be periodically assigned.  3) Word Word is an integral part of the cell. To heck with Bible Quiz. I want the word to sink deep deep into your hearts. I do not care how much you know about God, I care about how much you know Him. ISI and ISI-2 will go for their own cell. ISI will be in level 5 room 2, ISI-2 will be in level 5 room 1 (subjected to change). Guyz... open your hearts to let the word sink in. Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. To God be the glory  4) Warfare Warfare will be in your own cells. ISI and ISI-2 will have their own warfare. If needed, it can be combined with prior notice. The type of prayer that would be mainly practiced is conversational prayer. We will teach you on that as time goes by. THE FOUNDATION OF ISI IS PRAYER. I REPEAT: PRAYER!!!  5) Projectionists Projectionist on duty would be informed on Wednesday of that week and have to find their own replacements if they cannot make it and feedback to Minyang or Ben Tan by Saturday Night. Projectionist are to leave cell at 10.50 and to have everything set up and ready for 11.15. haha.. I will come and check on you and help u if u need help ar... so dun worry.
