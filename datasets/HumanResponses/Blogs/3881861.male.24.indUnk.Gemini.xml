      George Santos has ironed out his contract details and agreed a two year deal with the superhoops. The deal had been held up earlier this week after a number of "contractual issues" arose after the player had passed a medical on Monday.

      Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli has been linked with a move to the mighty super hoops, in a story which is probably as true as the rumor we were going to sign Roberto Baggio (no,really!)   The grey headed Italian is also believed to be weighing up&nbsp;offers from Qatar, Japan, Russia, Lyon &amp; Siena. My guess is the fact we have recently had large investment from a former Italian players agent means this won't be the last story like this we will seeing the near future and should be taken with a huge pinch of salt.

      George Santos has agreed a two year contract with the super hoops, he is set to have a medical on Monday where the deal is due to be confirmed.   Looking at various supporters messageboards the Ipswich fans seemed to be delighted to be getting rid of the big lump and some Rangers fans have written him off before he's kicked a ball for the club, which given Olly's past record in transfers for the club I find somewhat bizzare.  Anyway Santos is 34 years old and his previous clubs include Tranmere, West Brom, Sheffield United, Grimsby &amp; Ipswich.

      Derby County have officialy rejected and official offer (all very offical) from QPR for there fantastic super keeper Lee Camp.  This is what some bloke at Derby had to say about it:   "After speaking to George Burley I recommended to the board that we reject the offer".   "The bid doesn't meet our valuation of the player. In addition the timing is difficult because our new goalkeeping coach Mal Webster - who we believe is one of the best in the country - has only had a couple of weeks to assess the ability of our three main keepers."  There is no doubting Camp's ability and I would love to see him with us but Chris Day is a brilliant keeper in his own right so i dont think that we need to break the bank for young Lee but if a player of his abilty comes along you've got to try and get him if you can haven't you?

      The latest name to emerge from the QPR rumor mill is Ipswich Town's centre back George Santos the ex-Tranmere &amp; Sheffield United defender is believed to be in talks with us and Burnley, but im fairly confident if the rumor is true the opportunity to link up with a world class centre-back such as Arthur Gnohere will be too much of an opportunity to turn down.  &nbsp;  I cant really comment on Santos playing ability but he has involved in that big ruck when Sheff Utd v West Brom was abandoned and anyone who gets on sour-faced Gary Megson's tits is ok by me.

      Everybody's favorite blue and white haired skunk Mark Bircham is to return home from the clubs pre-season tour of Scotland after turning his ankle, he will have a scan in the next 24 hours which the club are hoping will only see him miss the next couple of weeks and be ready in time for the pre-season friendly against Brizzle Rovers (the true team of Bristol)

      Keep everything crossed but Big Dan Shittu is well on the road to recovery, according to reports he could be back before the originally estimated 9 months when he injured his knee against Bournemouth in January.  Don't know about you but I cant wait to see one of those Big Dan patented "shoulder barge through the advertising hoarding" the sooner the better.

      Ex QPR beanpole Peter Crouch joined Southampton today from Aston Villa for a reported fee of Â£2,000,000. Crouch was just about the only player who came out of the relegation season with any credit and is still highly thought of at Loftus Road.

Webber (59)   - went clean through thanks to another long punt and keystone cops defending, first effort was blocked by a combination of the post, Gino &amp; Chris Day but the rebound was clinically dispatched to wrap the game up for Watford. Suspicion of offside.
